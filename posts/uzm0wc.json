Raising pigs requires a significant amount of water to keep cool and hydrated, plus they consume the same food as humans unlike sheep or cows. So they are simply less efficient to raise in a area where water is a limited resource",

              "text": "The capital punishments described are quite clear and have existed since the Hebrew Old Testament. However everyone forgets that due process of law came from Abrahamic religion \n\nMeting out the punishment of these laws was just extremely difficult so it never really happened in practice, since ancient times. Capital punishment required a a few witnesses who had to actually see the penis inside the anus, vagina, animal, etc. Seeing two people naked in bed moaning and oscillating was not enough. The witness had to see the penis inside, with at least the tip fully submerged. On top of that 2+ people had to see it. \n\nThese witnesses had to be upstanding people as well - if one person came and told the court this witness lied on a business deal, doesn\u2019t go to temple, or beats his wife, visits prostitutes, the testimony wouldn\u2019t be allowed.\n\nIt simply wasn\u2019t possible to prove. You\u2019d have to have people watching it as some kind of show, but no religiously upstanding person could be there. \n\nFrom ancient to medieval to even modern times, consensual sodomy could never be proven. Only self-confessions (in court) worked, and even in those cases, there would be rabbis asking the person if he was sure and wasn\u2019t just dreaming or misremembering. \n\nHomosexuals were persecuted in other ways, being jailed or sidelined for other reasons. But capital punishment like the pastor in the article is talking about never happened",

              "text": "*Wednesday, Oetober 23, 2019*   \n*\"Bible, which is an old word for Book, is the most comprehensive*   \n*metaphor for what a mind is, what we are, possible and that particular*   \n*metaphor is wholly intentional and germane to its function. Every*   \n*metaphor starts with a perceptible that is transformed into an*   \n*intelligible; this transformation from the perceptible to the intelligible is*   \n*not comprehended by most people. Plato called it the ability to see the*   \n*similar idea in the many examples, or again, from the particular*   \n*perceptible things in our environment to be able to formulate a single*   \n*conception by which becomes a single intelligible; one can call this true*   \n*class mechanics. In modern terms it means memory addressing, putting*   \n*all things with a common element into a single computer directory or*   \n*directory structure and memory manipulation also known as thinking or*   \n*computing; keep in mind that these two are two distinct elements of just*   \n*one thing. Thus we can use our familiarity with the computer to come to*   \n*understand the single metaphor Book, in terms of Mind and psychology.*   \n*By those who imagine themselves intellectuals, the Bible is probably*   \n*not even studied or read by them. The common intellectual simply*   \n*observes those who claim to have studied it and by the behavior they*   \n*observe of these others dismiss the work as being nonsense after all, a*   \n*true intellectual learns to effect their own behavior to their advantage*   \n*and the Bible has overwhelming factual evidence that it is a source of*   \n*concern by the most mentally disadvantage portion of the population.*   \n*Although this method may appear to be efficient, a true intellectual*   \n*depends upon their own ability to comprehend anything, even those*   \n*things which appear to be useless, a drive to know is measured in terms*   \n*of being certain of one\u2019s judgments. By way of study, it takes a bit to*   \n*learn that the Bible is the only book in circulation which tells the reader*   \n*and tells the reader repeatedly that they cannot even read that book until*   \n*a certain time in human history; this means that the Bible is informing*   \n*the reader of evolution, the making of man; any intellectual would be*   \n*curious as to how the writers of the Bible prove their notion of evolution,*   \n*which, the Bible actually does; this essay, if you are patient, will prove*   \n*that concept of evolution is entirely correct and provable as the Book*   \n*introduces specific puzzles to solve by those who have actually evolved to*   \n*do so. These puzzles are aimed specifically at one thing, information*   \n*processing, the only thing a mind can do. The writer, or writers of that*   \n*Book also knew that the repeated statement that man can neither*   \n*comprehend nor read that Book would be proven by those who claim*   \n*that they can simply by the fact that past readers either did not notice*   \n*the puzzles or if they did, thought that they are solved by some cryptic*   \n*decoder ring fashion; the solution to these puzzles are solved by factual*   \n*binary information processing as every possible grammar is a method of*   \n*binary information processing. The Bible is a very deliberate tool used in*   \n*guided evolution; it provides intelligible stress to the reader; evolution is*   \n*aided by stress; for the other bodies life support systems the stress is*   \n*perceptible, but for a mind that stress has to be intelligible.*   \n*Therefore, this essay is aimed at being an aid to the reader becoming*   \n*aware of binary information processing, how to go from the perceptible*   \n*Adam and Eve to the intelligible. Conjugate Binary Pair, which is a*   \n*deliberate use of metaphor by the writers of the Bible. The Bible uses*   \n*principles of grammar which are factually provable while the human race*   \n*still does not have even one correct grammar book.\"*",

And ladies should have their heads covered. And in Deuteronomy, a marriage is only valid if the woman is a virgin, and she should be executed if she is not... and that anyone who commits adultery should be stoned to death. In Mark, divorce is prohibited. I assume for homosexuality, many of you are thinking of Leviticus 18:6: \"You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female. It is an abomination.\" A similar verse occurs two chapters later, in Leviticus 20:13: \"A man who sleeps with another man is an abomination and should be executed.\" Leviticus is a holiness code written 3,000 years ago. It also includes prohibitions against round haircuts, tattoos, working on the Sabbath, wearing garments of mixed fabrics, eating pork or shellfish, getting your fortunes told, and even playing with the skin of a pig (hope you're not a football fan). I believe in morality, which is doing right regardless of what I am told... not in religion, which is doing what I am told regardless of what is right. You're welcome to your own interpretation of the Bible and of politics, of course, but for me, I need more than \"the Bible says so\" to justify certain things in this world and certainly to judge them. \n\nReligion is at its best when it emphasizes spiritual experiences rather than received dogma\u201d",

Then your safe.\n\nIts a made up Authority fraud.\n\nIts why so many cults and other religions are based on the Christian frame work.\n\nAs in ( God speaks to me, I have magical knowledge, only through me can you have eternal life, )\n\n(Now do as I say or go to hell)\n\nThats how they function. \n\nIts why Christianity is a vile fraudulent superstitious nonsense that is inherently oppressive and naturally wrong.\n\nIts why so many abusers and narcissists are drawn to it. The use of it is abusive. \n\nIts not about love. It's about control it's always been about control. \n\nSome people say but jesus talks about love.\n\nJust imagine for a moment a young man going around claiming to be the son of God?\n\nDoes that strike you as a good decent rational person?\n\nHe gathers a group in rebellion against the romans and Jewish elders both are clearly courpt. He can't preach violence that will get him killed. So he talks about peaceful protest otherwise and despite it he gets killed by the romans. \n\nSo its easy to gather support. \n\nBuy all the stories about him are in truth made up nonsense by people seeking power. \n\n\nThe roman empire wanted a united empire not to have hundreds of religions. \n\nAll the magic stories around jesus are an effort to make him supposedly valid as a devine being. \n\nLook how absurd and hysterical cult people are they aren't mentally well. \n\nAll the abusers the narcissists the megalomaniac all get  hold of this book which is an evil thing because it's a how to control others.\n\nAnd they just tweak it a bit and make their own cult.",

If you stopped being so bothered and interested in other people's private affairs, that have fuck all to do with you, then maybe they wouldn't feel the need to create giant spectacular floats asking you to leave them alone.\n\nThis is your fault.

Whatever lawful/licit repercussions are appropriate must be meted out so that he is silenced properly, and if this includes mental psychoanalysis and the results of such being applied to stop his deadly rantings, then may it be.  I am a Christian myself, but I find Shelley's words to be nothing short of the most poisonous, repulsive, merciless, disgraceful, uncharitable, reprehensible, odious, hate-filled, cruel, barbaric, dehumanizing venom. None of my fellow Christians that are in my life would ever spew this sort of disgusting vomit (I would rebuke any trying to do so). He is no Christian but is a ravenous, rabid, and demented wolf with serious sickness in his mind, and many of his followers are tragically also blindly drinking the lethal Kool-Aid to their own potential shame and peril.  I detest and despise the sort of mindless and deficient/reckless hyperzealous attitude that he and others of his ilk foment with no proper discretion, discernment, or critical thinking being incorporated.  Using the Bible as a weapon as he is doing is pathetically wrong and wicked and is damnably-cultic.",
