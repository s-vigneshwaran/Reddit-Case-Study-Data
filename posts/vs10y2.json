As pointed out elsewhere on this thread, there are places where the time can shift by as much as 3 hours just by being on one side of a border or not. In these situations one person's 9am might be another person's noon.\n\nSecond, even if time zones were \"continuous\" such that noon was always midday and so on, there's still the matter of how the days change with season and latitude. Is it light at 9 am? Do people go to work then? It depends on a bunch of factors including culture and geography.",

By midnight I only heard some big stuff way off in the distance.  They've been setting them off every night.  Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday night.  Do you really need to still be setting them off Monday so late too?  And to think fireworks are illegal in my state.",

The explosions from fireworks are audible, in clear conditions, to a distance of just over 50 miles (closer to 52). Close enough to the poles, conditions are pretty clear, so let's say 50 miles.\n\nNear the poles, time zones will be quite evenly spaced (though not really observed, but so be it). 11 time zones or if 24 is about 46%. So we need a latitude at which 50 miles is about 46% of an east-west circle around the earth, giving a circle with a circumference of about 110 miles.\n\nLast piece. The circumference of earth by latitude is\nC=2\u03c0R\u00b7cos(\u03bb)\nWith \u03bb as the latitude.\n\nSolving gives a latitude of 89.75\u00ba.\n\nHowever... The farthest north that there's land (or that there's known to be) is shy of 84\u00baN. So no luck.",
