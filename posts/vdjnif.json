He gets pardoned, or absolved (I'm not familiar with religious jargon). And the following week he is at everything all over again. The guy is simply DESPICABLE,  and a total prick.

You can have the same A-Z plots with the same moral at the end of it, without having to have the baggage of Christianity stuck to it. Those stories can be rewritten in anyway with the same core message to it.. And learn to be a good person to be considerate, not for some prize.  \n\n\nIt is honestly the same thing about Christmas, why wait for that specific day to give gifts and spend time with people you love? Pick any day of the year to gather together. Why does giving your son an Xbox and eating food with your extended family have to be tied to Chrsitianity? We just need to drop that cult and stop giving it power. You can give a gift to your son, without it having to mean something, without it having to be on that day, without stapeling that irrelivant cult from some desert to it. People can't just do nice things, it needs a Chrisitanity label on it when they do it... It just isn't needed.",

And that was the mainstream church. FLDS follow leaders like Brigham Young. Brigham Young the second leader of the church said that if a white man mixes his seed with a black woman the penalty would be death on the spot. So much more the mainstream lds are not being truthful about in their history. Black folks were fence riders in the war in heaven, some leader said they could make it to the highest level but that they would be \u201cservants\u201d there.

I have been extremely busy all this time. Yes, I've heard of GAY Catholics, and GAY Republicans and I still can't comprehend this issue. Can you imagine a Black KKK? To me all three things are like the same: INCOMPREHENSIBLE. It may be as you say: cultural enviroment, and also lack of self-esteem. And in my opinion that is something RELIGION is truly good at. Deprive people of their self-esteem. The constant message is: \"Put yourself in the hands of the Almighty and you will be alright\".  Just yesterday I saw this documentary series: \"They call me Magic\". It's about the life of NBA Great Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson. As you surely know he got infected with the HIV virus back in the late 80's. He entered a very agressive medical treatment for the disease under a state-of the-art medical team. The team was led by world re-nowned HIV/AIDS researcher Dr. David Ho, and by Dr. Fauci. But you will never hear either name being uttered by \"Cookie\" Johnson, Earvin's wife. She only praised God, but never not once she thanked the doctors. Later in the film \"Magic\" does thank the doctors. But his wife never did. How can you even  understand something like that? \"Magic\" Johnson is still alive because of two things, and two things only: 1. SCIENCE  2. MONEY. I promise you GOD had never anything to do with it.",

In fact, I always tell everyone there are no black persons in Utah. I was staying in Salt Lake City. But, I also remember driving by a car dealership that read MALONE CARS DEALERSHIP in big letters. And I remember Karl Malone from the Dream Team, and for playing for the Utah Jazz. Still, I do not recall seeing one single black person in Salt Lake City. Honestly, I do not even understand why Black Americans are so committed to Christianity, either.  Christianity, and the Bible were the ideological foundations to justify the enslavement and forced shipment of millions of blacks to the Americas. I feel immensily frustrated watching Black Americans' total devotion to a white God that has never done absolutely anything good for them. But, what can you do, right? Thank you for your comment.",

                              "text": "Oh man, the stories I could personally tell you. \nIf you look into RTCs (residential treatment centers) particularly for minors (hint: involuntary). Utah is the capital of them, and so that definitely has a religious impact for better or worse. \n\nYou can also look into transporters (I was unfortunately a victim of this as well!) they are adults hired to take children to these treatment centers, but require no certification, background checks, etc. So in the USA, you need more rigorous certification for running a food stand than to take children across state lines with no contacts. I was handcuffed and told the police would arrest me if I tried to ask for help. \n\nParents often are either totally naive or totally abusive, and they count on this to keep funds incoming. Lying to parents (or ignoring extreme child abuse from parents), no phones besides when listening to by staff, letters not sent if not deemed acceptable by staff leaves children with literally no devices or places to even file complaints. They will literally hang up the phone if they don\u2019t like what you are saying. When parents do visit, everything is cleaned, food is put out, and everything swept under rug. \n\nChild abuse is the norm, even the best of the best have hundreds of incidents of sexual assault, abuse, emotional abuse, racism, sexism, gaslighting (like actual, honest to god, family ruining gas lighting), over meditation (hint:sedation), negligence, and more from staff to student and student to student. I experienced or witnessed every single one of those things in my time. And of course when you tell anyone this, the response tends to be \u201cbut that\u2019s illegal! Make a report! Call the police!\u201d\n\nThe police made sure to keep us there, and I\u2019m sure they knew. You can try to make reports to the department of human services. But then you have to get your records. Takes months of course, and thrown out after seven years (hint: they don\u2019t want you to have any evidence of what they do). You take those all in, and won\u2019t get replies for months. Send dozens of emails, get no replies. Try dozens of people, no replies. Reach out for interviews, anything, no replies or no one cares. It\u2019s hard, so so hard. \n\nObviously there are hundreds of details and stories and specifics I could share, if you ever want to chat just pm me. But now that I am an adult I am still realizing the extent of how wrong it all was. It\u2019s even harder when the government itself calls about a mental health crisis, but wont take any reports or care. (As for the shooters we always see, I can tell you that one of my centers had a shrine for parkland and \u201cattractive\u201d school shooters. Staff did not give a single fuck, it stayed up the entire time I was there. Nicholas Cruz would\u2019ve been worshipped in my treatment center. But sure, it\u2019s a mental health crisis that you care so much about) \n\nSorry for the rambling, but it really means a lot to have someone even show interest.\n\nEdit: also I didn\u2019t attend these but look into wilderness camps. So many friends I had were completely broken. Children taken out to the dessert with no outside world contact for months. Forced to be watched shower, girls nearly killing each other, abuse, starvation.\n\nCheck out r/troubledteens to get a general idea",

Obviously was a special kind of hell. Spent only a week there as they are short term. Later I spent two months in a short term live in facility in Connecticut. That one just felt very culty and ill. Later I was transported to the one in Utah, where I spent half a year. I most likely would have stayed a year or two more if I didn\u2019t do what I did. \n\nAnd what I did, was lie. I pretended to give in, follow the program. They liked it at first, until my parents thought I would be well enough to come home. Then they said I was \u201cfaking it now\u201d because I was \u201cprogressing too fast\u201d. I sure was, but far too late for them to backtrack. I\u2019m very lucky I was pulled. I had already made the decision that I would commit suicide if I wasn\u2019t. \n\nWhen I got home I hid it all, pretended I had \u201chealed\u201d because I was so fearful of going back. I hid knives all over my room in case I would be transported, but never really slept. Nightmares, flashbacks, lost 50 pounds, gained it, lost 60, constant brain fog, repressed memories, you name it. I drank a lot, more than before I left. My grades fell from 4.2 gpa to barely passing. I really only graduated high school because they felt bad for me, but I still damn graduated. \n\nI waited a few years until I was no longer a minor (again, involuntary treatment and no bodily autonomy is scary) and started opening up to my parents. It\u2019s hard, and our relationship suffered immensely, but now that we are seeing how much we were both truly lied to (it helps keep up the chaos and confusion), we can at least understand. \n\nAll in all, I\u2019m really messed up. Some days what keeps me going is spite. But, I don\u2019t drink anymore, at all. I haven\u2019t in over a year. I am learning to eat normally, I\u2019m back in school to work with kids struggling with mental health. I still put in the useless reports, because then I have documentation for when people will listen. I\u2019m in therapy, and I\u2019m trying harder than I ever have in my entire life.  \n\nThey took most of my childhood, my innocence, my will, and so many pieces I can never get back. However, they gave me a motivation like no other that is so strong some days it can give me goosebumps. Who is sleeping where I did? Who is hungry like I was? Who is scared and sad and lost like I was? Who are they screwing over for hundreds of thousands of dollars? It sucks for me that my biggest passion in life comes from my biggest traumas, but it\u2019s even worse news for them. \n\nSo really, thank you for listening. All I\u2019ve ever wanted is enough people to listen. The past few years, especially after Britney Spears and Paris Hilton, people have actually started to ask questions. And each time I get a boost because I remember just how wrong it really was, and how hard they tried to convince me it wasn\u2019t.",

It's pretty easy to \"other\" everyone in the outgroup when you don't ever interact with the outgroup.  However, they know their members are much more likely to actually listen to a family member or friend who has left, so the solution is to require the group to shun anyone who leaves.",

My GRANDMOTHER was illiterate. Back then slaves and children of slaves were banned from learning to read, and write. But, here in America I have found highly educated, middle or upper middle class blacks who are as devout Christians as my uneducated black Mother. And it gets even weirder. I learned Christianity as a whole (both Protestant and Catholic) is now the fastest growing religion in black Africa. It completely blows my mind! There must be very powerful economic, sociological,  and political reasons for that development. But I will have to educate myself in the issue before I get to a conclusion of any kind. Thanks.",

That's my motto. And the reason being just recently someone told me the word \"MULATTO\" is not acceptable in American English.  You would rather use \"BROWN\". I did not know that. I also learned the meaning of the word \"MONGREL\" online when I asked, and someone pointed out the meaning to me on one of these posts saying: \"Your son is one\". I'm black, and my wife is white. Our son is of mixed race. I had never even heard that word before,  let alone how it was used. But, you have to grow out of your concerns of being offended in social media. It's remote, and it's anonymous,  so it is a very useful tool to be used as a form of abuse. Thankfully that's not always the case. But, I have been called all kinds of names right here on REDDIT. At first I would refrain to counter. Not anymore. But it's better to know and that's the reason I always ask first. Thank you. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfff",

Of course, there might be someone that gets offended, just as people can be offended to be called African-American instead of black, but as far as I know, it is a very inoffensive term, and that's by design. \n\nBy the way, I completely agree with you on being offended on the internet. Of course everybody has the right to be offended, but as you said so well, the anonymity and impersonality the internet provides makes it a very fertile ground for offending someone, be it on purpose or not.\n\nHave a great week my friend!",

Hell no. As an Air Force vet, I can tell you from experience that a good third to almost half of those PT Scores are complete bullshit. The testing is almost always self/partner counted and reported. And since in your own self interest to report a passing score, and because the passing benchmarks are complete bullshit anyway, you like because you want to keep your job. The only numbers I would trust at all would be the running scores. And even those are shite because the entire test is basically just numbers someone came up with, that have nothing to do with actual physical capabilities. \n\nI find it hilarious that actual researchers looked at the Air Force pt system and thought \"Yeah! That's a good source of data!!\"",

In 2013, she told TV talk show host David Letterman, \u201cFor me, men\u2019s tennis and women\u2019s tennis are completely, almost, two separate sports. If I were to play (British star) Andy Murray, I would lose 6-0, 6-0 in five to six minutes, maybe 10 minutes. No, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s a completely different sport. The men are a lot faster and they serve harder, they hit harder, it\u2019s just a different game.\u201d\n\n\nWhen males reach puberty, their bodies begin producing large amounts of testosterone, the original, natural, performance-enhancing drug. It gives them increased strength, endurance, power, size and muscle mass, with less fat and bigger and denser bones, which can support bigger muscles and internal organs. The advantages of such hormones are so great that some athletes take synthetic hormones \u2014 anabolic steroids \u2014 to increase those advantages over their own sex.\n\nTestosterone accounts for the difference between male and female athletic performance, and that difference is one of the very reasons women\u2019s sports were created in the first place \u2014 to bring an even playing field. Other concessions have also been made for females \u2014 shorter tee boxes (golf), lower nets (volleyball) and hurdles (track), smaller implements (track and field) and smaller balls (basketball).\"\n\n\n[In search of a level playing field.

I already know why you haven't shared anything with me that says cis females have an advantage over born males. \n\n\"When males reach puberty, their bodies begin producing large amounts of testosterone, the original, natural, performance-enhancing drug. It gives them increased strength, endurance, power, size and muscle mass, with less fat and bigger and denser bones, which can support bigger muscles and internal organs. The advantages of such hormones are so great that some athletes take synthetic hormones \u2014 anabolic steroids \u2014 to increase those advantages over their own sex.\n\nTestosterone accounts for the difference between male and female athletic performance, and that difference is one of the very reasons women\u2019s sports were created in the first place \u2014 to bring an even playing field. Other concessions have also been made for females \u2014 shorter tee boxes (golf), lower nets (volleyball) and hurdles (track), smaller implements (track and field) and smaller balls (basketball).\n\n\nWith the emergence of male-to-female transgender athletes, the competitive concerns are obvious: The separation of the sexes is compromised and biological men could potentially deny women of opportunities they were denied at every level of sport for decades until the passage of Title IX in the \u201970s \u2014 scholarships, roster spots, contracts, prize money, medals \u2014 if not put them at increased risk of injury in contact sports (see sidebar note in which MTF fighter Fallon Fox seriously injured her female opponent in the first two minutes of their bout).\n\n\n\nJoanna Harper, a competitive transgender runner herself and a medical physicist, has done considerable research on transgender athletes in sport. \u201c\u2026 Allowing these athletes to compete in women\u2019s sport with their serious testosterone-based advantage threatens the very fabric of women\u2019s sport,\u201d she once said in a Q&A with exercise physiologist Ross Tucker.\n\nHarper, who has been a consultant for the IOC and World Athletics, told The Seattle Times, \u201cThe gender identity doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s the testosterone levels.\u201d\n\n[FACTS! ](https://www.deseret.com/2021/7/29/22584285/male-to-female-transgender-olympic-athletes-impact-womens-sports-president-biden-mike-lee-weigh-in?_amp=true))",

In 2013, she told TV talk show host David Letterman, \u201cFor me, men\u2019s tennis and women\u2019s tennis are completely, almost, two separate sports. If I were to play (British star) Andy Murray, I would lose 6-0, 6-0 in five to six minutes, maybe 10 minutes. No, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s a completely different sport. The men are a lot faster and they serve harder, they hit harder, it\u2019s just a different game.\u201d\n\nOk? A male is not the same as a transitioned female, so bad analogy, also, anecdotal comparison that is interesting, but ultimately meaningless. People saying how they feel about stuff means nothing against actual data. You keep throwing out these stories as if they mean anything. Why?\n\n>Testosterone accounts for the difference between male and female athletic performance, and that difference is one of the very reasons women\u2019s sports were created in the first place\n\nAnd HRT changes that. Making blanket statements and absolute judgements won't work in this. It's an entirely new area, with little data showing what needs to be done. It's not black and white. \n\n>When males reach puberty, their bodies begin producing large amounts of testosterone, the original, natural, performance-enhancing drug\n\nEvery argument made completely ignores prepuberty transitions.

I'm saying that it's not nearly as big of a problem as people make it out to be. Everyone's screaming that trans athletes have a huge advantage when the numbers say they don't. They're placing high, but they're definitely not *dominating* as people say. \n\n>Joanna Harper, a competitive transgender runner herself and a medical physicist, has done considerable research on transgender athletes in sport \n\nI'd love to see that research and what it says.

Now isn't that interesting! It's almost as if the fact that they're transgender doesn't matter! No shit?!\n\nBecause here's the other side of the coin that anti trans athletes never talk about, which is trans women who began transitioning young, and never developed all that testosterone, muscle mass, etc. Because that's what really matters. \n\nWhat we need is to change how sports are handled, how the performance brackets are decided and measured, and change how people think about gender in sports. Not blanket deny entry based on arbitrary definitions and outdated traditions.",

Have been on Twitter when transfolk have attacked feminists and threatened them with rape, muder and doxxed them. Drag queens and transfolk are like every other human being they are not special.\n\n\n\n>It teaches them variety of life, the beauty of the human body and acceptance of who you are as a human being in your own skin.\n\nThe school should teach them math, science, history civics etc etc. The variety of life etc can be taught by parents, life and experience. Not the schools place to teach this. \n\n>You don't understand drag so their automatically potential pedos but school staff are automatically safer. \n\n\nThere is nothing to understand here. Some people like to dress as caricatures albeit glamorous caricatures. Again why does that have to be shoved down school children's throats. If you want children to talk to trans people, bring in a trans person not stars dressed like a caricature. That would reinforce normalcy. \n\nThe school staff NEED to be in a school to teach children the curriculum. Drag queens don't. That you think the utility of having a maths teacher is somehow equivalent to having a drag queen in school says volumes. The risk of a necessity versus the risk of something that is useless can't be compared.",

You could probably amend the above quote to, \"any institution that claims a higher authority over an individual's conscience, can lead someone who is inclined to do good into committing evil acts.\"\n\n\nI think the reason religion is the worst of these offenders is because it claims to be the ultimate source of good and morality. A lot of these other examples ask that the individual forsake their own morality for \"the greater good\" according to the institution, but religion instead defines what good is. \"Do this or go against the all powerful omnibenevolent creator of the universe.\"",

I am using the comparison of worship toward lgbt ideology to make my point given that we are in the atheism subreddit.

A mormon church leader abusing children doesn't mean that transpeople are not doing so.\n\nIt is just bizarre that these two things were even linked in this way. They have nothing to do with each other but the event is being used to cast light upon one group as evil and the other as innocent.\n\nI think it rich that atheism, the subreddit that prides itself on rejecting fantasy and delusion delights in dunking on the religious for their insane beliefs but entirely adopts/protects the delusions of men who believe they are women and expect everyone else to play along. To the point of inserting them into a child abuse story in an attempt to showcase their collective virtue, as if trans people are all good automatically by virtue of being trans.   \n\"Church leader\" isn't a sexual/gender identifier so it has nothing to do with bathrooms. The suggestion is obviously a stupid and smug attempt at making a witty point.\n\nWhy would someone abusing children at a sleepover lead to them being banned from bathrooms? Which bathrooms? All of them? Or just the women's? What if the church leader identified as a women? \n\nThe whole thing is stupid. Transparently adding lgbt identity politics into an event that had nothing to do with it.",

Oddly enough I'm using the terms loosely, but really it only really needs to target the one major religion.   \n\n\nTo extend further enact something along the lines of the \"Practice What Your Preach Act\". Currently in my area the only ones that would stay tax-exempt would be the Sikh temples and Muslim mosques.. They are the ones that tend to allow anyone in (following their wardrobe rules) for a hot meal and if they wanted a place to worship said religion.   \n\n\nIn my Evangelic Christian upbringing; I remember many a luncheon after the service and tea/coffee before/during the service, but only members were allowed access. Sure there was 'outreach to the community' during major holidays, but again the meals weren't for everyone, only those that were wealthy enough to live with a roof over their head and therefore the ability to pay the church back. Took a while for me to understand the hypocrisy of this, even after my eyes were opened by a bible class teacher as to how stupid the religion's basis was.",

They arent in charge of really anything beyond some person that volunteered to lead the kids in songs and given a list of talking points or whatever they go over before the kids split into age group classes. Everyone is assigned little roles to help or given a class to lead thru a pre set lesson so its not any type of leadership in the church at all even on a local level. They only deal with like less than an hour of time with the kids on Sunday.\n\nThis does however worryingly bring up questions of why and when were there sleep overs at all. Was it one of his kids that they had sleepovers for and parents figured obviously there should be no issue. Which argues a point that there are consequences to just letting anyone have some kind of role especially over children when theres no application or real interview process or background check. Plus that even non leadership members of the church cant be trusted.\n\nThis doesnt change the fact that churches are prone to, known for, and much more likely than seemingly any other group to take advantage of and abuse minors. Or that I absolutely would love to see christian teachers, youth leaders, or any type of leadership or management role questioned on how we could trust them around our children given their history. Just prefer to be accurate in accusations so they arent then fact checked and used as some kind of proof against claims of immoral and illegal activities because they were just slightly inaccurate. Wouldnt want to be the same as the crazy christian claims they just make up out of nothing like morons.",

It's a very recent development that we've begun to demand much higher expectations of our institutions.\n\nReligions have been guilty of great many things, no doubt, but to insinuate that paedophilia is a problem systemic to the church, rather than one of individuals that churches made the mistake of covering up (largely before child sexual abuse was something society discussed or acknowledged), I think it's wrong.\n\nYou and I may well share many similar political outlooks, but it worries me that the tone of debate is toxic and enflamatory. Its so easy for people to launch angry, ill-thought and insulting posts with little regard to the possibility that it really only serves to feed resentment and suspicion in what is a deeply devisive and damaging culture war. The left has engaged in a race to the bottom and, frankly, should bare its fair share responsibility for helping to create a climate in which a man like Trump is able to be elected leader of the free world. That didn't happen in a vacuum, it happened in a cauldron.\n\nYou slowly, slowly catch the tiger; and certainly not by starting a fight with him...",

It's always \"what about the schools!!!!\" As if that somehow excuses what we see from religious institutions.\n\nFirst, we can worry about both things. The \"left\" has spent the last 3 weeks yelling about safety in schools and the sickening rise of school shootings and how to prevent them and how useless the police officers were and how the system needs to be reformed. So I don't think where this idea that nobody ever talks about schools comes from.\n\nSecond, the vast majority of people support making school officials mandatory reporters of abuse, strict background checks, teaching kids on how to identify and report abuse. And if you have more ideas that should be instituted, I guarantee you nobody in this subreddit will tell you \"how dare you try to make schools safer when there's so much abuse going on in religions institutions.\" People can recognize that you can take care of multiple problems in multiple areas.\n\nThird, this is the athiesm suibreddit, not the education subreddit. Why would you expect people here to concentrate on abuse in schools? Do you think the abuse that goes on in religious institutions is nothing to worry about?\n\nFourth, unlike schools, religious institutions have been dragging their feet an hiding behind their religious rights to oppose being held accountable and prevent any change that would help sex abuse victims.",
