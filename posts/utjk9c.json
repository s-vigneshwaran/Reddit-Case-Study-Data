By airing his pathetic nonsensical rambling, they gave him exactly what he wanted. Now, every time there is a shooting, the asshole has to issue their fuckin \"manifesto\". We don't need to hear that shit. The one and only reason NBC aired that kid's little videos was because they knew it would generate great ratings. I think back then, people thought of news as just that: news. I think, at least more so than these days, people assumed these news channels operated with some sort of integrity and a sense of responsibility. In reality, they operate under the same guideline as a show like Dr. Phil: If we air this, will less people watch our show/network? If the answer is \"no\": air it",

But yea promoting it and airing it on primetime TV like it's something to be excited about is pretty fucked up imo. I'm interested in what the person did, and their reasons. I don't really give a fuck about their name or how they look, and I feel that by giving them the national attention they surely wanted, you're only gonna encourage other ppl to do the same shit. I think most people would agree, but the media gives these individuals attention seemingly every time, proving that it works. Tricky situation",

Phil has had a much larger impact which I think makes him objectively worse. Bumfights guy is also willing to admit this about himself and Phil is not. Imagine having a worse moral compass than the guy that pitted homeless people to wreck each other for like $40. Phil is literally sub-Eric Cartman status lol.\n\n\n\nSorry it just gets me wound up that some people still view the man as a helper when he's the worst kind of opportunistic grifter that society doesn't need at all!",

They had a \"bum hunter\" segment who'd go attack sleeping homeless people and pin them down and tie them up with zip ties while mocking how dirty their appearance is.\n\nLike, anyone who says it's on the same level as Dr Phil definitely has not actually watched Bumfights.

                          "text": "\"Pepe\" is also a \"nazi\" or \"White Power\" meme. But millions and millions of people use it as a regular meme. At the end of the day even racists are humans who go home and laugh at things and use memes themselves. Doesnt make it some Nationalist or racist shit.\n\n\nI read the article and while the word was used in 1999 (which was fucking 23 years ago lol) todays white boy Summer is another Version of the \"hot girl Summer\" meme. Most definitely not the 1999 Version. And I doubt that Chet Hanks is actually racist if you seen his Interviews lmao.",

Versions of the far-right\u2019s dark subversion of the meme have jumped across from the fever swamps of the imageboard 4chan and encrypted messaging service Telegram, to more popular social media apps like TikTok where Bellingcat found one video featuring Nazi iconography that had been viewed more than 10,000 times. \n\n>On Instagram, a number of White Boy Summer memes featuring Nazi motifs were observed coexisting next to more general White Boy Summer content depicting conservative political commentators and other popular figures who have a more mainstream profile. \n\n>The fact these two types of content can be found in the same spaces suggests the term has the potential to draw in more moderate right-wing users who can then be exposed to radical and extremist propaganda.",

Phill may make light of really horrible and toxic situations in the name of daytime entertainment, but at least all he was asking them do is share their stories in an overdramatic fashion.

          "text": "I mean, his show is incredibly exploitative. He has people with mental issues on and doesn't really help them in any way. They're just a spectacle for his audience, and for him to profit off of. Not to mention 99% of the time his advice is for people to basically \"stop being lazy\" and get a job when that doesn't really get to the root of the issue (for example, a guy with clear bi polar symptoms which were blatantly ignored in favor of the usual \"this is America, get a job\" narrative. The guy had severe issues, getting a job wouldn't magically solve all that). \n\nOne of the most fucked up incidences in my opinion was when he had a young woman with some kind of delusional disorder on the show. He was going through the bullet points on the screen of the times she was sexually assaulted and it honestly felt surreal. Where's the empathy just matter of factly going through a timeline of this woman's abuse? He made a comment about how she might live in \"a fantasy land\" but he doesn't. What kind of \"doctor\" says that to someone with mental health issues?? He invited her mother to the show when the guest was told she wouldn't be there. She caught onto the fact that she was a spectacle for his audience and emotionally said she would take that role, to which he promptly kicked her off the show, citing he would invite whatever guests he wanted. Pretty obvious he didn't like the fact that that guest gave everyone a reality check about the nature of the show. There was no other reason to suddenly kick her off like that.\n\nAnother questionable incident that springs to mind: having a guy on who bulgeoned his mother to death with a mallet and asking extreeemely distaseful and unnecessary questions, like what sound it made hitting her skull. Again, extremely exploitive and unnecessary.\n\nOn top of that, the ranch his show regularly sent \"troubled teens\" to came under fire for being abusive. The show clearly endorsed the ranch, yet suddenly Phil said what happens at the ranch isn't his responsibility and he doesn't know about it. You would think they would have these places vetted but apparently not? Or more disturbingly he may have known what was happening but looked the other way. I'm also pretty sure his license expired years ago, so he's not really in a place to be giving this kind of advice (which is pretty clear, seeing any segment of the show).",

The man paid homeless people pocket change to let them fight, pick out their teeth and other degrating and damaging things to their health, while making a shit ton of money out of the video clips. \n\nMerely presenting a amusing sketch to poke fun at the hypocricy of dr phil doesn\u2019t change that this guy is a piece of shit.\n\nEdit: And no dr phil did not, I think, kick him out because he felt insecure or thought he was right. He saw the video of what this guy did/does and kicked him out after that (for shock value and this was obviously pre-planned, but still) .\nPeople tend to dislike hypocrits a lot more then people who are downright evil but are not afraid to admit it.

His guests are fully 100% aware of what Phil is about. They choose to fly to wherever the show is taped. They choose to travel to the studio. And they choose to be on camera to get attention for whatever their issue is. Does Phil exploit them? Sure. But every single guest serves themselves up to him knowing what is going on. None of them are victims of his. \n\nThis other piece of shit is a predator. He picks on helpless homeless people who are hungry and have no shelter. He dangles money in front of them and promises to give it to them if they fight on video. If these people weren\u2019t hungry or cold from exposure they probably wouldn\u2019t participate. But when you\u2019re hungry, and I mean really truly hungry, you will do almost anything in order to be able to eat. He hunts them down and takes advantage of them. It\u2019s exploitation on a completely different level.",

The guy doesn't drive had he used up enough energy to buy his food and take a bus home, then you start following the guy all the way down to harass him about not putting away a cart so he can make two trips walking up and down with the heavy groceries in his hands? thats not right.",

He has audience trust.  This Bum Fights guy doesn't; especially because they don't know who he is. \n\nBFg just suddenly threw on a suit, saved his head, and said 'you and I aren't so different'.  Maybe he's right but he establishes no argument so who are they gonna be persuaded by?  Dr. Phil who they have learned to trust?  Or Bum Fights guy?  \n\nWhat matters socially more than truth is how the truth is perceived by the audience. \n\nIt's why people were on Phil McGraw's side even when he is exploiting mentally ill people for the sake of his show. They \"know\" Phil via parasocial relationship.  They don't \"know\" this guy at all. It's whybwhen he defended the integrity of his show, the audience who have been with him, agreed and defended him..",
