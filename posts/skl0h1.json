Big meaty sausage fingers and large hands are great for tossing around hay bales and calving  but I'm skeptical of your definition of playing. I'm guessing your idea of playing is along the lines of how a 5 year old would play the flute... yeah you blow into it make sounds but  it's not remotely close to music.\n\nI visited Russia once and I ended up in this very poor Russian town out in the country , cant remember the name but it was very poor, it was like the town was cut off from the rest of the world and in the middle of a famine, dirty, no food, no luxury nothing absolute poverty where people barely had clothing.  I saw the exact same sweater you were wearing outside a thrift shop with a sign that said  \" Take this sweater if you need it\"  Apparently people who had nothing still did not want that sweater, hell the thrift shop didnt even want it taking up space inside.....  some people were wearing potato  sacks and still they didnt want that very same sweater that you were wearing. Even homeless people draw the line..",
