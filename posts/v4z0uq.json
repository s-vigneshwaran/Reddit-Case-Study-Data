For example my 6th grade year some girl got a train ran on her then claimed rape when they caught her. In 11th grade girl was getting fucked in a empty room and hot caught and claimed rape afterwards. Even met a 30 year old drunkard lady on psn. She also hit a guy with a case fucking after leaving a bar with her and smashing. But he drank way more than her. We get held responsible for drunk driving but if she sleeps with someone while she is drunk she cant be held responsible? Imo thats a false case too so at this point my gut reaction is to think she capping.",
