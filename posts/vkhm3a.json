You can be anti or pro abortion if you take the Bible as your guideline so you can on so many many numerous topics.\n\nSo it's fighting an up hill battle if you would discuss this with someone that's also using the Bible for arguments of pro abortion. \n\nMaybe, just maybe, we shouldn't let an ancient old book with outdated laws and morals dictate our lives.

It's generally something chosen by the woman herself, in this case, just like any other Bible passage it's the husband, or men society that will dictate it for the woman.\n\nI guess I see the \"choose it yourself\" as the \"abortion\" option. This water test thingy seems more like a cruel thing. Just like you said \"witch hunting\".\n\nSo according to this passage I would still not believe \"god\" is in favor of abortion.\n\nAnother reply said they thought very little of fetus and unborn childs. So that could also be indicative of \"pro abortion\"\n\nIn any case I think it's a vague area, you can interpret as such. My point is, let's forget about this vagueness and just get to the point with clear common sense morals which are based on the current era we live in. \n\nI would have never guessed we would have a progressive country going back on something that seems like a basic human right to me.

God had no problems with the unborn dying by the bitter water test (a silly, non-scientific method to test for infidelity). And furthermore, a man that beats a pregnant woman causing miscarriage is only guilty of a *property crime*, as his penalty is merely monetary. But if the woman dies, he must pay with his life. Even their almighty sky ghost does not consider an unborn fetus a person. \n\nEven ISLAM allows for abortion in certain circumstances, my brother in christ. We are heading to Gilead. Get your red robes and bonnets, ladies because we are past the \u201cslippery slope.\u201d We are moving by sheer inertia now, and no amount of voting can serve as a brake or rudder. \n\nThe fact is, this has been the plan for DECADES by the christo-fascist right, but it just happened about 20 years before Jerry Falwell had predicted it would. Trump squeaked out a popular vote loss election win in 2016, 100% borne out of the Hilary Clinton campaign\u2019s hubris. And by the machinations of a corrupt senate (Mitch McConnell specifically), after stealing a Supreme Court pick from Obama AND one from Biden, we arrived at their destination by sheer evil happenstance. And there\u2019s little we can do about it. vOtE hArDeR and OrGaNiZe HaRdEr isn\u2019t going to get us out of this mess. \n\nAnd the right wants nothing more than for the left to start chucking Molotov cocktails and rioting because they feel like it will get Trump off the hook. And he still might, no matter what we do. \n\nThat shit might have worked if the Roe decision hadn\u2019t been leaked. Conservative or liberal, the leaker is an American hero, because I sincerely believe that if at this very moment, the Roe decision hit without warning, even the most pacifist leftists would have FLIPPED SHIT and walked into their trap.",

In other other Muslim countries it is heavily regulated, only in the case of saving the life of the mother. It's also very taboo and happens very infrequently.  \n\nFuck this decision by SCROTUS, but we're not a theocracy, yet. There is no Provence in Iraq you can get an abortion, along with 25 other countries. Can't say the same for the US. Some of you are allowing your emotions to get the best of you. Just look at the map in the article I posted, then rethink op. Let's leave the hyperbole for the fascist.",

But is that what the US does? No. So saying \"hey the Bible says to treat foreigners well so don't look at the us when discussing how horrible people from central America are treated\" doesn't quite wash.\n\nYall are mincing words like only religious people can. The fact remains that op is a lying hypocrit. And the people in this thread comparing the US to sharia is fucking stupid.",

Homosexuality is illegal in almost every muslim country, and its punishable by death in several (the ones that practise Sharia law), imprisonment in many more. Blasphemy (which extends to just about any criticism of the religion) is illegal and punishable by death (people merely accused of blasphemy are routinely lynched across the Muslim world), apostasy is illegal and punishable by death. A mere portrayal of the prophet is enough to trigger riots across the muslim world and get people killed, acknowledging the prophet a pedophile (which he was, Aisha was 6 when married, raped at 9) will trigger international protests and a diplomatic incident against the truth. Honour killings are an all too common practise. Women are subserviated, treated as objects of sexual temptation (forced to cover up in dozens of muslim countries), marital rape is legalised, men hitting their wives is condoned. The christian right being worse on the issue of abortion doesn't remotely bring it near the intolerance and violence and oppression of fundamentalist Islam. \"Liberals\" need to stop the apologetics for such a far-right religion.",

It is important to note, however, that this ruling applies only to Muslims, and I don\u2019t have enough knowledge to say how sharia would apply these rulings to non-Muslims, since certain rules in Islamic jurisprudence do not apply to non-Muslims. \n\nThough, again, no Muslim-majority country actually implements sharia, so you\u2019d probably be hard-pressed to find a country that had any issue with PDA, unless you went to a country that is currently controlled by religious extremists such as ISIS\u2014though these extremist groups *definitely* don\u2019t follow anything close to sharia (instead implementing a very warped and incorrect view of Islamic rulings), so all bets are off.\n\nIf you have any specific questions, I\u2019d be happy to do my best to answer them :)",

          "text": "This is a common misconception because most (all) Muslim-majority countries do not implement sharia. Sharia actually sets forth lots of rights for women, almost all of which were unheard of prior to Islam. I\u2019ll link a few articles at the end of this comment, but here\u2019s a quick rundown on what Islam *actually* says:\n\n* Islam holds that men and women are equal in the eyes of god. \n* Both husband and wife are able to divorce, and women to not need to state a specific reason for divorce.\n* When getting married, the man is required to give the woman a gift of her choosing as a mehr (dowry). Unlike the traditional dowry, where the woman\u2019s family gives some amount of money to the man to use to support his wife, the bride can use her mehr however she sees fit. This serves to both ensure that the husband is adequately prepared to financially support his new wife and to provide financial protection to the bride in the case of the husband\u2019s death, divorce, etc.\n* In a marriage, Islam holds that the husband is required to provide his wife with food, clothing, and money to spend as she pleases. Additionally, money that the husband has given to the wife or money that the wife has earned are both considered to be the wife\u2019s entirely. The common Muslim saying in this regard is \u201cwhat\u2019s his is hers and what\u2019s hers is hers\u201d.\n* Women are empowered to work or start businesses, and as above, any money she earns from these enterprises are hers entirely, to do with as she pleases.\n* Islam gives women the right to be involved in politics. In other words, Muslim women have the right to vote.\n* In a Muslim marriage, the wife has the freedom to choose her place of residence. In other words, when searching for a home, the wife gets the final say.\n* Inheritance can be a \u201cgotcha\u201d point made by Islamophobes, since the female members of a family generally receive less than the males. However, the male members of the family are required to financially support the family, whereas the female members of the family are under no such obligation.\n* Women are not only allowed to seek out education, but are encouraged to. In fact, Al-Qarawiyyin, the oldest university in the world, was founded by a Muslim woman\u2014Fatima al-Fihri\u2014in the 9th century. \n* While men are *allowed* to marry up to four wives in Islamic law, the husband is obligated to treat each of them equally. Because of the difficulty in actually treating each wife perfectly equally, marrying more than one wife is discouraged. Additionally, the wife is fully within her right to disallow other marriages.\n\n[Link 1](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=96850)\n[Link 2](https://www.stylist.co.uk/visible-women/fatima-al-fihri-founder-world-first-known-university-this-weeks-issue-430/224181)\n[Link 3](https://legaljournal.princeton.edu/the-gender-dichotomy-how-sharia-law-in-the-seventh-century-granted-women-legal-empowerment/)\n[Link 4](https://legaljournal.princeton.edu/the-gender-dichotomy-how-sharia-law-in-the-seventh-century-granted-women-legal-empowerment/)\n[Link 4](https://onwardforafghanwomen.org/policy/girls-education-and-islam-a-divine-command-with-historical-precedent/)\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask and I\u2019ll do my best to answer them :)",

It's not a punchline. It's a very serious comparison that is painfully appropriate and if you don't understand WHY it's appropriate, you're either ignoring the nature of religious law in general, or you're directly part of the problem. \n\nPeople saying \"but Sharia allows for abortions\" are COMPLETELY missing the point.
