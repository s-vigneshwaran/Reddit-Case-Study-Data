  "text": "TIFU by letting family back into my life, unaware that I had won the lottery years prior\nSo backstory. I, (36M) am the youngest of 5 children (boy-girl-boy-girl-boy) and we grew up in absolute poverty. Mom loved having kids but she didn't work and dad didn't make enough to support everyone. Poor enough that I remember as an 11 or 12 year old receiving a single plastic slinky and being absolutely thrilled I got anything.\n\nGrowing up with that kind of family was rough, parents got divorced and dad lived locally but didn't really do much to try to be a dad. Just support financially when legally necessary, and he let it slip once to me that he never wanted any kids. He just loved my mom and she wanted kids so he went along with it. Obviously with this kind of dynamic and the absolute lack of resources, home life wasn't great prior to the divorce.\n\nI was helping fix drywall at like 5 years old because we could only afford to live in crumby run down houses. I remember stripping paint with a steamer and putty knife at about 6 or 7 and only learned recently that the house had lead paint. Oldest siblings did even more housework and probably inhaled a bunch of lead dust and toxic substances. Couple that with the emotional abuse of our parents and they didn't grow up to be good people.\n\nMy oldest brother had anger issues and got kicked out of college for fighting people. He also got arrested a few times for stuff involving theft or violence. Oldest sister struggled with substance abuse, got arrested a few times, ended up involuntarily committed for 72hrs once. She's doing a lot better nowadays but still an unpleasant person. Next brother went on to just be an employee at a large chain store where I think he might be a manager now. All 3 still live in the impoverished town we grew up in.\n\nMy next sister and I are close enough in age that we're very similar. Both joined the military to escape the poverty trap of our hometown. I joined the Army and she went Navy, even at about the same time. While in the service, we both pieced together a bunch of things about  our siblings and parents that made everything clear. It was like we both had half of a connect-the-dots puzzle that made no sense, and when put together the outcome was a big sign that said \"EVERYONE IN THIS FAMILY IS AWFUL.\"\n\nShe confronted them about it after her contract ended and got kind of dragged into the drama all over again. She moved to a city near the hometown (about 1 hour away) and started working there right away. I cut everyone else out of my life. I hadn't spoken to most of them in years, and the others are cursory and obligatory in nature.\n\nAfter my contract ended I started college using the GI Bill which not only paid for my tuition, but also paid a monthly housing stipend so I can focus on school. My family fucking HATED that I was basically getting free school to them. Couldn't explain that it meant giving up 4 years of my life for active duty and I have to drill every month in the reserves, and part of my body is permanently wrecked; to them it is an unfair advantage. While in school, I had a habit of buying a lottery ticket every month when the GI Bill hit my account. It was borderline superstitious as I never had any notion of winning because I remember a statistic once that said men in California have a higher chance at actually being Brad Pitt than winning the lottery.\n\nMy final semester I won. I didn't win Fuck-You money by any means. I won the type of money where you could pay cash for a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house with .36 acres in a county where housing prices were below the national average and then have nothing left. Yes it's specific because that's what I did. I never told any family, including my cool older sister because as much as I love her she would almost be obligated to tell the rest of them. The purchase of that home happened when I was 25, so 11 years ago. Since then I got married and had a kid and have an all around nice and pleasant life.\n\nAbout a year ago, oldest sister was going to be near where I lived (several time zones away from family) for work and she wanted to visit me so she could meet my daughter and catch up. Against better judgment, I agreed because my wife wanted to know more about my family who she had never met.\n\nSo sister was staying with us for 3 days before she had to go do her work stuff and spent the whole time just reminiscing and catching up. At one point during dinner on the 2nd night she asked about what my mortgage must be like, since she paid $900 in rent for something much smaller and with no yard. My wife scoffed briefly, unaware that my family didn't know of my financial windfall.\n\nSister, though a troubled individual, is no dummy and picked up on that. Her tone shifted from casual to serious and asked \"What does that mean?\"\n\nI am not great at lying, improv, or doing anything without excess planning. I sat stupified while trying to figure out what to say before my wife said \"Well he used his winnings to just buy the house.\"\n\nThus setting off the chain reaction of questions that culminated with sister finding out I made 6 digits for free while \"attending college for free\" and \"getting rent paid while not doing any fucking work.\" She was absolutely livid and left for a hotel.\n\nAbout 2 hours later the phone calls began from every member of my family accusing me of cutting them off so I wouldn't have to share this gift from god. The sister I got along with even got angry at me for keeping it a secret, but she understood that it would have put her in a bad position of lying to family. My phone, email, and wife's phone began blowing up for the next week while family tried to get money from me not understanding that there wasn't any left. They kept saying that they're about to file for bankruptcy because of debt and I could save the family but I'm just being selfish.\n\nAfter a week, lawyers got involved because my family started threatening to sue me for damages for everything wrong in our family (they eventually did file). Every single thing that could even remotely justify going to small claims court or a full lawsuit was brought up. They even added up an estimated amount of gas money I borrowed since starting to drive at 16 with verbal agreements to \"pay you back later\" taking into account inflation and current gas prices. Everything together they asked for would have just been short of buying another house in cash.\n\nI'm able to post this now because I was able to get about 90% of it dropped for being absolutely ridiculous, and showing that a lot of their claims occurred during a time when I had no contact with them (thank you phone and email records). The remaining 10% of what they wanted was stuff that happened when I was 17 or 18, like denting one of their cars or injuring them when I threw an empty beer bottle during a fight and leaving a permanent scar where the glass cut them.\n\nAfter lawyer and court fees plus paying damages, I lost a bit more than $10k to family. The stress from the legal battle affected me at work and when it got out I was being sued by family after winning a lottery, all my coworkers began asking for help financially. It got bad enough (people coming to my home at night) that I had to request a transfer to a different branch where nobody knew me. Now I'm having to sell the home I bought, where my daughter was growing up in, and move to a more expensive city where the other branch is. All because I let my family back into my life\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: grew up poor, family sucked, joined military to escape poverty, found out family sucked even more than previously thought, went to college, basically won a house in the lottery, never told family, a decade later family found out, they sued me for every single thing they thought they could, I lost $10k due to fees, had to leave my job and move to a bigger city, all because my family sucks.\n\nMoral of the story: Don't let family back in",

Suddenly he was telling me about how his friend was out of work and might not make this months mortgage payment, his dad needed a holiday but train tickets were extortionate\u2026\n\nHe was furious that the loan in MY NAME that only I was repaying didn\u2019t end up in his pocket. Every month when I had money to spend on myself he would try a \u00a3 redirect i5 to himself somehow. \n\nHe also pocketed the deposit I had paid for our rental, tried to leave me to pay HIS utility bills and he owed me \u00a3100 a month for a direct debit I\u2019d let him set up from my account which he never paid on time, leaving me stuck with overdraft fees. \n\nSome people just spend and spend until they run out and instead of thinking \u2018wow, how can I prevent this happening again?\u2019 they just start grasping at what everyone else has \n\nI\u2019m not even well-off. I worked shitty hours, bought most of our groceries and he earned \u00a3300+ more than me a month: our bills were a 50/50 split. \n\nI finally blocked him a few years back when I bought my first home (a real fixer upper) and he slid into my DM\u2019s asking me how I could afford it. I said I\u2019d lived with parents for 9x months to save the deposit up and my job more than covered the small mortgage. \nWithin seconds he was asking if I\u2019d bought it as Buy to Let and was sending me links to Buzzfeed articles about tenants who renovate properties for rent breaks etc etc\u2026 essentially ground work for suggesting I stay living with my parents (in their house. At 34 years old.) and quit my job to just\u2026hang around collecting rent from tenants. Only I wouldn\u2019t be as of course my unskilled tenants would be undertaking all the renovation work at their own cost. And he and his fianc\u00e9 were looking for somewhere to rent, with the aim to buy it after a few years. What an offer! /s",

You have to act on probabilistic reasoning; you make what you think are good bets. \"I bet if I do this, something good will happen!\"\n\nIn short, you have to use heuristics.

I had a roommate and we got tickets together and he started getting really serious about asking \"If you win the lottery, how much would you give me?\" I said like $10 grand or something just to throw a number out there and he legit got upset saying it was such a measly amount and treated me differently afterwards. We had a legit argument for like thirty minutes about a hypothetical situation. Like how is he owed something just because I know him and he'd know I won? By proxy he thinks he's getting half or what? We literally had just met a few weeks prior. Just to give an example of how people act. Personally I didn't ask them that because I would expect them to just take the money and run because that's what anyone should do.\n\nIf you play, don't play with others knowing you got a ticket. Don't tell them you won. Immediately seek out a lawyer and have them claim the money for you anonymously if it's a large amount and then disappear. If you have an SO, they better be someone you can trust or there's a divorce in the cards because even SOs can act irrationally with large sums.\n\nI get that you want to see the good in people and most people are good under regular circumstances. But if they're hurting for money even a little and see the possibility of that going away, some people are truly shameless. As others have mentioned, some people have even ended up dead. There are stories of people breaking into lotto winners homes to try and steal their money and yes even murder by someone they knew.",

That's on him. Even if he didn't originally know not to tell randos/coworkers prior to his wife's mistake, he should have learned from her mistake and come to the conclusion that no good comes from talking about winning the lottery with anyone. That was the lesson, he should have learned from it. He experienced the fallout firsthand, he's an adult, he shouldn't need to also have been the cause of the fallout to learn from it. \n\nA good baseline is that adults need to know how to learn from the experiences of others, and not exclusively rely on learning from their own personal mistakes.",

Its astonishing to me that there isn't a check in place to cap litigation costs for each individual case and/or being dismissed on the outset if the expected litigation cost far exceeds the amount of alleged damages. Or at the very least, increase small claims court cap to  more like $50k and let people yell it out in front of a judge with no lawyers and few rules. I remember a news story 10 or 15 years ago about a lady who won her case for like $100k and only got $1 after her legal fees, its sickening how the \"justice\" system works.",

This clause is basically ignored today for obvious reasons, but it shows  the founding fathers considered the cost of holding a trial to be less important than justice - convening a jury was always understood to be burdensome to the juryists and considered a civic duty because of the burden.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution#:~:text=The%20Seventh%20Amendment%20(Amendment%20VII,a%20jury's%20findings%20of%20fact.\n\nThey fought for this explicitly because they had experienced not having jury trials.

My issue still stands, that someone not profiting from misdeeds is good for society (I agree), but my issue starts when all or most profit from a misdeed being funneled to attorney income and not making a vicitm whole. Same goes the other way, an attorney should not be entitled to payment if they file frivolous lawsuits on behalf of their clients, or suits that are exaggerated, when they really should be argued in small claims. I could hire an attorney to sue some entity for $100,000 and that attorney eventually offers and agreed to settle for $10,000, that attorney shouldn't be allowed to collect anything, and I should be on the hook for any legal fees incurred by the other party that wouldn't have occurred if it was filed in small claims. Yet, this happens all day, every day in America. Only attorneys are making money on usually legally baseless arguments in the hopes of profiting from a settlement. Eeveryone else loses and rarely gets their case decided by a court, as it doesn't make sense to pay a lawyer another $15k to defend yourself from a frivolous lawsuit when you can settle for $13k. Its hard to imagine a more clear racket.",

It shouldn't be how much your attorney is willing to give you if you win and demand payment for a lost case for as much as a won case. The only people that win in every case are attorneys. I gave just a few examples, without much thought, on how that could be simply remedied to make civil cases more fair to all parties. Criminal cases, I dont really care how much someone spends on defense, as long as the prosecutor is trying cases they can win and have overwhelming evidence to attempt to take someone's freedom or property.",

According to my family, I am \u201crich\u201d because I was in a vehicle accident that left me a navel down paraplegic with several severe health problems and received a very large settlement. \n\nOnly one of them visited during my recovery process. But as soon as I was \u201crecovered\u201d enough to leave a hospital, they all started calling asking if they could get some of the \u201csettlement money\u201d.  I politely responded that I had not received it yet and \u201cpromised\u201d I would let them know as soon as I did. And promptly blocked every one of them that asked. They showed up at my house about 4 months later, while my good friend Tim was building wheelchair ramps for me to use. Not one offer of help. So I made them stay at a hotel. They got the hint pretty quickly for being stupid people.\n\nMy wife was shocked at how downright petty I was being at first, until she saw what was happening. Then she said to me seriously \u201cyour family are bad people\u201d. \n\n17 years later and I only speak to my older brother. The only one who has never asked me for \u201csettlement money\u201d and came to help rebuild my roof the next year for free. Genuinely nice guy, and I love him dearly. Also the only one who visited to see me during recovery.\n\nEdit: this isn\u2019t entirely true. My sister is alright too. We don\u2019t speak as much but we do talk often enough for me to know she isn\u2019t entirely a piece of shit.",

If lawyers and court was free, then It would have been like $2.5k they won. The judge dismissed so many claims that brought the demanded amount from 6 digits to just 4. And then only ruled in their favor about things that had tangible evidence (like the scar). At that point my lawyer and I discussed that it would probably cost more to fight those claims than to just pay them.\n\nImagine having a family member that won money, then after not getting any you sue them and deal with legal procedures for over a year (granted, it's not like you go to court every day or week) just to get $2500 that you split between 5 people total (two parents and three siblings. Cool sister didn't sue). That's like $500 a person.\n\nThat's how I look at this. They collectively agree and sold me as a family member for $500 each.\n\nOr I paid $10,000 to never deal with the 5 worst people I've ever met in my life.",

Like there's a pretty infamous judge working in claims (or whatever the department that handles work related insurance claims is called) in my city that rules heavily in favor of the company in disability claims cases. Like my own dad had a pretty cut and dry disabilities claim that would have netted him something like $20,000 if ruled in his favor. Like it was pretty clear and obvious that the claim was valid but my parents lawyer basically told them they were going to lose because the judge overseeing the claim was infamous for ruling in favor of the company. Something like 95% last I heard. So in cases where the judge can make the decision, the outcome can vary depending on who the judge is.",

Monday comes and he gives me $550 then by wednesday he asked for $600 and promised $800..\n\nThen it turned into \"they halted his unemployment\" and he asked for another $400 and promised a grand..2 weeks go by and i called my mom and she told me hes been getting his unemployment like normal. I confronted him and he didnt care and my mom just defended him because he said he paid me.\n\nI had my 2nd kid and they were begging to come over and i just ignored the txts, then found out my sister blocked them and moved and my brother also blocked them both and moved..\n\nI talked to my sister for the first time in a decade and she said my dad got drunk and went on a racist rant because her husband is black and their kid is half black.\n\nHe took a blowtorch to my mom aswell to she stayed with him for some reason..they tried so hard to guilt trip me into letting them visit aswell.\n\nTrust me dude dont let them back into ur life its not worth it",

And we still had to pay property taxes so it wasn't like we lived completely free of bills, so the knowledge of not paying mortgage isn't always on my mind. Like, it's easier to see when something is there than to see that something isn't there. Since there wasn't any money left over, the only difference in my life and my sister's was that I didn't pay rent/mortgage. I just hadn't thought about telling my wife.\n\nOur relationship is still solid. Strained due to circumstances but not because of resentment or anything. Once we're settled again it'll be fine. I couldn't reasonably be mad at her for not knowing what I didn't tell her. \n\nMy cool sister is still in my life because she didn't sue. She was a character witness in my defense stating that some of the actions family claimed I did would have been well outside of what I'm capable of. She asked once if any money was left, and when I said no then she never asked about it again. Her job pays pretty well so she isn't in debt. The Navy really helped set her up for a good career.\n\nEveryone else has a No Contact Order against them. They can't talk to me, my wife, or my daughter ever again. Parents tried to fight that citing Grandparental Rights, but that was dismissed. They have one less grandchild now.",

She rotates through the people in her life regularly.  So, this is my 2nd turn of being cut off and I expect when the next person pisses her off she'll reach out to me.\n\nBut I'm not playing the game this time.  I did once, I won't again.\n\nBut I miss my grandson, he's my only biological grandson though I've an infant stepson I adore.  \n\nSo, I've thought hard about asserting grandparents rights.  But I don't want to hurt that child, I don't see how I can without potentially hurting him via her.\n\n\ud83d\ude25\n\nI'd give anything to see him, I'm within a couple of blocks of him regularly.

Ultimately as a society we *have* to give parents far more rights to parent their kids, than other family members.  Otherwise families become an impossible tangle of legal obligations between married parents, divorced parents, grandparents, and so on.  And in my opinion, there would be far too many situations where grandparents would use those rights to try and enforce social values from three generations ago on kids who have to live in 2022.\n\nAlso, I don't know you from Adam.  **Nobody's the bad guy in their own story.**  For all I know, you're the mom of somebody posting in /r/raisedbynarcissists, who \"doesn't understand\" why she doesn't get to see her grandkids after a lifetime of abusive behavior.

That's because now she has her new boyfriend's family to take it's place.\n\nThe father of her son's family is most often on her \"I'm not talking to you\" list.  Her father and his family are also most frequently on that list.\n\nAs soon as this new family does something that offends her she'll reach out to me and this side of her family to \"make up\" as then it'll be their turn.\n\nShe's done this rotation for years.  Everyone outside of her can see the pattern, but she can't.  The new people can't either, yet.\n\nBut she upped her game this time to include access to my grandson by anyone.  He has little cousins who have been asking to see him, one little 6 year old boy literally begging for his cousin as he's the only other boy.  The rest are girls.\n\nThat won't be easily forgiven by her aunt's and uncle's and cousins.  \n\nShe can't have more children and I believe that her brother having a baby and that being celebrated is what set her off this time.  I know it hurt her.  \n\nIt's devastating for her to not be able to have more children.  It broke her when she lost the baby and was told don't ever try again as it'll kill both her and the baby.  There's nothing they can do about it medically and they can't afford surrogacy or adoption.\n\nMy poor girl, this breaks my heart.  So I understand, but it hurts my heart to not see my grandson.",

His money made other men look inferior, they said, wherever he went in the small West Virginia town he called home. Resentment grew quickly. And festered. Whittaker paid four settlements related to this sort of claim. Yes, you read that right. Four.\n\n>Her seventeen year old boyfriend had expired three months earlier in Whittaker's vacation house, also from an overdose. Some of his friends had robbed the house after his overdose, stepping over his body to make their escape and then returning for more before stepping over his body again to leave. His parents sued for wrongful death claiming that Whittaker's loose purse strings contributed to their son's death. Amazingly, juries are prone to award damages in cases such as these. Whittaker settled. Again.\n\n>You are going to get advice that is badly tainted by conflict of interest, and if other family members find out that Aunt Flo was consulted and they weren't you will never hear the end of it. Neither will Aunt Flo. This might later form the basis for an allegation that Aunt Flo unduly influenced you and a lawsuit might magically appear on this basis. No, I'm not kidding. I know of one circumstance (related to a business windfall, not a lottery) where the plaintiffs WON this case.\n\nJust the FRIVOLOUS fucking lawsuits. Fucking losing a lawsuit because you consulted one family member about your winnings but no the other?! HOW THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THAT A LEGAL ISSUE. IT'S NOT THEIR FUCKING MONEY. Why the FUCK does a court get to say 'you should have consulted with this other family member about your money therefore you owe them money'?!\n\nIf that shit happened to me I'd have NO MONEY because I'd do everything in my power to murder everyone involved in that legal proceeding.",

In most states you lose by default if your claim is older than six years (or less) for most debts. You said you're 36 now and the claims that were upheld were from when you were 17-18? Either there's a statute of limitations or the doctrine of laches would preclude a successful claim, you just file a motion to dismiss at the initial appearance. (Or maybe it's summary judgment, I'm a law nerd not a lawyer)\n\nYour story is exactly why experts say you shouldn't even give the lottery your real name when you win. All kinds of toxic people come out of the woodwork when they think you have \"free money\".\n\nEdit: others have helpfully pointed out that the claims are not only too old to be valid, but OP was a minor at the time so there's no way the judge could have found in favor of the family on those counts. It certainly shouldn't have taken $7500 in legal fees and $2500 in settlements to get this case dismissed.",

Their lawyer argued that a lawsuit demanding financial recoupment for the family, and any conversations made prior to the suit being filed, was not enough to constitute any sort of emotional damages. They didn't make any threats and all they did was call my and my wife a lot. How I handled a lawsuit emotionally was out of their control.\n\nRegarding my work life, according to their lawyer, it was my fault my performance at work decreased and lead to that other situation. And anything coworkers did had nothing to do with my family since they didn't actively tell anyone to harass me.",

Aside from a couple outliers, most states statutes of limitations are <=6yrs and the max is 10 for an informal loan or property damage. You bought the house 11 years ago and had already long cut off contact. Something doesn't add up here...\n\n>all my coworkers began asking for help financially\n\nOP, I get the impression you're the type that has a hard time getting rid of door to door solicitors and telemarketers. If I won the lottery, even an enormous jackpot, or even was simply very well-off, and even a single coworker thought it was even a little bit ok to come begging for money, they would be left with no uncertainty where they could stuff their feelings.",

And it was scratched to shit. Completely destroyed. So I confronted my parents as they had no business touching my radio at all. They lied to me and told me that it was already there and they never touched it. So I asked them if a ghost must\u2019ve done it because it\u2019s been in my CD player for 4 years. They said yea a ghost must\u2019ve done it because it\u2019s impossible to be them. 2 things. I own two vehicles and I don\u2019t use my truck but every once in a while. And before they borrowed it I drove it once the week before and made a mental note of listening to the same cd for 4 years. I knew they did it but they refused to admit it like a little child. I always knew my parents were manipulative and evil but holy shit it was just a CD. But I don\u2019t think they would pull this kind of shit on me. If my mother tried to sue me I would stomp her into the ground. \n\nI ended up getting really pissed and blew up on my parents. I was 27 and they just lied to my face over a CD. My mother ended up calling the police on me. Which was the straw that broke the camels back for me. She\u2019s dead to me now and I\u2019m going to put her in a nursing home and sell everything she owns one day. Also hope she goes senile so I never have to deal with her ever again. \n\nI feel sorry for you man. You\u2019re family is much worse then mine and I thought mine was bad.",

But since then, I've seen the fallout from when my father's parents and some other extended family members died.\n\n You should note the claim made to the OP was that they were about to go bankrupt... Specifically, if we grant the benefit of the doubt as to the veracity of his statement (ie. He's explaining what he believes to be true and is not deliberately lying), the family was claiming such things. The distinction between \"they claimed\" and \"they were\" is a rather non-ignorable one and it's a rather easy point of misinterpretation to conflate both statements of fact as the same thing when one is a local fact (ie. I believe X) and the other is a global fact (ie. X is true) \n\nScumbags can claim a lot of things, as can conmen and other swindlers, when they think there's still a chance they can guilt trip you out of something... And when they're convinced you have something worth taking, they'll find any and every way to pry things from your hands.\n\n I never expected to have extended family that would be the sort to clean out all the jewelry, cash, and other easily fenced--er, pawned goods while everyone else was at the funeral... And I never expected to see someone stick their \"significant other\" in the lowest cost nursing home they could find when my uncle developed dementia so she could siphon off every dime possible before he died, either.  Yet in both cases, I did, and it opened my eyes to just how shitty people can be... and that's without including my experience of watching one of my shipmates when I was in the Navy get sued for abandonment (during the divorce) by his ex after she literally cleaned out their rental *and* their joint bank account while we were at sea for a 2-week workup.  When I say cleaned out, she took literally everything, including his uniforms, all the way down to taking the ice tray out of the fridge that came with the unit along with the toilet paper rolls.\n\nPeople are, by and large, shit. Having an overly optimistic view of them because you haven't seen someone get fucked isn't exactly a life-enhancing policy, as is dismissing someone's story offhand, apparently due to the combination of excessive optimism and lack of analytical rigor.  \n\nThere are a few questionable points, but what you pointed out isn't one of them. That said, the style and tone fit well enough that, barring direct proof to the contrary, I'm willing to give OP benefit of the doubt. It's not like he's asking for money, and it's not like I'm dumb enough to give it to him. It is a post on the internet, after all, and some minimum amount of skepticism still applies.",

Not necessarily because \"That's all we can afford\", but because it's what we decided we can afford without having decades worth of debt and because we are content with a simpler lifestyle. That said, it has needed work which we've been doing. I've, over the time, actively encouraged our kids to help out while teaching them things like about using tools and such. Your comment about doing that sort of work as a kid sent a chill down my spine and suddenly I'm like \"Shit... Is that how they'll feel later on life? Is this something I should expect or prepare for? Is there anything I can do as a father so that they don't later have any sort of negative view on the experience or possible resentment towards us?

Rehab, being inclusive and open, supporting, etc., nothing ever helped. He also has a daughter that he can never see since he refuses to provide the court proof of a job and clean drug tests. \n\nMy wife also has a brother arguably worse than mine, and her whole family is poverty stricken and is garbage. \n\nThen I have a younger brother that I will lay my life to defend, we\u2019ve been close since children, and we\u2019re close as parents today, chatting every other day. \n\nSo essentially, our parents were super wealthy, but my brother and I were well into our careers with our wives, so we were also comfortable with our lives. Upon my parents passing, we inherited their assets, and they basically left my older brother a few items like select furniture that was basically worthless, but they divided the vast majority of their assets between myself, my younger brother, and my older brother\u2019s daughter. They adored her and took her all over the world when she was a baby to young child. They thought she was deserving of their fortune and not their own son, which I agreed with. The issue was, she still isn\u2019t a legal adult, so I was the executor and guardian to all her inheritance, not her mother. \n\nMy wife, as I said, came from a super poverished family. Her own brother even attempted to prostitute her out for money. She started with nothing and now has a very lucrative career, I\u2019m so freaking proud of her. Nonetheless, when I received an inheritance, she was dumbstruck by the amount. She knew my parents were well off, but not by how much, so she shared with her mom some investments we were focusing on to protect the money instead of spending it on toys. \n\nSo yea, all boiled down to her mom telling the rest of their family of the \u201cfortune my wife stumbled upon\u201d, and all of them coming forward to ask for money. My older brother also said he had rights to the inheritance equal to us, and also demanded money. Resulted in my older brother filing lawsuits on my younger brother and I, along with a few from my family in laws on the wife\u2019s side. \n\nFortunately, everything from my wife\u2019s side failed since they weren\u2019t entitled to anything belonging to my parents, and her brother is technically a fugitive the fled the country and has no way to successfully file suit here lol. My older brother failed his suits cause the court deemed my parents and their estate did not make an error, and that their reasoning to skip him to his daughter cause of his whole lifestyle was acceptable, and the judge even criticized him for trying to take his own daughters inheritance and future from her. \n\nSucks you weren\u2019t able to get all that nonsense to be dropped. Family can honestly be the worst people in our lives at times.",

I was in KCMO going to DeVry and dropped everything because her boyfriend/2nd cousin left her.  Yep that too among other nasty things, but I digress.  Got a call with a big sob story so trying to be the good son I basically packed up everything and left to go home and deal with stuff.  My uncle drove down to help pack and drive back because my girlfriend couldn't drive stick nor could she handle a Uhaul.  She drove my mothers 97 S10 Blazer back and her car was on a trailer behind the Uhaul.  For YEARS afterwards my mother claimed I ruined the transmission in that blazer for pulling a car behind it even though I didn't nor would I with a Uhaul there to handle it... \n\nGot home and unloaded and the \"you can't do anything right\" stuff started up.  House was on 120 acres of land and main heat source was wood or propane.  Wood is cheap when you can cut down some trees so outside of getting everyone else setup to do some basics I start hunting down wood for heating so I can process it over a couple months and hopefully have it dry enough to use that winter.  Not ideal but still better than the alternative of paying for propane.  Nope I was wrong, needed to mow the yard because she couldn't be bothered to deal with it.  Oh and I did that wrong too.\n\nEventually all the BS came to a head when my mother let someone drive my girlfriends (now married) vehicle and wrecked it, then a few months later she did the same thing with a replacement vehicle.  Wife and I were going to try and lease a little pickup and basically NO ONE else was driving it, this pissed my mother off and there was a big fight.  Tried to leave but was told constantly that if I ever wanted to leave her home I would be lucky to get the clothes on my back.  Ended up driving a wrecked vehicle with the radiator cracked and some other stuff goofed to the sheriff's substation so we could go get our clothes.  She wouldn't even let my wife take her wedding dress which ended up with cat feces and urine all over it.  Ended up getting a restraining order against my mother because she had choked my wife and was making threats.\n\nIn the mean time the rest of the family wanted nothing to do with me for the most part.  Stayed with my grandmother a couple days till that was found out and ended up walking as the car had completely died by this point.  Couldn't lease the vehicle so settled for a used car we could buy with our tax refunds.  Problems continued as because my mother could not contact she started sending others and someone from the sheriff's office for a \"wellness check\" even though it was harassment.  \n\nAfter a year of no contact we talked again for a bit and tried to make things work.  Ended up with a ton of other issues, becoming homeless, losing our vehicle and most all of our possessions and my wife had a miscarriage again and we were wrong for removing my son from life support... The cycle started over again and we ended up leaving for the last time with a bag of clothes each, a pillow, and a CD player Alarm clock.  From that point on I have completely broken contact, my aunt, uncle, grandfather, grandmother, and likely mother (not sure because I wouldn't put it past them to lie for me to contact) are all dead and I never went to a funeral.  My grandfather called my son a bastard child and he would not acknowledge him as blood, my other uncle lived in the house my grandmother had and gutted the appliances among other things for meth and then the house was sold at a tax sale even though it was supposed to be partly mine and my cousins, basically a complete cluster of lets use whomever however they can with the rest.",

Even if they had good jobs they just hated anyone not them that did ok. \n\nFor years my cousin got hell because she must think she is better than them, especially from her own mum, why because she got a mortgage instead of renting.

Letting family back in his life was just the shit icing on an already terrible decision. That's just kind of common sense 101. My husband and I long ago had that conversation and agreed it's a need-to-know or not at all kind of thing. \n\nEspecially after the way we saw my \"loving family\" act after my mom's death which included a brother posting my mother died two weeks before she did, just to get sympathy likes on Facebook then trying to steal part of the unused funeral funds, him and another family member trying to get their hands on a life insurance policy that included all of the kids but apparently they wanted everyone's share and not just their own, and the relatives in charge of her estate trying to tell my husband and I a property we purchased from my mother years before had to be put back into the estate and purchased again or put up for sale. Fortunately we had the same attorney she did and he had to read everyone the riot act and got them all backed up.\n\nThis was all over an estate that was worth exactly maybe $2,000 tops - a broken down car, some clothes and jewelry, that's it. It didn't even have to go to probate court, because of how little there was in the \"estate.\" And all of these wonderful relatives I'd never have dreamed would turn on me since I'd been my mother's main caretaker through her last four years were more than happy to try and shake me down for money. I even got told at one point I should pay for the funeral since \"you took care of her last.\" \n\nYeah, we don't speak anymore. So yes, we had that conversation. That OP didn't is where he screwed up and truly I'm kind of side-eyeing the whole story to be honest. Terrible horrible family, you never tell them about your lottery winnings, but don't tell the wife to keep her yap shut? Okay.",

      "text": "Honestly, fuck your sister.  She sees that you've got your life together with a house and kid and suddenly isn't happy for you because you managed to catch a lucky break a decade ago?  If you ever deign to deal with her again, ask her how she felt about your life situation when she thought you were paying a mortgage.  Then ask her how you getting lucky, based on choices you made makes it any different.  Would she be happy for you, but only if you're drowning in debt and facing an uphill financial battle for decades to come?\n\nThat was clearly the reason you didn't tell your family.  And your sister was apparently happy to prove you right.  A good sister would simply be happy that her niece or nephew is set up for a beneficial childhood with as much opportunities to thrive as possible.  And if she can't empathize with their situation and being able to make that so much different from her upbringing, then she still has a lot of improvement she can do.\n\nEdit: May be a little harsh.  But if you think there's a possibility, do try to patch things up with at least your sister.  You can't choose family.  Let her know you care about her and the rest of your family, but caring for others and being beholden to them are two entirely different concepts.  Let her know you'll always be there.  You may not always see eye to eye, but you'll listen and be honest about your opinion.  Family drama can have very long-lasting and far-reaching consequences and once they start playing the silent game, it just becomes even harder to breach the issue as time goes on.  In my family, my mothers' siblings hardly speak to one another even though my aunt is terminally ill.  Nobody remembers the reason why they're not speaking anymore and it's just sad to see.",

That, also resulting in low self-worth. As I learned this in therapy - plus years of bettering myself and raising my own self -worth, I finally have healthy boundaries - but it took decades for me.\nI'm truly happy you won some money and bettered yourself from your rough childhood.

We had the forethought to insist that he hire a lawer for his case as the other party at fault tried to play it off that my father caused the accident instead of them (despite dozens of witnesses at the scene of the accident that saw otherwise). By the time everything settled up, the lawyer was successful at helping my father get his social security disability benefits started and he would up with a close to 7 figure settlement before the lawyer got his cut. We knew not to tell anyone outside of our immediate family that he won the settlement as they'd start this kind of crap wanting hand-outs. God rest my father's soul he passed over 10 years later due to complications with Lung cancer caused by Xarelto and we just got the settlement for the class action Xarelto lawsuit and once again knew better than to tell anyone outside of our family that my mom had gotten a settlement for it.  \n\n\nThe money's all gone now, Pop lived on his settlement until he passed, my mom is in the final stages of drawing out the last few monthly payments for the settlement and it'll finish any time now. The Xarelto settlement wasn't as large as you would have thought, and my mom split that one between me, my brother and herself and we all used it to pay bills.  \n\n\nI guarantee you that if any of our extended family had found out about it, they'd have been hounding the hell out of my father or my mother wanting money.  \n\n\nIt just goes to show you, just because you may be biologically related to someone else, it doesn't mean that they're your family.",

I got the feeling they felt I should have shared that but I got a family and they come first. Millions I would share out, thousands doesn\u2019t put a dent in anyones long term finances.",

I look back as a disabled vet..and still feel lucky. Very poor family single mom had to give up (she died when I enlisted- not like any of us were looking back to be together anymore). Dad the stranger took us all in out of nowhere. I was even homeless as disabled... I am early 90s product. Dumb as the 'nam stories. That is the 21 a day crowd, I know it now. I did not stop however. in recent years I learned my family history. Very appalachian like, we even have native american. Our wall breaker was being extremely diverse... like we cannot be nailed down. One sibling to the next is a another universe (4 of us). That was very good as adult years came in. A younger sister I gave advice to, ended up the luckiest. Same military unit..now at 30 years. All the stripes. Lottery is a nice extra, congrats to you. I also have a younger bother who is substance abuse and had jail. One we never met has a million dollar place..a business man. We were all got together yesterday for a holiday meal. Sister has the house to host.. We don't have that take everyone or nothing mentality.",
