There are some other reasons for it like not wanting a bunch of casuals flooding 4chan which ruined /b/, /v/, and /pol/, the admins have been upset with us before about links to smaller sites, 4chan raids being spread on reddit this way and blowing up on the launchpad, I have a tiny penis, things like that\n\nLinking to 4chan archives however is just fine.

But we encrypted that shit. The names of characters were initials of the funny nicknames we made up for kids we didn\u2019t like, and they were stick figures so even if we made one look like a kid in class it was only a vague resemblance and the initials didn\u2019t match anyone\u2019s name. \n\nI think the fact that they were stick figures also helped to soften the violence so we never got in trouble when a teacher saw them, but we were inspired by those old don hertzfeldt cartoons so there was still a lot of blood lol good times.",
