It attempts to say antifa = democrats, which would be immediately refuted, so they can\u2019t say it directly; it has to be done the charlatan way.\n\nSo how they do it is make statement like this guy did about how \u201cboth sides\u201d have extremism and violence right. So in this instance the term \u201cboth sides\u201d refers to antifa and self proclaimed republicans.\n\nLeft side: actual leftists that hate democrats as much as they hate republicans \n\nRight side: self identified republicans \n\nThen republicans use the \u201cboth sides\u201d term to frame it as both sides as in the two main political parties.\n\nSo they use it daily as:\n\nLeft side: now democrats\n\nRight side: the same republicans as before.\n\nThey bait and switch antifa into democrats and pretend they are the same thing.\n\nThey are not. Not at all.\n\nAntifa are not democrats in any way shape or form.\n\nEdit: this person doesn\u2019t seem k be American so they are more the target of what I described and we can see how well it works huh.",

They stupidly believe in racist policies, like reperations , and think that money supply has nothing to do with inflation.  Its like being a flat earther.  The left is also profoundly stupid because in these situations they have no legal grasp over the stupid concepts like \"substantive due process\" (you've probably never heard of it) and how even people like RGB thought it was dumb.  The left lives in fantasy land who think that 1619 project is real history.  They cannot define what a man or a woman is.  They cannot even grasp the idea of federalism and natural rights.  They have no political philosophy and have no semblance of an understanding of what the govt should and shouldn't do.  It's simply up to their emotions.  Funnily enough, \"my body my choice\" doesn't seem to apply to if you want to take a non-approved FDA drug.

Once they hit adulthood, the Standards of Care require trans men to undergo either 3 months of Real-life-test or psychological evaluation before surgery whereas\u00a0trans women are required to undergo 18 months of hormone therapy.\n\nSo young trans kids (or kids who are exploring if they're trans) are in no danger, and having supportive parents and a loving homelife make kids know it's safe to explore who they truely are, and that's a good thing.",

I don't need to test my own logic about living on a globe and not a stack of turtles, or being allowed to control who enters my body, or if my great aunt is trying to make contact from the other side.

There are facts and information out there. I certainly don't need to test my logic with people who haven't looked into their own position.

But it seems to be the latest data we have, unfortunately. \n\n>reddit isn't an echo-chamber itself, it just promotes people creating their own echo chambers.\n\nI agree there too. That definitely is the case.\n\nI just think that *generally,* because of the demographics of reddit, the stuff on the front page tends to be biased in a very clear direction. The average person on reddit is like a 20-something dude in the tech industry who leans left, so that certainty affects the overall feeling of the top posts and comments. It can actually make you start feeling like an outsider if you aren't a 20-something in the tech industry, which doesn't accurately represent the real world.",

For example, you are not legally compelled to donate organs, even to save a life, even if the person who would be saved is your child, or even if you\u2019re dead.  \n\n\nPeople who try to counter the argument from bodily autonomy by saying that there\u2019s a second body involved don\u2019t understand the argument at all.  They heard \u201cmy body my choice\u201d and made their own assumptions about what that means without ever attempting to learn what their opponents actually think.\n\n\nAs is often the case, one side is talking past the other, but not the other way around.\n\n\nThe pro-choice argument is that a fetus isn\u2019t a living being with full rights, but even if you think it is, it still can\u2019t infringe on another person\u2019s body, just like nobody else can.",

Natural rights are rights which are supposed to be eternal. The whole concept is that they always were and always will be because they are not bound by men. They don't appear one by one. And natural rights are not necessarily supposed to be applied. For many, they're supposed to represent an ideal state before the social contract. For a lot of people, they don't even exist even as a concept and they reject the idea of it. And even for the people that do believe in it and think they should be apply, many believe there are exceptions to killing such as the death penalty (which was very common until the 20th century) and \"just wars\". \n\nBtw, Rousseau and Hobbes are not obscure philosopher at all. They're two of the most renowned in the history of philosophy. Not knowing them is like not knowing Plato or Epicurus. \n\nI'm just trying to understand why you intervened in this discussion when you brought up a concept which had nothing to do with the rest of the discussion and that you obviously don't even understand.",

Not using a vaccine is not just \u201cpotential\u201d to harm others, it is damn sure you are harming others, it\u2019s just that since he\u2019ll prolly never know who he\u2019s killing and it can\u2019t be traced back to him, he\u2019s ok with it. The concept is identical, he is ok to say someone else what to do with her body because of a life he doesn\u2019t know nor will ever meet, to the point that he is ok with her getting pregnant and carrying a child for 9 months, risking her own life for a pregnancy she may not want to carry, but he is not ok with someone telling him to get a little puncture, a way lower risk than a pregnancy and way lower quality of life impacting aswell, 3 days fever max versus 9 months pregnancy. The journalist was on point on asking that question which was the perfect question to ask to someone short circuiting his brain that way. It is all about the fact that as a civilian he sees that problem as more evident while actually the second one is the most impacting on the society, it\u2019s just that since it is submerged data to him since he doesn\u2019t know who he kills and if he dies from it himself he wouldn\u2019t care anyways then the second problem is a potential harm. It is not, else vaccines wouldn\u2019t exist and we wouldn\u2019t use them on our children when they are born. \nFor the same identical reason that we care about life, for real and not for show, we vaccinate our children when they are born, but he seems to understand pregnancy up until the children is born, after that he can die happily since he won\u2019t take his vaccine.",

Those comparisons are useful in trying to draw out a principle.  For example: if the 9 month fetus is halfway out of the birth canal, does it deserve any protection from aggression?  How about 10% out of it?\n\nBy the way, I'm not arguing that he is right, but it's not as if his argument is stupid or contradictory.  Neither the left or the right have truly principled or comprehensive arguments around this.\n\nOnly libertarians, and specifically those that believe in Evectionism, in my option, have a correct opinion from both a moral and legal perspective of abortion.  Other than that, both the left and the right are this guy: a decent but not fully fleshed out or fully-principled argument.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: by the way, want to talk about contradictory:  Where is the \"my body my choice people when it comes to using non-FDA approved drugs?

In that context, the prior statement is doing double work as both an attempt to point out an opponent's \"hypocrisy\" and an attempt to support the position he states next, and it can't do both.  That's the contradiction that I see.  His second sentence wasn't an expansion or indictment of the other side, as you would do if you were speaking to the perspective of the other side.  It was his own belief.\n\n\nI'm also happy to grant that he's probably bad to making the point he wants to make in an interview.  That's a hard thing to do.  But the point he made, whether he intended it to be or not, is self-contradictory.",

They genuinely think abortion seekers are so depraved they don't suffer when they are forced to give up a child.

This number compounds, as last year's still need homes but 25% of this year's also don't get one. The chances get worse with every year they age. Right now, we have around 100,000 children still waiting to be adopted, and that has been on an increase.\n\n25-40% of kids in the foster system historically experience abuse or maltreatment, but many state organizations dramatically under-report it. An investigation into Iowa, for example, which stated 99.7% of kids in foster care experience no abuse, found that they hadn't counted any reports that they, themselves, did not make. In other words, if the child, police, or other figure reported it, even if there were legal charges... it only counted if *the state foster program* investigated it and declared it abuse. Go figure.",

They had me placed before I was even born. So, so many kids don't get even close to that. It just baffles me to see things like that written on a medical chart by a doctor, that special steps need taken to ensure the adoptive mother gets that full bonding experience.

[GFM is a Baptist organization](https://goodfaithmedia.org/history/).\n\nThe GFM article has a link related to the study and that points to the Barna Group website. The Barna Group is \"[a go-to source for insights about faith and culture](https://www.barna.com/about/).\" This particular study was [done in 2013 and surveyed 1,000 respondents](https://www.barna.com/research/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-adoption/). They don't specify the population they drew from and they don't specify how the questions were phrased. It also reports a 3.1% margin of error and claims that 5% of Christians adopt which puts most of their claim that Christians are 2x more likely to adopt in question, beyond potential sampling error.\n\nThat's your evidence that Christians adopt more often? A study by a group that specializes in religious surveys and doesn't specify their research methods?\n\nEdit: added a link and corrected spelling",

I think women should be able to have access to abortions because they have that unalienable right to their own body.\n\nDon't you think ideally no one would want someone to be harmed and the world was a perfect place full of rainbows and butterflies? Sure. I do too. All I was really trying to say was that in comparison to all of the countries the US labor mortality rate is low but in comparison to other developed countries it is higher. I wish it was 0. But for some reason you think I hate women lol.\n\nI think that using the potential harm to the woman is a weaker argument than saying that women have the right to their own bodies because that's what it fundamentally is. Using reasons other than that kinda undermines the pro-choice argument. If one thinks of the fetus as its own life. Ideally i think the woman has the right to remove the fetus from her own body but not necessarily kill the fetus. \n\nAnd Yeah I listed the study on infant mortality rates because that's one of the things the person I responded to talked about or maybe it's because I don't care about women /sarcasm",

The age of viability, meaning the age a fetus can survive outside the womb, is 24 weeks. Well into the second trimester. At that point it\u2019s *possible* a fetus can survive if given extensive (and expensive) medical intervention. This is what you consider the ideal alternative to abortion? Are you serious?\n\nPlease don\u2019t give people advice on how to debate before you have a basic understanding of the topic at hand.",

                  "text": "Pregnancy can be hell on pregnant people because pregnancy literally changes the entire makeup of the pregnant person's body and brain; the latter, often permanently.\n\nIn the first trimester, you gain 1 or 2 kilograms, or maybe less if you have morning sickness. Most of this weight is in the placenta (which feeds the fetus), your breasts, your uterus and extra blood. You gain another 6 kilograms in the second trimester, and your heartbeat and breathing rate become faster; you may experience mental health issues; and your hair, fingernails, and even possibly your teeth (i.e. calcium loss) change.\n\nBy the third trimester, you gain another 5 kilograms. Much of this weight is your baby, but also amniotic fluid, the placenta, your breasts, your blood and your uterus. The baby may be placing pressure on your lungs, making it harder to breathe.\n\nOverall, blood volume increases significantly within the first few weeks of gestation, and increases progressively throughout the pregnancy. The total blood volume increase varies from 20% to 100% above pre-pregnancy levels, usually close to 45%. That means that pregnant women have about 50% more blood volume than non-pregnant women.\n\nAdditionally, a 2019 study showed that blood plasma volume increases by 6% in the first trimester, by 29% at the end of the second trimester, and 48% by the third trimester. Overall, cardiac output also increases by 30-50%; hence, the faster heart rate.\n\nThe aforementioned increase in circulation that occurs during pregnancy causes many women's faces to appear brighter, or flushed. And, as the American Pregnancy Association reports, as women's bodies produce more hormones, their oil glands can go into overdrive, similar to puberty, and which may or may not cause acne or pimples.\n\nThroughout your pregnancy, hormones (especially the aptly named \"relaxin\") also help soften the ligaments that hold your bones together, sometimes causing pain and discomfort. The level of carbon dioxide in your blood also lowers, and depending, changing hormones may cause a spike in your sex drive - or completely eliminate it.\n\nPregnancy [re-sculpts a pregnant person's brain for at least 2 years](https://www.science.org/content/article/pregnancy-resculpts-women-s-brains-least-2-years); [may cause lasting or permanent changes to the brain](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pregnancy-causes-lasting-changes-in-a-womans-brain/); and [leads to grey matter volume reductions](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33525512/).\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic:\n\n>A recent review of 20 studies assessing more than 700 pregnant and 500 nonpregnant women concluded that general cognitive functioning, memory and executive functioning were significantly poorer in pregnant women.\n\nLastly, oxytocin - the so-called \u201clove hormone\u201d - increases dramatically during pregnancy and the postpartum period, causing mood swings. The first time a mother smells her child, the reward circuitry is activated in the center of the brain - the caudate nucleus - so that the baby\u2019s odor acts somewhat like an addictive drug, releasing dopamine in abundance. From that moment on, the smell of any infant will stimulate this area of \u200b\u200bthe brain.",

Adopting kids like that is very affordable. Maybe not *very* affordable for most people, but it\u2019s like $5k tops. Some lawyers will help pro bono in these cases. I have a huge heart for those kids and am doing what I can now for those kids (now young adults) who have aged out of the system, but people need to understand that these are separate groups of adoptable kids.\n\nInfants from mothers with no substance issues = loooooong waitlist + very expensive process. People very much want to adopt these kids!\n\nOlder kids with substance abuse/trauma backgrounds = waiting in foster care, not expensive to adopt. If you have space in your home and heart to deal with some unraveling trauma, please do!\n\nObviously there is a bit of a continuum, but these are the two ends of the spectrum.",

You post makes 0 sense in the context here.\n\nPoster claimed it the responsibility of others to get vaccinated to protect people who can't get vaccinated. But that logic is flawed in multiple ways.   For one that there are other people walking around unvaccinated for medical reasons and second even people who are vaccinated can still carry and spread covid although to a lesser degree. So the person without vaccine is still responsible for his own safety and if he/she want to be 100% safe they should stop going near crowds and protect themselves (masks/distancing)",

You pointed out correctly that the vaccine protects your neighbours as well, but this man\u2019s thinking did not go this deep, so he believes vaccine indeed is \u201cmy body my choice\u201d\n\nMy point is he is not being hypocritical, his intentions are not double standards. His understanding is that one is not the same as the other.\n\nMy belief about hypocrisy is a persons intentions and understanding of a double standard. There is no clear and obvious double standard here. Both of these topics are very complex, and his understanding/opinion of one is much different than others understanding/opinions. Plus, his understanding/opinion of the other is also different from other peoples understanding/opinion. It makes for a lot of variables, which makes me give him the benefit of the doubt that there is no malice in his intention.\n\nAn example of a clear an obvious double standard is that women have a societal expectation to smile more than men do. The example is the same for one standard as it is for the other, it can be very easily compared, and as far as everyone knows, there\u2019s nothing that should be stopping a man from smiling more too, so why is the pressure on the women to smile more? Unfortunately, our topic here is too complex with too many variables, and a lot of different understandings and opinions.",

This was settled when a family member sued for their sibling pulling the plug on their brain-dead father. \n\nThe fetus does not have medically defined meaningful neurological function until 21 weeks. 99.9% of abortions occur before this cut off. The remaining 0.1% cases after this cut off are to save the mother. This is the absolute earliest a fetus can be born and saved. One could easily argue the pregnancy is not viable until this point.",

I\u2019ll copy paste from one of my responses that explains my thoughts a bit more on it:\n\nHe believes abortion is killing a child, so \u201cmy body my choice\u201d doesn\u2019t apply here (in his view), since there is an innocent victim\n\nHe believes that vaccines only effect the person jabbed. You pointed out correctly that the vaccine protects your neighbours as well, but this man\u2019s thinking did not go this deep, so he believes vaccine indeed is \u201cmy body my choice\u201d (I would have preferred that the interviewer guy made this point to him, rather than go for the \u201cgotcha\u201d moment, such as: \u201cdo you realise that you not getting vaccinated does indeed affect other peoples bodies for these reasons?\u201d). If he then says yea but it\u2019s still my body my choice, then he is indeed a hypocrite. \n\nMy point is he is not being hypocritical, his intentions are not double standards. His understanding is that one is not the same as the other.\n\nMy belief about hypocrisy is a persons intentions and understanding of a double standard, and both standards need to be easily and equally comparable. There is no clear and obvious double standard here. Both of these topics are very complex, and his understanding/opinion of one is much different than others understanding/opinions. Plus, his understanding/opinion of the other is also different from other peoples understanding/opinion. It makes for a lot of variables (comparing apples to oranges), which makes me give him the benefit of the doubt that there is no malice in his intention.\n\nAn example of a clear an obvious double standard is that women have a societal expectation to smile more than men do. The example is the same for one standard as it is for the other, it can be very easily compared (apples to apples), and as far as everyone knows, there\u2019s nothing that should be stopping a man from smiling more too, so why is the pressure on the women to smile more? Unfortunately, our topic here is too complex with too many variables, and a lot of different understandings and opinions.\n\nSo I\u2019d say that he is a bit ignorant on his view of vaccines and abortion, but IMO that doesn\u2019t make him a hypocrite. Hypocritical accusations should be more clear and obvious double standards, the double standard here has a lot of gray area",

For the people who do believe it\u2019s a life, the discussion is more complex but I highly recommend JJ Thompson\u2019s essay on abortion. It all but settled the issue of abortion in the ethical philosophy community.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t think anyone should be forced to vaccinate.

Just trying to elaborate the opposing viewpoint to bring more accurate discussion) To a pro-life person, life is different from \u201clife\u201d, if you know what I\u2019m saying. Like, if there\u2019s a certain threshold that will inevitably be crossed somewhere along the way (with the exception of complications that would kill the fetus) then a logical conclusion that can very easily be come to is that the creation of the future human being sets in motion a path from \u201clife\u201d to actual life that it would be cruel and even murderous to impede that progress (murderous is a stretch). Obviously if they want women to be delivering babies that will be stillborn/die or put themselves in danger they\u2019re a psycho, but I think that beyond that there\u2019s a far more deep-seated problem. Despite how strongly I feel, there\u2019s simply no objective answer on when it is and isn\u2019t fair to stop that development. I think there\u2019s a nuance to be had and would base it off of currently available science, but there are other viewpoints that genuinely have merit, but are simply expressed entirely the wrong way by entirely the wrong people.

No?  \nAll categorizations are arbitrary *to a degree.* But we need categories and some categorizations are better suited to capture certain phenomena than others. They are not \"entirely arbitrary\" as you put it.  \nI absolutely agree with you that personhood should be the focus here and that personhood requires consciousness *and* that personhood brings with it most of the (moral) rights and obligations.

Or perhaps more specifically, when is it human *enough* that its survival should be prioritized over the mother's wellbeing? Or should it be at all?\n\nAt that point it becomes somewhat of a variation of the trolley problem: say there's an out of control trolley which, if nothing is done, will hit a woman stuck in the track (representing the pregnant woman), or if the track is switched it will hit the fetus on the other track (ignoring for a second the fact that it can't survive outside the mother). Let's say the woman would be put in a lot of pain by getting hit and the medical bills (representing the costs of caring for a child) would take a huge toll, and that the fetus would die if it got hit, but it would be over quick and it would never know the life it's missing. Let's also say that the control for switching the track represents getting an abortion and is located on the ground next to the woman. Finally, let's say there's a control tower that can remotely lock the tracks to prevent them from switching (representing the government outlawing abortion).\n\nNow, the people against abortion would basically be saying that it's the control tower's duty to lock the tracks to protect the fetus from the mother switching the track and sending the trolley to it. The people in favor of access to abortion would be saying that it should be up to the mother to decide whether to switch the track and that the control tower shouldn't be dooming her to being hit by the trolley.\n\nNow this isn't a perfect analogy, but I think it illustrates the issue decently. Of course, anyone is free to correct me or bring up things I missed.",

We often paint with too broad of a brush. I've heard the vaccine is different because vaxx affects others and is selfish etc. I'd say a lot of abortions are selfish and certainly affects the unborn child and potentially the other parent, but it's their choice to make and they have their reasons, some good reasons, some bad ones. I'd also say at this point everyone who wants a vaccine has had it and is as protected personally as they're going to be. There no stopping it from spreading to most people at some point even if a few more people get the vaxx",

They would deprive an actual, living, breathing, conscious, sapient person of their basic human rights, bodily autonomy, and self-determination because of some cells that person happens to be hosting.

It gets a jump start at birth, where detachment from the umbilical cuts off the supply of those chemicals while, at the same time, the fetus receives a massive flood of norepinepherine. This starts the process of developing consciousness and sapience.\n\nThink about the evolutionary \u201clogic\u201d behind this. Pregnancy is very dangerous and and very high risk even in ideal circumstances. A fetus is an incomplete organism and completely at the mercy of it\u2019s host body. Developing consciousness, and therefore the behaviors that come with it, in-utero only increases the risk to the host and therefore to the fetus as well.\n\nSee: Lagercrantz, H., Changeux, JP.

Then they have to decide if they want \"choice\" (no vaccine mandates, easy to access abortion at any stage) or pro-forced-pregnancy (no abortions, but the government can arrest you and tie you up on a gurney to administer the covid vaccine). \n\nThere is no way for them to be consistent, except by saying that infecting someone with a virus with a 0.01 chance of death \"isnt killing\" or that the vaccine \"kills more\". Both of which are verifiably untrue. (Say I inject someone with a poison that has a 0.01 chance of killing them, i dont think many people would disagree that that is me, killing a person)\n\nI respectfully disagree that \"you can't be wrong if its only an opinion\", theres just a teensy bit more nuance than that",

If instead he hits a lamp post which falls on the victim, is he less of a killer? If a person shoots someone with a gun and that person dies, he's probably a killer, right? What if he aimed for the leg to stop someone from running, is he still a killer? \n\nIn all those cases, a person causes the death of a living being.

But that doesn't mean you get to throw them in the trash just to force me to get a large pepperoni.\n\n*Edit*\n\nI'll add, how am I or anyone else supposed to know you have a 'hidden reason' for your argument if, y'know, it's hidden? If your whole stated argument is that \"sprouts are icky and I don't like them\" and don't tell us that \"oh, also my father ate a sprout in front of me and he choked to death and its caused a deep-seated trauma that I've never gotten over\", how is anyone supposed to address your argument properly?",

              "text": "While some may be, the vast majority of anti-abortioners aren't some comic villain whose ultimate goal is to oppress women. These people are deluded, and trying to rationally argue with a deluded person will never work. \n\nA lot of anti-abortion sentiment is religious. It is impossible to make an effective secular or scientific argument against a religious zealot. If the person you are speaking with is religious, the best way to get through to them is through religious argument. Since there is a massive overlap between Christianity and anti-abortion, here are some helpful pro-abortion Bible passages.\n\nFirst off, we have Exodus. It should be noted, that Leviticus is filled with laws that no longer apply (it says its only for a specific tribe of Israel as long as Aaron and his sons are still alive. However, there is a part which mentions the penalty for hitting a pregnant woman and causing a miscarriage. If the baby dies, it is a fine. If there is any damage to the mother, the government will damage the person equally. Thats the famous verse \"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, burn for burn, life for life\". Again, this is from Leviticus, but we can assume that, if a fetus is a human life, it wouldn't make sense for the punishment to killing a fetus to be a mere fine, while the punishment for killing the mother is death. This shows that God clearly values a fetus as signiricantly less than a human life, and thus that a fetus is not a human life. \n\nThen we have Numbers. In the book of Numbers it describes something known as the ordeal of bitter water, where it instructs priests to give a pregnant woman a bitter tincture which will cause her to miscarry. \n\nFurthermore, there are many parts of the Bible which says that a human is granted a soul when it breathes the breath of life, or the breath of God, implying that life begins at first breath.",

Why does one person carry all the burden of keeping both people alive? If it really is two people in one body that both deserve individual rights, shouldn't both people also contribute equally to keeping the body alive?

Your anachronistic and unsupported assumptions notwithstanding.\n\nThe advances I am speaking of are well documented and easily found by a casual Google adventure. Namely: the understanding of when the zygote is formed (ie, when a distinct human life starts), and more importantly, our understanding of the *smooth development of a human organism from zygote to newborn which yields no evidence of any distinctive transition from non-person to person* (as opposed to traditional/unscientific accounts of personhood/\u201censoulment\u201d beginning at the \u201cquickening\u201d, for instance). In short - Modern science has conclusively shown that there is no principled way of substantively distinguishing the death of a 10 week old human embryo from the death of a 1 year old. Flat out\n\nPersonally I am receptive to the idea that a human life isn\u2019t a person (whatever your definition) until a certain threshold, ranging from conception to several years after birth, but my confidence for this belief varies only somewhat along the timeline. So if I believe killing a 2 year old is abhorrent, which I do, and should therefore be illegal, then killing a 10 week old is just about as abhorrent (since I do not see a principled difference between the two lives), and should therefore also be illegal (though not necessarily subject to the same schema of enforcement/punishment).\n\nAs should be clear, the above analysis renders all concerns about post-birth inconvenience/difficulty irrelevant as relates to both mother and child, in the same way that such concerns are irrelevant to the question of whether killing a 1 year old is wrong.",

The moral concept of life in the case of a foetus is different to sperm and eggs because a foetus is a **result** and has **already** been created. Sperm undergo no process on their own, and by the time they have instigated a process they have become a fertilised egg, which I argue then holds value. (Eggs split at a cellular level and create organs without the mother for example, the egg follows a cycle of its own.) They are two similar processes in the sense they need two things, but otherwise it is a false equivalence. You cannot say a sperm holds the same value as a foetus simply because it instigates the process. The key and mechanism used when opening a door is important, but the **most** important part about a door is that it opens. Some people do make the argument that sperm is sacrosanct and you may think I would use that against abortion myself but I am an individual and do not.\n\n>Unless it\u2019s embryos in cold storage or perhaps in an IVF treatment. You think that is psychopathic?\n\nPlease stop comparing me with the Catholic church. No. I don't. Firstly you negate the fact that IVF is simply a different method of conception so to say it is psychopathic is flawed right off the bat. Cold Storage is another ethical issue altogether removed from abortion but in my opinion it is a completely acceptable practice considering that the foetus is still capable of future sentience. The danger of those practices is another matter. The psychopathic nature is to do with the **moral value** placed upon the foetus and its state, not about the processes.\n\n>The same applies to fetuses.\n\nNo, not in the same way at all, it is on your part a false equivalence. It **is** true that the foetus is dependent on the mother for continued life, and the woman for the continued success of the process, but that isn't the same as being a cell that starts the process off initially. You cannot say ***\"\\[A\\] requires \\[B\\] to start a process and \\[C\\] requires \\[D\\] to maintain the process thus \\[A\\] and \\[B\\] must hold the same moral value as \\[C\\] and \\[D\\].\"*** that is a logical fallacy and takes into account **no** degree of nuance in the state of being. Eggs and sperm are not sentient and will never become sentient individually, a fertilised egg will but it needs to be maintained by the mother. Those are two completely different types of processes, it is **illogical** to view them as the same. There is **no** contradiction in holding different moral value when two things are objectively not the same.\n\n>In my opinion, when they are viable.\n\nSee I can understand and respect why you believe this, and in an attempt to Steelman your argument, I think you believe this because you place more value on the life of the woman than on the future life of the foetus. If this is a true rendition of your beliefs, then I actually agree with you. What I do not agree with, however, is dehumanisation of a foetus as morally inferior to a woman, that is because I consider a child to be 'unborn' from conception. This is **ONLY** a statement regarding the **moral value** I place on the foetus and **not to do** with the literal life it may or may not have. Does that make more sense? (Not facetiously said, I am genuinely asking if it makes more sense.)\n\nThe following statements you have made I will break down so you can gauge better what I **personally** believe rather than your prejudicial assumptions. I say that in such a way not because I want to be facetious, but to challenge your perspective and provide evidence to the fact that I am equally as complex as you are in my understanding.\n\n>If you truly believe that embryos and fetuses are life\n\n**I don't.** I believe its vastly more complex than that. I do not consider them 'alive', but I do not consider them an equivalent of dead either. I have said they are 'unalive' which is a better terminology because it takes into account the moral principle of their future life, which I hold as valuable.\n\n>wacky anti-abortion stuff must follow from it\n\nNo, this is an obvious logical fallacy. My beliefs are complex and, importantly, they are my own beliefs. I genuinely believe both sides of this argument peddle idiotic, oversimplistic concepts, and you can put me into either box if you like but I will overtly state it is not true. I do not claim to have all the answers, but it isn't fair to box me into a corner as an enemy simply because I disagree with you. Also, do you mean the American wacky as in 'bad' or the more English wacky as in 'silly'?\n\n>such as charging someone who accidentally kills a bunch of embryos with mass murder\n\nI despise the idea that a woman should be charged with murder over embryos because that legal concept doesn't take into account the realistic nature of abortion or the moral grey area that they are in, it is another oversimplification and I think it is incorrect. My belief that there is some moral responsibility in regards to abortion **does not mean** I believe there should be legal repercussions.\n\n>and having a funeral for miscarriages\n\nI have no opinion on if we should have funeral services for miscarriages or abortions, it really depends on the level of value the couple placed upon that foetus. Humans ritualise many things, so if someone wants to grieve over a lost baby, or non-baby, regardless of scenario, then I don't think I would have a right to claim such things 'wacky' regardless of if you mean bad or strange or both.",

Yes, IVF is a different process, but those are still (usually) seven embryos of which usually one, two or none will go on to become a living breathing human. \n\n>no degree on nuance in the state of being\u2026.\n\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at though. I personally believe there *is* nuance in the state of being. And rather than try to determine exactly what that nuance is in a logical fashion (which I think is impossible), I look to the humanist part of my philosophy (does this \u201cfeel\u201d wrong?) and combine it with the liberal side of my philosophy (is this logically consistent with other morals?) to reach my conclusion. I don\u2019t need to ask myself if a sperm or egg or fetus is life, because what really matters in this specific case is does abortion constitute murder? If abortion is not murder, then is it manslaughter? If it is not manslaughter, then should it be a crime at all? \n\nIn the end, the purpose of laws is to create a just and functional society. We should not lose sight of that. No pro-choice person is saying \u201cabort babies!\u201d, but pro-life people really are saying \u201cthrow those murderers in jail, no abortions, no exceptions!\u201d Which side has the good of society in mind? \n\n>you place more value on the life of the woman than on the future life of the fetus. \n\nI do, but that\u2019s only in a handful of cases where the mother\u2019s life is in serious danger. It really does come down to medical privacy and self-determination for me. I think that whatever restrictions people want to place on abortion would cause an undue intrusion on the life of the woman. Religion does come into it, because I believe that terminating a pregnancy does not hurt anyone. That, to me, is a pretty basic fact. \n\n>overly simplistic\n\nThis is the math person in me. I do believe that morals should be consistent and efficient. The more exceptions you have, the less valuable the morals are. Exceptions can be exploited. \n\n>wacky \n\nTo me it does mean silly and I suppose there is a tinge of \u201ccrazy\u201d in it as well. For example, a religious wacko is someone who is so absorbed in religion that the things they say come off as a but crazy to a \u201cnormal person\u201d.",

Creating a life via IVF is still creating a life even if flawed.\n\n>I look to the humanist part of my philosophy (does this \u201cfeel\u201d wrong?) and combine it with the liberal side of my philosophy (is this logically consistent with other morals?) to reach my conclusion.\n\nOkay so, under the presupposition that an action **could** be wrong if it feels wrong alongside the objectivity of other morals (that is to say we both agree that moral relativism is untrue), then I personally believe, and make the argument that, it is wrong to prevent, by way of stopping after the fact, a natural processes specifically in regards to life, **because** killing or otherwise ending morally complex 'life', is always wrong despite the fact it is sometimes necessary and, as said, morally complex.\n\n>in this specific case is does abortion constitute murder? \\[sic\\]\n\nNo, it doesn't but that is not because it isn't killing or otherwise a form of death. Abortion always results in a death, even if there is no life, because the embryo is in a very peculiar moral position whereby it WILL be alive so by stopping it you are causing a form of death. (Not the same as using contraception, sperm and eggs are a key to a process not the process itself.)\n\n>\"throw those murderers in jail, no abortions, no exceptions!\u201d\n\nWhile it is true that some people make this argument, I think to generalise it so greatly is to strawman a position you don't agree with. Pro-life, even Pro-choice people who attend these sorts of rallies aren't going to be the sort of people who moderately think about these topics, not least like you or I might.\n\n>Which side has the good of society in mind?\n\nI only know that one can't say that an abortion is murder and should be illegal, but one also can't say a foetus has no value and should be disregarded entirely. I personally think outlawing abortion is wrong even despite my own metaphysical argument for value and I want to be clear on that stance.\n\n>terminating a pregnancy does not hurt anyone\n\nGiven what has been established, I think we can both see why the other may not see this in quite the same light. Although, I wouldn't say we have an entirely opposite view on the matter.\n\n>Exceptions\n\nNot an exception, to clarify I really ***hate*** moral relativism which is why I claim that abortion is a nessecery wrong like defending yourself in war is a nessecery wrong. When it is nessecery is a better debate than if it is nessecery, no reasonable person suggests an abortion isn't something nessecery even the body itself terminates pregnancy under stress.\n\n>religious wacko\n\nNot I, though I am theistic I am a non-denominational heretic which I am quite proud of, perhaps that is also why I put more emphasis on a philosophical argument? I don't know.",

I do think and agree that there are instances when abortion is necessary like when it will destroy the mothers life or if there is no chance for survival of the child.  I\u2019m sure there are more as well. But I am of the notion that the underlying situation drastically changes when life is forming inside of you.  I don\u2019t think abortion should be used for convenience. That\u2019s where I draw that line.   I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll regret commenting my views in this forum. Lol. But I guess I\u2019m used to it.  I\u2019d encourage you that if my comments have enraged you beyond words that you pause and try to see it from the Life is life point of view.

You surely will agree that those communities are often much more afflicted by poverty yeah? So getting access to a reputably safe, well-funded abortion clinic is harder. That is an issue in and of itself and should be addressed as quickly as possible. But that doesn\u2019t mean abortions are dangerous, it means that *underfunded, unsafe* abortions are dangerous, and having things like, I don\u2019t know, *government funding* might help clinics provide better care.\n\nBut the reality is that supporting abortion means giving a *chance* (even if it\u2019s smaller than it should be, and again that\u2019s an entirely different issue that equally deserves addressing and fixing) for African American communities to get access to safe abortions, while denying it gives those communities an almost *zero* chance of the same outcome.\n\nMuch like literally anything made illegal, there will still be abortions, and if they\u2019re underground, illegal abortions, they\u2019re gonna be significantly more dangerous.",

The evolutionary biology compels is to have sex.  There is a great payoff, orgasms hopefully for both, but the trick of evolution is to use that as an opportunity to create life.  Many of us are ready for orgasms not all of us are ready to be responsible adults taking care of helpless children.  I\u2019m speaking if the later when I say convenience.  There are multitudes of birth control out there besides abortion that a woman and man can use to prevent pregnancy in the first place.  If you don\u2019t want a child because you\u2019re not ready you can give the baby up for adoption not kill it. Wait I mean the fetus not the baby right?  To mean human fetus is human baby. You can function in society as a pregnant female. Work, play, go to school etc.  women are resilient that way.  And I think it\u2019s absolutely badass. I\u2019m trailing off in my reply now.  But I hope I made it clear about what I meant by convenience.  A otherwise healthy woman that can bring a healthy human child to term should do so because she is a responsible adult who had consenting sex.  If she does not want care for the child then there are pathways to preserve the child\u2019s life.",

Well I believe we are all connected to all of human conscientiousness so I\u2019m essence my consciousness already knows what that\u2019s like.  My current 3d existence may not recall all the details though.  Like I said I am allowed to have boundaries and convenience abortions don\u2019t fly with me.  I\u2019ve explained what I mean by this in previous responses.  And although I love your philosophical spiritually based question I can\u2019t answer fully because it is still hypothetical.  I think that you would understand that there must be a balance in all things in this existence.  So my view point doesn\u2019t agree with yours.  So what?  Why the attachment to my line of thinking? The ego is primarily the reason as it has the need to be right.  I\u2019m not trying to convince anyone that I\u2019m right or that they\u2019re wrong about their viewpoint. I know what fundamentally works for me and what doesn\u2019t.  \n\nBut going back to your original idea.  We all come from    Source. Some call it God or spirit. This source is the highest form of love there is. This love is not judge mental but it wants to experience the whole earthly experience. That includes what we may deem as \u201c bad.\u201d So to answer your question again about what if I had to live that experience.  Well because the real me is pure source energy, I have. Luckily i don\u2019t remember.  None of us do.",

Note: I don't agree with what he says, but I prefer to discuss the point he is trying to make, rather than just mindlessly insult the guy\n\nHe is not saying that \"My body, my choice\" is not a valid concept, he is saying that it doesn't apply to abortions because it's not just your body you are deciding for. To him, it would be like shooting someone in the head and then justify it by saying \"My body, my choice\".  \n\nThen he goes on to ask why \"My body, my choice\" would apply to abortions, but not facemasks. Which is totally a valid question. I assume he thinks facemasks are only meant to protect yourself, so in his eyes it would be ridiculous to use \"My body, my choice\" for abortion when another person is affected by your choice, but not use it for facemasks when only you are affected by that choice.  \n\nAgain, I don't agree with what he is saying, but try to stay on point.",

But what exactly is the point the interviewer is trying to make by correlating these two subjects other than to make the person with the sunglasses look dumb?\n\nIs it that \"my body my choice\" should be respected? In which case wouldn't he be in favor of people choosing to not take the vaccine? I can't imagine he is.  \n\nSo if they work for both, as both parties seem to understand, wouldn't they agree that the vaccines shouldn't be mandatory? (not that it is) And we shouldn't criticize those for not taking the vaccine? \n\nHere's the thing, both \"sides\" are the same, and I absolutely hate that whole line \"both sides have problems\" blah blah blah that people use to justify crappy behavior.  \n\nBut they are.  By correlating these two subjects, vaccines and abortions, both \"sides\" have double standards and are hypocritical.   One side thinks \"my body my choice\" works for Vaccines and not Abortions.  The other thinks \"my body my choice\" works for Abortions and not Vaccines.  They both want to have their cake and eat it to.\n\nThe problem is equating these subjects and acting like \"my body my choice\" should even be mentioned when talking about vaccines.  I get that the \"reporter\" is making a joke and trying to make the man in the sunglasses look stupid.  But by bringing up the subject of vaccines at an anti-abortion rally he's creating a problem that shouldn't exist, and now that it's going viral more people are picking up on it and equating the two experiences when they shouldn't be.",

The abortion thing I get, but my god some of you are full blown nuts. I am going to remind you all, that just because some disagrees with you point of views doesn't make them far right. This is why you guys are going to get destroyed coming November, which I don't revel in. I don't believe the Republicans will save the day but good lord, do you guys not understand the democrats and Joe Biden are so historically upopular not because the entire country is full of racists, terrorists, white supremacists, but because the policies and the talking points you guys have are just awful. Again, I'm not right leaning so I don't want to talk about the rights problems. By accusing everybody else of sucking, and not looking yourself in the fucking mirror, you'll never win anyone over. The more you all double, triple, quadruple, on some things (again not talking abortion here, I get why people are mad about that) the more you guys lose people.\n\nNo, not everybody is a racist terrorist and white supremacists. All the people calling them Nazis, need to open up a history book. I am first generation American, my grandmother is a Holocaust survivor. Moved to the country on a little boat not speaking a lick of English after having her entire family line  shot and buried in a mass grave dug by themselves. My other side of the family, my papa was a prisoner of war for 6 years in WWII. He as well, moved to this country barley speaking a lick of English.\n\nNever ever ever did I hear them complain, they were the kindest most generous people in the entire earth even though they experienced literal hell. They lived under Nazi and Russian occupation. And guess what? They say that none of you have any damn clue what a real Nazi is. You all think January 6th was bad? Try having your entire country burned to the ground with everybody in it. Cry cry cry is all some of you do.\n\nSeriously, the amount of people who refuse to be thankful for what they have, instead they just want more more. I will say it again, I voted blue my entire life, up until  this administration, I don't like Donald Trump, I'm not a right winger and I don't watch any right wing news. \n\nThis administration is so blatantly corrupt, so blatantly criminal, so unbelievably incompetent and you all just give them pass after pass after pass. After George Bush became president I voted blue up until recently, because I thought they were better. Every single thing you guys accuse the right of, is just as if not wayyyy more guilty. You all give them every fucking excuse as to why this country is so shitty. Literally the second he got into office he has been fucking over this country. The inflation, the gas prices, the record crime rates, you all just blame everything but the democrats. They have tried stealing more freedoms and have tried more power grabs in the past 2 years then ever before. I'm just going to say it, I thought Joe Biden would be better than trump, but he's honestly way worse.\n\nSo my honest opinion, republicans and democrats both fucking suck. They both sell us behind closed doors, they both serve greater forces, and are equally trash. Seriously, they have turned this country into a clown show. I have family.membets in 4 different countries. Want to know what they say?\n\nThey talk about how around the world Joe Biden is known for shitting/farting himself and stinking up rooms, they talk about how our country, specifically democrats love pedophiles, they talk about how no where around the fucking world do they try teaching 6 year old boys they can have vaginas, we are known as the weakest country ever just selling our country out. We are known as the only country in the world  who still watches news and doesn't understand it's propaganda. The remaining 35% of people supporting this trash is what is keeping our country down. The rest of the world can see it, most of our country can see it. So how about this, how about everyone puts their differences aside and points them where they need to be, the government and the media. I don't understand how anybody left or right can think our leaders are doing a good job.\n\nSo let's all join as one, let's truly usher something new in. Something that doesn't involve Democrats or Republicans. They both have had their time and both blow. But no, I'll have fun reading everybody ganging up and regurgitating the same non sense. The answer is in front of everybodys god damn faces... everybody can be right and wrong. So I'll end it on this, if you guys are going to continue doing what you're doing, there is only historical losses in sight. And it's nobodys fault but your own.\n\nLast time to get it through everybodys thick ass skulls, I voted blue my entire life. But all I've had is people from the left shit on me more than the right. So strange.",

These people believe there is a second individual not being represented. You may disagree and think that they are endangering the welfare of another by not getting the vaxx, but in abortion people also think people are endangering another's welfare. \n\nIf I found it would save my life potentially if everyone ate a reuben on Tuesday in the capitol building, would I be entitled to others changing their lives to do this on my behalf? Think about it, some people are vegetarian! Or worse, they live in the suburbs! and a taxi to the capitol building is like thirty bucks and a whole ass sheep.

They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.\"\r  \n\r  \n\\-Methodist Pastor David Barnhart",

Against the Nuremberg code or some such right wing talking point fed to him by his controllers. \n\nAnyways, the crazies part is that he legitimately thought that it was equal; that it was her body, her choice with getting pregnant and it was his body, his choice with vaccines. You read that right, it her choice was not about abortion, it was about having sex. \n\nSo in his head it is her body, her choice to have sex, but if she gets pregnant then she forfeits control over her own body because there is another life involved. Buuuuut when it\u2019s his turn and it\u2019s about vaccines, it\u2019s his body, his choice and it doesn\u2019t matter that other lives are involved then, just stay inside if you\u2019re afraid of Covid.\n\nThat level of entitlement and hypocrisy was just too much to believe it was true, but it was. I even pointed it out to him and he denied it and said he was being 100% logical. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe entitlement of some white dudes is so massive it collapses into like the opposite of a black hole. Instead of no light escaping a black hole these dudes end up where no reason, logic, or facts can get in there.\n\nThey really think they\u2019re some god tier philosophers and intellects.\n\nThey\u2019re not; they\u2019re just arrogant and looking to control others.",

Again, not agreeing, but I just don't like seeing reddit get carried away patting themselves on the back before critically thinking this through and contrasting it with their own \"seemingly contradictory\" beliefs. I mean, couldn't the right just as easily characterize vaccine mandates as being anti-Roe?

Neither is relevant to the other. \n\nWhen it comes to vaccines that's 100% a medical decision. Vaccines affect you and only you not anyone else. Vast majority of people don't seem to understand how vaccinations work. When they scream \"yay vaccine mandates \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc9e\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc9d\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc97\"\n\nWhen it comes to abortion it's medical and/or moral. So it can be one or both. According to data shared in the past majority of women getting abortions didn't get it based on medical dangers. They did it because they don't want a baby.\n\nI say if you want an abortion because you don't want the baby then that should be on your own dime. Now if you want one because of medical reasons that should be on insurance. It's not a clear cut subject but it is one that should be had between level headed reasonable people who understand\n All parameters morally, medically etc. Etc. \n\nI do not agree with the notion that people should be able to freely get abortions and kill a baby just because they don't want the child or can't afford it etc. \n\nMaybe more education on the risks of sex and more education on safe sex should be put into place.",

Not the point 2.) Doesn't apply to everyone. Some people can die from the vaccines. Some people can develop long term damage ( this also includes dangers for babies and children) it does not have a factor of decision making on whether or not to take a life. \n\n>Otherwise they're basically slaves, nothing but a tool.\n\nSo there should not be a consequence to a decision? You understand killing a baby isn't the same as removing a bug from your skin right?",

Thats why they let pregnant women opt out! The fact that the vaccine mandates were unconstitutional is just a fact. Ive honestly been on the fence about abortion for a while yes i understand that unwated pregnancy is a huge burden however the left has not made their argument for why taking a life is allowed when like he said there are other routes to go. The argument always skips over taking the life of the fetus pretend it is not a life until it is born which is a religious belief. I feel leaving it up to women to decide is probably right but i dont have a strong reason why.",

It does reduce the chance of infection and the chance of severe effects i.e. lower death rates... by teaching your body how to correctly identify and respond to a virus, think training wheels for your immune system.\n\nSo remaining unvaccinated does run the increased risk of infecting others who may not be vaccinated. This is why you need high vaccination rates for a vaccine to be effective.  \n\n\nIn other words I'm saying that remaining unvaccinated can actually kill someone. And it most definitely has.",

When the Omicron variant emerged during December 2021, case IRRs decreased to 4.9 for fully vaccinated persons with booster doses and 2.8 for those without booster doses, relative to October-November 2021. The highest impact of booster doses against infection and death compared with full vaccination without booster doses was recorded among persons aged 50-64 and \u226565 years.

Your anecdotal evidence of \"but I know people who were vaccinated and got sick* doesn't mean the vaccine doesn't work.\n\nVaccines do not form a protective barrier around you. They stimulate your immune response so that when you are infected your body readily attacks the foreign invader in a more emergent and deliberate way. The severity of the infection is greatly limited. \n\nIt's true that COVID vaccines are 'leakier' than vaccines of things like smallpox and polio, but that doesn't mean they \"don't protect you\" like you claim. There's a very real, measurable protective effect.",

There is no amount of fetuses I would not sacrifice for her. I would even do my very best to kill existing humans if they were threatening her life so\u2026 I would even die myself if it could save her. Because her unhappiness would crush me. My daughter deserves the world. My daughter deserves every possibility to build the life that she wants for herself. My daughter deserves abortions and my grandkids deserve to be born when and if they are wanted. No one should be a slave under strangers opinions on how they choose to live their lives. Especially not when those opinions doesn\u2019t even affect the strangers having them.",

You have to pick one or the other. If you think that not taking the vaccine is your own business, then you can not tell someone whether or not they can have an abortion. If you truly were pro life you would be focusing on saving people that were ALREADY born. For example protest wars, go out and feed homeless people, adopt children, socialize healthcare, and do literally anything else that doesn\u2019t tell people what they can and can\u2019t do because YOU don\u2019t agree with it.",

Also getting pregnant doesn\u2019t happen accidentally, even though people call it an accident. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s pretty difficult to do in fact. Take responsibility for your mistake instead of killing an innocent life. Also the father should 100% have every right to his unborn child. You had sex with him willingly and very aware of what that means. It comes down to this my friend. We downplay sex as if it\u2019s not that big of a deal and we can do it whenever where ever with whomever and not be responsible for anything. That\u2019s the real root of the issue. \n\nGovernment should stop people from killing other people, common sense.",

However, I also know that many teenagers and mainly female teenagers are peer pressured into sex. These people should be more careful period, but they also shouldn\u2019t be forced through pregnancy. Not to mention that many of the people who have sex knowingly and willingly use protection whether its condoms, birth control, etc. which sometimes fail. I believe that abortion should still be an option for these people. Yes they are killing a life and that is something that they will have to live with the rest of their lives. Unless we start reforming adoption as a whole some of the kids that are born  and put into the adoption system have to deal with being molested, knowing their bio-parents don\u2019t want them, and other cruelties that children shouldn\u2019t be forced to deal with, we can not just tell people that they must have the child and put them to adoption if they still don\u2019t want to raise their kid.",

The pregnant teenager at 13 wasn\u2019t due to good parenting. It\u2019s near impossible for my teenage daughter to get pregnant but yeah it\u2019s not 100% impossible but this is not the main issue. Those are few and far between.  I\u2019m talking about the majority of women wanting abortion, who are well past their teenage years, because the child is an inconvenience to their life style and they don\u2019t feel they are responsible for getting pregnant. You sure are responsible and it\u2019s a big deal. Human life is a big deal. Someone has to be responsible and it\u2019s unfair to put the responsibility on an unborn child that never got the chance to defend him/herself. You got pregnant you raise that child and take full responsibility. As you already know I\u2019m not into the government controlling people but this is defending a life. I really don\u2019t have anything else to add and I know you see it differently.",
