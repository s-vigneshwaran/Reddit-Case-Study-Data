  "text": "TIFU by borrowing my wife's laptop and finding her reddit account.\nAs the title suggests I borrowed my wife's laptop for a presentation because it had a full size hdmi port and my chromebook does not, and lets face it the pink case brings out my eyes. I open it up and chrome is open on reddit with her signed in. I know IATA here but I was curious and honestly hoping to find some nudes that we could use later to try and spice things up(idiot). \n\nA little backstory. I am an individual with serious mental health challenges and lately my depression has gotten the better of me and was sucking the life out of my wife. She has told me as much. I never thought I would be winning husband of the year awards but I genuinely love my wife and would do anything for her. I'm probably letting myself of too easy. Anyways in December my wife tells me that she can't handle it anymore and I need to get my stuff together or we're done. I have given every effort possible since then, multiple counselling sessions a week, changes in medicine, changes in careers and feel like I've made solid progress.\n\nBack to my fuckup, I see her profile and notice the most recent post was really highly liked (3k+) and even given an award, Cool! Then I read it. I won't go into specifics because some degenerate will track the post down but needless to say it paints me very negatively. She describes me with very harsh language and this was all brought on by a fight we had that I will admit was not my finest moment. I get upset after reading the first couple of lines and give up, close out of the browser and prepped for my presentation. Later that night my wife notices that I'm upset and asks me what is wrong. I try to avoid the confrontation because we had been doing so well but she persists and I brake down. I tell her that I saw her post and that I was sorry, I had no right to look at her account. I told her I wasn't angry at her for making the post but it did really hurt and killed any self-confidence I had left. In a credit to our couples therapy we talked it out like adults and she even read me the post in full and said that was it. We make up and all is well not good but atleast ok.\n\nAs I'm laying in there in bed something is nagging at me. Something about the way she kept saying that was it made me feel like she was hiding something and lying to me. So I get up and go to the living room and Fuck up again by looking her post up and finding her account. I read for hours, she only had one other post about me but it was fairly generic deadbeat husbands asks me to make breakfast on my morning off(I'm working on not doing shit like that now sorry honey). Then I look at her comments. I get why she lied and said the one post was it, she was protecting my feelings. She hates me. She doesn't think counselling will work. She's just biding her time to kick me out. I am an awful human being with no redeeming qualities. She doesn't enjoy our sex life and feels like it ranges from a forced chore to pathetic and boring.\n\nI plan to talk to her about it. I know I am the asshole in this for reading her shit. This is the love of my life and mother of my children. I have destroyed everything good in my life. Its over. I have no chance to save it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Borrowed my wife's laptop and found her reddit account. She hates me.",

This is particularly true for things they know are petty complaints, or things their partner is actively working on but are still frustrating.\n\n2. The phrasing of these posts matters a lot. \u201cI hate my husband, I\u2019m just putting up with therapy until I can save enough money to kick him out,\u201d is very different from \u201cWe\u2019ve been going to therapy and he\u2019s clearly working hard, but it feels like he\u2019s not going to change and we\u2019re just prolonging the inevitable.\u201d But in a quick summary, especially in an emotional state, OP could be conflating the two. \n\n3. Related to the last point, OP is suffering from depression. Speaking as someone who has suffered from depression for most of my life, and who has an intimate partner and multiple family members with depression, it is very easy for depressed people to spiral when they\u2019re in a vulnerable emotional state. \n\nI have personally broken down into tears over minor disappointments or inconveniences because too much stacked up, and I started feeling like I just couldn\u2019t catch a break and everyone/everything was screwing me. I have also seen \u201cI\u2019m not happy with the way we\u2019ve been splitting household chores lately, I feel like I\u2019m doing the bulk of them\u201d turned into \u201cI get it, you think I\u2019m lazy and worthless and nothing I do will ever be enough.\u201d\n\nGiven how upset OP is, it\u2019s entirely possible he\u2019s spiraling in a similar fashion. The phrase \u201cI am an awful human being with no redeeming qualities\u201d in particular stuck out to me. That\u2019s almost certainly not a phrase she wrote, but that\u2019s 100% a phrase someone suffering from depression would tell themselves.",

The only way to really help him is to not take it personally when he's like that, to be very careful with what I say and try to help him find a way to get out of it again. It can be very frustrating and seem like an endless journey. I've had it myself in a much lesser extend than him, but I know the feeling and I know he also knows that his thoughts aren't exactly right in that moment. There's just very little he can do about it in the moment itself. \n\nI also have to be careful myself as I also become less tactful with words when I'm stressed out, I become angry more easily and it reflects in the way I say things. This obviously plays up in these moments that he's more emotional too and it makes things difficult. I know he loves me too though despite what we say in these moments and we talk it out when we're calm again. It is difficult, these mental issues, but when they're worth it, the effort is too.",

I make an effort when he feels that way to unravel the web by calmly contradicting it. \n\nLike in the example I gave, I would say \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re lazy. You work very hard, I just told you earlier this week that I\u2019m so proud of how well you\u2019ve built your business. This is about chores, not about your character.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019ll do the same for me: \u201cI know this was upsetting, and I\u2019m sorry things are so overwhelming right now, but just take it one step at a time. This is a problem we can solve.\u201d\n\nIt really helps to have someone to get you back on the right track mentally, and I wouldn\u2019t want it to be anyone else.",

I just feel like discussing stuff like that every now and then and it's not at all an attack to him or the ways we do things now. It usually helps him put things in a better perspective and calms him down a bit.\n\nI do have to say it quite often and It just hurts to see him put himself down so much, even though I know he doesn't really feel that way when he isn't having a depressive episode. Well not to the same extend anyway. I hope it gets better with time, he is trying really hard and I am happy with every step he makes :D",

My inner monologue often contains nearly the same phrase. Some variations I've said regularly:\n\n>\"You're a piece of trash\"  \n>  \n>\"I'm a piece of garbage\"  \n>  \n>\"I'm a terrible person\"  \n>  \n>\"I have no redeeming qualities\"  \n>  \n>\"I'm a terrible human being with no redeeming qualities\"\n\nI thought it was interesting that the phrase is so similar.\n\nIt's difficult for me to tell whether I'm accurately perceiving a negative situation or if it's distorted by self-hatred, and I imagine being in a low situation like the OP makes this more challenging. Phrases like that, which are so extreme/absolute, can serve as a tell that it's a distorted thought.",

It could be completely how he sees her feeling but it could just be the actual words she used. If it is just the way he's seeing things then calming down would be the best option. \n\nContinuing to try if it's pretty close to what she said then that's just wasting time they could have been using to move on. Reading the post though it comes off like they could run into each other 10 years from now and she wouldn't reply to a hi from just disliking him but currently the stability and comfort is what makes it worth putting off. Like the entire situation reminds me of a long and immature relationship not wanting to lose what we thought was love even when it got to a point where we were just together for comforts sake, it took over 10 years for her to speak to me and I'm pretty sure all it would take is a few drinks and she'd be ready to slit my wrists.",

Wiped my hands of it. Never looked back. \n\nMy husband (not my ex) isn't perfect. I bitch about him on here but it's nothing he couldn't fix, and it's the not giving a crap about it that really bothers me. I know he's suffering from depression and I just wish he'd fix his headspace and feel better but I bitch about it online because I can't drag his ass to therapy when he's not ready and have it work. He's getting better now but knowing what I do about my own relationship I wouldn't write off OP's relationship just yet. That space between realizing your partner has issues they need to fix and leaving is a whole spectrum, for better or worse. \n\nI'm not her, so who knows.

That's not good communication, ever. \n\nI've been somewhat on-off with my current partner for.. God, 10 years? That's nearly half of my conscious life and I hated her sometimes and sometimes she hated me. But we had our back, even when we weren't dating and now we have a really solid base of understanding for each other and how to navigate tough times. We know how to give the other time and space, when we need it and I couldn't imagine having another lifestyle. I doubt I could ever built something like that, with anyone else, at this point. We have both watched us completely shift our personal priorities, going from teenager to our mid 20s and  now know each other better than ourselfs. Part of that is a lot of dark shit, bc guess what, that what humans go through and anything else is essentially a illusion that will break down, at some point. The real difference is in how you communicate and if you can respect each others boundaries, while still realizing that everyone has needs, but that not all needs can be covered by your partner. And yeah, that includes knowing that there is a limit to everything to not hurl down the cliff at full speed. \n\nMy great uncle and aunt are in their 80s, they spend half year apart from each other and half traveling or chilling, together. They are crazy about each other and I just hope I can have anything like that, at their age. \n\nImagine being stuck in one of these relationships, you can't talk about your feelings bc everything is a drama (mental health is a bitch), but then you get punished for trying to get some distance and getting your emotions out of the system. She had to put up with a lot. If they stay together, hopefully OP has learned a thing or two about respecting boundaries. I mean, wasn't it obvious that she hates him sometimes, given that she contemplated breaking up with him? Stop rocking the boat, you doofus. Should have put some thought in reading the fucking room, keep the focus on changing, not sulking. That's how you got here, in the first place. She hasn't left yet, has she?",

Then he made a post on Reddit for attention.\n\nA good partner is observant of their significant other; they listen and ask questions. They take an active interest in their partner beyond just what their partner can do for them. They consider their partners feelings and needs. A good partner helps without being asked. A good partner doesn\u2019t need to be told to do things as if their significant other is their parent. A good partner is aware of how their significant other is feeling and provides support to help ease any pain or hardship.

Like ok you didn\u2019t make breakfast I on her day off big deal, did she need to complain about it on the internet or maybe she could have talked to you ? I\u2019m not saying either side is right but what I am saying is that just these kinds of situations are really tough to just do you know fix Without some real time apart and not feeling trapped and dependent and stuck in a relationship for various reasons, I just don\u2019t think things will get better. \n\nLike look at yourself op blaming yourself for everything that is not healthy either. Did you breach some trust and snoop around a bit yeah and that wasn\u2019t right but what does that show that also shows the deep down you know deep down you already knew the answers and the response that you gave to blaming yourself for everything just shows your dependency. \n\nIf you can if I were you I would try and just do you know take a break maybe go on a little vacation for yourself clear your head get back to you know you.",

It all depends on how you frame your own happiness in the end.\n\nIt matters what others think, feel, need. OP\u2019s post shows he cares deeply about his wife and family. His post is centered largely around what his wife wants, needs, and is upset about. It\u2019s really admirable and worthwhile that he\u2019s working hard to make changes in his life, despite being hurt, using tools like therapy and improved communication. \n\nChipping through depression (and many mental health difficulties) will highlight the most complicated aspects of relationships with oneself and with others. Some parts of life heal faster than others. Some people heal faster than others. Validation and self esteem can be sourced both introspectively and externally. Each person draws their happiness from within and outside of themself in different amounts at different times.\n\nIt\u2019s good to be inspired, motivated, by the people and things that matter to us. Making changes to become \u201cthe person you want to be\u201d  in addition to \u201cthe person someone needs you to be\u201d should both be considered and weighed out, and not always equally.

And bad behavior. \n\nYour wife can\u2019t help that she feels therapy won\u2019t work, you shouldn\u2019t be mad at her for feeling that. You need to respect her feelings and let her know you cherish them. Tell her it\u2019s okay to feel what she feels.\n\nYou can try asking her why she thinks therapy won\u2019t work though, and why she feels like she needs to post things online.\n\nWhen she tells you why she thinks therapy won\u2019t work, don\u2019t defend your actions, just listen and process with her.\n\nYou need to really ponder her words and imagine yourself in her shoes, and tell her how YOU would feel from everything she is describing, back to her.

He only started trying to work on this for the last two months, since she gave him the ultimatum in December.\n\n\nI've been on this planet for almost half a century, and I'm just saying, I've seen this scenario play out so many times it's mind numbing.

I mean, maybe, but again, that would be super unusual. Women get mad when the guy refuses to ever help out around the house, or with the kids, and sometimes they get fed up enough to threaten divorce even if he makes all the money - maybe that's the case here - but my GUESS, just based on lots of life experience, is that this guy was doing a lot of online gaming, redditing, porn, and not much else.

Mental health is a crap reason for someone to leave someone, by the sounds its only a part of the issue but still, you've found exactly what you need to work on. Eg the sex, ask her what to do better, communication is the most important thing in any relationship. Therapy is shit and doesn't work for everyone. Just speak to her. She shouldn't be protecting your feelings, feelings need to be hurt to improve yourself. A happy go getter doesn't grow as much as a withered depressed piece of shit (what I used to call myself). Let her hurt your feelings to grow into a better man for yourself and herself.",

Hire a babysitter if you can or something like that. I think you both need a bit of a break from eachother. Some perspective. It could end well, it could not. But I think it would be good for you both. Right now I guess you're feeling more depressed than ever, which is completely understandable, but is probably hell for your wife too. If you spend more time close to eachother right now, it's just gonna fester. Kill two birds with one stone by showing your devotion and love to your wife while also getting some space for you both by treating her to a getaway. If you can. \n\nGood luck. All will be alright in the end, whether with her or without.",

As a result, I had to watch out for little signs of anger, and I became sensitive to those. Sometimes it was something as small as the click of a lighter, which meant that he was about to smoke, and smoking meant he was about to blow up if I didn\u2019t control myself down to the way I breathed.\n\nThose small things carried on to the rest of my life. Sometimes, someone speaking in a tone slightly different from their usual sets off alarm bells in my head, and yes, even the small noises they make when they\u2019re engrossed in something. Other times it\u2019s just something so minuscule, like the other person going silent too quickly after a conversation ends. I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019ve done something wrong to make them angry, and I don\u2019t want them to be angry at me. It scares me. So even if it seems really out of nowhere for the other person, I constantly ask, \u201cSorry\u2026 are you mad?\u201d\n\nConstant reassurance goes a long way. I know that I really appreciated it. Just patiently and honestly responding that you aren\u2019t upset, or if you are, the root of it isn\u2019t the other person but this other matter\u2026 it gives a sense of security and assuredness that might not have been present for a part of his life. He might not be able to calm his anxieties down on his own because it eats at him, but a short, simple, and caring response from another person might.\n\nReally wish you two the best, and I hope that things work out.",

But it is also within my partners rights to do what they want - if I\u2019m okay with it then great, if I\u2019m iffy let\u2019s discuss, and if I\u2019m diametrically opposed then we probably shouldn\u2019t be partners.

      "text": "Not quite the same as you, but I came across this Quora post that may help you (I went through a similar thing as the Quora chap). Here\u2019s what he wrote, and I\u2019ll put a link in to it..\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nWhen I first got married, we would be passionate everywhere, if you know what I mean, bed, floor, couch, where ever. We would do things for each other. And we enjoyed each other\u2019s company. She was from Japan I am white american.\n\nI learned to speak Japanese and we lived in Japan a few years and life was good. We had kids together, but over the years things grew cold between us.\n\nThey say that people change and you grow apart. I don\u2019t think either of us changed. I doubt that most people change. What I suspected happened was that I would base my love on how much she loved me and visa versa. If she did something nice for me, I would do something nice for her. Or if I did something nice for her, she would do something nice for me.\n\nThat all sounds fine and dandy, but I think in practice, it doesn\u2019t work. When I do something nice for her, I expect something of equal niceness in return. However, often is the case that you don\u2019t perceive what is done in return is as valuable as what you gave him or her. So the next time you do something, you feel less inclined to do something as nice. And so the love kind of fizzles.\n\nYou basically stop caring because you perceive your partner as not caring. And chances are your partner feels the same way about you. Neither person has changed. They are both the same person, but the love isn\u2019t there anymore. They let it spiral into nothingness.\n\nThat is what my wife and I did. After 20 some odd years of marriage, there was nothing. I really had no desire to do anything for my wife, because she wasn\u2019t going to do anything for me. We didn\u2019t hate each other. We helped each other when needed, but that is about all.\n\nI was unhappy with the marriage. I either wanted out or I wanted it fixed. But after 20 years of marriage, I knew that she wasn\u2019t going to try and fix the marriage. I knew that she thought I would not change so why should she have to do anything special and if I did change, it would only be temporary and things would go back to how they were, so why even try. I knew this would be her mind set.\n\nSo I had 3 options. Divorce, stay in the lifeless, sexless marriage, or take a chance and do something about it.\n\nI thought perhaps divorce would be the better way. Start anew. She had given up on me and didn\u2019t care.\n\nBut I decided to give it a try anyway. I completely revamped my approach. I decided that I would try for one year to fix this. I would not require her to do anything. I would just do these things on my own. If these things wooed her back then she would be back on her own terms and not mine.\n\nSo I did the following.\n\nI committed to get into shape\u2026 better diet, exercise\nI committed to do something special for her everyday regardless of whether we were getting along or not.\nI committed to do at least an additional 30 minutes of house work every day.\nI committed to pay her a sincere compliment at least once per day.\nI committed not to fight with her and to only have calm arguments with her.\nI decided to fix her dinner and breakfast as often as possible.\nIn essence I decided to love her every day.\nAs I thought, I got essentially no response from her day after day. I mean she would sometimes say thank you, but that was about it. After about four months she started to change. I kept at it. She continued to change. Ok.. she didn\u2019t change. She was the same person, but she saw that I was trying. She saw that she was important to me. She saw that I wasn\u2019t giving up. She wanted to be loved.\n\nShe started doing things for me again. We started talking a lot more and doing a lot more together. We started dating again and going on trips. It was almost like we were newly weds again, but with less passion, but it felt great. Sometimes I would just hold her in my arms for 30 minutes.\n\nLove can be revived. It is not easy. True love takes work. Making the decision above to love her regardless was the second best decision of my life. The first of course was to marry her. Our marriage is not perfect, but I look forward to seeing her every day. She is an awesome woman. She is basically the same person I married. We just let our love die. We were lazy lovers. She asked me one day what got into me and I talked with her about my plan. I think it was a pretty good plan and so did she. And yes, we are still married, but much more happily now.\n\nI knew our love couldn\u2019t be one sided, but I also knew it needed to start somewhere and why not me. Ask yourself, why not you? Do you want the love back? what kind of sacrifice are you willing to make to have the love back? If I had decided that she needed to do something while I was doing something, then we would have been right back to where we started. You can\u2019t base your actions on what the other is doing in return. You need to commit to love regardless of what is done in return. That is the sacrifice and that is where real love will begin.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOP - You can still sort this out. \n\n[https://www.quora.com/What-caused-you-to-fall-out-of-love-with-your-past-lover/answers/100414629?ch=17&oid=100414629&share=51f73df4&srid=uefxG&target_type=answer](https://www.quora.com/What-caused-you-to-fall-out-of-love-with-your-past-lover/answers/100414629?ch=17&oid=100414629&share=51f73df4&srid=uefxG&target_type=answer)",

Before I posted the above comment, I had a long personal commentary that I decided not to share. Well, it's still in my clipboard, so here it is, so hopefully it can help some others who have struggled with similar issues.\n\nI have spent most of my life single. I've had devoted long-term relationships but by and large we fell out of love much like the quote suggests. I am actually thankful for this, as this time spent with myself has led to me sincerely knowing who I am, what I want, and what I can and cannot bear. I feel so whole and complete, and I've never needed anyone else to feel that way. \n\nBut still, life gets lonely. So now I know I want a partner, not because I need it, but because I am whole by myself and I desire it. I truly want to share my experiences with someone else. And the squabbles and failures have taught me that takes work. There is no such thing as true love. All love can be true love, but it requires work. If you want something to last, you will put in the effort, and it will last. Or if it doesn't, it will end with you knowing you did all you could. Tinder has made people feel like there are so many fish in the sea, the next one that comes along may be better. The truth is, you could spend your entire life with any one of them. You just have to love them (and yourself) enough to try. Cheers, you filthy animals.",

I\u2019m not unhappy it ended as I have found someone else I love and get to go on an exciting new journey with.

Married for 20 years? Then re-ignite the love? Nah, man. People just split because it's easier to just find something new. You get all the passion, the fire, that comes with a new relationship and you don't have to figure out how to make things work if they aren't 100% perfect.

I met them downtown instead of at their place after work (quite a bit out of the way for me) because they hated taking the subway alone, I hung out and did work stuff at their workshop on the weekends because they didn't like being there alone. I accompanied them to so many doctors appointments to make things easier for them. I didn't leave their side for a week, except for the when hospital kicked me out, when they needed emergency surgery. I did these things not for some return, but because I loved them and wanted their life to be easier.\n\nMy partner did not cook me a single meal in the two years we were together. They never once cleaned my apartment. They didn't ever meet me at work. They didn't come to my appointments. They didn't take care of my parents after I was injured. \n\nHealthy relationships have give and take. People do things with no expectation of getting something back. But, when a relationship is too one-sided, resentment builds and it's hard to see the good in someone who hurts you again and again until you become immune to it.\n\nJust like my experience isn't the norm (no one experience can be), nor is yours.",

I'm a simple man and I'm attracted by words and physical touch. I've always thought it's the same for others, but she on the other hand values quality time and acts of services.\n\n\nOnce you talk through what other really wants to receive, it acts as a guide for yourself to be a better person.",

A pot of water over a fire. 2 cities across a river and a bird. which are you?\n\nWater and fire obviously don't mix but for one reason or another you must work with each other. You need to boil the water to cook that food but without that pot separating the 2 parties, they could not function together. they tolerate each other for the task at hand. While sometimes unavoidable, it's not easy when this is with someone you love.\n\n2nd, are the two cities. the river allows ease of trade. one city imports food. the other imports clothing. both products vital. both cities thrive. great! but what happens when one of the cities stop producing? There's a drought and food production stops. the city of cloth would maybe have the first transaction after the drought be put on credit but the 2nd or 3rd? find a new trade partner, you ain't running no charity! pretty obvious a business relationship. You do right by me and ill do right by you. sounds good at first and many relationships whether business, friends, family or spouse end up like this. it makes sense. its easiest to fall into. (I apologize for getting stereotypical for this but bare with me). the husband comes home from a long day at work and the house isn't cleaned. there's resentment. he worked all day to pay the mortgage & tuition for the kids. he can't even come home to a normal house? what am I slaving away for!! and the wife sees the husband. no greeting. no flowers. no 'i love you'. I raise and care for the kids. I prepare his food. what do I need this for.\nas you mentioned yourself when one party stops contributing the other negatively feeds off that and doubles down and we start a vicious cycle.\n\nLastly, we have the wings of a bird. in order to fly the bird must remain aloft each wing must give 100%, not 50/50. the left wing doesn't look at the right and say its slacking so I'll take a day off too or else the bird plummets to the ground. if one of the wings are not feeling 100% the bird lands and tends and cares for it. lets it recuperate and then once again both wings are 100% all in.\n\nI know this myself and have experienced 'off' days where the kids have made my wife just a little too ragged today or everything went wrong and is on edge today or honestly just 'not in the mood' for me. of course when its a day longer than I care for it hurts, I may feel unloved and in turn feel less love towards her but my \"obligation\" as a loving husband is to love and to care for. through sickness and in health. I do my 'job' and that love will be reflected back towards me",

Now this shines a new light to me that love can be anything that invoke feelings, emotions and you can make it work, using practical means like gestures, speech or small actions. \n\nMy view of movie-like romance and love did drive my relationship to a toxic one, and now I regret that.",

I do think an unintended consequence of the fast-paced, happiness-at-all-costs society we currently experience is that the reality of love as a choice that requires work, sacrifice, and hope, is often lost. Love is never easy all of the time. Some seasons of life are harder than others. Coming out of one of those hard seasons is like a new birth of love. It feels completely different, yet just as exhilarating. It gives you such a deep appreciation for the person who can see your faults and still love you, because you can see their faults and still love them. I can confidently say I love my husband more today than the day we were married, long after I no longer get butterflies when I'm near him. I loved the feeling of butterflies, but I *love* the man. People often get confused because they love the feelings they get, not the person who gives them those feelings. So you're right, a lifelong marriage isn't for everyone. Both parties have to be willing to make it work. Both parties have to choose to love. And it sucks that so many people are in relationships where they want to do the work, but their partner doesn't.",

Remembering birthdays, buying Christmas presents for family, scheduling drs appointments, on top of doing the lions share of cooking, cleaning, organizing. In many cases they probably plan dates and outtings more than their SO. \n\nIt\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s easy to allow resentment to grow when they other person fells they are contributing equally and in reality they are not.\n\nAt the end, it\u2019s not promoting men changing women to revive a relationship, it\u2019s that the renewed effort going in is a signal that they\u2019re not just coasting. They are putting in a visible effort to ease your burden and show that they care about you.",

If you are gen X or younger, everyone is working to support themselves and their families (hilariously enough giving it more thought I do know one househusband in his 20s but he is an outlier). Paying for dates it 50/50, either you split or alternate with your partner - the only times I see a more traditional approach is when there is a large gap in earnings between the two.\n\nI agree, it sucks that men aren\u2019t granted the same privileges as women (but have been used historically to oppress them), and I wish more men would take parental leave when it\u2019s offered by their employer but I would say it\u2019s significant enough that it leads to a decrease in marriage satisfaction for women - to the point that it would certainly be a reason for relationship breakdown.",

Heck, my childhood saw my parents divorce, and my mom divorce a second time. But I believe in marriage. My wife believes in marriage. Our families do. \n\nThe reality is that marriage, and love, is like a fire. You can let it burn hot and bright, but if you don't tend to it and nurture it, it WILL burn itself out. You have to keep it up, add to it, clear the old ashes away so that the fire isn't smothered, and most importantly, you have to want that fire to exist.\n\nThank you for your comment.",

But to further that, in the specific context of a relationship there should be two people putting in the effort. Relationships aren't an us vs them kind of deal, it's a two partners vs the issue situation.\n\nFrom the quora OPs post, which is all the information we have, he's putting her on a pedestal and hoping that she sees how committed he is and maybe, if it's convenient, starts to put that effort back in as well.\n\nThe issue is that there's no broader context. I'm sure the quora OP and their wife talked much more extensively about all of this and it was in fact a team effort. But the issue is that the context is lacking, and on face value quora OPs post is terrible advice.",

I remind myself that I am choosing this, and if I don't want to be here, I don't have to be, but every day I'm making a conscious decision. Some days I'm a little beaten down, but I remind myself that I chose to be here this morning, and if I'm still not feeling it, I can choose to not be there tomorrow. Even when there is a few days where things arent so good, it's easy to say \"I'll see how I feel tomorrow\" than to let it bother me. I just try to live day by day. And much like this post, I'm seeing an improvement in how I frame my relationship to myself, and I'm starting to see a small improvement in how my wife interacts with me. I'm choosing her, and whether she realizes it or not, I think that has created that feedback loop where she wants me to choose her, which makes it easier to do so.",

It's been a long and awful haul and we aren't there yet. We're still long distance due to work options but we talk nearly every day; long friendly rambles, where when he first left I was lucky to hear from him once a fortnight and when my calls were accepted they were short and felt unwelcome.

He saw it while pooping on the toilet lol then he brought it up to me immediately after.\n\nI felt terrible. I explained to him that I always saw Reddit as something of a public journal that I was okay with strangers seeing, but it was just a way for me to get words and thoughts out. It didn\u2019t reflect on how I intended to resolve issues in person. But since then, I don\u2019t mind that he has my Reddit name. Haven\u2019t stopped using it but I believe now in letting him know when something bothers me. It feels disrespectful now to go to Reddit. \n\nI also have a therapist now who I can bounce thoughts off of if I need unbiased help in approaching something in our relationship, and that\u2019s been working way better. I feel like I am learning to communicate a lot more effectively.",

It is possible that venting online is the way she deals with her frustration towards you, giving her the patience and calm to actually deal with you in real life.\n\nYup. When I'm really frustrated with someone or with life in general, I usually go and write about what happened, either on paper or on a computer. I would not want ANYONE seeing what I wrote in there, because it's the meanest, cruelest shit that could ever come out of me. It feels really good to let out all of those negative feelings without judgement or the risk of it being seen (I delete it when I'm done).

This seems like a mismatch in that sense.\n\nI don't think you should beat yourself up and take this to mean that you're a horrible person.

Sleep and diet are the two most important things.\n\nI'm sorry you are going through this heartbreak but don't let it take away your confidence. We are all struggling.

And I mean searching-for-a-divorce-lawyer huge.\n\nI'm not sure, how did it even start. I was in therapy because of my many issues, bipolar disorder being one of them. I was struggling with my demanding job, husband's constant bottling up struggles, worries, feelings in general, being a mom, fighting with everyone about getting my daughter a diagnosis for autism (I was fucking right, of course she has it - confirmed last month), lack of sex in the relationship... The list goes on. I vented A LOT. If someone heard me, he or she would advise me to divorce. My therapist, my friends were all giving me \"green light\" to do it.\n\nThen we went to therapy. For me it was only to help him embrace the fact that it is over, but in general I considered it useless at that point.\n\nDuring the first session I shouted, waved my hands, cried, everything poured out like a huge, disgusting river of resentment. He cried. It was ugly, it was hard, it was just absolutely awful.\n\nWe shouted at each other some more. The therapist kind of moderated what was happening.\n\nThen we started talking, for the first time in months. Suddenly the divorce didn't seem that attractive anymore.\n\nDuring the next session, the therapist basically told us, that spending more money on therapy is pointless, we are great together, his job here is done.\n\nIt indeed was. From that point everything started getting better.\n\nHe still needs his own therapy, and I am pushing him to finally do something with his issues. We are not perfect, absolutely not. We both had - and still have - to work around our differences. But somehow it worked.\n\nOP, it may be the end of your marriage, but it may also be not. She still cared enough about your feelings to not read everything to you. Whatever you struggle with, it's debilitating enough to put a huge weight on your partner and I believe her, because I know how hard I am to live with at times. Go to therapy together, let your wife vent all she wants. You both have it hard. It will at least help to calm down the storm, and MAYBE be a start of healing the both of you - separately or as a couple. You have kids - if you don't want to do this for her, or yourself, do that for them.",

      "text": "Bad interactions with a spouse isn't permanent. Have good communication and ensure that she really understands you are trying to change and that a lot of that has to do with your love for her. Talk to her about what she's feeling and try not to take everything too personally. Her feelings may be brought on by good reasons but it doesn't mean you have to \"have your self confidence shattered.\" Feeling sorry about your actions doesn't mean you have to feel sorry for yourself or shit on yourself. Everything emotional here is fixable. You need to communicate, frequently, your feelings in kind ways, and ask her to do the same. It seems like you have trouble communicating because of your lack of self-worth and self-concept. Work to not give in to the void so much, buddy. I'm sure therapy can help that, but you need to be choosing to be positive as well and not be feeding negative thought processes. A lot of this post is desperately feeding negative self-beliefs. It got worse as you went on. Your life is not shattered, there are just some changes that need to be made on both sides, and you both need to talk about what you need and WHY without insulting each other.\n\nP.S. A bad sex life can change too - fuckin communicate!\n\nEdit: see a lot of people on here saying just cut and run, there's no coming back from this or that you're not the kind of person that should be in a relationship. I'm not intimately aware of your situation but in most situations I would say that is bad advice and deeply unemotive. A partner can seriously help you work through personal issues and keep you accountable to goals. Depression is fed by loneliness - the void. You just need to do work for your relationship with your wife to be one in which you can both grow. This is possible.",

She might have a lot of anger and resentment built up towards you, and her thinking that counseling won't work is probably more about her wanting to protect herself from getting her hopes up and being disappointed. Also, you looked into her private comments that she probably uses to help vent and deal with her feelings. Sometimes we say things out of anger because it's cathartic, and not because it's fully reflective of our actual feelings.\n\nYou need to TALK TO HER, like an adult, not with accusations or anger but just to get to the root of what's wrong with your marriage. And prepare yourself for the reality that it may take her a while to be able to see you in a more positive light again, even if you do everything right from here on out. There's also the possibility she may never be able to fully see you that way again, but you'd be surprised what a marriage can come back from.\n\nDon't spin out, don't fall apart, keep going to counseling and therapy and doing what you need to do to be a better partner to her, and most of all communicate with her and really try to hear what she's saying. I'm going through something similar with my girlfriend - shit - I guess technically my ex right now. Fuck, that hurt a little to realize. It's all pretty new and still evolving. But all I can tell you is not to give up, and it may take time.",

I relate to this so hard because I know the frustration of feeling like you can\u2019t control your own emotions and snap out of it even as it negatively affects your relationships and friendships. And when you\u2019re in this state of mind it can be so easy to focus on holding on to what you think are the things keeping you grounded (your wife and kids) to the point where you idealize them. Don\u2019t forget that you are your own person, outside of your family. You have value in this world. And depression is not the only thing that defines who you are.\n\nI\u2019m not married but I know marriage takes work and there will be ups and downs. But both of you have to decide if you want to continue to work through it. Love is not enough. As hard as it is to think of others when your own feelings are so low, you have to remain present and active with your family. Do new things together so you\u2019ll have new things to talk about. Go on weekly date nights. Do the chores your wife normally does instead. The first step is the hardest, but if you can take that one step, you can eventually take another, and then another. I live by \u201ca journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\u201d And it\u2019s something I think of often every time I feel as though everything is shit and I can\u2019t go on.

But in a similar way I've gone through it from word of mouth.\n\nI was dating a girl that was the love of my life, for almost a decade. Mental health and putting myself down ended up with me burning out at a job that literally had nowhere up for me to go anymore and I wasn't even earning what I was giving that company. She literally bottled it in, and tried to comfort and support me and help me change meds or make doctors appointments and it got dark for us both.\n\nShe went from a partner to my caretaker, and I just shut things out and worked to make money as if that's all the value I could provide was. There was a few other things, but nothing major or of consequence.\n\nOne day, she came to me and she broke down and said she loved me but couldn't do it. She wanted to break up. Something in my head clicked, I knew I couldn't lose her, but it had already happened and I recognized how hard it was for her to do that. I comforted her in it, with a strength I didn't know I had because I could barely be my own person. I told her I understood and I supported her decision.\n\nI moved out a bit later, and left my job, moved back to my parents. Typical \"ah, shit, I'm a loser\" story.\n\nI have a couple close friends that are close to her and I know she didn't tell everyone, but she needed to vent to a couple people and it was hard to talk to them when they knew her side and I didn't know what she had said.\n\nI didn't beg for her back, didn't ask them to tell me anything other than if it was ok, please let me know she's ok.\n\nFast forward, I started really figuring my own shit out. I got new doctors, new meds and I was more cautious about that stuff, changed careers, and we met up as friends a couple times in the process.\n\nIt took owning up to it, willing to do better, and actually doing better and we eventually did reconnect and have been together since. Life throws shit at you sometimes, and we've had some worse shit happen since but we're stronger than ever because we face those things together now and instead of fighting each other we fight problems.\n\nIt's not going to be the same for everyone, but sometimes a break to look at yourself in the mirror and work to do better is the best you can do. I hope things work out for you, no matter what happens.",

It strains you every moment of every day, you lose sleep, you're constantly walking on eggshells, and you're always stressed out.\n\nI hate my boyfriend sometimes, I catch myself daydreaming sometimes about being single, about having a different partner, etc. I write these thoughts in a journal and we have an explicit agreement that this is my dark place, he doesn't see what's in it because it's where I put my most angry, vile, and pissed thoughts and feelings.\n\nI think reddit may be your wife's journal. That's not great, as it's public, but I can understand it.\n\nTalk honestly with her about this, ask how often she feels like she wants to leave you: is it every now and then or is it constant? Because we have moments of weakness as caretakers. We get pissed and hateful sometimes, but we try our best to take it out of us in ways that won't hurt anyone.\n\nIf she's really serious about leaving, it's okay, it's going to be rough as hell, but not everyone is cut out to be in a relationship with someone that is working on themselves. If it does happen use the time to work on yourself and let your treatments help you, maybe one day you guys can rekindle.",

      "text": " I'm an absolute nobody that lurks 99.9% of the time, but I feel the need to write this to you. I want to share with you a similar experience.  \n\n\nI was happily married and madly in love to the woman of my dreams.  We both had great careers in our fields, had wonderful relationships within our community, and just bought a wonderful home.  We of course had our ups and downs, but I always respected her and was so very proud to be the man at her side. We each have our own flaws of course, but you over look those minor things for someone you care so deeply for.  \n\n\nWithin our first 2 months of living in the home, I could feel things were off.  My wife seemed, distant?  I went out of my way to tell her how incredible she was in my life.  She smiled and thanked me, but it didn't feel genuine? When you've been with someone nearly a decade straight, you know when something isn't right. Continued being cautious of my wife's emotions for the next couple weeks until I discovered something. At the time I couldn't comprehend what I was reading.  \n\n\nThe thing is, my wife isn't a redditor.  I didn't discover some post online, her emails, or go snooping through her phone.  I found a hidden diary with pages upon pages upon pages of how much my wife hated me.  She wrote so many specific details about me that shocked me to my core.  It was as if I was living one reality, and hers was an absolute nightmare.  Literally describing every me as a worthless human being, and she couldn't handle it anymore.  To add even further insult to my self esteem, there were many entries describing her longing for her coworker.  She had been secretly talking to him for over two years, and yearned to be with this man. How she was much more sexually compatible, desired him, and loved seeing him every day of the week. Those words are seared into my soul.  \n\n\nIt took hours to read everything. I decided what would be best was to do exactly as you posted above OP, I confronted her, apologized, and said I'd do my best to change for her. In that moment, a light switched on for her.  She realized she was finally free.  The words she had wanted to say to me for years were finally out in the open.  She had a nuclear meltdown, and I honestly can say that wasn't my wife that was screaming.  Just some person I didn't know but was in love with.   \n\n\nShe left two days later, and is still with this man.  They quit their jobs and traveled the country together.  I've been alone since.  \n\n\nIt's been one year since.  Don't be scared to move forward alone.  You'll find strength in yourself you never knew.  I'm sorry about everything that has happened to you.  You have a few choices to make that are not easy.  Good luck, internet stranger.",

      "text": "OP. With all due respect, as someone who has mental health issues, and has dated someone else with mental health issues, and has had a relationship ruined by the bad interplay of that person's issues with mine, you need to stop and chill out for a second.\n\n1) Consider the negative tone of your post, and the emotional place that's coming from. You are using a lot of superlatives, a lot of sweeping generalisations, a lot of assumptions about your wife's feelings about you, and a lot of language that assigns blame solely to you. I'm not going to say that any statement in particular is wrong, because only you and your wife are really in a position to evaluate that, but I want you to come back to this later, take a deep breath, and pretend someone else wrote it. Are these conclusions totally rational, or are they extrapolations? Are they fair to you? To your wife? Or was the purpose of this post to vent emotions and fears rather than to examine reality as it is? Are you spiralling right now, conflating fear and reality?\n\n2) Consider, after doing the above, that your wife may have been in that same scared, emotional place as you when she wrote those posts. Maybe she was posting her worst fears and most repressed emotions, just as you are. Maybe she is even ashamed of making those posts - hence why she didn't bring the first one up even as you two were talking about the other one. \n\n3) Lastly, I do want you to address the worst case scenario that maybe your wife could possibly harbor secret resentment for you, but do it impartially and without attributing blame to yourself. Is it really fair to say this is your fault if she's hidden these concerns from you and from your couples therapist? Why should you be responsible for things she has not given you the chance to address? How can she expect to fix things with you if she refuses to admit that she actually believes they're unfixable? Therapy only works if you believe it can work. If this really is how she feels (see above, I'm not sure it is, but again, worst case scenario) it's on her to deal with it at this point, or at least to be straight up with you and be honest about how she feels. You can only work with the info you're given.",

I heard a lot of \u201cshe\u2019s felt x and that affected me and I feel like a POS\u201d but no \u201cI think maybe she feels x and I should try to better understand her\u201d \n\nYou have a victim mentality. You\u2019re focused on how all of this affects you. How is what you doing affecting your wife? You sound like you\u2019re taking responsibility by being self deprecating, but from this bit of information it feels like you\u2019re not taking responsibility. Being self deprecating is still making things about yourself and still making you a victim. \n\nI\u2019d start with trying to have empathy for her feelings and try to genuinely understand her. Listen to what she says. Actively listen. Often times women will literally say what they want and men don\u2019t take them seriously. She said she would love breakfast on your day off some days. Have you tried that? It will probably take lots of time to make a difference so don\u2019t expect immediate results. But give it some months and see what happens. Then also, she doesn\u2019t like your sex life. Well, many women need to feel appreciated in the relationship to enjoy sex. \n\nStop thinking about what kind of person you are and take some action. \nYou need to get rid of this victim mindset and stop self deprecating and try some genuine self reflection and self work. \n\nI\u2019m not a therapist so take what I say how you will, but this is what I\u2019d say to any friend of mine.",

      "text": "Definitely not great to look through her reddit posts but I don't need to tell you that.\n\nBut I want to give you my perspective on this because I am in a similar situation with reversed roles. My partner has mental health issues too and was in a kinda good place when we met. He was doing well when we moved together and then at some point a lot of misfortunes happened and covid and he's been really struggling. His depression got the better of him and he's had a really tough time. Our relationship struggled a lot too. That's a tough situation for both parties involved. So quite similar to your situation.\n\nBUT never ever would I have turned to reddit and talked that way about my partner. At this point you have two okay options, break up and leave which is totally fine if you can't handle it or you do your best to support your partner. And that means no judgement, lots and lots of communication and work. That's a commitment and a big thing to do. As I said totally fine if someone isn't up to it. But it's your choice to stay with your partner and support them so don't blame them if things don't work out directly.\n\nIt's a long and hard process and you definitely have to change your expectations and sometimes just be the bigger person and do more work or accept that your partner is struggling and can't do everything. Yeah it's annoying when you have to do the majority of the household and it's okay to be frustrated but it leads nowhere if you blame your partner. You just can't expect them to do that all the time.\nIf the disease would be purely physical you wouldn't expect that either and get mad if your partner just lacks the energy some days. And your partner will have bad days too and maybe act wrong of say something wrong. But then you have to talk about it and communicate your feelings. A relationship is a partnership. You are two people who work as a team. When one part of the team can't do something the other one helps out. That's how it should be.\n\nYour disease, and that's what it is, is not your fault and you are not at fault for the symptoms of it. You seemed to do the best you could and try really hard and that's the most anyone can expect from you. Your partner should be proud of the progress you made and not be mad about what you couldn't do yet. You can't just magically cure that and accomplish everything. It's fine to fail sometimes and to be weak or frustrated. In the end you are the one who suffers the most from it.\n\nAnd yeah, either you can do this as a partner or you don't, totally fine but it's never your right to judge your partner for that. If you can't take it then be fair and leave. OP this is not your fault. You seem like a great person who does his best and deserves the support your partner should offer you. Keep on working on yourself and getting back to be in a good place. Please talk to a professional about this so you don't get pulled down. Your wife made a ton of mistakes and should have either long left or communicated a lot more. And even then she has no right to ever talk about you like that. You don't deserve that at all. We are not ourselves when we are sick and what we can't accomplish then is not our fault. You didn't destroy anything at all. Your wife did by talking about you like that and discussing those issues with anyone but you.\n\nI really hope you can find a way out of that and realise that you are a good person and it's not your fault for being sick. All the best for you!",

It\u2019s a terrible feeling, made even worse when you feel everything is blamed on you regardless of whether or not it actually is your fault.  On top of my SO\u2019s, relationships which all imploded due to my anxiety around them and fear of getting hurt which just led to getting hurt. It feels impossible to do chores when one of the hardest things is just simply getting out of bed in the morning. It\u2019s so incredibly refreshing to hear that I\u2019m not the only one this happens to.

Looking not once but twice on private accounts? Trying to find nudes of them without their consent (even if they were taken consensually, procuring them for later use is different)? This whole post feels so manipulative and icky.\n\n\n I see female friends of mine fall for things like this and I just feel bad for them, wish I could explain that someone else's mental health is not their responsibility to shoulder at the expense of their own well-being because \"they feel bad and it's not their fault!\"  Mental health is also not an excuse to be bad to your partner, to burden them with tasks that should be your own, to invade their privacy, or whatever else. I, like many people, have had mental health problems in the past, and I did so much work on myself before I ended up in a serious relationship and married. More than that, I suffered no expectation that others should accommodate me in a relationship for my own issues, I knew I wouldn't be a good partner at that time in my life and didn't try to guilt others in to caring for me because \"well it's not my fault!\" I was never selfish enough or callous enough towards others to expect them to bear the pain I was causing, intentionally or not. I  just hate when I see my friends' lives pass them by as they end up dragged down and depressed because they are caught in a codependent relationship enabling someone else's inability to shoulder their own responsibilities and get the care they need. That's enmeshment and codependency, not a relationship.\n\n\nThis post just screams that he wants a pity party for himself and wants to be excused or forgiven by all of us internet strangers. I don't doubt that he's hurting and in a bad place, but I do see that he's trying almost to pull us in to the role that he undoubtedly has put his wife in many times - the grantor of pardons, essentially.",

You're the most important thing to me and I do anything for you.\"  \n\nDon't look back and just go for it.\n\nThere's a lot of details I don't know.  From a certain perspective I've been a worthless bum for some fairly long stretches of my marriage.  I can acknowledge that.  However my wife has also generally encouraged me, supported me, and most of all was patient and committed.  \n\nIf you have genuinely been a loser lately then stop it!  I know there are so many things that I don't know but it doesn't sound like she's been exhibiting very relationship healthy behavior lately herself.  \n\nI'm not sure my marriage would have survived with a different woman.  \n\nI was married before.   My prior wife was kind of mean.  In the end I learned she ultimately didn't care how I feel.  That was never a priority for her. \n\nMy new wife cares about how I feel.  That makes all the difference.  I think she's more concerned about trajectory than how fast we get there.  \n\nHer feelings and needs come first to me, and my feelings and needs come first her.  That's why it works.   Sometimes that's really difficult.  I have learned what it takes and I understand what it could take in the future.  Regardless of what may come I'm committed to her true needs as a higher priority than my own.  I'm sure as long as she has that same commitment I'll always have love and appreciation for one another.\n\nI hope you get some helpful wisdom from your post.  However, you and your wife would probably be best discussing all these things with each other rather than Reddit.",

Mental health is tough and you both deserve credit IMO - you for making your best efforts to improve yourself, and her for trying to wait until you're in a better place before making a move that she feels is in her best interest. You're trying to improve yourself for her, and she's making a personal sacrifice for you. Now don't strain yourself patting yourself on the back, because going through someone's accounts is a serious breach of privacy, BUT she should be communicating more and not letting things build up and airing her dirty laundry online. I guess what I'm trying to say is don't be too hard on yourself and be with someone who makes you happy, not dependent. Been there, done that, not going back - it fucking blows and nobody deserves that shit. I hope you can make progress for your own sake and remember that your are worth it and deserve to be happy.\n\nSincerely, another person with mental health struggles.",

In that time I do everything: working fulltime in an Management job, earning the money and paying  bills, the house and his car, ensure he is taken care of in the hospital (and its not around the corner), taking care about him, our daughter, his family, my family, household. All that alone. And then you cannot even vent, because he has it *worse.* And you understand it, he did not choose it, you love him. But you also are sometimes are tired and have bad days. And you have no shoulder to cry one, because the parther is *fragile* and you have the role to *function*. I choose it, but sometimes when times are ugly I also would love to seperate just to have a normal live. Between that ugly times we are balanced partners and he is doing his part. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs I read that, she lived with his condition since years and was ensuring that everything is running. But as OP says he is struggeling, maybe she is. And he is also ranting to strangers. So .....  I know depression is ugly and OP is probably not seeing things right.

The fact that they'd gone through marriage counseling and her true feelings still came as a surprise to him meant that she wasn't being honest. Without honestly surrounding the real issues, what possible chance do they have of fixing the unspoken, undealt with issues? \n\nShe's not the \"bad guy\" by any means, but her approach is one that will lead to failure. They can't fix problems that only she knows about. \n\nHer marriage counselor would likely tell her the exact same thing.

But making a post to specifically shit on your spouse or anybody you care about really on a public space to strangers where they can't even defend themselves is just unproductive, unhealthy, and toxic imo for multiple reasons.\n\n   Partners are just that, partners. Every individual failure and success in a partnership is a win or loss for both partners. If you're shitting on your partner you're shitting on yourself. \n\n   I feel bad for my friends / family in relationships that think it's healthy & normal to argue in front of other people, to think people think it's okay to shit on their partners over the internet is even more baffling, that's your partner for gosh sakes. \n\n  If you need to vent about something you're spouse did, then imo it would be more productive to vent directly to your spouse regarding exactly whatever it is they are doing. That's the only way anything will improve, communication. And if you're partner is in a state where it's easier to bitch about him on reddit then to just have a face to face about any given issue then you're partnership deserves more honesty and respect for both of your sakes. All posting about them on reddit will do is fuel the fire for your heart with more negative emotions and thoughts, it's functionally impossible to get any worthwhile productive feedback when all the context commenters have is your side of the heated story with none of the nuance of your whole relationship.",

You can't go down the path of trying to convince her to like you. \n\nImprove yourself. Do it for you. Allow yourself to find things about you that you like. Write them down even. Add to the list and don't be afraid to start with small things. \n\nWhen you identify things you don't like about yourself, make a plan to address them in small increments. Old habits are hard to change into new good habits, so do it bit by bit. Praise yourself for every small thing you do. Derive a sense of accomplishment for every baby step you take. Make sure to give yourself praise for them! \n\nPretty soon you will be praising yourself (and meaning it) way more than you thought possible, over real and meaningful things. \n\nYou have a potentially very rewarding journey ahead of you, friend.

Start talking openly about what you both need and what you want out of your lives and relationship moving forward, if anything. If it's ending -- what do you want that to look like. Would expressing to each other what you appreciated about the relationship be worth the time? Would it be worth it to talk about and process the separation in couples therapy as it happens?",

And instead of taking this as a taking stock moment of actually getting the exact list of shit you need to work on (dear god I would love that) you\u2019re hear looking for attention.  Fix your shit.  If you didn\u2019t know this is how you wife felt 1) now you do 2) you should accept that your wife feels this way and probably has been trying to tell you for years 3) realize she\u2019s still with you and as long as that\u2019s the case you have a chance and you should be trying to get her what she needs before she realizes she needs it.\n\nOne thing I practice is HALF Communication.  This system has basically fixed communication with me and my wife.  \n\nHonest: be open and honest.  Don\u2019t hide a single fucking thing you little sneak.  Lol jk but not really.  Be fully open with her and yourself so neither are surprised by situations.  \n\nAcknowledge your wife.  Talking with someone requires you to acknowledge & respond.  That means you\u2019re first sentence should acknowledge and mirror her statement.  Your second sentence should be your response.  Don\u2019t mistake your response as any form of acknowledgement.  It usually isn\u2019t.  \n\nLove your wife.  The easiest way is to choose your words with love and care.  Don\u2019t say or do triggering shit for her.  Don\u2019t be a putz and ask her for shit you can do yourself.  Do it yourself and then do it for her.  Fuck. Do it for her and then do it for you.  Need water?  Ask her if she\u2019s thirsty.  Want a shower? Ask if she wants one.  Want some downtime to yourself for 30 minutes? Make sure she gets hers first.  \n\nFollow through.  Dear god if you say you will do something fucking do it.  The easiest way to break someone\u2019s trust is to not follow through?  Did you agree to take out the trash?  Do it right away.  The world is open to do-ers and do-ers do. Say what you will do and do what you say you will do.",

I vented about how hard it was raising two toddlers while going through university, but barely said anything about her in it at all outside of a few arguments we had. What really pushed her over the top was me telling a story about how I got taken to a strip club as a surprise during my bachelor party 8 years prior and not telling her about it. I didn't do anything but normal strip club things (a lap dance and them putting me on stage to get hit in the face with an ass), but she just automatically assumed going to a strip club meant fucking a stripper and kept saying I was lying about it when I said that stuff doesn't actually happen. I didn't even ask to go, it's just what the guys planned for me. I was so trashed and don't even like strip clubs to begin with, it wasn't even a thing to me.\n\n\nEventually this led to more arguments, more snooping, more distrust and eventually the divorce. So yeah, reddit ruins marriages apparently.",

In hopes of showing you that you aren\u2019t alone, I\u2019ll disclose that I also have a mental illness and a similar thing happened to me a few months ago. My boyfriend (now ex) made a post on here to help me sell some things. I couldn\u2019t remember the name of the subreddit he posted on, so, I went to his profile to find the post. Oh, I found the post alright, and I also found lots and lots of comments on other subreddits trashing me and our relationship. The one that I\u2019ll never forget was a comment he made about how he thought I was \u201cskating through\u201d therapy. I\u2019ve been in therapy since 2015, every week, unless it was a holiday and the office was closed. It hurt A LOT to see that, and it also really pissed me off. I HAVE tried hard and gotten A LOT better. I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019m not perfect, and have some flaws, but he didn\u2019t see the REALLY hard times and how low my depression had taken me. I\u2019m sorry your wife said those things and you saw them. I know it hurts, but don\u2019t let her tear down your progress. I hope the talk goes well and, no matter what, you continue on a healthy path of healing.",

Today, we have things like Reddit where we can more or less anonymously share our deepest feelings to an interactive audience. My point is you were not meant to read those posts and comments and maybe it was just her way of processing her feelings, the same way a diary is used. Is the situation great? No, but don\u2019t go beating yourself up about it. Life is tough, marriage is tough, marriage with mental illness is tough. Maybe this was just how she was coping. Don\u2019t take what she wrote so literal. So she vented on the internet? Big deal, basically the entire population does. Don\u2019t worry about it. Work on yourself, work on your relationship. Stay positive.\n\nAlso, another point, don\u2019t go through her stuff. It\u2019s not healthy in any relationship for someone to look through their spouse\u2019s phone, email, Reddit, whatever.

Not to be mocked or made fun of by the one person in the universe who is not supposed to do that.\n\nA real spouse doesn't do that.\n\nThey don't talk trash behind your back, misled you or play emotional games with your heart. If they do? They are not for you OP.\n\nThat includes talking trash online. \n\nThat is not respectful, that is not honesty, that is not commitment.\n\nShe saved you a nightmare Op, atleast she didn't ambush you with a new douche bf.\n\nGet out Op while the going is good and best of luck to you.",

Perhaps it was meant to be. For me, my spirituality saved me. I have serious mental illnesses, too. I was the one who left my husband, but I\u2019m not happy we had to part ways. Nevertheless, it turned out to be the best thing for me. My relationship with God has turned into something 100 times more fulfilling than my marriage ever was. I\u2019m alone now, (by choice) and I find that I feel less alone living by myself than I did when I was married. \n\nYou\u2019ll get through this. Just keep doing the next right thing. Everything will get better. It might take years, but they will.",

I am married to the best woman on the face of the earth, honest, straight forward, with no deceit at all.  In the depths of my depression, this is exactly what I believed of her.  It's like you're reading a transcript of my conversations with her.  I thought she was going to leave me.  I thought she was having an affair.  I literally fell off a cliff, into an emotional abyss.\n\nAmong other things, I was reading WAY TOO MUCH into some insta posts.  You probably are too.  She married you for a reason, and she's stayed with you since.  She might be tired of your shit but and there's probably more than a grain of truth in her reddit post, but you already know that.  You know you're not right.  You know that it's affecting her and you want to change so it stops.  These are all good feelings.  They're non-selfish.  You apologise in an anonymous post, for goodness sake!  \n\nYeah you've done an arsehole thing, but your brain isn't working properly at the moment.  It's disturbingly common and fucking difficult when you're in it, but it is not permanent.  You can get better.  \n\nThe dynamics of every relationship are different.  \n\nI can't give you specific advice.  \n\nBut I urge you to keep a couple of things in mind:   \n\nShe loved you enough to marry you, and have children with you, and stay with you through your struggles. \n\nAnd things people say on reddit aren't the whole story, sometimes it's a safety valve.  Sometimes it's a partial truth.  Sometimes it's just a way of venting some feelings that can't be aired otherwise without hurting someone you love.  And Reddit advice often sucks.\n\nBut also that your feelings are valid.  Some of those things you describe are relationship things- your sex life for example.  She has some work to do as well to repair things.  But she knows you're fucked-in-the-head at the moment.  It's probably not the first time she's had to forgive you for something.  There is hope.  \n\nGet outside.  Go for a walk.  Endorphins from sunshine and exercise literally saved my life (wife).  It sounds like you're a decent person.  GOOD LUCK OP.",

A year from now you and your wife might have an entirely different (positive) outlook on life as compared to now.  There are good times and bad times in a marriage this is normal, its how you both work towards getting back to the good times that matter most right now.  It sounds like you made progress in building your self confidence and being happy, dont give up on that! maybe she isn\u2019t making the same progress as well and wants to blame you as an easy way out instead of putting in the work needed towards a happy marriage, find the good qualities in each other that make the marriage worth it.  It\u2019s easy to do what your wife was doing on reddit but its unhealthy. Sex is important and that can easily be improved upon by communication in the bedroom.",

I doubt the breakfast thing is the only issue that she's talked to him about and even with that one, it sounds like he's begrudgingly \"trying to work on it\" just because he has to and not because he realises how that kind of behaviour affects her.\n\nOP sounds like somebody that catastrophises and gets stuck in their own head. That can be frustrating for a partner, especially when they are so in their own head that they can't give anything back to their partner. I think if OP loves his wife, he should think about the things she wrote in the post and what they say about him as a partner. Work on it in therapy with his partner, not on reddit.",

They makes posts like the ones you read knowing it's anonymous and knowing their partners won't read it. It's a coping mechanism for many people to talk out their harshest feelings and reflect on them. It doesn't always mean they really think these things. It doesn't look great for your relationship but you're the one who invaded her privacy and saw things that were never intended for you to see. You've never said \"fuck that bitch\" after she's left you pissed off? Did you mean that? Typically that really translates to I love you so much it's difficult to even argue with you cuz I just want to love you all the time. It's really actually possible she was doing this. So maybe you should take it easy and give your wife the rope she extends to you as well right? I'm sure she would get the entirely wrong impression if she saw your thoughts laid naked right?",

For a relationship to work is can never be 50\\50, it needs to be 100% for both no half measures.\n\nShe left the laptop with the page open knowing you could find it. I believe it was to push you to a breaking point to get the blame off her for her own guilt. She married you knowing full well if your issues and still signed on and even had kids with you. She needs to accept responsibility as much as you in the relationship and put 100% into it, from my limited understanding, it doesn't seem like she is.\n\nNone of us know you or the whole situation, but from my experience, I recommend always approaching an issue as a 3rd party. Look at her grievences first, then yours, and try to find a mutually beneficial path. Think of your marriage more like a business that you need to keep running to survive, think logically first and emotionally second.\n\n#Always remember your needs are as important as hers.\n\nWish you all the best man and hope you guys work it out.",

Making a fucking TIFU post before having cleared everything with the wife. He claims he has destroyed all his life and comes on to reddit to post? Really? While not even having a concluding conversation with his wife? I obviously don't speak for everyone, but this is when he needs to go to therapy, not reddit. To me, this all sounds like the same shit his wife did on her Reddit account to piss this guy off, just gaslighting each other.\n\n\nWife:\n\n1. Despite apparently hating the husband, made an effort to protect the husband's feelings. Although this is a gray area because should you be completely honest with your husband even if it will destroy him? Or are you allowed some white lies to protect his feelings?",

That your feelings, wants, dreams, etc haven't been minimized by her or for her benefit? Can you say that unequivocally that everything in your relationship that is wrong is because of you? \n\nI bet not. I bet you've fallen victim to the other side of toxic masculinity. The side of the coin that is where we've been taught all our lives how to treat a woman, and she's been taught how we're supposed to treat a woman... Not how she's supposed to treat her man. \n\nI bet there are wants, needs, and dreams of yours that haven't been met in this relationship either by her or by circumstance. Men don't do counseling or medication if they can't understand that something is off. Medication can also mess up your sex life too, depending on the meds. \n\nWhen a person gets the way that your spouse is being, it's because they're hurt, don't know how to handle the hurt in a healthy way, and then finds an outlet that they think won't hurt you. All it's doing is hurting the relationship worse. If you'll take a step back, find the disrespect in other areas of your relationship, then I'm sure you'll be able to look at this a little more objectively to understand that the failure of a relationship is never just on one person.",

You deserve to be in a mutually loving relationship but first and foremost you have to love yourself. Heal yourself. It will be a long journey, believe me, I know, but you have to give yourself this chance. You won\u2019t have a good relationship with someone else until you have a good relationship with yourself. Look, I\u2019m fighting depression too and I still don\u2019t have an 100% good and healthy relationship with myself, but I do love myself more than when I started my therapeutic journey. It\u2019s been a journey of self-discovery, change and self-acceptance. Think of yourself now. The one who matters is YOU, now. Be selfish. Let go of her and fight for you. I believe in you and I wish you the best.\n\nEdit:  I take the first thing back, I can\u2019t tell you what to do in regards to this relationship - divorce or attempting to fix it - no one here can. It\u2019s a decision only you can make (if she doesn\u2019t decide to end it first), but a decision that must be made. Don\u2019t push it to the side, think long and hard on it and DECIDE. Making a decision (and committing to it) is often the most difficult part.  Both of the options will have harsh consequences, but you must decide. Again, I believe in you and I wish you happiness and improvement.",

They're venting, they're letting off steam, they're not necessarily sincere.\n\nWhat WILL make you insufferable is if you just get even more upset about it.  I'm sorry to be blunt but there's no way around it.  You either have to find a way to not let this affect you, or your reaction to it will only make the situation itself worse.",

All day today I've been bitter and resentful towards Reddit because of all these 'wife' pics, because I have been trying to find a wife for many years now and it hasn't happened. But I guess being with the wrong person is way worse than being alone. I know you probably feel devastated right now. But you are not a bad person, and God has a plan for your life. Try and keep your chin up. Your wife is not the arbiter of your reality. You might have some painful times ahead but you will make it through and find someone who appreciates your good qualities.",

Depression is a very VERY debilitating thing and the fact that you even went to a councillor is already admirable.\n\nI'm really sorry that this is what your life with it has lead to and I feel this post very deeply.

But we can't ignore the fact that it's not the case for some others. I've even given the example of reactive depressions that can very deep but can last 6 months and then there's no more symptoms and they don't come back even after the treatment has been stopped. And it can be one isolated episode in life. Some people can experience it that way. But It's like we don't live in the same world when I read the link you sent. I don't know it it's a understanding/translation matter but for me \"cure\" is like \"gu\u00e9rir\" in french and this is the word psychiatrists use here. And they say that there's the remission phase and then the cured phase but only after 4-6 months without symptoms and treatment. There are many studies about that and the reference book like the DSM-5 says this. \nBut when we talk about a very deep and chronic depression(major depression I don't know if we say this that way) ...I feel that it's a bit different of course.",

Consider meeting a lawyer and explain the situation, and take their advice. Make sure you explain how difficult it can be to take action, so they are able to advise you the simplest way to go about it.",

Her interpretation of it's 47 entries was that I hate her. This was 100% untrue.

She deflected that by turning all the blame on me. \"Oh, I get it now. You hate me!\" She learned nothing about herself from that journal. All she took from it was more things to criticize me about.\n\nOP, if possible, try to see yourself in your wife's comments and try to forget what you now believe she feels about you. You're probably amplifying it incorrectly and focusing too much on the wrong pieces.\n\nGood luck.",

I am not excusing anything that was said about you - especially considering you didn't share any specifics - but the words you read are not necessarily how she feels and could honestly be incredibly far from the truth. She may have been seeking confirmation from strangers as a quasi-permission slip to feel the way she feels, and by embellishing the story/words/feelings, she is much more likely to get the confirmation she seeks. \n\nI don't condone speaking ill of a significant other for karma, I just want to possibly add a bit of doubt to the reaction you are having to her words. You have every right to feel the way you do, as does she, but neither of you will never truly know how the other feels unless you communicate in person.\n\nShe wrote a narrative, likely peppered with (if not full to the brim with) exaggerations for the sake of reassurance via unbiased strangers. You invaded her privacy and breached her trust. Expect a harsh response for that invasion and give her time to process it before you start pressing her for an explanation as to why she said the things she said. Regret and anger are like oil and water and she will likely be incapable of experiencing - much less expressing - any regret or even conveying her true feelings while she is still coming to terms with the fact she trusted you with her laptop and you took the chance to not only invade her privacy but, by your own account, were expecting her to have shared nude photis if herself in secret.",

Sorry, I'm not sorry but I don't have any respect for people who do nothing but talk smack behind you to everyone else but be nice to your fave while they bide their time to get positioned into the perfect  \"peace out\" moment so they don't miss a beat and leave you their holding the bags wondering wtf happened.",

I've gone through it from both in a relationship, out of a relationship, and with my current wife. There is no doubt about it. \n\n2) As much as mental health hurts you, it hurts your wife too - yall are in this together. What helped me the most was having her by my side and supportive. There were times I had to realize that I took things out on her and she didn't deserve that, there were times where she learned that I was having a tough time and just needed her support. At the end of the day, she was my rock when i was in a hard place. \n\n3) It sounds like she takes it out on you that you are going through this, but for things to get better, she is going to have to realize that you need her help. Have that talk with her, let her know how important she is to you and that you are with her 110%. That you will work to do better, you will strive to do better, but that YOU need HER to be there for you. When you need it most, she needs to see that. It may suck, it may be hard, it may be tough, but having that support is a major key in helping overcome depression. \n\n4) Figure out your triggers of depression and talk about them with her and your counselor (sounds like you're doing the back half of that already). I've found that to this day my depression still is there, but I know the triggers, and I know where the anxiety comes from. \n\nLastly - stay strong, be the best you can be, and do it FOR YOU. Your wife is a huge part of your life it sounds like, but remember... it is YOU that is overcoming this challenge. She has to accept to be a part of that team, and it could suck, but maybe that isn't what she is up for. Not saying that is going to be the scenario here, as that is worse case, but do what makes you happy and power to be there for yourself",

The last line was right there on the screen \n\n\"Let's go out tonight and get you LAID! I know you've been chatting up that cute bartender chick. You're live-in POS is working a double tonight. There's no reason you can't take her home.\"\n\nSo obviously I couldn't stop myself from reading the rest. Turns out she HATED me, felt like I tricked her into a relationship and then became a different person. Was just using me to pay for her schooling and then she was out. And that her and her best friend have brought girls home from the bar to hook up multiple times. \n\nShit fucking broke me. \n\nI called in sick to work and waited for her to get home. Sadly she didn't end up pulling the bartender home with her, that would have been a great scene. I had made her a nice dinner to come home drunk to. So we ate and had a super polite awkward conversation at 2 in the morning. \n\nThen I told her I knew everything, I was cutting off her school funding, we were done, and she needed to move out. \n\nShe wound up sticking around for 3 months because she couldn't find housing, and honestly things were getting better, I was very close to giving it another shot. She went out of state to visit family for two weeks. Never called or wrote. Didn't say anything to me on the drive home from the airport. Got home, packed her stuff and had a friend pick her up. I'm not sure what happened on that trip but it must've been good.",

Alot of people on here are of the opposite school of thought so I just wanted to give you another viewpoint from a fed up wife. Being angry and saying hurtful things about him helped me protect myself at the time. It was a way to cope with an unhappy marriage and a spouse that wasn't in a place to make changes.",

I went to counselling for years, I was on anti-depressants for years, nothing worked.\n\nBut I got cured.  If you want to know about the program that cured me, message me.  But for everyone else, if you eliminate risk factors for depression from your life, you can make serious progress in fighting depression.  What risk factors?  Sleep deprivation, poor diet, lack of exercise, living in an environment with stale air, lack of sunshine, drug use, indulging in melancholy and pessimism, and pretty much everything else related to being healthy.\n\nDon't give up on the love of your life so easily.

She was sexting multiple people, planning to leave me, discussing telling me it\u2019s over, and so on. The thing that hit me the hardest was just how many people she was flirting and sexting with. Nothing was done in-person but on the phone and voice chat. Maybe video chat but I don\u2019t recall. Sometimes she would be sexting a guy while sitting right next to me on the couch.\n\nI had been depressed and pretty much doing nothing but working and playing video games. I spent the weekend cleaning the apartment and going for a lot of walks.\n\nWhen she got home I confronted her. It was rough but we spent a lot of time discussing things. It was obvious that she wanted to make it work and we were able to get past it. Now obviously I\u2019m oversimplifying things here, partly causa I\u2019d rather not rehash all of it my head, but we came out the other side better. It\u2019s coming up on two years since that all went down and we\u2019re solid.\n\nYou have to step back and ask yourself what is best for you. There\u2019s lots of people out there that you could be with so don\u2019t get it twisted that she\u2019s your world and you have to have her. Do what is best for you. If you really want this, you have to communicate openly and honestly. She has to be open and honest. If that doesn\u2019t or can\u2019t happen, you have to walk away. I was very lucky. It\u2019s rare that a relationship can come back from this sort of thing. I\u2019m glad I stuck it out but if I\u2019m being honest and it happened today, I wouldn\u2019t. I have more respect for myself now.",

Fuck, man. You're going to counseling, you changed your job, you're trying different meds, you're putting the work in and she still says shit like this behind your back? \n\nMy point is, don't put all the blame for this on yourself. I've been there, and it just does more damage, while not being true, no matter how much you think it is. It takes two to tango. If she says these kinds of things about you behind your back, is that really someone you owe such dedication to? \n\nI wouldn't feel bad about finding the post. I'd demand a fucking apology. Not just saying you're a terrible husband, but for not having the balls to tell you how she really feels, the way that a responsible, caring partner should. Someone invested in a relationship lays problems out on the table to solve them, not hide them and simmer about them on reddit. She's not being a responsible partner, and that's not on you. If you're doing the work as you say, you're doing your part to make it work. She doesn't sound like she wants to hold up her end of the bargain. She just wants an excuse to get out while making you look like the bad guy.\n\nThis is what you need to talk to her about. You're not, at minimum, the only one to blame for things falling apart, if that's where it's going.",

Sometimes people just want to vent into the void, it doesn't mean that they really think those things deep down, they just want validation for feelings they are having in the moment. Don't worry about it, don't bring it up, and try to be a better person, and all of the complaints she had in the past will be just as quickly forgotten.  Use the complaints you saw in order to do better in the future, and not repeat them and your relationship will blossom. Don't bring it up, don;t talk about it, just secretively fix yourself and surprise her by basically reading her mind, and knowing what she hasn't been liking, and changing those parts about yourself.

The difference is he wasn't willing to get his shit together and do the hard work to get better instead he did things to avoid any issues within himself and us. If this is a relationship you feel worth saving stop focusing so much at what she has said in the past out of pain and frustration and focus on bettering yourself and loving yourself! The rest will fall into place if its meant to be. The hardest part is being alone facing your thoughts so make sure your therapist gives you tools to help when you start overthinking and talking down on yourself. We are the people we chose to be and if you chose not heal then chances are you become those negative things you/your wife says. Please don't give up on yourself and continue your healing to get your shit together and loving yourself first so you can be the man your wife deserves. If you want some tools that was very helpful to me message me and ill send them to you. Praying for you OP!",

      "text": ">Then I look at her comments. I get why she lied and said the one post was it, she was protecting my feelings. She hates me. She doesn't think counselling will work. She's just biding her time to kick me out. I am an awful human being with no redeeming qualities. She doesn't enjoy our sex life and feels like it ranges from a forced chore to pathetic and boring.\r  \n\r  \nI plan to talk to her about it. I know I am the asshole in this for reading her shit. This is the love of my life and mother of my children. I have destroyed everything good in my life. Its over. I have no chance to save it.\n\nNah you did not fuck up. It was luck you did. I know Reddit hates this view, but generally it's only bad to look through their personal stuff (posts etc) If you don't find anything worst than the action. You found worst things. Let me point out the red flags and issues.\n\nOn a side note it looks like your self esteem is destroyed, I am sure she didn't help it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) She lied to protect herself, not you. She is mad that you found out, not that you did it. \n\n2) She does hate you and probably puts all the blame of anything happening in her life all on you. That's now how it works. It's rarely 100 percent one person's fault. \n\nDoes she have trouble admitting she is wrong, more than normal? That is classic Narcissist behavior. I recommend you look it up and compare your experience to what she does. \n\n3) She is lying in counseling, a HUGE red flag, and being dishonest to you and the counselor. \n\n4) Which is why she is hiding it because now she is just using you and lying to you. \n\n5) I am sure you have a lot of redeeming qualities. \n\n6) She should have been honest about your sex life and work so it is better. Again no effort and only blaming you. \n\nShe isn't a catch. Both of you need to see individual counseling. When it seems this one sided, and go ahead and talk to your counselor, the issues are also with the other individual. \n\nYou made changes, you're working on it. She is not because she believes she is perfect and has no issues. Yet she committed acts in a relationship like gossiping to public, hiding, lying, and taking advantage of you that are just as bad as cheating.  \n\nYou're probably not the best person, you need to change and get better. You're working on it. She will have difficulties because she fails to see any issues with herself. She also is emotionally abusing you. It's a commonly ignored form of abuse.",

Instead of sitting there saying all those negative things about yourself, try your best to remember the good things in you. \n\nDepression hits everyone differently, and this may be a strong opinion so no disrespect, but I would NEVER vent to people that I didn't know about the people I love in a negative manner. If they are doing that, I don't really feel like there is much you can do. Imagine the things she have said to people she knows about you and your situation? Do you cheat? Do you beat her and the kids? If the answers to those questions are no then it sounds like she doesn't deserve you or isn't a strong enough person to deal with your flaws (remember the part in sickness and in health?..yeah).\n\nWhen I read some of the things my old significant other said, as much as I tried I could never really get over it while I was still with them.

There's so much I could say in an attempt to help you see/feel things in a different light, not necessarily to make you feel any better, but rather, to help guide your thought process. Ultimately, I can only say this, the road goes both ways, it's not up to one or the other to make things work. You say you're doing your part, but she has to participate as well in bettering herself. If she is unwilling, unable, or just refuses to do so, that's on her. NOT YOU! And if that's the case, you're just going to drive yourself crazy trying to fix everything and getting nowhere. I know all too well the struggles of depression and the inability to believe in self-worth. So no matter what happens keep your eyes and mind pointed in the right direction. If she comes into the kitchen on day screaming and yelling, let her. Stand there and listen. NO matter what she accuses you of, no matter what names she calls you, no matter how hard she tries to get a reaction out of you and makes you feel like absolute dog crap, just continue to listen. If you must respond, do so in a calm way. Don't be a smart ass, don be bitter, just yes, no, I'll try, I'm listening, stuff like that. And when she's finished and walks away, I promise you she's going to feel terrible about it pretty quickly. When we fight, we intentionally try to get negative reactions out of people in an attempt to convince us that our hate/anger is justifiable. When the person we're trying to hate doesn't respond negatively, it throws the whole thought process out of whack and makes it easier for those who are doing the yelling to see their actions differently. So, Like Sam Jackson says in Pulp Fiction, just \"Be cool\". I know it's easier said than done, just try your best please. And know when to walk away. Not just from a fight, but from the relationship. I hope you guys work things out! Good luck!",

I was with someone who I thought was my soulmate during one of my worst periods in life, and I was barely functioning. I went to work everyday, maintained everything, but my passion for life was not there. The one thing that kept me going was my love for my significant other.  \n\n\nAnyhoo, she was supportive in the beginning, but eventually she became tired of it. I can't blame her, I was lethargic and gloomy after work, often brooding by myself trying to keep bad thoughts at bay, but I was trying my hardest. She also suffered from some stress related anger management issues, so our problems weren't the best match. She started speaking to a therapist to supposedly deal with her own issues, while I would as soon as I could find the time and strength for it.  \n\n\nProblem was that, as I found out later, she simply started to use this therapist as an echo chamber for her own fucked up exaggerated complaints about me. I know this because she exaggerated everything so much she actually believed some lies she told herself (*she started thinking we had been a whole year together longer than we actually had, she misremembers multiple occasions that other third parties completely disagree with her on, etc etc etc*)  \n\n\nSo this therapist was nothing more than her little echo chamber of complaints. He was constantly assuring her and telling her that these things are bad and I am bad, yet she was exaggerating and lying. It was nuts. Eventually she left me, and found someone else just a month after.   \n\n\n***Reddit posts are the same. Your wife is doing the same. She just wants reassurance she is in the right, and that gets addictive. And like all addictions it gets destructive.***  \n\n\nI have no idea what you should do, but you should be aware this is indeed a bad sign.",

Assuming she gave no incriminating details/obvious username it may even have been better than confiding in a friend or family member that knows both of you, as far as anonymity. Was it the right thing to do? Probably not, but people in low places don't usually do the perfect thing.\n\nTHAT SAID, I would not give up on your wife if you are making progress on being happier with yourself. She married you for a reason, and she would not have held on for so long if she was not desperate for the man she loves to be back. If sex feels like a chore? That means you're both emotionally distanced. Try to get the emotional intimacy back. Remind her you're still the man she fell in love with and you're still in love with her. \n\nYour wife will say she is done when she is done. She gave the warning, sure, but it's not over just because of what she has thought in the past. It matters how she feels NOW.",

You are taking a lot of time, and effort in trying to improve, and instead, she isn't seeing any of that. That clearly indicates that she already has made up her mind, and is just waiting for a moment to pull the trigger.\n\nAlso the very fact she LIED to you, while you yourself said that during couple therapy, the two of you were told to talk things out, tells me she isn't believing in the therapy SHE is receiving as well. I hate to say it... but your wife is toxic as hell.\n\nAnd sadly, I am speaking from personal experience. When I met my current wife, I was down in the dumps myself, thanks to my, now, ex-wife. She blamed everything on me. And it took a psychiatrist, and everyone around me, that saw the improvements I made, that I wasn't the issue anymore, but she was.\n\nAnd that is now the issue with you.

How\u2019s your oral game? Are you the lover she wants or are you phoning it in?\n\nok, some rough comments. But you can\u2019t fix what you don\u2019t acknowledge.

Start easy like brushing your teeth twice a day, showering every morning, making breakfast for your wife, going for a walk in the fresh air. Each of these things might not make you feel better inside, but if you can act like a regular person it can at least take some of the pressure off in the form of disappointment from others.",

The problem is that am absolutely afraid that she is just waiting to make sure I won't hurt myself and won't be homeless when she goes to give me the boot.   This worry will be always there. \nMy advice to OP is that he should look into some. If the teachings of the twelve step program as there are some good lifetime teachings as well as CBT.  In these situations you need to know that there are only two things in this world anyone can control. One is your actions/reactions and secondly your thoughts.  Don't sweat the small stuff and it's all small stuff.  You can only do you and I would recommend CBT as the principals inside of it will allow you to rewire your brain into something that fulfills what a healthy personality needs by it self, not reliant upon others.  This takes 1-2 years of very hard and dedicated work, but you probably won't come out together with your wife, but you will come out healthy and a great influence on your children and you will find a healthy incredibly loving relationship if that is what you want. Regardless I hope the best for you!",

Not everyone has a difficult time going through their problems when taking these substances in a healing way, the key is to be open to the process. You deserve to be happy. \n\nYou deserve someone who loves you and is there to help you work through your struggles. That person is out there OP, even if it may not be your wife. \n\nEveryone has their struggles, even if some are tougher to overcome than others. Don't count yourself out, every single person at their core is a beautiful and wonderful piece of this giant puzzle that is the Universe, you just have to keep working at it and not let yourself be overcome by what good chances are negative patterns pushed onto you from others throughout your life. Face everything head on and don't be afraid to be true to yourself. \n\nI also highly suggest Tai Chi and daily mindful meditation, it'll do more for you than you could possibly imagine. Even if at first it starts off for only 5 minutes. Just try and give them a solid chance.",

The fact that you knew it would hurt her and also yourself by reading her posts and still did it is a clear symptom of self sabotaging tendencies. \n\nI recommed you follow a simple plan of doing 2 self less acts of kindness a day or week which ever suits your schedule Like feeding a homeless person or animal or something more personal like house chores to take the pressure off your wife, giving her a foot massage, painting the kids room etc. \n\nEven if you you have to force yourself at the begining start it. Depression, among other things, is mental as well as spiritual and I got over mine by being generous and self less which in turn increased my self esteem. You clearly sound like you want things to change. So take such small steps of action. Wish you all the best. Things do get better.",

But I've learned to put up with her, and I'm not inclined to give her half of what I've worked for to make her go away. I'm a little too old for that.

Just don't do it. \n\nThis whole post you talk about working on things and \"trying\". But you offer no details except this one as to what the problem exactly is.  That example is not a problem that requires effort over time. It's a thing you just don't do if that's what she asks. \n\nTo quote my man Yoda, \"Do or do not. There is not try.\"",

She\u2019s already gonna leave you man, instead of whining at her take the power back and say \u201cI\u2019m incapable of being a good husband or father and I know you aren\u2019t happy. I\u2019m not happy either. I\u2019m going to try to sort things out within myself and come back a better man\u201d and then go on a soul journey. It\u2019s crushing to basically see your partner say you are pathetic, but you are. They don\u2019t owe you them being attracted to you or anything because of some idea of love or time. I\u2019m telling you this man. I went through something similar and I held on tight. I did the same thing of trying to be aware of my issues and do like the right thing and work on stuff. I held on and choked everything out that might have been left and now I will never ever even be friends with the mother of my child ever again. Looking back I know if i would have just let her go and worked on myself I may still have a chance today. But I don\u2019t because that\u2019s not what I did.\n\nLet go. Neither of you are going to grow a deeper fondness for each other or anything in that environment. Don\u2019t make her bide her time to kick you out. Be a man and admit you failed your responsibilities even if the reason you failed was because of crippling depression. Don\u2019t try and fight over stuff or try to keep the house or whatever. Leave a good taste in her mouth with how well you handled this and don\u2019t come back until you are happy with yourself. You cannot be the foundation for your family while you are the pathetic mess you are right now. And that\u2019s your job. So if you aren\u2019t gonna be their foundation, why are you there. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to reemphasize this strong enough, but the more you hold on right now the less likely it is that things will ever work out again. No matter what she says when she vents online she still has an amount of love and hope for you or she would\u2019ve bounced out of your life already. Once she loses that last bit of hope it\u2019s probably never going back. Leave before that hope is gone.\n\nEdit: and ignore the people that says to tak to your couple therapy person about it. It doesn\u2019t matter. Your wife feels ashamed about how she feels towards you and she\u2019s absolutely not going to give your therapist the information they need to do their job. Seems like y\u2019all been doing couples therapy and they ain\u2019t saved your relationship. Fuck their advice. This shit is simple. Get your own PERSONAL therapist to work on your depression dude. Couples therapy is trash dude. Your couple therapist homie is gonna want y\u2019all to kill each other\u2019s relationship for a bit longer and  give them money. What I\u2019m telling you to do is the right thing, and they absolutely are not going to advise you guys to stop being their client.",
