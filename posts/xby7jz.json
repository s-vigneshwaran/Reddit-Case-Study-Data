  "text": "TIFU my girlfriend went blind after sex\nMy girlfriend came over to hang out before work today and we had a bit of fun, we might have gotten a bit carried away because when we\u2019d both finished she looked a bit dazed and confused. I asked if everything was okay, and as she was staring into the middle distance she said  \u201cI can\u2019t see anything.\u201d\n\nShe then told me she has a condition that causes her pupils to dilate when she\u2019s crazy stressed or anxious and it causes her to temporarily go blind. (It\u2019s called BEUM according to Google) apparently as we found out today, rough sex can trigger it too. \n\nShe has to drive to work in an hour and currently can only see hazy stars \ud83d\ude2c\n\nAt least I can legitimately say I fucked someone until they couldn\u2019t see straight! \n\nTLDR: girlfriend went temporarily blind after having rough sex and can\u2019t drive to work",

I just think that cumbrellas is a fun term and they do what it says on the tin.\n\nFeel free to go down that rabbithole yourself if you wanna see a bunch of historians argue online about the term \"cumbrella\", its relatively entertaining at least.",

          "text": "I remember the first time my ex-wife passed out after an orgasm. We were still in high school, but I stopped after I realized she was completely out and woke her up.\n\n I was more scared for her than anything, plus I didn\u2019t want to have to walk into the living room and explain the situation to my parents while she had no pants on. When she came to we talked for a few minutes and she didn\u2019t even realize that she\u2019d passed out. So I asked the question what I should do if it were to happen again, because for the 30 seconds or before I realized she wasn\u2019t conscious was essentially rape in my eyes. \n\nShe ended up telling me to just keep going, something still find uncomfortable to think about today. Hearing your girlfriend of a year tell you to keep fucking her after she cums so hard she literally passes out sounds really hot\u2026 in theory. In practice it feels a lot more like you\u2019re raping someone who is unconscious. (Personally even fucking someone that doesn\u2019t make a sound really threw me off and I couldn\u2019t finish.) We talked after the next time about if that was something she got off on or if it was for me. She said both and I asked if it would upset her if I stopped until she was awake. I think I tried a third time and it still didn\u2019t sit well even knowing she got off on it.\n\nSo a few weeks later it\u2019s that time and we decided to move into the floor so we could be a bit rougher without the bed squeaking. She ends up passing out again after an orgasm and my fucking father knocks twice and enters my room unprovoked while I\u2019m trying out her \u201cno need to stop\u201d method. There is no blanket, there is only my ass cheeks and me inside my future ex-wife while she\u2019s clearly unconscious. I mean we had clothes on but they weren\u2019t covering anything. He looks at me for maybe 10 seconds, but what felt like, and was, more time to run through every single scenario of how much I\u2019d be yelled at and couldn\u2019t close my bedroom door anymore, and every argument for me to try. \n\nHe closed the door, and nothing was ever spoken about it. I think a week later he just asked me if we were using condoms and birth control, I told him yes but really ya boi pulls out like futon.",

She definitely did get off on it and I mentioned it in the comment above so that\u2019s why I tried it a third time after but quickly digressed. I understood it was natural enough to not be considered so disruptive to be considered something medical. It\u2019s also something I feel strange even bragging about because it just sounds like a \u201cwho the fuck would believe that?\u201d brag. Only thing believable about it is that I felt insecure about continuing. Also seeing someone you love become completely unconscious before your eyes should set off alarm bells in your head.\n\nYou would think it\u2019s perfectly sane to digress in a situation like this, but upon having the conversation with many friends, of whom I have come to know are good and ethical (especially with women), had differing opinions. I mean guys that I was comfortable leaving alone with her in our apartment later while I was at work. \n\nDo you define perfectly normal and sane by a definition, the average person in question? Their intelligence? Emotional intelligence? Religion? Ethnicity? Orientation? Unless I asked girls or gay dudes about it, the overall consensus among straight dudes was oonga bunga. After. My. Explanation.\n\nThis is all coming from someone who has recently found an interest in sexual sadism, but isn\u2019t comfortable to try it yet because I don\u2019t want to seriously hurt someone.",

Scared me the first time but after I looked it up and found out it can happen I just basically relax in bed till it comes back. It's usually minutes. So weird right. The closest I can describe it, is it's akin to to the feeling when your ear starts to ring and at the same time you cant hear with it but just imagine sound turns down to a muffle or completely off.  Then it just sort of fades back in sort go like when your ear stops ringing and the volume gets turned back on. I'm just missing the ringing part. And it's not an even deafness in both ears... Hence me saying sometimes one goes.. I think one is more muffled than the other. Feels like a minute but could be shorter or longer. My concept of time is off during it. I just wait for it to come back. I hear my own voice talking as far away too during it. I feel like my eyes are slightly involved too a sort of sight whiteness to my vision happens too but mostly the ears. My husband gets so proud when I \"go deaf\".

I wasn\u2019t going to the hospital. It was gonna go away on its own. (I know\u2026lol) So one night about a week into my pneumonia horror show my husband and I were getting frisky. I ended up layed out in the bed with his face between my legs. It was all amazing until I suddenly started seeing stars and everything started going black. I started to pass out from the oxygen deprivation that was exasperated by my\u2026 sexual enthusiasm if you will. Lol. I didn\u2019t get to finish because obviously I couldn\u2019t continue after almost dieing right then and there. Lol. So that sucked but it did make me realize that I should go to the hospital. So I did.  Where they told me it was in fact pneumonia and I was basically stupid as fuck for not coming in sooner. I didn\u2019t have a fever or anything. I just couldn\u2019t fucking breath. But yeah. Lol. That\u2019s my story about blacking out while getting head. \ud83d\ude02",
