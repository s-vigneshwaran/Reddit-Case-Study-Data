This money is now treated as *his* income. \n\nConclusion: The above process would allow a preacher to *directly profit* from donations to his church. The money was the Church's money. Now its the pastor's money. How is this money laundering? Donation lists are not subject to government search. If a criminal organization were to have some illegal cash that they needed to launder, they could donate that money to the church. (With the Pastor's knowledge) The pastor could then \"purchase\" the \"services\" of the front company (A company that appears legitimate, but only exists on paper)  that the criminals operate. The criminals now have a paper trail for their income (as proceeds from business with the pastor) and it can't be traced back, because the church's financials aren't reported.",

They\u2019re told to tithe 10k instead of 6k, because 10k is 10% of their pre-tax income.\n\nSo now they\u2019re at 50k. Take away all essential costs like food, mortgage, bills\u2026and well, that 10k would come in handy. In fact, putting that 10k into stocks would grow their money.

This trait coupled with extraversion create the person who lives to be the center of attention. They develop a certain flair that they wear as easily as any mask and this persona is the image that draws in admirers and climbers who see the mask, but not the person behind it. Once the mask slips or cracks in the persona appear, the social confidence is threatened and the narcissist works harder to keep up the facade. Fortunately, the slippage of the mask can tip off others and the negative vibes can be strong enough to scatter the flock of sycophants or cast doubt among the narcissist\u2019s followers.\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/lifetime-connections/201806/narcissist-or-charismatic-leader-how-spot-the-difference\n\n***Celebrity preacher faces backlash after photos purporting to show luxury lifestyle appear online***  https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/joel-osteen-preacher-luxury-lifestyle-b1888237.html",

If you want to enter life, keep the commandments.\u201d  \n18 \u201cWhich ones?\u201d he inquired.  \nJesus replied, \u201c\u2018You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, 19 honor your father and mother,\u2019\\[c\\] and \u2018love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019\\[d\\]\u201d  \n20 \u201cAll these I have kept,\u201d the young man said. \u201cWhat do I still lack?\u201d  \n21 Jesus answered, *\u201cIf you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.\u201d*  \n22 When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth.  \n23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, *\u201cTruly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d*\n\nMatthew 19:16-23",

It was the \"burglary and theft\" team no less. If the church was paid an insurance claim on the original theft, which I don't know if they where, then that money actually belongs to the insurance company.",
