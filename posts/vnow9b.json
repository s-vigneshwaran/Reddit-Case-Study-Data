The violently competing ideologies of the US inform those of a great many other countries world wide, through a combination of extremely saturated media (both fiction, and non-fiction like documentaries and news shows) and the \"soft power\" of diplomatic and cultural exchange programmes etc.\n\n(for example, immediately following your recent court action allowing abortion bans, the conservatives in my country started agitating for same, praising those in the US who made it happen \ud83e\udd2e. We have also seen quite a few protestors with Trump and QAnon signs... sigh)\n\nOur fates are closely intertwined (for better, or for worse...) and if you fail, we are likely to fail also... probably wiped out by the resulting hyper-belligerent fascist police state with control over the largest military force in the world several times over \ud83d\ude11)",

No campaign funding could come from any other source. Not political parties, not businesses, not unions, not private individuals. No one could donate to a candidate or office holder, period, all campaign funds come out of the common bucket of money.\n\nAlso, no stock trading is allowed, no gifts, no free trips, none of that nonsense. All travel, food, and other expenses are paid for by their annual budget or paycheck.\n\nFinally, no candidate or office holder can be a member of any political party. Parties could endorse candidates, but they can't have candidates on their list of members, and can't donate directly, it goes into the bucket.",

Society understands that at a certain point people should lose their drivers license because they are a danger to everyone around them.

That the only right position is to hate both of them.\n\nConservatives don't have that problem.\n\nSo while more liberal views divide up into bite size little groups that are easy to eliminate and pit against each other, the right votes in lockstep. And because of that they gained absolute control in 2016 and we have lost Roe versus wade. A change which is literally going to be killing women.  If my wife was living in one of the states affected by this if you years ago, she would be dead from an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nHad the Democrats and been elected, that wouldn't have happened.\n\nWe can split hairs about this group is good about this, that group is good about that, but after decades of that it really just feels self-serving.\n\nThe klan marches with the right. Roe versus Wade falls with the right.  \n\nThe church marches with the right.  \n\nAn elected representative in my state who feels men who oppose biblical rule should be murdered and women kept around his breeding cattle marches with the right.\n\nExtremist factions who have been stockpiling weapons and attacking peaceful protesters regarding the ruling march with the right.\n\nThe people who attempted a coup d'etat on January 6th march with the right.\n\n\n\nI won't feign neutrality.  I'm a Democrat and vote straight ticket Democrat in every election.  And I will continue to do so until the right is a viable political party as opposed to a death cult.\n\n>I will say this: I am 100% Atheist and I vote every election, and have since Ronald Reagan ran for reelection.\n\nYou got a few years on me, I have voted in every election since 2000. \n\nIn that election, the left was divided up with Nader. I was living in Florida at the time, and I was convinced that Al Gore was boring and that we needed real change.\n\nSo instead of electing a man who was so obsessed with climate change back when there was a chance for us to actually do something about it, we elected Bush just in time for him to stick our dick in the Middle East for a generation.\n\nBecause of me and a fraction of percent of people like me.\n\nBecause division is how you beat the left.\n\nI'm now a Democrat.",

It's just anger directed it officials and trying to castrate them without clear goals.\n\nLook at some of the realities of what we're talking about, separate it from your anger.\n\nWorking in the government is a complex job, just as being a doctor, lawyer, any complicated involved job is. It requires an intricate team and knowledge of the system to do well.\n\nThis is not royalty. They're not just giving a thumbs up or thumbs down based on their opinions, and viewing the position like that is not understanding it.\n\nWith this in mind, what good is a revolving door of new people who don't know what they're doing?\n\nThis is exactly why the Heritage foundation wants this to happen. It gives them more control. It makes it easier for them to rapidly hand over the reins of government to corporate interests. Even faster than is already happening.\n\nThey're using your anger and outrage at the system as a tool to manipulate you.\n\nPlease understand that.  You're right to be upset, but you need to address specific problems with specific solutions.\n\nI'm personally of the opinion that the issue is not term limits, we shouldn't be punishing good Representatives by firing them.  We need to ensure that there are good options for Representatives that are constantly challenged.  \n\nIf you have a good representative, they should serve for 10, 20 years. As long as they are consistently earning the respect of the people electing them.  I wouldn't fire a doctor every 8 years, I wouldn't fire a lawyer every 8 years. I would want them to keep up on what they're doing, and continually prove that they can do good work, but arbitrarily firing them after a few years is ludicrous if you want an effective system.\n\n> Want to know if this is really a good idea? Does McConnell Pelosi etc carrer leeches want this...no...than it's probably a good idea. \n\n\n\n> Also I would add personal spending caps while in office so they cannot live at a higher standard of living than minimum wage. \n\nThis is another perfect example of it just being aimless anger and not being anything actually tied to reality. I get it, you're angry, and you have a good reason to be. This stupidity is just anger though.\n\nImagine you actually got this nonsense pushed through, *think about the consequences.*\n\nThe only people who would want to have these jobs would be people abusing the system.  Are you going to spend decades getting into a position to be elected so that you can live at the edge of poverty for something you may or may not have any control over?\n\nYou're just going to end up with more corporate funded politicians than you already have.\n\nQuit letting your anger be used as a tool to manipulate you.  Channel that anger into action that addresses the problems, not mindlessly lashes out at them because you want to hurt politicians.\n\nThis is a problem that you solve through improving the voting system and representation.\n\nAnd quite frankly, most of the problems with our government isn't a reflection on the government itself.  What you're seeing right now in our politics is a reflection of an ideological battle that is being fought in our country.\n\nOne that we are losing. Handedly.\n\nBecause while we are angrily lashing out trying to hurt the figureheads that we have decided are the cause of all of our problems, we are getting our asses kicked by the actual sources of those problems.\n\nPlease.  I know that the internet has taught you all of the memes about being angry at politicians, and I know that you want to channel that outrage, but this is not aimed at the right target. The people on the other side of this ideological battle are using your anger as a tool against you.\n\nAnd they are very good at that.\n\nLook at the last elections. Look at the division that has given them control of the supreme court. Look at all of the advances they have made in the last decade. All of it is on the backs of this division, all of it is on the backs of convincing us to attack the wrong targets.  \n\nHolding this view is literally being a foot soldier for the heritage foundation.  They're paying to spread this idea, and it has affected the areas that you get your opinions from.\n\nPlease step back and think.",
