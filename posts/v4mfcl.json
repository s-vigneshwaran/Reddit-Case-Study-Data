Because we were asked if we were cool with the people who wanted to watch could.we loved the idea because as responsible adults who are well adjusted sexuality we found it to be exciting. Sorry that you have never had sex with someone who is not family \ud83e\udd23 but maybe you will be asked by your Dad to jerk off for him. U might feel the same way we did.
