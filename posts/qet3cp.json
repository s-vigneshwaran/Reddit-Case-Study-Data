  "text": "TIFU by kissing my deaf Friend\nHi there. (22M)\n\nI'll try to keep it short.\n\nI met a girl through a mutual friend. We've known eachother for roughly a year, but haven't spend time alone yet, always in a group. She's very sweet and pretty.\n\nShe's not completly deaf , she can still hear a bit, with the help of hearing aids.\n\nI guess  mild deafness, not sure tho?.\n\nYesterday we met up with our mutual friends, we were having a barbecue. Later on, we ran out of snacks, so the other two went to the grocery store\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe were alone in the yard, chatting etc.\n\nNow I noticed that she kept staring at my lips, so I thought to myself does she want to kiss me?.\n\nSince she didn't stop staring I thought, that it's obvious. This time I'm not going to miss a hint.\n\nI leaned in to give her a kiss, I mean she did kinda kiss me back, but afterwards it was like dead silence.  Thank God the other two arrived a few minutes later.\n\nThe rest of the evening was super akward between us. Later as she left, I told the other two friends that I had kissed her because she kept staring at my lips.\n\nThey started laughing saying Of course she's staring at your lips , she's lipreading.!\n\nMan, I totally forgot that deaf people also use lipreading to communicate, and since she's never actually done that before I didn't take that into consideration\n\nThis will definitly be one of the moments that'll make me stay up at night and cringe, plus I probably ruined the friendship.\n\nTL;DR by thinking my friend wanted to kiss me, she probably didn't.\n\n\nUPDATE:  Okay, Guys I sent her a message, asking if she wants to come over.\n\nShe said she'll be here in an hour.\n\nI'm nervous lol, I'm trying to convince my roomate to go on a long walk.\n\n\nUpdate 2:\n\nSorry that you guys had to wait that long. \nShe just left 5 minutes ago.\n\nI didn't tell her beforehand, that I wanted to talk to her about the kiss, so it was a bit akward approaching the topic.\n I can't go into full detail now, but I told her that I didn't mean to make her feel uncomftable and that I had misread the signs. \nWe had a good laugh. \nAfterwards I asked her If she'd be down to maybe try things out if she's interested.\n\nThe thing is, she's going to move to Munich, Germany in a few months (end of march) (I live in France) and she told me that, while she does like me, she didn't plan on making any romantic interest, because she doesn't want to get too attached, due to her moving away anyways. \n\n She admitted to liking me alot and would like to give it a shot despite the circumstances ,  but only under the condition that I am being serious about it, since she doesn't want something that's only casual.\n\nWe're going on a date on Tuesday, and we'll just see if it works out between us.",

Once you get the basics down, everything but the specialised signs come pretty easy. My main piece of advice, and really it goes for most all translation of different languages but even moreso with sign, just remember that you aren't signing from a word to a sign. You're going from the concept to the sign.\n\nMy prof put it like this when asked how to sign \"run\":\n\nWhich kind of run? Person was running? Nose was running? Faucet was running? Don't try to think of the work, but the concept of running and put that into a sign.\n\nIt was a little difficult to grasp immediately, but after that click, things went a lot easier.\n\nAnyway, that's my two cents. Spend them wisely. And I agree with the others, if you explain what happened and your misunderstanding, I'm sure she'll understand. And that she kissed back, even just initially, might be a good sign she may have wanted to continue, but felt a little nervous or caught off guard. But that she didn't freak out is, well, maybe not a good sign, but definitely not a bad sign. Good like to you, bro. Hope things work out well.",

He answered that he was learning it so he could communicate better with a girl he had a crush on.

One gun shoots into the back of the thumb of the other gun. It's hard to describe in text.\n\nEdit to add - googling won't get you far. Like most rude things, there's plenty of different words / signs for it, and any dictionary search will only turn up a few of the variations.",

She kisses me back but the look on her face was not a good one. To this day we both view that kiss different. I say she was horrified, she says it was nice.

I have a feeling she\u2019s lipread around you for a while and you just haven\u2019t noticed.\n\nI recommend apologizing to her directly as soon as you can and as clearly as you can. Write her an apology on a card or something so that she has a recap. You don\u2019t have to read off the card like it\u2019s a speech, but it should help avoid confusion. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t swerve around the fact that you find her attractive and that motivated the decision. You don\u2019t have to make some kind of massive confession of undying love, but it will help your case to be honest with her about everything. \n\nAlso, in the future, it probably wouldn\u2019t be rude to ask if there\u2019s anything you could do to communicate more clearly. You shouldn\u2019t ask \u201cHow Deaf are you?\u201d So much as, \u201cHey, do I do anything that makes me hard to hear or understand?\u201d Especially do this if you two become physically or romantically involved. There is nothing more frustrating than being unable to hear your significant other and asking them to repeat themselves constantly.\n\nEdit:\n\nAlso, a tip from me to you: if you\u2019re walking together someplace while trying to have a conversation, make sure you are matching her walking pace and LOOKING AT HER every time you speak. Otherwise you are projecting your voice off somewhere in the distance AND she can\u2019t read your lips. \n\nMy boyfriend still gets mad at me because I have to make him repeat himself constantly when we shop.\n\nEdit 2: \n\nGood god folks. He doesn't abuse me. He gets a little irritated that we have to stop in the middle of shopping so that we can communicate properly. *I* get irritated at it, often to the point of gently, physically moving him so that I can see his face properly. We're both frustrated in these situations at the CIRCUMSTANCES not at EACH OTHER. Target is a hellscape for my auditory processing, and it's where this shit always happens. Also, the man has Tourette's and isn't always in control of where he is looking... so jot that down.\n\nNot everyone can constantly be mindful of someone else's needs while in the middle of performing a task. Sometimes he actually needs to look away while he is speaking. This is normal. It's just important to *try* to be mindful. \n\nHe supports me in my disability. He picks up my meds when I'm too ill to do it, buys me food when I can't afford to feed myself, helps me study and stay productive while I'm in school, helps me stay on track of my to-do list so my life doesn't spiral out of control, and has NEVER complained about the fact that I have permanent control of all volume knobs in the house and car. He's also just... a nice person who cares about other people. \n\nI'm honestly *really mad* that someone took my mini pet peeve rant and turned it into abuse. My goal was to give a tip to the OP so that he can do his best and be considerate. My boyfriend's best is enough for me.",

I understand that domestic violence survivors don't see things clearly, but you had no reason to think I was *actually* in a domestic violence situation. What I was *trying* to do was have a casual bitch about something that only comes up every so often.

Shopping is the *one* time where he consistently has trouble because we are always rushing and multitasking. This comment is so fucking annoying and upsetting, to a degree that you ***do not*** understand.\n\nMy boyfriend is the kind of person to go out and buy a tablecloth and cloth napkins for an at-home Valentine's dinner because he wants me to have \"the restaurant experience\" without the noise and nervousness that I've had every other year. He gets me out of loud and overwhelming situations. He cries with me when I'm discriminated against for my ADHD and going through pain. And that's just the big stuff. He does so much more in the little, every day gestures that I couldn't list it here without being completely obnoxious. I have been told multiple times, by multiple people, that he could do way better and I should cut him loose. **That** is why this is so hurtful. I'm about done with people who don't know me weighing in on the first relationship that has made me happy.\n\n**Take a whole entire hike.** If you actually wanted to be helpful (instead of theorizing about a stranger for morbid entertainment), you could have DM'ed me to ask questions and confirm my safety. You didn't. You didn't even reply to *my* comment. \n\nI'm kind of sorry for the RSD that this comment might cause, but you *need to understand* that this was not cool on any level.

If it doesn't satisfy you, feel free to follow updates to find out if those will even happen anymore. \n\nShe wants a *serious relationship* and she *doesn't want to get hurt*. The term that I think she and/or OP used wrong was attachment. Serious and attachment are connected and so wanting one but not the other isn't possible. Thus I think she meant *getting hurt*. \n\nIf that relationship becomes serious for her she will get hurt if breakup happens and it's very likely to happen as she's moving away.\n\nIf it were casual for both of them, it wouldn't hurt much to leave that relationship behind. That wouldn't be a strange thing young couple to do but if one gets attached then that relationship becomes serious and one probably gets hurt.\n\nThere's also this context that the girl is coming back and not staying away. So she probably wishes to either have relationship that lasts separation (a serious) or she doesn't want have any.",

      "text": "> I guess mild deafness\n\nThe term you're looking for is Hard of Hearing. I studied to become an interpreter for the deaf and staring at lips is very common. Im Not dead and I still do it because it helps with additional comprehension of what they're saying. I've been doing it for a while though because I have hearing issues that may likely turn into deafness or being hard of hearing later in life, so might as well get it down now. I actually really love American sign language and sign language in general. It's a more logical language system in my mind.\n\nEvery spoke language is just a set of arbitrary noises that we've come to associate those specific sounds with specific meanings. Whereas a lot of sign language is representation. For instance, you sign \"cup\" and you literally make a cup shape with your hand (one hand open, flat, with palm up, other hand in a \"C-shape\" on the palm of the hand and raised to show a cup shape). To say \"drink\" you seriously make the \"cup\" sign and raise it to your lips like you're drinking. And a lot of signs are like that. So you're just using. Your hands to represent objects and then move them like they would in the story you're telling. So even someone who doesn't know sign would be able to pick up on maybe 40% without any previous exposure to sign language, just by using a little critical thinking.\n\nI just love sign language. And fun fact: American Sign Language was based on French sign language, because France was one of the first places to have an official sign language. You can see the remnants of the french influence in ASL to this day. For instance, in ASL, to sign \"hi/hello\", you do a simple hi gesture or a salute, but it's still typically signed with the initialisation of \"B\" (meaning your hand makes the \"B\" shape while saluting) because it's the initial for \"bonjour\". There are other parts the bled in and are still there, but that's the easiest example.\n\nI very much suggest and support everyone learning sign language. It's a beautiful language and any and all of the deaf community would be ecstatic with you learning it. Often if someone doesn't speak someone else's language well, the native speaker can sometimes (not uncommon) get irritated that you don't speak it perfectly, and usually they themselves don't speak if correctly anyway. But pretty much and deaf person would be beyond happy to find out you were studying their language. Even if you only know a little, they take it as you taking the time out of your day in order to be able to communicate with them, and they take it as a huge compliment. Which, really, it what we all should do. Anyone taking the time from their day to learn your language should be respected for the effort they're putting in.\n\nAnyway, rant over. Be nice to deaf people.",

Make sure you have a pen and a pad of paper, or that you have a transcription program set up on your phone (sometimes just using notes works) so she can read what you are saying.  Get all of this set up ahead of time, practice with it with someone to make sure it works.  Don't put all the burden of communicating on her.  u/throwawayd456uf make sure you never ever say \"Never mind\" when the communication gets a bit difficult or \"I'll tell you later.\"  They are perfect responses for destroying your relationship before it has a chance to start.  Make sure she's looking at you before you start to talk.  I personally hate being grabbed or touched to get my attention and I prefer that the person do the deaf wave.  Hearing people can mess up using lights to flash or stomping to get attention so make sure you do things the way she wants them done.",

It's just that being hearing-impaired means she can't readily jump into conversations or hear others with the normal confidence that others have. Conversations\u2014particularly in a group setting or in a loud environment, even if one-on-one\u2014can be difficult to follow. She's trying to process what is being said and the conversation is moving too quickly. I would not be surprised if she's actually quite assertive and confident when she can hear you properly. That's my experience, at least, as hearing-impaired.",

Real life is not a romance novel as you said, but its also not a courtroom where you have to actively prove consent was given. For example I never verbally confirmed consent to having my dick sucked. Needless to say, I very much consented.\n\nTalking about consent is pretty complicated, so no need to be astounded by basics. It is clear that you can consent to sexual activity and change your mind later on. If the person is actively continuing without consent, its clearly rape. If you ask for consent to fuck, how do you know the consent was not retracted? Do you periodically ask if it is still okay to fuck? I wish you did, that would be funny. Of course then you could say that once consent is given it is safe to assume consent is maintained unless said otherwise. But then we have cases where victims of rape that were not consenting were too afraid/shocked to even speak.\n\nIts also worth noting that you (and OP) are unsure of whether the girl wanted to be kissed or not. Could it have been avoided by asking? Yes. However verbal confirmation of consent is not generally maintained.",

Explain to her what happened, tell her you obviously wanted to do it anyways so it's a happy accident. Who knows, this could be a funnycatory years down the road when you're together. Dont punish yourself for going for something. You're not taking advantage of someone and shes a grown woman. \n\nAsk yourself this, did you like the kiss, do you think she liked it, and is it something you'd like to do again? I'm not saying go all out and try and marry her,  but if you do like her, let her know. The only thing worse than thinking you may have messed up a friendship, is not doing anything and knowing you missed a relationship.\n\nBe honest with her but be honest with yourself too. You didnt kiss her because you disliked her. You saw an opportunity to kiss her, though you misread the situation, but you went in for a kiss nonetheless. We have this one life and we aren't getting any younger, give it your all! Please update us all afterwards! \n\nSending prayers and good vibes that all goes well!",

I don't know if this girl spends a lot of time with other deafies or not, so she might not be familiar with deaf culture. But if she is, it might not mean anything.\n\nBTW, if some isn't totally deaf, most people use the term Hard of Hearing.",

LONG time ago, and I was nuts about her.  Luckily she realized I was an idiot and flat out told me to kiss her.  I did... She was babysitting her nephew, and this kid did NOT like us sucking face so he just stood RIGHT in front of us glaring at me. So then she noticed my eyes were open, saw him, and basically said he's fine, just ignore him.  So I'm making out with a girl I'd been nuts about for ages, and this damn kid is just staring at me from at most 3' away.  I hope that kid had the same thing happen to him a few years down the road, because it was really killing the mood.\n\nAnyway... Make sure you give us an update! Cheers!",

They would rather you ask for clarification than to move on through the conversation leaving them with the assumption that you fully understand them.  \nYou do not have to yell or raise your voice (unless they ask) to communicate you just have to be succinct and clear.  \nIf you don't understand, ask.  And ask again.  And again until you DO understand.  \nAgain, we are generally are conditioned to not make ourselves look dumb or silly so we only will ask \"what?\" maybe twice at most.  Then we will just act like we get it (because we get most of it) and move on in the conversation.  \nAlways ask for clarification.  It will be appreciated more than you know.  \nGranted this is a generalization of a vastly varied group of people and personalities but it holds true overall.  \nPro-Tip from an interpreter for the Deaf and HOH....  \nIf you don't feel silly when you first start communicating with someone Deaf or HOH, then you probably aren't expressing yourself fully or conveying your conversation in the way you desire.",
