Where can he go from here? It's in his soul, emptiness, his relationships are fake, he can't be his authentic self, he's trapped in the rat race with no power to escape. He's trapped, alone and afraid, probably wishing he could feel some real humanity for once in his life, wishing he could drop the act that has consumed his existence and let go but he can't.

But it's your money and you can obviously do anything to want with it, I also have silly hobbies\")",

You follow this up with what makes Fight Club the best movie and how it\u2019s almost as good as the book, which happens to be the only book you\u2019ve read in the last 15 years. Inside you\u2019re lonely and empty, but unfortunately you think being relatively attractive is enough.\n\nYou will be that weird guy at the bar who\u2019s like 45 but has the same haircut and the same style trying to pick up chicks half his age with some corny ass pickup line. The nights you are unable to bring anyone home (which will increase as time goes on) will force you to look at your pathetic existence and the loneliness that is staring back at you in the reflection of another scotch on the rocks, sat alone in your \u201cbachelor pad\u201d.\n\nCool shirt though, I had it in red when I was 9.",
