The individualistic streak we have is not going anywhere, certainly not within a generation or five.\n\nI guess I don't see a \"winner take all\" solution as viable. These people exist, they aren't going anywhere, they aren't changing. So, much like a family member with behavioral issues (and they may literally be the same individuals), I suggest the better option is to give them a way to channel that individualism into something productive that minimizes harm to the world. It's totally compatible with the common good, it just needs the right direction and clear boundaries.\n\nEdit: About half the people I know are like this. They're also some of the most innovative, ingenious, hard-working and cunning people I know. As long as they're working and seeing their efforts pay off, usually they're pretty happy. They tend not to be able to tolerate, though, people who *appear* to be lazy or \"leeching from the system.\" That needs a remedy, too, either in practice or perception.\n\nSome people just *can't work,* and those people exist and aren't going anywhere, either. Hard chargin' go-getters may have a harder time relating to that, so it's an education/messaging issue, IMO.",

The way I see it is this country will continue the way it is now because its hard to stop a run away train, people in general will reach a breaking point, there will be some sort of collapse, and that will be the deciding point. Once the collapse happens then either we will correct ourselves and head to a better direction or the most delusional, selfish, and hateful people will win and lead the country to fascism. If that happens then abandon ship.\n\nI really think the country will head to fascism because even the people who claim to want for the better good actually don't want that. They want for what they perceive as good. We are tribalistic by nature. We care about our tribe and will gladly fight against the \"enemy\". So long as the media, government, corporations, and social media seek to divide us for their own profits we will never be one tribe or a group of different people with a common identity. Without that common identity to unify us we will head to fascism.",

A strange understanding, and really scary to actually understand\n\n>But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That\u2019s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked\u2014if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \u201943 had come immediately after the \u2018German Firm\u2019 stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \u201933. But of course this isn\u2019t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  \n>  \n>And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying \u2018Jewish swine,\u2019 collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in\u2014your nation, your people\u2014is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\n\n*-They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45*\n\nI think of that often.  I remember getting into arguments with delusional right wingers going into the 2020 election. I used to write about parallels in Trump's rhetoric to Hitler's rhetoric.\n\nOne of the points a delusional person used to rebuttal me was, \"Trump could never be like Hitler. We have no Reichstag event.\"\n\nTo which I said to him, \"it's not that we haven't had it yet, it's that we should never even be having this discussion that it could happen.\"\n\nFast forward to January 6th, 2021.  I actually went back to try and find those comments to say, \"told you so.\"\n\n>if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in \u201943 had come immediately after the \u2018German Firm\u2019 stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in \u201933.\n\n\"German firm\" vs \"America first.\" \u201cNational community\" vs \"the silent majority.\" \"Libtard,\" \"evil Democrats/socialists\" and more are also very similar to how the Nazis demonized their enemies.  Not limited to just those examples.\n\nIf anyone spends a few moments doing an [exercise like this, ](https://www.facinghistory.org/holocaust-and-human-behavior/chapter-6/visual-essay-impact-propaganda) then it's scary to start seeing the parallels to the right wing party and conspiracy theorists.",

It's the only way to stop power from being too concentrated in the hands of a tiny few.

We're Americans first, and don't let your party, a media outlet, or even another American to tell you otherwise. Every time we solely blame the other party for all of the nation's ills, we're playing right into their plan.\n\nWe need to listen to the other side's concerns, fears and worries, and take them seriously, without just waiting to argue. We're all being lied to. Your \"opponents\" are just victim to a different set of lies than you are. Calm down, drink a beer, wine, coffee or tea with the other side, and fucking listen. They usually don't arrive at their conclusions for zero reason. Something caused it, and that something isn't a broken system...the system is working exactly as intended. \n\nInstead of listening to the other side and working together for *common* good, we see the other as an extreme and assume they're just wrong. Media is doing this to us. We're in information bubbles that are hard to burst, even with good intent.\n\nBest solution: Cut them out of the equation.

However, Christianity was neither well-organized nor very popular until some 300 years after the fact and so the documentation is a bit thin.  There are letters of varying levels of valid attribution from Clement of Rome (as well as Ignatius and Eusebius who were contemporaneous) placing Peter in Rome and having been martyred c. 64 CE but as far as the whole \"establishing the church and being in charge of it\" thing, it's not so clear-cut.",

Except that many denominations have their own take on things. And the King James Bible has King James in the title for reasons that many Christians are uncomfortable about, not to mention the Jewish people have their own holy book, as do those who follow Islam, all of which are recounting the events involving the same dude. Then there\u2019s the problem with translations. Some things can\u2019t be translated 1:1, so it\u2019s up to the interpreter to try to put into words in another language what is trying to be said versus an exact, word for word translation. And those who translated were just people. People who have beliefs and opinions as varied as people today, who objectively have far more education and information to draw upon. But sure - with all that, every single believer truly believes that *their* version and interpretation is absolute fact - which can vary between clergy from church to church within the same religion. And a good number of them want to shove their version down your throat and punish the fuck out of you if you don\u2019t comply. Oh, and let\u2019s not leave out Mormons. They have a modern prophet who had his own version which had some differences which even as new as that religion is, has had to backpedal certain things like polygamy. Then there are different sects of Islam. Each having their own versions of things. \n\nIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s all made up, but the one common thread is \u201cdo what I tell you to do, or else.\u201d Divine right, manifest destiny, bringing god to the savages via the sword and gun, etc. it\u2019s all bullshit, and I\u2019m so, so sick of the bullsh\u012bt. All of these people need to keep their magical thinking to themselves because frankly, in any other context you\u2019d be able to get DPOA over them, have them involuntary committed, put on meds, forced into therapy and given a case worker. But because they say Jesus instead of Elvis or Henry down the street it\u2019s all good and treated with respect and reverence that you don\u2019t dare fucking question because it\u2019s a person\u2019s freedom of religion.",

Stress on \"no matter what\" , that's freedom to sin all the way to pedophilia and murder with absolutely no consequences after death. \n\nOnce saved, always saved. \n\nCatholics on the other hand, I was taught, believed, a) there's no such thing as a non-cancellable ticket to heaven via \"asking Jesus into your heart\", if you were a truly good person and did good things Jesus would let you in (after a pitstop in purgatory to straighten any sins here and there), especially if you confess to priests and stuff like that. \n\nThere were many other things we hated about Catholics but at its very base is we believed they are all going to hell because they aren't doing it right. \n\nBesides, wouldn't rather believe you can do anything you want and still get into heaven? Not just the \"goody two shoes\" people? \n\nA get out of hell free card that cannot be revoked or canceled for any reason? \n\nI was 12 when I saw the ridiculous of it all, I hate that I'm the only one I know who has, everyone else is still caught up in it, but that's the way it is, whaddayagonnado?",

You absolutely have to have faith, but God doesn't care for the \"you can do what you want because you're forgiven\" loophole.  That's actually backed up Biblically too.  It's in Romans, chapter 8, I think.\n\nBasically, you get a clean slate, but you have to try to keep it clean.  We're gonna slip up, sure, but you still have to be repentant when you do.  That's one of those things that I still kinda understand and allow to influence my own morality.  'No one's perfect, we're all gonna screw up from time to time.  Go easy on yourself, but keep trying to be better.\"  That's my philosophy.  Or one of them, anyway.",

You can basically say that Jews are split into 2 large groups religious (Orthodox) and less religious (non-Orthodox).  Increasingly, at a rapid pace over the past 2 decades, Orthodox Jews have voted Republican.  Right now, it's something like 90% of non-Orthodox Jews vote Democrat and 80% of Orthodox Jews vote Republican.  In Florida, the Orthodox population is large, growing, and loves DeSantis.  DeSantis is enormously popular with this group because he stands for all kinds of unconstitutional things that blur the line between church and state, amongst other things.  Although technically, Orthodox Jews should be in agreement with this lawsuit, it's not an issue of any importance to them.  Things like \"family values\" and school funding are way more important.  DeSantis has nothing to worry about from the Orthodox population.  Non-Orthodox Jews, who initiated this lawsuit, are a group that DeSantis has already left out of his political calculation.  He has known from the start they will always hate him and never vote for him, so no change there.",

It\u2019s it\u2019s own independent government at the very least equivalent to the city level if not the county. \n\nThey love keeping everything secret in their planning stages, they don\u2019t want to lose that. What if every new ride had plans filed with the county? What if county police acted they way they do at a Disney park? (I had a senile grandpa go a little wild on me on Disney land. He would have been arrested by any other cop, but Disney cops show WAY more discretion). They do tax the hotels on their land, and purchases made there on top of the business lease. That\u2019s long term revenue they would lose. Even garbage collection, something they go to great lengths to hide won\u2019t be in their control anymore. \n\nI think it\u2019s much more a case of perceived value than tangible value.",

The reason is that we have notions of ethical responsibility that can demand things of you that might infringe on your rights (even when these rights are not in contention).\n\nFor example, I think most people would say you are not morally compelled to buy things for or give your possessions to others, even if they truly need it and you truly don\u2019t. It might be ethically supererogatory, but certainly not mandatory - you have a right to do whatever you like with your property. \n\nBut it\u2019s possible to have responsibilities that override this right; the obvious case is with children (fully born ones). Neglecting your child is considered an ethical violation - you are morally compelled to provide for their needs. The reason is that you are responsible for your children; you have entered a moral contract that you will provide them with certain things (food, shelter, safety, affection) if possible. Parents enter into this contract implicitly, but we can see this play out explicitly with people who are dependent due to disability - their caretakers are liable for criminal neglect, since they have assumed responsibility.\n\nThis sets up a critical counter argument to the bodily autonomy argument. Assuming that fetuses ARE people deserving of moral consideration, and that the conception was fully consensual, then even passive abortion (e.g. by the mother starving herself) would constitute an ultimate act of ethical neglect. The fetus exists solely because of the parents, and is totally dependent on them; by all rights, they have assumed responsibility for it. In the same way guardians are morally compelled to care for children (even at the expense to their right to property), we can say mothers are morally compelled to carry the fetus (even at the expense of her right to bodily autonomy).\n\nFor the record, I am totally pro choice because A) I don\u2019t think fetuses are fully people and B) even if abortion is immoral, illegalizing it ultimately has measurably worse outcomes. But if one concedes that fetuses are people, these kind of bodily autonomy arguments vulnerable to a lot of attacks and I think are ultimately unconvincing.",

In developed countries, the state is an ever-willing guardian, so it's easy to miss this distinction. But consider the case of abandoning a child in a country with no governmental or community (e.g. family/friends) safety net. We would rightfully harshly judge any parent who abandons their child to totally fend for themselves - they have breached the moral duty they took on by becoming the child's guardian.\n\n> And parenthood and bodily autonomy are separate issues.\n\nI'm just trying to demonstrate that our moral duties can sometimes supercede our rights. Parenthood/guardianship is just an example of a moral duty that I think is relevant is in this case, but you could come up with others.\n\n> I'd also like to point out that our current laws about not being able to force anyone to give up organs, or even just blood-- a relatively painless, easy process-- don't have exceptions for one's own children. We can make arguments about the ethics of not giving a pint of blood to save your own child, but the government isn't going around mandating that anyone do so.\n\nI was making a moral argument, not a legal one. Our government doesn't nor should enforce moral actions; in the US, we operate on the principle that liberty (and thus limited government) is a good thing in-and-of itself. One can hold the positions in my argument (which, again, I don't), but still believe the government has no place controlling my body. \n\nThe vaccine mandates being overturned as illegal is an excellent example of what I'm pointing at. I believe that not vaccinating is an immoral action; assuming the vaccine is indeed safe and effective, you are endangering the lives of others around you for no reason at all. Nonetheless, enforcing a vaccine mandate is still wrong, because the government should not have that kind of power - forcing everyone to vaccinate would cost too much liberty, even if it was purely for a good cause. Liberty entails being allowed to make immoral choices in certain cases.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think giving blood to your child is strongly analogous, and indeed I believe it would be similarly immoral to refuse to donate blood to your own child if they needed it (assuming you have not relinquished responsibility over them to another guardian).\n\n> Consent also must be ongoing for any other bodily autonomy. You can sign up to be an organ donor, then revoke it, or show up to a blood draw and change your mind halfway through. There is no such thing as signing up and then being tied down and forced into conceding your bodily autonomy for blood or organ donation. I don't understand why a fetus you never consented to allow into your body would somehow supercede this.\n\nThe argument I presented is that bodily autonomy can be superceded in certain cases by a moral obligation to someone else (with the case of a guardian and dependent being the example used). Once the moral duty is taken on, consent is no longer a factor. \n\nIndeed, I also believe that it is immoral to agree to a life-saving medical procedure for someone then back out with no extenuating circumstance (e.g. finding another donor). I would never want the government to enforce that, but I will harshly judge someone who sentences another to death like that after having accepted the duty to save them.\n\n> I don't understand why a fetus you never consented to allow into your body would somehow supercede this.\n\nIt is much harder to argue against abortion in the case of non-consensual conceptions, like rape or failed birth control. I make attempt at such an argument.",

I assume by resource constraints you mean a critical lack of money (and the kind of necessities you buy with money, like food or shelter), since mere resource constraint is true for everyone as long as scarcity exists.\n\nAre you saying that abortion is morally permissible in cases where due to resource constraints, it is physically impossible to provide for the basic needs of the child (e.g. the child will certainly be malnourished, or homeless, etc.)? I can probably buy this in principle; it seems unreasonable that you should be morally obligated, guardian or otherwise, to undertake the beginning of a task that is totally doomed to fail (providing for this child), so simply aborting the task entirely may be justified.\n\nNonetheless, this seems like a moot point in the US (or other developed countries) context. Since the state is willing to take on the obligation of actually raising the child, the mother need only carry the fetus to term. For those that need the assistance, even our meager social safety net provides the bare necessities to keep mothers alive in the US - which is normally sufficient to keep the fetus alive as well until it can be delivered.\n\nAlternatively, you might be proposing that abortion can be permissible in cases where providing for the child is plausible, but this would place a substantial strain on resources for the parents (they would have to make significant sacrifices). In this case, I don't see why even in principle this removes the parents' moral obligation. I don't see why adversity should excuse people from the moral obligations that they take on.",

At what time is a young adult an adult?\n\nAll of these are transitionary.  \n\nWe set legal times for the sake of simplicity, but they're not based on anything real. Hell look at our definition of adult and when we define the drinking age... Drinking at the age of 21 still does a significant amount of harm, the brain isn't done developing until mid 20s.  But it is an arbitrary time that we have chosen.\n\nSo why heartbeat?  \n\nBased on my own views viability makes far more sense.  The point where statistically speaking the fetus could survive without its host.  \n\nBut you know what makes even more sense than that? Leaving the arbitrary decision up to the the person whose body is carrying that fetus.  If that person feels life begins at conception, no one is forcing them to have an abortion. \n\nRemember that statistically speaking, nearly all abortions occur within the first trimester.  Less than 1% of abortions occur in the third trimester and they are exclusively for the health of the mother. People aren't having abortions for the fun of it 7 months into a pregnancy.  \n\nSo why don't we just leave it up to people to figure out on their own views?",

If this happens, it will be a devastating setback for women\u2019s rights, religious freedom and the goal of living in a society where all children are wanted children. I am thrilled to serve a congregation that takes a stand for women, the Jewish people and those of all faiths who cherish freedom. We must never return to the dangerous days of back-alley abortions and the dismantling of the wall of separation between church and state and we will fight back against such efforts.\n\nIf the pro-lie people really want to protect life, we invite them to join us in fighting for universal health care, gun control, protection of our planet, empowerment of women, and a rational religion that builds bridges of understanding among all people rather than trying to impose their views on others by government fiat.\n\nWe thank the many organizations who support us in this effort such as Jews For A Secular Democracy who eloquently expressed their support of our lawsuit as follows:\n\u201cJews for a Secular Democracy Florida believes that religious freedom, including the principle of separation of church and state, is essential for protection of religious minorities. We believe that\nreproductive rights, including the right to abortion, are human rights. We hold that it is unconstitutional to base governmental policy regulating abortion on a Christian-fundamentalist approach. The proper role of government in Florida is not to privilege one set of religious views over others, but to protect each person\u2019s right and ability to make decisions according to their own beliefs and values.\n\nWe congratulate Congregation L\u2019Dor Va-Dor for filing a legal suit that demands an injunction for HB 5 based on its violation of religious freedom. We ask that the circuit court provide immediate relief and temporary and permanent injunction of HB5.\u201d\n\nTo support this fight for freedom of choice contact us at ldorvador.org",

If the Supreme Court rules a fetus is a person and then rules that because of \u201cReligious Liberty\u201d a religion is allowed to take away the rights of that person, it would open the door to a line of reasoning that in many ways would be even worse. \n\nA more compelling argument is that the fetus has a voidable permission to use the mother\u2019s body. If the fetus never sought the mother\u2019s consent, e.g. in the case of rape, then that permission was never granted but was forcibly acquired. If the mother is underage, the is not of age to provide such a binding consent independently.

Ideally we all have religious freedom to practice our religions as we wish, and freedom from religion - freedom to not practice and freedom from someone else\u2019s religious views being forced on you. \n\nBut if an aspect of a religion is deemed illegal, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have religious freedom. I suppose a good example would be genital mutilation of children. If this is considered an important aspect of some religions, but considered illegal under the law of a country, the law wins. We\u2019re not going to make exceptions for certain religious people to be able to mutilate their children. \n\nI am NOT comparing access to abortion to general mutilation. I support abortion access fully. But am I wrong to see the pitfalls of this argument?",

Since practically no religion actually dictates that, exemptions are very rare. \n\nIt really depends what we\u2019re talking about here. Federal government, exemptions are rare. States I believe vary, as do counties, towns, and whatever other municipalities exist with their own rules.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant to what I was saying though because vaccines aren\u2019t illegal. If vaccines were declared illegal and your religion dictated that you must get a vaccine, well that\u2019s a very strange scenario, I don\u2019t know what would happen! \n\nA better scenario would be if your religion dictates that you must spread a deadly virus to other people, but spreading a deadly virus is illegal, the law trumps the religion.\n\nOf course there would be good reason in that scenario. If abortion is illegal, it\u2019s for bullshit reasons, but if the law views it as murder, your religion doesn\u2019t then get to say you\u2019re exempt from the law against murder, feel free to murder all the fetuses you want. (Again- this is not my view!) \n\nSo I would hope this argument will get us somewhere in this fight for reproductive rights, but I\u2019m not sure it will work.",

Is it because you think we should defer to a specific religious book instead of others? Should we take advice from all religious books despite them contradicting each other?\n\nI'm advocating for making decisions based on the merits and supporting data of a claim.",
