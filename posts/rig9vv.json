On a figurative and very literal level. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you have to forgive anyone, though I think holding onto resentment eats away at oneself. And I\u2019d probably be very upset if someone robbed me, too. But I am saying that contextualizing hateful or immoral actions can give us perspective on both the situation and our reaction to it, and that\u2019s in some situations a potentially life saving ability, if not one that can simply lead us towards living a better life where we\u2019re more at ease and less unhappy with ourselves and each other.\n\nAnd on a less abstract level, I guess I just don\u2019t see the point of beating up on that lady. Yeah, her behavior sucks, I would be pissed if she did that to my kid, and she should stop, apologize and go to therapy but she\u2019s only doing that shit because she\u2019s miserable. Shitting on her isn\u2019t gonna make the problem go away.\n\nLocking up robbers isn\u2019t going to end robberies or crime. Understanding the underlying factors that lead to them might, many lifetimes from now. It\u2019s up to us to move collectively towards that understanding. No one will do it for us, and I don\u2019t want to be stuck in a world like this forever.",

Then just hang around waiting for her to turn it back on. The instant she turns it on and walks back to the chalk, you turn it off. She can't be in two places at once. If the faucet's in her house/on private property (and if you're feeling daring), cut the hose with a knife.\n\nBetter to be accused of property damage than assault. If Karen calls the cops saying someone cut her hose, she gets ignored. If she calls saying you \"tRiEd tO KiLl hEr\" then the cops might show up and arrest you just to be safe.",

How the fuck is the very normal scenario of a kid drawing on pavement with chalk suggest it's just a bait to garner a reaction to film? I mean sure, there are shitty parents that do stuff like that, but there's nothing here that seems manufactured by the mom, the kid wasn't scribbling controversial stuff which would be the obvious choice if you're looking to film that kind of thing. Sure the kid may have hammed up the crying a bit to make a bigger impact against the Karen because that's about the only power kids have, it's normal for them to do that too.

I even drew him an eagle (cause he loves eagles) and he was like.. \u201cneat\u201d and tbh I\u2019d be afraid to ask of he still has it today. Doubt it. But my non *swooned* over my artwork and my dad was just like.. oh that\u2019s nice. Honestly it broke my heart. I\u2019m 27 and I still don\u2019t know if or what he\u2019s proud of me for. \n\nAnyways that\u2019s a loaded comment lol but MY POINT is it\u2019s not about a kid crying about chalk drawings getting washed away. It\u2019s about the idea this girl could be the next best artist in the world, but some piece of crap human decided imperfection was in suitable, so while this sweet little girl is just beginning to understand her talent, she\u2019s pushed aside by this (lots of horrible things I can say) type of person to the point she may never again have the confidence to pursue her greatest talent.\n\nI\u2019m not threatening anything. But let\u2019s just say, I\u2019d turn a blind eye if I saw someone beating the hell out of this person. \n\n*fuck them*",

I\u2019ve struggled most of my life and mannerly behavior is so ingrained in me that it\u2019s mostly automatic. People perceive this as a weakness to be exploited (and when u was younger it was); and it\u2019s incredibly painful to have empathy for a populace that\u2019s damn near predatory. That being said, if we abandon our ethics, leave our manners by the wayside to protect ourselves then (imho) all\u2019s lost. We need to educate, empathize, and constantly do better, regardless of the mountains of sh@t that is the current human population. And not because it\u2019s right, or because we should love our fellow man; it\u2019s because that\u2019s what opens the doorways to the beauty of this world and our humanity. Bringing my child up \u201cproper\u201d has created one of the kindest, most thoughtful (as in he ponders situations and there answers), and curious persons I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting. So be brave, and love. ^^",

The only person who has a problem is the downstairs meth addicted neighbor who has declared himself the \"assistant property manager.\" He'll come upstairs, scream st the kids and dump water all over the upper walkway. He's called the cops on the kids before and he's an insufferable asshole. He was yelling at them once when they were drawing in front of my place as I got home. He was screaming that I didnt want them doing that and I would have them kicked out. That is his whole thing, he always claims other people have complained to him about the issue so the parents get mad at each other instead of him.

They're toxic assholes and they repel people from a life saving opportunity. They do this because it's the only thing left in their life to be proud of. It's the only thing in their life that's going on, and they cling on to it like grim death as its their last hill to die on.",

He is absolutely beloved there, the servers all know his name better than mine and constantly give him bacon scraps. He absolutely adores the place and starts going crazy whenever I drive near it.\n\nOne time a couple of days before Christmas I went there with him and there was this women sitting at the entrance to patio. She saw the dog and started screaming that she was allergic and demanding an ADA exemption from the servers. She was at the very entrance to the patio, which was completely empty (it was winter, only people with puppies sat outside--there was plenty of seating inside), so I couldn't get past her to any seating far away from her. And she was just *screaming,* all alone, quoting the ADA and demanding the servers come out. \n\nI walked the pup around the block a couple of times until she was gone then sat down for breakfast. The server told me that all the shut-ins come out and pull shit like that every Christmas because of how alone they are.\n\nPuppy got mounds of bacon scraps that day. Absolute mounds.",

(If I'd had hashish 30 years ago I wouldn't have spent so many wee hours trying to pull my mom's car out of ditches and snowbanks because after a day of school and an evening shift as a busboy there are better ways to unwind than doing doughnuts in a brand-new cul-de-sac surrounded by the foundations and frames of McMansions being birthed, but not where I lived.)\n\nWell, turns out this neighbourhood is not so sterile anymore. The first clue?\n\nSidewalk chalk. Everywhere. Kids are always drawing little pictures, making Hopscotch courts, tallying the number of Hunnish biplanes they downed over Verdun, writing little adorable kid jokes for passers-by...\n\nAnd you know what kids do when they're finished with sidewalk chalk? They make other art. And they go play. In the parks, on the sidewalks, with each other and their families. They ride scooters, they ride skateboards, they ride bikes...and their families do too. Besides all the kids doing kid things, this place is lousy with dog walkers, joggers, and families and friends going for long, chatty walks.\n\nWhere there's sidewalk chalk in a neighbourhood, there's life.^(\\*) It's an indication that people see the outside as extensions of their homes rather than just fa\u00e7ades; a place where they feel secure enough to *live*, rather than just inhabit. I wouldn't trade this for all the pristine driveways and manicured lawns of my youth. Fastidiousness can be used to hide a hell of a lot of dysfunction.\n\nSo let the kids have their chalk, or I'll egg your stucco house in winter like us kids without sidewalk chalk did.\n\n\\*This is all very simplistic and rather Norman Rockwell^(\\*\\*): indicators aren't necessarily causes; there are a lot of things, both structural and organic^(\u2020), that go into the development and maintenance of a healthy neighbourhood; and I wouldn't expect all healthy neighbourhoods to look like mine, whether in another part of town or across the world.\n\n\\*\\*Am sort of baked\n\n\u2020Physically, there is much greater access to amenities and services here. I can get groceries on foot. Not so in 1990. (Well, this part of the neighbourhood didn't exist in 1990. It was all farmers' fields. I used to drive out here in my parents' car to make out with my gf. But the point is that you couldn't do *anything* on foot here back then; even sneak off to make out. And forget busses\u2014there were tonnes of stops slated for *future* service, but none with active routes.) Demographically, there is far more diversity here now, both economic and ethnic. It's no longer a McMansion hell with mostly wealthy white people and a few wealthy East and South Asians sprinkled in. There's more than just alcoholic doctors and lawyers and just-below-C-Suite-executives now. And the teenagers are so much more polite.",

I rented a little bungalow that shared a yard with the landlords 2 other houses, one of which he lived in, the other was rented out. Some of the first tenants were polite, and friendly, but the family that moved in a year before I moved on, were a real piece of work. \n\nThey acted like it was *their* property; constantly encroaching on my space, like storing their crap closer and closer to my building. I asked them to please stop, which they did, for a few days, until they just moved more shit closer to my place. Their dog was constantly shitting in the yard, I stepped in it a few times. I asked them to please pick up the shit, or even better stop letting their dog shit on the property at all (I mean, his kids played in that yard, that's just disgusting). I used to feed a feral cat that lived in the area. They didn't like cats on *their property* so the bowls would magically go missing, or end up over the fence, or across the street. They never owned up to anything when I confronted them, so I installed security cameras to watch my place, and my car. They hated that, which made me happy.\n\nThey also never leashed the dog, it would frequently run into the street. They'd leave it out overnight, neglecting her for hours and hours. There was other issues, but this bitch reminded me of that family. Landlord never did anything, police/animal control didn't care.\n\nSo glad I found a house, because I couldn't take living there any longer.",

I would, however, power wash my entire driveway, and politely ask them not to do it again, if they were to use the chalk on my driveway.\n\nAlthough the only practical use of a driveway is to save my cars from the soil underneath, it is something that I specifically designed to be aesthetically pleasing, as it\u2019s one of the first things that\u2019s noticed when looking at my house.\n\nI obviously wouldn\u2019t care if I still had the outdated cement driveway, covered in cracks, but that\u2019s no longer the case.",

OCD from a young age was majorly exacerbated by an overly controlling and abusive step-parent in my early years. \n\nNowadays, it's BAD! I'm one of the best builders in my department at work, but they don't like letting me train people because the imperfections in their work gives me major anxiety and causes me to lash out at them sometimes, no matter how hard I try not to. I have a co-worker who just avoids me like the plague now after I was the one that trained him. Anyone I haven't been responsible for training doesn't understand his aversion as I'm generally very likeable otherwise. \n\nThankfully, I recognized all my various mental illness issues and realized ahead of time that I would make a terrible fucking parent because of them. Also, I basically raised my little sister and took care of both my parents and my grandparents growing up, so I was fucking done taking care of people by the time I hit adulthood anyway.\n\nSome people just shouldn't have kids. Also, some of us shouldmt be teachers for full grown adults, either. :(",

Their responses to later, comprehensive studies are in essence [simple denial](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31070406/). In short, that\u2019s a good lesson on cherry-picking.\n\nThe study and the group behind it have been criticized for inaccurate results; newer and more comprehensive meta-studies specifically on \u201clight\u201d and non-abusive (without the objects, non-insuring spanking, usually palm swats on the butt) have arrived at the opposite conclusions. \n\nSee [Gershoff et al.](https://sci-hub.mksa.top/10.1037/fam0000191) (numerous studies), \n\n[MacKenzie et. al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24144718/), \n\n[Heilmann et. al (2021)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34197808/), \n and others, and others, and others.",

It didn't have much access to the outside world, and thus didn't have knowledge the rest of us have.\n\nFor reasons I won't get into here, they believed that 2+2=5. They had been taught this for over 2,000 years.\n\nWell, one day a man comes to visit the village. And after staying there for a day, he tried to tell the people that they were wrong. \n\nAt first, they were offended. They told him to apologize and leave, but he didn't. He kept trying to convince them that 2 and 2 were 4, not 5.\n\nBut they wouldn't listen. They knew they were right. Hundreds of years and dozens of ancestors could not be wrong. So they killed the man, believing him to be nothing more than a liar.\n\nNow I hope this helps you out in the future my friend. I know it did me",

Or is this boy disabled?\n\nThe only real life story I know where a person truly did not know that hurting others was bad, that person was both severely autistic and intellectually disabled and thought that kicking his children was okay. He didn't change his mind by being kicked by someone else, but because a social worker convinced him (I believe). He immediately deeply regretted kicking his children once he understood that it was not okay and never did so again.\n\nI believe it is on Reddit somewhere, I think in r/raisedbyautistics or else in r/raisedbynarcissists (the mother was narcissistic and manipulated her husband).\n\nBut in any case, the boy in your story definitely has some sort of mental disability. Possibly (probably?) a fictional one.",

I was standing at the counter in a large chain store with something in my hands to purchase when the store assistant called the very attractive, much younger girl behind me forward to serve. \n\n>It was as though I wasn\u2019t even standing there. Unfortunately, I was buying a gift for someone that was only available at that store, so I had to suffer the embarrassment of the store assistant saying, 'Oh, I didn\u2019t see you there,' when they clearly saw me waiting there to be served.\n\n>The older I become, the less I see myself everywhere - especially in popular culture. It feels a lot like when we used to say to young girls that you can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see. \n\n>Over the years, I have noticed this in advertising as well. Once upon a time, marketers were literally falling over themselves for my consumer dollars. But these days, unless I am in the market for incontinence products or Botox, it has all but disappeared. (Funnily enough though, I actually have significantly more disposable income to spend these days.)",

If a person is \"evil\" inside, they feel the need for interfering for a negative reaction. It is the only power they feel in their powerless, miserable lives, and it doesn't matter from whom, or from what, allows them to act out in a vindictive, *evil* manner. Regarding this video, *it doesn't matter* if she made a *little girl cry*: all that matters to this petty, powerless, evil woman is that she made *someone* (anyone) cry.\n\nOf course she recorded the video and uploaded it herself. She's getting a reaction out of this subreddit community, and to her, it doesn't matter if all the attention she is receiving is negative: all that matters is that she gets a reaction. It is the only power she has.\n\nAlso, I stopped the video from playing the instant it started because I didn't want to see an evil woman being mean to a little girl.",

Recently I moved in with my mom cause we'd both had a rough go of it with quarantine. I discovered, to my horror, that she'd developed a lot of these qualities. For example: She was very concerned with a neighbors dog peeing on a tree that wasn't even on her property but the city parkway in front of her house.\n\n Whenever I'd ask her to explain why she felt so strongly about things that didn't matter. I was \"being mean.\" When I suggested, *very* gently, that she might want to get some professional help, (I'm quite certain she was severely, clinically depressed.) she and her new bf decided I needed to move out. \n\nTl;dr: I think this behavior stems out of depression and loneliness. I'm definitely not saying we should reward shitty behavior, but reaching out to elderly neighbors before this happens can go a long way.",

It should be things like \u201cdon\u2019t have a garage sale in your front yard 24/7/365 (legit had an old neighbor who did that.  They never brought their shit in and all of it was ruined from the elements but they\u2019d occasionally add new junk to their \u201cyard sale\u201d inventory.). The HOA can dictate what kind of mailbox you can have (my current house has a brick mailbox per the HOA rules), what colors you can paint your house (basically anything neutral or earth-toned is okay.  One neighbor got a new roof in an unapproved color but the HOA basically said \u201cit\u2019s not ugly so we give no fucks\u201d.) \n\nWe\u2019re not allowed to have above-ground pools, livestock, or anything that might be considered a nuisance to the neighbors.   (Ie feeding the wildlife to the point you\u2019ve basically attracted rats and now we all have to hire exterminators.  Thanks a lot, Elaine!)\n\nThere\u2019s pros and cons, but most redditors violently hate HOAs.  Ours is pretty chill and uses the fees to maintain several duck ponds with fountains, acres of open land for kids/leashes dogs to play in, and decorating for Christmas.   They\u2019re not at all strict about modifying your house/property and don\u2019t squander the money.",

                      "text": "Yep. We got threatened with fines because my Baja was parked on the street.  This was due to having just moved which meant our garage was filled with boxes and other junk. We were told that trucks weren't allowed to be seen because only I guess the Karen thought they were a sign of being low class or something to that effect. I distinctly remember them referencing how it was only okay for the gardeners to use them because they were hired help or some other nonsense.\n\nThe fact that the Baja was a converted Outback with a tiny truckbed didn't assuage them. Of course they had NO issue with the F150 our neighbors parked directly across from my car. But no, we had to shuffle all the boxes in the garage to hide my faux-truck while that actual truck sat there and never moved.\n\nThe day we left that HOA was incredibly liberating. Unfortunately their bullshit hasn't stopped. Family friends moved into that community last year and bought a house with a gorgeous red door. Why is the red door important? Last month they got a fine warning over it because it was 'ruining' the look of the community which 'the HOA took fairly seriously'. This door has been there for over a year, hell was likely there before the original owners wanted to sell, but NOW it's a problem?\n\nJokes on them though, those old family friends were discussing changing the door right up until this happened. Now they're keeping it out of spite. And because they are pretty independently wealthy they can eat the fine with no hardship. I'd have loved to have the same amount of disposable income but seeing someone finally give that HOA the finger has been amazing.\n\nEdit: Cleaned up typos.",

We live on the opposite side so our neighbors complain when our car is in front of their yard. Luckily we are the last house in our neighborhood so I just park on the wrong side just off our property where the other neighborhood has no HOA and they have no power over it, it's the only fuck you I have. Luckily our HOA is pretty lenient, it's the neighbors that don't want a car parked in front of their yard and I don't blame them. Now our biggest problem is our older neighbor has to back out his giant Cadillac of his driveway and sucks at backing out and had complained and even hit a car parked there once but he still offered to pay for it",

HOAs keep people from doing ridiculous nonsense like painting houses weird colors and building additions or other things that can de-value other people's property. They maintain common areas and in general maintain and improve home values. It is really nice to have well maintained common areas and other things taken care of at a community level. Yes, some of the time, HOAs, like any organization, go rogue and power hungry, but in general my experience with HOAs has been very positive. Occasionally annoying, yes, but like, you know what you are getting into when you buy a house in a HOA neighborhood. Or, my tl;dr, the HOA isn't there to keep me from doing weird stuff, it's to keep all my neighbors from doing weird stuff.\n\nedit: I would add most counties with major suburban centers also enforce many HOA type rules anyway. So the whole \"NO HOA OMG THEY ARE THE WORST\" is a shell game anyway. Many counties have similarly strict, although less scrupulously enforced, rules. This is Reddit though, most people reading this don't own homes anyway.",

This is not subjective, and is not a matter of debate. HOAs are governed by the people who own homes in the neighborhood. If the person to whom I responded doesn't attend the meetings, they're letting someone else make decisions for them. If they don't review the **legally required disclosures** that an HOA puts out every year, it's their own fault that they don't know where their money goes.\n\n>Frankly, you very much sound like a someone that works in managing an HOA.\n\nI don't \"manage\" an HOA (though I have lived and voted in multiple). I know you think that was supposed to be an insult, but all you've accomplished here is proving your own ignorance.\n\nIf I were the kind of HOA president you think you're accusing me of being, why would I be encouraging people to educate themselves and get involved?

Yeah buildings like this have a sinking fund you pay into annually that pays for the roof. There is an organisation that pays for the upkeep of the building and so forth. It sounds like the HOAs in the US are much more involved though, and you [have them for townhouses too](https://www.google.com/search?q=Townhouse&sxsrf=AOaemvJcrKKvCTc2nMW6puzQe9wDQWAQbg:1639771465923&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjHtPTd0Ov0AhXQYcAKHdiFCL4Q_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=1920&bih=975&dpr=1). For townhouses it is extremely rare in the UK. As I said, people are just responsible for the upkeep of their property and to a large degree can do what they want.",

There are rules, like all the front doors are black and you aren't allowed to paint your portion of the house purple or whatever.

Minimal fee, not too good with snow removal, but whatever. \n\nTwo years ago, some property management company took over. Fees went up. Letters were sent out to homeowners complaining about every blessed thing - trash cans visible from the street, almost any plants in a flowerbed were weeds, trash found on communal property were somehow the responsibility of a specific homeowner (neighbor of mine). \n\nEveryone is so fed up. We generally just ignore any letters, because whomever is complaining obviously doesn't live here. Fuck HOA's though. I hope yours doesn't go south like ours did.",

                                  "text": "Ga. woman fights charges in son\u2019s jaywalking death\n10 years ago\n\n\nRaquel Nelson (AP Photo)\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Raquel Nelson faced a dilemma after she was convicted of vehicular homicide in the jaywalking-related death of her 4-year-old son: She could serve a year of probation for the conviction or risk a new trial and lengthier penalty for a crime she doesn\u2019t believe she committed.\n\nOn Tuesday, though, Nelson picked a third option. Her attorney asked the Georgia Court of Appeals to dismiss all criminal charges against Nelson, arguing that prosecutors didn\u2019t have enough evidence to charge her with any crime involving the death of her son A.J., who was struck by a hit-and-run driver as Nelson led him across the street.\n\n\u201cThis was crossing the street with other people to get home,\u201d defense attorney Steve Sadow told the three-judge panel. \u201cIt was unfortunate. And it was tragic. But that doesn\u2019t make it a crime.\u201d\n\nNelson was charged after A.J. was struck by a van as they jaywalked across a busy five-lane road in suburban Atlanta, and the case against her sparked outrage from activists who flooded the judge\u2019s office with letters and gathered thousands of signatures on an online petition to support her.\n\nShe and her three children had just stepped off a bus at a stop in Marietta late on the night of April 10, 2010 to return to her apartment complex across the street. Nelson led her children to a median instead of walking to a crosswalk three-tenths of a mile away, according to court records, when her daughter darted safely across the street and her son tried to follow.\n\nThat\u2019s when he was fatally struck by an oncoming van driven by Jerry Guy, who had been drinking earlier in the day while taking pain medication, was partially blind and had two previous hit-and-run convictions from 1997, records show.\n\nThe decision to prosecute Guy, who fled the scene, was an easy one. He pleaded guilty to hit-and-run charges and was sentenced to six months in prison. But the move to charge Nelson, the grieving mother devastated by her son\u2019s death, struck many as an overreach.\n\nProsecutors didn\u2019t make any arguments at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, an unusual move that surprised observers. But the Cobb County Solicitor\u2019s Office said in a motion that Guy wasn\u2019t to blame for A.J.\u2019s death and that he was only charged because he fled the scene after the accident.\n\n\u201cThe officers determined that A.J. was killed because his mother walked with him into the roadway under unsafe conditions,\u201d the filing said. \u201cAnother driver could have just as easily been the one that hit A.J. In fact, there is evidence that another driver did almost hit the group after the collision.\u201d\n\nShe was convicted in July of second-degree vehicular homicide, reckless conduct and jaywalking and sentenced to a year of probation. But she accepted a judge\u2019s offer of a new trial instead.\n\nThe reckless conduct charge was later dropped, but Sadow and Nelson came to court on Tuesday to request the other two charges, both misdemeanors, be dismissed as well. If the charges aren\u2019t dropped and the case goes to trial, Nelson could face up to three years in prison.\n\nSadow doesn\u2019t want the case to get that far. He argued that prosecutors didn\u2019t have enough evidence to charge her with any criminal wrongdoing in crossing the street, and urged the court to find that the death was caused by the van\u2019s driver and not his client\u2019s unfortunate decision.\n\n\u201cShe has to live with this the rest of her life,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s critical that there has to be a determination that she did nothing criminally wrong.\u201d\n\nThe court isn\u2019t likely to make a decision for months, but Nelson said she can\u2019t have closure until it does.\n\n\u201cThe waiting is very hard, but hopefully this will come to an end,\u201d she said.\n___\nThis article was provided by The Associated Press Wire.

Miraculously she was fine, as was her car despite the rubber scuffed all over the fender. She even got his license plate.

To anyone that might want to say \"well it's her word against his\" well, it's pretty telling if one person is visibly shaken and calls the police and the other drives home as if nothing happened. The hit and run was the crime but there are many ways fault for the \"accident\" could've been determined. \n\nThis kind of encapsulates one of the glaring problems with the police.

But not yielding for a pedestrian is also a crime and will definitely be prosecuted if a cop witnesses it.   Pedestrians, even jaywalking ones, have the right of way throughout the U.S.  Now, that doesn't mean they don't have a responsibility to be careful -- they do -- and they'll certainly be picked up if they do something like crossing an interstate or jumping out in front of a car without giving it any chance to avoid hitting them.  But this woman wasn't accused of being careless.  I can't see how the prosecutors had a leg to stand on in  arguing she was culpable to the degree of a felony.",

Crosswalks should be placed where people will cross if there\u2019s a bus stop on one side of the road and a huge apartment complex on the other side of the road it\u2019s safe to assume that people are going to cross there. It\u2019s so much easier to just blame the mother for poor infrastructure sure, laziness. whatever",

HOAs have a higher asshole:nice ratio than cities, have you pay fees on top of your exisiting municipal taxes/fees, will penalize violations as a first act more readily, and you're subject to city ordinances still anyway if your HOA is more lenient in an area. Anger at getting monetary consequences from your neighbor can also fester more than some City Hall drone doing the same. \n\nMain post:\n\nI was just telling you that, yes, the city can essentially send the lawn patrol and ask, then demand, then fine you until you clean up. I jumped right to fines because you made it sound inherently ineffectual, but they won't generally do that without prior warnings or a pattern of bad conduct. Like I said above, my city isn't fining me if I haven't cleared the snow in a day or two, but if it's sitting for a week I'm probably getting a letter.\n\nAs for a city or an HOA doing exactly the same thing, I'd say the city is going to be much more lenient and understanding in their behavior. City ordinances are also going to be more common sense in my expereince, whereas HOAs can have some odd restrictions in them. I'm a civil engineer and have worked with several municipalities as part of a consultant firm and ~50 HOAs. The city officials in charge of this sort of thing have 9 out of 10 times been more competent and less malicious than the HOA heads when it comes to interpreting and enforcing requirements.\n\nYou'll still get some bureaucrats on the city side that are on a power trip, but you *really* feel it with the small-time power of a few assholes that **control** their block rather than assholes that are overseeing the whole town. These people are on your street every day, oftentimes all day since it's a lot of SAHMs and retirees, looking for infractions. Whereas city crews will do some occasional spot checks or come out to areas they've gotten complaints about. The whole \"warning before fines\" system is less in play, and any warnings come with a huge dose of passive aggression. There's also the fact that you're paying HOA fees on top of already paying taxes and fees to the municipality to cover these services in the first place. And if a city ordinance is more stringent than the rules of an HOA, the city ordinance takes precedent anyway. \n\nAlso, say Dickhead Darrell across the street fines me due to some inane HOA restriction. Now I have to see his dumb face day after day; that's going to keep my anger going. Versus a similar fine from some Unknown Dickhead down at city hall for an equally inane municipal code violation. I can cuss into the ether at them as much as I want and presumably not have to interact with them again. \n\nAnd yeah, people are usually mad at the shitty people in HOAs rather than the HOAs themselves, but they have a real knack for attracting said assholes.",

As a way of coming to an agreement, the developer pays for all the improvements, builds the road, builds the sidewalks, puts water, sewer, gas, electricity in the ground, and also builds one or two detention or retention basins for the purpose of offsetting the impervious cover in an effort to reduce flooding impacts off-site.\n\nOn top of that, the town requires that all these private improvements be maintained in perpetuity by the developer, which requires that developer to set up an HOA, which all the future property owners will be required to pay into in order to provide maintenance to all these improvements.\n\nThis differs vastly from homes that were developed on streets maintained and constructed by the town.  My town plows my streets, my town (or an appropriate authority) is required  to  maintain the electrical, the gas, the sewer, the water up to a certain point on my property.  \n\nSo tell me what about that is racist?",

If a town can pass off responsibility in an effort to save money, it will do that 10 times out of 10.\n\nAnd glass houses reflect, certain plants are invasive, too much coverage causes flooding, and those conditions do need some regulation, and in the case of a subdivision governed by an HOA the homes are typically on properties that differ from the standard in town and so it makes sense to have a separate set of rules to govern those properties, which in turn leads to the town saying they want nothing to do with it because they don't want to spend that money.\n\nI'm with you though. I live in a house on a public road governed by my town, and if I wanted it black with pink shutters nobody could do anything about it, and that's the way it should be. Unfortunately, subdivisions exist, and with them come lots of maintenance and costs associated with those maintenance, and I just don't know that it's fair to burden a town with those costs. But I say I don't know, because a town could absolutely figure out a way to levee tax to cover the costs, but when people hear about taxes they lose their minds and politicians lose their jobs, which kinda leaves us in this gray area that I'm getting at.",

The most common is to levy fines backed up with the power of a lien against real property that will be enforced by the state courts.\n\nAn HOA can't have you arrested for violating their rules. They can fine you large amounts of money, and if you don't pay they can eventually take your property.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned that's pretty legally binding.\n\nHere is the actual sauce for the state of Minnesota:\n\n[https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/515b](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/515b)\n\nThere is quite a bit to pour through. The HOA has to be properly formed and run. They have rules to follow. When you purchase your property you sign a contract that includes state, county, local, and HOA requirements.\n\nPeople that have \"won\" against an HOA have usually done so because the HOA did not follow the rules.

We had a full time maintenance guy, a landscaping and pool service. These three things ate up 80% of the budget so it left very little to hire a lawyer and take owners to court so after a bunch of threatening letters you just had to say \u201ctake a hike\u201d and it ended there.

Just pointing out home owners bitching about HOAs are really bitching at themselves because all the homeowners ARE the HOA.   Full disclosure I live in an HOA and my wife was sick of the Karens so she volunteered me to run for the BOD. Four years later I got the 30yr old bylaws and covenants updated and passed making it almost impossible for Karen to bully fellow owners.

                      "text": "A bit less snarky response:\n\nAn HOA is a governing entity for a subdivision.  Here in the US, a subdivision is generally a large tract of land that was purchased by a developer as a unit and subdivided into hundreds of housing plots.  When the subdivision is established, bylaws are created that set up the standards for how the subdivision will be maintained.  This may include rules like requiring upkeep on houses (no peeling paint, falling down fences, etc.), whether you can park in the street, what sort of signage you can put in your yard, the number of pets you can have, prohibiting livestock, etc.\n\nWhen you purchase a house in a subdivision, you're required to sign a document stating that you will adhere to the bylaws.  This is enforceable by and can result in liens against your house to recover the expense of the HOA remediating issues that haven't been dealt with by the homeowner.\n\nThe goal of the bylaws is to ensure that the value of your house, which is a huge investment, is maintained.  If you spend $500,000 on a home then go to sell it and can't because you have some asshat move in next door, paints their house bright pink, keeps farm animals and never bothers to mow their lawn, that's a significant hit to your own wallet.\n\nThe HOA itself is typically made up of homeowners in the subdivision (hence the name \"homeowners' association\") who are voted in.  Enforcement of and changes to bylaws are determined by the HOA by vote, typically during a monthly meeting of homeowners from the community.\n\nAs you can see, the \"Karens\" of the community are more likely to not only attend these meetings and vote, but also will likely end up on the board.  With this level of power, they tend to go overboard, expecting everyone's property to be perfect.  Meanwhile, most homeowners can't be bothered to attend the HOA meetings, so their power goes unchecked.",

OTARD rule, over-the-air reception devices rule, prohibits laws, regulations, or restrictions imposed by state, local, or pribate entities (hoa and landlords) that impair the ability of antenna users to install maintain or use ota devices. There is a little bit nuance. They can impose reasonable restrictions that do not inhibit the quality of service, cause unreasonable cost or unreasonably delay service. That part is mostly for the hoa or simgle family home rentals but not necessarily attached townhome communities. Landlords of multidwelling units (apartment buildings, duplexes etc) can restrict antenna installation to exclusive use areas, decks, a balcony, window etc if you have no exclusive use areas other than your living space you may up a creek depending the us/service. In attached townhomesl communities or condos its tricky, often times you dont actually own the roof the siding and sometimes not even the inside of your walls, even though you may be financially responsible for them. For example on a town home that has no deck, they cannot say no to an antenna, they tell younuse something like a non pen, or something similar to a comm deck. \n\nIve been working radio sercives for a really long time and this comes up often. Things to consider, a landlord doesnt have to renew a lease, an hoa can use selectove enforcement against you and hold you to a T of the contract. So if you troll, cover your ass.",

Made sure nobody was even hanging on the curb or on the sidewalk. Got a damn notice saying we\u2019re not allowed to park two cars in our own fucking driveway. We OWNED the condo and the driveway. All hell broke loose, they retracted their dumbass statement after we took photos and asked where the fuck the violation was, they gave some soft excuses about how we\u2019re not allowed to park two cars in a driveway, but apologized after getting their asses handed to them for being petty, because their driveways can\u2019t comfortably accommodate two vehicles. This was the straw that broke that camel\u2019s back, my partner got fed up. He started taking pictures of her letting her dogs take a shit in the neighborhood without picking it up, among other petty stuff she does that violates HOA regulations. Next time she tried to say something, he showed her the photos followed by the words : \u201cDon\u2019t look at us, don\u2019t talk to us, don\u2019t breathe in our direction. If you see us walking in the neighborhood, turn around and walk the other way\u201d haven\u2019t heard a peep from HOA Karen since lol. People like these are bullies, they get one taste of power and abuse the hell out of it. Sometimes you gotta match that crazy energy, they back down once they realize they can\u2019t bully you.",

We have 6 parks, including two on an inland lake and one on lake Huron and a dog park, also on the lake.  A large pavillion,  suitable for large events, and a clubhouse.   \n\nThe rules are super workable, like the shed thing... not asking permission to have it, just ensuring that it is behind the house and - in this neighborhood - made of approved materials. \n\nThe two HOAs that I have lived in are in rural settings.

Every first floor appartment has a backyard and a parking accessible by an alleyway.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's no HOA but a lady has taken upon herself the task of managing the alley ... She's been living here all her life and she's 70ish. It started informally just because she's always there and speaks to everyone, she would match people who wanted to rent their parking space to people who were looking for a space. Then over the years, she became the \"parking lady\" and she kind of built her ego on that task. Like she would get upset at neighbours who wouldn't go through her to find someone to rent their parking space (\"I have 15 people waiting on my list for ages! How entitled they feel renting their parking spot to a family member that doesn't use it everyday!). She \"manages\" a group of neighbours who pay a contractor to plow the alleyway in the winter (the city doesn't) and gets mad when people who don't have cars dont' want to be part of the group. Then she got in a crusade against cycling paths and \"[green alleyways](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/travel/montreal-green-alleyways-take-visitors-backstage.html)\" - a trend in my city to reduce the accessibility of alleyways to cars, remove concrete and plant vegetation - because these were anti-car follies. That became a tipping point when she became more and more a \"get off my lawn!\" type, but for a whole block. Now she's just the neighbourhood hag.",

Mind you, this is a fucking trailer park, not some kind of exclusive mansion neighborhood with a golf course.\n\nSo we get a letter informing us that we were being fined $75 for having a visible trash can on our property in this small town Indiana trailer park. Turns out, lots of people were being hit with these, because trailers usually don\u2019t have attached garages, and many people who live here are older or disabled and can\u2019t be dragging cans around to their back yard.\n\nI myself couldn\u2019t move them very easily at the time because I had a herniated disc that was keeping me fairly bedridden, but I gamely tried putting it behind my car in the carport so that it wouldn\u2019t be AS visible.\n\nI came home to find it dragged into the back yard.\n\nI marched that fucking thing down my driveway, off the curb, about a foot into the street.

          "text": "I moved out of my last neighborhood because of the following story (and I mean it, I literally listed my house the next weekend and it was under contract in 7 hours for 25k more than I listed it for, this was at the peak of the covid real estate boom last year) ......\n\nI have a jetski.  A 2021 Waverunner FX Cruiser SVHO (giving those details so you can look it up, it is VERY nice, not some sitting in the backyard all rusted out skis)\n\nI keep it garage parked.  And my truck (4Runner) is parked in front of the garage door that houses the ski.  Almost everyone in the neighborhood has at least one car parked in the driveway.\n\nSo one Saturday I hooked up the ski, rolled it out into the driveway just beyond the door, attached to my truck, and washed it.  Garage door closed so spray did not go into the garage.  After washing it and drying it off, I went inside to get ready for a long day on the lake.  Changing clothes, waiting for the wife to get ready (why does it take women so long even for something like the lake?).  Making some sandwiches and getting some snacks together to pack into the ski etc.  Total about 2 hours or so.\n\nWe have a great day on the lake.  End of that part of the story.\n\nFew days later I get a violation letter in the mail.  The letter is quoting a code section of our bylaws about parking.  The violation was for my \"boat parked in the driveway\".  It told me that we are not allowed to store boats or other recreational vehicles in our driveway.  So even though I was not \"storing\" it there, the violation was still contradicting itself.  \n\nThe very first line of the code section is (doing this from memory so a few words might be off) \"Vehicle is hereby defined as ... blah blah blah, car, truck, SUV, boat, motorcycle, RV, blah blah blah or any gasoline powered vehicle.\"\n\nThen they quoted a sub-section to me about \"no vehicles may be parked in the street or driveway continuously without use for more than 48 hours.\" blah blah blah\n\nSo I called them and said \"So reading the bylaws here it says more than 48 hours but my PWC was only in my driveway for 2 hours and it was hitched to my truck the entire time\"\n\nThe Karen HOA manager replied \"You can't park boats in your driveway, period.\"\n\nI replied \"It was not parked though, it was hooked up to my truck to go to the lake\"\n\nShe just repeated \"It doesn't matter, you cannot park boats in your driveway\"\n\nSo I went a different route ...\n\n\"Well let me ask you this, can I park my truck in my driveway?  Because if not, there are a ton of violation letters that basically need to go to every house in the neighborhood\"\n\nShe replied \"Yes, residents can park cars or trucks in their driveway.  I am just telling you that you are not allowed to leave a boat in your driveway\"\n\nI said \"Did you happen to read the first sentence of the bylaws that you quoted to me in your letter?  The part that defines 'vehicles' to include cars, trucks, boats, and any gas powered vehicle?\"\n\nShe got real quiet, and then just totally Karen'ed me with \"Look, you can't park a boat in the driveway, that's all there is to it.\"\n\nSo I Karen'ed her right back with \"Well let me tell you this.  I will stick with the bylaws that state a boat is a vehicle.  So now I am actually going to park it in my driveway rather than my garage.  Feel free to take me to court over it, I will be throwing away your letter.  And I will be contacting a real estate agent as soon as we hang up.  I have no desire to live in a neighborhood run by such a terrible management company.\"\n\nShe hung up on me!\n\nI put my house up for sale and moved.  And have not been happier.  Love my new neighborhood.  Great neighbors.  Friendly area.  And thanks to the hot real estate market (this was when things were going for more than they should but some stuff was still for sale at reasonable prices) I managed to leave a 20 year old 2100 sq ft house and moved into a 1 year old 2600 sq ft house and my mortgage is 40 dollars cheaper here!!!!\n\nThanks Karen!  Would not have moved if not for your stupidity!",

I\u2019ve dealt with these old ladies before when I was young. I never had to shove them to the ground but they always got physical first. A mere gentle pushback from me and they\u2019d go off on how I was a rude kid and I should respect my elders blah blah. Just like every bully who tried Messing with me and I responded. There\u2019s always a shocked reaction but nothing ever escalated to a fight because these people only look to prey on those they think weak. Once they see you pose a challenge they back off.  And if a fight happens well so be it man but you gotta learn to step up for yourself. Again your little girl is crying and all you\u2019re doing is recording, teaching her it\u2019s okay to let people treat you like shit while you stand there and take it.\n\nMy first point was if police will help the mom then so be it.

Washing chalk from pavement does not warrant such a drastic physical reaction, that would be completely insane behavior that is ridiculously out of proportion to the \"crime\". \n\nI also think the mother here is a clown for standing around filming her kid and encouraging this old lady with her antics. The better thing would have tried to have a rational chat with the woman, in a non-antagonistic manner, and if that didn't work just be the bigger person and take the kid inside. That would be a better lesson than resorting to violence like some sort of wannabe vigilante or filming what would have been a minor incident for internet points.",

With 2nd grade aged girls this won't apply but it may make you feel better if the issue was concerning standing vs sitting. \n\nAlmost all women at some point in their lives willing wear or are expected to wear high heels. These are always uncomfortable so maybe you can find some comfort in that. (Lol)\n\nAlso, with the article you read, that could be true. Over a ~30 year span, males committed something like 90% of all homicides. The victims were the majority men but obviously women too. That leaves 10% of homicides done by women. \n\nSo although it appears that women can *more easily* potentially *ruin a guys life* as you say (you probably mean financially or reputation?), men ***literally and overwhelmingly*** take the actual lives of women (and men). Women are more likely to be raped, more likely to be physically beaten. Men are more likely to go to jail/prison - true, they also commit a majority of the crimes.",

Men usually don\u2019t and must \u2018man up\u2019.\n\nAhh okay, my experience was different. If boys were messing around, rough housing, teasing, bullying, etc. It usually fell into the category of *boys with be boys* and *if he's mean to you, then he likes you*. Boys usually got 2-3 warnings or passes for poor behavior, whereas girls were expected to behave better and were quicker told that their behavior was *disappointing*.\n\nIf you are talking about men raping men, I've never heard or seen anyone (except for you rn) say that men who are raped should enjoy it/stop pretending. Being raped anally **physically** hurts no matter who you are unless you have some medically condition where you have damaged or weakened muscle near your anus or a prolapsed anus or something like that.\n\nEven if for whatever reason it doesn't physically hurt, being raped negatively effects everyone mentally and emotionally \n\nIf you are talking about men being raped by women, I have seen people react to it differently. Some women don't believe that women can actually rape a man. Usually though, what I see is other men saying things like *\"teachers/babysitters didn't look like that when I was a kid\" and \"high fives\", \"this guy is so lucky\", \"he will always have bragging rights that he hit that\"* etc. \n\nMen are usually the ones to discount other men when they say they've been raped by a woman. Women tend to sympathize/empathize more with the **male victim** when it involves a woman pedophile teacher/babysitter etc. because women often experience some sort of sexual trauma at very young ages.",

That is the fastest way to solidify hateful viewpoints in your mind. This is true for women who are sexist towards men, people who are homophobic, etc, too. \n\nThere was a study that said something about how the more we have interactions with others, the less racist we are towards them (I'm totally butchering this.. but that's kinda what it said). Seek out female-majority spaces (that don't hate men), really try to understand that they're just like you, etc. If you find one where they're bashing on men, you will just reinforce the negative views!\n\nYou can even tell them your issues if you'd want. I feel like the story you mentioned deserves an r/offmychest post on its own. Please don't sink into the hatred - it's so, so easy, because when you go looking for things, you find them. I know that it's really, really hard for me to not hate those who are opposite politically from me. It's just something I struggle with - but it's something we work towards, yknow? (Though this is different, they choose to vote for things vs a gender or race or sexuality where you're born that way. But I digress).\n\nGood luck, friend.",

Learning that from my therapist actually blew my mind. It\u2019s made a huge impact on how I parent and just how I deal w my issues in general.

I came home in tears and a totally dirty jacket\u2026 as I told mum what happened ( back then thinking I did something really wrong because why else should I be punished like that?), she stormed out and had a intense discussion with said neighbor.

Then I paused and asked myself why it was wrong.  Why not color their own playhouse?  It won\u2019t hurt the plastic.  Why not color the steps?  They actually looked bright and cheery for once!\n\nLuckily, all my kids saw was raised eyebrows in surprise and then my face soften when I said, \u201cWow!  Look at all these great pictures!\u201d  They were beaming with pride.  I was so happy I didn\u2019t default to my own learned experience.",

A karen started bad mouthing the little boy and threatened she will remouve everything. So I just got a few barrier walls and put it only arround his drawings and infront of her driveway. It was awesome seeing her have to park 3 streets away and walk to her car every morning. :) i still havent removed them. Its been 3 weeks since we were done there.\nSorry for grammar english isnt my first language but I hope you understand what I mean.",

So the idea of it being an eyesore is ridiculous. I'm sure no one (sane and not a cu\u03c0t) would think a child's drawing would defile that ugly blacktop. \n\nTrying to see this old Karen's point. I'd understand if a kid brought out the chalk inside a museum, temple, UNESCO world heritage site, etc. This is a bubbly, ugly ass parking lot. Sidewalk chalk is how they advertise the product and a sidewalk is demonstrably a better looking place than this broke ass asphalt.\n\nThen the way she sprays the hose around the kids chalk. You're not slick. Trying to spray around the drawing first like this is the regular cleaning you do. Like this is your normal routine to keep this ugly pavement clean. Ain't nobody falling for that. This woman got joy out of this. She heard this little kid plead and cry to leave it alone and she was satisfied. Bet she smoked a cigarette and had a drink when she went inside.\n\n\"We have to live here.\" Bitch you can't \n live with yourself, that's why you get joy from the tears of children.

You can't call the cops on her for just spraying it away though, like you were saying to the child.\n\n\nKeep in mind that while she wouldn't have a leg to stand on against you, that the owner COULD have you charged with defacing property, but it is very very unlikely. \n\nFirst of all you would need the owner to be that much of a petty person to call the cops on you, then you would need the dispatcher  to be convinced to send someone over for someone chalking the parking lot, then you would need to responding cop to not think this is a huge waste of their time, then you would need a prosecutor or lawyer to also think this is worth their time and finally you would need to get a judge that was a big enough of a old grouch to ignore all logic in order to get in trouble.",

Your kid's upset and you're just encouraging it by filming them and the destruction of their work just to try and shame the Karen?? Telling a child 'we'll call the police if she touches us' or something. You're creating an entitled kid. Sure, this sucks but it's not the end of the world and if that's not their property, it aint cop-worthy (that's Karenish, frankly). Console your child, encourage them to keep being creative and let them draw elsewhere ***and*** teach them things aren't always gonna go their way in life and they should learn to not let others' axns that they don't like destroy their joy when they act like jerks. Life lesson opportunity lost here, IMO.",

They just do naughty things and if some people can\u2019t bare them and scold them, people will just hate those people because they break children\u2019s little fragile heart, which is so stupid. The child in the video just vandalized and people now are against the lady. If it was MY carpark and I keep it clean then a child came and vandalized it I would be mad too, even though I would try to keep it for myself and not smash kids. I mean, the lady was aggressive, but why don\u2019t we talk about the child\u2019s behavior. Don\u2019t her parents teach her not to vandalize? Especially in public area and things which don\u2019t belong to her?\nThis kid reminds me of two of my cousins. Every time their parents take them to relatives\u2019 house, the kids just run in the house finding whatever they can \u201cplay\u201d with. \u201cPlay\u201d here means \u201cdestroy\u201d. Then the parents just like aww our children are so energetic. And no one can teach them because whenever someone tell the children to stop (not even scolding), their parents are like \u201cthey are just children they don\u2019t know anything. Just let them be\u201d blah blah. And after they leave, my house is a mess, things are broken. I always lock myself in my room and tell mom I am sleeping when that family come to my house. Then I know another kid who came to my friend\u2019s house and killed her hamster out of curiosity. Then guest what. Both the kid\u2019s parents and her parents told her that \u201cit is just a hamster\u201d. Haha hilarious. And guest what they told that naughty child. NOTHING. As if what the child did there was not wrong. They just assumed \u201cshe/he is just a kid\u201d",

The next day it was gone and the people who rented the other side of my duplex said they saw the neighbor hosing it down. Another time, she called the police on me because I didn\u2019t have my garbage can up at 7am, so within an hour of the garbage truck. Never mind that no one else did either, and that was the only time she ever had hers up at 7. Then, she saw my boyfriend come over one night (now husband) and told him I was cheating on him with a guy she saw come over the night before. The guy was a friend who he knew I was having over so I could help him study for a test. The woman was such a miserable cow. And she used to threaten me by saying \u201cYou know I\u2019m a cop right?\u201d",

My brother and his brother were in the street, as kids do, and this old lady runs out of her house absolutely screaming at my brother, the youngest. \n\nShe was convinced 1. He had \"trespassed\" on her driveway. He didn't. He did stop on the sidewalk, tho. 2. He threw a rock at her garage? He definitely didn't, I was watching him (because he was in the road). \n\nAnyway she just screamed at him and didn't stop even tho he was crying like this little girl. I was very nonconfrontational at the time but even I walked over and in kid words told her to fuck off and he didn't do anything. At this time this hags husband came home and brought her inside. No apology or anything, and he did glare at us, so it's not a \"maybe she had dementia\". She still lives there, and I still hate her.",

It goes like this; as you get older and become tired more easily and have more free time due to retirement or your children leaving home and becoming established you begin to lose the bigger picture. Things that you would have ignored or realised didn't matter in the grand scheme because you were busy suddenly become huge. You lose all perspective and the smallest things become your whole world. A little girl drawing on the tarmac outside your home is now a huge infraction and something that eats at you because you've got nothing else to do, nothing else to focus on.",
