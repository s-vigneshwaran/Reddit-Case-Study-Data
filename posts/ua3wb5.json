Many of them were relatively \"poor\" and/or rural/nomadic, living in desert environments or places with no piped in water (like the Romans). Many of their utensils and food \"holders\" (pots, bowls, urns, cups) were very porous, untreated wood or animal bladders. There also was extremely limited water for any kind of washing. This was hygiene 101 back then. Knives were used, wiped on a rag and set aside. Wooden \"bowls\" and \"cups\" were wiped or \"rinsed\" with sand and set aside. They were used until the bacteria growth was obvious or for a set amount of time/uses to discourage this. \n\nWhile much of the book was added to control the adherents, parts were \"common sense\" teachings in the interest of learning better habits. Most of the Romans had piped in water, metal cooking/serving pieces and \"servants\" (slaves?) to haul water or dishes to water if necessary, and to scrub them. From the whole Bible section, it reads like someone who had extensive knowledge of how the Romans or other so well supplied peoples lived and who sought similar ways for their people to NOT get ill from food borne bacteria. \n\nWe also need to remember that the \"present canon\" started out a huge collection of writings from hundreds of areas and peoples and that the councils Nicea cherry picked which ones to add to their compilation and which ones to leave out. When the choices were made, it was the complaints that caused them to label the discarded ones \"heretic\", \"apocryphal\" and \"Pseudepigrapha\". Since none of us were there, we can only read what they wrote (with HUGE boxes of salt) and speculate on exactly why they made the specific choices they did. But my thinking on this one is, that while it was probably written for the hygiene of the poor, rural nomads, their privileged \"POV\" lives had them considering it another control. The poor would have been quite hard pressed to gather and maintain several completely separate sets of dishes which probably appealed to the leaders. \n\nI actually know a family who keeps those OT cooking/eating rules. If it was gradual it might not have been so bad, but if it was an all of a sudden change, I can see how it might have been extremely pricey to create.",

I had to explain to him that way back when, you milked your cow in the morning so milk was fresh, but by evening it might not still be good (in the days before pasteurization and refrigeration) so to keep people from getting sick off spoiled dairy the religious leaders made it a holy law to not have dairy in the evening.\n\nAnd the same with burkas and hijabs. Great way to keep blowing desert sand out of places where you don't want sand. Also remember the nomadic desert tribes were in the habit of raiding other tribes for brides if they didn't have enough women in their own tribe for their sons to choose from, so keeping your woman covered up in black was a good way for her not to be kidnapped. That eventually turned into an edict that if a man isn't safe from lust at sight of a woman, she should be covered so only her eyes will show, that's why some women even wear gloves to cover their hands. And also why women aren't allowed to go anywhere without being accompanied by a male relative.",

I don\u2019t go to church but my local Greek church hosts tons of Greek events that I\u2019ll attend on occasion. I love the community aspect of it. As a kid I went to the \u201cold\u201d Saint George Greek Orthodox Church, which was an old church in a bad area of a nearby town. Through years and years of fundraising, we were able to build a beautiful church with a banquet hall and a youth center for sports. That\u2019s what church should be. Not just praising the lord, but building a community that supports people even if they don\u2019t necessarily believe in god. I went to high school with a lot of Greek peers that don\u2019t believe in god, but we still support our church and our culture.  \n  \nOn a side note, my cousin is a staunch atheist, as was his mother. We have an aunt in Georgia, and they went to church with her while on a visit. The priest gave some anti-gay bullshit and my cousin and aunt immediately stood up and left. I guess it just depends on where you live. Conservative states just preach and preach and preach, but here in my area of New Jersey we have a lot of churches that celebrate community above all.  \n  \nTLDR; community church good, praise the lord church  bad.",

Not just keep Bibles out of school and government - keep anything religiously motivated out of the government. This includes a lot of things, even little things like allowing Hobby Lobby to discriminate against gays. No other company is allowed, what\u2019s the difference? Hobby Lobby claims religious exceptions. Sorry. No more. We all know where this is gonna lead if permitted. Give an extremist an inch, they\u2019ll take your whole country.\n\nAnd guess what! Other religions get the *same* treatment. No special treatment or oppression. Equal separation from church and state. So get out of here with your both sides nonsense.",

I was devout for the first 15 years of my life.\n\nYou know why I became disillusioned? Exactly because of the practices of Hindus, not Hinduism itself. You admit it yourself - caste may be problematic now - but that's the crux of the issues. Is religion just text? No! The actual practice is just as, if not more, important.\n\nSo let's make the distinction between faith (and the text it's based on) and actual practice (what it's supposed adherents do).\n\nThe Quran says to kill or badly treat kafirs as part of Jihad. So what makes a good Muslim? The one that acts to kill non-believers or the one that chooses peace? I would say the latter.\n\nHindu texts don't have any such texts about the killing or maltreatment of non-believers or lower castes. What makes a good Hindu? The one that allows maltreatment or the one that stands against it and calls it out. Once again, I would say the latter.\n\nBut what's worse? Having a religious text that preaches maltreatment and acting on it OR not having a religious text and still treating people - many from your own culture and religion - badly? I'd say the latter, because you don't even have an excuse.\n\nLet's go back to your example about exams. You likened exams to Hinduism. Did I say let's scrap Hinduism? No. I implied the fact that the stakeholders (Hindus) - both students and teachers - have allowed the process to become corrupted. And a corrupt examination process means nothing. \n\nWhen it started, it had a purpose, but those responsible for maintaining the sanctity of the process have undermined that purpose. And therefore, it requires reformation.\n\nFYI you're on an Atheist subreddit. I don't know why you're stanning so hard for any particular religion, except for the fact that you and I were born into the same one.",

And quoting the Bible to fight Bible thumpers shuts them up faster than trying to fight them with logic, you don\u2019t have to believe in what the book says to call them out with their own book. Any group is going to have people looking to jump down people\u2019s throats over the smallest things (pretty much what you just did), but you can\u2019t judge a whole group by the outliers. Not every Christian is a horrible human being, and by standing on the moral high ground claiming every bit of it is bad your being just as authoritarian as those your spewing hate on. Understanding, respect, forgiveness, and humiliation are all taught in certain parts of the Bible, and if you take out the omniscient being aspect they do still hold up as true good moral lessons, and the world needs a lot of more those morals being spread than hate and animosity, regardless of how wrong you think others are.",

These ideas are also in conflict with most religions, as the nation state is irrelevant compared to the god they believe in. Wont stop religious fascism though. In Mexico, there is a catholic version of Corporatism (fascist economic system) called Distributism and they want to take back the land the Mexican Empire lost to the United States. I just watched a video on a US fascist party from 1985 to 2005, and oddly enough, they were really into Social Justice for minorities and \"christian values\". I think they were called the Falange which was also the Spanish fascist party's name if im not mistaken.",

If I was going to fight an American Fascism, which does exist, I would fight the government. Its the same idea as if you want to fix any issue you have to go to the roots.

When you want to find out how you should behave, how you should organize your community, how you should conduct business, organized religion is actually pretty good at that. Many of the things we use in modern, secular post-enlightenment technocratic republican-definitely-not-corporate-fascist strains of government are based on those little picked-and-chosen pockets of older systems that had flaws for whatever reason. And so it goes, where people try to construct a better world every single day.\n\nAlso, historical contexts have (in my experience speaking with scholars on this subject) made the texts a lot MORE logical, not less. Most of it is \"Oh, so that's why they were so mad about X\" or \"Oh, so that's what prompted this remark.\" It's a bit like reading the Constitution and then poring through the Federalist Papers and learning about the history of why our document says the shit it does. Try to take a \"logical\" stance absent historical context except \"founding fathers owned slaves\" and you'll end up with some really confusing and illogical conclusions about how government should be organized and operated.\n\nEDIT: and this is by no means saying there is a god or that you should follow any particular religion",

The deeper point would be, there are no principles in the Bible that would justify the perpetual oppression and injustice that was the American slavery system. You can only attempt to justify it by cherry-picking certain verses, which most of your examples supported.\n\nWhen applying actual biblical principles, it will lead one to naturally be opposed to slavery, which is why Christians spearheaded the abolitionist movements.",

Religion directly contradicts that, indoctrination. It's classified as an illegal cultist criterion for a reason.\n\n\n\n\n>You are entirely backwards. Moons converted the discussion from slavery to American slavery undercutting the value of the discussion. Did you not read the thread?  - youareallnuts\n\n\n\nEdit: Religion facilitated the mindset which justified slavery already previously in our country, look what's happening now - we are headed for hell in a hand basket - and I mean that in the most literal, non-religious way possible, if religion is not corraled and put away, taken out of law, and unwinded from the collective society as a whole. It is causing so much more damage than anything else.",

I say this as a devout (ironic) agnostic atheist. And just as most Muslims are against their extremists, most Christians were against the KKK.\n\nMy point is that slavery was just a thing that was always practiced, especially outside of Europe. They didn\u2019t have many slaves (aside from serfs, which was not nearly as bad as your 1800s plantation slavery) until they had the New World and a large labour demand. Before that though, it was just a matter of \u201cI\u2019m stronger than you and you\u2019re either my slave or you die\u201d.  The Romans had millions of slaves and didn\u2019t justify it with religion, they justified it with power.\n\nIslam justified slavery as well. They justified it as a natural part of society, and the only exception to those enslaved were that slaves couldn\u2019t be members of a Muslim society, whether Muslim or Dhimmi (non-Muslim). (if you wanna read more here you go: https://web.archive.org/web/20170223125519/http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/214 - I will say that generally slaves of Muslims had it better than slaves of Christians, but I would say that\u2019s more a consequence of capitalistic greed than religion). Slavery is bad and religion is bad for having justified it in the past. I\u2019ll call both Christianity and Islam \u201creligions of peace\u201d sarcastically in this conversation. In real life, however, I do believe truly evil Christians or Muslims are few and far between nowadays.",

And, if God is really perfect and immutable, it means God never agreed with how his messages were interpreted by the people who wrote the old testaments books. He tried everything to get his point across but it never resolved the problem, so he decided to come in flesh and bones to stop with the hebrew bullshit.\n\nAt least, with this point of view, this whole shebang makes more sense.",

Most of them dictate that you should do things in a very specific way in order to appease God/Allah/whoever, but then if you fuck up, it's still cool, just apologize and move on. They preach a very narrow view of morality, wherein their own religious texts contradict themselves in many places, and is open to a lot of interpretation.  Even those who consider themselves devout followers tend to pick and choose what they want to believe and follow, ignoring some things out of convenience and lambasting those that ignore the ones they consider sacrosanct.  But, generally, you can go on being an asshole for most of your life, repent at the end, and still get eternal salvation.   It's why atheists (in my experience) tend to be of higher moral character. Their beliefs are straightforward. This life is the only one we have, and we better make it a good one because we're not getting reincarnated, we're not hanging in Heaven or Valhalla afterwards.",

Well for a start, I dont hate theists, I hate organised religion - its the source of some incredible evil in the world. But how does it differ for me is your question - well, I don't proselytize, I dont seek out people who believe things different from me and try to convert them, particularly with threats of eternal violence. Nor do I tell people that the way they choose to love someone is abhorant or makes them a degenerate, If nobody is getting hurt I have no reason to judge how someone chooses to love another. \n3. Your whole argument seems to centre on the idea that if I think myself better than theists (I dont, but lets go with it), and judge them (I don't, I judge the religion itself), then I am no better. Well thats just a silly argument because from that point of view, nobody can ever judge anyone as ever doing any wrong because in doing so you are suddenly commiting an equal or greater crime. Its ludicrus. The crimes that religion has acted out on this earth are far greater and far more numerous than simply judging people. Religion causes death, misery, pain, suffering and so on. \n\nAs a relgiouos person, one cannot simply cant go around telling people that condoms are evil, that being gay is a sin, that children who were raped and bore a child as a result of incesteous child rape should carry that pregnancy to term or else they are unspeakably evil, without someone who doesn't believe in any of that judging you for your wicked beliefs, and detestable behaviour if/when declaring such things to others.",

As you know, cancerous people take on all forms. Religion is no more a source of evil than atheism or anything else we're free to believe. There's evil people in every single demographic, discreetly using each one as a disguise and an outlet for immoral behavior. Religion isn't some hive mind that mass-produces hostile nut-jobs. Religion itself isn't a monolith. There are differing ideologies being taught from church to church. You have different church buildings that teach varying things and have varying social groups. Some churches are run by corrupt pastors who manipulate and scam people, some churches are run by hateful people that want to persecute others, and some are run by decent people with no ulterior motive besides altruism that just want to show others plainly what the Bible says, which is to pursue peace and love God and love your neighbor as you love yourself.\n\nTL;DR: It's not the religion that's inherently bad, it's some of the people that \"practice\" it.",

Good people doing evil didn't exist *at all* before 4000 years ago when the first religion was recorded to be founded? Were good people perfectly never doing evil back then or they just didn't exist? How would Steven Weinberg even know that? There's a lack of possibility to even collect data to substantiate a claim like that. You quote it like it's an authority on the matter when it reads more like a late-night tweet rather than a fact or even a statement that has a hope of being accurate. Also wouldn't being a good person doing evil (which implies said evil-doing is occasional) practically be a step-up in every way from an evil person who does evil.. habitually doing evil? A good person who does evil would typically be more useful to society than a flat-out evil person.",

If your manager, your neighbor, your friend is religion then whatever failure in their reasoning that allowed to accept and keep accepting something ridiculous on faith may be applied to something else non-religious that affects you. Thsoe people vote, spend money in your community, exist on the street with you. They may not affect you, but they affect policies that affect you, spend money on people who affect you, and they logically reason in a world where your safety and wellbeing are affected by them just by existing. And that logical reasoning has been shownto be faulty. \n\nSo yea you think, as long as they do it on the weekend and dont bother me with it, and you let it go on. But no one prays in a closet and then goes out into the real world without letting those irrational deluded ideas get to them. \n\nIm not even talking about the obvious ones that are homophobic or use religion to ban abortion or take away rights from people. The quiet ones who seem nice are also problematic because they have shown a failure in logic and reasoning by accepting foolish stories with no evidence, they have shown they are more gullable, and can be taken advantage of. That opens them up for nonreligious scams, mlm type stuff, qanon type conspiracies on yhe crazier side of it. And by saying you are ok with it as long it doesn't obviously bother you, you allow it to fester until its too late. \n\nAnd the middle \"less crazy\" ones are also used by the radical ones to get their ideas more accepted and mainstream. A radical christian might say \"we are both good christians, please support me\" and then they get their soapboxes and get voted in or whatever and the moderates vote for them wothout noticing, or give them the benefit of the doubt. \n\nThey are an infection, and we let that train of thought go by when it was just a small cough and a few mild symptoms. Aches here or there \"that didnt bother me much\" and they festered and became a cancer. There is no such thing as a religion that doesnt affect you, not when half the country is using it to justify killing gays, stripping rights from trans people, subjugating women, and wishing death on nonbelievers.\n\nThis isnly a silly bottle cap collecting hobby you do for fun and keep in your spare room that has no bearing on the way you act in public. Because that truly is fine and doesn't bother anyone else. This is a dangerious set of ideas that half my country and most of the world has radicalized and used to justify some horrendous actions and ideas.",

And im saying that logical failures that allow you to hold any religious beliefs open you up to other logical fallacies that cant hurt others when you exist in society. But yea, thats the same thing and Im \"no better than\" them for pointing it out. \n\nYes, not all religious people are openly homophobic bigots who want to kill all atheists, subjugate women, and lobotomize all trans people or anyone who doesn't strictly adhere to their preconceived gender notions. Many that I have met, most I would even say, are kind hearted and strugle with the cognitive dissonance they are forced into from their indoctrination and hurt when they have to reconcile what they believe and what they feel when we speak about this stuff. They are good people in spite of their religion. \n\nBut...\n\nThey open themselves up to further problematic logical thinking when they accept absolutely any religious claim on faith. And since we exist all together, in a society and all, you cant decouple your beliefs from the way you act and the decisions you make. And so those ideas need to be questioned, debated, and even ridiculed when they are more extreme. You need to argue and cant allow them to exist because they tend to get worse when left unchecked. \n\nAll I am saying is all our decisions all affect each other even if you don't think so. There is no truly neutral stance when we are all intertwined with each other as humans.",

Wherever they see cooperation and prosperity, they invade and conquer, strip mine anything of value and dehumanize the inhabitants to justify their evil. Think India, Africa and the original Americas. They make them \"protectorates\" and anyone who mistakenly believes that means they protect the country and the people, you need to read some more history. They were/are protecting THEIR right to steal from the original inhabitants. You want a more recent example? The Tulsa massacre. Free black people were told \"we don't want your kind living among us\", so they said \"ok\" and set about creating their own section of town. They had businesses, banks, schools, movie theaters and large homes. They were unequivocally PROOF that left alone we ARE real humans with the same capabilities. The neighboring white city said \"oh HELL no, they can't be ALLOWED to have anything as nice or nicer than ours!!\" And they swept in and destroyed everything, murdering hundreds. To make that worse, they tried to write it out of history while writing laws (redlining, stereotyping) that make sure that any area that has a large number of minorities is deemed NOT fit to receive funding, or infrastructure repair/improvement or anything that would allow it to thrive. \n\nWe'd have to build a wall around it to keep them out and defend it, just like they keep trying to do on racial and ethnic lines. If they SAW an area ... a town, city, a country ... that was filled with smart, prosperous minorities, LGBTQ people, women and unbiased children ... They would LOSE THEIR MINDS trying to destroy it. Me? I would want to join and be a contributing member of a happy throng like that. But seeing \"others\" prosper threatens their desire to believe and feel they are better than everyone else. Kicker is, that they KNOW they aren't. And THAT is why it bothers them so much. \n\nTHAT is why we can't have anything that is just ours. we find it acceptable, but they never will. Sad, but true. Until one group ... \"us\" or \"them\" is destroyed... there will be no peace. If \"we\" win, there is hope.  If \"they\" win, human kind is doomed because once they've obliterated all minorities, LGBTQ people, and \"uppity\" women ... they will search for those left among them to torture. Remember, the Jewish \"problem\"?? And how at one time the Irish, Italians, Serbians etc were NOT considered also white? They will NEVER be happy. And the scary thing is that it feels like we will have to lower ourselves to their \"destroy or be destroyed \" level to survive.",

I'm one of the few people I know who thinks tearing down the racist statues etc is a bad thing NOT because the statues are good.

Kind of like Germany is trying to do with the Holocaust \"some of our ancestors did this evil thing, let's not do anything like that again\". \n\nAnd most organized religions at some point in history have done or are now doing the same things.

I'd argue it's not, and rather is a self-fulfilling prophecy of failure and loss, especially when their tied to the rest of us. Change is necessary for a better world, finding solace in the eternity of god is the antithesis of systemic change. \n\nChurch preaches acceptance of the status quo, perhaps not personally, but definitely systemically. \n\nEveryone needs an escape, but church shouldn't be one of them.",

Studies show that when children are exposed to ideas like this early, they are less likely to be bigoted against a large range of political and sexual minorities, including women.\n\n2: comprehensive sexual education is found to be correlated with reductions in unplanned pregnancy, child poverty, spread of venereal disease, and abortions. Colorado has seen a massive reduction in welfare spending because of their program distributing intrauterine devices to teenagers without parental consent. Not to mention, there was a marked reduction in teen unplanned pregnancy, which is a massive boon to those teen\u2019s education, and their physical, mental, and financial well being.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, I don\u2019t think you care about those things. I can\u2019t speak to what\u2019s in your head, but removing gender, sex, and sexuality from our school curricula does nothing but harm students.",

Let everyone else decide for themselves if they want to be religious, REGARDLESS OF RELIGION. If you practice it, go to churches, mosques, shrines, masses, etc.,  good for you. But do not FORCE it unto others. For crying out loud, even the Bible says, and I'm paraphrasing here, that even non-believers have a place in Heaven, should be treated with respect and if someone does not want to believe, it's their business, and SPECIFICALLY the Christian God will love them as equals regardless, and religion should not be forced unto them, it's only a choice. Funny how some people spend decades reading and studying their holy book of choice, yet, fail to realise its most basic teachings.",

A movie \"inspired by true events\" takes certain liberties for various reasons, often the details don't come through or things get lost in translation. God communicates through feelings and ideas, not words, so translating that often leads to errors and miscommunication, but the basic ideas are there. Taking the symbols, or the words, at face value is losing sight of the true message they were trying to translate. It's happened in many cultures all over the world.\n\nFrom the beginning, each book chosen to be a part of the Bible has been to create a certain narrative, trying to interpret God's words through the writings of people who felt the inspiring presence of what they interpreted to be their patron God. They're just well preserved documents of wisdom, not a continuous narrative of a single story. Jesus only used the Old Testament to try to communicate to the people of his time because that's what they were familiar with, but what he was trying to more or less do away with it, replace the Mosaic code with the New Covenant. The people of his time didn't really get the message and instead of realizing his true message, they pedestalized him and made him special, so the status quo basically continued.",

In the past, we naturally were more violent, extreme, and simple, and the God in that part of the Bible reflects that. Jesus represented an evolved consciousness and so introduced a God that reflects that. He was an enlightened being not unlike Buddha or Krishna, and his Gospel is that we're all children of God, not just him as modern Christianity would put you down to make you believe.",

God didn't speak English, and this language we use falls so short of expressing what He truly is. If all you have is the Bible, it's like thinking the smell of food is all there is to eat.",

It wasn\u2019t uncommon for unscrupulous merchants to take bones and other effects and tell churches that they are the bones of some saint, or pieces of the cross. There\u2019s a long standing joke that there\u2019s enough pieces of the cross in Europe to build a ship. Of course, that doesn\u2019t preclude the existence of Jesus as a person or deity, but evidence is limited. Even religious institutions generally acknowledge that the New Testament was written approximately 60+ years after the death of Jesus and only one may have been written by someone with original sources. Also a fun fact to note, and entirely undeniable, is that the modern English version of the Bible is a translation of a translation, copies of copies that definitely say slightly different things than what was originally written. I might suggest that you not base every action on the document, unless of course you\u2019re reading the original text in its original language, 1900+ years ago with the full cultural context of the time.",

It seems to me that a lot of people read the thing and then go on and commit terrible acts in the name of their God as defined in that book. What if the one who wrote/dictated their book however, did it with the utmost malice in mind. Perchance their end goal was all the death and misery that has come about due to its existence. I posit that the one who really was behind the creation of their bible was Satan and he did it so that he could manipulate the unintelligent rubes.\n\nHowever, this is all based on the assumption that their mythology is real, but since it's not, this was nothing more than a waste of time and thought.\n\nI'll see myself out.",

There are many different bibles, based on who was ruling at the time. The King James version is most quoted in the Southern US.  This is the version where women are judged to be guilty of the first sin by disobeying god and picking the wrong piece of fruit and tempting her man to have a bite too. It became the first time women fed men snd went to canon (jk).  Prostitution, women turning to look at a city, tempting Sampson and ruining his hair.\n\nKing James version is heavy on obedience and punishment and god being a dick.  King James also took a lot of previous books out, mostly about Jesus years between six and thirty.\nThat\u2019s not even addressing Hebrew, Muslim, Catholic, Mormon and more sects and their books.",

I remember reading Grimm tales as a child and young teen, as well as Bible, Greek, Roman, Norse myths, fairytales without much censorship, like the Red Riding Hood with cannibalism, folk songs where people got killed, dismembered, and tortured.\nI wasn't very stable mentally, but it wasn't due to books I read. It was pretty fascinating, I love folklore even now. So basically if we separate bible from religion, considering it as a book of mythology, which it is, it's pretty fine. Like no one would say that incest in Greek mythology is something ok, so bible should be considered through the same lenses.",

Disney supports their economy so much. And not only did the fl government turn on Disney, it got its people to turn as well. This will not end well for FL or it\u2019s people.

I do not have hope for idiots not being idiots, you\u2019re correct. Because I\u2019ve grown up in this country and I know that we give too much freedoms and liberties to people who will continue to spread their hate and lies. Will it ever change? I certainly hope so, so I think that\u2019s going to happen in the next decade or two? Not even a chance. Not as long as FL continues making \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d laws, allowing guns to be rampant, encouraging stand your ground laws, encouraging hate and vitriol. It\u2019s going to take a while to undo all that FL has done. \n\nI do not \u201clive with that negative outlook\u201d because I made it up in my head. I\u2019m going off of what people have shown me. Because I believe that when people show you who they are, you should believe them. Also, you\u2019ve been in FL for what? A few years? I\u2019ve lived with this hateful ass country my entire life. I\u2019ve watch FL intelligent population steadily decline since the 80\u2019s. It\u2019s going to take A LOT. And I just don\u2019t believe it\u2019s going to happen for a long while. But you continue that hope. I hope FL is kind to you and your family. I just know it would be anything but for mine.\n\nEdit: I misread and thought you said you were from England. Not New England. Either way, FL is a shit state. It has potential but won\u2019t reach it as long as it continues to harbor all that hate like it does. I\u2019m sure if you\u2019re a straight, white male, you\u2019ll do great there though. It\u2019s just the place for that. I just know my children couldn\u2019t live their true lives in FL and that\u2019s a sad and disgusting thing to realize, that even in the US in 2022, there are states where my child can\u2019t even say they themselves are gay and have a discussion about it in school. Idk why anyone volunteers to live somewhere like that. Ripe with growth or not. Fuck that.",

Since there\u2019s so many translations of the Bible not only Christian\u2019s, but atheist quote them out of their context to their own gains. \n\nThis particular verse for example, the famed Jewish Rabbi Rashi points out that what we translate as \u201clittle boys\u201d had more than just that meaning.\u00a0 It was also a word that would be used to refer to those without\u00a0mitzvot\u00a0(without moral conscience) and thus could refer to any immoral person.\n\nBefore the incident where Elisha is mocked by the young men, he had performed a miracle purifying the water in\u00a0Jericho.\u00a0A strand of Jewish tradition has claimed that these young men from\u00a0Beth-el had been making a business out of bringing good water into Jericho and by purifying the water there the prophet had destroyed their business.\u00a0Their \u201cwater cartel\u201d could no longer take advantage of the situation, so they descended upon Elisha.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo if we reset our thinking on the passage, what we see is essentially a gang of criminals descend upon a holy man taunting him and attempting to intimidate him.\u00a0They tell him to \u201cgo away\u201d or \u201cgo up.\u201d\u00a0This is the same word that is used to describe Elijah being taken up to heaven. By telling Elisha to \u201cgo away\u201d or \u201cgo up,\u201d the wording is not simply telling him to leave their presence but to leave this world!\u00a0 \n\nIf more than forty members of a youth gang surrounded you and told you they thought you should not be in this world, I think you\u2019d take that as a definite threat to your safety and life.\n\nThey were cursed for their hatred of God and their greed and disregard for their fellow countrymen.\u00a0Judaism considers taking advantage of another\u2019s unfortunate situation (such as charging exorbitant prices for water to people desperate for water) to be a grave sin.\u00a0As such, this would have been viewed as a just punishment for these price gougers who held hatred for what is good and holy.",

Those who have believing masters should not show them disrespect just because they are fellow believers. Instead, they should serve them even better because their masters are dear to them as fellow believers and are devoted to the welfare of their slaves.\n\n>Timothy 6:1-2\n\n>Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything; and do it, not only when their eye is on you and to curry their favor, but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the Lord.\n\n>Colossians 3:22\n\n>Teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything, to try to please them, not to talk back to them, and not to steal from them, but to show that they can be fully trusted, so that in every way they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive\n\n>Titus 2:9-10\n\n> And that slave, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.

Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.\n\n>-Matthew 5:17-19",

In Protestant evangelical circles, anti abortion arose in the late 20th century.  It\u2019s a very new movement. This is the only passage in the entire Bible that outlines a punishment for a destroyed fetus. (Exodus 21:22-24)\n\n> When people who are fighting injure a pregnant woman so that there is a miscarriage, and yet no further harm follows, the one responsible shall be fined what the woman\u2019s husband demands, paying as much as the judges determine. If any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\n\nDestroying a fetus against spousal couple's will is a fine.  Killing the woman is an eye for an eye.  The passage makes no sense if one assumes destroying a fetus is murder.",

So 3 out of 10.  \n\nThe rest, don't be jealous of your neighbors stuff and while you're at it don't screw their spouse either, don't backtalk your parents, don't work on Sunday, don't take Lords name in vain, etc..none of that is illegal.. So why does it need to be in a court room again?\n\nAnd for that matter, if those are supposed to be THE most important rules in life, the most important to God....funny it doesn't include to not be gay since that is such a high priority to be obsessed about with Christians.  And sad that there is no mention about things like don't rape and don't be a pedophile, don't abuse children,  don't commit incest!  (things that actually are illegal now and would be handy to have on that list on a courtroom wall) Because clearly God thought telling people to not work on Sundays or say his name in vain and hurt his feelings took much higher precedence than commanding people to not be a pedophile.   \n\nMakes sense.  Swell guy, that God.",

The 1769 version is the one most people refer to.\n\nThe English Standard Version was translated in 2001 originally and most recently in 2016.\n\nA common misconception is that the KJV is the direct translation and all the other versions are paraphrased versions. The ESV is also a translation from the originals (well not actual originals since those do not exist, but copies in the original languages.) If anything, the ESV is more accurate to the original Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew texts.\n\nThe issue is that no English translation is word for word, because if it was, it wouldn't make any sense. Because of syntax, but also because of idioms and culture, some things must be interpreted to make sense in English. If I told a person in Mandarin that something \"smells fishy,\" they would take it literally, when you meant that something is suspicious. Thus, interpretation is required.\n\nSo basically, the KJV was translated to make sense to the people living in the 15th and 16th centuries, whereas the ESV was translated to make sense to people in the 21st century. Both were translated with the aim to be as close to the original as possible.",

It's more accurately translated as \"Thou shalt not kill without a good excuse.\" Later commandments specify that an example of a valid excuse is anyone who doesn't worship God.\n\nThere's also the word \"slave\" which has about 1050 possible uses, all of which are translated otherwise, despite some pretty damning context clues around several of them. It also has about 150 definite uses of the word which the KJV translates only 1 as \"slave\" and it's metaphorical.",

And since evolution has been basically solidified as a well known scientific fact at this point (as well as origin of life research being at an all time peak in interest (basically every biochemist at this point accepts abiogenesis)), that change would be extremely gradual.

Cults have real consequences for leaving that are administered by the cult leadership. Any Catholic for example can stop being Catholic without fear of reprisal from the Vatican.

You aren't dealing with sane people here. Regardless of the actual effects of forcing Bible reading in schools, they will always support it and always feel better about it because it makes them perceive the schools as being more godly.\n\nIt's basically loose-loose for atheists. If we ban bibles, they will perceive schools as being influenced by Satan. They'll start home schooling and christian parts of the country will drop even further in education levels.

I literally don't believe anything. You might not even exist. I might be in a vat, dreaming everything I'm experiencing. You get the idea.\n\nI don't think it's possible to fully remove personal beliefs from political life, honestly, because we all have them without realizing it. But I do think it's the ideal situation. I also don't see how anyone could actually enforce it without becoming worse than the thing they were trying to eliminate. The closest we can get is probably just good education, and hope that religion would eventually fade away, like a sickness finally overcome.\n\nI mostly like to take my earlier stance to troll religious people in general.",

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHRmdCZO2bE) he argues that:\n\n1. God didn't order a genocide and mass murder of the Caanites, since they could've run away from their own homes when God ordered the Israelites to invade and kill everyone living there.\n\n2. These people didn't respect God and live like he wanted, so it was right to kill them.\n\n3. Morality is defined as doing what God wants. So when God tells you to kill people, killing people is a good deed.\n\n4. God has the right to kill anyone for any reason (because people die all the time).\n\n5. Even when God tells you to murder innocent children you are doing a good deed! \n\n6. Actually, the Caanite children getting their heads bashed in or a spear through their guts by Israelite soldiers were, and I'm quoting here, **\"the recipient of an infinite good\"** - because if you die when you're still a child and innocent, you go to heaven! \n\nNo, I'm not making this shit up, or exaggerating the slightest - one of the biggest Christian (and richest) apologists in the US is on record saying that the children getting brutally murdered by invading Israelites were \"the recipient of an infinite good\"... \n\nAnother \"favorite\" when it comes to apologetics, that is far less depressing than the psycho William Lane Craig, and instead just absolutely hilarious, is the people who claim that the Bible verse [demanding a woman's hand be cut of if she by accident grab the junk of another man while that man and her husband is fighting](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy%2025%3A11-12&version=NIV) is a mistranslation. (Yes, the bible is strangely specific at times...)\n\nWhat the verse *actually* say, they claim, is that a woman who grabs another man's junk by mistake has to get a.... public brazilian waxing! Somehow, people like Paul Copan argues that the verse actually should read \"shave her groin\" instead of \"cut of her hand\" ...",

Each unit was on a region, and we discussed their history, culture, traditions, etc. When we studied the Middle East, we learned about Islam. When we studied Asia, we learned about Buddhism, Taoism, etc. And I\u2019m glad we learned about all those religions. It was a pretty mind opening experience for me as an edgy 14 year old atheist who only really knew about Christianity. Religion is an integral part of history, and learning about various religions is essential for a proper understanding. The issue is when the Bible or other religious texts are used when they are not contextually relevant, or when they are presented in a lopsided manner (ie: *this one* is legit, these others are crazy stuff, or only talking about one of them).\n\nI\u2019m just thankful that my teacher (RIP) was a good one. He was truly honest and unbiased in his presentation of various cultures. He never suggested that any of the religions were lesser, inferior, etc. I know a lot of people in America don\u2019t get lucky enough to have teachers like that.",

Just food for thought here so make of it what you will: Satan in Hebrew means \u201cResister.\u201d In this case it\u2019s a title for the spirit creature who opposes God. I really like your description of him as a prosecutor. The last book of the Bible also calls him an \u201caccuser\u201d of Biblically-righteous people, as well as \u201cthe original serpent,\u201d referring to the snake in Eden who tempted Eve. I say this because by the time Satan prosecuted God and Job, he had already been established as the Resister because of his misleading Adam and Eve, and the point of his prosecution was to prove that Job was only faithful because of all the blessings he received from God, and that if those blessings were exchanged for suffering, he would curse God. Then he insinuated that this was human nature, that all believers would compromise their beliefs when met with suffering. God allowed the prosecution to make its case, which ultimately vindicated Job as a faithful man.\n\nI don\u2019t wanna get long-winded or come across as preachy so I\u2019ll leave it at that for now.",

When Job complains god pridefully boasts about all they had done (making earth, leviathan, etc etc) and then tells Job that they give out arbitrary justice, doesn't have to explain their reasoning to Job, and that Job wouldn't even be able to understand because god is so far beyond Job's comprehension. Job says sorry, god gives him stuff back. First, why is god unable to give Job the ability to comprehend? Second, god is saying that humanity is wholly insignificant to themselves which goes with the third. God kills Job's children and servants because god views humans as so insignificant that god can just play with their lives, ruin, or end them on a whim. But god doesn't have to explain themselves because we can't understand it and apparently god is either unable or unwilling to. Why would I worship a god like this? I'm less than an ant to them. And yes that is the dogma that I used to think was okay. \"God is so great and we are nothing in comparison.\" I won't accept a god that says I'm not worthy to know why they do what they do, I just have to trust them.",

There is a difference between allowing and causing something to happen. I know that might sound like a trivial distinction, but it does have weight in the context of this event. Job mistakenly believed God was causing his suffering (why wouldn\u2019t he, right?), and became self righteous midway through the trial. The comparison of his insignificance to the creator\u2019s greatness was to humble him. Yes, there are things about God that are unfathomable, but his purpose can be understood from the overarching theme of the Bible. If someone claims to be a Christian and to adhere to the Bible, that should be basic knowledge, but the vast majority of Christians PREFER (I don\u2019t know how to do italics) the mystery and blind faith and the cherry-picking of bible verses.

And god said to put Job through the ringer. And a lot of other people died and as far as the book goes they weren't resurrected.

If the all-knowing adults are all Christian, then some kids will join, and I don't think that's a good message to give to teens.\n\nSince I didn't bring up the Bible in this comment, here's something to hold you over: biblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebiblebible",

Sure they have to play pretend to some degree, but there are plenty of ways to bend and blur boundaries.\n\nAlso no, that's really not a law in that sense. The phrase comes from the establishment clause of the first amendment - which is specific to Congress. The interpretation and use of the clause is complicated. It's not just some black and white law used to punish people.\n\nEssentially I'm saying the world is messy and religion has extremely strong influence in the US, from our politics to our laws to our public schools. There's plenty of pushback against it in more secular and diverse urban centers, but leave those areas and things become muddy real fast.",

Both fundamentalist Christians and Mormons have their hands in everything and constantly fuck with the states education systems, influencing it where they can and defunding it when they can't with the ultimate goal of having every child in a religious private school.\n\nI lived most of my life in what would be termed poverty and got to experience it first hand. But sure dude, I'm classist for being mad about my lack of access to good or secular education as a child and how that has only added to the massive class divide by denying our children access to tools that would set them up to compete better with more urban educated children and long term help the communities and state prosper socially and financially instead of continuing cycles of indoctrination, socially regressive policies, and lack of financial freedom.\n\nI'm terribly sorry to advocate for children's rights and resources and call out systemic educational oppression and manipulation when I witness it.\n\nI guess that makes me a classist bigot huh? I mean I am one of those dumb rural people so what do I know? I'll also be sure to inform my family who has fought for better education from the inside that their actuality being classist and bigoted. Which means their not poor anymore I suppose!

Instances of cannibalism are recorded during these periods but it is unknown if this happened during the pharaonic era of Ancient Egypt.[19] Beatrix Midant-Reynes describes human sacrifice as having occurred at Abydos in the early dynastic period (c. 3150\u20132850 BCE),[20] while Jan Assmann asserts there is no clear evidence of human sacrifice ever happening in Ancient Egypt.[21]\n\nMaybe it DOES always come back to the CHILDREN. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide",

My opinion is books shouldn\u2019t be banned; instead, the schools and parents should invest more time in helping understand the material the children read (and by helping understand I do not mean force or manipulate their own viewpoints on the young but instead see it from their point and help clear up any gray areas.",

We have Muslims, jews, Christians, Buddhists, etc all potentially going to public school. It's common sense imho. There are fundamental reasons for the establishment clause and all of the ammendments. The separation of church and state: we are a country of many religions and it's not the governments job to suppress or exclude any of them. Freedom of speech: protects from the suppression of ideas, opinions, and knowledge(so no book banning). Or this is how it should be. It is the law.",

One of the biggest factors in my deconversion was looking at the laws and seeing stuff like how the Bible actually commands that a woman be executed alongside her rapist if she's raped in the city and doesn't scream for help. Or the rule that says you can beat a slave as severely as you like, just as long as you don't kill them. Or the times God not only tolerated genocide, but outright commanded it, complete with the capture and subsequent rape of the unmarried young girls from the enemy tribe. Or the ordeal of bitter waters, which is a magic ritual to abort a pregnancy and (depending on the translation) sterilize a woman to prove she's cheating.\n\nThere is no possible way to reconcile what the Bible commands when you actually read it with any sort of modern notion of morality, which means that either we're wrong and rape, genocide, and slavery are good or God is wrong. Which completely destroys Abrahamic religions' reasoning for why we should worship him in the first place.",

Granted, the catholic church have a big problem with this and the recent scandal is pretty fucked up, but pedos will aways try to gather in places where they can have power over children. The church is just one of those places. Indoctrination is a problem too, but then again, it doesn't happen only in christianity.

Being agnostic is realizing that you will never know.

A religious person is more likely to have doubt than an atheist, therefore a religious person would be a better guide of religion vs atheism than an atheist would. Although an agnostic would be far better.",

As far as i know, most of the spiritual or religious people look for evidence that support their beliefs and undermine anything that opposes it. Which is absurd, why would you need evidence to support your faith. That just feels like compensating for something.\n\nSo, I believe foresay a montheist like Catholic could have a hard time learning about and explaining a polytheistic religion like Hinduism or vice versa.

This isn't the 1800 where information was kept locked away in the dungeons of christian worship houses. \n\nI honestly have no preclusion to religion. If you want to worship your sky god that's fine as long as it's peaceful and lawful, and you keep it our of my politics. There is no place for religion in politics.\n\nYou want to worship sticks in your back yard? I'll defend your right to do so. But keep your religion out of my politics or it is going to get really bad. Because there will come a day in America, possibly in the short time I have left, that christianity will be reviled by the masses. Christians will scream persecution but it will fall on deaf ears. It will be of their own doing.",

Everyone thinks it can\u2019t happen or that you can\u2019t beat an ideology by stopping to their level. That is absolutely not true. \n\nThe only way the conservative christofascist political right wing within the United States will be stopped is by physically fighting them in the streets. By eliminating more of them than they do of us, because make no mistake they have every intention of creating a national theocracy in this country. They have a plan and have been slowly enacting it piece by piece for roughly 40 years. They\u2019re not going to stop unless forced to.",

But that doesn't mean they can't teach about religions. We learned about Islam, Christianity, Zoroastrianism and all that in school. Social Studies class. It would be difficult not to teach it's such a huge part of society. So as long as there are other holy books, I guess it would've been okay to have a Bible in the library. \n\nUntil, of course, they decided to ban books for being violent or gay or whatever. Does that mean kids have to stop learning about war? What about Moby Dick? Killing those poor whales. What about Shakespeare? Julius Cesar being stabbed all those times? All that suicide at the end of Romeo and Juliet? What can you learn about? There's violence in literature and history. That's just the fact of how it is. How can they teach like this? They should be ashamed for using school kids as pawns for their political schemes.",

You just work backwards from whatever your tribe's authority figures said last. \n\nAnd I say \"you\" because they think we're the same way.\n\nThis is an internally consistent mindset. It's subjective truth - reality as a team sport. And from the outside, moment-to-moment, it looks aggravatingly close to rational argument. That's why we keep falling into the trap of asking \"but what do they *really* believe?\" as if some hidden perspective will \"make it make sense.\" Even as we *constantly* ask, \"how can they say that?\" and \"but that contradicts their other thing!\" - we seem determined not to wonder if they just don't care. \n\nMeanwhile, they think we just suck at making up reasons. We keep changing who we're loyal to, just because they said something different. And this - copying their logic? This is what they think hypocrisy is. \"WTF I love censorship now!\" They're *never* gonna drop everything when their excuses fall flat, because the excuses aren't why they're doing this. They just *say* \"here's why\" because that's the pattern for getting what you want. That's all they think we're doing, when we use words like \"because.\"\n\nContradiction is impossible, in this worldview. There is no objective means to evaluate claims. In their minds, that is not what claims are for. You either accept them or reject them as a display of interpersonal loyalty. A person can't just *be wrong.* They have to be undeserving of their place in a tribal hierarchy. Saying they're wrong means saying you're better - or that your science guy can beat up their science guy. It is less than ideology. It is far deeper and simpler and worse. \n\nNothing they do makes sense until you understand this.",

Then points to promotion of positive ethics as a violation of community standards within the book.\n\n> I seek the banishment of any book that *references* the Bible.\n\nEvery *reference*? This isn't even remotely supported by any state statutes.\n\nWhile it's great to applaud his intent - but his actions are shooting everyone in the foot. Once a review committee finds a book to be valid, it is *immune to future considerations for removal*. His half-assed approach to removing the Bible results in guaranteed protections for the Bible moving forward, once this specific infantile petition is rejected.",

I've met a lot of crazy Christians out there who would teach children the wrong thing, hell, I've spent years unlearning some of those wrong things. There are valid methods of using religious texts in the classroom, not for religious teaching but for examples of say poetry from before the rise of Rome and its foolish to think religious texts have no validity in discussing history and even historical biases and survival of propoganda. But using religious texts of any religion to dictate morals and ethics in a public school setting is morally and ethically wrong. Freedom of religion protected under the first Amendment is there to allow anyone the right to freely associate or not with religious belief systems, and forcing any belief system undermines choice and consent within those belief systems. You can't make \"True Christians\" by only allowing Christianity just as cant force people to be \"True Muslims\" or even \"True Athiests\" or \"True Pastafarians\" (apologies if I got the al-dentifier wrong) or \"True Jedi\" or \"True Satanists\". If I had kids, I wouldn't want them attending school in a \"Sharian Law\" school, much less a school dictated by the regressives who form the mainstream loud mouth bigotry that has become a mockery of Christianity. The best Christian teacher of the modern age was Mr. Rogers, and he never needed to mention Christ for people to see what Christianity should be about: empowering and championing the weak and downtrodden.\n\nApologies for invading a sub, i felt I should mention my position and support for universal human rights. There's a lot of crappy immature Christians out there, and even some crappy people who don't realize they're not actually Christians. It's not my responsibility to judge them, but I do need to strive to do better to rebuke them.",

Even in the book your talking about, the Mahabharat, a renowned warrior, Karun, is forced to cut off his thumb (so he can no longer be an archer) because he was of the wrong caste and taught himself how to be an archer. \n\nKrishan also tells everyone in his big boy ranty rant, that through him even \"Beasts, demons, women and low castes can be liberated\" aka women and low caste are on par with beasts and demons. \n\nLets not even get into the earlier texts which are even more messed. Raam makes his wife walk through fire to prove she is still pure after being kidnapped. Brahma raping his daughter Saraswati. The Upanishad saying if a woman denies a man sex post menstruation he should beat her and chant \"with my honor I take away your honor\"..\n\nI've studied alot of religions, but Hinduism takes the cake.",

It's very much not targeting Christianity, it's targeting any religion that tries to put itself in the public school system. \n\nChristians just think they deserve some kind of special treatment for some reason.\n\nE: someone deleted their comment but I went to the effort of typing a reply soooo...\n\nIt's not about consequences, I literally said nothing of the sort. Publicly funded institutions are not the place for religion. Whether it's Christianity; Islam; Sikhism, IDGAF, you don't have a right to put your religion into that setting. That's my stance. \n\nIf you want religious scripts in a school, start one yourself; no religion has the right to use public resources to indoctrinate children into their fold. \n\nYour tennis false equivalence is... Weird. The actual equivalent would be if a tennis club demanded public schools in the area use their facilities and every student *had* to go play tennis twice a week. Only, tennis teaches useful skills and is actually healthy so that probably wouldn't get too many complaints. It's more like if a d&d club did it. \n\nYou fail to understand the concept of atheism at its core, I think you think we have a belief system focusing on non-belief. There is no belief system with atheism, so we can't want to \"expand\" it, it's simply a lack of belief. I think you're brain-trained to think about atheism like it's a religion but it's not. It's more like being apathetic politically; noone tries to expand \"not voting because I don't pay attention or care whatsoever about politics\" as a political ideology.",

As for race in the West this is applied to indigenous, non-light skinned, and/or non-European peoples though this isn't an exhaustive list. It favours the concept of equity over that of emperic equality to guarantee the success of certain, pre-approved classes of people. Its proponents go to great ends to morally and philosophically justify this, but annoyed enough the \"ends justify the means\", \"we know best\" of it tends to come out.\n\nI can see why it's so popular, it must be as enrapturing as religion to feel as though you are saving humanity from itself. I can also see why 80% of people grow out of it for the same reason.\n\nNow you, you tell me what does Critical Theory mean to you. No dioramas.",

Most of the time, I feel, that a religious text is brought to a school it is brought by a student for their own personal use. Perhaps they read through it during their free time, perhaps they use recess or a similar time to pray and they need that text to pray. Unlike Huckleberry Finn, or To Kill a Mockingbird, or some piece of literature that is used to demonstrate great literacy skills and writing formats, I'm under the impression through my own experience that the Bible, Qaran, Book of Mormon, ect. are mostly recreational texts for a school setting and it doesn't make much sense to ban recreational texts, especially if they're valued by the people who consume them. I can understand the person's point, with passages from the Bible not being very clean but the Bible, to my knowledge, isn't all about that.",

They just escaped from Sodom(IIRC) which God was destroying, and were in the desert.\n\n>Genesis chapter 19\n\n>30 Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. \n\n>31 One day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cOur father is old, and there is no man around here to lie with us, as is the custom all over the earth. \n\n>32 Let\u2019s get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father.\u201d\n\n>33 That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and lay with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.\n\n>34 The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cLast night I lay with my father. Let\u2019s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\u201d \n\n>35 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went and lay with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.\n\n>36 So both of Lot\u2019s daughters became pregnant by their father. \n\n>37 The older daughter had a son, and she named him Moaba; he is the father of the Moabites of today. \n\n>38 The younger daughter also had a son, and she named him Ben-Ammib; he is the father of the Ammonites of today.\n\nIt should be noted that the city was destroyed because a few angels went there(although I believe no one knew they were actual angels), and apparently this place was so wicked that a bunch of people followed them because they wanted to rape them. They escaped to Lot's house, and asked Lot to send them out. And Lot instead said \"Hey, I have 2 virgin daughters yall can have instead.\" So this is how God's people work, apparently.",

If you get someone drunk to take advantage of them, that's generally considered rape. \n\nIf you have sex with someone and they are not cognizant enough to know what's going on, that's generally considered rape.\n\nIf they pass out, and you have sex with them, that's generally considered rape. \n\nI'm not sure if you're actually a right wing Christian defending the Bible or just don't see a problem with those things, but the fact that you read that and are still here saying thats not clear enough makes me think it's probably one of those two.

'I want you,' he said. Her eyes flicked downward, and her lips curved ever so slightly. 'I know.'\"\n\"'Tonight,' he whispered, his voice hoarse and hot in her ear, 'I will make you mine.'\"\n\"Now \u2014 now that he had her in his arms, her breath fast and uneven with desire, her eyes glazed with need she couldn't possibly comprehend \u2014 now he thought he might explode.\"\n\nA lot of times people are not clear about which definition of \u201cexplicit\u201d they\u2019re using. \n\nI also don\u2019t think that just because something is described that means that it is endorsed. So the Bible (and other books that have been sought to be banned which describe for example, rape or murder) does describe incestuous rape, but that is not the same thing as saying that it\u2019s good.  I think to argue that it does takes the same kind of mental gymnastics that you see from people trying to ban books where the main character is raped by saying that it encourages a thing when it just describes it.",

Do you think a God capable of creating the universe, a God who is all knowing and all powerful would sentence a Muslim boy to eternal torture for listening to his parents and priests? Do you think Allah would want you to burn in hell for eternity for listening to your parents and priests instead of becoming a Muslim? It's make believe, wishful thinking, etc. Have you looked at the state of our planet lately? Does it appear to be the work of a divine being to you? Believe whatever you want to believe, but you should examine those beliefs every now and then. I bet you think scientology is crazy because they believe in aliens and lord xenu. Yet you think a Virgin had a baby that could walk on water, turn water into wine, died and came back after 3 days. Seems just as crazy as the lord xenu story if you ask me.",

Kicked out of Eden, not a very good gift. Also the Bible is pretty damn clear that the only way to go to heaven is to accept Jesus as your personal lord and savior. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. John 3:16. My great uncle was a legit war hero, fought in Korea and carried an injured soldier back to safety while injured himself after an ambush at night. He was one of those guys who would give you the shirt off his back. He also didn't believe in God or believe in Jesus. Your holy book pretty clearly says he is now suffering for eternity in hell. Meh, I don't have the answers and admit I could be wrong. However I will not worship an egotistical jealous God who has the power to stop terrible things from happening to good people and chooses not to. So even if your God is real, fuck him. Lol",
