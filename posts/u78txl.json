Luckily I was wearing a life jacket and had my phone around my neck in a waterproof pouch y hat  was able to use to call my brother for help. I was still stuck out there bobbing and heavy waves in a life jacket for 25 minutes until they were able to find me. Also, funnily enough, it was very difficult to use my phone while getting pounded by the waves, so I first accidentally called my ex girlfriend and yelled about being stranded a mile out in the water for a while until I realized what happened.\n\nWe did end up getting back together, so maybe it was all worth it",
