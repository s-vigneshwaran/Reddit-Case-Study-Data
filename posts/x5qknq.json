As far as male stats are concerned, id like to know how these ststs are collected as well. Also, do males report assault the same way? Are assaults and rapes victimizing men stigmatized and therefore not reported. Again, not to reduce the impact on women, but I think the attention to the impact on  men is underreported or poorly/not collected and therefore comparisons of male vs other gender sexual assault needs to be clarified.",

I read each of your resources, unlike you, apparently.\n\nThe TIME article suggests that men\u2019s sexual assault incidents are underreported, and that male children are more likely at risk than female ones, not that the entire rape rates of men exceeds that of women.\n\nThe Chatham House article outlines how societal perceptions of sexual violence against males are harmful and need to change, but nowhere does it suggest that it exceeds that of women. \n\nThe 1-in-6 article suggests that more men have been victims of sexual violence than we likely know about, but do not indicate that they experience more than women.\n\nI know it\u2019s probably hard for your small brain to grasp, but reading comprehension and complex thought clearly aren\u2019t your strong suit, and you\u2019d rather resort to ad hominem and straw men instead.\n\nClearly, based on your response and how you talk to other people, life hasn\u2019t been kind to you in some way or another. For that, I\u2019m truly sorry and I hope that you find peace.",

How is this anything close to a reasonable worldview unless you\u2019re obsessed with your own victimization and projecting for some reason?\n\nMost of us just want to be able to make it to the grocery store without incident. Spend time with our friends, do our hobbies, go to work without worrying that coworkers will assault us, go online and not have our lives threatened in any serious capacity, like anyone else, who may not even have to think about it every day. Other people have plenty of ways of suffering, face plenty of oppression for all kinds of reasons, and we should do whatever we can to prevent that, too. I don\u2019t think anyone said you have to advocate for only one group at a time, you can just like\u2026 generally give a shit about preventing violence and allowing people basic dignity and freedoms, and that covers literally everyone\n\nTrans people are 4x more likely than cis people to be the victim of a violent crime regardless of gender. If we care about reducing violence and crime in general, that\u2019s a relevant statistic. Clearly you care more about exhaustively whining about people bringing up facts that challenge your worldview, so I can\u2019t help you there, but I sincerely hope you can work through whatever it is that makes you act like this.",

All they care about is doing something hateful and dominating over the other person, and unfortunately because being trans is sexualized to people like this, the focus of violence is often sexual assault.\n\nBut let's say if, hypothetically speaking, it IS two different types of people doing the sexual assault and physical assault. Trans people are still more likely to be sexually assaulted, so that point feels kind of moot.",

The US, Canada, Scandinavia, Western Europe, Japan, South korea and the wealthier parts of China are fairly safe for lgbt people if you go into areas like Chechnya, Russia, Brazil, South Sudan its a very very diffrent story. \n\nI live in the bible belt of Canada and even here most people dont care.

Then there are random one off murders with strangers which is still usually the result of an altercation. Considering that trans people make up such a small sample of the population, trans women even more so, it's a clear trend. Texas leads the country in transgender murders, and Dallas accounts for half. It's a hate crime, and it's terrifying for the trans community to know that even if they avoid dangerous people and altercations, there are people who will hunt them down to kill them simply because of who they are. That's a type of fear no one should have to face.",

It's not giving facts, it's giving spin and lies.\n\nThe fact sex workers are more frequently the victims of violence doesn't change anything, the fact that trans people are often discriminated against for other jobs and often have to turn to sex work is *part of the problem*.\n\nYou didn't explain anything away (or rather, the crusty old TERFs you're parroting) you discovered part of the explanation but were too dumb and angry to realize that. \n\nNo one here is minimizing violence against women. Trans women are victims of that too. \n\nIt's just a disgusting and pathetic attempt by you to try and argue that even acknowledging discrimination and violence against trans people is somehow harmful so that you and your TERF cohorts can continue to discriminate and encourage violence against them. \n\nYou're full of hatred and you're a little bit responsible for every single act of violence and discrimination against trans people. This isn't some hypothetical you can debate about hiding behind a screen name and then forget about, this is affecting real people and you're partially responsible for everything that happens to them.

Because they're smart and trying to manipulate stupid people?  Neither reason is good, but let's put it into proportion since you're obviously trying to condone people being murdered (I'm willing to argue that condoning murders is also evil, but that's for another day).\n\n>Transgender people are over four times more likely than cisgender people to experience violent victimization, including rape, sexual assault, and aggravated or simple assault, according to a new study by the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. In addition, households with a transgender person had higher rates of property victimization than cisgender households. [Source](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/ncvs-trans-press-release/)\n\n4x more likely to experience violence.\n\n>Sadly, 2021 has already seen at least 57 transgender or gender non-conforming people fatally shot or killed by other violent means. **We say at least because too often these stories go unreported \u2014 or misreported.** In previous years, the majority of these people were Black and Latinx transgender women. [Source](https://www.hrc.org/resources/fatal-violence-against-the-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-community-in-2021)\n\nSo, 57 people, not 50. I also had to emphasize a point for you. That source continues:\n\n>In 2020, HRC tracked a record number of violent fatal incidents against transgender and gender non-conforming people. A total of 44 fatalities were tracked by HRC, marking 2020 as the most violent year on record since HRC began tracking these crimes in 2013.\n\nSo, 2020 had a record number, and 2021 had a record number that was 30% greater... That's a trend, bud, and the idea is to have homicides trending downward\ud83d\udcc9, not up\ud83d\udcc8.\n\nIt's especially worrisome, because the trend of homicides in America has been down \ud83d\udcc9.\n\nOr are you arguing that is ok that the rate is increasing? Certainly sounds like it by the \"it's an epidemic\" attempt at sarcasm. I use attempt, because typically data has to back up sarcasm for it to not just be idiocy.\n\nYou're verbiage just screams that you yell, \"DON'T TREAD ON ME,\" and then you whisper, \"*but I can tread on Trans-people.*\" Hate is ignorance after all.",

Theres always the issue of some effect on the user but it's not goning to be nearly as sever as a direct hit. I'd recommend carrying both pepper spray and a firearm thats what i do, i'm in the US and here pepper spray is considered below pushing/physical contact on the threat escalation scale so you can legally spray someone who's threatening, trying to hit, or has hit you and be fine whereas pulling out your gun in some scenarios where the person isn't trying to kill you would get you arrested. It's best to have both so for a small issue you can use pepper spray like just to stop an unarmed robber or angry person and the firearm as a fallback if the situation escalates.",

Think of the two prongs on a stun gun like the starting line and finish line of a racetrack. If you're running a race you want to take the shortest possible path to the finish line. When you zap your friend Tom, the charge has to run through whatever part of Tom's body is blocking the way on that racetrack. So it's a localized charge; it will go through the part of Tom's arm being zapped between the two prongs but it's not going to go past the finish line prong and keep going/ spread out to you.\n\n(It's like in Forest Gump when he's running and they put up signs that say ***\"STOP, FOREST!!\"*** The charge doesn't need to run anymore. It stops at the second prong.)\n\nNow poor Tom gets electrocuted when he hits an ungrounded wire with a metal tool at work. The reason you could get zapped if you touch him is because that charge has a starting line but no finish line. Forest will just keep on running. It's not a grounded charge. Without the finish line the charge will spread to you, too, and keep going until it finally spreads to a material that can absorb it. I'm not the right person to explain suitable grounding materials/ insulators/ electrodes, but our bodies aren't the best at that.\n\n--------------- (I'll concede that a little bit of the stun gun charge gets distracted during the race and goes into Tom's muscles because they also like electrical charges. And stun guns do want that, as long as it's not enough to disrupt your heart. But that part of the charge still wants to go back to the finish line, it was just Forest getting distracted by a butterfly on the way there or something. It doesn't go very far off-track.)",

Suicide is a product of opportunity. When you take away opportunities to do it, suicide rates plummet. \n\nAn example of this is when England switched their ovens from coal gas to natural gas. Coal gas has deadly carbon monoxide and natural gas barely gas any. Before the switch, nearly half of suicides were from inhaling oven gas. When they got rid of it, suicides fell 30% and stayed that way.\n\n[Source](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92319314)",

However, you also have to consider that just because someone is more likely to die by suicide (which can really be anyone in a marginalized, highly criticized socio-economic demographic) does it mean they shouldn't be allowed to make a decision for themselves to have or not have a handgun?",

One poke can be fatal and even blocked slashes will slice someones arms to the point they can't move them anymore, if you also have pepper spray then the person is fighting into you while blind too. Also good pepper spray would make the knife likely not needed, pepper spray isn't like movies where people power through most of the time. If you get pepper sprayed it doesn't just burn the eyes but literally causes temporary blindness, bruns eyes and skin, and damages the respiratory system making it very hard to breathe, along with most sprays also containing dyes that don't wash off easily so if the person escapes after they're easily identifiable by police.\n\nStun gun is probably the worst option since it's chance of working is much lower than others, just hitting like a pocket or thick clothes can prevent it from activating",

You should *ALWAYS* try to maintain distance, whether armed, unarmed, experienced or not, so that if someone wants to hit you, you won't get hit.  And if they draw a knife, you stop fighting and you fucking run, unless you have a gun, then you fucking pull it and you pull that fucking trigger until they stop moving.

Because one has a knife and the capability to be effective with it does not mean they should whip out the shurikens to the beat of a gun thriller style. I'm saying considering a small knife is much more lethal than the vast majority of pistol calibers with a metric of sheer blood loss and soft tissue damage it would be wise to make a knife a strong consideration for a backup weapon I'd rather have than not. \n\nConsidering things like gun fights most often happen in low light situation, as does most violent crime, a flashlight is also an excellent choice for one's \"tip of the spear\". You're not going to hospitalize anyone with a pocket light but you can't hold every sketchy person in the night at gun point either. Lighting up would be assailant(s) in the dark is a good show stopper before anybody even acts up. Plus your lawyer will *really* appreciate it. \n\nOC spray is good too, personally though I hate the idea of carrying a pressurized can on me, let alone full of that shit, but it is very effective. Moreso than tasers, which I consider seasonal to hot weather when people are lightly layered. Plus OC is also crowd control and tasers are not.",

Knives are extremely simple by comparison, usually much easier to keep edge alignment with, and far, far easier to attack with quickly.  Sure, you do need to know how to move your body, but a few weeks at a boxing gym to learn the basics of how to move your hands will translate with extreme ease to use a knife capably.  Or any other martial art, because there's not that much difference between throwing a hook punch and slashing with a knife, or a straight punch and a thrust.  Knives are pretty much the shortcut to defensive weapons, so long as you still treat it with care and there is *NEVER* any harm to learning as much as you can.",

Then it has a reverse effect where people now don't want to be friends with rapists but they dont want to lose their friends and so they deny evidence right in front of their face and get reactive when they're confronted with it.\n\nThe cognative dissonance leads people to believe either if you got raped it was because you were associating with the wrong kind of people OR the word rape is getting thrown around so much these days it doesn't mean anything anymore.",

Transgender people were as likely as cisgender people to report violence to police.\u201d\n\nIf those two statements are related, as they appear to be, then I believe what\u2019s being said is that \u201cabout half of all violent victimizations *of cis women* are not reported,\u201d and that is incorrect. It\u2019s thought that between 60 and 80% of sexual assault wherein a woman is the victim are not reported to police (I won\u2019t begin to guess about men or any other group, but having been a survivor and worked with survivors\u2019 outreach, I can confidently speak on this one statistic). \n\nAlso, since the UCLA study has used data from the NCVS which relies on (1) willingness to report/speak to a surveyor, (2) individual memory/forthrightness, it would be helpful if not crucial to know when or at what point in an individual\u2019s life the sexual assault occurred. For example, if a woman is sexually assaulted ten years prior to transition, and now lives her life as a trans man, how would that be reflected within the reporting? This question potentially lends itself to skewed results. \n\nFinally, I notice that there\u2019s a quick mention of sexual violence, in fact it just literally says \u201cincluding sexual assault,\u201d but none of the key points listed mentions it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good to toss rape into a pool of general crime, that\u2019s sort of an extra smattering of victimization for the victims, so I\u2019d love it if this study were a little bit more specific about that aspect, given the assertion that trans women and men are four times more likely than cis women to be raped. Not saying it didn\u2019t happen but I need to know more. \n\nDo you have a link to the study itself? I couldn\u2019t find it, but I\u2019m sorta distracted and maybe I just missed it on google. I\u2019d really need to see it before I can say much more.",

These include, but are not limited to:\n\nRudeness towards other Redditors,\n\nSpreading incorrect information,\n\nSarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.\n\n#Am I banned from the Reddit?\nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n#I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

The potential victim was instructed to implore their rapist to wear it.  Once put on, barbs would spike out, ensnaring the penis of a male rapist, and causing some blood loss.  If he were to go to the hospital, the police could be notified, as the condoms were only supposed to be used during assault.  I believe it was developed in South Africa.  It\u2019s been a long time, probably 20 years, but I\u2019m curious if anyone else remembers it.  \n\nAs for the pants, I think something like the condom would be more effective.  This is just\u2026well, it\u2019s an erection in yoga pants, and isn\u2019t going to deter anyone.  These pants just make me sad, especially as trans individuals are one of the most vulnerable groups regarding sexual assault.  The intent was there, but it\u2019s clear whomever designed this, knows absolutely nothing about sexual assault.  If this is a joke, it just makes me sad to be honest, especially as a survivor.",

Because they were so androgynous, it's difficult to tell if they're a man or a woman. When one the men were trying to figure out if they're a man or a woman, they assumed they were a trans woman and got furious. The men started to chase them and angrily asking if that's a man because they felt humiliated that they were expressing attraction to a trans woman. They were able to escape, but that event was very scary. I almost got sexually assaulted when I told a stranger I was nonbinary.\n\nI don't know, people are creepy towards women, but if they're LGBT, the creepiness gets increased 100%. I hate it when people assume trans women won't get sexually assaulted and harassment just because they have different genitalia. In fact, it does the opposite, not only do they have to deal with violent insecure men, they also have to deal with creepy chaser sex pests. I don't know why people think that LGBT is an invitation to sexual advances, especially from cishet men.",

Its called trade negotiations, and we are hardly suffering the most in this fuel shortage. We still have lower gas prices than most of the world, and our military is larger than the next 7 countries combined. We are not hurting ourselves by negotiating with our fuel reserves. \n\nMarines who died in Afghanistan - it was a potential risk, and hardly the first administration to have soldiers die under their watch. That's not something unique to the left or Biden. \n\nRecord Inflation - this is controlled solely by the federal reserve. Biden had nothing to do with it, and he inherited a suffering post-pandemic economy. Completely irrelevant. \n\nAnd I wont even talk about Hunter Biden,  because who cares, other than the alt right. Nobody cares. Literally nobody. \n\nStop drinking the alt right, divisive, unamerican propaganda.",

My comment was just my opinion that essentially hiding isn\u2019t an effective strategy to deal with predators. Ideally we wouldn\u2019t need to watch out for evil, but the fact of reality is that will never happen so it\u2019s prudent to be able to protect yourself however necessary",
