I remember this native kid, couldn't have been over 23, came into the place I was a manager at. I befriended him slightly over the course of a year, he came in every day for smokes and drinks. Anyways he always paid his bill with cash and always had a fucking huge wad of $100s. In talking like over 5 grand in his front pocket at any time. I asked him one day why so much cash and not a card, he says he doesn't bother with banks, his tribe owned one of the casinos, he was set for life. He told me flat out he had no ambition and planned to just aimlessly wander through life finding things that interest him until he dies.\n\nAlso side story, one of the casinos had a dispute of tribal ownership and a contesting tribe stormed the casino and took it over by force. So the government got involved and somehow was able to shut down the casino until the tribes resolved the dispute. \n\n\nhttps://www.kmjnow.com/2019/03/11/another-takeover-attempt-as-rival-groups-dispute-chukchansi-tribal-leadership/",

Obviously this requires a lot of money to start up, but this is a huge plus for them.\n\n[Here's the article I found on it, please do correct me or the article if it's wrong.](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/25137/10-things-you-need-know-about-indian-reservation-gambling)\n\nI argued something like this in the past, but was a lot more harsh saying, \"They lost a war and were forced to move, that was the times.\" However, giving it more consideration, there isn't an excuse for things to be like that now considering the American ideals. \n\nOut of my pure curiosity, what would some people recommend be done to help Indian Reservations or the people within them? I'm a huge gas guy, don't like high prices and closing out gas lines did cause an increase, so I didn't like the idea of it not being allowed to go through a reservation. But now I feel like I was being too harsh and not thinking for them but rather for myself.",

Western civilization has always had \"rules\" about war and what they did to the Native Americans does not qualify under their own rules. Their goal was never to subjugate the Natives, too make them a vasal state or something, it was to eliminate them. It was pest control. Their land was stolen and they were slaughtered, those that lived where forced to renounce their religion, language, and names. It was genocide. Calling it a war is a revisionist take that makes people feel batter because they can imagine their ancestors were justified in their actions and that the Natives somehow posed any real threat too the colonists. Natives were never able too fight back in any meaningful way because westerners had weapons that far out stripped theirs. It was a long, protracted, one-sided slaughter. Try reading some history written by Native Americans/First Nations people. It is very eye opening. If you would you would see that any benefits that the US government choose too grant too Natives is a pittance in comparison too what was taken away from them. And my suggestion for improvement would be too ask THEM what they would have done. Or to do any of the things they have already ask for.",

Trumpism the dominant movement in the present day Republican party is a white supremacist movement. You also know this even if you claim otherwise.\n\nWhile Trump was a Democrat up until the year he ran as a Republican it does not make him a white supremacist, truthfully most Democrats are not white supremacist and this has been the case since the founding of their party, simply a good portion of them are.\n\nTrumpism as the progressives have coined it is nationalism and it is no more racist then the other nationalist movements around the world, nationalism is just a form of extreme tribalism where people focus on the benefit of their community before the benefit of others.\n\nOnce again you should actually learn about things before you start critiquing them.\n\n\n>If your claims were true. Republicans would be First in line tearing down confederate statues.\n\nYou do not change history by attempting to conceal or erase it, despite the best attempts by the Democrats to hide the crimes they've committed.\n\nYou should also keep in mind that alongside those Democrats statues they were tearing down they also tore down a few Republicans statues, in particular the statue of Frederick Douglass which the Democrats decapitated before they threw it in the river.\n\nYou've been lied to and you should spend a lot of time studying and less time listening to propaganda.\n\n\n>After all it is certainly true that thie confederates voted for the nineteenth century version of the democratic party. \n\nMore of the Democrats learned the art of propaganda and begin spreading it through the civil rights movement in an attempt to displace their own history with simplistic lies that they continuously repeat.\n\nIn particular is the lie that one day they just all woke up and traded places with the Republicans, even though you could clearly watch their continued actions after that and see that there was no change and even to this day they continue to obsess over race.\n\nThey've got some people so propagandize that they don't even see that their campaign to give everybody their own racially safe space is a reamp of their Jim Crow laws and their segregation ideology.\n\n\n>So obviously Republicans want to tear down the statues honoring white supremacist traitors who were all democrats right? \n\nAs I said, trying to erase history by destroying the statues of the Democratic party is not a priority to the Republicans, why do you think liberals support the Republican Party over the Democrats, they are sane enough to know that the Democrats will take down their own statues when they grow up and stop being so racist.",

There you will find the ancient ruins of what is the last remains of the archives. You have to ring the bell three times; when the glowing sphere rises, when it is burning the strongest, and when it falls into the pit of darkness at then end of the cycle.\n\nA bird will let you know each time, screeching through the empty, long forgotten chambers; for it is tied to the sphere through a spell immemorial. Its eyes will glow, one being a wheel of fire, the other an empty void that will haunt you forever, and the third an icy crystal filled with lightning. Do not look at the eyes. Do not count the eyes. Simply *listen*.\n\nAs you ring the bell for the third time, the gates will open and you shall enter into the halls of knowledge, where all history, the true history of everything has been depicted. You shall drink from the cup that has been prepared by the archivist, as it gives you the ability to see what lies beyond the walls. \n\nThere are no books, because you can't learn history from books. But there will be moving images, shadows scurrying across the painted walls, telling the story of what once was. You shall not take notes, because it is forbidden. You have to watch and remember. All of it. \n\nAs you walk through the endless corridors, you will learn more about the true fate of our ancestors and their ancestors and the ancestors who came before them. It will occupy your mind, but you shall not retreat now because you are after the sacred truth that reveals what was, long before anything was what it was. \n\nYou will encounter truths that will break your mind. You will falter, but you will prevail. And you will *remember*. Because what is history of everything has not been recorded, *can not* be recorded; it would burn the pages it is written on in an instant and dissolve the mind of the reader. It is not how we teach, hence you have to see what was in order to understand, in order to comprehend.\n\nRemember, as you try to keep your sanity and delve deeper into the archives of what once was: the truth will consume you, but it will also free you. From what is known to be what is.\n\nThe barber knew too well, hence became a barber after the reemergence.\n\nIt is up to you now; but you can't learn history from books.",

And I don\u2019t mean, has he given it away, though I do think with that kind of money, you should donate to charity, create a charity, etc. But has he used that money to make more money? If so, how? Has he used it in other ways? Did he just simply disappear?\n\nThe thing is, most people who are successful, make their first millions by luck. Like it or not, it is luck. And the people who admit that are very rare, but tend to give back more. They help others, they are charitable, they are giving.  Maybe the Minecraft creator is one and has gone on to do good for the world. If so, quite the anomaly, but great.\n\nI\u2019d still say there is absolutely no reason in the world to stay a billionaire. Give back, help the world. There is so much suffering. I don\u2019t care where you make a difference. If it were creating a school to create technology like Minecraft, great! If it\u2019s scholarships for people a foundation selects to give tech education to people, great. It doesn\u2019t have to be about poverty or food or clothes. Give back any way. There is no way to spend a billion dollars, nor any reason to hang onto a billion dollars. Use the money for good, and try. If I had a billion dollars, I\u2019d spend all day finding ways to spend it.\n\nWasn\u2019t it Bezos\u2019s ex who got a divorce and gave away a huge portion of her fortune? I\u2019m not a Gates fan, but invest in a cause, create a foundation. There are as many things in this world to make better as  there are dollars in their accounts. Dolly Parton and other celebs gave millions to covid vaccine research. \n\nMost average people give far, far, far more, as a percent of income and total wealth, each year, than most billionaires. Fuck, poor people give more. \n\nIf I had a billion dollars, I\u2019d make it my goal to NOT have a billion dollars. I wouldn\u2019t go broke, but, again, no one needs that kind of money. And the more they hold onto, the more others are hurting and being ignored.",

So the billions were mostly made upon sale, but Mojang wasn't hurting by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nMicrosoft's purchase may have led to more plastic toys, I'm not sure about that timeline.\n\nIf we work within the framework that people should be paid for their work, then there's no ethical conflict here, unless the person who owned the rights to the game was unfairly compensating the developers that worked on the game from 2012 until the sale.\n\nNone of this matters because that is a huge fluke, and the chances of that happening in the same way are low enough that we could probably count on one or two hands how many times it'll occur in our lifetimes.",

The confidently incorrect person was the one being paraphrased in quotation. \n\nAre you saying we can't make a determination because we don't have the original email to the tweet author or the author's article?\n\nI guess you can say we don't have enough information. However let's go with what we do know:\n\nUpon being asked about dumb things they've heard, author of tweet was reminded of a time that someone linked them an article about 10 billionaires that were in/from India, as a reply to author's article about the rank poverty of Native Americans.\n\nThe author, for the sake of this little discussion, should be assumed to be truthful, however this works even if it contains a straw man. The author of the tweet says that their article was about poverty among \"Native Americans.\" This means that \"Native American\" is both explicit and implicit. The person who contacted the author searched \"rich Indians\" on Google and came up with an article, and linked that to the author.\n\nThere's no claim, it's an anecdote related to the prompt of the original tweet.\n\nAssuming that the author is not a liar and this actually happened, the \"confidently incorrect\" part is thinking one is \"disproving\" the author's article in **two** ways. First, that 10 billionaires means there is not poverty. Secondly, the factual error of pointing at 10 billionaires on another continent as proof there is no poverty among \"Indians\" in the US.\n\nThere's not a whole lot of extrapolation going on here, the only assumptions we have to make as outside observers is that the author is relating a true story, however it doesn't even matter.",

No reasonable judge would ever except your \"proof\" in court. \n\nIt's impossible to prove what someone thinks based on what they have written. \n\nWhat is possible though, is to prove what someone has **claimed**. Because then you only need to look at the words written or said. If someone writes \"The moon is blue\" then it is perfectly reasonable to say that they claim that the moon is blue. What they actually believe is irrelevant in that case. But this only works for things actually said or written, **verbatim**. The moment you start to speculate on what someone meant, you do exactly that, you **speculate**. Your theory might be **likely**, but that's still not **proof**.",
