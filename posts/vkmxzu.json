I\u2019m extremely angry towards them. \n\nThey do nothing but shove their beliefs down everyone\u2019s throats, they\u2019re so arrogant that they don\u2019t consider other possibilities, and they take pride in taking rights away from women and treating them like birthing machines. I hate them now. And I will be boycotting every religious business I can. \n\nMy family and bf are Christians and while I don\u2019t hate them, I am disgusted that they agree with this. I take birth control pills for mostly my irregular period cycle because before they would be very irregular and painful. If they take contraceptives away, they\u2019ll be affecting my health. \n\nThey don\u2019t care about human life and all the aborted fetuses that could have been born like they say they do. They just want to demote women to birthing machines and take their rights. And, I hate them for it. I refuse to coexist with them except for my family and bf.",

                          "text": "I can point you to subjects to pursue.  The aftermath of the crusades, medieval inquisitions, the age of discovery, its dominion over Europe.\n\n> During the centuries-long Christian domination of Europe, skilled torturers used methods and devices to prolong the life of the prisoner as much as possible while inflicting the greatest agony. People were literally sawed in half, either across the body or along body length. Heads were crushed between two metal plates that closed like a vise. The handle of the vise was cranked, crushing the skull and facial bones. If the torture stopped before death, the victim would suffer permanent facial disfigurement. Torturers also crushed victims\u2019 knees, ripped off women\u2019s breasts, and systematically broke bones to prolong the torture for days. Another one of these disturbing methods was rat torture. Prisoners were tied down with starving rodents placed on their bare skin over their stomach. A metal container was placed over the rat, trapping it. The metal container was then gradually heated until the rodents began to claw and eat their way out through the stomach of the restrained victim.\n\n> [Source](https://emersongreenblog.wordpress.com/2018/08/12/the-gruesome-history-of-christian-torture/)\n\nThat article also sources plenty of books if you're interested.\n\n_____\n\nAnd as that article puts it (beautifully), Christianity has a long and romantic relationship with torture.  Not just organizationally and historically, but foundationally.\n\n> In a text called the Apocalypse of Peter, Jesus shows the disciple Peter the terrors of hell. Blasphemers are hanged by their tongues, adulterers are suspended by their genitals, doubters have their eyes continually burned out with red-hot irons, abortionists are buried in excrement up to their necks, idol worshipers are recurringly chased off of cliffs, and slaves who disobeyed their masters chew out their own tongues eternally.\n\nAnd it ends very succinctly:\n\n> I think we ought to remember the terrible consequences that arose logically out of Christian faith. If you look at the historical accounts, these were not psychopaths who would\u2019ve tortured anyway. I\u2019m sure there were sadists who enthusiastically volunteered for the job, but there were simply too many of these people for them to have all been psychopaths and sadists; and their motivation, in the light of scripture, is all too clear. There was a theological justification for every horrific act and impulse that I\u2019ve spoken about, and it wasn\u2019t theological progress that caused the gradual decline of torture.\n\n> ...It\u2019s simply a fact that this is how Christianity behaved for the majority of its existence, and it\u2019s worst behavior was during the time when it had the most political power and the most power over our minds.\n\nIt purports to be about love, but it is very much about gruesome punishment and terror.",

Magical thinking always being bad only seems to work in the sense of \"that which can be destroyed by truth should be.\"\n\nSure, Jaines thinking that they're observance of the sacredness of life may play into the cosmological scale of karma and their pursuit of Nirvana is selfish, and is rooted in fiction, and it's not nice to deceive people with stories that aren't backed up by objective facts. But a consequentialist approach looks at this and says that these are people who don't want to harm any other living beings, and don't want to push their morals on to others, what's the harm? \n\nI mean the worst thing they can do is raise their children like that instead of letting them come to a decision for themselves organically I guess.

Being deluded helps no-one, and it does victimize people.\n\nHere's a paper from a site with Jain all over it written by an expert. \n\n[JAINA DOCTRINE OF KARMA: The Religious and Scientific Dimensions](https://jainworld.jainworld.com/pdf/JAINA_DOCTRINE_OF_KARMA.pdf)\n\nPublisher: Dharam Darshan Sewa Samsthan, 55, Ravindra Nagar, Udaipur 313003, Rajasthan, India\n\nAuthor: [Dr. N.L. Kachhara](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=Dr.+N.L.+Kachhara)\n\n(name linked to a Google search for this person showing he has publications about Jainism and gives lectures)\n\nFrom [a bio](https://www.herenow4u.net/index.php?id=62442&person=551):\n\n\"Since retirement in 1997 he has been working for religious and social cause. Scientific spiritualism is his fond subject. He is particularly exploring the scientific nature of Jain philosophy on which he has authored half a dozen books. **He is currently engaged in interpreting Jaina beliefs and theories, particularly Doctrine of Karma and Duality**, in scientific perspective. He was invited by Parliament of World\u2019s Religions at Melbourne in Dec 2009 and presented a program on Jainism.\"\n\nOn to the paper.\n\nLook at the Naam (Body Making) Karma section, page 10 on. He clearly says it can give you disabilities, ugliness, etc. \n\nSpecifically, items 23, 24, 26, 30, 32, 36, 41. \n\nOn page 39:\n\n\"The working of DNA is supposed to be controlled by light photons emitted by the coherent magnetic field of Naam Karma in the Karma body. **Under the effect of feeling producing Karma these light photons can also produce faulty genes which cause disease of various kinds.\"**\n\n...stating that much disease is the result of karma.\n\nHe ends with, \"Lastly, we end with the hearty remark that **the Jaina doctrine** 'What you sow is what you reap' is perfectly scientific and true.\"\n\nThis Jainist expert specifically says here that **you get what you deserve to include disease and deformity,** and he has spent several pages listing diseases and deformities, attributing each one to a specific type of karma.\n\nHow is this information in conflict with the problem, that I have provided citations for, that in countries with belief in karma, the disabled are often victim-blamed because of that belief? His final emphasis on \"what you sow is what you reap\" in reference to karma and disease/deformity supports there being such a problem, and specifically includes Jainism.\n\nConcerning the problem of magical thinking, his paper is an example of the woo craziness (angels dancing on a pin) stuff I was saying makes no difference unless you are a believer. For example, the author states (p 35):\n\n\"The genetic science on the other hand offers only a limited view of body formation but it is hoped that with the advancement in genetic science more and more knowledge regarding body functions shall be gained and then perhaps *it will be discovered that what the modern science with the help of large fleet of highly qualified scientists and most sophisticated technology has found is already available in Jaina scriptures.*\"\n\n...which is a good example of why superstition is not innocent but harmful. He takes vague ancient woo and shoehorns recent scientific knowledge into it, claiming victory. (Yeah, ancient people thought up all the results of modern empirical science thousands of years ago by navel-gazing. Science exists only to prove religion. You can skip that step because religion is always right. It *already* (his words) has the answers. Be gullible, believe superstition!)\n\n1) A respected Jainist authority says karma causes disease/deformity, and those people deserve it. 2) He uses woo to elevate religious blind belief over empirical science. How much more do you need?",

Same as not voting, it is accepting a defeat and giving power to republicans and letting the country slide back.\n\nThe system is broken I agree, but there is no practical way to change it except to keep voting for Dems and keep pressuring them to do the right thing and fix the system.\n\nThis will probably take our lifetime. It is slow unfortunately, but real change can only come if the Democrats consistently win on all levels of government, when every roughly other election you lose power every decision they do becomes a calculation on how will it affect their job in the next election.\n\nYou can always vote/support for the Dem that you think is the most likely to make a change in the primary but in the actual election you still have to vote for whichever Dem won the primary if for nothing else just to make sure we don't slide backwards.",

Christians have been letting the theocrats among them steer the ship for far too long. They\u2019ve been quiet, choosing to appease their extremists instead of having disagreements that might cause schisms.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to us to sort out who\u2019s who, though.

All reason to believe in a risen christ which should've been a widely documented event by contemporary historians ceased, all reason to believe in an afterlife, purgatory, hell or heaven which is a very good selling point in religion ceased as well or the fear hell or to believe in the efficacy of prayer or miracles or testimony or anything at all.\n\nAll of it just fell away and I have not missed it one bit especially when I encounter the stories of other people and how they've suffered because of religion.\n\nIt wasn't rapid but it was quite gradual because some things went faster than others.",

Most civilizations had polytheistic (many gods) in their religion, as life was scary and their was a lot to explain. It also gave people many gods to fear and to worship and stay hopeful.\n\nThen as life became easier, more and more religions became monotheistic. They only needed one god as a nice little way to give them a (false) feeling of purpose and an explanation to deal with the pain of death.\n\nThe change was not easy though. In Ancient Egypt the first pharaoh to try to worship one god was meant with resistance. People are afraid of change.\n\nWhich brings us to today. Life for most normal and educated people is pretty easy, and religion is being phased out in many aspects. Except for these nitwit yahoos who have to life and are scared and cling to religion and \"winning\" to give their life meaning. \n\nMy only hope is they all die out before doing too much permanent damage",

      "text": "What I, and probably many others, have been struggling with for so long was the idea that one bad person's behavior somehow didn't reflect ill will on the part the institution of religion itself. It's been used as an excuse to NOT be anti-theist and we may have just reached a tipping point. When people do absolutely horrible, atrocious things in the name of faith why isn't the beloved hierarchy ever stepping forward and saying \"NO?\" For a long time the average person has been excusing everything from violence, discrimination, and political overreach as the work of individual, single extremists.\n\nI think that mental loophole just disappeared.\n\nAn anti-theism position is rational at this point because the institutional behavior of the faiths are themselves violent and perpetuating violence. They are collectively organizing to enforce harmful values on their non-members, at any cost. There has been absolutely zero concern by any hierarchy within any major religion on the planet about their followers' over-reach and over-step in trying to assert their values on others. If anything, its quietly applauded, at worst it's publicly celebrated and accelerated.\n\nI was long presented the view that Christianity was about forgiveness, mercy, or kindness. Ok. In my lifetime I've never seen it; when do they practice it!? The churches in my community have only EVER made the news or been visible when they fought AGAINST feeding the homeless, when the bishops fought AGAINST LGBTQ+ families marrying or adopting children, or when they covered up sexual abuse scandals. Or when they embezzled money.\n\nI'm not seeing the Russian Orthodox church do anything to condemn violence against the Ukrainian people. I'm not seeing the Catholics punish or excommunicate, say, Bill O'Reilly when he provoked the murder of Tiller and other medical doctors. We certainly aren't seeing them express any regret or concern for the welfare of women.\n\nBut, hey, collectively they are more than happy to stack up wins in getting federal funds for religious schools (despite separation of church and state) and extremist health bans (despite medical privacy) to match their current interpretation of a mistranslated bronze age book, right?\n\nEdit: I said this elsewhere - but honestly, if the Christians thought they were the persecuted lot in the world before because not enough people were saying 'Merry Christmas' to them during the month of December, the pure hatred they just earned from people worldwide might be eye opening for them.",

They were arrogant, whiny, privileged, self-pitying narcissistic over-reaching scum, but they were absolutely not persecuted. If anything, they were coddled. \n\nWhat just happened in the last week, between flipping Roe and deciding federal funding could go to religious schools?

Atheists can be idiots too.\n\n> Do Atheists oppress minorities and marginalized groups\n\nWell, consider that China is both, very atheist and also very oppressive. Atheism by itself doesn't make people better than others. \n\n\n> There was never such thing as coexistence.\n\nWhat do you suggest? Wiping religious people out of existence? What method do you prefer? Execution or re-education camps?",

It almost always comes back to the Ten Commandments which says:\n\n'Thou shall not kill'\n\nLet's accept these Christians idea that life begins at conception.  That ignores thousands of years of Christian concepts that life begins at the 'quickening' or the moment a woman feels the baby move.  In the past few centuries Christians have moved the goalposts without god 'burning another bush' to restate his position but let's assume they're right.\n\nThe bible is not a legal document.  It is a covenant between an individual and their chosen god.  'Thou shall not kill' does not mean \"Others shall not kill'.  It is a statement for when you die and you stand in judgement.  This commandment does not mean you can stand in judgement of others because you are not god.\n\nYet that's is what Christians are doing.  They are taking their personal beliefs and pushing them on to others.\n\nThroughout history Christians have loved to portray themselves as victims yet almost of that victimhood occurred almost two thousand years ago.  Since that time they've become bullies, many times converting others behind a sword or the barrel of a gun.  It is how the religion took over Europe, the Americas, and parts of Africa/Asia.\n\nChristians are what they preach against.  I don't believe in god but if one did exist, I doubt many would like how 'he' received them.",

I'm going to give you some food for thought to ruminate on, based on what I went through.\n\n1)  There are only two possibilities - your relationship with your bf could survive him reading that comment you just made or it couldn't.\n2)  If it couldn't, that suggests you're maintaining the relationship through deception, which is toxic and unfair to both him and you.  If the relationship is built on a lie you can't trust it not to crumble when you need it most.\n3)  If it could, then there are only two possibilities: he loves you so much this wouldn't change anything, or he loves you so little this wouldn't change anything.\n4)  In the too much case, you're taking advantage of him in the worst way.  This is tough and I'm not proud of when I was in this situation, because ultimately I managed the worst of both worlds: I let her be with me in this state for over a year, after which the guilt got too much and I robbed her of agency by dumping her for her own good.  I have no high hill to stand on and moralize, just laying out stuff for you to ponder.\n5)  In the too little case you're letting him take advantage of you in the worst way.  That's literally just letting him use you.  *Seriously* consider whether you're truly happier with him than you would be alone.\n\nI have more tactical advice I can give you in terms of successfully replacing him, but you and I both know you won't leave him because you think you have a real shot at doing better; you have to be convinced you'd be happier alone.  If you want fine-grained details about my life in your situation I'm gonna ask you to switch to dms.",

Often being the most vocal, they make very bad examples of Christ\u2019s fundamental message, especially to the young and impressionable.  \n\n\rAlso, I can see many institutional Christians even finding inconvenient, if not bothersome, trying to reconcile the conspicuous inconsistency in the fundamental nature of the New Testament\u2019s Jesus with the wrathful, vengeful and even jealous nature of the Old Testament's Creator. \n\n\rChrist's teachings epitomize the primary component of socialism \u2014 do not hoard morbidly superfluous wealth in the midst of poverty. And Jesus clearly would not tolerate the accumulation of tens of billions of dollars by individual people \u2014 especially while so many others go hungry and homeless. Today, when a public figure openly supports a guaranteed minimum income, he/she is nevertheless deemed communist/socialist and therefore somehow evil by many institutional Christians. It's bewildering, to say the least.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*P.S. Even more disturbing, just hours after the Uvalde-school mass slaughter of innocents, hard-right-wing radio-talk-show host Lars Larson was already defending the gun industry. He (or his superiors, if he has any) even continued broadcasting ads, which are in his voice thus likely making him extra money, selling the services of a business that assists people in accessing gun ownership that has been denied them by government regulations.*   \n   \n*Yet he has the morally-challenged audacity to openly call himself Christian (albeit Evangelical, a denomination known for being generally vocally/actively supportive of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency). Meantime, Republican Big-Gun-Industry-apologist senators and congress representatives, including Cruz, also consider/call themselves Christian. Jesus must be spinning! As one who believes in Jesus' unmistakable miracles, this greatly troubles me.*",

Religion will always preach ethic, while laws are designed from society's ethics, in democracy everyone gets to add their two-cents, those cents are dyed by people's environments (incl. church). It's impossible to separate church and state, instead it's an ideal, to strive for - to be better.\n\nChristians will disagree that they are shoving religion down your throat, it comes down to how it is framed. Most anti-abortionists use a simple argument that \"a fetus is human and musn't be killed\", as opposed to \"my bible says fetus have spirit and need animal sacrifice\". It's fucking complicated.\n\nBut you're right, religion is stupid. We are too used to normalizing Christianity, being told to respect it. The ethics and science are just wrong. Imagine a viking preaching that the world is on a tree and we should all enjoy eternal war, how bullshit that sounds, to Christians too, they just lack self-awareness. Christians base their life on scripture but need the excuse that it's not literal so they can't be criticized for what it says. \n\nReligion is an organization and ideology, people can be judged for those. But remember that religious beliefs are varied, and people are more than their religion.",

I just also see people try to over mix the two and that in the end doesn't aid in criticizing and fighting against the problems of religion, it really just aids the religions that are culturally dominant in enforcing their cultural norms through atheists too and ignore when the common religion does the same things.

Article got retracted for islamophobia and the author is continuously being called as islamophobe still on Twitter. Shall I lost more examples like this? It's not only ridiculous people advocating hate, it's also people that have been traumatized by Islam (usually brown people) who can't safely leave the faith because both their own stilluslim family and outsiders will label them islamophobes. Yes the writer of this article was a brown person who emigrated from an Islamic country.",

Thats just flat wrong and is committing the \"no true scottsman\" fallacy. \n\nIts not up for you to decide what real christian views are. Perhaps you know a christian that doesnt feel that his wife should be subservient to him. Which you agree with and so you say \"this must be the real christian view\".... \n\n\nBut neither view is the \"real\" christian view. If there were something that was the real christian view... then all christians would have no problem agreeing with what is clearly the \"real\" christian view. \n\nIf one takes a step back and looks at these people as believers in what is essentially a Bronze age cult which many if not most Christians in America (of the denominations which I listed for you) believe that women should be subservient.... \n\nThen what the poster said is accurate. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions.",

Even among the most fundamentalist Christians I know, this sentiment it ridiculous.\n\nAnd I would say the \u201cChristian\u201d idea on abortion differs whether you want to think on a doctrinal level or what actual Christian\u2019s believe in their personal lives.  \n\nThe Catholic Church and most Protestant churches would probably say that abortion ends the life of a child of god, and so they are thus opposed to it,\n\nMy friends and family who I have talked about abortion with in the last few days have all basically said: we believe that all human life is sacred.  But abortion should not be outlawed completely.  Some have said that rape/etc should allow abortion.  Other have said that abortion should be okay up until the fetus can survive without its mothers body.  \n\nEvery. Single. One. Without fail.  Has said that a mothers health should come before the fetus\u2019 and that abortion is ok to preserve the health of the mother.  \n\nThis is all coming from about 6 different conversations I\u2019ve had in the last few days with Christian\u2019s of varying intensity of belief. But idk\u2026 maybe I should still defer to you on what a \u2018true\u2019 Christian is?  \n\nLet me know.  I would love to be able to learn something more, o wise redditor.",

For some reason, I was born, or exposed to something at a young age, skeptical and not easily persuaded into indoctrination into cults/religions. Clearly others are the opposite of me.

I DON'T hate religion because bad people do bad things. Taliban don't represent Islam just like KKK doesn't represent Christianity. Both entities are pieces of literal human garbage, but to say anyone belonging to those faiths is horrible person is just blind hate, and that's not cool.\n\nYou're fear mongering an entire population of people over the actions of the few. The very notion that you'd read my comment about my wonderful friends and spout the shit you just said is absolutely mind numbing and pisses me off beyond belief. It's as if you're forgetting the US is the only nation in the world who suffers from near daily fucking mass shootings perpetrated by depressed white kids having a mental breakdown.\n\nIf you want to be against religion, that's fine. Just don't be a racist asshole trying to slander the few decent human beings left on this spinning inferno we call Earth.",

She died. Didn't make it half way. Never got to see her family again, never got to see anyone or anything she cared about or loved because you and yours took that from her in the name of your god whether it be Allah or Yahwey. Same fucking difference. So what about her consent? What about the kids she'll never get to have or see again? What about the consent of the women who don't want the child that was raped into them or the consent of women who have the right to have a dead sack of cells removed from their bodies after their body aborts it? Oh wait that's right I forgot, you don't condone them because they don't adhere to your god. \n\nCoward.\n\nSo fuck you bud. You're a weasel and no differnet than the things that call themselves men who blew up a [hospital ](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/world/asia/suicide-attackers-kill-at-least-29-in-afghan-bazaar.html) full of innocent people. It's all the same parasite of the mind you call a religion to us lowly athiests. That's how this goes now, and that's why us heretics or infidels or whatever you need to label us are so god damn pissed off now.\n\nFuck you and the Christian horse you rode in on.",
