It's your choices that reveal your character. If you claim that you don't support X, and then you turn around and voluntarily contribute time and money to *fund* X, you are a hypocrite and a liar.\n\n\nA lot of Catholics and Catholic-adjacent people like to make a big show of engaging in fake moral outrage, usually by making arguments beginning with \"I don't support pedophila, **but**...\", and think that this means they've done their part and are now absolved of all guilt.\n\nIt doesn't. This behaviour puts you on the level of the German Citizen who, while he isn't *personally* interested in murdering his Jewish neighbours, still cheers at Hitler's rallies, wears Swastika merchandise, and votes for the NSDAP. Citizens who quietly \"had grave reservations\" about \"a small minority of extremists\" who had \"lost sight of the F\u00fchrer's true message of peace\", but who kept those reservations to themselves because they're convinced that their *local* Gestapo officers were all \"very fine people\".\n\n Historians have a word for those people, and that word is \"Nazi\".\n\nYes, every single one of them.\n\n>By that logic every Muslim complicit with Islamist extremism/terrorism, \n\nCorrect. Probably not the point you were trying to make, but yes, this *does* apply to  people in other child rape cults as well.\n\nI get that it's scary to admit that you've been wrong for years, but sometimes it's necessary to do scary things before you can grow. I get that the desire to belong to a club is a big part of human nature. But couldn't you try picking a club that isn't **built on a foundation of Pure Evil**?",

So, if you want to split hairs about complicity, that's fine, but the Catholic Church has committed, and continues to commit crimes against humanity in an explicit and organized way, and if you give anything to the church, that's what you're paying for. It's not about painting the faithful with the same brush as the rapists.  It's about supporting the organizational machine which makes this systematic rape possible.  *Those crimes* are still ongoing.  You can put that into whatever moral bucket you want, but I don't think it's a good one.",

Unfortunately, like most Big Lies, it falls apart as soon as somebody shows up with actual data.\n\n>I think you should revisit the data.\n\nOkay, let's do that.\n\nIn Australia, for instance, it's estimated that, between 1950 and 2010, approximately 7% of Catholic priests  were involved in child sexual abuse in some capacity. In some specific orders, the rate is higher than *40%*. That's more than **two out of every five**.\n\nFor comparison, the occupation with the second highest rate of child abuse (teacher) was slightly less than one percent. When it comes to the kiddie-diddling race, The One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church isn't running in the middle of the pack. They aren't even ahead by a narrow margin. They've lapped everyone else **seven times over**.\n\n(Lest you think that the figures for Australia are anomalous, the rate in the USA is about 5.6%)\n\nSee also: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-02-06/child-sex-abuse-royal-commission:-data-reveals-catholic-abuse/8243890\n\nhttps://www.patheos.com/blogs/tippling/2017/06/30/catholic-clergy-likely-paedophiles-general-public/\n\n\nBut let's pretend for a moment that this claim **is** true. Let's pretend, against all evidence,  that a randomly selected priest is exactly as likely to be a practising paedophile as is a random florist or a random tax accountant. You would still have to deal with the fact that there is no organized conspiracy that moves child-molesting florists from flower shop to flower shop to escape the law, no multinational organization dedicated to concealing the crimes of tax accountants.\n\nLet's imagine that the ratio of child abusers who work as priests and those who work as public school teachers were magically set to 1:1 today. That would not be a *stable* equilibrium. Given that one profession goes to extreme lengths to protect and enable child abusers, and the other goes to extreme lengths to protect children *from* child abusers, that ratio wouldn't remain at 1:1 for very long.\n\nEven if this Big Lie is taken as read, the Catholic Church would still be **guilty as fuck**.",

I've got a family friend who's a real person with a functioning moral compass who finished seminary and then couldn't get a placement as a priest because all the possible churches were openly requiring conservative political alignment for the job.

He absolutely DOES have enough power to do something about huge systemic problems like this - one of the explicit powers of the Pope is excommunication, and it's hard to be a Catholic priest (or bishop etc) if you're not even Catholic anymore.\n\nProtestants, which constitute the majority of Christians, do not recognize the authority of the Pope, and he has no power over them. American Evangelicals mostly hate him, because even his lukewarm public statements re:climate change and stuff are too progressive for them.\n\nI'd liken it more to Emperor Hirohito than the Queen - he has a lot of power, but is hesitant to use it for political reasons.",

We must condemn that loudly and clearly. \nHowever, we might have a successor, who is much less progressive than Francis has been. From the point of view of conservative catholics he is pretty much a liberal revolutionary. \n\nWikipedia:\nFrancis maintains the views of the church regarding abortion, clerical celibacy, and the ordination of women, but has initiated dialogue on the possibility of deaconesses and has made women full members of dicasteries in the Roman Curia. He maintains that the church should be more open and welcoming for members of the LGBT community. Francis is an outspoken critic of unbridled capitalism and free market economics, consumerism, and overdevelopment;[2] he advocates taking action on climate change,[3] a focus of his papacy with the promulgation of Laudato si'. In international diplomacy, he helped to restore full diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, supported the cause of refugees during the European and Central American migrant crises, and made a deal with the People's Republic of China to define how much influence the nation has in appointing their Catholic bishops. Since 2017, Francis has been a vocal opponent of neo-nationalism and populism.[4][5] He has faced criticism from theological conservatives on many questions, especially what some interpret as his suggestion in a footnote of Amoris Laetitia that divorced and remarried Catholics may be admitted to receive the Eucharist.[6]\nSource: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Francis",

          "text": "> Like on par of dictator level?\n\nCorrect. Vatican City is the only remaining absolute monarchy in Europe.\n\nAs far as Church Law is concerned, the Supreme Pontiff is just that: Supreme. His power is absolute. There is no separation of powers. There is no independent legislative or judiciary branch. There are no re-elections to worry about. There are no checks or balances. If he wants to change the laws of the church, he doesn't need to convince anyone to approve his new policies. He can call for an Ecumenical Council to advise him *if he wants*, but he doesn't *have* to do so. He doesn't need to wait for anyone to vote. What he says, goes. If he declares that the sacrament of the Eucharist is only valid if the priest spreads marmalade on the cracker before casting the transformation spell, then that declaration becomes church law, immediately, no questions asked.\n\nIn fact, according to official Catholic Doctrine, the pope has the magical power to channel the voice of Yahweh Himself through his words, rendering them extra-super-double-infallible. Contrary to popular belief, this doesn't automatically apply to *everything* the pope says. It has to be officially invoked, which has only happened about a dozen times since it was formally defined in the 1800s. If he *doesn't* invoke this magical power, then he \"merely\" has the authority of an absolute monarch with no checks or balances as described above. That still means that all his employees have to do what he says, but you won't automatically be condemned to hell for privately disagreeing with it - only if you disagreed on a *really* important issue such as \"Did the Virgin Mary ever get laid *after* Jesus was born?\".\n\nOf course, his power isn't *actually* absolute, because he **is** subject to one *unofficial* check and balance: the possibility that his underlings might decide to assassinate him and replace him with someone who will immediately reverse all his changes. That same caveat has applied to every ruler in history, no matter how \"absolute\" they might believe themselves to be. If the biggest check on a person's political power is \"They're not physically indestructible\", you've got to admit that there isn't *much* holding them back. But *within* the laws of the church, if he *really* wants something to get done, his opponents have no recourse.",

If you already plan on abusing children, \"priest\" is the ultimate dream job.\n\nAnd where child abusers gather, pedophilia is of course going to be normalized. The Church has spent a long, long time fighting against healthy attitudes towards sexuality or any real sex education. There's a lot of social reasons for this, but one of the big ones is to keep their victims as vulnerable as possible, to prevent them from realizing what's happening to them until it's too late, to shame them into not speaking up. Another main purpose is, of course, to make themselves feel better about their behaviour. \n\nOf course, despite all the men who sought Holy Orders with the specific intention of using their congregation as an all-you-can-molest buffet, there are still presumably going to be *some* people who joined The Church for other reasons. Some percentage of those people are going to be \"marginal pedophiles\" - those who have some small predisposition towards attraction-to-minors, but who would never have acted on it, and likely never even become consciously aware of it, if they didn't spend years immersed in a culture that **glorifies and encourages** the rape of children. These people could have gone on to live a normal life with a totally healthy sexuality, if they hadn't made the mistake of joining an organization whose stated rule is \"You are never allowed to experiene sexual release ever again!\", and whose unwritten but institutionally accepted rule is \"...except by raping a child.\"\n\nThe existing child-abusers understand that it's in their best interests to recruit these new priests into their ranks. The more of them there are, the more they can help each other, and the more easily they can convince themselves that there's nothing wrong with that they're doing. Perhaps more importantly, in the (apparently very, very rare) instance that a priest might figure out that **raping children is bad**, the fact that he's *complicit* in the abuse ought to be enough to keep him silent.\n\ntl;dr: Powerful pedophiles protect the positions of their pals, pardon each other's perversions, and promote participation of potential pedophiles via peer pressure.",
