They are ignoring the killings, gang warfare and rapes caused by distributing Ak\u2019s  to dozens of civilians, criminals included, as well as ignored the push by NATO and the west to turn Ukraine into a buffer zone between them and Russia. Zelensky can fuck off. I don\u2019t wish harm upon any civilians but unfortunately, in war, thems the breaks. Casualties are impossible to completely avoid in a battlefield. And lastly, the globohomo, zeitgeist, elites are actively pushing for the support of Ukraine while limiting support and fervor for the Russians through their extremely selective media coverage. Focusing on \u201cmUh gHoSt oF kiEv\u201d, destroyed Russian columns, and civilian casualties to make it seem like the Ukrainians are winning while stoking sympathy from the global masses when I am certain they are getting pummeled by Igor and his men on the ground. I could see the brainwashing attempts from the very beginning and I had no intention of believing any of it. I don\u2019t like being told who to support and what to believe. I question everything. That\u2019s why I stand by Russia and cold indifference to the whole affair. Also, Judging by the lack of information regarding the secret meetings and back room deals that led us here (I assure that\u2019s how we ultimately got here) I can tell u there is even a chance the whole invasion is orchestrated. But should it be the real thing, I stand with Russia. If only for the chance of being on the side that\u2019s against the zeitgeist narrative. In this world of misinformation that we live in we need to question everything people. We have no choice but to. Question. Everything.",

We've all seen discussions and threads about how pointless those wars were, the crimes committed, the missiles killing water workers and children when it was otherwise claimed the casualties were just terrorists, the news that get reposted from 2016 about UN peacekeepers raping kids, and so on. \n\nHow about let's put our focus to what's happening right now, and that's Russia causing a war in Europe between 2 sovereign nations, killing people, bombing hospitals and shooting medics. The same Russia that commited a similar war in Georgia, the same Russia that brutalized Chechnya, the same Russia that committed war crimes in Syria and backed Assad, and the same Russia that's brandishing nuclear weapons and lashing out at the world for  \"forcing\" themselves to do this when instead Russia could pour its money into improving itself and the lives of its people.\n\nDoing this whataboutism is just wrong and purely serves Putin to divert effort from what's happening right now. Really just not the right time for it.",

But like morons, we decided to chop off our arm because we got an infection on our thumb.\n\nNot to mention, it was very interesting to see how the left completely abandoned the \u201cmy body, my choice\u201d mantra when it came to state mandated vaccinations. Let\u2019s face it, the only reason the left was ok with vaccine mandates is because their guy is in the White House, and thus they foolishly trust their authoritarian government overreach. If Trump was still president, holy fucking shit the left would have re-burned down their cities if the scary orange man wanted to force them to vaccinate.",

Can't go to hospitals to visit (only one that somewhat makes sense). \n\nEVERYONE couldn't go outside after 10pm and after 8pm for weeks on end. It was illegal to visit your friends for EVERYONE for a certain amount of time. It was illegal to have gatherings for EVERYONE for a certain amount of time.\n\nWhat I have left: Some jobs, internet at home, TV. \n\nWhat they tried to do: They tried to push for actual real forced vaccination and they tried to pass a law to fine all the unvaccinated. The prime minister has made efforts to get the population to dislike us asking \"can we tolerate these people\"\n\nThe military used their power to conduct psyops against the population and didn't notify the federal government. They took the covid pandemic as an opportunity to have some fun.\n\nSo yes, these are quite large in scale for a disease that has a net cost of 3 days per year per person wherein the 3 days lost are on average days lived past 80.\n\nThe vaccine has failed, 4 doses in one year, yet, people still contract covid. If every single person was vaccinated, covid would still spread because the vaccine does not work. The vaccine loses all ability to fight the current strain and turns in a negative protection after 4 months. The vaccine has a 1 in 200 chance of hospitalization increase (0,7 to 1,2). The vaccine and the lockdowns have had tremendous costs in terms of dollars and emotional health. The lockdowns have made people more fat, which will lead to a loss of life exceeding the 3 days per year loss that we've encountered.\n\nThe masks that are worn aren't the correct masks. It would've been easy to make everyone wear a p100 gas mask and call it a day, but it wasn't done. A mask which, i bought 10s of for my friends and family in January of 2020 when the pandemic started 2 years ago, out of precaution. Which ended up being unnecessary, but better safe than sorry.\n\nThe vaccine itself has little to no prevention of spread according to bill gates and official data alike. \n\nTherefore: \n\nA) The restrictions on the unvaccinated are really truly severe\n\nB) The restrictions on the unvaccinated have no impact and are not warranted\n\nYou have let go of all your rights and freedoms. You have been conned. If they can mandate the vaccine or make the living standards so awful that you have to, they can do so for lots of things. Such as gene therapy on new borns or forced organ donations or forced exercise (as it would divide hospitalization by 6 if within that group).\n\nLocation: Quebec",

The government made them do it.\n\n>Why would you want to work for a government you don't believe in?\n\nMoney. Like every other job. Not a relevant question.\n\n>Drive?\nI can't drive, usa doesnt allow unvaccinated people in. I'd need a boat, but I'm not sure that's legal either.\n\n>it's not currently happening? So why complain\n\nBecause if it can happen once, it can happen twice. If you had said this 5 months ago, you would've been greeted with the same situation 2 months ago! (initially happened 9 months ago for the first time)\n\n>Friends, family, parks, hiking, the outdoors, neighborhood gatherings, exercise, street music, gaming, pickup games of football/baseball/soccer/frisbee, learn a language, learn to go code, read a book.  \n \ni do friends and family, but at some point we werent allowed to. I'm not allowed to participate in sports with signups legally. I know how to code, i speak two languages, and i draw everyday. A personal attack for no reason, with no accuracy.\n\n>Only a chode would complain about stuff that *didn't* happen\n\nThey prep these things before having them happen. Just like we complained about the covid passport before it happened and you called us conspiracy theorists. NOTE: you were wrong.\n\n> 4 doses in one year\n\nIt's true in israel. 3 doses in one year for most other places.\n\n>That's not true, but you're stupid enough to believe whatever you want. The truth is unflinching.  \n \nit is true! After 4 months, the vaccine is at a negative impact, provides negative benefits ie you are MORE likely to get covid. This is the official danish data and was replicated in the uk as well.\n\n>This is untrue. I'm encouraging you to provide a source so I can laugh at you.  \n\nThis is from the largest study on the vaccine. The most rigorous one as well, done by pfizer. 1.2% vs 0.7% hospitalization rate placebo vs vaccine. \n\nsimplified but misleading wording: https://imgur.com/WQIoE5m\nsimplified but misleading wording: https://imgur.com/hVjkpH9\nData itself: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261159v1.full.pdf\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261159v1\n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa2110345/suppl_file/nejmoa2110345_appendix.pdf\n\n\nIt is true to state it went from 0,7 to 1,2 however. The vaccine is related to higher hospitalization incidences. If you go into the study protocol you will see that near-to-all SAEs are hospitalization or death.\n\n>So... you'll wear the proper medical masks but choose not to get vaccinated? Okay....\n \nWearing a p100 mask cost me money, but it was free and without health risks. I paid 1000$ in medical supplies in january while the media told you that masks don't work and that covid would never come here. My whole family and every friend had the tools to avoid covid at 100% by the month of february. I can give you a screenshot in dms! \n\nas the final contention, you seem to believe the vaccine reduces spread. Find an article within the last 3 months and provide me with the PERCENTAGE in reduction. I checked it like 6 months back and we were down to 20% reduction. So by now, it should be essentially nothing. The viral load in peoples noses is the same (actually a bit higher in the vaccinated but the confidence bar is wider so whatever its the same) between vaxx and unvaxx.",

Look at the quebec website.  \n  \n> https://www.quebec.ca/en/health/health-issues/a-z/2019-coronavirus/progress-of-the-covid-19-vaccination/covid-19-vaccination-passport/places-and-activities-requiring-covid-19-vaccination-passport  \n  \nIn that website you linked, it said that unvaccinated people **are** allowed to accompany women delivering a baby, which I don't recall if you mentioned, but that's pretty unnecessarily open of them. Additionally, while some events did require vaccines, it said that \"sports practised freely outdoors, including in facilities such as swimming pools, tennis courts and skating rinks\" did not require them, so it does seem you have a number of options.\n\n\n> It was not a free market decision. The government made them do it.  \n  \nIs that why some grocery stores require and some don't?  \n  \n>Why would you want to work for a government you don't believe in?  \n  \n> Money. Like every other job. Not a relevant question.  \n  \nSo get the vaccine? Lmao dumbass. Obviously those other people deserve those jobs more than you, you don't want it enough. I'm glad it went to those willing to take the bare minimum extra step to mitigate the risk of infecting others in a global pandemic. Leeches on the system like you always want something for nothing.  \n  \n> I can't drive   \n   \nYou were never going to be a functioning member of society anyway, I suggest getting the vaccine and hoping you get superpowers. That's your best shot.  \n  \n> Because if it can happen once, it can happen twice. If you had said this 5 months ago, you would've been greeted with the same situation 2 months ago! (initially happened 9 months ago for the first time)   \n   \nTake this advice from someone who still currently has a good job, you'll get a lot farther in life if you stop focusing on things that aren't even happening. You're complaining about dust and it looks like you're just whining.  \n  \n> It's true in israel. 3 doses in one year for most other places.   \n   \nSo it's not affecting you? I'm sensing a theme here. Additionally, and I wouldn't expect someone of you were intellectual capacity to understand this, but only two doses are required for full vaccination. The booster is optional. So when you say four you just look stupid. Whining, whining, whining.  \n  \n> as the final contention, you seem to believe the vaccine reduces spread.  \n  \nAre you really this r\u00e9t\u00e1rd\u00e9d? Jesus Christ, you are the reason your parents got divorced.  \n  \n> Find an article within the last 3 months and provide me with the PERCENTAGE in reduction. I checked it like 6 months back and we were down to 20% reduction. So by now, it should be essentially nothing. The viral load in peoples noses is the same (actually a bit higher in the vaccinated but the confidence bar is wider so whatever its the same) between vaxx and unvaxx.  \n  \n> mRNA vaccines reduce risk of infection by 91% for fully vaccinated (June 2021) https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0607-mrna-reduce-risks.html   \n  \n> further characterize reduced COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness against asymptomatic and mild symptomatic infections (Sep 2021) https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/fully-vaccinated-people.html   \n   \n> The mRNA vaccines were roughly 88 percent effective against hospitalizations in immunocompromised people who had received a third dose (Feb 2022) https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/27/world/omicron-covid-vaccine-tests  \n   \nYou're going to complain that the above information doesn't fit your specific criteria for percentage and time window and all of those other little goal posts, but literally every major medical professional on the planet has demonstrated the efficacy of the vaccine well beyond a reasonable doubt. You can continue to downplay the seriousness of the virus and you can continue to fail to recognize the efficacy of the vaccine, but neither of those things change the confirmed facts of the reality that you and I both live in. Maybe one of these days you'll get a decent paying job, but knowing the reputation of efficiency in government workers, I doubt it. Good luck, champ! The rest of us with jobs will keep looking out for you scum sucking leeches. Maybe you should consider getting a vaccine \"for money\" if that's all that really matters to you. Until then, you'll just keep complaining about a problem you create for yourself. Toodaloo.",

But it\u2019s not, and it never was. We knew the virus primarily affects old people, and even then, it has less than a 5% mortality rate among the elderly. So the answer was simple: Quarantine the elderly, let young and healthy people keep working and living their lives, they will most likely catch the virus, they will survive, and then the virus will start to mutate into less and less deadly variants (like we\u2019ve now seen with Omicron). Boom, pandemic over, and you didn\u2019t cause a global recession that will economically cripple billions of people for the next fifteen years.\n\nBut you fucking mouth breathers had to go ahead and fuck everything up, didn\u2019t ya?",

It is absolutely insane to suggest that the response to the pandemic will kill more people than the virus. Not to mention had the world done nothing in response to the pandemic, then there would have been far more deaths, which you unintentionally admitted in your previous post. I remember where your talking point came from. That research paper from those conservative economists, suggesting that lockdowns would kill more people that the actual virus. That same study that wasn't peer reviewed and made the rounds within the conservative media apparatus for you dipshits to consume and vomit into any rational conversation. Almost the entire rest of the public health and scientific community disagreed with it, and actual peer-reviewed studies have show that it wasn't true. I know none of this is going to convince you otherwise because you have a baby brain caused by conservatism, it's just really sad you people are incapable of changing your minds based on new factual information that doesn't line up with your worldview.",

I never said we should have done nothing in response to the pandemic, I said we should have quarantined the elderly, since they are overwhelmingly the demographic who is affected by the virus, and allowed for young healthy people to continue living their lives so that we could achieve herd immunity faster, which is what we ended up achieving anyways thanks to Omicron being about as deadly as a common cold. We would\u2019ve had a similar number of dead people, with the benefit of not destroying the global economy, not putting society on the road to authoritarianism, AND not setting race relations back 50 years. \n\nBut sure, dismiss these facts as \u201cconservative propaganda\u201d or whatever, baseless accusations are all that you have at this point, given that the policies people like you supported ended up being the wrong ones, the only other option would be for you to admit you were wrong. But unlike you, I actually understand how people work, and it\u2019d be easier to convince someone ideologically possessed to commit murder than to make them admit that they\u2019re wrong.

Aside from COVID deaths, the death rates between the experimental and control groups are effectively random.\n\nSo with that out of the way, there were 3 COVID deaths. I would agree that a difference of one is effectively nothing, but with such a low sample size any comparison between them borders on meaninglessness. You could flip a coin 4 times and determine it's 75% likely to land on heads.\n\nI'm not arguing any of the surrounding information, or how important COVID is, just talking about what's in this study in particular.

There is only a difference of 1 death between the 2 groups. This study failed to show either an increase or decrease in deaths, both from COVID and overall. I guess I never said in my previous reply but yes you were right, the study did not show a reduction in deaths -- I'm saying I don't think it showed much at all about deaths.\n\nThe reason I said before I wasn't interested in total deaths was just because I was discussing efficacy against COVID and not safety.\n\nI said earlier I was only here to talk about the study, but:\n\n> Any further vaccine that isn't 100% effective will simply create selective pressure to create a new strain or favor a strain that can escape the specific protection that the vaccine confers.\n\nYes, this is something I've been concerned about for a while.

Neither are directly related to this specific conflict, but speak to a bigger archetype.\n\n1) it's difficult for some people to believe that some folks are just unempathetic assholes. So when an unempathetic asshole does asshole things, these people do their best to make to make sense. In this instance, if Putin is saying there are Nazis in the Ukrainian government that he's trying to cleanse, that must be true otherwise why would he do this? There's got to be a good reason Putin is invading or there must be a good reason why those rednecks in Georgia killed that black jogger. It can't be that they just did something objectively wrong. So any excuse is seen with more credibility than it deserves. \n\n2) Some people are so convinced that they're constantly being fed bullshit (not completely unfair) that they just automatically snap to the opposite of the mainstream opinion. If your perspective is that the media has an agenda for every piece of content they put out and it's in conjunction with the Democratic party of the US (or vice versa with Fox News abdyrhe Republicans) then whatever CNN is saying, the opposite must be true. Biden and MSNBC are both saying that Putin is having his military target civilian targets? Well that's obviously not true because CNN and Biden are always lying. You saw it on the other side too. For 4 years anything Trump and/or Fox News said, there were people who would reject it immediately without any inspection.\n\n\nI think there are very few people who support Putin for what his true reasons are. That is (imo), that he feels that his legacy is to restart the Soviet Union and restore balance between Eastern and Western expansion.",

Where power and justice are back where they belong: in the hands of the people! Where every man is free to think - to act - for himself! Fuck all these limp-dick lawyers and chickenshit bureaucrats. Fuck this 24-hour Internet spew of trivia and celebrity bullshit! Fuck American pride! Fuck the media! FUCK ALL OF IT! America is diseased. Rotten to the core. There's no saving it - we need to pull it out by the roots. Wipe the slate clean. BURN IT DOWN! And from the ashes, a new America will be born. Evolved, but untamed! The weak will be purged and the strongest will thrive - free to live as they see fit, they'll make America great again!... In my new America, people will die and kill for what they BELIEVE! Not for money. not for oil! Not for what they're told is right. Every man will be free to fight his own wars! \"",

Which is why Russia mobilized it's military to the border, to scare the Ukraine govt into arresting the neo Nazis. They did some but it was just show, they didn't touch any of their leaders. Remember the prisoners zelensky was gonna release today? Likely alot of these guys.

There has been a civil war going on since 2014 and these people wanted to break free from Ukraine. I don't think Russia is a great country and I don't think Putin is a good person at all but I don't care to suck the dick of some comedian turned president who takes a lot of photos next to soldiers. This guy took a civilian militia full of neo-nazis and made them official soldiers with their own battalion. This guy couldn't please the people of Donetsk and Luhansk so he sent mortars and Armored Vehicles there for years. All these sanctions against Russia and boycotting Russian products just hurts the economy and the people of Russia. I also doubt most people could point at Ukraine on a map but now bc big scary Russia is liberating the people from literal neo-nazis, now everyone is upset and butthurt.",

Especially US diplomats and strategists ignored that and helped create the environment, where this invasion got possible.\n\nPutin (as well as USA and China) understands international politics in a strictly (neo-) realistic way and therefore factors like powerprojection and deterrence are still the main factors to the balance of power.\n\nEveryone knew that and yet everyone tried to get Ukraine into NATO and kept isolating Russia or trying to neuter its most important (military) assets.\n\nThis is a failure of western diplomacy and strategy.\n\nFor Russia, this war makes 100% sense strategically.\n\nDo I condone it or does it make sense morally? OF COURSE NOT\n\nBut you people act like the neurotic kids you probably are. If you paid attention, you would've known that at some point this situation needed to escalate.\n\nJust no one thought it would be right now.",

Unless you want to claim an entire revolution in the nation was CIA funded. Which there doesn't seem to be much if any evidence of. Politicans expressed encouragement to ukraine through political grandstanding primarily. Meanwhile, Putin has been holding a grudge ever since despite their independence threatening russia in no real way. \n\nIt's also interesting to note the true point where the people confirmed Russian control of their government... when it was discovered russian troops mixed in with ukrainian authorities during a extremely violent attack on the protestors.\n\nhttps://tyzhden.ua/News/102493",

If the ukraine is under russia's control their first defensive line moves farther to the west that is a way more defensible line than having belarus surrounded. And russia sees NATO as a possible future threat. The ukraine is also economically very important for russia. They have way very big and mostly unused reserves of oil and gas. Putin already stopped them letting western companies extract these ressources and they themselves don't have the means to extract them. Russia's economy heavily relies on its oil and gas exports. If I'm not mistaken it makes up about 50% of their GDP. If a west-aligned ukraine starts selling to other european countries (their biggest buyers) it would cripple russia's economy. These are not justifications of putin's actions but it is important to understand the reasoning behind it. Putin isn't merely acting out of spite. He is too power hungry for that.",

Our foreign policy is built on the assumption that our geopolitical adversaries are crazy or have unwittingly evil with some sort of grand strategy . This is falsifiable in many ways:\r\n\n* the historical record shows these 2 assumptions are rarely true\r\n* If we assume that individuals themselves are generally rational, then organizations will tend to move in a way that helps individuals and groups seek personal gain rather than in a long term cohesive direction (which we all understand is true in terms of domestic policy and pretend is not true in terms of foreign policy). For example, there is no grand strategy in terms of how we allocate the budget, its based on competing interests\r\n* If we assume individuals are irrational as well, it would be a cosmic joke of a coincidence that individual irrationality would cancel out so that our foreign policy sphere is rational\r  \n\n\n  \n3. \"Sanction them hard enough and the regime will collapse\" has failed in Iraq, Syria, Iran, Cuba, North Korea, etc. Russia is much more powerful than any of those  countries. Why would it work here? Most likely scenario is increasing escalation until victory or negotiated settlement. In fact, for everyone who actually cares about \"saving ukrainian lives\" now that we've thrown the kitchen sink at them & they've sustained higher casualties / made slower progress than expected incentivizes them to speed things up by lowering their threshold on civilian casualties. \r  \n\r  \n4. America needs to learn to survive in a multipolar landscape sooner rather than later. This means picking your battles and respecting other country\u2019s spheres of influence. This rslured pax americana world police stuff has got to go.\r  \n\r  \n5. Supporting GAE is gay",

Nope, pro Russian TV stations were shut down.\n\n2 - try to back Russia friendly candidates.... Nope, opposition leaders were jailed.\n\n3- invade.... Welp. Here we are.",

He literally grew up around adults who had survived a 2 year siege by Nazis where a million Russian civilians died from either starvation or gunfire. He then spent his career as a KGB officer which I don\u2019t think is good for decreasing paranoia.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right, but do you think a guy who lived the life Putin has is going to just watch Europe consolidating into a massive super economy as well as NATO growing without thinking he needs to stop it? \n\nThere were devastating attacks launched against Russia from a consolidated Europe in 1812 and 1940. The only thing that preserved the Russian State in both cases was the hundreds of miles between Moscow and Central Europe. I don\u2019t think Putin\u2019s actions are justified, but I can 100% see how his paranoia took shape between his personal history and Russian history as a whole.",

Whether there is NATO or no NATO, some countries will just think they have more to gain with the west than with Russia. Is the West supposed to turn those countries away from doing business with the West cause they\u2019re former Soviet satellites? Was the West supposed to just watch the USSR collapse in on itself and pretend that it was still there for the purposes of dealing with sovereign states that want to get closer to the West? I think maybe they could have done this better, but if NATO was dissolved, it\u2019s very likely we\u2019re having the same conversation, but sub in something like \u201cEU defense pact\u201d for NATO. \n\nThe fact is, the world has changed a lot since 1940. Russia\u2019s road back to being a major power with domestic security was through modernizing its economy and leveraging its strategic position.

Since joining the western bloc and it\u2019s philosophy they\u2019ve basically become vassal states that sold out significant parts of their industry and natural resources for political favours from the EU. It is however true that they enjoy a better life for now, big emphasis on FOR NOW. Most eastern european countries face a devastating demographic collapse due to massive emmigration into the richer countries to the west. You think that picking up the neoliberal way of life is strictly better and it was a no-brain choice for them in the 1990\u2019s - maybe, but it also could\u2019ve been because it was something different and the ONLY choice. Unless you come from the future and tell us how it\u2019s all going to turn out, we haven\u2019t run the neoliberal society simulation long enough to see if it\u2019s going to be more disastrous than even the communist regime. The way I see it, there\u2019s potential for massive conflict and chaos in the west purely because of the developing racial tensions, not even mentioning collapsing demographics, nihilist consumerist zeitgeist, cronyism that keeps on growing the wealth inequality etc. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.",

Both countries have reasons to either fight or negotiate, they both chose to fight, that's just how the world works sometimes.\n\nBut all of the war news out of the Ukrainian side has been an outright lie.  I can't cheer for the side whose claiming that they destroy the entirety of the other side's army every day when the reality is the opposite.  Its why Baghdad Bob was so funny back in the day - he turned himself into a joke and Ukraine has done the same thing here.\n\nAlso, for all the shit that France got for giving up in WWII, doing so saved the country from being destroyed.  They, and every other western European country that Germany invaded, made the deliberate choice to avoid fighting in the cities and, as a result, those countries came out of WWII intact.  This contrasts with Eastern Europe, which was decimated to the point that there is still a giant gap in the standard of living between it and Western Europe 80 years later.\n\nUkraine is making that same choice now that it and Eastern Europe made back then.  Even if they win, they're going to completely destroy their country to do so.  Its sad.  I feel bad for the people who live there but no amount of Avenger memes or twitter posts about fake military victories is going to improve things for them.  Better leadership, which was able to resolve this before it turned into a war, was the optimal solution for them.  But now that its too late for that, the best that they can hope for is a quick Russian victory that spares the important parts of the major cities.",

Russia still has not taken out Ukraine command and control centers.\n\n2. Russia still does not have air superiority.\n\n3. Russia has done no airdrops since the second day of the war; as they have all failed. They have even reportedly lost Hostomel (or at least the place where they did their photo op of raising the Russian flag; as there is a newer video showing the raising of the Ukrainian flag).\n\n4. After 5 days of fighting, Russia has lost more troops and armour than the US did in its entire war with Iraq. Which was on the other side of the planet.\n\n5. With all of that said, Ukraine is less than 300km from Moscow. This is literally their backyard, and they can't even cripple Ukraine's defences.\n\nIn comparison to Iraq, America was able to achieve most of these things within the first 12 hours of the war. Iraq being on the other side of the planet...\n\n> The Russians could turn Kharkiv into a crater with their artillery tomorrow, yet they are refusing to engage in area bombing in order to spare civilians. They are being precise, patient and methodical.\n\nThey are already:\n\n/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/t3fkld/kharkiv_ukraine_my_street_is_being_bombarded_by/\n\nThis is cluster munitions on civilian population centers. Video evidence of it, and it's Kharkiv, a city still controlled by Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally you should see the number of burnt out russian logistics columns:\n\n/CombatFootage/comments/t26kdl/destroyed_russian_column_on_the_outskirts_of/\n\n/CombatFootage/comments/t3ga4h/a_pretty_long_column_of_destroyed_and_abandoned/\n\n/CombatFootage/comments/t1szsv/destroyed_russian_convoy_in_kherson_allagedly/\n\n/CombatFootage/comments/t2uak7/next_footage_from_tonights_fights_between_uaf_and/\n\nP.S. You can tell they are Russian vehicles because the ones that aren't obliterated have one of the letters Z V or O painted on them which indicates the direction they are coming from and moving to.\n\n> The speed with which the Russian forces are taking territory is unprecedented.\n\nThis is literally on their doorstep, and they cant even take 1 major city nor knock out Ukrainian command and control centers nor gain air supremecy.\n\nUkrainians were still flying jets just yesterday. That alone is crazy.\n\nP.P.S. had to remove the beginning of my links because this sub doesnt allow linking to other subs so just add https://np.reddit.com/r",

We have to keep in mind that what follows is not his opinion, but rather the opinions he saw on those threads.\n\n>like it\u2019s the Jews or how Zelensky is actually a Nazi or something\n\nSo in this portion of the comment, OP is explaining how two prevailing opinions he saw on some of 4chan threads he saw were \"it's the Jews\" or \"how Zelensky is actually a Nazi or something\". So OP does not neccessarily hold these opinions, but rather saw them when browsing 4chan.\n\nAlthough these two opinions might seem contradictory, if you look closely at the sentence, the conjunction used is \"or\", which demonstrates that OP intended to show these opinions as independent from each other.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any other comments on this thread that are confusing to you. I'd be happy to help explain them.",
