Why does this style of oneupmanship matter to so many people?\n\nIn fact, it's not mental illness (lol?). Homosexuality is completely normal, and repression, while tragic and incurring enormous emotional scarring, is at least understandable given the environment and indoctrination that people like Peterson experience throughout their lives.\n\nImagine if you grew a sixth finger on your left hand. And your society, or at least your social circle, believed that people with six fingers on their left hand were literally demonic. You have the choice to try to cut that finger off and live a mostly normal life among the five fingers, or you can try to hide it until you can't anymore, or you can try to escape. Alternatively you could kill yourself because you have no where to go and can't live with the hate around you day in day out reminding you that you're abnormal, which sadly is what far too many six-fingered kids decide to do.\n\nHaving six fingers is completely normal, is not demonic, and such thoughts have no place in modern society. But you will suffer the scars of the ignorant and hateful people around you, and you're not going to make a decision on how to deal with that pain. People like Peterson decide to hide their differences in plain sight doing exactly what he was taught to do as a child, which is to loudly and proudly preach how demonic and wrong six fingered people are.\n\nIt's not mental illness, it's a defense mechanism. It's a horrible one that causes more pain and more suffering and more indignation. But we can understand the mechanism even as we condemn the hypocrisy. And in this understanding we can hopefully open the eyes of others like Peterson suffering as he has his entire life.",

They said the common tactic of the alt right and fascists to project themselves on to the opposition is. When a right wing fascist says \"Democrats have an underground child sex dungeon\" then we can be pretty damn sure that they themselves have an underground child sex dungeon. That is strait out of the fascist manual. It's a common tactic, and the person you replied to was colloquially saying \"that's retarded\".",

But in many ways I pity him because I'm well aware he's like this because he's been indoctrinated into believing everything he is saying instead of being allowed to accept himself. \n\nI don't view people like him with disgust and revulsion because I can understand exactly the parts of the society built by cis straight men have led to the way he views himself and others. \n\nThis kind of indoctrination is hard to overcome for many. See how religion has taken hold of so many...\n\nAlso using \"that's retarded\" or \"it's mental illness\" is much like saying \"that's gay\" as a pejorative term.

If anything it may have gotten worse since there seems to be more and more of these religious conservatives who are caught being predators who prey on children themselves besides all the accusations they throw at the LGBT community.",

It doesn't mean it's ok, it just means we might handle them differently.\nI say this whenever I have to explain to my trans son why grampa is such a dick. Grampa has a TBI and has damage to his frontal and parietal lobes. Makes it almost impossible to filter his speech so that he is not hurtful. For example, he might feel that my kid's artwork is a little abstract for his understanding and instead of saying, \"I'm not sure I understand this, will you explain it for me?\" He might say, \"Wow did you spill the paint?\" He's not trying to be mean, his immediate thought comes right out his mouth. My kids know this by now and just explain things at the outset. This way he understands what they're doing and it interrupts his stream of consciousness speech so he's not a dick when it's his turn to talk. He will learn what their artwork means and praise them when he understands.\nIt does NOT, however, make it impossible to not be a bigot in the first place. He is demonstrably capable of learning new things and changing his mind.\nIt just means we know he's a bigot and is guaranteed to be outspoken about it if we don't take steps to interrupt him.\nReasons, not excuses. \nHe speaks his exact thoughts because he has little control over it and sometimes is unable to control things like anxiety and paranoia. He is incapable of being diplomatic if he is not given something else to focus on. We have ways of helping him to not be a douchebag.\nBut if we miss and he acts like a douchebag, he isn't let off the hook. It just changes how we burn his ass for it afterwards.",

Religion, politics, and even sports or gaming to an extent have the ability to bring about some of the worst of humanity. What they all have in common is tribalism. Us vs Them. Not everyone is so wrapped up in these things that it negatively affects their lives. Maybe not even most. But for many people it can. \n\nPeople like to feel like they belong. It's why they join groups. Generally made up of like-minded people. These groups create an echo-chamber for themselves and make themselves believe that anybody not on their side is the Devil, Nazis/Commies, bad people, etc. People in these groups are willing to stretch the truth, use hyperbole, or even outright fabricate things to prove their opponents wrong. Even knowing what they are doing, they will feel themselves justified. Because \"fuck those people over there! They think (insert opposing belief)!\" \"They must be stupid/brainwashed/evil/etc!\"\n\nTake this subreddit for example. It doesn't even make sense to have a forum based on the idea that we don't believe something. This sub is full of edgelord teens who are pissed off at all Christians for something the minority are responsible for. I've seen some pretty fucked up shit in this sub over the years. I'm an atheist too, but I'm not gonna hate someone for believing something that I don't. Don't none of us know shit, especially whether there is a God or not. The logical position is to just say you don't know. Because we don't. None of us do. So here we are, a group of people that don't know something who are violently opposed to another group of people that also don't know something, except they think they do. Not because they are dumb or hateful, but for a variety of reasons likely out of their control. It could have been any one of us. Smart people are not immune to being misled by religion and someone who is an atheist isn't automatically intelligent. But most people in here think they are. And as a result feel superior to anyone who isn't part of their group. \n\nI mean, I've been guilty of the same shit, but I'm not gonna pretend I haven't. We're still just a bunch of violent apes. Always have been.",

Like I understand that most, if not all are born that way, but why should that even matter? Outside of explicitly religious dogmatism, why should it matter if someone chooses to be gay or not? Why is that not a valid lifestyle 'choice' people should be allowed to make in the first place?\n\nCeding the argument towards being an innate trait, something people are born as.. IMO opens up the gateway towards people wanting to prove a biological disposition, or a 'gay' gene or whatever, and to me that has way scarier implications. If it was proven that homosexuality had genetic markers, then the worst anti-gay crusaders could actively seek out those people with those markers for active oppression or genocide. If 23andMe could flag people who were gay, the wrong people in control of government having access to that data is about as worst case a scenario as you could get. \n\nJust let people live however they want as long as they're not hurting anyone else. Whether or not certain lifestyles are a choice or not shouldn't matter, let people choose.",

This happens so often that when religious / political people scream about how disgusting sex is or homosexuals or they start calling everyone they disagree with a pedophile, people actually start taking bets over their downfall. \n\nUsually within a few months or years, the person is found out to have children outside of marriage, homosexual relationships or they participated in some form of non-consensual / statutory rape. It happens so often, people predict it, with no real knowledge of the person, and it comes true. It isn't a bug, it's a feature. It seems to be their default position and their phony 'disgust about all things sexual' is by design. \n\nBy talking about how 'disgusting' it is, this allows them to speak publicly about it and thus attract others with similar interests while simultaneously currying favor with the 'high moral standards' crowd.  In the end, it is just more of the same old religious hypocrisy that we have seen day after day, year after year for literally thousands of years. It's just more of the same old \u201cRules for thee but not for me\u201d.",
