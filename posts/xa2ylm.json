Since the emergence of cities and a ruling class, though, faith has only been a tool for rulers to subjugate the masses.",

A phenomenon that can be explained reasonably if the individual is patient and persistent and continues to seek truth, in themselves and, more importantly, in more than one book, and not accept if locals acknowledge it, nor whatever the locals happen to call it presently",

The founding fathers were deists if Im not mistaken. Also the confederacy were also christians and they had slavery as reason for sedition in their documentation (excempt one which implicit in rather explicitly wrote it) \n\nApart from that the Haitian revolution prior 1800 abolished slavery in Haiti (for a while edit; as I looked it up, stayed unslaved) and they believed in parts of Voodoo and used those believes to instill fear in christians even though I couldnt get numbers, you know, prior 1800 and a slave rebellion is understandable.\n-> point, just because one religious group did a good thing doesnt mean its *because* of that religion. Christianity was also used to *justify* slavery until the civil war and even after. \n\nBy the same accord you could say \"why didnt african tribes put up a better fight when christianity colonized them with canons and converted them?\"\n\n\nThere are sects of christians, like mormons, that believe horrible stuff. *Some* sects are less vile than others. The cathlic church in america, as my perception from outside, seems to be the least problematic in their doctrins.\n\n\nTo be clear. Im not arguing against believers, I argue against the concept of being a \"good human\" by believing in a book thats filled with vile stuff and not questioning *everything* in there. If you come to the conclusion that you like certain things are necessary to be a good human, thats a thing I can get behind. \n\nWhat I cant get behind us this \"homosexuality is evil because its written in this chapter that a man lying with a male child is bad\" for example.",

See my position on education above. \n\nBut I grant you: out of the thousands of years the church existing in slave-keeping nations there will be instances were people tried to stop it. But in the end, the people ending the slave trade were not doing so because of religion. They were doing so because of education that every human shall be free. \n\nThe confederate bloody states still used agruments from the church for their pro slave stances when they got upset they had to end slavery and seceded. \n\n>So the world's largtest church? One that sticks rigidly to traditional Christianity? That more than half of the world's Christians belong to? What is wrong with the other major churches: Anglican, Orhodox, etc.\n\nI go from perception not studies on this one. Murica has Mormons for example that have huuge problems with human ethics. The worlds largest church isnt percieved equaly in every country mind you. You might be surprised. \n\n>Are Mormons Christians? They are not recognised as such by most Christians. Their doctrines are signifcantly different.\n\nYes they are. By the same argument a protestant isnt a christian to a cathlic and a hindu is an atheist to a religion that doesnt allow another god next to them (because hindu gods wouldnt exist). From an outside view Mormons are part of the christian bubble. \n\n>I think you are making the same mistake as biblical literalists: interpreting a collection of documents as a single book, without taking cultural context and language into account.\n\nI dont give a fack about the cultural context. Culture changes. So it cant hold value over time in different cultures. \nI started this threat (if I remember correctly) on the point that the bibles best interpretation would be one to question every single sentence as possible deception and come to your own view on whats good or bad. So I think we are not that far of each other here.\n\n>do not know much about American history, but I think you are right, and that means the people who wrote a constitution that allowed slavery were not Christians.\n\nFair. The people taking over a land from the biggest slave trading empire on earth was christian though. The thing I believe was the biggest factor in ending slavery was *the enlightenment*.\n\nBut Im not an expert on america either. I only learned in school how parts of germany had a synonym for slavery until 1899 and ended it in 1900. Also christian nation. \n\nDamn. I have to learn to keep it short. Way to much.\n\nEdit: but quick addition. I dont blame the founding fathers (old and rich man) for not ending a system they were born in that they didnt get rid of it the second they had the chance to. They *kept* a system already established. Abe Lincoln also was no christian. He believed in a god though. But I might be corrected as this *well educated* person might also be in the christian bubbly and I simply dont know.",

Didnt seem to last long in the isles that were pretty christian afterwards and a huuuuuge part in the slave trades of chattle slavery.\n\nI am not sure about Ireland, but in England slavery was abolished by the Normans (with the active support of the Church). While British traders took part in slavery it was not legal in England from then on.\n\n> If I look at 1500 I see the King doing this. Not the church. People. Not faith. See my position on education above.\n\nKings and parliaments make laws. In the late Roman Empire and its successor states Christian morality first to lead to far better treatment for slaves (they could no longer be raped with impunity, gladiatorial combat was ended, etc.) and then its reduction to serfdom (which meant they could not be bought and sold, they could marry, their children could not be taken away, etc.).\n\n> Yes they are. By the same argument a protestant isnt a christian to a cathlic and a hindu is an atheist to a religion that doesnt allow another god next to them\n\nBut Catholics do regard Protestants as Christians, and do not regard Hindus as atheists. As most Hindus are pantheists saying gos in the plural is not entirely accurate. On the other hand the Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox churches do not regard Mormons as Christian - which is why they do not recognise Mormon baptisms, for example. Mormons do not meet some reasonable definitions of Christianity because they are neither monotheistic nor Trinitarian. They regard themselves as Christians, but anyone can. Positive Christianity claimed to be purified Christianity while saying Jesus was not the Messiah. What about Christian Science?\n\n> The confederate bloody states still used agruments from the church for their pro slave stances when they got upset they had to end slavery and seceded.\n\nThat is because they were trying to convince a Christian society.  Many slave owners tried to prevent their slaves converting to Christianity because of the fear they would then regard themselves as equals. The British East Indian company opposed Christian missionaries in India because it would give low castes the same idea.\n\n> But in the end, the people ending the slave trade were not doing so because of religion\n\nSo they were lying about their motives?\n\n> I dont give a fack about the cultural context\n\nYou cannot understand a work from a different culture without understanding the context of the culture and the work. See below.\n\n> So I think we are not that far of each other here.\n\nYes, and no. We agree it needs interpretation, but my focus is on language, culture, and intent. For example St Paul's comments in one of the epistles are taken by some people as an endorsement of slavery. The epistles were addressed to particular people, and a more accurate interpretation is \"live the best you can as a slave, do not run away, and do not start a slave rebellion\". Given how the Romans treated runaway slaves and rebels that is good advice.\n\nJesus also said of some (not the ones about slavery as far as I know) that old testament laws were made as they were because the people would not follow the stricter laws he gave them.\n\nThe problem with using your idea of good and bad is that it is a product of a particular culture. It was why people accepted slavery for so long - because they thought it was inevitable.\n\n> The thing I believe was the biggest factor in ending slavery was the enlightenment.\n\nI believe quite the opposite. The enlightenment created modern racism (and later racial science), which as the justification for the revival of slavery. Some quotes from enlightenment thinkers:\n\nVoltaire:\n\n\"And it is a big question whether among them they are descendants of monkeys, or if monkeys come from them. Our wise men have said that man is the image of God: behold a pleasant image of the eternal Being with a flat black nose, with little or no intelligence!\"\n\nHume:\n\n\"I am apt to suspect the Negroes, and in general all other species of men, to be naturally inferior to the whites.\"\n\nKant:\n\n\"The Negroes of Africa have not received any intelligence from Nature that rises above foolishness. Mr. Hume challenges anyone to suggest even one example of a negro who has displayed any talent.\"\n\nVoltaire mocks Christianity for not being racist.\n\n> So did other religions for religious motives. \n\nSometimes, but it was a rarity and isolated, whereas it was a recurring issue for Christians. Christianity was a major motive in the abolition of slavery. Christian theology (that all human beings are made in the image of God) motivated the medieval declines and abolitions of slavery, and most of the major figures in the modern abolition of slavery were Christians and had explicitly religious motives.\n\n>  just because one religious group did a good thing doesnt mean its because of that religion\n\nMy point is that they had explicitly religious motives for doing so.

Every word of a book that has contradicting standpoints on the same subject can lead to any outcome if followed like, well, scripture tonuse the common saying.\n\nI like when some christians used faith to make the world better but I simply cant attribute that to a religion that has a text that allowes for everything if you \"believe\". Its okay to kill your son if god asks you to. Its \"okay\" to be homophobic because there is a phrase about pedophilia between two males.\n\nMaybe I used to many words. Question your faith. Dont fall into a believe because someone told you its gods will. It might be the one below in disguese (to use a religious motive). Wether you are mormon, Hindu, buddhist or anything else. You are responsible for your actions on this world. \n\nHope that clears that up somehow.",

Keep it mind Muhammad (pbuh) was illiterate and had no formal education.\n\n\u201cThere is an elegant description of origin, development and step by step developmental stages of intra-uterine life in Quraan. Muslims had this knowledge in 7th century and the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s Ahadeeth (sayings, deeds, approvals narrated by authentic narrators) had explained almost everything about natal and even postnatal events. These findings once presented to experts in the field of Anatomy and Embryology surprised them and they believed that the knowledge given to the Prophet Muhammad was indeed divine. \u201c\n\n\u201cModern embryology is a fairly recent development which has its beginning with the invention of microscope in the 17th century. However the concept of the human being developing in stages was not recognised until much later.\u201d\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3068791/",

If anyone is more knowledgeable, please ignore me and look to them as I could be waaaaaaaaaaaay off haha\n\nIt's important to understand the depth of what the Speed of Light (in a vacuum) represents. It is basically the cosmic speed limit; nothing in all of reality can travel faster than it, as it would need infinite energy. But what is 'everything' here? It's not just you or me, or a particle, or a wave, but time and causality and existence itself.\n\nSo if the Speed of Light were to change, or has changed throughout history (and thus *could* change), that would break down everything we think we know to the most fundamental of levels. Energy, mass, gravity, reality, causality, dimensions. Fun stuff. If the Speed of Light, and therefore the Speed of Causality were to have changed overtime, we would have overlapping causal occurrences catching up to each other, even passing each other. I can't even fathom how that would work\n\nEdit: Oh! This would also completely change how electromagnetism would have worked in the early universe and vastly change how our estimations and ideas about the universe shaping. Our definition and calculation of electromagnetic force is rooted in the speed of light. And light is, itself, a form of electromagnetic radiation\n\nAnd this is me talking even further outside of my wheelhouse to an embarrassing extent, but I think I've read something about how in Quantum mechanics it's believed that all matter exists as a wave-function (collapse?) operating at the speed of light. So if the speed of light were to change, the existence of matter would be fundamentally altered as well\n\nI welcome the dunks and telling me how stupidly wrong I am.

Nothing can move faster than the speed of light in a vacuum in a simple, local, way. However since some things do not \"move\" spacial in the same way in a detectable manner, and therefore are considered separate than a \"speed\" in this context\n\nSimilarly how if we could traverse through a wormhole and cross great distances instantly, this would be akin to traversing a fold in spacetime, rather than actually going faster than light\n\nAt least that's my understanding of this brain melting stuff",

The local speed of light is unchanged, it is simply its path that is altered, giving it a perception of slowing in a non-inertial reference frame. Calculations in a General Relativity framework assume spacetime is flat, and black holes are the greatest counter example to that in existence (that I know of). Special Relativity is where these curvatures of spacetime and reference frames are accounted for but frankly they're way over my head\n\n\nAnd discussions of what happened before the Big Bang are purely speculative, as far as I'm aware. We can talk any number of possibilities, but in the end we simply don't know. We can only postulate on what we can observe, not just hypotheticals. Sure, perhaps a god could change these things, but that's pretty inconsistent in what we see and measure, no? If not then maybe you've got the next revolutionary discovery on your hands",

Honestly if you want to stick a god in somewhere, I think that's the best place to do it. There are then still a ton of questions you'll have to answer about \"God caused the Big Bang\", though.\n\nOur current models of physics currently can't explain exactly what happened in the earliest stages of the Big Bang, either (namely the Planck Epoch). There is currently work being done on a quantum gravity model that might end up explaining it. Could the speed of light have been different during the Planck Epoch (the first 10^\u221243 second)? I guess. I haven't heard of any experts that believe that's the case but I'm not sure if there's convincing evidence it was not. It's almost certainly been constant since then, though.\n\nEither way, special relativity does cover what happens with regard to the speed of light with regard to large gravitational masses (i.e. a black hole). It's still constant in a vacuum within a given reference frame. c is a constant in our best physical model of the universe, and everything would completely break down if it weren't.",

Tell them that the speed of light is relative, i.e. the speed is different depending on your reference frame. It will help their argument!

Science is a method for demonstrating consistency in results; but it doesn't guarantee that the conclusions are correct, or that there isn't some unknown factor involved.\n\n\"Proofs\" are really just logical constructs, and given the appropriate premises, you can literally prove whatever you want, which is why there's so much contention about what's actually true.\n\nFor me, the relevant question is:  Does it matter?  For instance, I'm not sure my life would change very much if it were revealed that the moon landing was actually a hoax, or that the world is actually flat.  I mean, my understanding of reality would change, but I'd probably still pretty much just go about my day.",

But even if we pretend that this was the only possible way, which it isn\u2019t, how half-lives work there would still be a small fraction of the uranium that would have decayed in 4000 years, same goes for the subsequent decay processes, and lead would still exist, though it would be vastly more rare than uranium in that scenario.",

Once the theory is proven, you can then use it to draw useful conclusions. For example, the theory of gravity (Newtonian physics or however you want to refer to it) helped explain the gravitational pull of objects on earth among with the gravitational relationships with celestial bodies. Once scientists began to observe supermassive objects such as black holes, they saw Newtonian physics fail to explain their observations. When Einstein developed the theory of relativity it explained those discrepancies. It isn\u2019t that scientists decided gravity no longer existed. It\u2019s that additional data was needed, and is easily provable with the thousands of new discoveries that were made by researchers applying the new theory to their work.",

And anyway the whole peer review system is just that, part of the corrupt evil system.\n\n> This other conspiracy theory didn't come true\n\nThat conspiracy theory was wrong for some reason, or maybe just hasn't happened YET (see QAnon's constantly shifting goalposts).

Setup a telescope looking out to sea. Watch       the ships leave the harbor. Follow them out to sea. At a certain point, their wake disappears below the horizon. Then the horizon rises up the side of the ship. The deck disappears,then the superstructure vanishes. The ship falls off the face of the earth. Now, remember the size of the image as the wake disappeared. Take your telescope up 50 floors or more. Watch a similar size ship until it's wake vanishes. Were the images just as the wake vanishes the same size? If not, this disproves Flat Earth. They can't claim someone faked the experiment. The Catholic Church told Columbus they agreed with him that the world was round, they just didn't want to admit it to the faithful for fear the faithful would turn on them.",

Each time a function is called, it creates a new stack frame, which uses a little more memory.\n\nNormally that memory is freed when the function ends, but if you use recursion to implement an infinite loop then the function will call itself instead of ending, and the program will crash after just a few iterations with a \"stack overflow\" error.\n\nTail-call optimization can prevent this by making the recursive function reuse the same stack frame, but only a handful of languages support it at all, and a fraction of those guarantee it in their specification.",

He lived from about 35 AD to 107 AD and is rumored to have been a disciple of the Apostle John.\n\nI'm by no means trying to be argumentative, I'm just some history nerd on the internet, but I encourage everyone to do their *own* research and come to conclusions that can be demonstrated from reliable historical fact, and to consult sources without any sort of religious agenda.\n\nI tend to prefer translations that come out of secular academia due to lack of theological bias in translating.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about the topic I can *highly* recommend the [New Oxford Annotated Bible](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_Annotated_Bible). The editors adhere to the latest contemporary, scholarly views of Biblical criticism.\n\nPlease don't take anything I said as fact just because this random dude (me) on Reddit said so, hit up your local public library or friendly university and inquire for yourself. \n\nThere are also lots of wonderful free university courses on this topic available online, [like this one from Harvard](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/christianity-through-its-scriptures?delta=1).\n\nHave a great day!",

And all his teachings revolved around things like kindness, compassion, empathy, love, etc. So guys like Ham clearly don't read those parts and just spend their time trying to force fit this idiotic position about how young everything is.\n\nBesides, who is the more powerful Creator? One that sat patiently for billions upon billions of years, or the one that had to make everything appear as though it had but didn't. And who is the better believer? One who takes an uncritical look at the Bible, or the one who tries to understand it as a deep and complex philosophy that's meant to be meditated on for one's whole lifetime? Fuck Ken Ham.

Anyways, there is only one primordial lead isotope (Pb-204) not produced through radioactive decay chains. There three other stable lead isotopes (Pb-206, Pb-207, Pb-208) which have relative fractions that will be constant everywhere. Therefore, if there are any excess amount of the three isotopes I just mentioned, then their formation can only be explained from radioactive decay. We\u2019ve measured lead ratios for rocks all over the world, meteorite, and even lunar rocks. By measuring the excess lead ratios (208/204, 207/204, 206/204) you can determine the age of materials on million and billion year scales.\n\nEdit: But just the presence is of lead alone doesn\u2019t mean the planet is older than 4000 years.

So, even if our solar system had happened to form on top of a big anomalous blob of radiogenic lead (i.e., lead produced by decay of uranium), we could expect that all of that lead would behave in a *chemically* homogeneous manner, and so you would have a homogeneous ratio of the four lead isotopes throughout the solar system. Some planets or celestial bodies may have more or less absolute concentrations of lead than others, but the proportions of the different isotopes of that lead would be the same across the board.\n\nThis is true regardless of whether there was a blob of radiogenic lead hanging around when the solar system formed. Because uranium is much, much less abundant overall than lead, things like meteorites and comets (celestial bodies too small to have developed layering like most of the planets have) essentially reflect the original isotopic composition of the solar system - what little uranium is in these objects cannot produce enough radiogenic 206Pb, 207Pb, and 208Pb to budge the ratios.",

Like I get the idea of primordial lead and how uranium decays and everything and how we can look at a meteor and based on how much lead vs uranium it has we can estimate how old it is. But I just still don\u2019t get how we can look at a rock and say \u201cThis rock has a ratio of X uranium to Y lead, which means *this rock* is Z years old\u201d rather than \u201cthis rock has a ratio of X uranium to Y lead, which means the *uranium in this rock* is Z years ago and therefore a supernova happened Z years ago to fork this uranium.\u201d\n\nBasically, I just don\u2019t fully understand how we can see the age of the elemental uranium on earth and apply that age definitively to the earth itself.\n\nI hope my question makes sense. Maybe I just don\u2019t understand how uranium forms in the first place, or the answer is something like \u201cbecause of the way uranium and lead is distributed on the planet\u201d that I wouldn\u2019t truly understand without a few college courses on astronomy and statistics. \n\nI can give an example of my line of reasoning, and maybe you can point out the flaw:\nWe can see that the uranium has been on the earth for 4.5B years based on how much of it has decayed into its corresponding lead isotope, and we assume that means the earth has been around for 4.5B years. But what if the uranium formed 4.5B years ago and swirled around for 3B years before the planets started to form, and the earth actually took shape around 1.5B years ago. The uranium would have decayed 4.5B years, we could still determine that based on the decay ratio. But I\u2019m missing the piece that says \u201cThe uranium couldn\u2019t have formed prior to the earth\u201d or \u201cthe lead would have been broken down to carbon during the earth\u2019s formation, but uranium would have survived, so the clock was effectively reset when the earth formed\u201d or something else that tells us that the uranium clock didn\u2019t start prior to the formation of the earth.",

It is possible that a system could undergo a geological process that extracts lead, leaving the new system without any uranium. If that system were dated at that point in time, it would fall on the isochron and give the correct age of the mineral. However, without any uranium present, accumulation of daughter isotopes ceases even though time continues to pass. Such events produce a frozen record, giving the amount of time from crystallization to extraction of lead to form lead ore. Such ages are very useful because they can measure time forward from some known event in the past, such as the formation of the earth.\n\nQuote end\n\nGeological events which have removed / extracted the lead from uranium creates a lead free uranium sample and starts a new clock when looking at lead ratios in that uranium sample in the future. A new clock which can date back to the formation of the earth, for example.\n\nI had the same initial question as you, and that bit above in the paper linked prior answered it for me. The other statements from other redditors replying to you about baselining lead isotopes are also valid, but require more thinking on the math/geochemistry side.",

When the rock is finally formed there is some chunk of uranium stuck in the rock and it starts to decay and the lead is trapped in the rock. \n\nI hope this answers your question and take it with a grain of salt.",

The four isotopes of lead I mentioned before are stable, which means they don\u2019t decay and cannot change into other atoms. Further, as our solar system and planet formed, lead we would not lose any lead. However, all uranium is unstable or radioactive and is continuously decaying. The final atom of the decay chain will be lead. No geological forces can split or fuse atoms, therefore only radioactive decay can change concentrations. This is why I said that the initial given amounts of lead or uranium didn\u2019t matter, only the relative fractions/ratios. When rocks formed with uranium, the final lead would usually remain in the rock and wouldn\u2019t migrate out of the rock. This is how we can measure its age by comparing the amount of uranium to final lead. At the same time we can compare decay lead to primordial lead.",

We see it bind with hydrogen into water, with iron into rust etc.  Oxygen naturally wants to bind to form a more stable molecule, these lab elements are highly unstable and want to do the same thing but instead of binding with something else, it wants to shed some of itself.\n\nThere is a collider in dubna Russia that has been trying to create every element possible to exist, it's a great read if you would like.  You will see that some of those elements are so unstable that once they are formed they decay in nanoseconds (might be microseconds I can't remember) to something more stable.",

The response saying that the existence of lead proving the earth is old is incorrect, for a number of reasons.  First, you would have to prove that the only possible way for lead to exist is by decay from Uranium.  This may or may not be true, I don't know, but young earther probably believes it was just created like everything else.  Either way, without any further arguments there is no more reason for lead to exist than Uranium to exist, so that argument is half a proof at best.  Second, that's not the way that half lives work.  A half life is the time it takes for half of a group of unstable atoms to decay.  The actual decays are random and start happening immediately.  So say you have 1000 unstable atoms with a half life of one day.  After a few minutes you'll start to have a few that have decayed, and by the time 24 hours have passed, about half of them would decay (one half life), leaving 500.  After another day, 750 would have decayed, leaving 250.  After another day, 875 would have decayed, etc.  So even if you start the universe with no lead at all existing, only uranium, then it's not going to take 4.5 billion years to get any lead, that uranium is going to start producing lead immediately.  4.5 billion years is how long it will take for about half of the existing uranium to have decayed.",

Nickel-62 is really tricky for stars to make at all, so it's rare; iron-56 has the property that it's basically [14 helium atoms squeezed together](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Kernfusionen1_en.png) (into nickel-56, which then radioactively decays a couple times into iron-56), hardly tricky at all by comparison. After that peak, it then *requires* energy being put into the system to combine heavier nuclei, and heavier nuclei would release energy with fission down to iron-56 or nickel-62 to reach that peak binding energy stability.\n\n[This diagram](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg/2560px-Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg.png) is widely cited to show you how isotopes are all pushing towards that high binding energy/maximum nuclear stability point. Before iron-56, you get energy out of fusion, after, you get energy out of fission.\n\nBut that doesn't mean you can't fuse heavier nuclei - we do it all the time in the lab with high energy colliders to create superheavy elements, many stars do when they go nova or when they collapse, etc.",

There's a much better explanation of this type of radiometric dating on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93lead_dating):\n\n>[Uranium-lead dating] is usually applied to zircon. This mineral incorporates uranium and thorium atoms into its crystal structure, but strongly rejects lead when forming. As a result, newly-formed zircon deposits will contain no lead, meaning that any lead found in the mineral is radiogenic. Since the exact rate at which uranium decays into lead is known, the current ratio of lead to uranium in a sample of the mineral can be used to reliably determine its age.\n\nUranium-lead dating does work and does prove that the Earth is over 4000 years old. Just not how the guy described in his comment.\n\nAlso, you have a misunderstanding about what half-life means. It means that Uranium-238 takes 9 billion years to decay to half of its original value. Since Earth is less than 9 billion years old, the Uranium-238 that was on Earth when it formed has decayed by less than half so far.",

It's that radioactive isotopes can be used as chronometers to determine when minerals solidified, or essentially became closed systems with no exchange between them and their environment. Then it's a \"simple\" matter of counting the parent and daughter isotopes. We've done this in space rocks (meteorites), Earth rocks, lunar rocks, Martian rocks (Martian meteorites) and they all point to an age of the Solar System being 4.56 billion years (and the Earth formed some 10 million years later). The oldest minerals on Earth are 4.3 billion years old (the Earth was molten for a while).\n\nScience is built on a chain of interlinking facts and deductions, so it can take a long time to go through them all to prove that, no, it couldn't have just happened in space (I presume after nucleosynthesis and before Earth's formation). There's rocks on Earth that date from most of its history in one place or another, though younger rocks are more common due to plate tectonics. All that shows that Earth mostly formed from that early material and then mixed a lot of its bits around as more and more actinides decayed and things melted and reset. Honestly, the most remarkable thing is that we CAN find rocks and minerals that old. Plate tectonics is constantly recycling Earth's crust. I studied a 2 billion year old natural nuclear reactor (Oklo). It's amazing that it formed at all, but also that it was preserved for so long.\n\nBut more to the original silly tweet, we routinely use radiocarbon dating to show ages over the last 10s of thousands of years. We use estimates mutation rates in human DNA to date when populations merged and separated, up to hundreds of thousands of years ago. There's loads more chronometers and so many independent lines of evidence that Earth is *old*.",

But maybe you can make something of these two bits of info.\n.\n\n\n\"Primordial lead\u2014which comprises the isotopes lead-204, lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208\u2014was mostly created as a result of repetitive neutron capture processes occurring in stars. The two main modes of capture are the s- and r-processes.[99]\n\nIn the s-process (s is for \"slow\"), captures are separated by years or decades, allowing less stable nuclei to undergo beta decay.[100] A stable thallium-203 nucleus can capture a neutron and become thallium-204; this undergoes beta decay to give stable lead-204; on capturing another neutron, it becomes lead-205, which has a half-life of around 15 million years. Further captures result in lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208. On capturing another neutron, lead-208 becomes lead-209, which quickly decays into bismuth-209.\"\n\n.\n\n\"232Th is a primordial nuclide, having existed in its current form for over ten billion years; it was formed during the\u00a0r-process, which probably occurs in\u00a0supernovae\u00a0and\u00a0neutron star mergers. These violent events scattered it across the galaxy.[65][66]\u00a0The letter \"r\" stands for \"rapid neutron capture\", and occurs in core-collapse supernovae, where heavy seed nuclei such as\u00a056Fe\u00a0rapidly capture neutrons, running up against the\u00a0neutron drip line, as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can beta decay back toward stability. Neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased\u00a0Coulomb barriers\u00a0that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond\u00a056Fe is\u00a0endothermic.[67]\u00a0Because of the abrupt loss of stability past\u00a0209Bi, the r-process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create thorium and uranium; all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements.[65][68][69]\"",

Your consciousness is an emulated combination of your brain's physical structure and the chemicals running through it. Phineas Gage is my favorite example of this, the guy took a pipe through the frontal lobe and it changed his personality. Even after he physically recovered, his friends were known to say that he was a different person.\n\nThis isn't a bad thing though. I don't think we would ever grow as people if this wasn't the case, and a world full of people who could never change sounds scarier than a world where people change every day.",

I read a problem, draw up some plans, and then go do something else for a bit while my subconscious does some solving. As long as I can get my mind off it completely for a little bit, I can usually come back and then divine guidance comes to me from the ether.\n\n> Some people have to *oppose* their subconcious in order to act like the people they define themselves as, and that part of the brain never shuts off like the rest of us does.

If my muscles were still going I wouldn't be able to sleep because I'd either be punching a wall or grabbing my face lol.\n\n--edit: editing here to let you know I rambled after this point. It's late and my hands go rogue when I'm tired\n\nMy baseless theory is that by doing mostly the same mentally simulating activities (programming and kinds of day dreaming /meditation) since I was 4, I have shaped my brain pathways to the extent that my subconscious is almost exactly the same person.\n\nMy assumptions are built in making and playing with neural networks. Every single little bit of stimulation can cause changes there, and I assume there may be similar processes going on in our own brains. While I wouldn't be able to go into any specifics about how that works, the idea fits observable things about humans. I think what I've said isn't too different from how people build habits. I think it's not just *building up the willpower* to stick to things, I think we are actively tuning our networks. I think whatever is analogous to the *rate of tuning* could explain addiction and why people can be addicted to literally anything. Or why some people can act happy or sad to influence their mood over time.\n\nCould be wrong about a lot of that, but if there's any merit to it, I like the idea that I programmed myself through a lifetime of writing software both as my work and hobby. I think my interests might be a little over tuned because I have little interest in anything else. It's even recently becoming the foundation for mild agoraphobia, as I feel some pretty heavy and genuine dread whenever I think about getting too far from my cloud of machines at home.",

My own assumption is thats how we built up the the pathways that project our conscious minds. Could be both, and I've only considered half of that.\n\nI can see that. Our conscious mind does something, then the subconscious mind updates a little from doing the activity and what the result is, and then the conscious mind is slightly different as a result.\n\nThat's interesting, like the subconscious is using us as an interface to continue tuning/ training. In any case, I'll think about it positively so we can keep our close relationship. My friends who are in the worst of mental states seem to be at odds with theirs.",

Are you saying that there is a point you die, a \"sleep version\" of you is born, and then another point that this \"sleep version\" dies, and then the \"awake version\" is born again? That seems a bit silly considering you have constant brain activity throughout. Can you point to the point these deaths occur and give some evidence for why they might happen?\n\nBut if I had to answer your question, yes I think I could if my body and mind where actually capable of doing that during sleep. I often sleep talk and sometimes I can actually tell that I'm doing it... in those delirious moments between sleep and awakeness when you are sleeping very lightly. And after waking I have asked people if I did sleep talk and they confirmed it.\n\nWould I be able to answer to the same level as my conscious mind? No I probably wouldn't, but that is because sleep is an altered state of mind (taking awakeness as the base state). Just because your mind is not as alert or as aware as when you are awake, doesn't mean you are dead (or a different person) though. When you get so drunk you can't talk properly does that break the continuity?\n\nOverall that question seems a bit manipulative/unfair because the body is physically not able to move during sleep - muscle atonia, and two, because sleeping/dreaming is different state of mind that is not conducive to answering questions. Most people would be stumped at this question - but the question does not even evaluate actual continuity.  As I pointed out at the start - the implicit claim you are making is not backed up by any logic based on what we know about the brain.\n\nYou seem to be saying that \"you\" is your conscious mind only. But why? Why is your \"subconscious\" or your sleeping consciousness not part of you?\n\nI read some of your other comments, and it seems like you treat your sleeping consciousness or subconsciousness as a distinct other that also exists in your brain, when this doesn't seem to be true. Of course when we are learning and talking about these things among ourselves it helps us visualize these things by making them separate, a consciousness and subconscious, but in reality they seem to blend together in a gray zone at some point. I would say that ALL your brain activity is YOU, not just certain parts of it (obviously some have more direct impact on your personality while others are more functional). And all parts of your brain are always active to some extent. Complete shutdown is brain death which nobody recovers from.",

My whole thing is there *isnt* a sleep version of you. When your consciousness receeds and you enter the complete detachment from sensation/memories that is unconciousness, and there is a gap in this 'continuity of self' you mentioned.\n\n>Would I be able to answer to the same level as my conscious mind?

Your dreams are based on your memories, and I've definitely felt sensations in them (other than sight, which is a sensation itself). I also feel like I'm there. It doesn't feel like another person in the dream.\n\nSleep is a time when your mind processes a lot of the memories and information you picked up during the day, so to say that there is a gap is a bit weird, its actually the opposite.\n\nIf you are talking about those moments you don't remember, where you go to sleep and then suddenly you are awake, that still doesn't suggest a gap - it only suggests your mind isn't committing anything to memory.\n\n>What is an 'altered state of mind' in the context of your identity? If continuity is never broken, then its 'you' changing, isn't it?\n\nHmm... changing? Maybe changing in brain activity and level of consciousness yes. But changing in the sense of not being the same continuity? I wouldn't say so. Your brain is still drawing from all your conscious experiences and memories while asleep.\n\nWhy would it be impossible for \"you\" to change? \"You\" change constantly based on the things you experience in life. You probably aren't the same person you were when you were 10, or when you were 4 or when you were 18. I wouldn't say I am the same. \n\nBut changing doesn't mean the continuity has broken. Like a tree growing bigger is still the same tree, but its form has grown.\n\nSo it doesn't seem strange to say that when you are in a depressed state of consciousness you are still you, but just in a less aware form.\n\n>Because its not a part of our mind we are aware of, can't necessarily control, and its something the majority of people wouldn't use to define 'themselves.'\n\nSome parts of it don't define people, like control of your breathing and heartbeat. But some parts are affected by your past experiences. Like your gut instinct. Some people have better gut instincts than others, and what the gut instinct is attuned to will vary by past experiences, by the things that make you you.\n\nSame with \"subconscious\" (I think a lot of the time people say they are struggling with their subconscious when it is just a lack of self control) urges. If you have an urge to eat certain things or are attracted to certain people, that urge is not uniform but tailored to you based on your conscious preferences and experiences. I start to get a craving out of the blue for white chocolate cause I liked it in the past for example.\n\nI would disagree with the idea that just because you can't control parts of it, doesn't make it not part of you.",

What you are talking about is reduced activity, keyword being \"reduced.\" As long as brain activity is preserved there is continuity.\n\nI've done a bit of searching and found nothing saying that when you are unconscious your brain is completely \"off,\" just that you are unable to maintain an awareness of yourself. I don't think being unaware of yourself means you are DEAD or \"OFF\" it just means that you don't have enough brain activity at the moment to maintain awareness. Continuity maintained.\n\nAnd its not like you can argue that that the certain parts of the brain that contain \"you\" are off. [Even under deep anesthesia, nerve cells remain highly active.](https://neurosciencenews.com/anesthesia-neural-activity-5494/)\n\nBut even if what you say is true and unconsciousness \"shuts off your brain\" I've also found nothing saying that you go actually go unconscious during sleep, at least in terms of your definition where it is something that happens when your brain has been damaged.\n\nFrom wikipedia for [unconsciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconsciousness):\n\n\"Loss of consciousness should not be confused with the notion of the psychoanalytic unconscious, cognitive processes that take place outside awareness (e.g., implicit cognition), and with altered states of consciousness such as ***sleep***, delirium, hypnosis, and other altered states in which the person responds to stimuli, including trance and psychedelic experiences.\"\n\nFrom the page on [sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep):\n\n\"Sleep is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by ***altered consciousness,*** relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,\\[1\\] and reduced interactions with surroundings.\\[2\\] It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, ***but more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness, with sleep displaying different, active brain patterns.\"***\n\nWhen you sleep you don't go unconscious in this strict sense. You stay conscious, but lose your conscious awareness.",

You are confusing unconsciousness with 'psychoanalytic unconsciousness'. I'm not talking about implicit cognition, implicit cognition describes the unconcious functions outside of our awareness. We can't *introspect* on our unconscious mind. The topic was 'continuous consciousness', which is our self-perception.\n\nBasically, what is 'you'? Are you your transient recollection of math class, or are you a person who happens to be able to do arithmetic because you *took* a math class? Does your prior experience define the current you, or just shape your development? \n\nThats why I asked you earlier how dreamless sleep felt, to attempt to illustrate that there are gaps in your awareness, that you can *only* speculate on retroactively during times when you are conscious. If psychoanalytic unconsciousness were an aspect of our consciousness, *we would know what the oblivion of sleep feels like.*",

Here is a sketch of the rough idea - however there are important details so study some physics if you want the full story. Certain rocks can be dated based on the RELATIVE abundance of elements in them. For instance if the material is 70% element A and 30% element B and the half life for element A decaying into element B is known, it is possible to infer how old that rock is. This assumes there isn\u2019t random excess element B anywhere near where the to-be-dated rock is located and of course there will be instances of contamination that give incorrect results, or at the very least large error bars. But the point is that taken as a extremely large number of measurements the vast majority agree with each other and the rest of our scientific understanding for the timeline of the universe and life on Earth.",

It's a nonsense \"theory\" to exemplify the burden of evidence - it's literally impossible for there to be any evidence for or against it.  Just like young earth creationism - if you disregard the evidence of the world around us, you can believe whatever the hell you want to believe.\n\nThis is opposed to real theories, in which hypotheses are made based on observations, and evidence is collected to verify or falsify the hypotheses.  Lord Kelvin estimated the age of the earth based on the thermal gradient close to the surface, but assumed the earth to be homogeneous.  Within his lifetime, scientists were moving the estimated age of the earth into the range of a few billion based on a heterogeneous earth (which we now know is the case).",

A god, wizard, holographic reality projector, etc capable of making a universe is surely capable of also making one that looks and feels older than it actually is - we do the same thing, albeit on a *vastly* smaller and simpler scale in video games.\n\nBrain-in-a-jar solipsism aside, what is indisputable is that our world is consistent with one that is billions of years old.  Even if we grant the claim of 4000 \"actual\" years, we still see the effects of the other billions of \"virtual\" years.  Dendrochronology still goes back another 10k or so years, and observations of this \"virtual\" past are fully applicable to the present and future.  This means the question is scientifically useless, and only of philosophical interest.\n\nThat's the key issue to these claims - they're fundamentally undisprovable, because they result in a world no different than the one postulated by the standard theories.\n\n...and on that point, the exact same claim can be made the that world is one *second* old, since of course, your memories could also be part of a universe that looks older than it is.",

I've always been really into ancient mythologies, especially Greek, so that was one of the first times I had ever seen Lucifer presented as a Prometheus-type character. \n\nWhat further cemented my departure from religion was getting my history degree in college. Between writing research papers and in-depth studying of many different cultures, I saw how much of religion is just a reaction to geographical and cultural variables. For example, it says in the Old Testament to stay away from pork and shellfish. That was most likely a response to health issues caused by improperly prepared food. \n\nI also read The Divine Comedies and viewed them as a criticism of the Catholic Church, while I saw Milton's depiction of Satan as a criticism of the infallibility of God. Obviously, anyone can interpret art the way they want; I'm not saying that either piece of literature was written that way, it's just how I related to it.\n\nI can definitely relate to your tangent. I was lucky enough to grow up in one of the best public school districts in the country (at the time) which was in a very diverse suburb in Texas, so I learned from multiple sides of the spectrum. I'd wager that at least 50% of the books I read from 6th grade forward are banned in a more rural or smaller school district. \n\nIn general, learning more about Christianity and other religions is what lead me to question more things and eventually leave it all behind.",

I can't make myself want to break a leg upon landing from a tall  height, and since I know that or worse is the likely outcome of jumping off a building I cannot actually do that. my desires are not choices, they simply are. \n\nI don't choose what food I like nor who I'm attracted to nor my favorite color, those things just are.. they're set by external circumstances as well. what we were brought up to value in a partner, what foods we were exposed to as children, what hormones we were exposed to while our brains developed in combination with just human nature. humans like sugar/fat/salt in their food. I cannot become gay anymore than I can stop liking pizza\n\nI similarly can't choose to believe in a god that there is no proof of, that's just not something I am in control of either. I can't make myself believe the sky is green nor that 2+2=5. I could lie and say I believe those things, but I don't and likely never will.",

So it can be possible to determine the source of a an element in a sample. The ratio of uranium and lead isotopes in a mineral sample will tell us whether that lead exists because it decayed from uranium and how old it is. There are such samples found on earth so we know they\u2019ve been there for longer than 4000 years.",

Through radioactive decay, a natural process. \n\nI thought you were saying you knew of a way that lead \"formed naturally\" without heavier, unstable elements decaying into it.\n\nHere is the relevant Wikipedia paragraph. \n\n>In the s-process (s is for \"slow\"), captures are separated by years or decades, allowing less stable nuclei to undergo beta decay. A stable thallium-203 nucleus can capture a neutron and become thallium-204; this undergoes beta decay to give stable lead-204; on capturing another neutron, it becomes lead-205, which has a half-life of around 15 million years. Further captures result in lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208. On capturing another neutron, lead-208 becomes lead-209, which quickly decays into bismuth-209. On capturing another neutron, bismuth-209 becomes bismuth-210, and this beta decays to polonium-210, which alpha decays to lead-206. The cycle hence ends at lead-206, lead-207, lead-208, and bismuth-209.\n\nLots of decaying going on here...",

In fact, this very problem caused outrage in the church - Lord Kelvin, a creationist scientist (have fun wrapping your head around that) was trying to prove the earth was 6000 years old, but the math gave him a number wildly inconsistent with that. Even with his inaccurate math, he knew it was at least *tens of millions* of years old, with his best guess between 20M and 400M based on his heat conduction theory. The gap was later made up as we came to learn about radioactivity and mantle convection.\n\nOther explanations have been tried, but you either end up with a frozen iron ball or a molten earth - the only way you get a nice crusty hot pocket earth is with a molten earth that cooled with a bunch of radioactive shit slowly decaying. That doesn't rule out someone coming up with a new one, but there's a preponderance of evidence that would be exceptionally hard to overcome, given that we also can use science to determine the age of the sun, our best theories about how planetary systems are formed, etc.\n\nAnd the saddest part? This is stuff we teach in the broad strokes to middle schoolers. By the 9th grade, you should have a core grasp on how the earth formed and thus its age. It just goes to show how catastrophically bad the education system is in some parts of this country.",

Natural formation of lead occurs by radioactive decay of uranium and thorium through radon (222Rn).' Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.1761#:~:text=Lead%20is%20found%20in%20nature,through%20radon%20(222Rn).\n\n'Primordial lead\u2014which comprises the isotopes lead-204, lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208\u2014was mostly created as a result of repetitive neutron capture processes occurring in stars. The two main modes of capture are the s- and r-processes.[99]\n\nIn the s-process (s is for \"slow\"), captures are separated by years or decades, allowing less stable nuclei to undergo beta decay.[100] A stable thallium-203 nucleus can capture a neutron and become thallium-204; this undergoes beta decay to give stable lead-204; on capturing another neutron, it becomes lead-205, which has a half-life of around 15 million years. Further captures result in lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208. On capturing another neutron, lead-208 becomes lead-209, which quickly decays into bismuth-209. On capturing another neutron, bismuth-209 becomes bismuth-210, and this beta decays to polonium-210, which alpha decays to lead-206. The cycle hence ends at lead-206, lead-207, lead-208, and bismuth-209.[101]' \n\nSource: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead\n\nAs for 'whats so special about lead', absolutely nothing. Many elements only occur due to either capturing particles from other elements, or from the decay of other elements. Elements are classified due to their numbers of protons, neutrons and electrons. If they gain or lose these through decay or absorption, they become different elements.\n\nEdit: to answer another part, you're right that fusion could cause this. It does, in the exact way outlined above and in the sources.",

It\u2019s *possible* that every atom decays in the same moment, but in reality that just isn\u2019t going to happen.

Lead dating let's you do two things: since some lead is non-radiogenic (i.e. only produced in supernova and the like), if you have good estimates of the ratios of the lead isotopes at the Earth's formation (hard to find but not impossible), you can look at the current ratio and amount of uranium present now, and estimate the Earth's age.\n\nYou can also look at uranium deposits, especially uranium chemically bound in structures that naturally exclude lead. The lead you find there will therefore be mainly or entirely radiogenic, so by measuring the ratio of lead to uranium in those deposits, you can measure the age of the deposit (which isn't necessarily the age of the Earth, since Earth is pretty geologically active, but is still very useful).",

Not just the earth. I didn\u2019t make that clear.",

If elements heavier than lead are created in star explosions (uranium, radium, and radon merely from the response posted), why wouldn't lead be created in such an explosion?\n\nBut that is beside the point. If the goal is to falsify the hypothesis of the Earth being insta-created 4k years ago (or 6k, or 7.2k, or w/e arbitrarily tiny number a new crackpot may come up with), then saying \"there are products of uranium decay\" _does not_ falsify the hypothesis. The hypothesis is that the Earth was created 4k (or 6k...) years ago _as it is today_, with its lead and uranium contents in quantities currently observed. Falsifying this is a surprisingly non-trivial task (I'm not saying it would be extremely difficult, just that it's not as simple as it may initially appear).",

Their answer to your call for proof is \"the Word is enough\", which is fine for them but why then are they challenging people who don't believe the word of the Bible to be true? Honestly they're giving the burden of proof to themselves and then scoffing at anyone who challenges them.\n\nOn another note I thought I and other Christians believe in an all-powerful God who created everything. Could he not have created a billions-of-years old universe? We very clearly know that the creation narrative in Genesis is written as a poem and in the original Hebrew carries symbolism and structure that transcends literal interpretation, which means it would make more sense that the whole 7 day thing is just a storytelling structure. On the other hand, it could also be argued that this all-powerful God threw in matter that has the form of billions of years old. God could've thrown lead into the mix knowing it was billions of years along its aging process. \n\nNone of that really matters since none of it affects anyone's day-to-day and I think these arguments are insanely stupid if the religious side's only evidence is a holy book that isn't accepted by everyone as fact, but my two cents is God could've done whatever the fuck he wanted to bring us dumb apes together today.",

It's measured this way because radioactive decay follows an exponential curve to the power of 2 over time.\n\nTitanium 44, for example, has a half life of about 63 years.\nIf you had a 1kg block of Ti-44, then you could wait 63 years and the block would then contain only 0.5kg Ti-44 (the rest would be the subsequent elements of it's [decay chain](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_chain). Wait another 63 years, and there's only 0.25kg in there. Wait another 63 years, and you get 0.125kg.\n\nThe process is very consistent as long as you aren't doing something astronomically energetic to the sample (for example, neutron bombardment inside a nuclear reactor or the high energy particle accelerators at CERN).\n\n This consistent timeline for decay allows scientists to accurately  estimate the age of very old things using radiometric dating. Carbon-14 dating has been widely used for ancient human history because it has a half life of about 4.7 millennia. The age of the earth was calculated using to[Uranium-Lead dating](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium%E2%80%93lead_dating) dating: it involves more steps than Carbon-14, but basically it will decay as several different elements until it finally stops at Lead.  This particular decay chain takes billions of years before your samples are too small to measure, so it works great for measuring something as old as the earth itself.",

Example: when we do Uranium 238 to Lead 206 dating, we use Zircon crystals, because Uranium and Zircon atoms are close in size, so when Zircons crystallize from a magma, some Uranium atoms will take the place of Zircon in the crystal structure. These \"impurities\" exist in all crystals in small amounts (natural samples anyway). But Lead doesn't every substitute for Zircon because of its size and shape. So any lead found in the crystal later had to form there through Uranium decay.",

What I meant was, this made me personally think about the nature of the god these people worship and call good, and also the blindness of their faith. \n\nA god that makes every possible effort to make a world appear old, right down to e.g. geological strata, the light of galaxies, fossils, and the presence of carbon and other elements used for assessing the age of those fossils and strata, that does not seem like a friendly god. The Bible calls satan evil and the deceiver of the world, but is that not more appropriate to describe their god, if they believe god made the world this misleading only to then judge us and condemn us to eternal suffering based on our lack of faith?\n\nThe light speed problem and the solutions \u201ccreation scientists\u201d offer, right down to \u201cgod just put the light there\u201d or the c-decay nonsense they at some point posited, also made me realize that this is a faith so blind and fundamentalist that it actively tries to deny the world as we observe it. And consequently, trying to argue with creationists based on any observation made of the world is utterly pointless. That is what makes these arguments dumb. Not that they aren\u2019t persuasive to normal people, but the fact that making them to creationists is inherently dumb, as they will never accept any logical argument and always ultimately fall back on \u201cgod just made it so\u201d.",

If halflife wasn't consistently linear, this ratio wouldn't exist. \n\nThe next argument is just one of scale. A pound of uranium has about 10^26 uranium atoms. The half-life of uranium is 1.41\u00d710^17 seconds. That means over the first 2 billion-ish years it is decaying 354.6 million times per second, on average. This is still law of large numbers territory\n\nEdit - my math on decay rate is wrong. It's apparently 12000 per gram per second for 238U, so 5,436,000 decays per second for a lb",

If that assumption is true, then it's reasonable that He created all of the elements, including stable and unstable elements. \nIt's worth pointing out that traditional Young Earth creationists argue that the Earth was created 6000 years ago, not 4000 years ago. \nIt's also worth pointing out that the claim was made by \"Christians Against Science.\" As a Christian myself, it bothers me that other Christians would position themselves against Science itself, rather than embracing science as a tool to discover the world. Certain Biblical assertions, such as the existence of a global flood (Noah's Flood) that wiped out the majority of land-dwelling animals, are contrary to mainstream scientific thought. Thus a Bible-believing Young Earth creationist should seek to reconcile Biblical history with scientific methods, even if Biblical history cannot be reconciled with mainstream assumptions about the age of the Universe. \nIt's one thing to claim that all scientists are wrong about radioactive decay. It's much simpler to claim that God created some of the end products of radioactive decay.\nIf God in fact exists AND He wrote the Bible using human authors, it follows that we should use the Bible as a foundational text. (I'll dismiss the idea that the Bible was inaccurately transmitted through time by pointing out manuscripts such as the John Rylands fragment of the Gospel of John and and the Dead Sea scrolls). If those starting assumptions are true, we should start with the Bible and use scientific reasoning from there. We should not dispense with scientific reasoning simply because the majority of scientists disagree with our conclusions.\n\nMost scientists start with either of the following Naturalist assumptions: (1) God does not exist, or (2) if God exists, He doesn't interfere with the natural universe. \nCreationists (scientists and non-scientists) assume: (1) God exists, (2) He created the world, and (3) He still interacts with the physical world. Using the Bible as a foundational text and then using scientific reasoning may lead to wildly different conclusions. \n\nWe can both use logic and scientific methods. But when I start from my Creationist assumptions and you start from your Naturalist assumptions, we'll wind up at different conclusions.",

I'm this case, it just takes a REALLY long time for half of it to decay.  The atoms decay beginning immediately, and they do it constantly.  It just takes a REALLY long time for half of them to go.  \n\nImagine an ice cube on a digital weight scale.  As the ice cube melts (which it starts doing immediately, and constantly), the water runs off the scale, and the ice cube gets lighter.  By keeping track of the time, and the mass of the ice cube, you can accurately write an equation for the rate of melting.  Even if it takes 4.5E 9 years for the ice cube to decrease it's mass by half, you can still find the rate of melting, and calculate how long it would take for half of it to melt based on how long it took for a very small portion to melt.",

I.e. you can't have lead unless the heavier elements  decayed into lead. The reality is that our universe started with lighter elements which gathered into masses, eventually undergoing nuclear fusion as stars, and undergoing supernova to achieve the energy necessary to fuse into heavier elements (I believe anything heavier than iron). Just like uranium could be made by nuclear fusion, so too could lead. You could theoretically make lead without ever having uranium, so this whole explanation falls apart.\n\nIt falls apart further when they can just brush off any detailed explanation by saying that God made the lead, and the uranium, and the radon, and so on.",

I think David's paternal family tree is listed at one point as \"Adam, of Adam and Eve, who begot Sam, who begot Brian, who begot David.\" or something like that.
