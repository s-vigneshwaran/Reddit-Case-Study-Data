No, not that anyone has found anyways.  \n\nDoes it then follow that you have to use belief, and therefore become a believer in something, if you take a hard line approach to the answer of a/many/none God without evidence?  yup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoes seeing someone call someone else ignorant for using belief in something while at the same time using belief with the same lack of proof make me giggle a bit?  \n\nyup.",

There isn't.\n\nIf you ask me (nobody did, I know), the purpose of life is:\n\nPurely to express the limitless possibilities present in the universe. We exists not because we should, but because we can. The fact that we exist is fantastic in itself, and should be solace for any weary thinker. Instead, people want some altruistic mega goal to hope for, like \"life's purpose is to be kind and share your unique perspective with everyone\". But it isn't. \n\nThe nature of space and time, and the universe, has made it abundantly apparent that this universe was not made to serve us. And we have no way to serve it, so I don't fathom what people are hoping to find, short of my thought, that we are here literally only because we can be.\n\nSorry it's not a candle in the dark within your gloomy outlook, if you find yourself struggling for reasons to exist, just know that you are not alone in that feeling.",

The reward for winning this competition is a nebulous, eternal afterlife, but since the Space King doesn't speak, no one really knows what that is or who actually gets it. Nonetheless, even if no one has ever actually seen or heard the Space King, we know that he created us in his image, which by proxy makes humans the kings of the earth. But not female humans. Male humans. The females were like, strange clones ripped from ribs or something, and it's actually their fault that everything is bad. According to the Space King, who made them. That no one's ever seen or heard. And if you don't believe this after hearing it, then the Space King is going to put you in jail after you die. Why he wouldn't do it when you were alive, no one really knows because that feels like it would be a lot more effective. But anyways yeah. This is your whole personality now. We stan a lordly king.'",

I guess that means their parenting style is religion.  Regardless of how they are made, it is tragic to them and the entire world.",

No need to convince anyone. Simply let the religious be religious, and convince anyone who was on the fence. Nothing is more effective at recruiting for atheism, than religious bigots.\n\nAccording to pew research, there's been a 1% increase in non-believing Americans every year since 2009. A quarter of the US population now doesn't believe in God. Another decade and at this rate that'll be a third. Soon it'll become impossible to win elections by being overtly religious. And what will happen then? Those who are religious, will protest, get even angrier, more extreme, and convince yet more people to become irreligious.\n\nJust look at Europe. Hell, look at Ireland. Deeply religious country. A few scandals and from 2010 to 2016 the number of people who described themselves as catholic dropped by 10%. Regular church attendance has plummeted. Inevitable result: in 2018 an overwhelming majority to legalise abortion in a country that has historically been deeply deeply Catholic.",

Therefor, I'll just bring a quote by smarter people than me:\n\n\"Seeking a complete annihilation of religion, places of worship were shut down; temples, churches, and mosques were destroyed; artifacts were smashed; sacred texts were burnt; and it was a criminal offence even to possess a religious artifact or sacred text. Atheism had long been the official doctrine of the Chinese Communist Party, but this new form of militant atheism made every effort to eradicate religion completely.\"\n\n*Grim, Brian J.; Finke, Roger (2010).

I think the idea that one should be willing to challenge one's own beliefs is a reasonable interpretation of the Seven Tenets however, and fits within the spirit of the religion as a whole.\n\nWithout speaking for or against TST, in my opinion I think their goal is more accurately described as religious pluralism, rather than the abolishment of religion as a whole. If you look at their history of activism, they've never aimed at removing religious iconography or ritual from the public sphere, but rather to be held on equal footing with mainstream religions. The result of their activism has often been the removal of religious iconography and ritual, but only because the authorities they've challenged have decided to jettison all forms of religious expression, rather than allowing Satanists a seat at the table.",

Reflexively hating an entire class of things is a bad habit. You don't hate *religion*, you hate *dogma* and *superstition* and *irrational thinking*. Those things can exist without religion. \n\nIt also helps to clarify what you're fighting. If you're going to attack \"religion\", then that might include a lot of things that shouldn't be attacked.\n\nBeyond that, you might be missing out on a lot of good things because you've assigned a religious label to them. The way that Satanists band together and help other Satanists is something that I don't see in other atheist communities. When Lucien talks about ceding ground to the religious, he isn't just talking about stuff like the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.",

I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, and the grossest of all libels. Never was there a clearer case of 'stealing the livery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in.' I am filled with unutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious pomp and show, together with the horrible inconsistencies, which every where surround me. We have men-stealers for ministers, women-whippers for missionaries, and cradle-plunderers for church members. The man who wields the blood-clotted cowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday, and claims to be a minister of the meek and lowly Jesus. . . . The slave auctioneer\u2019s bell and the church-going bell chime in with each other, and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned in the religious shouts of his pious master. Revivals of religion and revivals in the slave-trade go hand in hand together. The slave prison and the church stand near each other. The clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in the prison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church, may be heard at the same time. The dealers in the bodies of men erect their stand in the presence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other. The dealer gives his blood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers his infernal business with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion and robbery the allies of each other\u2014devils dressed in angels\u2019 robes, and hell presenting the semblance of paradise.\u201d\n\n>\u2015 Frederick Douglass, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass",

To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.\n\n- Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.\n\n- People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.\n\n- Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.*",

Of course, there is nuance here.  Someone may believe that raising a cow in a humane pasture setting and painlessly slaughtered is still a compassionate act while factory farming isn't.\n\nIn practice (from what I gather of folks like the Satanic Temple folks), I don't expect most of them give much more thought about this than any other secularly-minded person does (i.e. usually not enough to change their eating habits).\n\nBut you're right that this feels like something left intentionally vague and lawyerly.  When we're all left to define for ourselves what is \"reasonable\", then the tenet doesn't really mean much.

But they respected the animals, and nature. They used as much of the animal as they could for tools, clothes, food, etc as possible as a way to respect the animal. That's a form of empathy, not cruelty. They understood they had ended the animals life, and they owed it for feeding them.\n\nIt's much the same. You can live your desires while respecting the magic of the world around you, and not being cruel to other beings.\n\nReading beyond this would be intentionally divulging into black and white semantics.",

I was convinced as a very young child that I wasn't good enough to go straight to heaven when I die, I figured I'd need to wait around in Purgatory for however long, because kids who swear a little sometimes or argue with their siblings or say not-nice things about their mean mom don't get to go to heaven. As a little kid! No little kid should be made to feel like a rotten person for doing the things literally all little kids do.\n\nAnywho, I took a world history class in college and found out about Luther and his grievances, and that Purgatory is a fucking scam. I can't tell you how much that fucked with my head, that such a big component of my anxieties and self esteem issues were all a greedy fucking lie. I'd already been battling with myself for a few years about my religion and where I stood with it, but that was the last straw. I still personally believe in a higher power and I still follow Jesus' basics (treat others the way you want to be treated, etc).",

People's religion has no place in public life, in terms of defining laws and social policy. It should not be obligatory to be Christian to be elected to public office, prayers should not be said before sessions of court or Municipal Council, and other people should not be allowed to force their religious beliefs on the rest of us. But those problems are endemic in the US, where the religious right are continuously trying to push certain agendas and push their religion into public life at a level. It's natural for people to push back against that too.\n\nI'm Canadian and it's wildly different up here. If somebody even vaguely suggested the idea that a kid should say prayers in a non religious school oh, that a city council meeting should start with a religious invocation, etc, we'd lose our kit.",

The Bible and other biblical texts are a result of early man\u2019s poor attempt at understanding of the world around him and explaining what must have seemed to be otherworldly.  Early on, humans didn\u2019t even know what makes the winds happen, how rivers flow, why something thrown into the air always comes back down but birds seem to be able to stay up there and that stars weren\u2019t just campfires of distant tribes from faraway lands.  It took *science*-the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment-for man to gradually get to the point where he understands the world around him as he does today.  Because he made careful observations, tested theories and compared measurements, he now knows Earth isn\u2019t the center of the universe nor is it flat, how fire occurs, why the air isn\u2019t glitter-filled pink and those points of lights in the night are actually stars just like our own Sun, only really very far away (and some of those points are other worlds like Earth as well as other structures in the universe, like nebulae, star clusters and distant galaxies filled with billions of stars).  Biblical texts and beliefs are emotional constructs.",

Satanic Temple, which reddit is usually talking about these days. They're atheist activists who don't actually believe in Satan, they use him symbolically and use their \"religion\" ^(emphasis on the quotation marks haha) mostly as conduit for their activism, hence being popular amongst atheists. You can [find their tenets here](https://thesatanictemple.com/blogs/the-satanic-temple-tenets/there-are-seven-fundamental-tenets).\n2. LaVeyan Satanists. These folk are also atheists who don't believe in Satan, and also just use him symbolically. They take themselves a bit more seriously as a religion, but are nonetheless atheists, also relatively rare and folk aren't usually talking about them when they mention Satanists. You can [find their tenets here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Satanism#The_Nine_Satanic_Statements).\n3. Edgy Christians who reject Christ and unironically believe Satan exists, and worship him. These folk are exceptionally rare, because you can't ~~be a Satanist~~ *believe in Satan** without believing in Christ and his associated god, so it makes little sense to worship Satan in this context (like, one would have to be a total dumbass, doubling down on the delusion like that). You can [find their tenets here](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls034369750/).\n\nIf I *had* to estimate I'd say that around 97% of Satanists fall in to the first category, 2.9% into the second, and 0.1% in to the third.\n\n*e: d'oh",

Please take a look.\n\nI\nOne should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.\n\nII\nThe struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.\n\nIII\nOne\u2019s body is inviolable, subject to one\u2019s own will alone.\n\nIV\nThe freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.\n\nV\nBeliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.\n\nVI\nPeople are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.\n\nVII\nEvery tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.",
