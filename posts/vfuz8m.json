It\u2019s almost as if, by being born, they have died to you. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus but actually dislike people who breathe.\n\nPrisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.\n\n-dave barnhart",

When even that won't work, gerrymander illegally and keep suing until \"welp, too close to an election, I guess you guys get to use the fucked maps\" ([Alabama](https://www.salon.com/2022/06/02/lets-states-use-illegally-gerrymandered-maps-in-2022-midterm_partner/))\n4. When that fails, incite violence (Jan 6th)\n\nTexas will _never_ be blue, and it doesn't matter if the citizens are 90/10 Democrats. It's a forgone conclusion. It's not even hypothetical as we can see all the parts _currently in action, here, today_.\n\nThe best solution is to rob Texas of representatives in the House and fuck it economically with a lack of citizens.\n\nI really wish I didn't believe this but in June 2022 there are too many prominent, publicly available lines of evidence that say \"Republicans won't let power switch anymore\".",

Denmark is a market economy,\" albeit with \"an expanded welfare state which provides a high level of security to its citizens.\"\n\nRasmussen's model,\u00a0Vox's Matthew Yglesias wrote at the time, \"is not especially different, as a substantive matter, from\u00a0what Sanders is saying.\" Sanders wants \"higher taxes, a lot more social welfare spending,\" and single-payer health care, he adds\"\n\nThat's from that article.

They are hamstrung by two things: 1) the fact that most of their voters are clustered in cities, and 2) the structure of the American political system, which awards political power not on the number of votes, but by geography. That means that Republicans control more land than Democrats, which means that Republicans have an influence on politics far greater than sheer numbers would allow. \n\nCouple that with all the anti-majority bias built into the system and it's frankly a miracle that Democrats are not a  permanent minority, in terms of power. \n\nThe last time Democrats controlled the Presidency and the Congress with a filibuster-proof majority was a two year span from 2008 to 2010. Politics was waaay different back then. Not to mention, Democrats did not have control of the Supreme Court, which fucked them.\n\nYou might not like the current state of American politics but don't blame the only people who are trying to fix it. Blame the terrorists on the other side that want to burn everything to the ground, and have been given a flamethrower by the old white men who wrote the Constitution.",

I thought he could at least agree that Biden won, but no, he says it was stolen.

They refuse to still even listen to anything that might prove them wrong. If they somehow get exposed to information that proves them wrong they just reject it without even giving it a moment of thought. It is fucking dangerous and it's only going to get much worse before it even has a chance to get better. January 6th didn't make Republicans think twice about what their side is doing, it emboldened them. The slaps on the wrists for the Trump terrorists straight up encourages them to try again.",

The Texas Republican Party is a private organization, not a government body, even if some of its members are representatives.  As an organization, they are free to reject the legitimacy of the Biden presidency regardless of whether their position is based on the Big Lie or not.  Likewise, they can call for secession from the United States.  However, actually following through with it is another thing entirely.\n\nWhat we're seeing more often in the US these days are real-world examples of the paradox of tolerance.  Dishonest actors like these religious fascists take full advantage of the First Amendment to gain power, even though that power, when taken to the extreme they seek, will ultimately destroy the First Amendment and other freedoms.",

Asking if they would be available to consult, advise, research and report on the logistics of a state leaving the union. you wouldn't have to actually have any meetings, the government just shrugs it off saying work and payments cant officially begin until the articles of succession have been served and that they are simply setting up a call list of all the necessary experts. you point to how the EU handled Brexit as a modern framework of how to handle something like that, using my country's fuck up as an example of what will happen to Texas or any other state that thinks this might be a good idea.",

Besides the very idea that humans are animals is abhorrent to them (even though we most certainly are animals), it would open debate about the morality of eating animals and there are countless lobbyists that would see that as a call to arms on both sides of the argument.\nOne fantastic point as a corollary to yours that I thought about earlier is the idea of teaching about \"fetal humanity\", considering how nearly indistinguishable a human embryo is from other mammals and primates until various stages of development. I doubt they considered the Pandora's Box of evolution and other sciences that go against their religion that they are opening with that sort of ridiculousness. Or what about the citizenship claims if life \"starts at conception\"? And of course there are the tax scenarios and others that have been brought up. You know someone will try something like that just to force their hand in the courts. That is if they do not put these forced births up as wards of the state and they have to deal with the financial burden of caring for them. Id they do not, then sue for everything you are able (lost wages, mental anguish, pain and suffering, environmentally-caused illnesses (eg asthma)) and let them drown in legal fees.\n\nI completely agree with you WRT \"fetal rights\". I think Roe walked a decent line of protecting privacy rights with the line drawn at a reasonable boundary of viability (with medical exceptions beyond that).

But Fox News and the right wing media apparatus takes advantage of that. \n\nPersonally I think we need a bigger strategy to call out the lies. Democrats resort to logic and reason and podcasts to correct the status quo. This isn\u2019t effective. First of all the human mind works with emotional pleas not just logic. We need to appeal to that aspect of the mind. \n\nAdditionally, we need to find a more effective way to get the message to the people. For example, I live in texas. In a relatively democratic leaning area: Houston. \n\nLast time I drove to Houston from my hometown I ran into multiple propaganda billboards. And every election cycle we are bombarded by radio ads. \n\nPeople spend a lot of time commuting in cars. These methods appeal very efficiently to the voters. \n\nMy belief is we need more billboards and more radio ads. We need to actively go out and say these are lies. Call out the lies.

I think it is far more effective to argue that if someone wants to choose to be homosexual, then that's completely OK. Wasting time debating whether one has volition in their sexuality is moot if we assume that to be plausible, and that all choices are legitimate. At that point, it doesn't matter whether sexuality is a choice or not, the only opposing argument is, \"I don't approve of your freedom of choice.\" That is a totally valid viewpoint, but it really lays bare the crux of those who disapprove of homosexuality: to quote former president G.W. Bush, \"They hate freedom.\" There will always be those who outright reject homosexuality regardless of any reasoning or justification, so that's not a solvable problem, but for those who are willing to consider opposing viewpoints, make them answer why people can't have the freedom of choice in whom they love?\n\nAll that being said, I don't feel comfortable making any absolutist declarations one way or another on whether sexuality is a choice, I've just never understood why it should be a bad thing if one chooses to be a homosexual. I think arguing that one can't help it if they're homosexual makes their sexuality akin to a disease, that it should be allowable because it cannot be fixed. If the statement, \"I was born this way\" is true, then it reinforces the idea to some that being queer means someone is broken or flawed in some way. Let's stop pretending that it matters how someone is born or how they became who they are, let's embrace \"I am this way.\" Let the opposing side justify why you shouldn't be free.",

So let them believe that sexuality is a choice and shift the focus to the value of personal freedom; make the person who believes that homosexuality is a sin admit that what they really are opposed to is letting people live their lives according to their own free will, that what they really want is to treat queer people like subhumans simply because they are different.",

It's just obviously true that nobody chooses their sexuality. You can't force yourself to be attracted to someone. Straight people couldn't just choose to be gay, they couldn't just decide to feel attraction to the same sex, in the same way gay people can't just choose to be straight and bi people can't choose to not be bi, you can't force yourself to stop feeling attraction.

It probably **is** undesirable, I don't imagine feeling inclined towards homosexuality is an easy thing to choose to act on. Tons of gay people have expressed having sleepless nights where they just wished they were straight so their life would be/feel easier.\n\nWith that contextual reasoning in mind, it's at least partially a choice, in that many younger ones choose to refrain from engaging in acknowledging their homosexuality until they get to an older age where they feel more comfortable in their own skin, and come out of the closet, as is often said.\n\nThe amount of youth identifying as anything but straight has gone up about a thousand percent in the last 15 years. So right now, there's a lot of interesting talk in the air about how much of this is being culturally shaped, versus how much of it is a byproduct of a more accepting society that allows these people to be more open. Personally I think it's some degree of both, along with other factors, but I'm not versed enough in this area of knowledge to feel confident in concretely backing my opinion.\n\nAll I stated in my comment is that homosexuality is abnormal - because it is. That doesn't mean homosexuals are lesser in any sense. But it is certainly abnormal, and hopefully one day that word is owned.",

Tons of gay people have expressed having sleepless nights where they just wished they were straight so their life would be/feel easier.\n\nSo being gay in society is more difficult than being straight, hmm think it could have anything to do with large portions of society declaring them to be abnormal and undesirable, not to mention unnatural and immoral (a clear part of the Christian right\u2019s message)?\n\n>All I stated in my comment is that homosexuality is abnormal - because it is. That doesn't mean homosexuals are lesser in any sense. \n\nAgain I ask you the question you completely failed to address: then what is the point of a political party declaring this as part of their platform? \n\nIt would be like a party declaring \u201credheads are abnormal.\u201d Or how about declaring that people who enjoy running ultra-marathons are abnormal? Who gives a shit and what is the point?",

I would disagree that it is unnatural - homosexual tendencies are found in all sorts of animals.\n\nFrom the perspective of a need for perpetuating the human race, homosexuality is **also** undesirable. From the perspective of morality, it depends on where you believe morality is derived from. If one, like Christians, believes it is derived from the Bible, then it's not shocking at all to suggest that homosexuality is also immoral.\n\nI didn't address that question mostly because I don't believe they are declaring what I've stated here. Their argument is that a homosexual lifestyle choice is abnormal - which is subtle but largely different from my claim, which is that homosexuality is abnormal. For example, even though homosexuality is abnormal, it is perfectly normal for a homosexual to exhibit homosexual lifestyle choices.",

Because that, even if not your position, you seem to agree is the position of those making this policy declaration. \n\n>From the perspective of a need for perpetuating the human race, homosexuality is also undesirable\n\nI disagree. Maybe you meant something more like \u201cmaximizing the rate of direct reproduction by each individual in a society\u201d - but broadly speaking, *perpetuating* clearly involves a lot more than merely maximum number of babies created by every individual\u2026 having healthy environments for people to grow up in would also matter. Lowering rates of suicide probably wouldn\u2019t hurt. Increasing the number of caring households available to raise the babies that are around would probably help\u2026",

I think everything should be questioned and challenged, every single thing - things you think are good that I don't, and things I think are good that you don't.\n\nI also agree with all of the things you suggested in the second part of your comment that would assist with that perpetuation. I imagine you and I have different thoughts on how those things can be best realized.\n\nAt any rate, it can only be a negative, from the perspective of attempting to maximize the variables that lead to human reproduction,  to minimize the amount of humans choosing to reproduce naturally. It can literally only be a negative, because we can continue to add alternative methods of human reproduction (in the event that you decide to invoke the idea of test tube babies en masse), while still as a species promoting lifestyles that lead to population growth.\n\nI know it's not popular to strip emotion from humanity, but when we are talking about the lifeline of humanity as a whole, it becomes a numbers game, and we are already decades away not only from population beginning to stabilize and then drop, but also from the fallout that will result in that. Almost every single global institution presupposes continued human population growth\n\nOne easy example is that real estate has basically always gone up in value because there's always more people being born - if population begins to shrink, that entire market will likely implode, at the same time other industries begin imploding for the same depopulation fundamentals.\n\nIt is not shocking that people want to attempt to extinguish widespread acceptance of homosexual relationships. It's the same reason pound for pound, government assistance for impotence gets more expenditure than birth control does. Government inherently benefits from population growth, and while you or I will be here for maybe 80 years, most countries are working around timelines that go hundreds or thousands.\n\nAll this is outside any moral or religious argument at all, I don't bother invoke those because we certainly do not agree there either (deist for most of my life, recently chose Jesus as my savior - not a blind or quick decision there either. I have questions about my faith all the time, including many disagreements I'm attempting to work out)",

We could, for example, have homosexual male couples supporting reproductive surrogates (homosexual female couple could of course get pregnant themselves via several means) which would help maximize births from those who can viably give birth.\n\nAnd why should we want to simply \u201cmaximize the variables that lead to human reproduction\u201d in the first place? To me that\u2019s a very misguided objective that misses the forest for the trees - why do we want humanity to perpetuate? I imagine because we see being alive as preferable to not being alive, and are seeking to maximize that and give more people the opportunity to enjoy a fulfilling life. That includes, if you happen to be gay, having the freedom to be so without being persecuted for it.\n\n>I know it's not popular to strip emotion from humanity, but when we are talking about the lifeline of humanity as a whole, it becomes a numbers game\n\nOnly if you arbitrarily decide that the pure numbers are all that matter, which again even then I think you\u2019re wrong. But hey, why not institute 100% pre-arranged marriages, outlaw birth control, and put minimum reproductive quotas in place? \n\n>Almost every single global institution presupposes continued human population growth\n\nIt\u2019s almost like we should prepare for the actual future and putting institutions in place which best support it, rather than forcing society to behave in a way that happens to best fit some particular current institutions\u2026 I mean why build new roads when we could just focus on building off road vehicles so that we can all traverse crumbling pavement? \n\n>One easy example is that real estate has basically always gone up in value because there's always more people being born - if population begins to shrink, that entire market will likely implode\n\nWould you support large scale immigration from currently overpopulated countries to those with more available housing supply?\n\n>It is not shocking that people want to attempt to extinguish widespread acceptance of homosexual relationships\n\nNot shocking perhaps, though I think it should be. I mean what is the rationale for wanting to extinguish this? Because you think more gay people will eventually make your house value go down? If looking at gentrified neighborhoods is any indication, the more pride flags flying the better the housing prices are doing! \n\n>All this is outside any moral or religious argument at all, I don't bother invoke those because we certainly do not agree there either\n\nI\u2019d hope we can agree that seeking a happy and fulfilling life, helping others and treating others as we know we\u2019d prefer to be treated, should be part of whatever we\u2019re working toward.",
