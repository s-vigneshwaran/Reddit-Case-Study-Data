But the 2nd Amendment was always about making sure the states had militia and that they were organized and regulated so they could be effective national defense if needed.\n\nA bunch of yahoos with \"Dont step on snek\" flags is not a defense against the government.",

The purpose was written into the second amendment: it was because a \"well-regulated militia\" was considered \"necessary to the security of a free state.\" They wanted to be able to mount a defense in the event of a foreign incursion, but also they were principally interested in avoiding having to maintain a standing army. Alexander Hamilton wrote that a well-regulated militia \u201cthe most natural defense of a free country.\u201d The founding fathers were proposing that all free men be enrolled in a militia, so the the right to bear arms existed entirely within the context of militia participation. There were groups of people who were not allowed to participate in a militia, such as blacks and native Americans. The purpose of them being unarmed was to maintain a power differential where arms-bearing whites exerted control over non-whites.\n\n\nIt wasn't until *DC vs Heller* in 2008 that the supreme court ruled that the second amendment protected an *individual's* right to bear arms outside of the context of militia participation. You can thank Scalia for that. The founding fathers simply didn't care about the individual's right to bear arms. So before 2008, you could have made the argument that, *since a militia is no longer considered necessary to the security of a free state*, it would be okay to infringe on the right to bear arms in certain circumstances. That's just not the case anymore. But the idea that the founding fathers were interested in preserving the ability of the general population to overthrow their government is laughable. Look at the anti-sedition laws from the Whiskey Rebellion! The stance of the government was clear: \"What we did to England? Yeah, don't you dare do that to us.\"",

There's *nothing* in that verse about the location that the act takes place, *nothing* specifying that it only applies to certain cultures or at certain times, *nothing* about foreign festivals, and *nothing* about whether the act is consensual or non-consensual. There's also *nothing* about the age of the participants beyond using the word for \"adult man\" both times- but note that Mosaic law considers a boy to be an adult from his early teens onward, which is not the sort of thing that's consistent with a culture which has figured out that \"children having sex = bad\". Anyone who tells you that the verse *does* say any of those things is **lying to you**. With [very few exceptions](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/gay/long.htm), the same is true about [the rest of the homophobic verses](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/homosexuality.html) in both the Hebrew Old Testament and in the Greek New Testament.\n\nThis act of revisionist propaganda is every bit as slimy and dishonest as trying to claim that the Bible doesn't endorse slavery, or that the US Civil War was about \"States Rights\", or that the Holocaust never happened. And in addition to *that*, it's *also* a sneaky attempt to justify homophobic propaganda that draws false equivalence between LGBT people and pedophiles. (Ironically, not only does the Bible **never** directly condemn pedophilia, it [frequently encourages it](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/pedophilia.html)).\n\nNow that you know better, please refrain from repeating this lie in the future.",

There's *nothing* in that verse about the location that the act takes place, *nothing* specifying that it only applies to certain cultures or at certain times, *nothing* about foreign festivals, and *nothing* about whether the act is consensual or non-consensual. There's also *nothing* about the age of the participants beyond using the word for \"adult man\" both times- but note that Mosaic law considers a boy to be an adult from his early teens onward, which is not the sort of thing that's consistent with a culture which has figured out that \"children having sex = bad\". Anyone who tells you that the verse *does* say any of those things is **lying to you**. With [very few exceptions](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/gay/long.htm), the same is true about [the rest of the homophobic verses](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/homosexuality.html) in both the Hebrew Old Testament and in the Greek New Testament.\n\nThis act of revisionist propaganda is every bit as slimy and dishonest as trying to claim that the Bible doesn't endorse slavery, or that the US Civil War was about \"States Rights\", or that the Holocaust never happened. And in addition to *that*, it's *also* a sneaky attempt to justify homophobic propaganda that draws false equivalence between LGBT people and pedophiles. (Ironically, not only does the Bible **never** directly condemn pedophilia, it [frequently encourages it](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/pedophilia.html)).\n\nNow that you know better, please refrain from repeating this lie in the future, /u/caraamon.",

Why is it so hard for the church to just do what\u2019s right? I don\u2019t understand the hesitation in seeking justice for victims of abuse? I understand why corporations and politicians act abhorrently because of greed money power but churches shouldn\u2019t(I know that they do but they shouldn\u2019t, that\u2019s their whole deal, in RSA we have churches that are just people in a field every Sunday but we also have mega churches and weird tv prophets so it\u2019s a mixed bag of degrees of profit). What is there to gain by allowing this assault on youth trusted in the care of religious leaders? How does the church gain by dragging its heels or standing in the way of the legal process? I\u2019m 32 now and I\u2019ve been hearing about these sexually assaults my whole life, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard of a priest being held accountable? Just moved to another parish. What purpose or reasoning is there for protecting pedophiles? Seminaries are still full so there\u2019s no shortage of new priests so why keep the old perverts? How many thousands of cases world wide have to be brought to courts before the church does something? Seriously asking cause unfortunately religion isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon and as long as it\u2019s going to affect the people around me and the world I live in I really need answers.",

The reason the statute of limitations exists is partly because as time passes it becomes impossible to find people, documents, and other evidence in order to defend a case. A window was opened for these people to bring their claims, already well outside time periods a court would normally consider--and to the extent this activity was being hidden most states have mechanisms to extend the statute of limitations on that basis.\n\nThe notion that people are somehow now discovering harm that they were not aware of before doesn't seem logical to me. It seems, frankly, like a plaintiffs attorney trying to get paid.",
