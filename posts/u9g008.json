Group homes are pretty miserable and generally kids don't stay there long, they place them with a foster family as soon as possible. But usually they have to switch around between various foster homes. Kids who grow up in the foster care system have really poor success rates in life, it's definitely harmful to them.\n\nIt's obviously much better for the kid to have a stable home with a family who loves and wants them instead of growing up in the system. Even if orphanages were still a thing, you can't possibly believe it's not harmful for a kid to grow up in an orphanage rather than with a stable family. They're being hurt by having to grow up in the bad environment of the system rather than a much better and healthier environment of a stable family.",

I mean your kid won't live anywhere near as long as the universe anyways so what's the difference if the universe ends at some point billions of years after your kid dies? That doesn't effect the decision to breed. People just do it because they like kids and it makes them happy to have a loving family. If there's no purpose to life, the only thing to do it just make the best of the time you have and do whatever makes you happiest, and for some people having kids is what makes them happiest.",

That was not the answer.\n\nWyatt also said that although they have not dealt with any such cases, **she\u2019s unsure whether her agency would facilitate an adoption for a birth mother who, for example, expressed a preference for a non-religious home**. She and her husband, who co-own the agency, would have to discuss the issue, she said.\"\n\nSo if you're a theist mother you can specify, but if you are an atheist mother who wants an atheist family for the baby you most likely ***cannot*** even use the same agencies.

My sister and I found her daughter and I paid for a ticket for Izzy (daughter) to come and meet her mom, and our family.  It was one of my proudest moments.  They kept in close touch until my sister fell while living alone, hit her head and was unconscious in ICU.  One look and I could tell Sue was gone.  After the family all had a chance to come in and see her for one last time, I asked the nurse to up the pain medication and I was there when she stopped breathing.  I still miss her so much.  She was 1 year and 20 days younger then myself.",

She and her husband, who co-own the agency, would have to discuss the issue, she said.\"\n\n\nBasically the business is saying, most of our biological parents ask for religious homes and so that's who we cater to. We dont think it's worth or time or effort to vet non religious adopters as a non religious adopter doesnt meet the requirements for our biological parents most of the time.\n\nIt's like asking Starbucks to get a liquor license in case someone shows up and wants to buy 20 keg.s of rum. It's not that starbucks couldn't do this, but that's not their business and it's not worth the effort to get that license for this relatively rare event.\n\nYour mad at the wrong people.

There are so so so many children up for adoption in North America, to deny a family because the family doesn't have the same religion as the people running the adoption center should be fucking criminal. Because that's what's happening here. This isn't a case of one woman saying \"please make sure my baby goes to a theist household\" and an atheist family demanding to take that particular baby. This is a case of an adoption agency telling a couple they will not adopt *any child* to them because the couple is not of their preferred religion.\n\nThey even specifically said if an atheist mother requested an atheist family they wouldn't help her and she'd need to go somewhere else. So your point is totally wrong because they straight up have said they don't care about the wishes of the mother if it doesn't suit their personal beliefs. I guarantee they have plenty of children who come from situations where the mother wasn't religious or didn't want or was capable of having a say in who her baby was adopted to. But this agency has decided that every child in their care is now of their religion and will only go to families who are also their religion. \n\nIf the adoption agency was, say, Muslim, and they decided every single child that went through their care was now Muslim, and would only be adopted to Muslim families, regardless of the wishes of the mother, how would you feel about that? Because I have a hunch you only think indoctrinating children is okay when it's *your* beliefs..",

The point is that if abortions aren't allowed there will be way more kids put up for adoption, because people who get pregnant but don't want a kid won't be able to abort so they'll have to put the kid up for adoption. So conservatives want to ban abortions, creating way more kids up for adoption that need homes, but they also want to heavily restrict who is allowed to adopt, meaning lots of kids who need homes will just end up stuck in the system, because many of the families who want them won't be allowed to adopt. So they purposely want to create a world where more kids don't have families and have to grow up in the foster care system, which is proven to be damaging to them. So they're lying when they say they care about kids\u2014they obviously don't, since they're trying to create a world where way more kids are unable to have families. When speaking against abortion, they claim to support adoption, but then actually they want to deny adoptions to suitable families and leave kids in the system instead.",

Forced adoptions are considered a form of genocide - a way of wiping out a population not by killing, but by impeding their continued existence. \n\nThe not-adopting-to-non-christians is the same effort in reverse. These Christian Ethnonationalists view the adoption process as one way to preserve white christian supremacy.",

In response, they created private schools that would only allow white students. Oftentimes, these schools were private religious institutions. They were called segregation academies and \"Freedom of Choice\" schools. Although outright segregation academies became illegal, they have left behind a legacy of Christian academies and charter schools. \n\nI could go on and on about the myriad ways that the Christian Right pushes hard on issues that are proxies for or stand-ins for race. The truth is that their religious arguments are a thin veil for racial arguments.",

They also respect the rights other their community members to be Jewish or Muslim or Hindu, as long as no one is an extremist.

              "text": "This was a lot to get through so I just lumped all my responses in a single reply for simplicity.\n\n**Power is a means to an end. Control IS the end.** Control was always the goal throughout history. Feeding off the working class, owning women and slaves (but I repeat myself), maintaining legacies and lineages and passing down wealth to continue the control in future generations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There's a pretty big difference between an ideology who's sole function was the extermination of every race but their own and a group of religious people. We're not talking about religious extremists here anyway, we're talking about regular Christians. \n\nEvery religion's end goal is the extermination of all other beliefs. The crusades were about extermination. Modern Christians just can't get away with mass murder anymore, but they still go around the world and convert. In Africa, Christian 'charities' require bible readings every morning before breakfast. If kids don't read, they don't eat. \n\nNot every Nazi was interested in the extermination of the Jews. For many it was just a job, seriously. In 'The Banality of Evil', Adolf Eichmann, one of the principle figures of the holocaust, was tried for his crimes and was found to have no significant hatred for Jews. He was literally just following orders. \n\nIt's not hard to see how many Christians are doing the same now. Just 'following orders' when they're told to vote Republican because Republicans are the 'Christian' party. You know how many Christian's I talked to think Obama wasn't a Christian?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You really think there is some grand conspiracy that all the Christians are in on about controlling everybody else?\n\nI don't think it's a conspiracy. It's out in the open. Banning abortion, gay marriage, trans rights, voter suppression. Ever since Trump took office they haven't bothered to hide it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You people act like you've never met a Christian before. They just want what's best for everybody\n\nAnd you act like there's only one type of Christian. There was a time when I would have believed that 'most' Christians did want what's best for people, but that time is long gone. The laser focus on one topic (abortion in this case) blinds them to all other moral failures of their party and faith.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Control in what way?\n\nControlling women's sex lives and stripping them of their bodily autonomy. How is that that needs to be explained? They don't make exceptions for rape or incest. A man can literally rape them and the women have zero recourse. In some states the rapist can even sue for custody! This isn't about helping women or the kids. It's about making sure women do what they're told.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Where are these conservatives saying they just want control? \n\nThat's not how scams work. You don't tell someone you're scamming them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Many Christians I've met have been very friendly, helpful people. But they are brainwashed \n\nAnd I've met many that weren't, what's your point? Being brainwashed isn't an excuse. They have full access to the internet, now, but they're refusing to acknowledge simple truths in service of a comfortable lie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Their intention is to lead others to their faith. \n\nBy any means necessary, right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And for what it's worth, requiring a marriage certificate to get married at all is control. It shouldn't be a thing at all. You don't got a problem with that control, do you? \n\nI do if it prevents you from getting married, but it doesn't. You can go to any church and have a priest marry you and it's 100% legit 'in the eyes of God'. You can even live with someone and call yourself married and the government won't bother you (assuming you're not trying to scam them). What the certificate does is provide the state a way to create the family unit for taxes, benefits, mortgages, etc. Since we're here, the bible saying marriage is between 1 man and 1 woman is also a form of control and that, obviously, I have a problem with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Hell, they aren't even dumb. They have been subjected to a belief system from a very young age that compels everything they do. \n\nThat's what makes them dumb. I was also subject to that same belief system. I went (was taken) to church every Sunday. I went to Sunday school and actually read the bible! I learned and changed. It was scary, but I did it. They don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Is the religion echoing their prejudice or are they prejudice because it's what their religion demands of them? The Bible is pretty clear about homosexuality. The book is prejudice. \n\nNot really clear. There's a hand full of lines that can be interpreted as prejudiced against homosexuality, but since sexuality has been a VERY murky subject for millennia and people didn't know about X and Y chromosomes until the 20th century I'd venture they didn't really think too hard about it. Homosexual wasn't even a word until the 19th century.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Why was the book written this way? Likely because tribalism and prejudice is innate in the human psyche and many religions are pre-historic in origin. They come from a time when perhaps the prejudices were helpful. \n\nAnd that time has come and gone and those prejudices are no longer helpful. Well, I guess they're helpful for getting elected. Disenfranchising voters also helps. The book wasn't written. It was compiled. It's a collection of poems, songs, stories anecdotes, quotes and some smaller books all strung together to sort of make a narrative and central theme. It contradicts itself constantly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Sure, people have some agency over their religion, but it depends on several factors. If someone is a Christian and cherry picks and ignores parts of their book, they are a bit of a hypocrite. \n\nThis is from gallup: \"The AP VoteCast survey shows that 81% of White evangelical Protestant voters went for Trump this year, compared with 18% who voted for Biden. The Edison exit polls estimate that 76% of White evangelicals voted for Trump, 24% for Biden.\" \n\nNow let's check in with the Bible, shall we? \n\n\u201cTruly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\u201d Matthew 19: 23-24 \n\nSome theists argue that 'the needle' was just the name of some gate, but seriously, how is this open for interpretation? Jesus was a poor carpenter's son. He walked around in rags and spent time with lepers. He wasn't rich and when he walked into the temple and trashed the place when the accountants set up shop it only reinforces this quote. Hypocrites are only part of the problem. Every republican is a hypocritical Christians, but when the non hypocrites vote for them they're also being hypocrites.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*edited to fix formatting because the fancy pants editor is terrible.",

In case anyone's still reading--\n\nAll of the anti-LGBTQ and anti-choice legislation in this country is being pushed by the \"[Alliance Defending Freedom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Defending_Freedom)\". \n\nThey are behind every case most people have heard of, including the vigilante abortion law in Texas. The gay wedding cake case. The opposition to LGBTQ+ marriage. The Hobby Lobby contraception case. They literally want trans people sterilized and have fought for that in a human rights court. They want gay sex criminalized. \n\nThey ghostwrite bills, send them to GOP governors, and then use their specially trained lawyers to argue the bills they wrote in court. They created the [Blackstone Legal Fellowship](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone_Legal_Fellowship) to train lawyers to further their specific goal of turning the US into a christian theocracy. \n\nIn 2014, Blackstone Legal Fellowship's website used to say this--\n\n\"Alliance Defending Freedom seeks to recover the robust Christendomic theology of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th centuries. This is catholic, universal orthodoxy and it is desperately crucial for cultural renewal. Christians must strive to build glorious cultural cathedrals, rather than shanty tin sheds.\u201d\n\n[Everyone needs to know about them](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom). They literally want to take us back not 100 years, but one thousand.\n\nAmy Coney Barrett is one of their own. She taught constitutional law through a heavily Christian lens at Blackstone. She's been a paid speaker at their conferences. Now she's on the Supreme Court for life. \n\nThey're coming for all contraception next. Blackstone's website boasts that they win 80% of their cases.",

Or really, anyone who pissed them off, which was mostly everyone, bc they're the most judgemental ppl I've ever known.\n\nThey did buy me expensive guilt gifts during holidays, though. I mean, that makes up for the horrible beatings, right? In their minds it does, bc they've complained over the years how much they spoiled me as a kid. That's why I didn't turn out to be the adult they wanted. Nevermind that I'm a far more moral person without their Christianity. Seriously, my father is the kind of person who would not shed a tear if suddenly every person of color or foreigner dropped dead tomorrow. My mom thinks Bill Gates should be shot, because he's helping Africans instead of Americans. Meanwhile, I try to live my life not judging others, not being racist or homophobic or sexist or xenophobic. But hey, they're gonna go to heaven when they die, since they're such good christians.\n\nI think I would've liked to take my chances with atheist parents.",

They're expensive AF, slow AF, and the birth parents have far, far too much say in the end result.  Literally the only reason to go with private adoptions is if you're picky about the child and want one from a racial and/or religious background similar to yours or if you're a birth parent who wants to place someone with parents who are of a similar racial or religious background to yours.\n\nState systems don't discriminate on any other basis than ability to provide a suitable home for foster placements, and even some of the ones they approve are sketchy at best because there's so few people willing to foster-to-adopt.  I think the main reason people are turned off from it is that not every foster-to-adopt situation becomes and adoption.  I can understand why that would be heartbreaking, but it shouldn't be a dealbreaker.\n\nI am friends with a non-religious gay couple who have adopted two children through the foster system and are fostering-to-adopt a third.  They're great dads and even this highly conservative and religious state I live in (Utah) is more than willing to place children with them.  It's far cheaper than paying tens of thousands for a private adoption.  Hell - you even get paid by the state while fostering and waiting for the adoption to finalize!\n\nThe entire private adoption industry exists because it's one of the few exceptions where public accommodations are allowed to discriminate on any basis they want.",

At no point was my religion/faith questioned and/or brought up in the adoption process with exception to an initial form. However, my wife and I did submit a request to adopt a set of 3 siblings (1 child was half black and half white, the other 2 children were both white) and we were told they want a mixed couple to adopt these children.\n\nWhen you show interest into adopting a child in the state, a NIBS (non identifying background summary) is issued to you. This provides everything that DHR knows about the child(ren). Of the 30+ I read, roughly 20%-30% of them stated that a non-religious house hold would be required to place the child in.\n\nAlabama has a heavy presence from the Southern Baptist Convention in the adoption atmosphere, but if anything, I was turned away more for being a white religious male than I ever have in any other aspect of my life.\n\nI'm not saying that Mrs. Browning's experience is untrue, but I know the state system does not discriminate against non-religious. If anything, there is a request of more POC and/or non-religious families per capita than the opposite situation.\n\nDisclaimer: My wife and I adopted a teenager. As they are the ones who are being abandoned by the system, so I imagine there is less pickiness in these ranks.\n\nNot that I have to, but I can provide proof.\n\nThank you all for your time.",

They even say that if the birth mother's could have seen what this couple could offer to the child, they may change their mind. \n\nI wouldn't say they have it out for atheists, just trying to accommodate the birth mother's request.

If it has some personal info on it, you should probably block that out (blur, black rectangles).  And don't forget to read the image rules on /r/atheism before posting.\n \n * if it's a special Facebook page, you can just mention its name and remind users to use the inner Facebook search engine\n\n * if it's a discussion, you can take a screenshot (and color out or blur names and faces) and upload it to some image file hosting website...  or you can copy/paste the text content\n\n * if it's a video, try looking for a copy of that video on some other website, like YouTube, it may already be posted.

Whether you agree or disagree, it helps to at least start a discussion from an understanding of that other position.\n\nThey believe that each person has an immortal soul and that certain things are necessary to achieve that souls calling. By placing a child in a home where they are assured of not getting those things, the agency has failed that child gravely.\n\nIt's akin to someone being placed with an addict to non religious people - entirely self defeating. Sure, a home is a home, but that child would be a serious disadvantage and have a difficult road to reaching their full potential in that situation. \n\nTo the religious crowd, failing to account for the child's eternal soul is the gravest of failures in the placement process.\n\nAs I said, disagreement is expected. But you're not going to get anywhere by disrespecting their opinions and beliefs.",
