  "text": "Christians want to make abortion and gay marriage illegal, but not divorce. This is strange because the bible openly condemns divorce (Matt. 19:9), but not the other two. Looks like another example of Christians being themselves by picking and choosing what sins to ignore and what ones to condemn.\nJesus condemned divorce, the only allowable exception being in cases of adultery. [He even went further and condemned lusting after women as committing adultery.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:27-28&version=NKJV) In the Old Testament, people caught committing adultery were stoned to death. \n\nYet on this sin, there's nothing but complete Christian silence.  There's no sign of Christian protests at courthouses, Christians assassinating divorce lawyers or even Christians advocating stoning of divorcees. \n\nJust *crickets chirping.*\n\nThis sounds like good old-fashioned Christian bigotry. Christians pick and choose what \"sins\" to condemn out of hatred for minorities, which only serves to \"other\" and marginalize them further. This makes Christianity a predatory religion that thrives on persecuting the vulnerable and defenseless.",

A disobedient woman would be punished not like a *person*, but in the same way that a disobedient dog or goat would be punished. \n\nTheir understanding of \"sex\" was something which required a man to stick his penis into somebody else, so it simply never occurred to them that \"sex\" even **could** take place in the absence of a penis. As such, there is no mention of lesbians anywhere in the Old Testament. \n\nThe authors of the New Testament *do* take time to condemn women who \"leave their natural use\" as sex objects for men, which is the closest anywhere in the Bible gets to mentioning lesbians (And, presumably, also asexuals. And even straight women who don't want to experience marital rape).",

The idea is to get women out of the workplace, out of higher education. \n\nOnce they are out of the workplace men can use marriage as a cudgel since they would be the ones with the money. The reason they want to keep gays out of marriage, is because it fosters the idea that marriage is a state thing and not a religious thing. They need marriage to be considered religious...*Then*, to weaponize marriage against women they will outlaw divorce so women have no choice and no way out (this is essentially where it was in 1930). \n\nAfter that they take women's vote. Then take women's right to own stuff. \n\nAfter that they will come up with reasons for why slavery makes sense. And why choosing who their kids marry makes sense.",

The history of no-fault divorce is little taught, but is far from non-controversial. It is definitely on their agenda.\n\nWant to see why they don't put it front and center in their legal analysis? Go look up a case called Dycus v. Dycus. It's the story of a guy making every constitutional argument he can half-imagine against no-fault divorce and getting positively wrecked in court.

We can't even get Christians to agree on a common moral code.\n\nThat's why abortion should be legal, as well as drugs, alcohol and any other \"immoral\" thing, as long as it results in the least harm. Because the law shouldn't be used to impose a certain moral code. If abortion is illegal, a lot of women will try to get abortions in unsanitary conditions, and we will have a lot of unwanted children that nobody will want to take care of. Making drugs illegal is  making procuring drugs very dangerous, the drugs themselves might be impure, and a lot of people who need help are getting thrown in jail, which only makes everything worse.",

It makes no sense to say \"but I think you really are just making a biblical argument\" as your one and only counter point to that.\n\nJust for example, one of the MAJOR groups that wants abortion illegal are Catholics. They are not even vaguely close to biblical literalists. They accept the big bang theory, and evolution. And yet, they still want abortion illegal, because they feel it is a moral argument. \n\nYou can't just be like 'The bible is a bad argument\" when the other side isn't using the bible as their argument just because they tend to be religious.\n\nThe same is true of gay marriage. Possibly the biggest opponent to gay marriage is the Roman Catholic Church. \n\nThe same group which published\n\n> The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church in 1993. \n\n>In it, the commission warned of the danger of fundamentalism, which does not accept any systematic approach to interpretation:\n\n>\u201cFundamentalist interpretation starts from the principle that the Bible, being the word of God, inspired and free from error, should be read and interpreted literally in all its details. But by \"literal interpretation\" it understands a naively literalist interpretation, one, that is to say, which excludes every effort at understanding the Bible that takes account of its historical origins and development\u2026 The fundamentalist approach is dangerous, for it is attractive to people who look to the Bible for ready answers to the problems of life. It can deceive these people, offering them interpretations that are pious but illusory, instead of telling them that the Bible does not necessarily contain an immediate answer to each and every problem\u2026 Fundamentalism actually invites people to a kind of intellectual suicide. It injects into life a false certitude, for it unwittingly confuses the divine substance of the biblical message with what are in fact its human limitations.\u201d\n\nI would say the VAST majority of \"Christians\" in the world hold this view of the bible. \n\nThey recognize it's a human document, with a history of editing, and a history of political motivations, and \"for the times\" type rules - like not to eat shellfish. \n\nYou are effectively straw man arguing them and it is not an good route to take.",

Some may honestly believe divorce and many other less consequential things are undesirable, but not as grave or consequential as the murder of fetus endowed with an innocent human soul. That's why it is entirely possible for one to attend an openly gay-friendly church run by a gay pastor, and still be against abortion. It doesn't have to make sense to you, just to them.\n\nSame with the argument about caring about the baby but then not wanting to provide welfare. If you believe human souls should not be murdered AND you believe parents should be primarily responsible for raising and feeding their children, not society, then that may just be how you roll, even as the rest of us shake our heads and our jaws drop.\n\nSheesh. Let's be more logical about our atheism. Some hypocrisy is inherent in everyone. We ourselves know the climate change will destroy our civilization, but we're still going about our daily lives as if not, right?\n\nYeah, yeah.

The Church of England (henry's church) doesn't and most protestant  and reformed churches don't really condemn divorces at all period. but i think they don't really encourage it either. Just keeps it as an open option just in case if a couple need to be separated. however christians protestants and reformists typically emphasize love above all things so this is why typically you don't see many christians getting divorced under a protestant or reformed framework.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nand of course originally divorces had to be approved by the pope back in the medieval times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso it all really works out in the end for the christians and divorce and they choose to ignore it as not  being a primary concern of theirs.",

Many fundamentalist churches tell young people that any man and any woman can have a successful marriage if they are both strong in the faith.  There is a tremendous pressure to marry inside their religion.  Another factor is that young people want to have sex.  They are under tremendous pressure to remain abstinate.  Engagements can be amazingly short because they want to have sex.\n\nThen the evangelical couple is under pressure to start pumping out babies.  The couple barely knows each other when the first kid arrives.\n\nAtheists have more freedom to take their time.  They have fewer social restrictions on who they can marry.  They can take the time to find someone they are compatible with and get to really know the person.",

If a politician or their spouse filed for divorce the politician would just announce they were not running for reelection.  There was no point in even trying to get elected if you had been divorced.  The first political campaign I worked in was in 1970.  There was a joke running around the campaign headquarters about a politician whos first wife died of eating poisoned mushrooms.  His second wife died of a tragic fall down a flight of stairs.  His second wife didn't like mushrooms.  \n\nAll that changed with Ronald Reagan.  He was divorced, but the Evangelicals fell in line behind him when their leaders told them to.  That opened the floodgates.  Before you knew it even ministers in the Evangelical movement were getting divorced, often marrying much younger women soon after the ink was dry on the divorce papers.  As you go down the list of televangelists and religious college presidents it almost seems like being divorced is a job qualification.",

A woman could divorce her husband if he became physically repugnant to her or changed careers to one that meant he would stink all the time (tanners was a huge one there). \n\n2- Jesus only spoke out against divorce AT THAT TIME because it had become a common scam for men to marry a girl, take her dowery (usually an amount her parents had struggled to save up for years) then suddenly make up a reason to send her back to her parents w/out the dowery. And since she was unlikely to find another good match w/out that dowery, AND she was being plunked back into her parents hands as another mouth to feed (which was absolutely no joke back in those times) she would be shamed and blamed for failing to captivate her husband properly. So it truly WAS \u201cout of the hardness of his heart\u201d to do that.",

However, I'm fluent in Hebrew, so I can at least note that Gay Sex, Divorce, and Abortion are each referenced at least once in the old testament.\n\nBefore you read on, I believe that if God exists he/she/whatever is an asshole.  Onto the references:\n\nGay Sex:\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by \"bible\" but at least the old testament is very much not at all fine with gay men, it actually says we ought to stone to death any man who lies with another man... (Leviticus, 18, 22).\n\nAbortion:\n\nAs for abortion, the old testament is nearly silent on the matter. The understanding of the single reference to abortion is a fetus is the same as any of the women's body parts, and therefore if someone hurts a pregnant woman and causes a miscarriage, they do not **need** to kill the offender. (Exodus, 21, 22 to 25)\n\nEdit: In Hebrew the word \u05d4\u05e4\u05dc\u05d4 refers to both miscarriages and abortions. The main sources to the Jewish prohibition on abortion comes from later Jewish texts such as the Talmud (if I'm not wrong, those do not hold much value in Christianity). According to Jewish scholars, Exodus 21, 22 to 25, does refer to abortions. There's still an argument ongoing about the subject, but the only allowance on abortion in Judaism is to save the woman's life.\n\nDivorce:\n\nAs for divorce, the old testament refers to it specifically, both in Isaiah and Deuteronomy. Specifically in Deuteronomy 24, 1. It says that if a man marries a woman he doesn't like, he can pretty much tell her to leave and he's in the clear...",

Without an increasing population businesses will see decreases in consumption and workers will have more value/power over employers because there will be more jobs than workers",

      "text": "There's little in common between the three issues really. As you correctly pointed out, there's a pretty big exception clause for divorce - adultery. It would make little to no sense for christians to call for divorce to be illegal, while the exception is present.   \nThe issue of abortion is a pretty fundamental one that is hard to navigate because they consider the fetus to be alive. To those who truly believe this, trying to present a case for abortion is no different to trying to present a case for killing a 5 year old. It's a hard thing to agree to disagree on.  \nThe issue of gay marriage is the most obvious for bigotry. Even if it could be argued that Christians shouldn't be in gay relationships, there's no clear reason why they should be attempting to impose that prohibition onto others.",
