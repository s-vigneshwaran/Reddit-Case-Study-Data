Back when the movie came out, there was this official website that talked about how \"unobtanium\" was a room temperature superconductor that they couldn't find a way to manufacture and so the only way to get it was to set up this interstellar mining project, the most expensive thing ever done by humans, and gather it for Earth's energy needs. I can't find the site anymore but I'm pretty sure it explained that the term started as a joke but caught on later.\n\nThe actual movie itself didn't do very much explaining about it, but there's hints everywhere. The flying mountains fly because they're full of superconducting \"unobtainium\" that is flux-pinned in the moon's magnetic field, and the rest of the rock eroded away leaving them stuck there. If it was possible for superconducting material to form naturally on a planet with such a high magnetic field strength, it might be actually possible for such flying islands to exist",
