  "text": "TIFU - Posting on Reddit about our sex life with CBAT and now our relationship has ended\nOk this exploded more than I expected, and has been a bit overwhelming with the messages but thought I\u2019d give an update. \n\nThe attention hasn\u2019t been exactly positive and this hasn\u2019t been the best thing to happen for my relationship and it\u2019s now sadly ended. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect it to blow up so much, I should of used an anonymous name instead of my real name and our real ages. \n\nThere aren\u2019t many 25 year old Tyler Life\u2019s who are in a relationship with their s/o for 2 years who is 20.\n\nUnfortunately her younger sister recognised this and showed her parents who wasn\u2019t happy at all and made the situation extremely awkward. \n\nWhat made it more awkward, and cemented the fact that it was me, is that they recognised the song. Once at a family dinner we were discussing music tastes and my ex girlfriend stated that I have an odd taste in music. Everyone laughed and pressed me to play something from my phone of what I like as music, to which I then blessed their ears with CBAT.\n\nHer father laughed and said it was terrible, I guess we all have different tastes. Although I nodded in agreement at the time, I was thinking in my head that this is a great fucking song. \n\nWe are over now and I am moving on. I already revealed my face on tiktok, but with the amount of hate I originally got I decided to say I didn\u2019t have it and backtracked.\n\nI don\u2019t think the song is that bad and I had no idea she didn\u2019t like it until recently and as soon as I did I stopped. I didn\u2019t force her CBAT, not all can handle CBAT, I know it\u2019s different. \n\nI know a lot have asked for face reveal and playlist. My playlist I actually burned onto a CD and have been using my CD player. But I\u2019ll go on YouTube and try link all the songs in one playlist and share. \n\nTL;DR Made Reddit post and finished our relationship",

It is thus ambiguous.\n\nHe did say that the girlfriend could recognize that he was still thrusting to the beat in his head, suggesting it was the rhythm of the actual melody, which is distinctive and not a consistent rate. However, the tempo is slow enough that thrusting to the underlying beat would still probably be distinctive.",

The melody is the part of the song that strays from the beat, usually is picked or individual notes, that uses more movement and aims to be front and center really. This is mostly melody.\n\nI mean honestly... the song isn't bad, its just not good in the context he used it lol. Not all songs work with all moods, I love some heavier metal but I don't think I would ever play it for sex lol. Tool in particular would be... really bad lol, it uses crazy amounts of time signatures that change and go async from the beat. Would be so disorienting.",

Better now than having her realize nothing's going to change when you're married with kids.\n\nTwo years is a very long time to never read her body language, never ask for feedback, never let her pick the music,  thrusting away robotically to get what you want and never worrying about what she wants. There's clearly much more to the issue than unsexy music, so don't let that be the only take away from this experience. You have an opportunity here to very publicly and embarrassingly learn something about yourself and be a better partner in the future.",

I don't even begin to know how you feel.\n\nGood news is, is that you are young and you have plenty of dating years ahead of you.\n\nYou could turn this into an explorative experience if you decide to make this part of your life public. This all originated with wanted to become better at sex.  This could be your open window to exploring that and allowing others to read your journey.\n\nThe big lesson from this is communication.  The best sex in the world requires honest communication between partners.  Finding out what works for you and what works for her.  Thats a big conversation to have because it is something so intimate and each person is worried about hurting the feelings of another.  Due to the overwhelmingly negative response to the song choice, I would take that as sound advice to not use in the bedroom further.\n\nWe all wish you well.",

I can't imagine that rhythm being pleasurable or sexy. Why not just learn from your partner's reactions?\n\n- Left long ago anyway - if you needed the same music in order to have sex after 2 years I would be so so sick of the playlist by now. Did you ever ask if she liked it? I hate having music on during sex.\n\nYou have learned a valuable thing. Sex is not all about you and your needs, and I find it hard to believe your ex put up with this for 2 weeks let alone 2 years.\n\nIf this is real, I'm afraid you have taken the wrong lesson away from this. This is not about her hating your jizz anthem, it's just that you've been so oblivious to the fact that playing this song every time you have sex was an awful idea, and if you're this oblivious in the rest of your relationship then no wonder she got fed up.",

Now the song is all over TikTok, there are literally music theorists out there trying to analyze the song to see how you actually thrust to this song.

Being a music person it's important that whomever I date is also a music person, and that there's a significant overlap in taste.

For any future partners/encounters, don't play CBAT, and if you do decide to play other songs, point blank ask if the music kills the vibe. \n\nAlso, if a partner says your music taste is \"interesting\" or \"different\" or \"weird/odd\" what she really means is she doesn't like it at ALL and it's a turn-off, but she doesn't wanna yuck your yum.

This is what happens when people \"research\" women instead of just communicating with their partners and treating them like a normal human being.\n\n\"I looked up the instructions to the vulva and if I press these buttons in this order it will program her orgasm. Damn, I'm a great lover aren't I.\"\n\nI think all of my cis women friends (and myself) have had the experience of being told what we should/will enjoy in bed with someone who 'researched it' with great confidence. That, or \"well this worked on someone else, so it has to work on you.\"\n\nPro tip to everyone regardless of gender or sex/anatomy: Absolutely make sure you're sexually educated, I don't want to discourage that kind of research, but you can't \"research\" what your partner will like. You have to talk to them. Everyone is different, and what everyone likes is different. Knowing what one person likes, or what google says people like, is not indicative of what someone else likes because they are *different people*. And if you find yourself treating everyone of some gender like they're the same...that's something to take a step back from maybe.  \n\n\nEdit; Obligatory \"If this is real\" because yes this is Reddit. But also, the advice stands because there are people who have this mentality when it comes to sex.",

I think moving forward you should do the same, make a lengthy Playlist, so you can easily press \"next\" if she's not feeling it. Try to make the songs more sexy and sensual, CBAT is a dope ass song if your drinking, or partying with friends, I dont find it to be particularly sexy/sensual in any sort of way",

With sex being a fluid thing I don't understand how you can just maintain the same tempo and pace and expect someone to cum. \n\nI feel like you were given awful advice. Whoever told you that matching the rhythm and tempo during sex has clearly never had sex a day in their life. Period.\nMO\nWhat we have here is a failure to communicate on both parts. Firstly, on her for not saying something sooner and waiting a whole two years. Letting that stuff bottle up cannot be good. Second, on you for not asking her if playing music was okay and for not letting her not check your songs beforehand. Sometimes this stuff needs to be discussed and planned out. I for one can say my girlfriend and I have never had music in the bedroom. I get distracted easily and it's just a mood killer if I'm not focused. \n\nAlso I listened to the song......and the Playlist. I just can't see those as songs you'd have sex to. \n\nBut take it as a learning opportunity. Take this time to reflect on the good and the bad. Focus on what you can do to improve and when the next relationship comes along you'll be ready.",
