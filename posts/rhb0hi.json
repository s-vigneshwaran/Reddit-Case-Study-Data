They are essentially trying to compete by labeling male strengths as weaknesses.\n2. other women, for different reasons, are really bad at selecting their mating partners. These kinds of women over and over again pick deadbeats, heathens, abusers, or 'thugs' who are listless, irresponsible, or unmotivated.\n\nIn the first example 'toxic masculinity' is weaponized for female power, in the second its a manipulation tactic - to avoid personal accountability on their own part.",
