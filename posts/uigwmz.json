  "text": "The Satanic Temple plans to use the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) to ensure its members can still perform religious abortion rituals with Mifepristone and Misoprostol, even in states that completely ban abortion access. They will also possibly open religious abortion facilities.\n> The news that Roe v Wade will likely be overturned is extremely distressing. The Satanic Temple (TST) has nevertheless positioned itself to protect religious abortion access for our members.\n>\n> In States that continue to provide abortion services, we will continue to take steps, including legal action, to ensure our members do not have to endure hindrances to immediate access. That includes waiting periods and unnecessary medical procedures. In addition, we will continue to demand that states do not require medical practitioners to withhold medical information or that patients are not forced to bury or cremate fetal remains. Lastly, in states that require mandatory abortion counseling documents, we are providing our own counseling, which we are demanding be recognized by states as a valid alternative.\n> \n> In states that outlaw abortion but grant exceptions for instances of incest and rape, then consistent with the Supreme Court's ruling in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, TST members should be permitted a religious exception to perform TST\u2019s religious abortion ritual. We will likely have to sue those states to affirm our civil rights, but the law is clearly on our side. You can read about our current lawsuits here: https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/legal-action.\n> \n> States that outlaw abortion and do not grant exceptions present more significant challenges, but TST has a number of plans that we will be undertaking quite soon. First, we will be suing the FDA to permit TST access to Mifepristone and Misoprostol for use under medical supervision as part of our religious abortion ritual. This request is being made under Federal RFRA. Unfettered access to these drugs would be a considerable step toward enabling TST to perform our abortion ritual without government interference. Again, the law is clearly on our side, but we are gearing up for a legal battle.\n>\n> Lastly, TST is researching the possibility of creating religious abortion facilities. We will provide more information about this plan as it develops.",

I would count PR stunts to be social actions when it comes to these guys.\n\nWhat you want is legal action, the FFRF (Freedom From Religion Foundation), is closer to what you want since they do lawsuits. So they do need money to beat all of those church funded Richards. Praise be to the FFRF, suing those we literally can't afford to sue.\n\nEdit: Calling them Richards, I am referring to the nickname while staying classy you know.",

I don't expect real results of social actions to show for decades, and instead allow the next generation or the one after to enjoy the fruits of that labour. Least if we're talking about a macro scale.\n\nIf you want fast results we have to take it to court and force the reality, or hammer it into law. Even then it's hard to say the full effects of that due to resistance. We legalized same sex marriage, and people still fight against it.\n\nSeriously, think the FFRF is what you want, same with the ACLU.

He also organized these acts in a way where the people he engaged in the acts (think the protestors) had fun doing it which helps sustain the actions. I think that the TST is taking a few chapters from his play book and doing quite well raising awareness of the issues AND fighting back.",

Hopefully the Satanic Temple in all it's sarcastic poetic vengeance will be the resting champion upon the hill.",

While I'm 100% in support of separation of church and state, and don't believe any govt building should fly religious flags of any kind, in this instance the state had made a flag pole available to the community: \"any\" group could apply to have there flag flown and multiple groups have in the past without issue.\n\nAs a result, the pole was deemed *not* government speech, but a community resource/speech, and therefore the state had no right to deny a specific religious organization the right to fly their flag when they allowed other communities to fly - essentially, they have to allow all or none.\n\nSure, if the state tries to deny the Satanists application, they've got grounds to sue, but that's unlikely considering it's the same case the state just lost to the church, unless the city has already implemented policy changes/requirements for using that flagpole.",

You have to prove that it's a bonafide religious practice. And that doesn't involve simply proclaiming it or having membership cards, you have to show a historical pattern of this religion practicing it. Given that the Satanic Temple is less than 10 years old, they'd likely run into a lot of problems. \n\nThere's some examples of religions being genuinely exempt to laws (see certain Native American tribes can legally possess peyote, even though it's illegal) but these are rare.\n\nThe reason that they've won on things like displays in public is because there's pretty well established law that says that governments can't pick and choose which religions to allow displays, but getting something that is otherwise illegal to become legal is a way, way, way higher barrier.",

Smith a law of general applicability that is otherwise valid doesn\u2019t need to cede grounds for religious exceptions. People see the Satanic Temple suing over something and start cheering \u201cYeah! Take that religious hypocrites!\u201d But many (not all) of their lawsuits that people cheer on are clearly frivolous to people actually familiar with the law. The reference to Fulton v. City of Philadelphia is a prime example. Philly\u2019s Commissioner of Human Services was allowed to make arbitrary and discretionary decisions regarding what adoption agencies to work with, so when she decided not to work with Catholic Social Services because of their religiously-motivated adoption policies, it was not a law of general applicability. A blanket, and preferably statutory, ban on working with adoption agencies that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation would be, and then it would have been a different issue for the Court. A ban on all abortions but for cases of rape and incest is a generally applicable law - it applies equally to members of all religions,\nas opposed to, say, a law that only allowed women to get abortions if your pastor grants approval. The fact that it only allows abortion in some cases doesn\u2019t make any less generally applicable in the Smith sense - Smith is about applicability regardless of religion, not applicability regardless of prior conditions. If that\u2019s unclear, in the Smith case a man was denied unemployment after he was fired because he was an Indian who used Peyote religiously. What I\u2019m saying is that the prohibition of peyote usage wouldn\u2019t have been any less a generally applicable law if marijuana had been legal, which is what the Satanic Temple is suggesting. \n\nThis is completely frivolous and when they inevitably lose people are going to exclaim how this is evidence of religious and judicial hypocrisy when actually it\u2019s just the Satanic Temple either deliberately or stupidly misstating the law.",

Though the various tests have changed over time, it has never been a case in this entire country that the government cannot absolutely interfere in religious rituals.\n\nThe current precedent for the Free Exercise Clause is from the Smith case. To restrict a religious practice, the government has to show a) the law is neutral, b) generally applicable and c) not motivated by animus to religion.\n\n>If you believe that, today, the law supports your interpretation, then since your interpretation is the one which goes against the plain, commensense reading of the law, I feel that the burden of proof is on you.\n\nThe entire history of the US court system since the founding is my proof. Not a SINGLE court case, or legal precedent, has ever been set that favors your interpretation of an absolute ban.\n\n>Meanwhile, Missouri's Supreme Court struck down abortion requirements on freedom of religion grounds:\n\nFalse. First: this wasn't a First Amendment case. What actually happened is the case was thrown out during summary judgement because the TST made a real shit argument. They said their members could not be compelled to view an ultrasound. The state simply argued that they never were: the MO law merely stated they had to be given an opportunity to view it and decline. Legally, the TST lost this case. They presented an argument that wasn't even relevant, and the court threw it out. Kinda goes to my general point about the TST's legal chops.\n\n> Here's a Supreme Court ruling allowing animal sacrifice:\n\nAssuming this is the Lukimi v case, they applied the Smith test I mentioned at the top of this comment. The court HAD TO APPLY A TEST.\n\n>One where they ruled that state law on schooling could be exempted for religious purposes:\n\nDuring this case SCOTUS evaluated the pre-Smith criteria. The court HAD TO APPLY A TEST.\n\n>A case that blocks them from banning even the KKK from engaging in religious ritual\n\nThis wasn't a Free Exercise case. This was an Establishment Clause case.\n\n>Allowing the use of illegal drugs\n\nNot even a First Amendment case. This was a Federal RFRA case, which mandated a strict scrutiny test. Precedent doesn't apply to State abortion restrictions.\n\n>Most of these were under the Religious Freedon Restoration Act:\n\nAll you did was link to the RFRA. The Federal RFRA is not relevant to State abortion restrictions. Either way: not First Amendment.",

It is not something that can survive outside of it's current parasitic state.  \n\nBut since you seem to be taking a more religious viewpoint here (believing that a literal satan demands child sacrifices - for which I'd like to see some reference)... how about the bible? \n\n>After God formed man in Genesis 2:7, He \u201cbreathed into his nostrils the breath of life and it was then that the man became a living being\u201d. Although the man was fully formed by God in all respects, he was not a living being until after taking his first breath.\n\n>In Job 33:4, it states: \u201cThe spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.\u201d\n\n>Again, to quote Ezekiel 37:5&6, \u201cThus says the Lord God to these bones:   Behold, I will cause breath to enter you, and you shall live.   And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to come upon you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live; and you shall know that I am the Lord.\u201d\n\n>In Exodus 21:22 it states that if a man causes a woman to have a miscarriage, he shall be fined; however, if the woman dies then he will be put to death. It should be apparent from this that the aborted fetus is not considered a living human being since the resulting punishment for the abortion is nothing more than a fine;   it is not classified by the bible as a capital offense.",

Abortion after viability has never been legal outside of unusual circumstances.  (roe limited to 28 weeks, which was shortened in Casey - to 24, which was due to better knowledge of viability and improved neonatal care).",

I noticed it doesn't specifically reference \"wormwood\" so maybe it is intentionally not using that name in their interpretation?\n\n> Numbers 5:11-31, describes an unusual procedure, known as the jealousy offering, a husband could use to determine if his wife had been unfaithful to him. Essentially, the husband and wife would come to the priest, the priest would then create a concoction of unpleasant ingredients, and then the wife would have to drink the concoction. If the wife was guilty of adultery, she would get sick and her belly would swell. If the wife was innocent, God would protect her from the effects of the concoction. There was nothing magical about the concoction. It was entirely a matter of God using the result to demonstrate whether a woman was innocent or guilty. So, in summary, Numbers 5:11-31 affirms the truth of Numbers 32:23, \"Be sure your sin will find you out.\"\n\n> Some propose that Numbers 5:11-31 refers to God causing an abortion. The 2011 edition of the NIV mistakenly states that the drink will cause miscarriage in Numbers 5:21-22, 27. However, this is not what the passage is talking about. Pregnancy is nowhere mentioned, or even hinted at, in the text. The only thing that even sounds like pregnancy is the guilty wife\u2019s stomach becoming bloated, but even in that instance, it has nothing to do with pregnancy. Further, the passage does not say that drinking the concoction would cause an abortion/miscarriage. While drinking a poisonous mixture of ingredients could very well cause a miscarriage, that is not what this text is speaking of.\n\n> If a wife was found guilty, the punishment was death (Leviticus 20:10). If the wife was found innocent, she would be \u201ccleared of guilt\u201d and \u201cable to have children\u201d (Numbers 5:28). So, again, Numbers 5:11-31 does not refer to abortion in any sense. Rather, it is describing a method that God allowed to be used to determine if a wife had committed adultery against her husband.",

To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.\n\nV\n\nBeliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.\n\nVI\n\nPeople are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.\n\nVII\n\nEvery tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.",

So many of these right wingers are so tickled pink about putting \"Christian values\" in to schools and government, but if you told them ok well since Catholics are majority (if protestants are divided up by their specific flavors of Christianity) then we will let them decide everything since it would be way too complicated to have 100s of different Christian religions giving their two cents, and arguing, so majority will rule!  All the sudden they are going to be offended and pissed about it.  Which is exactly why of course there should be NO religions involved in the law making process but they are just too stupid and blinded by how certain they are that their flavor of Christianity is the only \"correct\" one and thus assume that it is the one they will be using to make laws and teach kids in school.  They can't see how stupid and dangerous the idea is and are going to be shocked when their little Timmy is learning to pray to the saints at school and not just being taught how to hate gays and creationism.",
