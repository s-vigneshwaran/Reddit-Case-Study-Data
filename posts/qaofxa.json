These are really made for professional use, specifically as monitors when mixing or on-stage. They're insanely accurate and fast, and are definitely not forgiving, they will make poorly mixed music sound worse. They have six balanced armatures inside them, each covering a specific range of frequencies. I do love em, if you're doing heavy sound mixing on the go, I would've recommended them to ya a few years ago.\n\nBut if you're just a normal ol' consumer, fuck headphones, if you're gonna spend thousands on audio get yourself a nice pair of speakers and a nice amplifier and DAC. Speakers will always be superior to headphones when it comes to quality of sound.",

                  "text": "This review on that set legit made me feel so sad for the parent who just wanted to get his son something nice:\n\n>\tI'll start off by saying I'm a middle aged dad who purchased this for my teenage son so that he would stop borrowing his sister's Beats for gaming. I was first expecting to pay $100, but was pleasantly surprised by the pricing and reviews for these.\n    I just now tested these, and to me, they don't seem too bad. The audio quality is lesser than the Beats he was using, but to me, that's OK. They are not as comfortable as the Beats either, but they're still fine for wearing for hours on end.\n    Unfortunately, they were not acceptable for my teenage son. This was just one gift of the many for his birthday. We tend to go overboard, even before Christmas. He wasn't overly thrilled, but used them immediately. Later, in a fit of rage over his other gifts, he shouts \"Thanks for the $10 scratchy headset Dad!\".\n    So, if you're a middle age person looking for good value, I think these are a good fit. Though, if you're a spoiled brat teenage boy who wants to hear what others will do to his mom in the best sound quality and comfortability, these may not be the best purchase.",

I don't have to worry about charge too much, since I'm barely ever out for more than ~2 hrs travel time.

I know more than a couple people who basically keep a power bank plugged into their phone any time they're out the house. And it still doesn't change that there are rarely any times that I can think of a person being out and about and therefore needing headphones, where audio quality is really gonna matter.\n\nBut, that said, if you got a link to a pair you'd recommend I know I'd keep it on the back burner and I'm sure someone else rolling by would appreciate it.",

Even the heavier compression applied by the earliest standards of bluetooth with very narrow bandwith, you would still be able to tell the difference between 5 dollar, 100 dollar, and 500 dollar headphones. Nowadays aptX gives you quality close to lossless transmission. Furthermore, if the codec of the audio file is supported by both the source and the sink then the audio can actually be transmitted *unaltered* through bluetooth, although this isn't always the case with all devices. An upgrade to better drivers and acoustic design is almost always more audible and perceptible than differences between highly conserved lossy formats and lossless formats.",

That has something to do with audio quality, but it is not an apples to apples comparison at all. Different codecs have wildly different bitrate because of different efficiencies of their algorithm. AptX actually allows for higher bit depth AND sampling rate than, for example a CD, which is considered a pretty good standard for high quality audio with the 1411 kbps bitrate you are talking about.\n\nThat \"EVERYTHING\" you are losing between the 1411 and 911 kbps is barely perceptible to dogs and bats, and is much less perceptible to humans. Basically, a different pair of headphones or even just some back ground noise in the recording/surroundings would negate the effects.",

And I have the WH-1000XM4s which cost twice as much, are not neutral, favour a more bass-heavy presentation, and lose out on soundstage/imaging like all noise cancelling headphones do.\n\nOne can prefer the sound of one to the other but it barely has to do with the \u201cmissing bits\u201d like that guy seems to think.",

You can actually loose parts of the song, with some high quality files.\n\nWith that said, bitrate probably isn't to blame. My theory is that even the noise canceling is so integrated now, that they have problems keeping the clock cycles stable with that much processing going on. It has to happen in real time, after all. The other option would be bad separation, not sure why that would be the case tho",

Sure, the best wired buds will always outperform the best wireless ones, but the best wireless buds will also blow the worst wired ones out of the water.\n\nIf I had to take a wild guess, I'd say that 2016 Apple earbuds are probably slightly better than base model Airpods and on the whole a bit worse than Airpods Pro.",

It's the protocol/standard, Bluetooth/WiFi is a standard and not a physical thing by itself.\n\nAn analogy to explain this would be language, it will never be a thing if nobody came to an agreement on a common standard, and without it, it's usually interpreted as gibberish.\n\nWiFi (the IEEE-802.11 standard) by design is meant to create a wireless local area network (WLAN), think ethernet cables to the router, but instead the cables are, well, wireless. Ultimately it's meant for communication between client devices and the router for your Internet stuff!\n\nBlueooth (used to be IEEE-802.15, but currently maintained by Bluetooth Special Interest Group) on the other hand, is meant to be an exclusively bilateral relationship. It's use-case is mainly to request a connection on a request-accept basis, what they want to do in-between is up to the drivers on either party. Though, there's a few protocol within the Bluetooth specification to allow for efficient AV streaming, but as we all know it's kind of poopy, and it's not going away soon though 5G seems to be aspiring to be the replacement for all things radio connected, but we'll see.",

What this means is that for each year the MP3 sits on your hard drive, it will lose roughly 12kbps, assuming you have SATA - it's about 15kbps on IDE, but only 7kbps on SCSI, due to rotational velocidensity. You don't want to know how much worse it is on CD-ROM or other optical media.\n\n\nI started collecting MP3s in about 2001, and if I try to play any of the tracks I downloaded back then, even the stuff I grabbed at 320kbps, they just sound like crap. The bass is terrible, the midrange\u2026well don\u2019t get me started. Some of those albums have degraded down to 32 or even 16kbps. FLAC rips from the same period still sound great, even if they weren\u2019t stored correctly, in a cool, dry place. Seriously, stick to FLAC, you may not be able to hear the difference now, but in a year or two, you\u2019ll be glad you did.",

Let\u2019s compare the sound quality of the much more expensive AirPods Pro to the same 2016 wired EarPods Apple used to ship with their phones. What makes the AirPods sound SO much better despite their Bluetooth medium is the in-ear design rather than the uncomfortable, always-falling-out, \u201cI can\u2019t hear my damn music because of background noise\u201d, design they used to have. So sure, there may be a MINIMAL loss at normal audio levels by using Bluetooth but the gain is so much better by using proper earbuds with an in-ear and ANC features. Plus, AirPods Pro are just so convenient for working out and don\u2019t fall out of your ear anywhere as often as other headphones",

It would be one thing if Bluetooth limited the bitrate to 128kbps or lower, which would be poor enough for most people to notice even with mediocre drivers, but thats just not the case anymore. The drivers and fit are going to play a much bigger role than connection 95% of the time. The main reason why Bluetooth headphones tend to be worse is that you have to sacrifice driver quality and other areas to include Bluetooth connectivity at a given price point.",

They don't have the clarity of KZ ATEs they're replacing, but the portability is worth the sacrifice in sound quality. Being able to watch videos on my phone while cooking or workingout without a cord getting in the way is pretty damn nice. If I want quality and don't need portability I just use my overears.",

Depending on the codec that the audio is encoded and decoded on the Bluetooth end greatly affects the quality of the audio over Bluetooth.\n\n99% of bluetooth headphones have just okay audio codex which is passable for almost all music especially on the go. If you want a high bit rate codec the only one I can think of that's an earbud I would look at the xm4's from Sony.\n\nI'm just going off the top of my head but I think the max bit rate for most earbuds are around 192 kbps and max out at like 320 kilobits per second and in the highest ranges using HD codecs you'll get one megabit per second but requires more power so you'll only really see them in over the ear headphones.",

Also, bluetooth was limited in bitrate more severely in the past, where gaussian frequency shift keying was the only encoding used but now DPSK solves that issue.\n\ndon't trust me, look it up and even better, derive the math yourself",

It's probably better with an expensive wireless headset like a SteelSeries, but I just went back to a nice quality wired headset for my home.

The radio waves in bluetooth are passing digital audio information, not analog, which is what wired headphones need. This is important because the digital signal is encoded whereas the analog signal is the actual raw continuous signal. Normally on your phone a chip converts the digital file to analog, and them amplifies it and sends it through your wired headphones. With bluetooth, a different, bluetooth specific chip reads and encodes the digital file into a bluetooth code called aptX and then sends it to your wireless headphones, which have another chip that can read the digital bluetooth code and then finally covert it into analog again to play through the actual speakers in the headphones. In the end, all of the signals need to be made into an analog signal to be played through any kind of speaker.",

Depending on the codec that the audio is encoded and decoded on the Bluetooth end greatly affects the quality of the audio over Bluetooth.\n\n99% of bluetooth headphones have just okay audio codex which is passable for almost all music especially on the go. If you want a high bit rate codec the only one I can think of that's an earbud I would look at the xm4's from Sony.\n\nI'm just going off the top of my head but I think the max bit rate for most earbuds are around 192 kbps and max out at like 320 kilobits per second and in the highest ranges using HD codecs you'll get one megabit per second but requires more power so you'll only really see them in over the ear headphones.",

However, the codecs themselves (aptX mostly) are quite processor intensive algorithms that are more efficient at compressing audio, so lower bit rate can sound equivalent to a higher bit rate mp3 for example. I found quite a few aptX headphones and earphones on amazon, and actually I use bluetooth ear hooks with my 2-pin iems when I workout/commute.",

However, most low-to-mid range wired headphones are not quality enough for it to make a difference. Further, most people are playing music off of something like a cell phone that has no high quality DAC/amp to take advantage of the possible sound quality improvement you might get with such a setup.\n\nFinally, even if they have high quality headphones, a dac, amp, etc.....they're probably streaming music with YouTube or Spotify or something, where it's *still* being compressed. You would need audio in a lossless format, which you probably don't, so it's all moot.\n\nThere are better audio arguments to be had. The aspect of charging vs. not having to charge. Open-ear headphones versus earbuds. Potential of hearing damage from headphones versus speakers. But most of these audio quality arguments just don't apply to streaming music while you're on the go.",
