  "text": "TIFU: By slapping my wife\u2019s ass\nLast night my wife and I were getting hot and heavy, and began having sex. During sex, I decided to put in a little spanking. \n\nThis is where things got weird.\n\nAs I slapped her ass in the heat of the moment, she bursts out with \u201cyes daddy, spank me harder!\u201d (To preface I knew she had some serious daddy issues)This initially was a turn on, but after a few seconds all I could think of was disciplining my daughter and my face went sour. I stopped immediately and felt awkward. She responded with \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong daddy, did you not punish me enough?\u201d\n\nI walked out of the room and told her I needed a minute. Now I don\u2019t think I can ever have sex again. \n\nTL;DR slapped my wife\u2019s ass, called me daddy, now I can only think about disciplining my daughter and don\u2019t know if I can ever have sex again\n\nEdit: so this my biggest post ever and it\u2019s about my wife calling me daddy\u2026 lord help me.\n\nAnyways, we talked about it and she was really embarrassed and I told her it just surprised me and I wasn\u2019t prepared. We agreed on sir \ud83d\ude09",

You walked out without saying a word and your wife is probably both confused and humiliated and I'm assuming you came here to post about it before even letting her know what was on your mind. If the initial turn on was not enough to blanket the dumb thoughts running through your mind, that's 100% okay, but you have to discuss this with her. Let her know you aren't into it and don't think you can do it going forward. Or maybe you discuss moving into it gradually or as others have suggested, using a different term entirely. The best outcome is the one where you two discuss it together, not with us on the internet.\n\nEdit: I know everyone hates these, but thank you to everyone. For your awards, and your comments, even all the ones who did not agree with me.These types of situations, I believe we can always agree to disagree and still be cordial with one another.\n\nI spoke to this as someone who's been from a similar situation and though I missed where he mentions saying he needs a minute, some things are time sensitive and you may just have to accept you need to work through your emotions with someone else rather than yourself. It sucks but that's life isn't it? Sometimes you don't get time. Anyway, I've rambled on far too long. Take it easy Reddit, I wish you all the best.",

Everyone dogpiling this guy because he needed to separate after being triggered by this violation. Everyone demanding that he, the victim of a violation of consent, was obligated to give an explanation to the person who violated that consent. \n\nFolks are assuming he violated it first with the unannounced spanking. There was nothing in his post that indicated this was the first time he has spanked her. People inferred based on him saying he decided to \u201cthrow it in\u201d, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it was the first time. \n\nAnd even if it was the first time and he violated consent by doing it, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s allowed to react by dissociating when she does something without consent and it triggers incredibly uncomfortable thoughts. He has a right to separate if that\u2019s what he needs in the moment. They\u2019ve now talked about it. \n\nSo yeah, I suppose I care a lot about conversations around consent, and so many people here missed some important stuff. Judging by the downvotes to me pointing it out, I\u2019ve made a lot of them uncomfortable. Not shocking in a society where people fuck up consent all the time, even when it\u2019s not consciously done.\n\nSorry if all this consent talk makes you uncomfortable.

Often in sexual experiences you get \"lost\", it could have just slipped out. If anything it sounds like she saw it in porn or something. She didn't shove a dildo up his ass unannounced. She said one word. Not even a typically bad word. \n\nI worked at the rape crisis center for 3 years and have been raped by two different men. You're out of your depth here. Your intentions are good but you're devaluing what consent is to make an argument on a reddit post that has obviously personally offended you. You're making a mockery of the idea, not strengthening it.",

I know. I\u2019ve talked to rapists who use this exact tactic. \n\nObviously that gets pretty far away from the specifics of this post about a husband and wife, but any chance I get to tell people they need to be explicit with all things regarding sexual consent, I\u2019m gonna take it. \n\nI know that my stance will not lead to more rapes. I know that your stance will. \n\nYou have no clue what depth I can swim in. Imagine the arrogance it took for you to think otherwise.\n\nOh, and you can keep declaring that I\u2019m offended. Doesn\u2019t make it so. I like to educate. You may be projecting your own fragility onto me. May be something you need to look at.",

A number of comments on here are from people saying that they hate being spanked and would be pissed if their partner did that without asking first. \n\nIf I wanted to I could easily downplay getting called \"daddy\" and say that he's a baby for being so effected by it, but that too would be wrong. \n\nSpanking, being called daddy, these are both things that are turn ons for some, turn offs for others, and meaningless to some 3rd group.

If you can express to your partner what you are aren't ok with then you aren't ready for sex. Sex requires communication, you should be willing to share that with your partner before getting too frisky. I think OP was in the wrong for just straight up spanking her and they hadn't discussed it first. I like to be spanked, but not by surprise. My bf and I discuss that activity before we do it. It doesn't have to be awkward or non sexy either, there are ways to intertwine those discussions into foreplay.\n\nI will say that for pure vanilla sex you probably don't have to discuss much, but communication is still king. You should still be making an effort to make sure your partner is comfortable and enjoying themselves (this goes for all parties, gender and number of partners be damned) or else how do you know everyone is having a good time? Anything outside of that should be discussed, preferably sober and not during the acts. It comes down to basic empathy and caring about your partner and their pleasure and comfort.",

If it was a hookup, then no bc there\u2019s no trust idgaf. But you do not walk out on your spouse like a 10 year old with a tantrum without saying shit. And you wanna say it\u2019s bc I\u2019m insecure in my relationship and don\u2019t have trust\u2026 I would never date someone who shows so clearly how little respect they have for a relationship like OP does\u2026. And, again, a good partner doesn\u2019t do that\u2026. Or any mature adult so wtf",

I said you\u2019re dramatic because you think this instance has done irreparable, irreconcilable harm to the trust. You think that this trust can never be rebuilt. I think that\u2019s pretty dramatic. And it also seems indicative of the fragility of your own trust and your own ability and willingness to repair trust.",

Individual humans at that. We're all going to experience things differently every second of our lives. What someone may see as no big deal, may be an incredibly huge thing to someone else. There aren't many things out there that have an absolute point one way or the other, good or bad, black or white. Sometimes a singular point in time is all it takes to ruin something good. He's hurt but she's humiliated. It all went terribly wrong and all it takes to fix is just to take a second with each other and talk about it. \n\nAgain, I'm sorry for your pain. I've been there, and still struggle with it sometimes, my last partner used me because they were lonely. I thought the whole time it meant something and we were gonna be able to communicate our issues and get back together because the whole reason we separated was dumb anyway, caused by a like of open discussion on both sides. But no, they were lonely and bored and knew I'd bite. So they got their rocks off, said they'd call and then never did.

Being called daddy is 1) not indicative of father-related issues, 2) doesn't have to do jack crap for you if it works for your partner.  If that word bothers him that much, like you mentioned above, find a suitable replacement like papi or master.",

You don't get to say he's an asshole for feeling uncomfortable during sex and wanting to be on his own.\n\nShit for her? Absolutely. But why should he have to sacrifice his own comfort and wellbeing to prioritise hers. Nobody's mental wellbeing is more important than another's, but his required him to be alone and hers with someone else which aren't compatible. Whilst he can be alone and her call someone else of she wishes, he cannot simultaneously comfort her and be alone.\n\nIf the roles were reversed and she left as soon as he spanked her the entire comment section would still be saying he was an asshole and should sit alone and think about what he did. Don't lie and pretend it wouldn't. He's being blamed for prioritising his emotions and mental health rather than sacrificing them fro his partner and I think that's ridiculous.",

She's just as emotionally confused and vulnerable right now but here he is on Reddit telling us the story instead of telling her he didn't like it or what his thought process or feelings are.

But *in this situation*, it's an asshole move.   \n\nWe all do asshole things from time to time, but the difference is knowing when it would cause serious problems for others involved.  This couple may be laughing at how this issue has blown up, or maybe not.  In my experience, walking out on your partner in life \"to take a moment\" is far worse than staying and immediately working it through with her, whatever it might be.\n\nAnd again, each marriage is different and that may be the way this couple deals with adversity - and that's none of my business.

I do hope that OP and his wife have since talked about it but I can tell you, his reaction is a million times better than a partner of mine would have gotten.    \n\nThat said, even if things are discussed beforehand, reality can be quite different than 'in theory'.

Countries have banned the practice outright. I do not intend to ever spank my child. \n\nI think that feeling weird about touching parts of the body that are sometimes sexual is problematic and a symptom of American purity culture. Bodies are sexual when you make them sexual. Butts are just butts unless you make it about more. Allowing weirdness around \"oh I touched a butt\" propagates shame and has significant negative ramifications including but not limited to people avoiding healthcare because they are paranoid about being touched even non-sexually.",

This is also ignoring the fact that words can have multiple uses in different contexts. It is why women will call their other friends who are women \u201cgirlfriends\u201d while their significant other will also call that same woman their girlfriend, why couples call each other \u201cbaby\u201d without being actual infants, or even why submissive people call their sexual partners \u201cmaster\u201d without literally being their slave.. There are many examples to choose from that disprove, or at the very least contradict, this statement.\n\n>\tAdults being consenting or not has absolutely nothing to do with that\n\nI do find it interesting your insistence on ignoring this very important part of my point, however.

This is a very bizarre hang-up. It is not like you can force other people to perform sexually only in ways you approve of, especially when there are so many other kinks one can think of to have an actual issue or disgust towards, and what people say during sex without you being present has zero impact on you or your life whatsoever.",

Using them for another purpose, within the culture that already has a widespread use, creates an undeniable relationship between the two meanings. Calling your sexual partner \"daddy\" and your father \"daddy\" relates the two and the *desire* to use that specific word, when it already has a meaning, speaks to something about that person and their relationship with he first meaning. Sex is not an isolated part of someone's identity, what a person's sexual preferences are speaks to them as a whole person, not just a sexual one.\n\n\"Baby\" is the same thing, the choice to use the term for an infant, for your spouse, means something about the person and that relationship.\n\n> submissive people call their sexual partners \u201cmaster\u201d without literally being their slave\n\nBut the choice relates to the concept of slavery in a way that speaks to who they are and their relationship with thier partner. The desires aren't benign parts of identity, they are active and meaningful.\n\n>I do find it interesting your insistence on ignoring this very important part of my point, however. And, again, I disagree that this has nothing to do with the topic. \n\nIt doesn't in the context of words already having meanings. I haven't seen you actually explain why it's meaningful in that context and suspect there are things about it you're simply assuming without stating them.\n\n>Also, many people have *never* even referred to their own fathers as \u201cdaddy\u201d in the first place.

So how did you come to this conclusion about me? Why did you assume this and is it misinforming your other thoughts on what I'm saying about this topic?\n\n>what people say during sex without you being present has zero impact on you or your life whatsoever.\n\nSexuality is part of who we are, how we vote, what ideals we hold, what our morals are, how we act, what we think, what we value and who we value. How does it affect me or you? Because people affect me and you. What they do and think and feel and act affects you and me. Sexuality is not any more benign than religion or who one prays to or whether you support public funds for pride parades or a drag events or laws concerning consent and sexual assault.\n\nJust because *you* don't notice how it affects people doesn't mean it doesn't, it just means you're blind to it.",

Well sure, they are saplings at some point and saplings take special care but it's important to remember that sapling will be a full size tree.

Bonus points: give them an alternative action. For example, your three year old bites. Instead of hitting them or giving them a time out, ask them if they\u2019re biting because they\u2019re upset, bored, etc. Then tell them something like \u201cI\u2019m not going to let you bite your sibling/me/that spoon, but you can bite this pencil or piece of cloth when you feel like that\u201d. Positive experiences in childhood last forever the rest of your life. Communication is vital at every stage in life, so teach it to your kinda young",

Don\u2019t lay your hands on another person unless it\u2019s in self defense.

Encourage good, calm, behaviour afterwards.  \n\n\n\nI mean, adults also have trouble regulating strong emotions. You for instance beat your kids when you feel powerless and get angry. Kids have way way more trouble regulating strong emotions and they experience way larger moodswings. \n\n\nWould it help you if every time you got angry, or sad, and acted emotional you got beaten? Probably not. You've  learned over time to compose yourself and not let your emotions take over. As does everyone when growing up, including kids who don't get beaten. Especially those in fact. \n\n\nAnyways, I'm assuming you're noticing that your kids still have tantrums so it's not even helping. It *can't* because tantrums aren't a thing they're consciously deciding to have. Especially if you're not teaching them any way to deal with them except pushing them down out of fear for you, a fear that will hopefully never be big enough to actually keep them from anything or else it'd be horrible. \n\n\n\nI'm reminded of the saying that punishing a crime with a fine just means you can do it if you're willing to pay. Your kids know that tantrum means getting a light beating. When their emotions are up they are willing to accept that as the 'cost' of acting out their emotions. Just like adults will accept higher risks of negative consequences if they're angry or hurt. Have you ever said anything terse out of anger or annoyance? Same thing. Only you don't get beaten for it, you get to calm down and apologize for it later. \n\n\nBy putting a price on tantrums you've just made it a valid option. They can have a tantrum if they're willing to pay the price. You're also not encouraging or enabling better behaviour. You're also making a connection between emotions and physical violence and pain. All of which only promote tantrums because people are wired to want to act out physically when overemotional anyway, some people hurt themselves when angry/sad, some throw things, some yell or stomp, some hurt others, you've just made that the official way to deal and are even willing to do the hurting for them.\n\n\nSo yeah, stop beating your kids. It's not helping them. In fact, if your kids are ever confronted by the cops in a high stake situation you're just training them to act out and have the cops punish them afterwards. As you're teaching them that acting out is okay if you accept punishment afterwards. Only problem being the kind of punishment the cops deal out is huge and perhaps permanent.",

His problem wasn't with mixing up letters but it was with mixing up orders of thought processes.  As in, if he were given driving directions, the order he would follow the directions would change.

I wonder if people learning English as a second language get freaked out upon finding that we use the same word for our romantic partners that we use to describe small children. Like who came up with it and why did it catch on? I\u2019m sure if tomorrow you started calling your partner \u201cinfant\u201d while having sex with them they\u2019d be like \u201chey hold up no thanks literally cannot think of a worse thing for you to call me right now\u201d.

Master or sir work too, but that\u2019s more of a formal title that most people have no personal association with and is usually associated with  BDSM.\n\nDaddy is head of the household (traditionally, and that\u2019s outdated now). In more modern times, just think of it as the man of the house. Traditionally the wife/mother also refers to her husband as daddy in front of the kids. So \u201cfuck me, daddy\u201d or \u201cspank me, daddy\u201d is coming from an unrelated adult intimate partner who\u2019s not role playing as anyone else (daughter or otherwise) who is sexually turned on by her husband/partner as a nurturer/provider/protector/disciplinarian. This can also be the case if you don\u2019t have kids (or pets, or plants) to take care of but exhibit any of those characteristics in life or toward/around your partner (or role play them).\n\nNone of that has anything to do with incest.\n\nI\u2019ll give you an example: my ex first started calling me daddy around her cat who I would take good care of when we lived together. I would also be very protective of her and she felt very safe around me. The more she kept calling me daddy to the cat combined with our sexual dynamic made me think she would be into that as a kink and I could see us building up to it even though she didn\u2019t realize it consciously. So one day in bed is said \u201cyeah, you like that big daddy dick\u201d and she immediately came HARD. We talked about why that was a turn on for both of us, and it was the reasons I listed above even though it was a huge surprise to her, and it had nothing to do with incest. She has a great relationship with her father. I\u2019m nothing like him. I don\u2019t have incest fantasies and neither does she. \n\nIt\u2019s a word associated with being the man of the house and a nurturer/provider/protector/disciplinarian type of authority figure.",

If you were cool with the whole idea of dominance just try having her say stuff to imply she is yours to have fun with and what not, it is the same dependency idea but without the daddy little girl thing and kinda dips your toes into it for later if you start to feel comfortable with the whole thing. It isn't even necessarily that you have to pretend to be her dad or something, just being able to keep the mood while she says stuff like that. Letting her do her own mental thing goes a long way and will make her side of sex feel more fulfilling and fun; which will make your side of sex a lot more fun and fulfilling too. Nothing like knowing you just made your partner cum 10 times",

Mine is that you said they're putting words in your mouth when all they were doing was asking you to clarify what your stance was. Asking someone to clarify something isn't bad debate, although not giving straight answers sure is. You seem to equate asking someone to clarify their stance with accusing someone of a negative stance. \n\nEven in this made up example, I never mentioned standing in the restaurant and shouting \"they have rats in the kitchen\", cause as you said, there's no proof, and you don't want to accuse someone of something that isn't true. Instead, I said you simply asked them, \"are you saying you have rats in your kitchen?\" \n\nAsking someone to clarify isn't accusing them of anything, it's giving them a chance to clear it up so there isn't a misunderstanding. Even if they're heavily implying that they think you're guilty of something, if they're giving you the chance to clear it up, that's a good thing. \n\nIt sucks to be accused of being an abuser when you aren't, I've been there, but don't answer all cryptic and hostile, clear that shit up. If they don't believe you, then that sucks even more and hopefully other people will speak up for you, but you can't blame them for getting the wrong idea when you're not even trying to correct it.",

I get it, it's hard to recognize that your caregivers were abusers. We like to put people in boxes, and the abuser box is the same box we throw monsters, and nazis, the velociraptors from Jurassic Park. Our first inclination is to say, my dad was not a monster, therefore he could not be an abuser. The fact that he became verbally abusive later is just more proof of this\n\nBut that's flawed thinking. Your dad was spanked by someone who was spanked by someone who was spanked. It was traditional, and common, but that does not mean it's okay, nor does it mean that at any level, it didn't affect them emotionally and mentally. I'd encourage you to step out of the anecdotal sphere of reasoning that your comments are trapped in and for an hour, ignore that voice that relates spanking to yourself, and just read the research. Look up a few the hundreds of studies that prove spanking is harmful. I'd suggest the comprehensive 50 year study they did where they tracked kid's lives after the culture of spanking and saw the long term effects.",

It can be right when defending one\u2019s self or others, and it can sometimes be understandable as a reaction to verbal or physical abuse. But to use violence to teach a child a lesson instead teaches them that violence is permissible to be used as a teaching agent. \n\nCan children learn lessons from violence? Sure. But what is far more likely is that they will learn to accept fear from their parents as a normal part of life. That can create trauma which may stay with them for their whole lives. Moreover, you\u2019re risking your child exercising violence against others when you exercise violence against them. \n\nIn many ways, violence is a societal disease. When you use it against an innocent child, you normalize it for them, and ensure that another generation grows up believing violence to be okay.",

But being squicked by that term doesn't mean spanking and power play cannot be a part of your repertoire).",

If you aren't fulfilling it she may find someone who does. Being a life partner you want to do what you can to address all of her desires at home (within reasonable accommodations). It's the dominance she's after and other phrases like \"sir\" or \"alpha\" are good substitution for \"daddy\".

I understand that sometimes nothing else will work but, most of the time other methods are far more effective and then you don't ruin kinky sex for yourself, possibly? Either that or, just go ahead and communicate what happened in the gentlest most matter of fact manner possible, ask that your wife no longer refer to you as daddy during sex, even if spanked. Problem solved!\n\nEdit to add: yes I've gone thru many parenting courses and I'm well versed on many methods. I strongly believe (via example provided by my children at times) that this is sometimes necessary as nothing else will get any attention but mostly rely on redirection and other, more positive reinforcing measures before resorting to this. My marriage counselor agrees wholeheartedly, where I get very negative reactions in general from some of my extended family, mainly those working in facilities with people with developmental disabilities. I understand their objections because someone developmentally incapable of understanding or correlating that pop on the butt as if I don't do ___ then ___ won't happen is what they work with professionally every single day so those situations you'd NEVER apply this method and it would be called cruel and inhumane.",

We still made out and did other foreplay type of shit, but any chances of actually fucking immediately went out the window the second the word \u201cdaddy\u201d left her lips. It\u2019s different since she\u2019s your wife and you obviously need to talk to her about it, but I 100% understand the feeling of it almost ruining sex completely. One of my exes sometimes called me daddy to fuck around and that wasn\u2019t as bad because she was obviously teasing me and I knew we both didn\u2019t like it. It still made me cringe even if she did it in an over exaggerated, obviously jokey tone. If she ever said it during sex, honestly that might\u2019ve been a deal breaker",

When she spoke of her Father she used only that word. Never dad or daddy. She only used those words in private with him. \n\nIt took a little time but defining the words and separating them cleared up the issue. \n\nIt's clear your wife wants to be more kinky with you. Run with it. You're not a child molester because she calls you Daddy. Just relax. Enjoy being her rock, care taker, protection and more. That was once her dad/father's role. When you married her you became her her Daddy. Her father stepped back and gave her to you to teach, guide, protect and care for. \n\nLet it go. \nYou got this. \nYou're overthinking it. \n\nHope that helps",

I never used it, then one night my best friend (f) changed it to a dd/lg. I will let you Google that. You will not believe the number of younger women who have fantasies about getting raped by their father. I corresponded with enough of them to develop an archetype, their parents all got divorced just prior or during them going into puberty, they all had a slightly bigger body frame, they all had very large breasts. Basically girls who I think blamed themselves for their parents divorce by going into puberty or something. At first it was kind of a turn on when thinking about it in an abstract kind of way, but once you started to think about it in more concrete terms it became kind of icky and strange. In a way I felt guilty for perpetuating these fantasies and closed the account.",

Sounds like the \u201cDaddy issues\u201d thing is just projecting.\n\nHe should do the research and talk to his wife before doing things like this in the bedroom, especially given that he assumes she has some past trauma with men.",

My wife is Latina and the idea of Latina women calling their partners \u201cPapi\u201d is really sexualized and I fell for it until we got together and she was like \u201c that\u2019s what I call my dad, no way I would call you that in a sexy way\u201d and my mind was blown. It\u2019s like \u201cduh\u201d? That makes total sense but it didn\u2019t really dawn on me until she spelled it out. Especially now having a daughter there\u2019s no way in heck I want to be called \u201cPapi\u201d or \u201cdaddy\u201d in a sexual nature. \n\nThen again? Not trying to \u201ckink shame\u201d but it seems like a large percent of porn videos on leading tube sites feature a ton of family related porn of some kind so clearly someone is being turned on by the thought of being sexual with a family member.",

If your wife is REALLY into it, there\u2019s no real reason why you shouldn\u2019t do this type of role play. \n\nJust take some time to dissociate the role play from the experience of disciplining your daughter. I\u2019ve never had to do that before as I don\u2019t have children. But, if you really love pleasing your wife, then this is something you have to deal with.",
