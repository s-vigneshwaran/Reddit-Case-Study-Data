However, he ONLY TOLD ME, and wrote nothing down about it in my records (it was a \"wait and see\" for the operation).  Turned out to not be that secondary issue and, other than my deductible, my insurance covered my entire $40,000 surgery.  Had it been the other issue, it would have turned into a $150,000 surgery, but my doctor's plan for that possibility was to explain to my insurance that it was an emergency procedure, which they would have covered it.\n\nThat's what I found so bizarre.  If we tell the insurance it might be something different BEFORE the surgery, they won't cover it.  However, if it pops up unannounced, it becomes an emergency and is covered 100%.  What's the point of this stupid dance we have to do in order to have our legitimate health issues paid for?  The system is beyond broken, it's tyrannical.",

A worker doing what\u2019s best for the company is only gonna be blamed on the person who told the worker how to do that. That person could just say that that\u2019s how the business works, that they simply told their workers how the business works. And every employer encourages their employers to do what\u2019s best for the company so what\u2019s the big deal?",

I've worked in the insurance industry for 20 years. Their goal isn't to save people's lives -- not even close. It's to return the highest possible profit for their shareholders. The only way to fix this is single-payer healthcare.\n\nA capitalist system for healthcare is absolutely impossible: there is an extreme imbalance of knowledge, necessity, and availability. You cannot be an educated consumer when A) you don't have the decade of medical school to understand what is necessary and what is not, B) your actual life hinges on getting the \"product\", and C) you may not have other options available (particularly in rural areas).",

I'm just trying to explain why it is profitable and why it would be difficult to do something about... kinda like a dig in tick.\n\nYou pay providers a premium so if you need an insurance payout they have money to pay out. This is the basis of insurance.\n\nThe problem this naturally generates is the stated goal of the company never lines up with the universal goal of a company: make money. Why? Simple, the more they pay out the less they profit.\n\nSo this sets up a fight from the get go, and money always wins a moral fight when it comes to business. So the insurance companies do whatever they can to avoid paying out while raising rates and trimming features off plans to sell back to you as add ons.\n\nThe question here is \"who is left holding the bill at the end of the day?\" Well it's us, the customers, who get screwed over by this. They've made it so they get to make the call if it's covered or not, and made the rules around it so labyrinthian it's real hard to know if you're covered for whatever you're at the doctor's for that day.",

Go read the [Koch brothers sponsored paper on it](https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf).\n\nWhile you can say \"i dont think we need more taxes\" the fact is that you are either uninsured, not privately insured, or don't take a close enough look at what is coming out of your paycheck.\n\nThe cost of healthcare taken out of your paycheck is on average more than 15% of your take home amount. That is not including the premiums that your employer is paying on top of that. Even with an insanely high new tax to support it, lets say 10%, it would still end up putting money into your pocket. In reality, that number is closer to about 3%. You would directly be saving money with the new tax. Your employer would pay about $3,750 per employee a year, which is about 1/5th of what my company currently pays, So even corporations get more money in thier pocket.\n\nIn terms of government corruption / waste. It truely is a non-issue with something like this. Referring back to the koch paper, government corruption would need to be triple the cost of the entire program (which they already accounted for in the paper..) in order to cost more than the current system.",

It kind of sucks because you love your doc, he saved you money and provided you care but he could totally be sued and lose his license over this. The other story about about the \"asshole doctor\" who insisted on listing the condition, is just doing their job and telling the truth. This is why insurance in America is so flawed. It's forcing doctors into treatments or situations that are unethical. And then when they play by the insurance rules I'm sure they get lovely one star reviews by patients pissed about crippling medical debt.",

He was just doing what he does normally. But they assumed malice when the doctor meant none, because they wanted someone to blame. \n\n\nOr maybe the doctor hated this dude and cackled and said, \"Fuck this guy, gonna make sure he's on the hook for this whole surgery, which means I probably won't get paid, heh heh heh!\"",

The solution is simple; don't be poor. Welcome to the USA.\n\nedit:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concierge_medicine\n\nFor the record, I signed up with a retainer doc about 3 years ago and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I still have normal private insurance, but the quality of care and just convenience of not having to deal with the bullshit and run around and obviously false diagnoses has been a godsend to me. The healthcare system was making me pull my hair out every time I had to deal with it, couldn't take it anymore. Worth every cent.",

If a hospital performs a 200k surgery on someone, chances are an individual person can't pat that. They need the insurance to cover it or they don't get paid. Hospitals are in the business of making money.\n\nEdit:\n\nOPs comment and the comments in this thread are discussing doctors at hospitals not the doctors that work for insurance companies. Doctors at insurance companies want to save the insurance company money and come up with reasons for procedures to be denied. Doctors for hospitals don't do that and that is who we are talking about. I'm sure most people understand that insurance companies employee doctors, but it is irrelevant to this conversation.",

About 10% of all deaths in the US are caused by medical errors.  Easily preventable careless mistakes are killing hundreds of thousands of Americans every year. That's \"healthcare\" in the US for you. Honestly if I'm being frank, it often seems like it does a better job of making healthy people sick and sick people dead. Literally the less interaction a person has with the US's healthcare system the better off they are. That's not some kind of hyperbole, that's an empirical fact.

Mistakes that just kinda fuck you up a bit don't really qualify. A good example would be an error where someone gives a big dose of heparin to a person who just got out of surgery, resulting in severe internal bleeding at the incisions and sutures and potentially death. \n\nAnecdotal evidence of how tough malpractice suits can be to pursue. My father had really bad car accident when I was in my teen years. His foot is more or less held together with screws and pins at this point and he lost significant mobility in his foot and leg due to the surgery and pain. \n\nIt got so bad because the radiologist/physician originally said there were no breaks or severe enough damage that needed surgery to repair and then cleared him for PT like 2 weeks after the accident. So he went to PT as ordered by the doctor. For 3 or 4 months he kept telling them he was in incrutiating pain and it wasn't getting better only worse. They finally did another scan and realized his foot was still very broken and incorrectly healing at that point since it was never properly set or even put in a cast. They had him in one of those walking boots when all of the ligaments in his foot were shredded and several bones were snapped.\n\nThey went in and did the surgery to repair it, but he still has life long pain and reduced usage because of the fucked up healing in some spots. He talked with a malpractice lawyer who basically told him his case would be incredibly difficult, because he more or less still had use of his foot. He gets to live with pain and severely impaired use of his foot, like he can't run for example because it just doesn't bend that way anymore, for the rest of his life and it's not enough for a malpractice suit.",

They'll collect after the spouse has passed and children have grown.\n\nRegarding the original commenter, it sounds like his mother's estate will be insolvent, the estate will be liquidated, the executor will pay what they're able to for the funeral, then pay secured loans, then unsecured loans, and finally any deferred debts like medical if there's anything left. OP won't be on the hook for the debt after the estate is declared insolvent and there's nothing left to sell, but they'll sell your family videos if there's a loan to pay.",

                      "text": "Not at all! I represented several insurance companies back in the 90s, and they are all about the money. Period. One insurance company would fire any claim representative if they found that the rep was going to law school, because the company were so afraid the former employee would use their insider knowledge against the company. And, of course, that was a very rational fear because I knew at least one claim rep who was doing exactly that. \ud83e\udd23 Good for him!\n\nBut people also allow themselves to get suckered by insurance companies because the public really has little or no idea how insurance policies work. I am always astounded by how many lawyers do not seem to have ever read an insurance policy. \n\nThe civil legal system is run on insurance company money, even though one of the first rules of interpreting an insurance policy is that any ambiguity is construed against the party that drafted the agreement - obviously, that\u2019s the insurance company. Those policies are then reviewed by state insurance boards, which are supposed to disallow any policies that are too obviously rip-off schemes. \n\nBut many that I would consider a rip-off are still sold and advertised on national television commercials \u2014 they are making huge profits when they can afford a Super Bowl ad! \n\nBut can you tell me exactly what AFLAC insures? No you cannot. I have no idea what event or situation an AFLAC policy is supposed to insure against. Even Consumer Reports said they didn\u2019t understand the policies. Yet people buy them because Nick Saban advertises them in humorous commercials. \n\nExample #2: NEVER buy any life insurance policy except a term life policy from a reputable company with AAA ratings. A 20-year level term policy is a good idea when you have kids (the premium is guaranteed to remain the same for 20 years). Anything else is a rip-off. \n\nYet I know judges \u2014 sitting judges \u2014 who have bought other policies and even they ended up as plaintiffs against the insurance company in one case. Explaining to a judge how he got ripped off by an insurance company is \u2026 well, highly entertaining, honestly. And it was because he bought something he didn\u2019t understand, and he didn\u2019t understand it simply because it was too good to be true and he failed to question if this was a legitimate and realistic offer.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit like joining a cult and then complaining that your life was stolen. Of course it was, because that was the entire purpose of starting a cult in the first place. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude44 The fact that people fail to recognize the dangers before entering into a cult or a contract is \u2014 to a certain extent \u2014 their own fault, and unfortunately, ALL of us have to learn this the hard way. And this applies to folks rich and poor, educated and ignorant. See, for example, the Bernie Madoff scandal: if it\u2019s too good to be true, it\u2019s a rip-off.",

Two big parties are allowed to run for major offices with any chance of winning. Both of them are owned and run by private lobbyists, such as insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, big banks, etc. It's essentially legal bribery, as the politicians that serve them get cush millions-paying deals (jobs, \"contacts\", etc) after they leave office.\n\nThe majority of the people who get votes are company lobbyists, corporate attorneys, and celebrities. \n\nThe political system has gerrymandered districts and destroyed the public education system to make sure that it doesn't change. It just gradually gets more corrupt. Politics in the U.S. is treated like college sports -- everybody roots for their teams and spews propaganda while ignoring the uselessness and corruption of their team.\n\nOne team (literal fascists now) is \"worse\" than the other, which guarantees that the people who are educated/ethical enough to resist the worst of the evils always choose a lesser evil out of fear. So nothing changes, except for the stupidity and corruption, which continue to slide toward Idiocracy.\n\nNow the media is for-profit and mostly propaganda, the world is facing ecological collapse and no one is prepared to face it, and even our \"entertainment\" is mostly focused on a hopeless, cynical form of nihilism, ensnaring in a net of pathetic babyish nostalgia many of the dreamers who still have enough imagination to do something meaningful.\n\nChanging things for the better looks simple on paper. But, in the real world, how?",

Again non-profit but we do need to keep the lights on and keep people people paid (and there are a lot of people involved in getting you those qtips).\n\nJust putting this out there as an example that our system doesn't need to be this bad even when you aren't talking about universal healthcare (although that would obviously also help)",

I had some tests done and everything was okay. \n\nOver the next few months I started getting calls from places saying I owed them money and I didn't know why or from where or when. The hospital charged my insurance, but since I had to do a blood draw, an MRI, and an ultrasound, they charged it to my insurance but it went through four different companies for payments. All from procedures at the same place. \n\nThe hardest part is when you don't have the money at that moment and it's in collections. I've explained to them that I don't make enough, save up some money to make a payment, and now all of a sudden they passed my case off to another collections agency. How are you supposed to keep up?

This is also including a hemotologist who supposedly cant diagnose me but can give me an expensive blood test and tell me hes not worried. My blood platelet count dipped and kept getting lower between 2017 to present day. \n\nOh and get this, they treat me like im not taking my health seriously. I live in texas, the state where the minimum wage is still the federal minimum wage, $7.25\n\nThey will do ANYTHING to milk more money from patients as much as possible, including making patients take costly test after costly test, and then act like they can't do anything because they're just smol beans. \n\nNone of my doctors have given me medication to make my platelet count go up either. So if my platelet count goes even lower, I'm going to need to eventually go to the ER to have a blood transfusion, or worse, I could get owned by simply falling once and bleeding to death. \n\nOh and by the way, I'm uninsured, and not because I want to be uninsured, but simply because I can't afford it. \n\nDid I forget to mention that healthcare in America is top tier, 10/10 would do it again, and that actually, I do love it?",

As much as we bash healthcare in the US, one of the things that we got right was not refusing emergency treatment.  While we don't have universal healthcare, homeless people end up in hospitals all the time.  Part of your $500 box of Q-tips, along with lining the pocket of insurance companies, goes towards paying for the bad debt of these people who have to use the emergency room as some sort of doctors visit.\n\nThe funny thing is that if we were to have universal healthcare, costs would likely decrease because more people could afford preventative visits instead of waiting for their infected wound to go septic.",

I was making significantly less than that as I was a full time student and only working part time basically making enough for food. It took me over a year to get my hospital bills waived and countless hours and visits to various organizations which I was told I was required to visit, take time off from school/work to wait for hours, wasting entire days, only to be told they can't help me and I shouldn't be there. I had to provide years of bank statements, tax information, enrollment information, etc. After all that I was harassed for years by collection agencies threatening me with warrants and jail time. \n\nSo yea.. if he didn't have the go fund me he could most likely get some/most of it waived. But I highly doubt the hospital / or their insurance company, whoever covers those waived fees, is just going to ignore the $500k gofundme campaign.",

Or even \nyour own money. Are you also going to argue that the restaurant owner or grocery store is denying your right to life \nby not giving you meals or food for free?  Why not argue the world owes you everything for free to keep you alive?\n\n>they take away your pursuit of happiness by denying you a living wage; there's certainly more than enough money \n> to go around with these record profits, but corporations deny their workers the fruits of their labor and thus the \n> ability to pursue their own happiness. The government is not protecting this right.\n\nAgain, you have a twisted version of what that phrase means.   Again, you have a twisted version of what that phrase means.   \n\nAnd no one is *denying* you a living wage.  If one employer isn't *offering* a wage you like, apply for a job with a different \none who will.  If none will, or you don't like the other terms of employment, start your own business like those \nemployers did and many others are.  Stop being a little baby and demanding that the world make life easy \nfor you. Again, are you going to argue that the world owes you everything for free so you can be happy?\n\n>Additionally, the US has the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, totaling over 20% of the prison \n>population worldwide despite being less than 5% of the world's population.

Additionally, if you cannot post bail, then you're held in a jail until \n> your court date despite the presumption of innocence. \n\nI agree that there are injustices in the legal system, and that there are some activities such as prostitution or drug use \nthat should not be crimes (but you should be responsible for any harm those activities or the results of those activities \ncause others).  That all should be fixed, for sure.  But the numbers you throw out aren't really descriptive of what's\ngoing on.  Just like the supposed Wage Gap, numbers can be misleading.  What if U.S. citizens are simply much more \ncriminally active than those of other countries?  What if the U.S. justice system is simply much more effective than that\nin other countries?  I'm not arguing those are actually true, just that boiling it all down to simple percentages is not \nat all useful.  Liberty means that U.S. citizens are free to determine the course of their lives. We are not owned by anyone, \nnor forced to live in a certain place, nor work a certain job, nor marry a certain person, etc.  If it's not all hunky dory,\nflowers, and unicorns, that's just tough - it's not the government's responsibility to do anything about it.

      "text": "So, I'm in group therapy for debilitating anxiety I've developed, and this concept is something others have talked about alarmingly frequently without actually talking about it, and I've always followed it up with my personal take. \n\nThey say something along the lines of \"I feel like I can't trust anyone, like everyone is just going to use me to help themselves.\" and also something like \"It's not that I want to die, it's like I just don't want to live.\"\n\nYeah, while that isn't *uniquely* American, it is **incredibly** prevalent here. America is one of the most depressed countries in the world. That isn't because everyone here just has some bad brain chemistry, it's environmental. It's the same reason why you feel like everyone is just going to take advantage of you - because this country doesn't allow you to make mistakes or slip at all, and at the end of the day it's that tired cliche of \"bootstraps\" - despite not being able to fucking afford boots anymore. One medical accident and you could be in debt forever. Choose the \"wrong\" degree and the same outcome applies. \n\nOur jobs don't offer proper protections/securities, nor guarantees of pay raises - so you need to work yourself to the bone or be absolutely cut-throat with coworkers and taking credit. Either that or you need to basically con people into buying something they don't need, inserting yourself as some sort of middle-man in a supply chain, or create some sort of bullshit thing that doesn't actually do anything for anyone besides maybe distract them from the fact they hate their lives just as much as you do. \n\nWe have a culture that views asking for help or support means that you're \"weak\" or \"lazy\" - and many of those in older brainwashed generations, as well as those who brainwashed them, just gaslight you by telling you to stop \"being lazy and asking for handouts\" or *really* date their brainwashing by telling you to \"stop acting like a commie.\" \n\nWe're over worked, under paid, told from birth that we have to prioritize ourselves because everyone else is going to do the same, told to not follow our passions or interests because they won't pay the bills, chastised for having basic empathy for our neighbors and wanting basic human rights - then if we *do* manage to do what they tell us to and achieve that \"American dream\" - we're left feeling empty and like a piece of shit because 9/10 it required us to give up on things we cared about, lose or neglect people we cared about, and live a life we didn't want to fucking live - and that somehow makes us \"free.\"\n\nThen when we interact with each other in day-to-day life and people ask how we're doing we all say the same tired lie of \"living the dream\" as if we're not just trying to convince them but convince ourselves. No. We aren't. We *really* fucking aren't. As [Malcolm X put it:](https://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/blackspeech/mx.html)\n\n> \"When we open our eyes today\u00a0and look around America, we see America not through the eyes of someone who has enjoyed the fruits of Americanism. We see America through the eyes of someone who has been the victim of Americanism. We don't see any American dream. We've experienced only the American nightmare. We haven't benefited from America's democracy. We've only suffered from America's hypocrisy. And the generation that's coming up now can see it. And are not afraid to say it.\"\n\nThat was 58 fucking years ago. What the fuck has *actually* changed?\n\nIn my opinion, all civil rights did was diversify the elite class and change our system of exploitation from one focused on race, to one focused on class. Yes - racism and discrimination are still very prevalent, but the system we have today focuses on punishing you for being poor and gives plausible deniability for individuals of power within it to punish you for being someone of color. With money equaling free speech in our government, the rich have more votes than you; and when you do your best to organize and be active - they just gerrymander your voting power away from you. The parties play a charade of giving a shit and opposing each other when at the end of the day they're just the different faces of the same fucking coin. \n\nThis country puts a fucking boot on your neck while you're barely treading water, then tells you to step on the heads of the people struggling just as much as you in order to stay afloat. They know that they can not take their boot off of you - and civil rights taught them that. When MLK Jr got assassinated and we had [a week of fucking riots across the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_assassination_riots), the president himself knew what the fuck was going on:\n\n> \"What did you expect?\u00a0I don't know why we're so surprised. When you put your foot on a man's neck and hold him down for three hundred years, and then you let him up, what's he going to do? He's going to knock your block off.\"\n\nSo now, here we are popping pills for the mental disorders we've developed due to this artifical and arbitrarily difficult environment, sitting in a fucking circle and asking someone to help us \"healthily cope\" with the environment we're being subjected to instead of demanding the environment change - **because we've become so conditioned and indoctrinated by it that we've gotten to the point of gaslighting ourselves into thinking that** ***we're*** **the thing that needs to change because we \"can't change\" the environment we're subjected to.**\n\nWhat the actual fuck.",

Insurance companies are just privately owned companies that perform collective bargaining and payment for its benefactors (and take very profitable returns).  Your only healthcare you \"pay for\" is your deductibles and contributions on visits/procedures...and that is a small fraction of what you and your employer actually paying.\n\nThe main argument for single payer is that by replacing dozens of insurance companies, which are for profit model, to one larger \"insurance\" they posses more leverage for collective bargaining therefore lowering overall costs.\n\nI'm not in favor of socialism as a system, nor am I necessarily in support for Medicare for all or other proposed single payer healthcare, but your argument makes you sound very ignorant and easily dismiss-able.",

I've seen thousands and thousands forgiven from patient after patient. Before you declare bankruptcy or start a GoFundMe, try calling the billing department. They usually have no interest in dragging payments out of someone who lives in poverty. \n\n1) Ask for an itemized bill before you pay a single cent \n\n2) Tell them you need financial assistance \n\n3) Use the words \"charity care\" or \"charity case\"\n\n4) Negotiate a small payment plan. If you can only afford to pay $30 a month, request that as a payment plan. Many times, if you're making consistent payments, even though small, they will wipe the remainder of your debt after a while.",

Some of them were terrifyingly stupid, like the guy who had a significant cardiac incident and went to the nearest medical provider (who also happened to wave a goddamn flag in their parking lot for his insurance company) then found out that he owed $90k at the end of his healthcare experience.  I got it entirely waived with a single letter - that's not even *me*, it's the fact that medical providers aren't actually trying to crush people, they're trying to heal people, but it's expensive.\n\nThe biggest problem in the propaganda war is probably the bankruptcy thing, because people who need expensive cancer treatment or long-term care when they're elderly divest all their assets and deliberately become penniless in order to qualify for Medicaid (this is where most of the *grandma had to sell her house for the nursing home bill* stories comes from - the nursing home bill is $90k a month, the house sold for $180k, grandma's gonna be around for a lot longer than two months now that she's in long-term care).\n\nThe hostility towards American healthcare and the hostility towards Social Security are possibly the two most annoying parts of the idiocracy to me, even though I have absolutely zero to do with either of them these days (and only ever sued them in the old days, so I don't give a fuck about their rep).",

The government is not my parent, you're right, but I sure as fuck want something back for paying a lot of taxes. My paycheck has a part where it says \"medicare\" where they deduct money for something I don't get. Instead of the military budget being almost a trillion dollars a year (to just kill innocent brown people for profits), they can lower it and provide their citizens with life saving shit. Why does this dude have to resort to donations to save his own life? Should he not have saved those children? Should I think about what would happen to me financially before saving someone's life if I ever run into a similar situation? What if it were you (I don't wish that on anyone, but for argument's sake and I apologize) who needed saving? Should I let you go because I'm worried about going bankrupt for saving your life?

They have to treat me if I go in even though I 100% don't plan on paying medical bills that are ridiculously expensive. I got charged $4000 dollars for an ambulance ride to a psych center last year, where they gave me ZERO treatment of any sort in the ambulance. Just a ride. And it cost more than MY ENTIRE WEEK at the psychiatric center. Yeah sorry dudes, you aren't ever seeing that money \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: yes, that was not a typo. FOUR THOUSAND fucking dollars for a glorified taxi ride",
