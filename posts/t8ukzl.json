Stop causing trauma or believing trauma is a good thing that helps growth. Stop indocrinating people with religious beliefs that are anti human at best and gross elitism and racism at it's worst. Self growth and finding a meaning in life (all religion is) is traumatic without it being dictated by every whim and belief of any random religion or state. That is the answer. The answer I don't have is what makes people reject  loving each other? Survival of the fittest is the excuse I hear the most or some version of a competitive nature. Both are human made theories that we perpetuate when as a species we should all be doing much better than we are when it comes to mental health, prosperity, and caring. We don't have to struggle with each other but when we do, some groups leverage that to make money and power so they continue the false struggle against other humans when the struggle is with ourselves and how we interact with ourselves and others. Peace does not give people power and so peace does not feed the weaker natures who crave power. And those weaker natures always use deceit and misdirection to gain more power. So empower them to not need power... or some nonsense.",
