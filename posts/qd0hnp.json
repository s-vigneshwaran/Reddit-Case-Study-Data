Here are a couple facts:\n\n\\- Wasps are essential for ecosystem functioning and indirectly responsible for increased food production.\n\n\\- Most wasp species prey on other insects, including agricultural pests (the ones hovering over your drink are adults in search of a sugar fix to fuel their flight). Some wasps are parasitoids, laying eggs in other insects. After hatching, the offspring feed on those insects, making them a natural and effective pesticide.\n\n\\- Many wasps are also essential pollinators. Figs, for example, are pollinated by minute, specialized wasps (Fig Wasps)\n\n\\- Yellowjacket wasps are also very effective and essential scavengers that are partially responsible for breaking down decaying fruit and flesh in the areas they live.\n          \nEdit: Oh hey!

I would probably be more logically afraid of my little bombus apid\u00e6 friends since they are often in very large numbers around the flower beds and are more likely to swarm than a few wasps here and there.\n\nUsually it's just the bumbies, honeys, and yellowjacket wasps, and theu don't much seem to give a shit, even when I'm watering they kinda semi-swarm before quickly acting as if they realize what I'm doing is helpful to their cause, and will wait until I am done or move to a separate flower bed.\n\nI appreciate your appreciation of our flying, pollenating friends.",

They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"crow family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Apoidea, which includes things from bees to wasps.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a bee a wasp is because random people call the nice ones bees? Let's get all non-stinging wasps in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A bee is a bee and a member of the wasp family. But that's not what you said. You said a bee is a wasp, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the wasp family wasps. Which you don't.\n\nIt's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?\n\n\nCopypasta of course but ants actually aren't wasps btw.",

Since all bees are members of Apoidea, it\u2019s reasonable to call them a type of wasp. I never said they aren\u2019t a type of bee, because that\u2019s a tautology. The lines are kind of blurry anyway, because, for example, Nomada are solitary bees that don\u2019t collect pollen.\n\nFun video on the topic https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4uLSFOwASCA",

It is also possible to trick plants into ripening figs without wasps by spraying them with plant hormones.\n\nEven when figs are grown the old-fashioned way, with wasps, the wasp is long gone by the time the fig crosses your lips. Figs produce a chemical called \u201cficin\u201d that breaks down the wasp bodies. Ficin is so effective at breaking down, or digesting, animal proteins that natives of Central America eat fig sap to treat intestinal worm infections.",

The queen and a few male eggs are the only ones that survive til the spring. It's really kind of sad, all these unemployed, aimless wasps, just waiting around to die.",

I've been taking philosophy classes recently (ethics, mostly) and the moral basis for a legal system comes up a lot. It is, in my opinion, morally good for a legal system to push towards a post-scarcity society, where anyone can have unlimited access to any necessity.*\n\nCapitalism has its merits, particularly when it comes to luxury goods. Supply and demand does a wonderful job of promoting innovation and efficiency in production. The arms race of smartphones, for example, has undoubtedly created no less than a miracle - nearly every human being on the planet has access to almost all of humanity's knowledge at their fingertips if they know how to search for it properly. \n\nWhat Capitalism *doesn't* do well is allocate required resources in a fair manner. It is absolutely ridiculous for anyone to die because they had to choose between Insulin and food and rent, [yet here we are](https://www.wtae.com/article/skyrocketing-insulin-prices-force-some-to-choose-between-medicine-and-food/9588176). I would dare say that it is morally reprehensible for the legal system to even allow such a thing to happen. Insulin costs pennies per dose to make, yet \"consumers\" are paying hundreds a month. Supply and demand doesn't function in the same way for necessities as it does for luxuries - for all intents and purposes, the demand curve for a necessity is about as infinitely high as it can get. \n\nWe are at a time in human history where there are clearly enough resources for everyone to live like kings, but the race to the top of the wealth pyramid is holding everyone back like crabs in a bucket. I see social policies - universal income, universal healthcare, guaranteed shelter, etc. - as the stepping stones to getting to said post-scarcity.\n\n*Edit - To be clear, the reason for this is that this is the true definition of liberty, not whatever bungled mess people seem think define liberty right now. If a person has no needs, they are free to fully explore their wants and desires. Painters can dedicate themselves fully to their art, teachers can properly develop comprehensive lesson plans, and no one ever again has to feel forced to work a job they hate because they need money to live. Liberty is good, so a society that pushes for this true liberty is good.",

To be successful, companies need only profit by a single dollar (or pound/euro/won/etc.). Corporate personhood exists as a contract with -- and for the benefit of -- the host community and its residents who work directly for them or in other roles which support them, from services (including emergency) to schools to plumbers, bakers, and everything else which comprises a community. Shareholders come last and their rent-seeking must be strictly controlled in order to ensure a firm's future & longevity while preventing the absurd capital stripping by groups like Bain Capital.\n\n*That* is proper capitalism, and does indeed best allocate resources. An interesting thought experiment I ended up discussing was the idea of implementing more efficient conservation using capitalism. Want to save the whales? Then someone -- any entity, be it a single hippie or an NGO or a country -- *someone* needs to own them all. This allows a value to be assigned and encourages protection in order to maximise standing. It does *not* require killing/eating them, and even selling whales needn't necessarily occur as long as the possibility to do so exists. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n^(^1) ^(or other similar, neutral organisation. )",

I'm glad everything's peachy on your side of the Atlantic <3\n\n> maybe culture has a lot to do with the success of it or not?\n\nThis is definitely a massive part of it - at least in the US, the culture is overwhelmingly *against* helping other people. There's a sort of fantasy that perpetuates our society, that of a rugged, individual, autonomous man who answers to no one. Most, if not all, of our folk heroes embody that stereotype, such that it is essentially the dream of most people to retire to a cabin in the woods once they are affluent enough.\n\nCritically, this attitude of \"I need to be independent\" gets *forced* on other people. You see this all the time over here, with millionaires and billionaires claiming that poor people simply didn't work hard enough. It's a sort of victim-blaming culture centered around rugged individualism, where anyone who isn't independent deserves to be poor because they were lazy. They should have built their own house, started their own business! People willfully ignore the fact that land costs hundreds or thousands of percent more than it used to and that it takes capital to start a business. \n\nSo, when progressive policies such as \"guys, maybe we shouldn't let people die on the street of starvation and/or lack of insulin\" get proposed, it's eternally frustrating to see them constantly shut down in the name of profit margins. We *should be helping people*, end of story. Anything less is morally reprehensible - but about half of Americans don't see it that way.",

Still, it has some pretty deep problems.",

Take it or leave it, I'm just trying to provide what you asked.\n\nIt's great that you have low unemployment, equal wages across genders, etc. Just don't mistake those metrics for proof that capitalism is working, because that statement is missing an important qualifier: for what end goal is capitalism working?\n\nOne could, for example, point out that the overconsumption and reliance on fossil fuels is going to result in severe backlash from climate change, which would be quite troublesome for those of us that can't afford to deal with it.\n\nAnother argument might focus on the ethics of the system. As an example, the British Empire brought great prosperity to Britain, but the colonies that Britain had were treated horribly. So regardless of how well things were going in Britain, it was sustained by an unjust system, which rendered the British account of themselves as a benevolent, just, and Godly nation rather hard to believe.",

In philosophy, it's been widely debated what omnipotence should actually be defined as in the first place.  The one I prefer is that God's power is such that no other being or entity could compete with it, even unsuccessfully.  This avoids the good ol' rock paradox and basically all other paradoxes involving omnipotence that could exist.\n\nRegarding paradoxes earlier in the thread, I may as well address the traditional definition itself:\n\n- Omnipotent\n- Omnibenevolent\n- Omniscient\n- Omnipresent\n- Supernatural\n\nI'll just take care of the easy ones first.  Supernatural just means God's existence can neither be proven or disproven, simple enough.  Omnipresent is just the fancier way of saying \"God is everywhere.\"  Especially if you believe that God is the universe itself, this isn't a particularly troublesome one.  We already discussed omnipotence, so that leaves us with the last two.\n\nOmnibenevolence... easy answer.  God isn't omnibenevolent.  He's the Creator first and foremost.  Just as He creates the capacity for good, He also creates the capacity for evil.  There is no conflict of interest, because God's central role is as Creator of all that exists.  Imagine being in charge of a sandbox universe, and you decide to watch what your creations do and decide whether their actions are justification for going to Hell or not.  Of course, whether Hell actually exists is up for debate, as the Bible is far too vague and varied with its references to a place of darkness, a lake of fire, a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth, etc, but that's a whole extra can of worms.  Bottom line, God is not omnibenevolent.\n\nAs for omniscience, this wasn't discussed in the thread exactly, but a common argument is that, if God is omniscient, then how do we have free will?  This is predicated on the idea that God must know all that will happen.  Many Christians simply claim both are true without elaborating, and believers in predestination, like Calvinists, just say \"trick question, we don't have free will.\"\n\nPersonally, I feel omniscience is similarly open to multiple definitions like omnipotence is.  So, one could define omniscience as: God's knowledge is such that no other being or entity could compete with it.  This opens the door to, in my opinion, more plausible possibilities.  For example, why say God knows all that will happen, when instead we could say God knows all that *could* happen?  To elaborate, which requires more capacity for knowledge, a) knowing all the events of the future or b) knowing every single possible event that could occur and every single possible timeline that could result from them?\n\nI mean, imagine you're walking somewhere, and you see a hotdog stand.  According to the two different options, God's knowledge can be understood in the following ways:\n\na) God knows you will approach the hotdog stand, ask for a hotdog, request mustard and relish, then pay the man and continue on your way.\n\nb) God knows that you can either approach the hotdog stand or continue on your way.  If you approach the hotdog stand, God knows that you can ask for a hotdog or decide against it and continue on your way.  If you ask for a hotdog, God knows that you can request ketchup, mustard, relish, bbq sauce, any combination of the four, and even request something that the hotdog stand doesn't have, or request no condiments at all.  If you decide on mustard and relish, you can pay the man, lie that you don't have your wallet, ask if you can pay at a later time, and/or take off with your hotdog.  If you pay the man, God knows you can continue on your way, stand nearby while you eat, find a bench to sit down, or something else.\n\nNot only is b already a lot more information to simply know automatically, but God also knows all the possible results from every single option given, knows of options I didn't even include, knows of possible results of other events and possible events that may affect the possible results of this one thread of possible events, and this knowledge applies to literally everything that exists in the universe.  I dunno about you, but this seems like much greater evidence of knowing more than any being or entity could manage, while still allowing for free will.\n\nSorry for giving an entire essay of information, but hopefully it's helpful or at least interesting.  Feel free to dm me with any questions!",

I know plenty of people who have had that very same experience with religion, where their family was in some part responsible for pushing them away from religion.

For example, my mother believes God is less a being and more an energy throughout the universe.\n\nEven still, I've proven to be so divergent from my family's beliefs and so far from mainstream Christianity that I don't actually know if there is a denomination that fits what I believe.  I just call myself a Christian heretic for lack of a better term.  Now that I think about it, you should probably keep that in mind with what I've said on Christianity!\n\nAgh, anyway, talking too much again, hope you have a wonderful day as well!\n\nPS: It's actually kinda funny you said a very religious family, cuz like I know exactly what you're talking about, but my family considers *me* the most religious one by far.  Just a little thing I thought I'd add, I'll stop talking now!",

It's just a common issue people have, so I thought I'd address it.\n\nAs for the issue you're talking about... I said God *isn't* omnibenevolent.  You said He can't be perfectly good, as opposed to perfectly evil if I understand.  My answer is that you're correct, and He's not.  There's like, an entire paragraph explaining my thoughts on that in the comment you claim never addresses this.\n\nMaybe it didn't come across very clearly, and heck, I forgot to define omnibenevolence in the first place so that could be my bad.

I just have a tendency to write essays of information when I actually have things to contribute to a discussion, and sometimes it can get rather difficult to grab the main points of them with the meandering and confusing ways I talk.\n\nPersonally, I don't think I know nearly enough just yet (and perhaps I never will).  While I've read through various parts of the Bible, I still have to read through the whole thing (granted, haven't been reading any books due to college, but still).  I was just lucky enough to have an environment where questions and pondering regarding religion was encouraged, so I've been able to actually dive in and understand things for myself.\n\nI can understand having disdain for religion.  Many awful things have been committed in the name of religion, many religious people have made it a bastion of regressive and oppressive beliefs, and many of those people often bash others for being curious, let alone skeptical.  And, of course, the frequent idea that many of the less realistic stories are to be taken as literal events in history.  Honestly, I'd probably not be very religious if I didn't have the family I was blessed with (just the figure of speech, not literal blessing).\n\nPersonally, I feel God inspired many of the world's religions, not necessarily by imparting morals but by simply existing as He does.  Christianity, or at least my take on it, is just the way *I* follow Him.  If you don't follow Christianity, that's fine.  If you don't follow any religion, that's fine too.  If you don't believe there even is a God, part of me wants to say He doesn't care.\n\nI fully respect your belief (or lack thereof, I suppose) and I'm certainly not about to say you're going to Hell nor try to convert you to my faith.  I dooo hope you aren't the type to call it all \"fairy tales,\" though, cuz it's rather demeaning and disrespectful, even if you dislike religion.  I'd be happy to discuss my beliefs and such further if you have any interest or curiosity, just dm me!\n\nAnd now I realise how long this comment is, sorry about that!  Hope you have a wonderful whatever time it is!",

This condition must be true, so the thing the paradox is trying to criticize god for failing to create can't really be \"a thing\" at all\n\nIt's like asking god to create a cube with seven sides, you're defining something and then asking him to do something that would break the definition... I think...\n\nSomething I've always wondered is - why doesn't an omnipotent, omnipresent god just immediately commit suicide?\n\nIn an instant of time, he thinks, knows, sees, experiences, simulates all things. Nothing is undone for him. All results are known, every permutation and energy state in the universe(s) accounted for at every time. There is of course one last thing God can do, one last thing he can't see beyond - his own nonexistence. He hasn't done that yet, because if he had, he wouldn't be there. Can he even destroy himself?\n\nI don't believe in the guy but he's fun to think about",

So he would have to create a law in the universe where such object could be.\n\nEdit number 2: But... thinking again... if he is able to do anything, then he should be able to make the object WITHOUT having to create a law for it, he should be able to create it with the universe current laws, without breaking anything...

So whether he can or cannot \"lift\" theoretical mountains, he still has all authority and control over that mountain and himself in that situation.\n\n\n\nThirdly, our limited, finite minds is incapable of  comprehending the infinity of God. I can't , you can't , nobody can. There are many things about God which humans are incapable of understanding. For example, we can't understand the Trinity. How can God be 3 and also 1? It's contradictory and makes no sense. However, our lack of comprehension does not subtract from the greatness of God; whether or not we understand God's Trinity or omnipotence does not make him any less Triune or sovereign.\n\n\n\n\n\nGod isn't bound by our reasoning. He doesn't need anyone to tell him what he can or cannot do. Mere human logic falls utterly short when compared to his infinite wisdom, knowledge, and power.",

Mathematics isn\u2019t something that can be created or destroyed, it simply IS. I don\u2019t quite know how to get my brain around it, but if you take away everything in all of creation, logic and mathematics would still exist. Even if you take away god. Those constructs cannot be destroyed, they are intrinsic properties of reality. So that says to me, god is not all-powerful; he must always be constrained by logic. It then logically follows (to me at least) that god is not truly god. Logic is god. That which cannot be separated from reality, the intrinsic properties of the universe, without which there would be not something but nothing. And since it is from those unbreakable laws that reality emerges, the only true religion is science. :) Annnnd time for me to go to bed.",

And neither of them are untruthful despite being logically incompatible.\n\nSo, when people say that God *had* to create evil or we would have nothing to compare goodness to, that logic doesn't track because he decided that goodness has to be compared for it be appreciated and understood. He could just have easily created a universe that didn't require evil for any reason whatsoever, despite how illogical or impossible that might sound to *us*.",

I cringe when people talk about God as if \"he\" is some seperate sentient being who created little mini versions of himself and loves and judges us from the heavens.\n\nIt only takes one psychedelic trip to realize this is nonsense. God is not anything that remotely resembles any God figure youve seen in the movies. God, as most the world views him, does not exist. \n\nWhat does exist is the universe. That's all there is or ever was. The galaxies, sun's, moons, planets, and all who inhabit them are all one of the same. Together we create the universe aka \"God\". \n\nWe all share the spirit of God. Because the only spirit that exists is God's. We are all god experiencing ourself from different perspectives. From the biggest whale in the ocean to the tiniest microscopic bacteria, all life makes up what is God. Because God is everywhere.  There is only one thing in existence. And that is God.\n\nNow one piece of the puzzle that I have not figured out yet is sin. I know hell as viewed in religion does not exist. Rather it is an emotional place furthest from god. It is fear without love. What I don't know is why sin exists. A life lived without sin is a life most intuned with love and light.  And a life of paradise. So why we naturally are drawn to sin I do not understand. \n\nHowever I am positive it is not because Eve ate an apple.",

Many young atheists love this because they see it as this \"gotchya\" for people who believe in an omnipotent God. Like it just makes the whole thing poof into a cloud of logic and reason.\n\nIt's a meaningless paradox. It's interesting until you realize that the rules of time and reality wouldn't apply anyway to an omnipotent being, and our  human understanding of the universe is woefully incomplete. There's just so much we don't know, and may never know. So much we can't even fathom because we know only our own small existence on a tiny blue speck in vast blackness so large, we can't really wrap our minds around it.\n\nAnyway, I just prefer to walk away from it and say I just don't know what's going on. I can describe the world I see, measure it, confirm it as true to an extent, peer review it. And we can accomplish a lot this way, and that's fine. But that's the universe we know, and we keep digging and finding more that makes us realize it's all still a great mystery to us. And that's fine too. Let's keep looking, why commit to one answer or another? We can find truth in more than just the corporeal, too.",

I was an instructor (sure, never got tenure, whatever), for 7 years.  No, or you just came from a program that had a bunch of theists in it.  The logical problem of evil, the evidential problem of evil, and the problem of free will are still very much considered heavyweight status amongst arguments against the existence of God.  There\u2019s a reason philosophy departments are almost entirely atheist, and it\u2019s those arguments.\n\n> That\u2019s the whole deal with the argument, all it needs to say is there could be a morally sufficient reason for the world to be the way we see it now\n\nSo, again, to be clear, you\u2019re biting the genocide bullet?  Every single genocide ever in the history of humanity is justified because of God\u2019s great plan that\u2026wait, aren\u2019t we assuming God exists in order for this argument to work?

Some armchair Leibniz now?  Good lord man, I said that is a tough bullet to bite but you bit it.  I\u2019m just gonna say no, I don\u2019t think the Holocaust was necessary to better the world.  Care to argue that Hitler\u2019s actions made this world better or\u2026?\n\nIf you were sincere in your last paragraph, I would read up on the evidential problem of evil and Hume\u2019s *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion.*",

You're taking an all-purpose backdoor. You're also making assumptions that cannot be proven. Sure there may be A LOT of things that a supposed omniscient God can comprehend while we mortals cannot. But how can you prove that? That's wild speculation.\n\nBut in my defence, here's the thing with binaries by definition: One is the absence of the other. Otherwise one or the other loses any meaningful way of existing. How can you explain color to a colorblind person (assuming they see only in B&W) who has no concept of what color is? They know that people see differently, but they'd have no meaningful way of grasping the concept of color. If you can, for example, explain color without referring to colorlessness, then you have revolutionized modern philosophy and you're the next Aristotle.\n\nBut here's the other thing. I think that's exactly where the paradox of God is. On one hand if he has created evil, then he's not omnibenevolent by definition because if he is pure good, then he'd have no concept of evil. On the other hand, if he is omnibenevolent and hasn't created evil, then he isn't omnipotent because he is unable to create evil.",

It makes very clear sense to me that, for example, an omniscient God would understand the full consequences of introducing free will into existence, and that one of those consequences would be morality (i.e. interpretations of \"good and evil\").\n\nThe notion that things can be true without being known by humanity (or other species) isn't controversial in the least, as we have several real-world examples of this we can draw upon. To draw upon your colorblindness point: one example would be the existence of the color blue. Blue is a rare color in nature, and there's evidence that human beings couldn't actually see the color blue until about 6000 years ago. An omniscient God would be aware of the full spectrum of light frequency and all of the subjective experiences of color that would be possible based on human anatomy and all possible viable mutations thereof (again, this is omniscience *by definition*), and there are *still* colors out there we cannot see (such as those on the ultraviolet spectrum). TL;DR: It is not required that the color-blind person understand color for the phenomenon of color to be a possibility.\n\nWhile I understand color is not a binary, I don't think that's relevant to my angle at approaching morality here. I agree that *humans* would not know good without evil, but an omniscient God could nonetheless understand good and evil as possibilities without their actual existence being experienced by human beings.\n\nThe question here isn't whether nor not \"good and evil\" can exist *as concepts* independently outside of their relationship to each other, as I do not believe they can. The question is whether we can have a universe where only \"good\" happens. Humans would never be able to comprehend it, because they lack omniscience or any sort of objective point of view, but such a universe would be *possible* and an omniscient God *would* be in a position to assess that.\n\n> You're also making assumptions that cannot be proven.\n\nThis is a hypothetical discussion about the logical possibilities of God. Nothing needs to be \"proven\" empirically here. This is akin to arguing a mathematical proof; you don't need to be counting physical objects in order for a mathematical proof to have internal, logical consistency.\n\nAnd let's be especially clear: I don't believe in God. I'm not arguing for God's existence here, or anything of the sort. I think the notion of omnipotence itself is... well, it quickly renders itself moot. I'm only arguing that, *if* we were to assume God was real, omnipotent, and omniscient, such a God would be capable of creating a world that has good in it without evil existing in that world. I'm arguing *against* the existence of an omnipotent, omnibenevolent God.",

John knew of the Synoptic gospels and the rest of the NT. If this is the case, he knew what you know and still wrote exactly what you find there. You don't need to \"contextualize\" it if John already had the relevant context when writing.\n2. John did not know of the Synoptic gospels and the rest of the NT. If that's the case, then stop trying to make John say the same thing as the rest of the writers. He was likely an individual with his own opinions and he wrote them down as such. Stop trying to force him to say something he didn't.\n\nThose are just your surface level options.

Here is a nice look at the evidence as I see it:\n\n* The majority view for dating the gospels is \\~70-95 CE\n* So let's put Mark \\~70 CE (keep in mind you can push it earlier, but that makes my point here even stronger)\n* Between \\~85-110 we have a bunch of sources (Didache \\~85, 1 Clement \\~95, Epistle of Barnabas \\~100, Polycarp \\~110, Ignatius \\~110, etc) that all quote the gospels anonymously. The use wording like \"according to the gospel\" or \"as it is written\".\n* Next we get sources like Papias (\\~125), Justin Martyr (\\~155), etc. They sometimes talk about authorship but it's clearly not in the way things are today. Martyr mentions \"memoirs of the apostles\" and appears to be completely unaware of the existence of John. Papias mentions Mark and Matthew but he appears to be quoting sources or gospels that have been lost, not the ones we have today.\n* Finally in \\~180, essentially 110 years after the first gospel is written, we get Irenaeus (\\~180), Clement of Alexandria (\\~190), Tertullian (\\~200), etc. with traditional authorship.\n\n  \nKeep in mind, I'm actually overstating that evidence. Sources like Papias have actually been completely lost to history and we only have fragments of what they wrote pieced together by secondhand quotations (in this case it's Eusebius writing in like the 4th century and he is clearly biased against many of Papias's theological beliefs so it's hard to know how much to trust him) so not only is Papias almost 50 years removed from the original authorship but we are relying on another person supposedly quoting Papias like 200+ years later. Keep in mind this is all without a modern inventions like the printing press, paleography, etc. Is this really your \"good\" evidence of the authorship?",

It could not have evolved by chance. It proves that You exist, and so therefore, by Your own arguments, You don't.

Not the kids fault they're hyper, but if you just let them go they're going to terrorize everyone else, and then the task is figuring out how to make boundaries without being abusive.

If we operate under the assumption that god is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, that means the evil that god allows to exist is ultimately meant to help us or guide in someway toward good. \n\nPredestination is also a massively complex subject among Christian scholars. To boil it down basically God knows what you will do with the life he grants you, but you don\u2019t. \n\nFrom your perspective of only being able to exist in one moment at a time collecting pictures of moments gone by, the future is still very much in your hands. Basically your life is a pen and paper RPG. God knows exactly which path you\u2019ll take and what ending you\u2019ll arrive at, but in your eyes all you can see is where you\u2019ve been & where you\u2019re at. It\u2019s still your path to walk even if he already knows where it\u2019s going.\n\nThe other thing is that God when god creates a person knowing they\u2019ll stray from the light and defy his will, he loves them so much he still gives them life because love is the ultimate expression of all that is good and light.",

He wants them to make that choice and doesn\u2019t force people to. If you forced someone to love you it wouldn\u2019t be love right? So if God could force people to love him it wouldn\u2019t be love, so it\u2019s paradox. From what my limited understanding is that free will and the option to make bad choices was given to people. Otherwise we would be just robots, which God doesn\u2019t want. So it is impossible for God to give people free will and have them not make bad choices. I can see how this questions his omnipotence, but I think even a cosmic deity can\u2019t actually change those rules. It\u2019s physically impossible. Does that make sense?

We could get into it if you\u2019d like but we wouldn\u2019t be the humans god made us to be if we didn\u2019t have our own choices to make, even allowing the worst choices imaginable.",

Guaranteed evil sounds more on the line with predestination, and that is pretty heavily linked with free will in its complexities.  Guaranteed evil is an interesting concept because it\u2019s only technically guaranteed if fate is already locked for everyone which definitely is a lengthy conversation to be had about the intricacies of that, but it\u2019s not an issue that I ponder or study enough to know my way around every point.  Put simply here\u2019s at least what I think, for what it\u2019s worth:  I think God loves everyone and hates knowing ahead of time and seeing awful things happening to people.  But what would life for us be like if bad things didn\u2019t happen to people?  I think our whole definition of bad and evil are pretty subjective when it comes to most things and that\u2019s what makes it a tough issue at times, so while it\u2019s horrible that people experience horrible atrocities around the world, it doesn\u2019t mean God doesn\u2019t love them because he allows it to happen.",

An all knowing being would simply be a slave owner if our minds are inside the simulation.\n\nDon't over think the word simulation either. If God created the universe and everything in it.

I don't know a single religion that doesn't have figures like that profiting from making stuff up at some point in their history, they have motive and means in the crime. On the other hand, there is no evidence at all that an actual god wrote books that put all the power of a society into the hands of a priest caste.\n\nI'm not saying a god can't exist, but all evidence strongly suggests that the gods written about by humans are made up.",

What is evil will be evil regardless of if we have knowledge or not, when we did not have knowledge because we didn't eat the fruit, we also had no suffering, and hence no \"incentive\" to be evil, no incentive to steal, or kill, or whatever because we are provided for on the garden.\n \nBut then we were given an incentive to sin by the devil when he tempted Eve with all the knowledge. See, noone does evil for no reason, there always was an incentive. \n\nThe gospel is actually not about choosing good, because of our sinful nature, we will always sin, it's what makes us human since the fall, instead, God wants us to choose him.\n\nIt's a misconception that God sends us to hell, actually, since the fall, we go to hell by default, it's more like the devil dragged us down to hell, but the gospel is that God can rescue us from hell, and we don't need to be sinless since that's impossible, we just have to believe in him and asked to be rescued. \n\nOf course, naturally, if you believe in God and believe you are rescued and you love God, you would want to be good and sin as little as possible, because common sense, you don't want to wrong the guy who's helping you out. And so being saved is the first step, and the journey with God and character development should naturally follow after.",

And it's through the pursuit of the answers that I can answer you guys now. \n\n2. We are being punished for sin, not the pursuit of knowledge.\n\n3. Sin causes suffering. \n\n4. Satan coaxed us into sin, I really don't understand why you are bringing knowledge up so much, God has no problem with knowledge.\n\nEDIT: I see it's because of the fruit of knowledge of good and evil that you bring knowledge up so much. My apologies! But no, God isn't against knowledge in general, he's against sin! Hope that answers your question.",

                              "text": ">I don't quite understand your wording, sorry, but I'll try to respond to the best of my understanding. What is evil will be evil regardless of if we have knowledge or not, when we did not have knowledge because we didn't eat the fruit, we also had no suffering, and hence no \"incentive\" to be evil, no incentive to steal, or kill, or whatever because we are provided for on the garden.\n> \n\nI would argue God had to create the knowledge of good and evil. Or he didn't create everything. The only way I can accept evil preexisting without God creating it is everything is relative to him. Example there is only heat and absence of more heat. Hot and cold is relative to us making them arbitrary terms.\n\nSecond in the garden there was bad/evil being done constantly. After partaking of the fruit the first thing they did was cover their nakedness because the sudden realization of the knowledge it was evil and not good. Before our knowledge God was fine with evil as long as we were ignorant of it. \n\n>But then we were given an incentive to sin by the devil when he tempted Eve with all the knowledge. See, noone does evil for no reason, there always was an incentive. \n>\n\nBefore our knowledge ignorance was good enough. Why was this temptation an incentive? It was more a persuasion. Also if there was any incentive then everything  wasn't provided for in the garden. \n\n>The gospel is actually not about choosing good, because of our sinful nature, we will always sin, it's what makes us human since the fall, instead, God wants us to choose him.\n>\n\nSo in the earliest of times before God choose his people Before the Garden of Eden stopped existing. God choose his people by what he deemed was good. He delighted in the good and righteous people and had personal relationships with them. We could always choose good or evil because the knowledge became innate to us.\n\n>It's a misconception that God sends us to hell, actually, since the fall, we go to hell by default, it's more like the devil dragged us down to hell, but the gospel is that God can rescue us from hell, and we don't need to be sinless since that's impossible, we just have to believe in him and asked to be rescued. \n>\n\nThe beginning of the Bible hell didn't exist. You return to nothing/dust when you die. Hell is a corruption of other religions and doesn't exist in the Bible until revelations.  If you study the Bible through scholarly means and look into context and religion throughout the region you would see some many strange things from the perspective of the Bible. The only other thing we can talk about is the tree of life. Something God didn't want us to recieve after we became more like him/them who knew of Good and evil.\n\n>Of course, naturally, if you believe in God and believe you are rescued and you love God, you would want to be good and sin as little as possible, because common sense, you don't want to wrong the guy who's helping you out. And so being saved is the first step, and the journey with God and character development should naturally follow after.\n>\n\nGod wanted you to do good. Since you have the knowledge of it. He sent his son to emphasize that a human can live life good and earn the tree of life which God wanted to protect in Genesis. In Jesus's time God's contract changed from do good and you are saved to believe in God and walk in Jesus's path and you are saved.",

In the garden of eden there was simply ignorance for our kind. Adam and eve could no commit good nor evil because the knowledge of it didn't exist to them. Once they took of tree. Then they obtained the knowledge of both good and evil for the whole human race.\n\nGoing all the way back to your original point some one created the tree of knowledge of good and evil. There was something beforehand ignorance. You can do whatever according to God in your own free will and it was kosher.\n\nAnother point in the early times the only requirement for heaven or to gain favor with God was to do good things. There was no rules leaving eden just innate knowledge of good and evil in all of us. Well that is before God choose his people.",

(As an analogy) in physics, space and time are interwined, and we all exist on the fabric of spacetime. \n\nWith sin, naturally comes suffering. And suffering can mean many things, including random mutations. Diseases, mutations, this stuff entered the world when sin entered the world. \n\nGod is a generational God, there have been many accounts in the Bible that children were blessed because of their parents (God turned Abraham and his descendants into a great nation) or cursed because of their parents. (When David committed adultery with Bathsheba, the first born baby from their affair was sick for days until it passed away.) \n\nBut remember that the Earth is temporary, all sin and suffering will pale in comparison to the eternity promised to us in heaven. But it's hard to grasp for us as humans because the time we have on earth is all we see.",

We all sin, as explained before, we go to hell by default, and God offers to rescue us from that.

I just don't think there's a way to look at the world as under a benevolent AND omnipotent god - the world is uncaring to any human ideas or emotions. \n\nReligion just abstracts this away by saying it's all part of the plan and that everything will be good in the afterlife, but doesn't it seems suspicious to you that you only hear that from people in the material world? And that they have an interest in keeping you devoted to the religion? Like the whole idea of having a hell, earth, and heaven is unethical from the beginning. Surely people have free will in heaven right? So why not only make good people who have free will so they can all live in heaven? Why even have satan?",

He can control but he chooses not to. He sees all the decisions I will ever make, but ultimately those are my decisions, he can give me character traits, but ultimately how I develop as a person, is up to me. And that's free will. \n\nAnd as for this second point, you are absolutely right it's completely possible to have sinless free will. That was his intention for us humans in the garden of Eden! And many angels with sinless free will still inhabit heaven. \n\nThe thing about free will is that it allows the possibility of sin, it doesn't guarantee sin, but allows possibility for it. And unfortunately, the fall happened. And since the fall happened, sin became part of human nature. \n\nAnyways, I gotta take care if some university stuff, and I been spending wayyy too much time on Reddit. Your questions are properly compelling and well thought so if you want to learn more about the Christian faith then I suggest to ask a pastor, because they will likely have much better answers than I do. \n\nCheers!",

If you take them out, then you really don't have a Bible anymore, you have a Bronze Age historical romance.

You stoop down, place the ball by your feet, and let it be. If the wind pushes it then the wind pushes it. If it just rolls down, then it just rolls down. Whatever happens to the ball is what happens, and symbolic of free will. If it ends up hitting and breaking something, that\u2019s not on you. Except that\u2019s horseshit, because \n\nA. You knew exactly what path the ball would take before you even got to the hill (omniscience)\n\nB. You deigned the physics that dictate exactly how the ball would move, how much it would way, how gravity and wind would effect it, the speed it would move at along with *the very concept of speed*\n\nC. You\u2019re the vile fucker who made it a bowling ball in the first place. You could have made it something nondestructive, soft, and less harmful. You could have just put a soft plush ball instead, or designed it to be basically weightless and not cause damage when it hits something. You could have just made it a cube or triangle incapable of really rolling and getting speed. No, instead you had to go and design it to be inclined towards rolling fast, hard, and being destructive once it gets moving enough. You made it inclined towards a specific nature/end goal and then get pissy when it does exactly that.",

That things are preordained to God's will. \n\nPeople saying, \"God has a plan for me\" is a common phrase used by Christians.\n\nI'd say it's pretty widely accepted that God has plans for people, which would imply that free will is an illusion.",

Go read 1st Chronicles 21:1 then 2nd Samuel 24:1. Notice how it\u2019s the same event and Satan and God do the same thing. Some Jewish scholars will say that Satan and God are the same here but that\u2019s because of Isaiah 45:7.\n\nThe Christians will call Lucifer Satan or the devil and will even say it was the devil in the garden of even when that isn\u2019t said anywhere.  When the Gospels were written they were already messing with the idea that Satan was evil and God was good but other Jews didn\u2019t think this way. Even Jews today will tell you satan to them is to be used as a verb and not a noun. Christians started twisting a lot of things. Hell for example was something born out of Christianity and it was The Christians who pushed the devil to be more literal and the Jews had some people pushing Satan as literal. You can see when the Jews do this when they are conquered by the Persians if I remember right. \n\nRevelations is interesting but it\u2019s not talking about literal things. You should check out Elaine Pagels book on revelations. She goes over how revelations is about Rome and it\u2019s not meant to be used as in modern times.",

          "text": "This is a good question actually, and I\u2019ll attempt to answer from the traditional Christian perspective. \n\nFirst, the person from OP\u2019s picture is totally wrong. Satan did not \u201ccreate evil.\u201d Satan himself is a creature, as you pointed out. He owes his existence to God. He cannot create in the sense that God can create. So to say he created anything is a fundamental misunderstanding of who Satan is in Christian theology.  Honestly, this person is betraying a belief in a sort of Christian Gnostic worldview, where there are two equal gods, one good and one bad, who struggle throughout time. This is not what actual Christian theology teaches and is a heresy. \n\nSecond, we have to explain what serious Christians mean when they talk about \u201cevil.\u201d \u201cEvil\u201d is not a \u201cthing\u201d that \u201cexists\u201d in the sense that say goodness or love do. \u201cEvil\u201d, in the Christian sense, is what we\u2019d call a \u201cdeprivation of the good.\u201d Putting it another way, it\u2019s a lacking in goodness, the absence of goodness. The classic example illustrating this is comparing evil to a cavity in a tooth. The cavity only exists in the sense that it\u2019s an depriving the tooth of something. Another good example is how Tolkien describes the Ring in \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d The Ring\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d isn\u2019t creative, but it warps and twists the good things that already exist. Evil therefore is a parasitic force, and saying God or anyone else \u201ccreated\u201d it is the wrong way to think about it. \n\nPushing that point farther, Satan wasn\u2019t \u201ccreated evil.\u201d According to the usual Christian tradition, he was an angel created good, but rebelled against God due to pride. So he was created good, but his goodness was corrupted. \n\nAnyway, I hope this helps. These are all good questions in this thread, and good Christians should be able to answer them.",

That's why we have conscience, that tells us what is morally acceptable. Still, we don't know, if our morality comes from God or Satan. For what we know, what if all the religion is Satan's work?

When something is written in ancient Hebrew, you kind of have to unless you become a scholar of ancient Hebrew, right? \n\nNot to get in the middle of this argument because I think it's pointless, but the Bible is an ancient text (especially that part of the text, which is many hundreds of years older than the book of Revelation) and scholars still fight over what a lot of it means. Churches split because people aren't sure what some of it means. And just as English is nuanced with words having multiple meanings in different context and shifting connotations across different generations, so does any other language. \n\nSo not only do you have to consider which ancient Hebrew word is getting translated as \"evil\" in this particular version (which, in other versions, is not translated into evil), but you also have to figure out who is saying it, in what context to whom and then figure out what his bigger message is before deciding what exactly is meant here. \n\nThat's what is meant when people say \"context.\" \n\nAgain, I'm not trying to defend anyone in this fight. But I think it's a bit of a stretch to expect that everyone who believes in these things can know enough about the original language, culture, and historical happenings to be able to determine for themselves what the meaning of the Bible is. \n\nHeck, scholars that spend their lives studying it usually just focus in on one section of the Bible so that they can dig into the time period and details therein. \n\nTLDR; Most of us are not experts in the fields that we talk about all the time. That's an unrealistic standard to put on anyone.",

Does living with moral integrity mean regularly walking past them without offering help? Can you never give a homeless person change and shelter and still live with moral integrity?\n\nI think generally society today disagrees with the first two statements but there have been long stretches of time when it didn't. One of the primary purposes of religion is to help guide a population in what is moral and what isn't, because it can be confusing and subjective without it. I think with the third statement most people would say you should help but then no one does, which confuses things even more",

Most, not all, will say it doesnt matter if his name is jesus or joshua but wont budge on calling god allah.",

Nuts.  The reality is this to me; if a Malaysian of any ilk uses \"Allah\" to mean the one and only creator - then that is God to me.",

Dante and Milton are perhaps two of the most obvious examples, but it pervades Western literature.  And approached as a work of fiction, a lot of it is actually a pretty interesting read.

It doesn't mean that no one thinking, advocating, or even writing policy have to somehow disentangle their religious beliefs at the door (were that even possible). \n\nHere's what we get:\n\n\\>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;\n\nWhen Christian abolitionists pushed for the end of slavery as a result of their religious convictions, that wasn't a violation of the establishment clause. I mean, we can look to many of the founding fathers to see a worldview that doesn't comport with what you're saying. \n\nTake John Jay, federalist author and first Supreme Court justice. I'm not saying I agree with all these quotes - I am saying that they tells us how the people who wrote and passed the establishment clause understood how religious beliefs influenced public life.\n\n>The Bible is the best of all books, for it is the word of God and teaches us the way to be happy in this world and in the next. Continue therefore to read it and to **regulate your life by its precepts.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers and **it is the duty as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian Nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.**\n\nDid a guy like John Adams allow his theology to influence his policy? Sure.\n\n>\u201cLet the pulpit resound with the doctrine and sentiments of religious liberty. **Let us hear of the dignity of man\u2019s nature, and the noble rank he holds among the works of God**...Let it be known that British liberties are not the grants of princes and parliaments.\u201d\r  \n\r\n\nWhat about George Washington?\n\n>\u201cReligion and morality are the essential pillars of civil society.\u201d\n\nBut John Jay was a committed Christian, and didn't write the establishment clause. Let's see what James Madison, the deist author of that clause said:  \n\n\n> \u201cWe have staked the future of all our political institutions upon the capacity of each and all of us to govern ourselves, to control ourselves, and to sustain ourselves according to the Ten Commandments of God.\u201d",

There's not a lot of wiggle room.\n\nWho's speaking? Well Isaiah is (or the author speaking with Isaiah voice) and Isaiah is quoting Yahweh. It's literally in the verse, no context is needed, since the verse provides the context.\n\nEdit: more wiggle than I originally gave it credit for. In fact I suspect the interpretation offered below is probably correct",

I think it's a rather fruitless argument to begin with.",

However, God can cause natural evil because pain can ultimately serve God\u2019s good ends or purpose for creation. It seems clear from the context that this verse refers to God creating natural evil.\u201c",

It literally means \u201cbad\u201d in a very broad sense.  It can mean evil, or calamity (which is the translation I prefer for this passage), but if you really wanted to be wooden about it, just translating it as \u201cI make peace and I create bad things\u201d would still be fine.\n\nIt\u2019s not unthinkable for the Old Testament to attribute \u201cevil\u201d to god (although I don\u2019t think that is what is happening here).  It\u2019s clear that the OT\u2019s understanding of divinity, good, and evil are very different from that of Christian theology.  See especially Job, Exodus 30-35, and Psalm 78.  I mean, Christian theology is heavily based on Plato, who hadn\u2019t even been born when Isaiah was written.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Christians focus on god as \u201cgood,\u201d and the Hebrews focus on god as \u201ctranscendent.\u201d  While the Christian god is expected to never cause us harm, or do things we understand as evil, the Hebrew god refuses to be questioned because he transcends the rules of morality.  As a college trained theologian,* I actually find the Hebrew god more plausible\u2014if not more terrifying.  A god who is defined by human morality can never pass Epicurus\u2019 trilemma, and therefore cannot exist.  A god who transcends our reality is insulated from such questioning, because its his reality to do with as he wishes.  One could say that the Hebrew god cannot do evil because whatever he does is good by virtue of who he is.\n\nAnd with that happy brain bender, I\u2019ll shut up now. :)\n\n*everytime I say this, I am reminded of my student loans.

Less straightforward than that. \n\nThere's entire sections of Christianity that believe that hell doesn't exist and when you look at the mentions of it in the Bible, there is just... Sooooo much ambiguity of what exactly hell. \n\nEvengelicals in the past 200ish years are the ones that insisted that the Bible is a literal guidebook for life and history and everything. This concept was born as a defensive reaction tp the theory of Evolution and has spiraled out of control. But before that, the Bible was viewed in a lotore of a... Flexible way. It is a collection of books from many authors over hundreds of years who are trying to figure out God, life, and morality, and have written parables, poetry, folklore, mythological tales and records of everything they thought relevant. The Christian church didn't used to view it as literal and the debate about meaning was a healthy exercise for us to find truth about God and life.",

It's somewhere deep in the New Testament. \n\nBut the fun part is... What is considered \"scripture?\" What we know as The Bible today wasn't put together until hundreds of years after that verse was written in a letter to a church. \n\nAnd when the Bible was finally compiled, it was highly debated what should or shouldn't be included. And that is why there are actually different books of the Bible included or left out for various denominations (Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, and protestants in general). \n\nBut all that is just one aspect of figuring out the significance to the Bible. Even if you (like me) believe that the Bible as we have it today *is* prod used by God, you still have to grapple with the fact that it is, in fact, humans talking to humans and they \"contradict\" each other from one and of the Bible to the other. (I hate using the word contradict because the haters just hear that word and nothing else and then they run off saying \"ah ha!\" Without really having a meaningful discussion about anything and then nothing is accomplished because no one got anything new out of the conversation and I'm rambling I'm sorry) \n\nAnyway...\n\nEven hardlined believers who say the Bible is the infallible and inerrant word of God and must be taken literally and completely, have a hard time trying to navigate the problematic bits. Between contradictions (in one place God says he will punish future generations for the crimes of their ancestors and in another place God says he doesn't hold ancestral crimes against the descendants) as well as the moral/social codes that... Don't work well with today's world (women, cover your heads, shut your mouths and obey your husbands... Oh and slaves...)\n\nThe only way that Christians can deal with those problems is by admitting that the Bible was written by humans for humans in a very human-constrained cultural time and place. \n\n....\n\n....I have no idea if I answered anything for you or if I just had a nice long mind wandering with words on a screen, but... There's a bunch of stuff I said. \n\n>Does that mean today's translation considered possibly illegitimate/flawed?\n\nI would say no, not necessarily, but there are certainly debates on all the hundreds of translations and whatnot. \n\nI think the most important thing here is that not having answers isn't bad and debate is healthy. Judao-christian tradition has a long history in healthy debate. \n\nIt's only recently that debate has turned into a taboo sign of faith-crisis in the Evengelical church.",

However, I feel my main issue wasn't addressed, as I feel how the misinterpretations occur is fairly well understood, but I think it's stated that God wants us to believe and follow Him, yet it seems like people can't even tell what the rules even are. Doesn't a lawmaker have a responsibility to at least make the rules easily understood and not lost to time?

There are some pretty obvious and easy truths that are major themes of Jesus (who, Christians believe *is* God, and therefore has more authority than anything else in the Bible and the Bible should be filtered through what he says) and the Bible. Themes of love, forgiveness, and compassion, for example. These themes are so evident that even nonbelievers know that Christians are supposed to \"love your neighbor.\"\n\n2) the Bible isn't our only avenue to find out what God wants from us. Faith can't just something read in a book. Faith is experiential. And if we ignore that spiritual side of religion, than we don't really have a religion, we just have a social code. I believe that God can and does speak odrectly to us, but there is absolutely no proof I can offer for this. \n\n3) \"believe and follow him\" doesn't necessarily need rules. I think we have some false expectations of what Christianity is supposed to be. If Jesus is what Christianity is, then again, I think he was fairly straightforward about what he wants from us (although most of us really want to avoid the part of \"sell everything you have and give the money to the poor\" myself included).",

Religious extremists are obvious examples, and perhaps its possible that the vast majority know full well they are in the wrong and are just straight up lying about their beliefs, but there has to be an occasional individual that was just being tricked by peer pressure or whatever it may be, and committed atrocities because they thought it was right. What is the fate for those people? Because from my understanding, to actually act 100% like Jesus is basically impossible to expect from people, so the act of truly wanting to be like Jesus and at least trying, is more of the test of being a Christian. And even though you may have acted wrongly in the past, as long as you realize your mistakes and truly repent, you are forgiven. Do suicide bombers go to heaven? They don't quite get the time to reflect and repent as others do. What about devout extremists that don't get the opportunity to be exposed to alternative views due to where they live?\n\nI guess ultimately, God knows the answers to these things, so it is difficult to make this an argument against the goodness of God, but idk, I just find it strange that whatever God's intentions were, it seems like there are clear fractures on what some groups think is right and wrong and some people can think doing terrible things can be the right thing due to a misunderstanding, and that God is ok with that. I feel a good God wouldn't want those kinds of misunderstandings to even be a possibility.\n\nI kinda like the 10 commandments. A big rock with rules would have kept things a lot easier. I guess when things go corporate, rules and regulations get more complicated. Once Jesus came in, Heaven had to add him to the board of directors, an HR department, and have you seen their contract? Its like 66-73 books long",

That\u2019s why I said it\u2019s based on faith.  \n  \n>Faith isnt about reading a book and deciding that God must be real because the book said so.  \n  \nAgreed. That seems more like loyalty being exhibited once one\u2019s faith in the book is determined.  \n  \n>Faith is experiential. The book is just a huge exploration of that experienced faith written by so many people (Genesis is thought to have at least 3 authors and that's just one of 66 books) over a vast expanse of history.  \n  \nYou say \u201cfaith is experiential\u201d. I agree, if you would consider my belief that our solar system actually does lie on the outer arm of our galaxy \u201cfaith\u201d. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s true, but based on my experiences with the reliability and confirmability of science, I feel as though there is reasonable justification to hold the belief. Same as holding the belief that we are real.  \n  \nHowever, I think there are two distinctions between my beliefs and the faith displayed by believers in God. 1) My beliefs are based on confirmable science or known possibilities and I view the concept of the supernatural as admittedly possible, but impossible to prove existent and impossible to prove non-existent. That makes me more skeptical of the supernatural than just a known possibility that I simply can\u2019t verify. 2) My beliefs don\u2019t discount the possibility of God because I can\u2019t disprove the claim, but believers discount any possibility other than God existing without the amount of justification required to make that assertion. I\u2019ve heard the Kalam and other arguments, but they all make assumptions about the universe based on some scientific knowledge we didn\u2019t have a few decades ago. If we discover in 20 years that the universe will stop expanding and start contracting and can prove it, then everyone basing their arguments for God on science will have to do a hard 180.  \n  \n>The Bible is not a science book. It's not even a history book. It's an ancient discussion with different people trying to figure out the invisible and intangible.  \n  \nI haven\u2019t heard this perspective before. I viewed it differently, but it\u2019s been a while since I read through each book. Some parts are different than others, but it seems like more of a divine rule book with stories for explanation than a philosophical exercise to me.  \n   \n>What Evengelicals do with the Bible (using it to replace God, himself, and insisting that it's a clear cut formula for life and everything) is a twisted reactionary movement that is very recent in the church history.

Dust from the floor of the Tabernacle.\n\nThat's it, and as a result there are a few different interpretations of this trial of ordeal. But I think it is important to note that this is not something a women would do voluntarily, and is only done under suspicion of adultery.\n\nAnother thing to remember is that if we look at these two ingredients, H2O and dirt, this trial actually greatly favors the woman's innocence, as neither of those ingredients are abortifacients, which is a good thing in a classical patriarchal society where women had few rights or ability to defend against a husband's accusations.",

This was very much a 'do unto others' situation, because you had to depend on the protection of others when you, yourself, went traveling.\n\nSo when Lot offers his daughters to be raped by the people of Sodom, he's not doing it in a mercurial way, but in a last-ditch attempt to preserve is foremost social commitment (to protect his guests) by abandoning all his other social commitments in favor of what Lot considered to be the most important.\n\nAnd these social commitments were, of course, wrapped up in religious strictures and commandments specific to Judaism of the time.\n\nAn analogy to the situation is there are two people drowning in front of you: a 90 year-old man and a 10 year-old child. You have the opportunity to only save one of them; which one do you save? Obviously, the child. We have various ethical considerations, many of which are imparted to us by our cultural contexts and experiences.\n\nAnd in Lot's own specific cultural and experiential context, saving his guests was the ethically superior action, and this was defined as righteous in the eyes of the authors of these religious scriptures.\n\nYou, as a modern individual, have every right to not agree, to be disgusted, and to assert that these events never transpired at all. But there is a fairly understandable context to this proposed series of events.",

But I will try to provide my prospective.\n\nFirst, we in 2021 are right to look on in horror at the events described. Simply put, we do not live in the ancient/prehistoric Near East. Our society is different, and we straight-up have better solutions to the problems posed to Lot than sending out female relatives to be raped in lieu of guests.\n\nSecond, I think the story has lost its original meaning, especially among American Protestants who emphasized the story of Sodom and Gomorrah's smiting to criminalize and condemn homosexual relations.\n\nThe original meaning, and that which is emphasized in the text itself, is the people of Sodom and Gomorrah's lack of hospitality towards the two angels. Many Islamic scholars have a rather interesting take on the events described here in the Bible that also deemphasize the sexual immorality and emphasize the lack of hospitality the main failing of Sodom and Gomorrah's populace.\n\nThird, I do have a critique of your analysis of the text. The angels were not sent by God to test Lot specifically. They were sent to see if they could find 50 people in those towns who would offer them hospitality, and thus be viewed as righteous. If there were at least 50 such righteous people, God would not nuke the two towns, which He had already penned in on His schedule. Abraham essentially is advocating as a lawyer for Sodom and Gomorrah here, and the whole 2 angels finding 50 good dudes is a concession Abraham negotiates from God down to 10.\n\nBut your original question stands: why would a omnipotent, omnipresent, omnibenevolent God do *any* of this? Well, that's the Problem of Evil, probably the very oldest theological problem, to which there are thousands of proposed answers and many thousand more critiques of those answers. Any of them will probably be better than what I could type here.\n\nIt strikes you as lunacy, because, to us, it *is* lunacy in a modern context. But to Lot, or the writers of Genesis, and in their specific historical, cultural, and religious context, this story makes a lot of sense and provides a very clear moral: when presented with a dilemma that forces you to forsake either one social obligation or the other, choose to forsake the lesser obligation.",

The story of Lot in Sodom and Gomorrah is from one author or group of authors, and then right after it, we have the account you describe. In my opinion, there is no moral to the story of Lot's daughters raping him after they had gotten him drunk, and afterwards bearing him children.

                                  "text": "I think it is entirely fair to say, \"This makes no sense to me.\" Or even, \"The sense this is making is making me think more and more that God is the bad guy here.\" But Genesis was written by specific human beings, who had particular minds, and wrote in the fullness of their historical and cultural contexts.\n\nSo we have to ask what the specific moral or morals the author of this story was trying to teach us? Well, first, it was that hospitality (and here we're talking about the social obligation in the ancient Near East, not our modern idea of hospitality) is one of the highest social - and therefore religious - obligations a person has. Second, that Lot was faced with a dilemma that ensured that if he upheld his obligation to protect his guests, he would fail in his obligation to protect his family. In Lot's specific cultural setting, the greater obligation was to his guests. So the second moral is that when one is faced with such a dilemma, you should choose to uphold the most important social obligation, even if it means failing another, lesser obligation.\n\nNow, when we get into the specifics of the story, and the fact that it is sensational in its sexual nature, it's pretty hard for us to do anything but turn away in disgust, especially considering the harm that this story has been used to do against gay people in consensual, loving relationships.\n\nBut I think we can take away from the story the moral that there exist greater and lesser social obligations, and sometimes it is important to put aside the lesser to uphold the greater. For instance, it is generally considered wrong to lie, but if a lie prevents a murder, perhaps the lie was worth telling.\n\nAs to the angels, they sort of observe the situation until things start to get out of hand. The crowd turns down Lot's offer of his daughters and look like they're just gonna kill everyone, so the angels grab Lot, and bring him inside. Then they strike the crowd blind and tell Lot of God's plan to nuke his town, and that he and his family need to get out. So the angels sort of do Lot a solid here, and we have to take from theology that they're working on God's order to do so, because the text makes it seem like the angels are just sort of winging this.\n\nAnyway, things don't go so well for Lot after this, or his wife, specifically. In fact, things get even weirder afterwards. But hey, let's just not ask too many questions about the moral Baby Moab was trying to teach us.\n\nEDIT: And a note about ancient hospitality and guest right, and what the Bible might have been trying to teach for modern people -\n\nTravelers in the ancient world were vulnerable. Even if they were individually powerful, even kings in their own land, when they were abroad, they were entirely at the mercy of their hosts. Because being able to travel was necessary - to form business agreements, marriage contracts, political and military alliances, for trade and learning - there developed an overriding, mutual obligation to protect guests and to extend to them hospitality.\n\nIt is utterly lost on a modern audience how much of a pain in the ass it would have been to travel in the ancient world, especially in the times when there was not an overawing, imperial polity present. No credit cards, no real equivalent to restaurants or inns in most places, language barriers, differences in currency and custom. The list goes on.\n\nSo the charge to be dutiful towards travelers and to extend to them hospitality, which meant protection, food, a place to sleep, and often gifts of money or other media of barter to help them along, is not really useful in the modern context. Instead, we should think of it as a charge to be dutiful towards vulnerable people writ large. If we do so, this story that has been used against gay people might instead be used to defend them against persecution.",

Before that, basically all documents have to be read in the context of a totalizing patriarchy.\n\nAnd I earnestly hope that several hundred years from today, human society is in a place where they read our historical documents with a better and more egalitarian understanding of humanity that we have now.",

What i think the original point was that these stories are being taken out of context, your point is that we are not understanding the underlying moral of these stories and picking the wrong parts, I think. \n\nAs readers we should look for deeper meaning in stories if we are going to get the most out of them, but what are the story author's responsibilities? When you throw in daughter rape into a moral story about respecting travelers, are you adding anything or distracting. At what point can we say this guy is giving excuse and cover for folks to rape, rather than tell a very important story about protecting the vulnerable. By the way, the moral here is bogus because I am sure the daughters are vulnerable too. You are saying Lot putting the safety of travelers over his own family and getting rewarded for it tells us the importance of protecting the vulnerable travelers, but I would argue it tells us that its cool to let women be raped as long as you have a \"good\" reason. If I randomly threw in someone justifying rape into a moral story, you might look at me sideways and say, this dude is just into rape. \n\n Your example of folks drowning is 100 times better and probably would never be misinterpreted.",

Not really much to say, but there is a pretty rad reading in which the first part you have is god making this genderless thing that is both male and female (the likeness of god, being a genderless/trans/non-gendered entitity).

Like literally split down the middle, so that we now have a back. (There's other super strange things, such as an idea that abraham and sarah didn't have genitals until god created them for them: 'the rock from which you were hewn, and the hole/quarry from which you were dug'.

Right-wingers (when Trump was running in 2016 and before they got to where they are now) used that story to justify backing Trump.\n\nThe context of the story makes it clear that this is a message about not despairing when seemingly wicked people are in charge as God can use them to (\u201cTrust the Plan\u201d and all).

How can you have a Bible, believe it's real, and not have *literally* memorized it? It's not like science, science is \"useful\" and \"cool\" to the people that believe in it so a casual understanding that covers your needs is fine. Christianity at least is about a specific person that has absolute power and infallibility, knows/cares about every atom in your body, is the source of any meaning at all that can be found in existence and you can't be bothered to read his book? Wtf why would you ever do anything else?",

The Bible is important because people told you so but don't worry about finding out what's in it for yourself. God loves you personally and is absolutely magic in everyway but don't worry about most of his manual, here's the snippet we picked for you this week. Surprise, it says be nice but don't worry about making any big or inconvenient changes to your life. Just make sure you give us some money so we can keep providing this valuable service. Don't worry about those people picking different snippets, they're wrong. No I don't have any credentials qualifying me to say my snippets are better cherry picked than theirs, but don't mine *feel right* to you? Don't think about it too much or you'll realize that having to create content that feels right to your viewers to maintain viewership is probably not going to create a very faithful message after 2000+ years of being an entertainment industry. Also don't worry about how the other people's snippets *feel right* to that congregation. They're just a little lost, but still on the same team! Who cares if God meant A or B by this passage? Not like he's the only absolute thing in existence. Not like his literal words are each so important and powerful that they create reality. Small potatoes, man! Don't spend your valuable time on the Bible, just love and be humble!\n\nBtw God is literally in the room with you when you jerk off. Sure he forgives you or whatever but my mom would forgive me for jerking off and I still wouldn't do it while she's watching. Almost like I believe my mom is real and Christian masturbators are subconsciously pretending.",

Anyone who reads the Bible, \"Walk in my ways and I will protect you\", notwithstanding, knows better than this ... hell, ask *Job**.* God wouldn't even let Jesus pray His way out of getting arrested and crucified.\n\nThe point of faith is to allow you to handle those situations better.",

To adults, who've seen many worse things in our lives, it seems odd or even humorous that something so mild could elicit such a response. But in the child's mind it may be the worst thing that's ever happened to them. \n\nWith this all in mind is it possible to create a world without evil? I would say no, not as we know it.

Unfortunately that requires us to guess that that is the situation as there's no logical way to show that.

Demons are literally fallen angels. Allow me to quote from Revelation 12:\n\n> ^7 Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. ^8 But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. 9 The great dragon was hurled down\u2014that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, **and his angels with him**.\n\nIf you backtrack three verses to verse four of that same chapter, you learn that 1/3 of all angels rebelled against god and followed Satan. **That's a staggeringly large exercise of free will by beings that had full knowledge of god and lived in his presence!**\n\nI suggest you read your bible more carefully.",

Your bible states that 1/3 of all angels rebelled against god. That's a clear demonstration that angels have free will. Whether or not you know their names is irrelevant.\n\nRegardless, you're wrong about this claim too.\n\nThere's the Catholic bible that includes Raphael, Asmodeus, etc among its canon in the Book of Tobit. And many Protestants (e.g. Lutherans, Methodists, etc) include this book among their deuterocanon.\n\nOf course if you're Eastern Orthodox then you'll include the Book of Enoch that lists TONS of angels, e.g., \u201c*And then Michael, Uriel, Raphael, and Gabriel looked down from heaven and saw much blood being shed upon the earth, and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth*\u201d.\n\nBut I suspect that, despite constituting the majority of christians worldwide, all those groups aren't *true christians* in your mind and thus you ignore them?\n\nThat's ok. Your own bible lists the names of at least four angels. Go read about them on [christianity.com](https://www.christianity.com/wiki/angels-and-demons/what-are-all-the-names-of-angels-in-the-bible.html).\n\nEven when attempting to derail the conversation with irrelevancies, you still fail to know your own bible.\n\n> I really don\u2019t think that there\u2019s much that the nature of angels has to offer this discussion\n\nAngels serve as an example of beings who lived directly in god's presence, free of pain and suffering, and yet still had free will. That's in direct contradiction to your claim that pain and suffering are necessary for free will and that displays of god's power which eliminate pain and suffering would usurp human free will.\n\nYou made a claim. I provided counter-example which disproves your claim. Seems pretty relevant to me.\n\n> And once they were fallen, they weren\u2019t angels anymore.\n\nLOL!\n\nIs this the angelic version of \"they're not **true** christians\"?\n\nThis is exactly the sort of mental gymnastics I have come to expect from christians. That passage I quoted from Revelation even calls them \"angels\". You're literally arguing against your own bible, you adorable little heretic. ;-)",

I quote from the comment chain:\n\n**Another user:**\n\n> > [God] could literally just get to whatever conclusion he wants without subjecting all of humanity to pain and suffering.\n\n**You:**\n\n> God doing that might come at the price of your free will\n\nSo what does that word \"might\" mean in this context?\n\nIf something \"*might come at the price of your free will*\", then it also *might not*. But that's precisely my argument and I'm using angels as an example to prove that such a state (i.e. no pain and suffering but still allowing free will) is compatible with the christian belief system.\n\nUnless you're now in agreement with me (*NB: Are you?*), then despite the presence of \"might\" in your comment, you believe that such an act would necessarily result in usurpation of human free will.\n\n-----\n\n> I was raised a Protestant whose Bible didn\u2019t include the deuterocanon.

I'm merely a man who was raised christian and chose to read his bible carefully. Though I do appreciate the compliment.\n\n> please cite for me any other account which suggests that any one of the two-thirds of the angels who remained loyal to God was at any point restive or ambivalent in doing as God asks.\n\nI think you're somewhat misunderstanding what \"free will\" means.\n\nYou could, for example, obey every command that god ever gives you, never once deviating from his instructions, and yet still possess free will. Free will is about possessing the ability to make that choice, not about which option you choose.\n\nThe fact that some angels chose to disobey god serves as proof that such a choice was available to them, but it's the ability to choose, rather than the choice they selected, that equates to free will.\n\nLet me put it another way: I don't think that free will is actually compatible with an all-knowing god, for if god knows your choice in advance, then you aren't actually free to choose differently otherwise god wouldn't be all-knowing. Thus, both the angels that rebelled and the angels that obeyed both lacked free will since their choices were preordained by god's perfect knowledge of future events.\n\nIt's not about which choice you make, it's about having the freedom to make a choice in the first place.\n\nQuoting from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will):\n\n> Free will is the capacity of agents to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded.\n\nThat article explain it pretty clearly, and there are sub-categories within the general category of \"free will\" that explore slightly different versions.\n\nOf course that entire argument that 'all-knowing' is incompatible with 'free will' is a whole other thing than the discussion we were having, but I thought you might want to explore just what 'free will' actually means. Since you believe humans have free will, you are forced to disagree with me on that point and that's why, for the discussion we were having, I used the angel's rebellion as a counter-example that still fits within your underlying belief system.",

Since these people continue to exist and horrible things continue to happen, therefore God either exists and is such a horrible being that we should not pay Him any attention, or he does not exist at all.\n\nIt is, I think, possible to argue from your point that since at any moment multiple courses of action are available to us, God does not know what we're going to do and is thus possibly *not* all-knowing.\n\nI think it might also be possible to argue a middle point: that He is \"all-knowing\" in the sense that we ourselves are in more limited situations: with another individual we know, we can anticipate (or think we can) how they will respond to a particular event and prepare our own responses. (for example, a pitcher will be planning for what to do if a fast runner is taking a huge lead off first with no one out: he can attempt to pick the runner off, throw the pitch normally with the expectation that the runner is not trying to steal, or throw the pitch normally with the expectation that the runner will go for second as he winds up). God, likewise, might anticipate a lot more reactions and a lot more of what happens when a great number of different people react and interact in a situation with thousands of possible combinations of outcomes. Assuming He is always correct in his assumptions, or has planned His response to every possible outcome he can foresee, it will always seem to us as if he knew what was going to happen. So, we can have free will and (Or could we be said to in such a situation?) an apparently all-knowing God.",

This even includes unborn children still in their mother's womb, children who haven't even had an opportunity to sin, yet who are condemned for future actions.\n\nThe only justification for this in the bible is that god has 100% perfect foreknowledge of the actions you will take. For if god doesn't have this 100% perfect knowledge of the future, then he is murdering people even though they might have chosen to repent and turn from their ways at some point in the future.\n\nSo you see, postulating the type of god you just described, would be to postulate a monster. Either the christian god is justified in commanding genocide/infanticide because he has perfect knowledge of the future, or he's a monster that condemns infants to death without giving them a chance to learn about him and join his flock.\n\n-----\n\nOf course, if we don't have free will, then god is also pretty monstrous because it means he created the majority of humans without the ability to come to him, instead condemning them to damnation with no chance at redemption.",

But that same knowledge made them capable of taming the harsher world outside and thriving in it.\n\nSo, you *could* argue that God expected that to happen \u2026 I mean, why else would you plop a huge tree in the middle of the garden and say \u201cyou can eat from every tree but this one.\u201d?

Then why even listen to anything he says? What's even the point of any of the scripture when if it says black it could mean white, stop could mean go, and good could actually mean evil? I can find a better moral guide in Bob Ross' Joy of Painting reruns. I mean if I put some 5 year old kids in a room with a jar of candy and tell them not to eat it, and then they eat it anyway so I tell them that they're bad and send them to their rooms, but I really actually secretly wanted them to eat it... does that not sound terribly emotionally abusive to you?

Uncertainty comes from the non-unitary measurement evolution.\n\nA phenomenon that is both deterministic and local must satisfy the Bell inequality...which quantum physics violates. This means that you must give up at least one: locality or determinism. Since without locality it becomes impossible to talk about causality, most people prefer not to give it up, and instead give up determinism.\n\nThe tone of certainty in your unprompted diatribe leads me to believe you learned everything you know about quantum physics from podcasts. Try some philosophy pods and maybe you'll see that determinism is indeed still a topic of serious debate for scholars ;)",

If you want a fresh example of why you're silly:\n\nQuantum mechanics doesn't \"break\" Newton. He holds up fine in macro. He just can't explain the micro. Take the double slit Quantum eraser test for example: The results show that particle states were preDETERMINED. There are Quantum phenomena like entanglement that lend credibility to determinism, and others such as vacuum fluctuation that remove credibility. This is why only clickbait articles that side step deeper issues will say that free will is backed up by quantum theory. We simply do not know, and thus the debate continues where quantum physics and philosophy meet.\n\nStop saying Newton is broken. He holds up for JPL just fine...we just do not have a unified theory yet. Does this help you become un-triggered?",

It can't be satan, because a loving, all powerful god would have destroyed him by now, theres no point in not doing so. It can't be to test us, because he's all knowing, he should know. And it can't be because its required for the universe to exist, because then he would not be omnipotent, as he would not be able to change the rules of the universe that he himself created. The reason i think that god would have to be omnipotent, as it is said in the bible multiple times, and frankly, it would make much more sense for god to be able to just put \"immense power\" or something like that, rather than put stuff saying \"nothing is impossible for god\" and forcing your followers to twist wording to reach the conclusion of \"well that wasn't exactly literal\" it looks extremely shady, and I think an all knowing being would understand that too.

You can choose to believe in whatever makes you happy. This is simply *my* interpretation of how God works, so try to have an open mind. \n\nIf you have children, you could lock them up in  their rooms, pad all the walls and floors, and never let them leave. You can give them all the food they need. Make sure that everything is sterile as a hospital room. They\u2019d never get sick. They\u2019d never get injured. But they\u2019d be missing out on *life*. \n\nAccording to the Biblical narrative, God placed Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden with everything they needed. They could live a perfect, conflict-free life. They could live as long as they wanted with no worries, sickness, or pain\u2014as long as they did not eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. \n\nThe tempter says that if they eat of the fruit of the tree, they \u201cshall be as the gods, knowing good and evil.\u201d\n\nGod absolutely *could* snap his fingers and make everything go away. But that\u2019s not the point.\n\nRegardless of whether or not you believe the story of Adam and Eve actually happened, there is a poignant lesson to be learned: **can you know good without knowing evil?** Can you know pleasure without pain? Happiness without sorrow? \n\nAt some point, every one of us must \u201cpartake of the fruit,\u201d metaphorically speaking, so as to comprehend that everything has its opposites. \n\nDoing everything in your power to make sure that your kids never make mistakes or never get hurt *sounds* nice, but is ultimately harmful for their development. You have to let people make mistakes, and then let them learn from them. \n\nSome people will learn. And some people won\u2019t. But God still loves us, and loves us too much to take away our freedom to choose. \n\n*But* mercy comes with Jesus. Someday, he *will* snap his fingers and cleanse the world of sin. I DO NOT think this means he\u2019ll chuck all the \u201cbad guys\u201d in a pit of fire and brimstone, but I believe it means he will do what you say: \u201csnap his fingers and make all the pain and suffering go away.\u201d \n\nBut he needs us to learn *first*. That\u2019s the point of our earthly existence. To learn how to be happy *ourselves*. It\u2019s not true happiness if someone forces it on you.",

And he is malevolent. If he is malevolent, maybe god is the devil and the devil is god, and we're in an abusive relationship with the devil who has managed to persuade us that up is down and that evil is good. That'd be pretty cunning. Evil wouldn't go around being obviously evil, it would masquerade as good while every now and again letting the mask slip. For instance, with the behaviour of evil's followers, or things like be A-Ok with genocide, mass murder, rape, and slavery (all condoned by god in the OT).",

In Christianity it's a direct creation of God, but also not from God because free will, but God has a plan and we can't stray from that so we don't have free will, but evil people act against and stray from God's plan... It's all extremely contradictory.\n\n> What would a reality without suffering look like?\n\nWell now we're straying into a more general philosophical discussion. Personally, as an atheist, I believe that suffering isn't an inherent part of existence, but a consequence of the distribution of resources, people with fewer resources will suffer, those with it will not. Greed compounds that suffering as people with plenty keep it from those without. In the end, suffering is something that we as a species must work to overcome and that overcoming that suffering will allow us to freely seek our own enlightenment without struggling to survive in the meantime. Life itself is worth living, regardless of whether or not there is suffering or death. Just like you don't have to experience great sadness to feel happy because happiness has meaning in and of itself. And some would argue that in order to have a concept of happiness you need to have a concept of sadness, and I would agree to a point, but disagree in that you don't need to understand that you're feeling happy to benefit from feeling it. If I had never felt pain in my life I may not know what pain is, but it still wouldn't detract from my life to lack the experience.",

Whereas with Christianity, God is a sentient all powerful being with a will and motivations. Suffering being a part of reality, which has no will or motivation to be that way, is different than a sentient being willingly letting suffering exist, despite having the power to end it, for the sake of some grand plan.",

If I never had to face unpleasantness it doesn't detract from my life, I can't explain pleasantness but that doesn't mean that my life isn't better off that way. If someone experienced nothing but unpleasantness in their life they wouldn't have a concept for what \"pleasant\" is, but that doesn't mean their life *isn't* a miserable existence. To them it would just be their life. My point is that life doesn't *need* suffering to be enjoyable, that life itself is meaningful in itself whether or not you know what good/evil pleasant/unpleasant is. The way we *use* our life is what determines if our life was meaningful, not how much we suffered while we lived.",

It's just a series of chemical reactions and there's no real intent behind the action, just a stimulus and a response to that stimulus.\n\nIn the end though, you could make an argument that everything is predetermined by the starting conditions of the Universe and the natural evolution of those conditions through adherence to the physical laws of the universe. You could theoretically predict any event that's going to happen in the universe simply by knowing the position and velocity of every particle in the universe at any given instant of time. But Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that having that knowledge is impossible, thus even if the universe is predeterministic it's impossible to have the predetermined knowledge. But it would in essence mean that no one truly has free will and we are all a consequence of the natural evolution of matter interacting within the bounds of the laws of physics and thus suffering *is* inherent in existence. But I like to believe that we have some control, limited as it may be, and we should do what we can to lessen or eliminate that kind of suffering.\n\nAs a techno-nerd myself, I too hope to one day achieve the communist world portrayed in Star Trek. That to me would be the best possible world. But until we have the ability to produce things without the necessity of labor we won't ever be able to fully achieve that.",

One of the most pathetic cop outs to avoid actually addressing obvious contradictions.\n\n> Your position is egocentric\n\nI'm not the one who created beings to worship me, and create similar beings who wouldn't worship me just so I can play out my self aggrandizing power fantasy and punish them when they don't do exactly what I designed them not to do. I'm not the one going around effectively saying \"I love you so much that if you don't love me back I'll lock you in my basement and torture you for eternity.\" Seriously how fucking messed up is it that I can live a noble and good life and still burn in hell simply because I didn't believe in some being who refuses to show himself (despite having the power to) and knew when he supposedly created me that I wouldn't believe. And you're calling me egotistical?\n\n> You don\u2019t know all the parts of existence, and you don\u2019t know any other types of reality, so you can\u2019t insist what a better reality is.\n\nYeah, Leibnitz didn't prove shit about \"other realities\" and I'm not concerned with realities that we don't even have evidence to even sightly suggest their existence, let alone prove it. So I'm not going live in suffering willingly just for the sake of some \"other reality\" that likely doesn't even exist.\n\n> But you think human suffering is so much more important than the fabric of time and space. \n\nWhat the duck are you even going on about? My original point was that if God was benevolent and omnipotent then he would have the power to do anything he wanted. He could make it so that brings didn't have to suffer without sacrificing anything from his \"grand plan\" or are you suggesting that there are things that God can't do so he has no choice to let it be this way? In which case he's not omnipotent. And if he does have the power to end suffering and refuses to do so, then he's not benevolent and didn't deserve to be worshipped.\n\nBut I've made my stance on Christianity clear, I think it and other religions are dangerous to society and has been used to justify some of the most atrocious acts in history. I'm unapologetically atheist and your will *never* convince me that God as any religion today describes him, exists. I'm going to live my life as if I don't get an eternity in Paradise on the basis of saying some words and not whether or not you actually deserve it, so go prosthelytize someone else. Or better yet: don't!",

Human nature simply is. If god chose to make humans as we are or not, we\u2019ll never know. What we do know is humans yearn to worship something.

It doesn\u2019t prove or disprove anything about god. It merely states that you refuse to view the concept of god objectively",

I was saying the biblical description of God is contradictory in that a benevolent God who supposedly loves us as much as Christians claim then he wouldn't enact a plan that requires suffering, and if he did then he isn't benevolent, and if he couldn't enact a plan without suffering then he isn't omnipotent.\n\n> I provided a different context as to the nature of god in a thread discussing the nature of god.\n\nI wasn't discussing the nature of God, I was adding to a discussion about the contradictory nature of the Bible and Christian ideologies regarding God's supposed benevolence and omnipotence.\n\n> I proved that wrong.\n\nProof requires evidence, you've provided nothing other than irrelevant conjecture about how *maybe* we just don't understand the reason for the suffering and that trying to argue that God should take action is egotistical. Which again, is irrelevant because if God is omnipotent then there is nothing that is outside his ability to do, which means it is possible to achieve whatever goal he wants just by using his power to make it so, no suffering needed, unless his intention was to make us suffer in which case the label \"benevolent\" doesn't apply.\n\n> You then went off on an unrelated and insulting tangent about how god doesn\u2019t exist\n\nWhere did I insult you? Unless you took offence at me saying God doesn't exist, but if you don't believe in him then why is that an issue? But I never insulted you. Actually you were the one that threw out insults saying my position is egocentric. \n\n> in a thread discussing the possible nature of god where we\u2019re all debating acting the premise, \u201cif god exists\u201d.\n\nThe whole thread is in mockery of the person in the OP saying God didn't create evil, when the Bible says he created evil, that by creating humans with free will, and having all knowledge of all things that will come to be, he knew he was creating evil. The assumption of the premise that God exists was only done as a way to point out the contradictions and problems with that assumption and the logic Christians use to defend it. A benevolent God that has infinite power and wisdom wouldn't make his creations capable of evil, unless he wanted evil to exist, but then that's not benevolent. My whole arguement from the first comment I made on this post is that the Christian ideology of God as a benevolent and omnipotent/omniscient being is contradictory and thus ridiculous. If you didn't get that then you've been arguing against a strawman this whole time.",

                                  "text": "> When you read a book do you decide what the characters do?\n\nGod isn't reading a book, he's the damn author. You don't read a book who you know was written by an author and say the characters have free will. If every action you take or thought you have is known before you're even born then you don't actually have free will, because your life is known it's predetermined. You can't have a predetermined life *and* be able to make your own choices. And if we were designed to act or think in a specific way by someone who knows that our design will make us act or think in that same way it's not free will. It's not that hard a concept. If God knows everything we're going to do, especially because that's how he designed us, then we don't actually have free will. If we were capable of acting in a way that God didn't expect, like someone with true free will would, then God wouldn't be all knowing as the Bible claims he is.\n\n> If you watch your friend or child make a mistake, is it your fault because they did that?\n\nIrrelevant. I'm not a being that claims to be omnipotent and omniscient, nor did I create my friend or design my child, nor did I know everything they were going to do. If I knew everything my friend or child was going to do before they did it and I still let them make that mistake then yes, it would be my fault. Just like if your friend tells you that they plan to murder someone and you do nothing and they go ahead with that plan, you're an accomplice, because you had foreknowledge of your friend's actions and did nothing to stop it.\n\n> If no matter what they do they still make a mistake, and you cant do anything but physically prevent them from taking action is it your fault?\n\nAgain, irrelevant, because I don't claim to be omnipotent or omniscient. But we're talking about God, who *does* claim to be omnipotent and omniscient. Are you suggesting that God knows what his creations are going to do but has no ability to stop it? Well then he's not omnipotent. Are you suggesting that God has the power to stop it but doesn't because he didn't know that his creation was going to act that way? Well then he's not omniscient. You can't have it both ways, you can't have a God who has knowledge of everything and the power to control everything and simultaneously have a god that doesn't have the power to know what his creations are going to do or the power to stop it once he does.\n\n> Would you enact violence, the removal of choice, from your loved ones because they might mess up?\n\nAgain, we're talking about God, not me a lowly human that has never claimed to know everything or be all powerful, and God created us knowing everything we're going to do. Which means God made a choice in creating our friend in a way that they would make a mistake. There was no choice on the part of my friend, it was all predetermined. So yes it would be God's fault for creating someone in a way that he knows will eventually make a mistake and then punishing them for making the mistake he knew ahead of time they were going to make.\n\n> Whos wrong then?\n\nGod.",

None of these actions can be explained as a mysterious, necessary part of a larger plan, because an omnipotent being doesn't need a plan.  It doesn't need to overcome obstacles or evade traps.\n\nWhen infants die of horrifying wasting disease, screaming in pain while their parents look on helplessly until they die, God did that on purpose.  No mysterious plan could require that, because God has no restrictions on his power.\n\nIs that just to, what, make us afraid?  That's the act of a childish bully, not an all-caring father.",

                  "text": "One of my favorite allegories is that of the man and the hurricane. I'm recounting this from memory and adding a whole lot of embellishment, so I might get stuff wrong, including the title. Take a seat, it's a long one:\n\nOne day, a man is watching the news in his living room when he hears that a hurricane is approaching his coastal town. A bad one, too. The meteorologists are practically begging people to evacuate until it blows through. His wife sees this and begins making plans to drive up to her sister's home a few hours inland, but her husband stops her.\n\n\"We don't need to evacuate,\" he says to her, \"We are the most faithful Christians in town. We are servants of God and I know that he will protect us through this challenge. We're staying here and riding it out.\"\n\n\"Pete, they said the storm surge is gonna be crazy high. If you want to stay here, that's fine by me, but I'm taking the kids up to my sister's till it's over, and you have until we leave to change your mind,\" says his wife.\n\n\"If it makes you feel safer, you can go, but know that you are doubting God. If it gets messy, I know The Lord will come to save me.\"\n\nAnd so, his family evacuates and Pete remains in his home, awaiting the storm.\n\nAs the hurricane makes landfall, the waters are already reaching the top of his driveway. He says a short prayer and as soon as he finishes, he hears some shouting. There is a man in a tall pickup truck driving past his house, leaving a large wake in the waters behind it.\n\n\"Sir, you need to get out of here, let me give you a ride while the water's still low! It's only gonna get worse from here!\"\n\nPete chuckles and says, \"Thank you, but I have faith in God and I know he will get me out of this!\"\n\nThe man shrugs and drives away, searching for anyone else who needs help.\n\nA few hours later, the water has risen. It is now waist-deep on the first floor of his house, so he has to move some valuables up to the second floor along with himself. He continues praying for The Lord to save him, and as he brings up the last of the objects that matter most, he hears more shouting from outside. He opens a window on the second floor and sees a man on a canoe.\n\n\"Sir, let me get you out of here, the water's still not done rising! I have room in here for one person, but I might be able to fit a small backpack if you have anything you need to bring!\"\n\n\"No thank you,\" shouts Pete, \"I have faith in God and I know he will get me out of this!\"\n\nThe man is shocked but wastes no time paddling downstream to find someone in need of a way to escape.\n\nSoon after, the waters reach much higher than the weathermen even predicted and it shows no signs of slowing. The surface is so high, Pete is forced to take the absolutely necessary objects and documents up to the roof, where he continues to pray to God that he save him from this mess. As he is praying, he hears a constant droning noise getting louder and louder until it is deafening. A rope ladder drops beside him.\n\n\"Sir, this is the coast guard,\" He hears above him. It's a helicopter hovering over his house. \"We're here to get you out of here! Don't worry, you're going to be alright!\"\n\nHe struggles to shout over the roar of the propellers, \"Thank you so much for coming out here, but I'll be fine! I have faith in God and I know he will get me out of this!\"\n\nThe coast guards look at each other confused and give him one last chance before flying away to conserve fuel, as they have many more rescues to perform.\n\nPete continues praying to God, imploring Him to get him out of this. He will not let these people take away his faith, as he will only accept salvation from The Lord. He has tremendous faith in Him and knows that he will come through and lead him to safety. In fact, this never happens at all. The floodwaters rise and rise until they reach their peak some ten or so feet above his roof, and he succumbs to the raging current, drowning to death.\n\nPete opens his eyes to a blinding white light. It takes some time for his eyes to adjust, but when they do, he sees before him a colossal golden gate, adorned with beautiful vines. He tries to put his hand down, but finds nothing to set it on; He is floating atop a weightless cloud. He is at the gate to heaven.\n\nHe is led inside and wanders around until he finds who he is looking for: God. He approaches Him and begins asking questions, almost angrily.\n\n\"Lord, I have spent my entire life remaining faithful to you, spreading your word and bringing your will to the world! Why did you abandon me to die? I have never doubted you, not even for a second!\"\n\n\"Ah, you have indeed been a very faithful man. You were almost the perfect role model of what it truly means to be good at heart. But you did doubt me, Pete. Several times, in fact.\"\n\n\"When? I don't recall-\"\n\n\"You asked me to save you. To get you got of 'this mess' time and time again. Thus, seeing as you have led a humble, faithful life, I gave you several opportunities to escape: I sent you the warning of the storm with ample time to leave; I sent you a kind stranger to drive you to safety with his truck; I sent you a man risking his life to paddle you to safety in his canoe; I even sent you the Coast Guard as one last chance to fly you to safety. But you doubted, Pete, that these were sent by me. You doubted that they were my angels, brought to you to save you. You doubted my plan, and I knew then that there would be nothing else I could send you that would open your eyes to my salvation, Peter. Ye of little faith.\"",

God as some super teddy bear is very much *not* the impression you get from reading the Bible. Faith is about finding your way to reconcile the God of the Bible with the notion that He can care about you. It's not easy, it isn't supposed to be, and trying to sugarcoat it with the idea that God only makes good things leaves people with a dangerously Pollyanna-ish notion of reality.\n\n\"*He who made kittens* / *Made snakes in the grass*\" (and no, this is not meant as a literal endorsement of creation but as a symbolic point, as I'm sure Ian Anderson intended it).",

Because sure, lets say that god can poof up some energy and matter, can set the universal constants to be whatever they want, they can know everything there is to know... but can't change the fact that 1+1=2. Let's say God has to personally intervene every time 1+1 is anything other than 2. We're setting up the universe as a doll house, and we also apparently solve every theological problem. \n   \nFor the sake of simplicity, let's assume that the universe is finite in mass and energy, and that each particle can only be in a finite number of states, and matter can only be organized in a finite number of ways.  \nWell, no matter how unfathomably big the number is, there's a finite series of states the universe could be in.  \nIf one was able to hold all those universal permutations in mind at once with perfect clarity and understanding, then what is the difference between a thought and what's \"real\"?   \nTo a being like that, thought and reality are the same. To a being outside time and space, even what we would call quantum randomness is functionally the same as being deterministic.   \n  \nPeople also try to break the idea of omniscience by questioning how Free Will squares with that, but that doesn't make sense if you think about it like the above: Perfect knowledge of all possible states of a finite system. Time would be irrelevant. You technically have choices, but all possible choices have been made, will be made, and are being made. All possible interventions have happened, will happen, and are currently happening.  \n \nIf you believe that there's anything like actual \"Free Will\" and that the universe isn't deterministic, how do you validate blaming god for people's choices? Either god has his hand up your ass and you're a puppet, or you have free will and are free to act as good or shitty as you choose. Logically you can't have both \"only good\" and \"actual freedom\" across all iterations of the universe.   \nWhere does evil come from? Evil as you perceive it is a possible state in a possibly universe, and therefore it has always been, will always be, and currently is.\n    \nI don't assert that there's a god, or any godlike beings, but I do assert that merely the supposition of god leads to lines of thought where the only rational thing to do is not worry about god one way or another. God simultaneously matters and doesn't matter because you are god talking to yourself.",

But they still allow us to be tortured for eternity if we don't do it right.  \n  \nAre we really \"tortured for eternity\" though?  \nYou're still looking at things from a ridiculous narrow Christian point of view. The above transcends mere Christian notions. Christianity could be simultaneously true in one universe, and perhaps in a different permutation of the universe Christianity is the confluence of historical accident, combinations of other religions, and total fabrication. In one universe god intervened, in the other god did not intervene and exactly the same story came about by accident.    \n  \nMaybe hell is real, maybe not. It's not any part of the material universe that we know of.  An eternal hell isn't a logical extension of physical reality as we know it. Really the idea of an immortal soul which is somehow distinct from your physical form also has no meaning, as far as current scientific understanding would have it. You are \"eternal\", in that there is a \"you\" that exists in every possible state, across all universes where \"you\" was a possibility that became actual.   \n   \nWith the above given definition of god, in order to keep you \"alive\" in hell for eternity, the god would have to continually pump energy into that system to keep it running.   \nThat's a possibility, yet at the same time there would have to be an equal number of \"you\"s which are eternally in Heaven, and an equal number in Purgatory.  \nAt this point we're talking about things outside normal space-time, which is entirely up for grabs.  \n  \nEven when you consider an afterlife, we come to an a nearly undeniable mind-bending mess. You're always alive, you're always dead, you're always in Heaven, you're always in Hell. All states exist alongside each other. \n \nThe point: it's nothing worth worrying over.  \n  \nOf course, from this perspective, some of you are going to worry about it anyway, and some of you will get angry, and some of you will have an epiphany that I'm right and go eat a celebratory hot dog, and some of you will have been hit by a meteor before being able to read this.",

Most don't bother.\n\nI think that the Bible paints a very different, more intricate picture of god than just some all powerful being that plays duck duck damned. And without context, it does seem absolutely horrible. But taking the worst part of the bible in our eyes without context can't do the entirety of the being of God justice. I don't think either of us would fairly compare the innermost being of who we are by focusing on the darkest point in our life. We would put who we are in the context of all we do and have done.\n\nIn the context of scripture, the Christian god creating people that he himself said were very good, who he gave free will, and then chose to live with, walk with, and have daily conversation with, it paints a different story. In Genesis, it says he created us to be who he is to us, but to the earth. He then told us to make the rest of the world just like he made the garden. He gave us his status, the ability to rule over all the earth, and then lived with us. Then the rest of the bible is us doing what he said not to do, and them him still creating a way for us the be together again, dispite our continued refusal and rebellion.\n\nYou don't have to agree with the context or anything, but this is the context a Christian would normally think of when thinking of their god. Most people who don't believe in the Christian God only focus on that one attribute. But that's like only focusing on parents being people that would condemn you to the worst thing they can think of for killing and raping their kid. Just as parenting isn't about hating and going after people that hurt your kids, God isn't just an over protective parent sending evil people to hell. (Not my best analogy, just the one off the top of my head.)",

Judaism describes omnipotent as being able to do all things within a nature and omniscient has been argued as capable of knowing all things, but not necessarily predetermining things (which i always thought was interesting when some physicists have argued that time isn't linear, our perception is. Some diety that exists forever might see shit differently). Either way, there are so many sects that it really is a spectrum of beliefs from rational and theoretical to spiritual and then to crazy and manipulative and vendictive.The neckbeard \"but semantics says your wrong\" shit should never part of the equation, its a translation of a translation and the real ones are constantly searching for meaning, they dont just have everything set in stone. \n\nJust let the people worship however they want unless its getting pushed on you or used to change politics. Which is always funny to me that some try, the Bible literally has a passage that says, \"What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?\u00a0God will judge those outside.\" Theyre really supposed to keep their laws to themselves, theyre meaningless to outsiders; outsiders wouldn't be going to heaven either way.",

Because it's confusing - if God is only good how does evil even exist? The answer may not be what you want, because the answer itself cannot be completely understood by a limited human being.\n\nHere's the paradox: Goodness exists because God desired it; evil exists because God *doesn't* want it.\n\nIf a human wants something, but doesn't actually do anything about it, nothing happens. You may want a piece of cake, but a cake will not materialize unless someone bakes it.\n\nBut when you're a Divine Being, your desires create reality. With God, just wanting something makes it exist. After all, He is all-powerful; if He wants it, what can possibly stop it from being? He wanted a world, so it was. He wanted goodness, so it was.\r  \n\r  \nNow the same applies to God not wanting something: it too becomes reality. If God decides He doesn't want something, then that decision itself makes that thing exist. God's all-powerfulness means that even His not-wanting creates. Evil is what God doesn't want. So it exists.\r  \n\r  \nBut evil doesn't exist in the same way that goodness exists. God wants goodness, so its existence is true and everlasting. Evil exists as a negative, something God doesn't want, so its existence is flimsy and temporal. Evil is no more than an undesirable non-entity, a path not to be taken. By doing evil acts, we give evil more credit than it deserves. Our bad choices make evil into a truer existence than it really is.\r  \n\r  \nIn the end, evil can't prevail. It is an unwanted ghost, a temporary illusion, a thin fa\u00e7ade. Over time evil dissipates, no matter how menacing it may seem. Wicked empires crumble, rotten ideas become exposed, and goodness eventually shines through. That's what God wanted all along, but He leaves it to us to achieve.",

          "text": "I was looking into it out of curiosity and decided to have fun trying to put it together. Wall of text incoming.\n\nSometimes the confusion comes from the translation selection. Translating particular words that might be read differently outside of english linguistics. So first thing I like to do is check the original wording of the manuscript. In this case, there's not really anything new. It really does mean evil, as it uses the same word to refer to:\n\n- \"the tree of good and evil\"  \n\"knowing good and evil\", and;  \n\"their thoughts were evil continually\" (regarding the flood)\n\nUsually this is where most issues are resolved, but not this one so let's dig further.\n\nSomething of note here is it also uses \"evil\" synonymously with words like \"mischief\", \"sorrow\", and \"displeasure\" in other verses which is interesting. So it's not just used for the **being** of evil, but something akin to the **actions/results** of evil. This is important because they may be talking about active/verb-like elements more than existence and states of being.\n\nSince this isn't a word used on its own, another thing we can do is look at the contrast to evil it lists, which is \"peace\". Something that immediately caught my attention is that it's not contrasting *good* to evil, but *peace* to evil. It does so in other areas, but why not this one? Because it seems to be talking about a wellness or a wholeness that relates more to being well put together. Not goodness as a being. Which is another reason to believe this isn't talking about the existence or being of evil either but we'll put this together later.\n\nAnd the last thing we should look at is the choice of connecting words:\n\n- He **forms** light  \nHe **creates** darkness\n\n- He **makes** peace  \nHe **creates** evil\n\nThese are actually huge clues to working through the puzzle. And it uses the same \"create\" in both comparisons to draw further parallels. The term \"create\" doesn't change much in original wordings. It means what it says for the most part.\n\nIn \"form\" it definitely uses the term as a fashioning or framing of an entity. To shape something. And \"make\" is probably the most important one; used as to literally \"do\" something/anything or to yield something like how fruit yields from a tree. But it's hard to interpret \"doing\" peace.\n\nIt's important to take these as their own chunked phrases as well. Singular units as \"forming light\" is to be attached to \"creating darkness\". This tells us that there are connecting elements being made. In this case, it could be said that it's contrasting one to the other as the verses before it definitely gives contrasting elements to what it connects to:\n\n- ...apart from me -> there is no God...  \n...I am the Lord -> and there is no other...\n\nWhereas before it may seem additive; creating one (e.g. light), and separately creating the other (darkness). Following the trend, we could interpret things as: Forming the light *therefore there is* darkness. Making peace *therefore there is* evil. It's almost comparing one to the other like making peace results in evil like creating light results in darkness and that's kind of hard to understand tbh, but that's just another layer of intrigue all on its own.\n\n---\n\nSo all this taken into account, a good way to interpret the verse might be:\n\n##*I form/fashion the light, and thereby create the resulting darkness; I yield wholeness/wellness, and thereby create the resulting unsoundness/sorrow*\n\nThis was fun. It may not be the most accurate, translations always take certain liberties, but I feel this gives more insight as to what's being communicated.",

Evil is a deprivation of the good, or put in another way, it exists only in the sense as depriving from goodness. The classic illustration is it is like a cavity on a tooth. It\u2019s almost a parasitic, decaying force. So it\u2019s wrong to say anyone \u201ccreated evil\u201d, evil is only a parasitic, decaying of the goodness that was created. \n\nExtending from that, in Christian tradition Satan was originally an angel who rebelled against God. This follows the Christian understanding of evil, that Satan was originally created good, yet turned from good. Satan likewise doesn\u2019t \u201ccreate evil\u201d, he simply warps God\u2019s good creation.",

I've hinted at the fact that, in a Christian understanding of God and his self-revelation in the Bible, that's not the case. There are other purposes for scripture that take precedence (this is even true if you're a student of religious history/anthropology from a totally atheistic/secular viewpoint).\n\nYou're basically arguing against a different God from the one presented by Christianity and the Bible. And that's fine by me - I don't believe in those gods either. Just don't think you've meaningfully engaged with what I or Christians through the centuries actually believe.

                  "text": "The purpose of the Bible may not be simply communicating facts, but it's the highest purpose on the list. Writing was absolutely invented to preserve knowledge and communicate facts. Even if the written work is a song, which can be spoken or sung is written to preserve the fact of itself as a thing to be preserved and communicated repeatedly.\n\n\nBut let's go further. The Bible as we know it is the canonization of many other written documents. It's a work of individual works. In some if those individual works the author states the purpose of writing to be for the preservation and communication of facts. That again moves us away from subjective purpose of the observer to distinctive purpose of the author to communicate facts.\n\n\nBut also who determines the purpose of the Bible? To make the argument it is God we must both agree it's the work of God, which we might not. So we see the argument here is based on some presupposition. And there's too much of that required to properly debate religion at all. In that case the purpose of the Bible is assigned by the present user, which in this case is me. I'm using the bible to create a litmus test against its own validity.\n\n\nThat's why I stated my personal litmus test. Most Christian church attendees and many non-christians agree the Bible says believers are supposed to be supernaturally different and they are definitely not. They are just like everyone else. The discrepancy between the new testament account of the lives of the early believers (first 100 years after the resurrection) and the entire history of the church is so large there's an entire doctrine explaining the difference, that also is not based on the Bible itself but is a working theory based on observations that conflict with the Epistles. \n\n\nSadly, there are very few historical texts concerning the early church that weren't written by Christians themselves. Josephus' history of Christianity is a favor among believers and is often referred to when early evidence is needed. However there's not much to counter the accounts. The emphasis of preservation was to preserve the facts, writings, texts, lore and rumor that would corroborate the legitimacy of the Bible, not refute it.\n\n\nSo a simple test is enough. A concordance isn't required. A parallel bible isn't required. A Wesleyan bible isn't required. A doctorate in theology isn't required. The dead sea scrolls aren't required. If believers believe the bible was written for common men to find heaven, a simple test should be enough as well. Doesn't that seem reasonable?",

I'd just say that the Bible itself gives various reasons for God's self-revelation, e.g. Jesus explaining the purpose of the parables. So either (supposing that it is from God) we need to revise our ideas about its purposes - or (supposing it's not from God) we can reject it as nonsense.\n\nIt's just that doing the latter doesn't really challenge the former. One has to step fully into the worldview of someone else and critique it on its own terms to decide whether it's internally coherent or not.",

So while you would expect God\u2019s direct word to have the power to evade any and all misunderstanding, it is still being communicated to us through an imperfect medium: human language. So while God Himself is perfect, none of us are perfect, so why would we expect to ever have a perfect understanding of something, divine or not? *Especially* when that understanding is being delivered through an imperfect medium like written and verbal human communication?\n\nThat probably sounds like a cop-out, but really, none of us truly knows *everything* about *anything*. There are going to be things imperfect humans simply don\u2019t fully understand about a perfect God. But reading the Bible and quoting it in its proper context is a step toward understanding it better than pulling things out of context and hoping for the best\u2014or worse, by taking them out of context and then arguing that they don\u2019t make sense.",

                              "text": "Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve made it clear you have no tolerance for religion. Makes my life easier\u2014I\u2019m not going to change your mind, so I don\u2019t need to try. \n\nBut to address this for anyone reading this comment chain: this counter argument above is dismissing the entire argument because it\u2019s taking a small snippet of Christian theology and running with it, without any of the *context* that makes it mean something. If you\u2019re not a Christian yourself, I don\u2019t blame you for being ignorant. But for those looking on, the reason (most) Christians believe in this fallibility of humanity is that God created us with free will to choose good or evil. Humanity chose evil. Because of that, we live in a broken world, plagued by disease, death, hatred, and all the other messed up things that make up this world we call home. Included in that fall from grace is that we no longer have a perfect relationship with the God that made us, so we *can\u2019t* have that perfect knowledge of Him that my comment partner is attacking. \n\nChristians believe humans screwed up. God knowingly provided us with a free will so He could have a relationship with His creation, rather than just have a bunch of robots running around saying how great He is, but we spit in His face and said we\u2019d rather do it our way. Because *all* humans have fallen short of perfection, we *all* bear a responsibility to pay the price for our imperfection\u2014namely, death. Jesus died to save us from that fate, to pay the price for the sin which we couldn\u2019t pay ourselves, and belief in His sacrifice (and repentance from sin) is what resolves the broken bond we have with our Creator and leads to eternity in heaven after death (though the restored relationship is really the core of that salvation, not eternity in paradise). That\u2019s the Christian gospel in a nutshell, so I\u2019ll stop evangelizing\u2014this isn\u2019t really the time or place, but I want anyone reading to have *context* for where this comes from. \n\nBecause we messed up, though, we don\u2019t have a perfect relationship with God. It\u2019s *our* fault, not God\u2019s. So no, God wasn\u2019t restricted from creating a message we could all understand because He did a bad job\u2014we messed up our relationship with Him to the point that we couldn\u2019t understand it anymore. That context *matters*. Whether you believe it or not, that\u2019s up to you. But the context means something for why Bible verses mean what they do. If you single out a single aspect of an argument and then refute that point out of context, you\u2019ve only proven yourself a fool, and you\u2019re being intellectually dishonest. If you disagree with the entire premise, that\u2019s fine. I won\u2019t make you change your mind. But at least consider the context of the argument before passing that judgment.",

My lack of respect is reinforced every time I get a wall of vague fuzzy feely BS like this. Your bizarre Stockholm syndrome with your imaginary daddy that beats you because it's your fault is just fucked. The obvious fact you conveniently skip is that in your story your god set up the whole thing and made all the rules. There is no reason for sin or suffering unless he wants it. There is no reason for any dumb sacrifice. When someone chooses, for no reason, to put you in a debt, then pays themselves back and demands you call them a hero for it or they'll torture you forever, that person is playing with you like a toy and is a monster. It's just so fucked I can't understand the spin you people put on it. We all owe a price to pay for our imperfection? What in the absolute fuck? Maybe I'll just choose to be perfect, can I do that? If I never had a chance to do that, then how the hell would that be on me? Why can't I? Who made the rules? If a person did these things to another person, it would just be so obvious that they were not good or perfect. So. Incredibly. Obvious. I would have at least some respect for you if you would say this whole thing is fucked but might makes right and God is the king even if he's a dick. I could follow that line of thought.\n\nAnd while you prance off saddened that I don't open my mind to your BS, I was raised in it. I've read it. I've discussed it in good faith with religious leaders I respected. I've done a lot of work and lived a life trying to figure out how this can possibly make sense and I just can't. It wasn't easy. It's not easy for a lot of people like me. You do not and have absolutely never tried to believe what I believe. I tried for years to understand and believe your side of this. Don't pretend to sit on a throne of truth and fairness. You are the one with the shut mind thinking up can be down if only you have all the *context* feel-good BS propaganda about why it is so. You are not having an effect because you are not telling me anything I haven't heard and considered at length, and I'm not having an effect because you can't hear anything you don't want to.\n\nHave you ever thought about what the world would be like in your story if the humans hadn't committed the sin? Do you think the god in your story would spend all of time reveling in the obedience of those two lobotomized children, feeling intense pleasure knowing they could have chosen to listen to that snake he made to tempt them but instead chose to follow the rules he made up for no reason? Soooo much better than the obedience of robots, right? Maybe he'd be disappointed, I mean what other reason would the tree have been put there for? Did God need it for shade? Maybe he liked to make pie from the fruit? It's so stupid.",

It does seem that biblically ground Christians are getting harder to find. \"They will come to me saying 'Lord, Lord', but I never knew you'. False Christians are a huge thing and they are disgustingly prevalent. They hurt those both interested and not interested in the faith. Take the lgbtqia+. A lot of Christians, I say because I don't know if they're actually Christians, don't practice the live Jesus touts. They feel like slapping someone with a Bible will turn them from their sinful ways, or something like that. But they need love. You need love. We all need love. They forget that. I'm sorry that you had these experiences. Sometimes, as I have found, you have to decide for your self what it means. Just as we have metaphors, the Bible has metaphors. It wouldn't be realistic if it didn't have metaphors and parables, as we still use today. You just have to learn, by text and knowing the circumstances of location and people, what it actually is.

A wise parent does not shield a child from every decision or make all decisions for that child. For example: the child likes a sport. The parent decides that they are going to let the child pursue the sport, giving all safety equipment to the child, the child still makes a risky decision and gets hurt. The parent knows that playing that sport probably will not benefit them that much in the future, they could be using that time studying, but is the parent wrong for allowing the child to try the sport even if it isn\u2019t the wisest choice of action or could lead to injury? No, because the parent has allowed the child to make the decision to go and do what it wants to do out  of his/her free will. Also out of love.",

As you continue to sideskirt the issue, if someone stops you from doing something and you are only allowed to take one path and think one way, you do not have free will. You are given the choice to do good or evil. \n\nIf you what you are saying is correct, then you are basically saying you personally are not accountable for any of your choices. So you could\nDo anything you want and you should not be held accountable because you are a mindless robot that has no choice in the matter. How is that in any way logical? \n\nI personally am very happy I was given the ability to decide if I want to be good. Decide what I want to do with my life. To me that is loving. \n\nThat last sentence you wrote also makes no sense. Not letting your child make any choices ever is insane and I can\u2019t imagine how their life would be in the future since they never learned how to make the right choice, it was always done for them. \n\nEven with us, god can tell us what the right choice is, but it\u2019s still up to us to make the right one, \u201cfree will\u201d (as per the original post)",

This person then goes to the future and sees the robot chose to kill a lot of people. Sure, you could say it's the robot's fault. \n\nBut then if the person went back in time again and built the robot the exact same way they know will cause this result, changing nothing at all and acting the same way even though they know the robot will kill people if they don't change anything, is this justified? No, of course not. At that point it's predetermined, and even if it was \"free will\" there was only one possible result.\n\nIf this person then later punished the robot (possibly ETERNALLY) for something they already knew it would do, I would say that robot is a LOT less at fault than it's creator.\n\nDo you think in real life, if we had a way to stop anyone from murdering anyone else (without harmful side effects) we WOULDN'T use it because of some sort of \"free will\"? No, that would be idiotic. If God is so all-powerful, he could definitely find out some way to do this. It really isn't necessary for murder to be possible. \n\n> Not letting your child make any choices ever is insane\n\nHow hard is it to understand that it isn't stopping them from making choices in general, it's specifically MURDERING OTHER HUMANS\n\nTo me it seems like you're the one sideskirting the issue\n\nEdit: a word",

Now say because this person is evil god gets rid of them, deletes them from existence. In turn people cry \u201cGOD KILLED SOMEONE\u201d he has done something no one else has ever done, he is a murderer, he is evil! Now everyone decides to go against god and try to kill god, are they all evil? They are all attempting murder. God deletes them all. Is he wrong to do so? None of them ever learned the difference between good and bad, right form wrong. Because nothing wrong has ever happened.\n\ngod creates a man, sees its entire fate and existence, it\u2019s not to what he likes so he gets rid of it and starts making a new one, he creates another, sees it\u2019s entire existence and it\u2019s exactly what he wants it to do, did both humans have free will? The answer is no. \n\nYour analogy is hilarious here talking about robots, considering they have the opposite of free will.\n\nYou clearly just don\u2019t want humans to have free will at all, I kind of find that fascinating.

Whenever I see a verse that is being used in a certain way I go and look it up and read the verses around it to check to see if it is being taken out of context. The Hebrew and Greek languages which the Bible was mainly written in has words that the English language doesn't have so other similar words are put in place. So whenever a verse has a certain wording that I think may not be the correct wording I go and look at a different translation of the Bible. And last but not least the viewed from that time part. When Jesus was born into this world and sacrificed himself for us many of the old laws and restrictions weren't needed anymore. So if you are looking at a law from the Old Testament there is a chance that it was changed.",

Jesus is God. It can get very confusing. Jesus was born into this world 100% human while also being 100% God, still very confusing there is really nothing to compare it to for it to make more sense. Jesus was raised up in this world facing all the challenges and temptations that man did. Jesus didn't sin, he is the very definition of perfect.  That is why Jesus was the sacrifice that was needed to cover all of man's future sins. Jesus gave his life so that we can get to the Father. he bridged the gap that sin created, and it is only through Jesus that we can get to the Father. Three days after Jesus died he rose from the dead conquering death",

It\u2019s something that I\u2019ve had questions about myself.\n\nI used to be the \u201cyou can\u2019t be *truly* happy unless you love Jesus,\u201d kind of person, but I have moved past that. Now I just kinda think that, ultimately, God just wants you to be happy. If you aren\u2019t happy as a Christian, I\u2019d say try to figure it out, and if it doesn\u2019t work out, it doesn\u2019t work out. Find what makes *you* happy, man. \n\nBut I\u2019ll share a perspective I got from a theology teacher I had years back: he shared a story about how he bought some popsicles and put them in the freezer. He had a young son at the time (like 4 or 5 years old). The teacher told his son \u201cyou have to wait until after dinner to eat a popsicle.\u201d But, sure enough, a couple hours later, he could hear from the next room the sound of a popsicle being opened. \n\nDid this father know that his son was going to try to take a popsicle from the freezer? Yeah, probably. Did that take away this kid\u2019s agency? No.\n\nJust because God knows what\u2019s going to happen, it\u2019s still *our* choices. Even if we screw up sometimes, he loves us too much to take away our freedom to choose, even if it means we sometimes (oftentimes) choose wrongly. \n\nThe BIGGEST thing here is the fact that Jesus is central to his plan. Jesus\u2019 suffering and death means that all the suffering that *we* go through ultimately *doesnt matter*. \n\nGod says: \u201chey, you\u2019re gonna go to earth and live your lives. For most of you, it\u2019s really gonna suck. But it\u2019ll be good for you, because no matter what, it\u2019ll be a learning experience. You\u2019ll *all* screw up and *all* become irredeemable. But it\u2019s okay, because I will prepare a Redeemer for you. Eventually, it will make the pain and suffering *disappear* completely. No matter how bad you screwed up. It doesn\u2019t even matter if you didn\u2019t want to follow Jesus. I will save you anyway. Because I love you.\u201d",

The father may have known it was likely his kid would disobey and eat the popsicle, but the father had very little control over the composition of the child\u2019s personality, and has limited control over the child\u2019s experience. So whether or not the child disobeys is not really up to him. On the other hand, an all powerful and all knowing god would have complete control over the circumstances leading up to the decision. Not to mention the punishment for spoiling your dinner is limited in the worldly realm: what, a spanking? Grounding? Even a savage beating is nothing compared to an eternity of torture in hell. Would you damn your child to hell forever because he refused to take a leap of faith? Under such circumstances, I feel that choosing to believe in god is really hedging your bets so you don\u2019t go to a possible hell, which is not really true belief.",

The punishment for eating an apple (popsicle) seems pretty extreme, bible version. Then thousands of years later, the son \u201credeems\u201d everyone by people sacrificing him and hasn\u2019t been seen since. I wouldn\u2019t blame him either. \n\nWhy are there so many denominations all declaring that their truth is the truth? Their interpretation is correct? While I believe the bible has truth, it is primarily metaphorical, and very little should be taken literally. \n\nLet\u2019s try to define a couple things. \nI like - God is all that I don\u2019t know.\nEvil would be the increasing of suffering. Good the decreasing of suffering. \nGood could be measured in a way by being good through time. Is it good today, week, month, etc. And for whom, people, animals, plants etc. By quantity. \n\nIn my observation, God and Satan only exist in people\u2019s minds. And people do terrible things in the name of their God (increasing suffering) and justifying it as fighting evil. There is a very good reason separation of church and state are such a big deal. One mans redeemer is another mans oppressor. Any government with a literal religious overtone are absolutely terrible. But viewed via the definitions above, it is seen as a way to justify evil deeds, while pretending to be good and maintain power. \n\nIn my opinion, religion should help enable one to transcend this existence and reduce suffering. It should not be used to have politics or desire for power transcend your religion. \n\nJust my two cents.",

                              "text": "As a Christian, I absolutely agree. When Jesus was on the Earth, he constantly criticized the Jewish leaders for using their status to oppress and control the lower classes. And then after Jesus left, it didn\u2019t take that long for the Christian churches to start doing the same thing. And so Protestant denominations separated themselves and then started becoming oppressive\u2026 and so on.\n\nObviously the problem isn\u2019t religion. Jesus said a lot of things that a lot of people would probably agree are pretty good. \u201cLove your neighbor\u201d and all that. But some people suck and they\u2019ll take any good thing they can get their hands on and twist it to suit their needs. \n\nAs for Adam and Eve\u2026 I can offer my two cents. I don\u2019t see them being cast out of the garden as a \u201cpunishment.\u201d\n\nTo quote Genesis:\n\u201cBut of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it. For in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.\u201d\n\nIt can sound like \u201cdon\u2019t eat this fruit, or I will kill you.\u201d But I read it as a *warning*: \u201cthis fruit is poison; don\u2019t eat it.\u201d\n\nHe was simply explaining the natural consequence of eating that fruit. It\u2019s like when I tell my son not to eat too many cookies before bed, or he will get a stomachache. I\u2019m not gonna punish him for eating the cookies. But he\u2019s going to eat too many cookies (and so am I, probably) and he\u2019s going to get a stomach ache. That\u2019s just the natural consequence. \n\nSo when Adam and Eve partook of the fruit, God didn\u2019t cast them out of Eden because they were in trouble, it was just the natural consequence of eating the fruit. By eating the fruit, they learned that there are *wrong* and *right* choices. They learned that there can be no good without evil. They were happy in the garden, but they didn\u2019t know it because they had never experienced sadness. They *needed* to leave the garden in order to fully experience life. Regardless of if you think the story is literal or metaphorical, I think that\u2019s a good lesson. Sometimes you just gotta get out and stub your toe.\n\nJesus didn\u2019t come to \u201cfix their mistake\u201d, because it wasn\u2019t a mistake. Adam and Eve are the reason we live in a fallen, imperfect world, yes. But they are also the reason we live *at all*. Jesus came to lift us out of this fallen world at the end of all things. \n\nGod is the kind and loving parent, and we\u2019re just dumb little babies trying to eat rocks. It\u2019ll do no good if he just swats the rocks out of our hands every time. We gotta learn for ourselves that eating rocks is no good.\n\nBut I quite liked what you said. It was well put. I think the world would be a better place if more people thought like you.",

                                  "text": "First thank you for the reply. I woke up today thinking about this.\n\nI need to establish a framework by which to discuss this.\n\n1. Define and identify things.\n2. Establish the things we know with in the context of the story\n3. Decide if things are metaphor or literal\n4. To better establish criteria. Reject additional material if possible. I do think that over aching ideas from other cultures can help reinforce a theme.  So while I see how this can create problems in simplifying dialog. I believe that these themes might be represented in other cultures/religions, and represent a more universal cohesion than differences. Use your judgement. \n\nCharacters - Golem - named Adam occupation gardener. Help meet Eve - Mother of all Living. Jahweh (Lord) God. Maker of Adam. Serpent. Cherebum with Flaming Sword. I am specifically pointing out that LORD is not a King. It is that which holds authority deferred by a King. Therefore is not supreme...\n\nPlace - Eden Garden - implies order and the dominion over nature. Nature could be seen as a place of chaos. 4 rivers.\n\nThis is the second account of creation in the Book of Genesis. We already have a contradiction in order of operation. Man was created on day 6 in the first account and everything else prior. And in the Eden story, there are no plants or man, Yahweh creates man, then creates the garden and puts man in it.  He then creates animals and brings them to be named. Unable to find a suitable helper he puts Adam to sleep and takes a rib and creates the suitable helper Eve. And they were nudists, and they were down with that. The trouble begins when Eve eats the apple from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Yahweh doesn't like their plant based clothes, kills some animals and kicks them out and puts a bouncer with a flaming sword (nothing says don't come back more) and eat from the tree of life, because then for reasons unknown that would be a greater problem. (Breaking my rule here to - spoiler alert - point out for Christians God later sends his son to get killed by these people (put under their feet -buried), only to escape death, and claim eternal life for those that believe. So did he sneak an apple?). It also is in contention with Genesis 1:29 - Then God said, \u201cI give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.\"\n\nTherefore we only have a few options in dealing with a contradiction. One understand that it is a story (metaphor) and reject literal interpretations. Look for the wisdom it is trying to impart and do not get too hung up on the details. Two - take it as literal and shoehorn a narrative to reconcile it - ignoring things that do not fit that narrative. Three - there are actual things that help decode and reconcile this and while elements could be seen as literal, it is still a metaphor. i.e. observation of the heavens - astrology - anthropomorphized into myths.  \n\nThings to point out - The serpent didn't lie. Even Yahweh reiterates this point. They did not die immediately - so was Yahweh really being honest? Would they have died anyway? How is it that God have the knowledge of good and evil, and that is not a problem, but man having this is a problem, The additional actions by Yahweh are punishment. He literally drove them out. Sending people out into the chaos to fend for themselves and a big flaming sword to prevent them from coming back. Saying this is a natural consequence negates the idea of a supernatural God (and one whos mind can be changed), and is in contradiction to his edicts. It also has some parallels with Jesus parable of the two sons, but I think you will find one much more to your liking if you were a character in said story. \n\nMy conclusion - Yahweh is a dick. He seems to be down with nudes and leather though. By the definitions that I provided earlier, increasing suffering and not providing a path to reconciliation/redemption is a bad story. Too bad for Adam and Eve. I reason that this  is primarily metaphor. I have other information that I feel points to this being an astrological myth but I won't bring it up here as it would take time to get to that conclusion, and requires too much other information (outside this specific story). However, Genesis 1 does say that \u201cLet there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years.\"\n\nI do believe that this story might also touch on some hebrew thought of \"mind\". That there is consciousness albeit different represented as Mineral/Plant/Animal/Human. Adam was of the earth(mineral), ate of the fruit(plant), covered themselves in leaves. Yahweh then covers them with Animal skin. Suggesting an evolution of consciousness. \n\nThe serpent (chaos) in the garden (order) reminds me of the ying yang symbol. The dots on each side. From order - Chaos, from Chaos - Order. And this is a great symbol of the primary struggle, Conserve vs Progress as an iteration. \n\nI have to disagree with the idea that it was poison. It is not mentioned to be poison, only that it is fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. I fail to understand how knowledge is poison. The idea is that having the concept of good and evil is what causes us to die. I might logically stretch to believe that the author was trying to get at that is that in being able to perceive our own mortality or comfort we determine our perceptions of good and evil. He just went about it all backwards.\n\nIt is a story of loss of innocence for sure, and a rather brutal grow up story. While I understand the very unforgiving nature of life, it failed to provide an opportunity to provide the best path forward and have the characters find a place of harmony.",

                                      "text": "Sorry I didn't have time to reply until just now. But I've also been thinking about what you wrote here and I wanted to make sure I could make an adequate reply.\n\nAs for the story in Genesis being metaphorical or literal, I am honestly not sure. I think my opinion is that some parts *are* literal, and others are metaphorical. There could have been some actual historical basis for the story, but it eventually got mythicized over thousands of years.\n\nYou point out a few supposed contradictions\u2014the first being the order of the creation. When it says that \"God planted a garden eastward in Eden,\" I don't feel like it's implying that there were no plants on the Earth. I always take it to mean that there *are* plants and animals living all around the Earth, and *then* God prepared a special place called Eden, and filled it with more plants and animals.\n\nThe fact that the creation of Man is mentioned twice is a little strange; I suppose that the creation of Adam in chapter 2 could simply be a \"flashback,\" if you will, to the sixth day.\n\nThe second supposed contradiction you point out is that God says \"every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.\" And yet, He also commands \"of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.\"\n\nThis definitely seems contradictory, but to me, I interpret it as saying \"you may *freely* eat any of the fruit of this garden. You *can* eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, just not *freely.* There are consequences if you eat it: you will be cast out of the Garden, and you will die.\" Eve explains as much to the Serpent in chapter 3.\n\nIn other words, God *did* give *every* tree for food in the Garden of Eden. He just said \"avoid this tree because it will kill you. But like... eat it if you want.\"\n\nAnd, yeah, I've wondered myself for a very long time about why Adam and Eve were not allowed to eat of the Tree of Life after they had been cast out. My interpretation is that by eating of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, they were made unclean and \"unworthy\" to partake of that fruit\u2014thus the need for a Reedemer.\n\nI do like the \"evolution\" that you point out with the creation of Adam. Dust>plants>skin. I don't really have anything to say about that other than it's interesting and I hadn't thought of it that way before.\n\nAnd, no. The Serpent did not lie\u2014not entirely, anyway. He says that if they eat of the fruit that \"your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.\n\nEve realizes that she and Adam are living in innocence and *ignorance.* There are things that she doesn't know that their Father does; if she is to become like her Father, she *must* partake of the fruit of the Tree. So long as they stayed in the Garden, they would have remained in a state of child-like innocence forever, never knowing good nor evil, pleasure nor pain, happiness nor sorrow. \n\nVery much like the Yin and Yang you mentioned. You cannot have the light without the darkness, and vice versa. Partaking of the Fruit is what allowed Adam and Eve's eyes to be opened to both.\n\nAnother contradiction you mention that Man having a knowledge of good and evil is a \"problem,\" but is not a problem for God. I don't think it's a \"problem\" as in it's \"bad,\" but it's a problem for them *so long as they are living in the Garden of Eden.* God says \"you can live in the Garden as long as you want, as long as you don't eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Then you have to leave.\"\n\nAs you say, them being cast out of Eden is symbolic of the loss of childhood innocence. As a child, the world seems amazing and perfect and everything is provided for you. Once you grow up and gain knowledge of how the world works, that innocence goes away. You become accountable for your actions because you *know better.* \n\nAdam and Eve never would have been able to progress along God's plan without leaving the Garden. You also can't progress and become a mature adult without leaving your childhood \"Garden.\"\n\nYes, Adam and Eve fell from a perfect, idyllic garden into a harsh, uncaring wilderness. It meant that they would have to work and suffer. \"In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat bread...\" It might seem harsh and unkind, but it also means that they can *learn.* Sometimes (MOST of the time), growing up sucks. Being an adult STILL sucks. But you it's harder to learn to be a functioning adult if your parents solved every little problem for you and never let you struggle.\n\nI always read the story of Adam and Eve as God creating a learning experience for them. The Garden of Eden was never meant to be a permanent dwelling place. God was essentially asking \"what will they choose? A seemingly perfect life in paradise? Or knowledge, growth, and progression?\"\n\nUltimately, Adam and Eve chose the latter. It wasn't a mistake. It was a conscious decision that they made when they realized \"we are stuck here in this Garden until we eat that Fruit. We can't grow, we can't really *live* until we do.\" \n\nEden could *never* actually be paradise for them because they didn't know anything else.\n\nReally quick, you also mention that Jehovah may not have been entirely honest. I assume that you're talking about the passage that says \"in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.\" Correct me if I am wrong, but you seem to be interpreting the passage as \"if you eat this fruit, you will die in that same day.\" That is definitely one way to interpret the words as they are written. I could also read it \"the day thou eatest thereof, you will become mortal.\" \n\nFunny enough, from the subject of the original meme here, this is definitely a passage where the greater context matters. The word \"day\" here is translated from the Hebrew \"\u05d9\u05d5\u05dd\u200e\" (*yom*), which can be translated in a lot of ways, and definitely causes some confusion throughout the Bible. It can mean a literal \"day,\" or it can mean any arbitrary, unspecified period of time. So, the verse could be saying \"in the **time** thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die.\" In other words, \"If you eat the fruit, you will die *someday.*\"\n\nYou also say that \"increasing suffering and not providing a path to reconciliation/redemption is a bad story,\" and later \"it failed to provide an opportunity to provide the best path forward and have the characters find a place of harmony.\"\n\nTaking this story on its own, it absolutely does seem that \"Yaweh is a dick.\" Adam and Eve fell from their place that was close to God. Having a knowledge of good and evil, they were now capable of sin, which moves them further from God. They have to work, suffer, and ultimately die. \"Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.\" Humanity fell, we live in sin, life sucks. It's very sad.\n\nBut that's ignoring the whole point of the Bible: Jesus Christ. Jesus was raised as the son of human parents, and so he had a knowledge of good and evil. But as the Son of Heavenly Parents, he was able to remain perfect and untouched by sin.  Because He was sinless, only He could be offered to God as a sacrifice\u2014all of humanity had a debt, one which we cannot pay. Thus, we must be damned for eternity, because God is a just God, and allowing a sinful person to walk free would not satisfy justice. \n\nBut Jesus, being perfect, had no debt to pay. He was the only one who really deserved to go to heaven by his own merit. And he used that to pay *our* debt. The demands of justice are satisfied through the suffering and death of Jesus Christ. He took all the suffering and punishment that *we* deserve, so that God can come back to us and exercise *mercy.* He can forgive us our sins because that debt has already been paid through the blood of His Son.\n\nTaking BOTH the stories of Adam and Eve and the story of Jesus together, the big picture of God's plan becomes more clear:\n\nGod created a world for His children to live on. The Fall of Adam and Eve allows the rest of us to exercise our freedom to choose between good and evil. This freedom is vital to our ability to learn and grow while we live on this Earth. Because we are fallen, we are unworthy to re-enter God's presence (partake of the Fruit of the Tree of Life). So, God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to make an Atonement on our behalf. The resurrection of Jesus reverses the final curse of Adam: death itself.\n\nThrough Adam, we fell. Through Jesus Christ, we are redeemed.",

Honestly, I like being challenged sometimes because it forces me to look more critically at my beliefs. \n\nFrom what I have learned about God, He isn\u2019t one to throw people into a lake of fire and brimstone; He isn\u2019t going to torture you because you didn\u2019t \u201cfollow the rules.\u201d I believe it\u2019s more a natural consequence of your actions, based on the natural laws of the universe. You stick your hand in a fire, you will be burned. You jump off the top of a building, you will fall and possibly die. To me, Hell isn\u2019t so much a place as it is a state of being; the mental and emotional anguish that are a result of your wrongdoing (which, again, can eventually be taken away by Christ). \n\nGod isn\u2019t damning anyone to Hell for not believing. It\u2019s *we* that damn ourselves. God\u2019s commandments aren\u2019t so much prison walls as they are guardrails, stopping us from accidentally wandering off a cliff. \n\nAnd you could say \u201cGod is the one that put the cliff there in the first place.\u201d And yeah, I guess so. \n\nYeah, God lets some *really* awful stuff happen. And I\u2019m sure it pains Him to no end, like it would any parent watching their child suffer. \n\nBut if he removed even *some* of the bad, then we wouldn\u2019t *really* be free, would we? Because then He\u2019s making the choice for us. And yeah, that *sucks*.\n\nBut you cannot have *good* without *evil*, nor joy without sorrow, nor pleasure without pain. \n\nIf He took away the bad, it wouldn\u2019t make anything better, because *good* could not exist at all.\n\nUltimately, I choose to follow God because I believe that He loves me. I don\u2019t always know what is going on, but neither does my son. But he still trusts me when I tell him to do something (sometimes) because he knows I love him. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t listen, and then he has to learn from his consequences. That doesn\u2019t change my love for him. \n\nI know that God loves me and so I choose to follow Him simply because of that.",

Gravity is a theory insomuch as we have described the observable phenomenon that the concepts we describe as matter interact with each other in a certain way. There is no observable shred of evidence that god exists, there is nothing I can or have experienced that points to a god. I say I once \u201cbelieved\u201d in god in the same way I once \u201cbelieved\u201d in Santa Claus, which is that, as a child someone told me they exist and I had no reason to question otherwise until I began to think critically about god and santa. And for that matter, I used to receive gifts that were addressed \u201cfrom Santa Claus,\u201d so actually there was some proof (albeit easily disprovable) that santa was a real force that affected my life. \n\nEdit: and I\u2019m not saying I don\u2019t like the concept of god therefore it\u2019s not real. I would love for there to be some cosmic force that promotes good and loves us and all that. I came to the conclusion that if there was a god, I couldn\u2019t have true faith in it because whether or not I believed in god, was ultimately up to god. I don\u2019t want to be the typical Reddit atheist guy but if you\u2019re curious how I came to this conclusion, google \u201cepicurean paradox.\u201d",

The universe cannot work against an omnipotent God who does not wish for it to work against him, that would mean the universe has power beyond that of God . The future cannot differ from the future an omniscient, omnipotent God wishes unless he wishes it to differ so, as he would see the future and have the power to control it to his will throughout time and space. The other option is that God wants things as they are (all the evil  that ever existed) he doesn't have a plan or doesn't care. He could have created a universe of free will with the intent that everyone lives however they are going to live, and shows power merely to show power, and punishes or rewards people by arbitrary rules, knowing people he made to go against him would go against him and not caring. An omniscient, omnipotent and omnipresent God could have done that but it would not be a loving God.",

I went through word by word, sentence by sentence, page by page, chapter by chapter.\n\nAnd I came out an atheist. \n\nThere's just so much of it that doesn't make sense, and I was already sick of being told \"god works in mysterious ways\" or \"some things we're just not meant to know.\"\n\nI saw the contradictions. I saw the obvious evil perpetrated by God. And every time I asked about it, I got the same answers.\n\n\"Mysterious ways.\" \"Past our ability to understand.\" \"Out of context.\" \"...at the time...\"\n\nI came to the conclusion that there was no rationalizing this world being led by an all-powerful being, but that everything makes perfect sense in a natural world with no guiding force (or, at least, no good reason to believe in one.)\n\nI studied the Bible cover to cover, and came out the other side an atheist.",

In much the same way you wouldn't crack open a medical textbook and start performing surgery on yourself because you'd die, you shouldn't crack open a Bible and start parsing the Word of God. \n\nNow cynics and radicals, such as all the protestants and athiests of the world, would say that that is nothing more than dogmatic hogwash propogated by a powerful minority interested in maintaining their power over the masses.",

The term 'Evil' used here is replaced as 'calamity' in other translations, such as the Byington. Considering that God was referring to tangible 'creation' such as light and darkness before, one could assume he was referring to miraculous acts that he performed in earlier scripture. Examples being perhaps the 10 plagues or the splitting of the red sea, which might be 'good' in one perspective, and 'calamity' or 'evil' in another. This interpretation fits the context of Isaiah 45 as a whole, as it seems to be a prophecy regarding an individual named Cyrus, and further in the chapter God talks more about creating the earth and utilizing rain, earth, etc to fulfil his desire.",

Even if calamity might be taking liberty in translation, my interpretation of this verse is that God produced things that are calamitous or 'evil' according to the perception of his enemies. I saw the verses that were used, and they don't disprove my point either, since the argument stems from a definition of evil. From my interpretation, God uses his creation for  good, and for calamity or evil, however not in the sense of something that is morally wrong, but in the sense simply of destruction. I simply fail to see how this could lead to someone saying God therefore 'invented' evil",

It's rather foolish to try and assert that if you don't 'have god', you don't have morality. After all, Genesis claims that humans were made in God's image. If God does not have a human form, then it has to be in regards to our thinking or something similar. While it's true that humans have 'fallen from Grace' as many Christians like to put it, it stands to reason that those qualities may still exist in all humanity. As far as 'Christian' morality, I've met far more decent Athiests than decent Christians. \n\nBut anyways, as far as God and morality, my opinion is this: If God is the creator of everything, then it stands to reason he has the right to decide what is right and wrong",

This is a departure from early Judaism which evolved from Canaanite polytheism. Yahweh was originally the pagan polytheistic God of War. The Semitic version of Ares basically.\n\n\"In the oldest biblical literature he resembles a storm-and-warrior deity[3] who leads the heavenly army against Israel's enemies;[4] at that time the Israelites worshipped him alongside a variety of Canaanite gods and goddesses, including El, Asherah, and Baal,[5] but in later centuries El and Yahweh became conflated and El-linked epithets such as El Shaddai came to be applied to Yahweh alone,[6] and other gods and goddesses such as Baal and Asherah were absorbed into the Yahwistic religion.[7]\"\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh\n\nThis chapter still calls him a God of War with the specific phrase Yahweh Sabaoth aka Yahweh of Armies.\n\n13 I have raised him up in righteousness,\n    and I will make all his ways straight.\nHe shall build my city,\n    and he shall let my exiles go free,\n    not for price nor reward,\u201d says **Yahweh of Armies.**\n\nIt evolved through monolatry(belief in multiple gods but only worshipping one) into monotheism eventually. Along the way he absorbed the other gods/goddess, their powers, and domains like the end of that wiki quote. This is simply a demonstration of that. He's usurped the other gods. He is the only one. He created everything. There is no other.",

We have to spend our life on our knees thanking him? What kind of god would do that? Yes, the world is very splendid, but it also has in it insects whose whole life cycle is to burrow into the eyes of children and make them blind. They eat outwards from the eyes. Why? Why did you do that to us? You could easily have made a creation in which that didn\u2019t exist. It is simply not acceptable.\"",

Theism, in turn, is best understood as a proposition\u2014something that is either true or false. It is often defined as \u201cthe belief that God exists\u201d, but here \u201cbelief\u201d means \u201csomething believed\u201d. It refers to the propositional content of belief, not to the attitude or psychological state of believing. This is why it makes sense to say that theism is true or false and to argue for or against theism. If, however, \u201catheism\u201d is defined in terms of theism and theism is the proposition that God exists and not the psychological condition of believing that there is a God, then it follows that atheism is not the absence of the psychological condition of believing that God exists (more on this below). The \u201ca-\u201d in \u201catheism\u201d must be understood as negation instead of absence, as \u201cnot\u201d instead of \u201cwithout\u201d. Therefore, in philosophy at least, atheism should be construed as the proposition that God does not exist (or, more broadly, the proposition that there are no gods).\n\nThat... That sounds like;\nAtheism is the lack of believe in a God\n\nAs I stated\n\nAm I missing something",

How can dominos fall, if no-one pushed a piece? Secondly, an contiegent thing needs explanation. An infinite set of contiegent things still need explanations. If you see a tree, then you wouldn't assume its just popped into existence, you'd need the explanation of 'well someone probably planted it there'.

Infinity cannot end, and therefore an infinite amount of time wouldn't end. If a sniper had to be ask an advisor for permission to shoot, and the advisor asked their advisor, and the second advisor asked the third, and so on infinitly, then would the sniper ever shoot? No, for the sniper to get approval, he must wait infinitely. For the universe to be created by an infinitly long process, then the universe wouldn't have been created, since the process would need infinite time to complete.

That existence is simply a brute fact. \n\nI also think I should add, because I don't think you caught this, that I'm not advocating for anything, I'm pointing out how you're ruling things in and out without sufficient reason.",

King Jeroboam, its first king, also made two golden calves and said, \"These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\"\n\nThe Quran tells the story of a calf while Moses is gone. A man called \"the Samari\" Yusuf Ali or \"the Samaritan\" (Arberry) is blamed for protagonizing their idolatry.\n\nIn the Quran, Moses' punishment that the Samari cannot be touched is the same as the modern Samaritan's punishment where no Jew was allowed to touch them because of their idolatry. In his commentary, Yusuf Ali claims that the Samari is not a Samaritan.\n\nIt's just that all 3 Abrahamic faiths are filled with literally the same stories in different flavors. All of which are just rip off of older beliefs that Egyptian mythology.\n\nLet me know if you need more info on this, I studied theology; so this is an entertaining topic for me",

This person had its origins with the confederation of northern western Arab tribes\n\nWhile during Muhammad\u2019s time, the tribe was no more, the ruins that the Thamud inhabited around the ancient city of Al-Hijr were a source of Arabic folklore of a once mighty people who had been destroyed by a cataclysmic event (the Qur\u2019an mentions an earthquake) of divine origins.\n\nWhen we come to the laws of Islam, we can clearly see that the Qur\u2019an is quite different from the Bible.\n\nFor example, polygamy - which the New Testament has abolished - is allowed, regulated, and codified in the Qur\u2019an.\n\nUnique to the Qur\u2019an as well was the codification of the ghaziya and how war booty is to be distributed among the mujahedeen\n\nWe cannot discuss Muhammad\u2019s military expeditions without talking about the ancient Arab tribal tradition of the ghaziya\u2014an Arabic word that serves as the origin of the term razzia or raid. In pre-Islamic Arab culture, the ghaziya or ghazwa was a form of limited warfare that avoided head-on confrontations and instead emphasized the taking of livestock, slaves, and property\n\nIn his nine years in Medina, Muhammad sent out 100 military raids and expeditions (Montgomery Watt, Muhammad at Medina, 1956, pp. 339\u2013343). And each of them entailed the distribution of the war-booty. Arguably, Muhammad\u2019s cause rapidly grew because of the promise of war-booty.\n\nWhile the Qur\u2019an doesn\u2019t regulate daily prayers to minute detail, one has to look at the rituals surrounding the Ka\u2019aba. The Hajj has been practiced as it is today even before Islam. It is not something new that Islam has invented. The only difference is that instead of 360 deities, presided over by Hubal, the owner and chief deity of the Ka\u2019aba, Muslims now pray to Allah, the owner of the Ka\u2019aba.\n\nAlthough the theology behind angels and the divine in Islam and the Bible is quite different, the Qur\u2019an also features a unique race of supernatural beings that cannot be found anywhere else except Arabic folklore. I am talking about the Jinn.\n\nThe Qur\u2019an even goes so far to dedicate a whole Surah to these incorporeal beings. Aptly named Surah Al-Jinn\nThe Jinn are described quite similar to the Celtic Faeries: a race of beings who live side-by-side with humans in their own tribes and families but are rarely to be seen by humans. The Jinn can shapeshift into various animals (dogs and snakes - one of the reasons why the Hadith calls for these animals\u2019 extermination), eat dung, and can provide humans with supernatural knowledge.\n\nThe ancient Arabs had their own shamans or mediums who are supposed to be able to contact these beings. According to Jordanian scholar, Dr. Rafat Amari in his book Occultism in the Family of Muhammad, Khadijah\u2019s first husband was Nabash ibn Zarareh ibn Wakdan. Ibn Wakdan was a visionary for the Jinn. Dr. Amari wrote that this profession was the source of Khadijah\u2019s wealth.\n\nIt is also quite interesting to see how the Qur\u2019an diminishes the role of the Christian devil. In the Qur\u2019an, Satan or Iblis is described not as a fallen angel, but rather as an obstinate Jinn who dared to defy Allah\u2019s command\n\nBased on all the points above, we can clearly say that Muhammad clearly added Arabic folklore and beliefs into his new religion. It seems that the Qur\u2019an itself is a composite of Jewish and Christian stories and folklore added in with a sizeable dose of Arab superstitions, beliefs, and myths.\n\nAs far as how he got his hands on the folklore is not even a topic for discussion.\n\nThe topics for discussion are\n- what points and stories are accurate\n-is there evidence of events in the texts\n-can you provide substance to your beliefs.\n\nI guess I've just never been confronted with the idea that THAT is what someone is focused on.",

It just means God likes to repeat his stories. As for evidence, absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence : unless you expect that evidence to be present. Regardless of that, if you visit Haql, KSA, there are a bunch of monuments that allegedly are where Moses did certain events. There is a underwater passage from Egypt to KSA ending with a split mountain on KSA, which could be from where Moses split the sea. Mount Siniah could very well be Jabl al-Lowez. There are wells in the area which people think belonged to Moses's tribe. This evidence is by no mean conclusive, but since you asked for some there you go. But even with all the evidence of the world, that wouldn't make you Muslim right? You'd just assume some natural explanation made these monuments, and the folk imagined stories about them. So again, what's your point, how do the similarities between the faiths disprove any of them? Moreover, if the prophet wasn't a prophet, then who wrote the Quran? Him?

It's the type of fallacy that makes religion such a joke.\n\nYou have the pre-disposition that the only valid explanations are natural explanations. In order to accept any evidence for or against Islam, you must first believe in a God. Regardless of this, I added that tiny tidbit of evidence because I couldn't help myself. So since I already did provide this evidence, I'll just go along with it anyway. I challenge you to explain how he did it. Yes we believe it is impossible for it to happen any other way. What's another possibility?  \n\n\nAs for Egyptian mythology, we believe there are thousands of prophets. There could have easily been a prophet in ancient Egypt, who taught them things, and then pharaohs twisted the story through time to suit their narrative. We believe all prophets told the same message. I also don't believe the bible is a reliable piece of information. If you 'studied' theology as you claim you did, then you would know how there is literally no reason to believe what's in the bible. All of the gospels are written by anonymous writers, making them have exactly 0 credibilities, so why do you hold me to that standard? From our world-view, all differences from the bibles, are corrections. Whatever inspiration from Egyptian mythology in the Torah, doesn't apply to Muslims. Whatever resemblance from Egyptian mythology which is in the Quran can be just explained by the fact there were likely prophets in ancient Egypt or even before then that spread correct information, which had its whispers preserved.",

I have no doubt, that if religion wasnt forced upon you from the day you are born, it would be perceived as nothing but fictional stories up for personal interpretation (which is *all* it is) within decades.\n\nBut that will probably never be possible. The hooks of this manmade instrument to keep a certain part of the population in power is the greatest that's ever been and ever will be. It's fucking scary and downright evil.",

The Hebrew word can refer to moral evil, and often does have this meaning in the Hebrew Scriptures. However, due to the diversity of possible definitions, it is unwise to assume that \u201cI create evil\u201d in Isaiah 45:7 refers to God bringing moral evil into existence.\n\n> (2) The context of Isaiah 45:7 makes it clear that something other than \u201cbringing moral evil into existence\u201d is in mind. The context of Isaiah 45:7 is God rewarding Israel for obedience and punishing Israel for disobedience. God pours out salvation and blessings on those whom He favors. God brings judgment on those who continue to rebel against Him. \u201cWoe to him who quarrels with his Master\u201d (Isaiah 45:9). That is the person to whom God brings \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cdisaster.\u201d So, rather than saying that God created \u201cmoral evil,\u201d Isaiah 45:7 is presenting a common theme of Scripture \u2013 that God brings disaster on those who continue in hard-hearted rebellion against Him.",

Indeed, it's basically heresy. The early Christian cult needed to invent the concept of Hell because it was how they gave meaning to their cult leader / prophet's execution by the state -- i.e. Jesus died to save us all from Hell.\n\nWhat is supported in scripture is the Talmudic analog for Satan -- Samael. A powerful, loyal Archangel in full service to God, tasked by the latter with doing 'evil' in service to a greater good. Samael deceives, seduces, and destroys, and it's all by God's direction.",

There are often more gray areas in politics than there are black and white, and even more opinions on those subjects.\n\nIt is commonly accepted that churches should not directly politicize their services. Yes, some do it. However, it is generally a bad idea. Most churches choose to instead teach from principles of Biblical truth. The ones directly endorsing candidates do so at great risk to their own credibility.\n\n>Those that do not cover up crimes in their organisation. \n\nV agree.\n\n>Those that do not partake in \"prosperity preaching\".\n\nAlso, agree. The prosperity gospel is heresy. Its teaching places value on possessions over people.\n\n>Those that do not shun their members for transgressions.\n\nThe Bible is clear on sin in the church. (1 Corinthians 5:1-5) Unrepentant, willful sinning members of the body are to be cast out. Confessing, repentant members are not. I have personally experienced both of these in my life, and I'm thankful for those lessons.\n\n>Those that do not preach active hate... \n\nThe message of Christ has no part in these things. The wbc is heretical christian cult. \n\n>Those that do not teach bible literalism\n\nBible scholars know that much of the Bible is written as a figurative work. Teaching the whole thing is 100% literal is incorrect.",

The Bible says unrepentant sinning members of the church are to be cast out. So how does that work is that exactly? Unrepentant means a person, in this case a Christian, who refuses to quit willfully sinning. Other members of the church should confront them, and if they refuse to work towards ending the sin issue then that person is required to leave the church. Why? Because unrepentant sin corrupts the whole church.\n\nNote that a person cast out from the fellowship of the church isn't damned, or excommunicated as the catholic church might do. They're welcomed back in after the sin is confessed and they repent. Repentance just means to turn away from sin. It doesn't mean they're perfect, or sinless. It just means they are actively working against the sin behavior.\n\nThis is all modeled in scripture.

No need to actually help people, I'll just pray and pretend that my prayer is out there helping people through Jesus.\n\nThis is not what I'm saying at all. This is not actually a living, breathing kind of faith that you're describing. Real faith in Jesus will motivate a believer to do the works to bless others. The works do not save you, but they come from the faith that does. This scripture says it better than I ever could. \n\nWhat good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but don\u2019t show it by your actions? Can that kind of faith save anyone? Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing, and you say, \u201cGood-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well\u201d\u2014but then you don\u2019t give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do? So you see, faith by itself isn\u2019t enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless. Now someone may argue, \u201cSome people have faith; others have good deeds.\u201d But I say, \u201cHow can you show me your faith if you don\u2019t have good deeds? I will show you my faith by my good deeds.\u201d You say you have faith, for you believe that there is one God. Good for you! Even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. How foolish! Can\u2019t you see that faith without good deeds is useless?\r\nJames 2:14\u202d-\u202c20 NLT",

Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God. But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!\r\nGalatians 5:19\u202d-\u202c23 NLT\n\nIt is true that terrible things have been done in the past by people who declared themselves as Christians. It is also true that God can save anyone with faith in Jesus. It is for this reason that we cannot be certain of the salvation of another person from ourselves. I can only believe for myself, and I can only judge for myself if my faith is marked by the fruits of the Spirit of God.\n\nThis is not to say that believers should not hold each other accountable. If someone proclaims the Name of Jesus it is on the believers in their community around them to hold them accountable to their actions even while being unsure on the destination of the other person's soul.

If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector.\n\nMatthew 7:1-5 ESV \n\u201cJudge not, that you be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, \u2018Let me take the speck out of your eye,\u2019 when there is the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.\n\nChristians are commanded to judge members of their own body. The last passage here is quite well known because we inherently like telling others their hypocrisy. However, look at the last command from verse 5, \"first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.\" Jesus is sayingwe must first deal with the sin in ourselves before judgment is placed on our neighbors.

There is scriptural evidence of this fact. \n\nAnd as for your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.\r\nDeuteronomy 1:39 ESV\n\nFor before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted.\r\nIsaiah 7:16 ESV\n\nUntil this point is reached God does not hold them accountable if they die. How do we know this? One scriptural evidence is this. King David committed adultery with Bathsheba, and their baby became very sick. David prayed and fasted for the boy, refusing to eat. Then his child died. \n\nBut when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David understood that the child was dead. And David said to his servants, \u201cIs the child dead?\u201d They said, \u201cHe is dead.\u201d Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes. And he went into the house of the Lord and worshiped. He then went to his own house. And when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate. Then his servants said to him, \u201cWhat is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food.\u201d He said, \u201cWhile the child was still alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, \u2018Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?\u2019 But now he is dead. Why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me.\u201d\r\n2 Samuel 12:19\u202d-\u202c23 ESV\n\nDavid knew that he would see his child again in God's kingdom.",

Even if that god did exist, you would rather live a pathetic, boring life here, and then spend eternity being nothing but a husk that does nothing but praise your idiotic god that sends trillions to suffer for eternity for the crime of not sucking his cock. Your god is built upon being an infinitely loving, infinitely good being, but he builds up a life full of suffering, to either have us suffer, or be mindless worship robots. I hope you find your way out of this disgusting religion soon, although seeing the cognitive dissonance presented here, I'm not sure if you will.",

In the Old Testament he is The Accuser, the angle of God whose job it is to inform God of crimes committed by humans so they can be judged. He is subservient to God and acts only with God's explicit order.\n\nYou are right that the concept of Satan in the New Testament is based on Persian influences, specifically Zoroastrianism. In Zoroastrianism there are two gods a good one and an evil one. The idea of Satan being an enemy of God was incorporated into Jewish folklore from Zoroastrianism in the last few hundred years before Jesus was born. It never made it into Jewish Canon, but it did influence Christianity and Islam and made it into canon there.",

Have You not made a fence around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But reach out with Your hand now and touch all that he has; he will certainly curse You to Your face.\u201d Then the Lord said to Satan, \u201cBehold, all that he has is in your power; only do not reach out and put your hand on him.\u201d So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord.\n\nSo he proposes a specific test of Job, and God tells him to carry out that specific test, but nothing more. This happens again with his health.\n\nSatan is also shown as subservient in Zechariah 3:1-2\n\n> Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right to accuse him. And the LORD said unto Satan: 'The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan, yea, the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee; is not this man a brand plucked out of the fire?'\n\nFurther, in 1 Chronicles 21:1, God has Satan relay his orders to David:\n\n> Then Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to count Israel.\n\n...and God got very angry when those orders weren't carried out correctly (1 Chronicles 21:7)\n\n> Now God was displeased with this thing, so He struck Israel. \n\nAt no point in the Old Testament does Satan *ever* oppose God, work against God, or do anything other than what God tells him to.\n\nAnd of course Satan is mentioned specifically in Job, since he is the only \"Son of God\" that actually has a role in the story.",

Despite the traditional ascriptions, all four are anonymous and most scholars agree that none were written by eyewitnesses.\n\n\nThere were some books, such as the Gospels, that had been written anonymously, only later to be ascribed to certain authors who probably did not write them (apostles and friends of the apostles).

Very few people think you can just read the bible and be good, so at best you've proven some denominations who are creationist and take every word literally without need for interpretation wrong. That's not a majority\n\nThey literally built years and years of theology on discussing this stuff. Everywhere that some 16yo redditor finds a hole you can bet most church dont actually believe it verbatim. You all really think you *figured it out* but are out here showing clearly you haven't read the bible. \n\n> god gave us that free will\n\nYou didnt make it through the first book? I'm not Christian by any means. I just think this circle jerk of \"we redditors cracked the code\" is so pathetic. So few churches are *just the book* each one will have it's own interpretations. So your ideas dont apply. So you can stick to \"you use religion to justify bad things\", \"theres no proof\", \"it seems too vague\" which are all reasonable responses.

      "text": "\"Isaiah 45:7 in the King James Version reads, \u201cI form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.\u201d How does Isaiah 45:7 agree with the view that God did not create evil? There are two key facts that need to be considered. (1) The word translated \u201cevil\u201d is from a Hebrew word that means \u201cadversity, affliction, calamity, distress, misery.\u201d Notice how the other major English Bible translations render the word: \u201cdisaster\u201d (NIV, HCSB), \u201ccalamity\u201d (NKJV, NAS, ESV), and \u201cwoe\u201d (NRSV). The Hebrew word can refer to moral evil, and often does have this meaning in the Hebrew Scriptures. However, due to the diversity of possible definitions, it is unwise to assume that \u201cI create evil\u201d in Isaiah 45:7 refers to God bringing moral evil into existence.\n\n(2) The context of Isaiah 45:7 makes it clear that something other than \u201cbringing moral evil into existence\u201d is in mind. The context of Isaiah 45:7 is God rewarding Israel for obedience and punishing Israel for disobedience. God pours out salvation and blessings on those whom He favors. God brings judgment on those who continue to rebel against Him. \u201cWoe to him who quarrels with his Master\u201d (Isaiah 45:9). That is the person to whom God brings \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cdisaster.\u201d So, rather than saying that God created \u201cmoral evil,\u201d Isaiah 45:7 is presenting a common theme of Scripture \u2013 that God brings disaster on those who continue in hard-hearted rebellion against Him.\"\n\nTLDR, yes it was taken out of context.",

I might think my child would disobay me or do wrong. There is a vast expanse between thinking and knowing on a human level, and knowing as an all powerful god. However, to help the example along, if I were engaged in the procreation of a child, and the technology was as such to detect a certain disability doomed to agony and sorrow, NO...I would not procreate.

Put simply, because it was the christian god who committed the Original Sin. The characters of Adam and Eve are more like the first scientists, attempting to determine the truth about their world.\n\nAllow me to retell the story absent christian propaganda:\n\n> After the serpent told Eve a different thing than god, *even before she ate of the fruit, she had knowledge of good and evil*. She knew that one of the two beings had told a lie. She didn't yet know which had lied, but she knew that at least one of them was lying since their statements were mutually exclusive.\n\n> At that point Eve could choose to ignore her new knowledge and live in ignorance, or she could choose to pursue the truth and determine which being had lied to her. If she were alone, that choice could have been made freely.\n\n> But god had created Eve with deep love for Adam.\n\n> Because of this deep love, Eve made her choice for Adam's benefit. If god was telling the truth, then to eat of the fruit was to condemn herself. Yet if god was lying, to fail to eat of the fruit was to condemn Adam to live with a liar, and not just a liar, but a liar who controlled every aspect of their lives. That's a mortal threat. \n\n> And thus, out of her love for Adam, Eve ate of the fruit, willingly sacrificing herself for the good of Adam, that he may know whether or not his god was lying to him.\n\n> After conducting her experiment, Eve did not die. At that moment she knew that her god had lied to her and the serpent spoke the truth.\n\n> She shared this knowledge with Adam and they repeated the experiment, the results confirming that their god had lied to them.\n\n> They hid from their god. Why would they do this when god had already told them that he is all knowing, that he sees everything? Simple. They were no longer able to trust any of his claims. Although their actions were futile, they show the deep betrayal of trust engendered by their god's lie.\n\n> Yet to lie is to sin. And thus, the Original Sin was committed by god, not by man.\n\n:-P",

That forced creation into disfunction, and at the same time sin was passed down through the lineage of mankind. God chose to create us with free will, so He does allow this to happen. \n\nSo you have two things going on. One being that people make conscious mistakes (sin), and pay the price. The other that the natural world is already in disfunction because mankind broke it, and innocent children pay for those mistakes (sins) too even before they consciously sin for themselves. This is because all mankind is born into sin.",

Again, if sin is passed down by our ancestors (which is out of out control) it is unjust to punish us for something out of our control. I am also not disrespecting religion, i am simply criticizing religion, and that is not an insult.

I think morality is somewhat subjective, but that does not apply when talking about the bible and the Christian god.\n\nJust because a perspective is limited does not mean that it can not be right, saying otherwise is just simply a dismissal of a point you don't like, especially because you cannot prove that the bigger picture proves me wrong regardless. Also, why would god not try to justify himself so he doesn't look like a moral monster? It would certainly bring people to the faith, as well as keep people in it too.

He could have made us perfect, yet he chose to make us flawed. This implies that God is cruel and is willingly putting his favored creation through trials, knowing some of them will be tortured for an eternity when they fail. \n\nYou also state that God cannot have any part of sin, and yet in a universe where he is the absolute master of all, he MUST have allowed for sin to be. Since he created all, doesn't that mean that he created sin as well? I'm genuinely curious what your thoughts are on this. \n\nAlso, thank you for sticking through and answering, even though some people here mock and downvote you. I respect your opinion.",

He could have made us perfect, yet he chose to make us flawed.\n\nThe word perfect is being asked to do a lot of work here, but perhaps it is better to say it this way. God made creation as a representation of His glory. He made man and creation without sin. He gave us free will, and we chose to turn from God by sinning. That brought the curse of sin into the world, which is why even human babies and children who haven't sinned yet experience things like sickness and other disasters.\n\nThe fact that God knew what would happen doesn't relinquish our responsibility from making our own decisions. I don't have a gotcha answer for the question of God's joint responsibility for original sin since He gave us free will. Many hundreds of years of theological thought have centered on this question. I do know that God continued to love mankind after the fall. I do know that He went out of His way to endure the offense of sin against Him. I do know that He payed for all of it Himself. I do not believe that God is this loving and actively chose to create people only to damn them.\n\nAlso for question two...Allowing sin to go on isn't God taking part in it. This is actually evidence for God's longsuffering quality. God in His just nature would have destroyed us, but in His love chose endure the offense of sin in order that some might be saved.",

You want to make it complicated because you can't accept what it actually means. That your god is evil.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> you have a horrible problem of evil\n\nNot really no. The problem of evil comes from having an all-knowing all powerful supposedly benevolent guy not stoping what he himself considers evil. Ever heard of epicurus ? No one that does not believe in a god has any problem with why evil exists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> I'm sympathetic.\n\nI'll bet that you think you are. but then again, why don't you ask your own god to deal with that problem instead ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> If the God of the Bible doesn't exist, then you are left with a truly   \ndevastating puzzle--something awful is decimating the world.\n\nYour inability to accept the world as it is isn't an argument for your god.

It can mean *evil* too, but only in a loose sense. The Hebrew word for literal evil is *roa* according to [Strong\u2019s](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7455.htm). The verse is essentially saying that God brings happiness / prosperity, but he can also bring misery / destruction, implying rewards for the good and punishment for the wicked.\n\nIn classical theism, God does not create evil, but neither does Satan. Evil rather is simply the privation or lack of goodness, much like cold doesn\u2019t have literal existence but is just the relative lack of heat.",

So what you are reading in Genesis 1:1 is God creating the Heavens and the Earth *out of the primordial ocean*.\n\nHere is the part you are talking about from the New American Standard Version, which from what I can find is supposed to be the best English Bible right now. It is Genesis 1:1\n\n> In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\n\nBut they explain this starting in Genesis 1:2. \n\n> And the earth was a formless and desolate emptiness, and darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.\n\nSo in the beginning there was only \"the deep\"/\"the waters\", the primordial chaotic ocean that everything started from. Again, this primordial chaos isn't unique to Judaism, it is a common element of creation myths.\n\nThen we have Genesis 1:6-8:\n\n> Then God said, \u201cLet there be [e]an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.\u201d God made the expanse, and separated the waters that were below the expanse from the waters that were above the [h]expanse; and it was so. God called the expanse \u201cheaven.\u201d And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.\n\nSo God creates an empty area of air in the waters, and calls this \"heaven\". This is the part about creating heaven you mentioned in Genesis 1:1.\n\nThen we have Genesis 1:9-10\n\n> Then God said, \u201cLet the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear\u201d; and it was so. And God called the dry land \u201cearth,\u201d and the gathering of the waters He called \u201cseas\u201d; and God saw that it was good. \n\nSo here God separates the waters again, and produces dry land, the \"Earth\". This is the part about creating the Earth you mentioned in Genesis 1:1.\n\nIn the Biblical story, the original primordial ocean still exists, both above the firmament (a solid dome that holds back the waters above and in which the stars are embedded) and below the land. God can release both waters at any time, and in fact does so during Noah's flood by opening doors in the firmament and land to let the waters below come in.",

      "text": "[Here's one interpretation](https://www.gotquestions.org/Isaiah-45-7.html)\n\nBut as usual, it leaves the question of where did evil come from, if not from God, unanswered.  Because it also says the word translated is ambiguous, it also calls into question what the writer was getting at, and if we can trust the translated version(s) of scriptures.\n\n\"Isaiah 45:7 in the King James Version reads, \u201cI form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.\u201d How does Isaiah 45:7 agree with the view that God did not create evil? There are two key facts that need to be considered. (1) The word translated \u201cevil\u201d is from a Hebrew word that means \u201cadversity, affliction, calamity, distress, misery.\u201d Notice how the other major English Bible translations render the word: \u201cdisaster\u201d (NIV, HCSB), \u201ccalamity\u201d (NKJV, NAS, ESV), and \u201cwoe\u201d (NRSV). The Hebrew word can refer to moral evil, and often does have this meaning in the Hebrew Scriptures. However, due to the diversity of possible definitions, it is unwise to assume that \u201cI create evil\u201d in Isaiah 45:7 refers to God bringing moral evil into existence.\n\n(2) The context of Isaiah 45:7 makes it clear that something other than \u201cbringing moral evil into existence\u201d is in mind. The context of Isaiah 45:7 is God rewarding Israel for obedience and punishing Israel for disobedience. God pours out salvation and blessings on those whom He favors. God brings judgment on those who continue to rebel against Him. \u201cWoe to him who quarrels with his Master\u201d (Isaiah 45:9). That is the person to whom God brings \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cdisaster.\u201d So, rather than saying that God created \u201cmoral evil,\u201d Isaiah 45:7 is presenting a common theme of Scripture \u2013 that God brings disaster on those who continue in hard-hearted rebellion against Him.\"",

Evil exist because of a choice made by one angel. \n\nHeaven was filled with countless angels and they all have free will. It could be said that there was probably a social system in heaven among the angels themselves and how they carried out gods will. They all, with free will, were choosing to love and obey him. However, one of them, saw how much god was being loved and obey and started to think to himself, \u201chey, I want to be loved and obeyed like god is.\u201d This thought tried to envy and then into hatred. He kept feeding this thought until he not only wanted the love god was receiving but wanted the other angels to stop loving him. That\u2019s when evil was \u201cborn\u201d.  God didn\u2019t create evil. Satan started to want something that did not belong to him and cultivated thoughts and intentions and went against god himself.\n\nSo back to the hypothetical about raising kids. So you\u2019re saying that you shouldn\u2019t be blamed for your kids actions and intentions even if you raised them good? I know you aren\u2019t to blame but don\u2019t blame social systems because you didn\u2019t create them. If you raised your kids to be good and to love then they wouldn\u2019t turn evil unless they willing choose to be. \n\nEvil is not necessary at all. There\u2019s no debate about that.

The conversation was about who created evil, God or Satan. Red stated that the very clear Bible quote the Blue gave stating God created evil was out of context. So I was saying that even if that quote was not present, the creator of evil itself goes back to God regardless, here. That was all that I was saying. \n\nMy argument is that if there is free will, then there are options to choose from. Because if there was only ever one choice, that isn't free will. I was saying that God either explicitly created evil OR God implicitly created evil by creating the only circumstances under which it could occur (by creating the capability to not be good). \n\nNowhere did I say in my reply that I should be blameless for how my hypothetical children become. I said that there are more factors that go into how my children become how they are than what I can control. \n\nThe difference between God and myself is that God has the ability to choose if His creations have the choice to choose Him. I do not physically have the power to do that. I cannot make my hypothetical children be exactly how I want them to be. I can try my best to influence them to be good people, but I literally do not have the abilities of time, space or reality, to actually enforce that if my best is not enough. God does. \n\nSo it seems that the real question is if God is as all-powerful as I have been told to be able to vanquish evil and simply chooses not to, or if He is not actually powerful enough to stop it, thus not being ALL-powerful.",

Most agnostics keep reasoning that if god exist then everything bad is his fault cause he\u2019s god. God isn\u2019t responsible for a persons choices. Again, sorry for bringing up free will again, but a reason we have free will is for people to understand than choices have consequences. Now, not all choice are \u201cgood or evil\u201d, or only restricted between two options. \n\nAnd, I think I mentioned it already but the reason god hasn\u2019t \u201cvanquished evil\u201d is to show how wrong satan was for choosing it.

It just seems to me that His goal seems to be that we choose our path, but to do that, God, in this framework made there be options in the first place. \n\nAll I've been trying to say this whole time is if God made good, He made evil as well. There's nothing wrong with both being made by Him. Honestly, it fits the narrative of choice better if He made both rather than evil being some offshoot that was never intended. That part doesn't make sense to me. Why would He have allowed it to be created in the first place if it wasn't intended for us to choose between.\n\nI do know that not every choice is between good and evil, but I will also say that there isn't good and neutral if neutral didn't have aspects of evil in it. How can we understand what good is if evil doesn't exist? That, honestly, would makes sense as to why he would have created evil. That would make sense. If God wants us to choose to be good, but not have evil, how would we know what good even is in the first place? \n\nOf course I don't want evil, but that's because I already know evil exists. That is why I choose good. Because I don't want evil. \n\nAs far as my personal agnostic viewpoint, I truly believe that we, as humans, can only perceive the universe to a certain degree as limited to our senses and imagination. As such, our understanding of the how's and why's of everything is similarly limited. I don't think it's possible to truly know for a fact how or why things came to be. And I'm okay with that. I do think belief systems are necessary because they help us find purpose in life. We just need to choose which one makes the most sense to us, while understanding that maybe it isn't the TRUE answer. Just my answer. And everyone is entitled to their own answer. \n\nI mean all this to say is that I did not enter into the debate with any intention of ill will. I think it's healthy to look at various viewpoints once in a while. Does it change minds? Rarely ever. But convincing someone of something isn't the point. It's just to explore other options so I don't close myself off to things.\n\nFor this conversation, my initial comment truly was to look at how Red's logic does not match up to the parameters from what I understood. Whether I have been successful in that remains to be seen. \n\nEither way, this has been fun, but I do need to go to bed since it's getting late and I have work tomorrow. Night!",

Because then it is VERY easy to put the things you don't like into the Satan pile and it becomes very easy to hate and feel justified for it. It makes it easy to not think of the larger nuance of the situation.\n\nIf you instead believe that a single being created all things, good and evil OR multiple beings that created many things, but crucially still neutral, it is much harder to scapegoat so definitively because there is much more nuance.\n\nDoes that mean every person who views God and Satan in this way are bad for doing so? Of course not. It is just very easy to get into a line if thinking that can get dangerous as soon as a group of people are defined as being in Satan's camp. Because suddenly this group is fully devoid of God's \"goodness\" and are therefore inherently evil. \n\nIt is much easier to see that everyone has both good and evil inside of them when there is a truly neutral higher being rather than a binary set that is purely one or the other.",

But there used to be two kinds (and different words for each type, in some cases). \n\nOne type of evil is the evil of sin; sentient evil, if you will. This evil requires conscious avoidance of virtue in favor of vice.\n\nThe other type is the evil of circumstance. If you read ancient literature, you may have read sentences along the lines of, \"The volcano's eruption resulted in an *evil* day for Pompeii.\" Today, we might call such an event a *disaster* or a *catastrophe*; destruction of a created thing is, in this sense of the word, an evil perpetrated on creation itself. \n\nThe original word used in the passage mentioned here carried with it the latter meaning, not the former.\n\nDespite his incredibly weak \"I went to church, so I know shit\" attitude, he's correct, in a theological light. What he's missing (and what would help his case immensely) is that according to *actual* Catholic theology (and most other Christian branches), the question isn't so much one of God being incapable of evil as it is one of God literally *being* any and all things good. The Platonic *Good*, so to speak.\n\nIf something is objectively good, it is of God because God is literally defined as anything and everything good and true in the universe.\n\nTo say that God can *cause* evil is essentially the same as saying that compassion literally *causes* hate. You could argue that some people *react to* compassion with hate, but compassion itself didn't *cause* the hate; the hate didn't spring forth *out of* compassion. The source of hate is an antithesis of compassion.\n\nHope this helps some of you. Too busy to join a debate, though... I have to go work for an actual evil boss. My apologies.",

But in order for us to CHOOSE, we must have the freedom to do so. This can only be possible if evil n good exist.\n\nThis is easily explained by looking at parents n children and life experiences. A parent could simply just refuse a child to eat( because they are afraid they could choke while eating), refuse that the child learns to drive( fear of accidents-), refuse that a child engage in different activities ( Because they are afraid something bad would happen to the child).\n\n If the parent did this, we would say the parent is abusing the child, surely. But because the parent loves the child so much, the parent  lets the child eat, drive, etc... Even if there is a risk involved. The parent just does their very best to teach the kid how to avoid those risks. Now the child can choose what activities to engage in freely.  Free will.\n\nYou can't have free will in a restrictive world. Even by our human standards, we call that abuse. So evil had to exist to allow humans to choose.",

No, that's not a valid source, so your assertion is only your opinion and not fact.\n\nThen, you accuse me of \"a serious lacking in vocabulary (sic).\" The word \"lacking\" is an adjective, which you use as a noun, and the conjunction is mismatched (\"in\" should be \"of\"). I need help with vocabulary, and you need help with grammar.\n\n\"Evil\" and \"calamity\" are not synonyms, but have overlapping meanings. They're two different words, with different meanings, otherwise one or the other wouldn't exist and we wouldn't be having this conversation.\n\nTo your addendum, people usually want no further examination of their arguments when they bring up irrelevant points...it's a sign that they didn't fully think their point through. I didn't mention archeology, but you can go down that rabbit trail if you feel the need to avoid further self-examination.\n\nFinally...you misused the word \"pander,\" and misspelled \"Turin,\" a city in Italy.\n\nThank you for helping me make my point...\"evil\" refers to generic events or people with negative impact to events/people that may or may not have definite causation, and \"calamity\" refers to a specific causal event that has catastrophic results or consequences.",

Evil was created when knowledge of what is good was obtained.  Regardless of one's belief, the story of Adam and Eve is well known.  They lived without sin in the garden until the ate of the tree of the <keyword> Knowledge of Good and Evil.  At that point, their eyes were opened to what was good and what was evil.  Before that, the only law was to not eat of that tree.  Stepping forward, the law was handed to Moses which is what the orthodox Jewish people have governed by since.  This is when the formal sin was defined.  Without the law, there was no definition of sin. \n\nThe same applies today.  Laws made today don't serve to reduce crime, they instead define crime.  By defining crime, you obtain a means by which to judge that crime.\n\nTo sum this up, God did create evil as a side-effect of creating good.",

If they bothered to look at other versions or the original text, the meaning becomes clearer. \n\nThis was translated from Hebrew and the word is closely associated with disaster/calamity/natural disasters/adversity/etc., which is talking about having the power to make peace and having the power to do the opposite in context (of which was shown many times by this point). If you bothered to check the chapter, the context makes it even clearer. Evil is used as a synonym in older English to these events (which is why the older versions of these translations often use it as the meaning was common in those days) so the language has changed nowadays as it often does. This isn't the only example of this in these versions, either. \n\nI won't bother to get into the debate but if the blue person is trying to use this as evidence for their points, it isn't going to be sufficient. I don't get why others are so quick to jump on this but they are likely biased and couldn't care less about the accuracy, judging from the comments on here.

If 'evil' is morally corrupt and destructive behaviour then totally God can't create that. 1 He likes free will so he forces no one to do evil, every person is responsible for their own actions. 2. God can't be definition do anything morally corrupt. God is our example for what is good and whatever he does has to be good. Ergo only free beings can 'create' evil including Satan and ourselves.\n\nThe verse quoted uses another definition of 'evil' meaning 'unpleasant things' the Bible translation I looked up said 'calamity' instead. Nothing about morality there. If however the conversation was about whether God only does pleasant things, then blue is totally correct and red is naive. You don't have to look very far in the Bible before God does all sorts of unpleasantness.",
