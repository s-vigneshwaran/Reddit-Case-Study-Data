  "text": "TIFU by eating ramen before inviting a guy over\nI have a pretty high spice tolerance and frequently eat the Korean fire noodles, sometimes with extra Korean chili flakes added to make it super spicy. I had a bowl today, before inviting a guy I've been casually seeing.\n\nHe comes over and we get all excited. He loves oral, so I start sucking, and he's moaning, so I'm thinking he's into it, right? Well, his moaning gets louder and he starts pushing on my head, so I assume that means keep going, and go harder. So I do that.\n\nFinally, he yells \"FUCK!\" And pushes me away. He starts screaming at me that his dick is burning and what the fuck did I do to it? I was really confused, while he went to the bathroom to go see what was going on. And my eyes see the opened ramen pack in the kitchen trash bin, and I realize the spice/pepper must've still been in my mouth and probably burned him.\n\nHe comes out cursing, asking me what the fuck was wrong with me. I apologized and explained I didn't realize my eating ramen could hurt him. He left, and I'm a little disappointed. But also now I'm hungry again and eating another bowl of Korean fire noodles with extra chili flakes\n\nTL;DR: burned a guy's dick after eating Korean fire noodles\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the wholesome awards LOL\n\nEdit: stop sending me DM's saying you're into this or saying you're sad we don't live close to each other. I probs wouldn't be into you even if we lived next door",

I wanted to see how long it would take dawn dish soap to remove the pain on my genitals after application.\n\n2. I wanted to see it dawn dish soap would help if your mouth was on fire.\n\n\nTo assist I had an order of blazin wings ordered extra saucy to help assist me. To reenact the 1st my wife agreed to eat blazing wings and give a blowjob.\n\nAfter eating two wings  She said her mouth was on fire. To ensure some coverage she then put a little bit of sauce from the bottom of the Togo container in her mouth and proceeded to give me a blowjob. The painful sensation was not immediate but one it began I realized it was incredibly painful, much worse than when in my mouth. When I was in the throes of pain after about two minutes I asked her to stop and get the soap. The application of the soap itself did nothing. I immediately stripped and jumped in the shower. I realized that this was a terrible terrible idea. The dawn dishsoap did help though as the pain rather suddenly went away.\n\nMy wife then wanted to try. I warned her it was a lot more painful on genitals than the mouth and she agreed it would be fine. I ate two wings, and like my wife got some extra sauce in my mouth to ensure coverage. I then went down on her using mostly my tongue. She was already very moist so I'm assuming this excited her. After about a minute of tongue punching the little man on the boat she told me to stop and immediately ran to the shower. She prepared ahead of time to jump in the shower by getting naked so she didnt have to deal with it. She then lathered up the area with dawn dish soap and rinsed with. She stated that it was indeed far more painful than just eating wings and that the dawn dish soap in the shower was almost immediate relief.\n\nWhile my wife was getting rid of her pain I decided to put some dawn dish soap in my mouth to see if it helped. It did but it wasnt worth it at all. The amount of rinsing I needed to do to get it out of my mouth was far too much. The soap is incredibly bitter. I would have rather had the burn in my mouth give away naturally over time. It may be worth it if you got something really hot and needed relief but just for some wings I would say let it go away on it's own.",

I add like half a seasoning packet, but it's up to you. \n\nAdditions can be either powdered or fresh - onion, garlic, ginger, bell peppers. A great option is to saut\u00e9e it in sesame oil in a separate pan, adding the base (and gochujang) to that. Once mixed - add the noodles. \n\nTo balance it out, I highly recommend throwing all of that on a bowl of steamed broccoli or spinach. Adding some scrambled egg is always nice too. \n\nWhen I cooked it this while interning in DC, I got my food budget under $100/mo - because I couldn't even finish half a packet of ramen this way. It reheats really well too, the noodles somehow get more springy. You can make a large batch in advance (with seasoning packet, just keep adding spices and peanut butter until it tastes balanced) and fridge it, then just spoon out a bit and reheat in a bowl, then throw noodles on that. 3 minute meal. \n\nI don't know what it'd be called though, if there's a dish close enough to it already (it's too different from pad Thai IMO). Spicy sesame garlic noodles? Spicy peanut sesame garlic noodles? The only thing I make more regularly are the J Kenji Lopez Alt best roasted potatoes.",

I don't necessarily blame him for his reaction, without context, because this could have just been a hookup? I'm sure his adrenaline was firing and he just wanted to be home where he could try and address his situation.

We had this hokey tour where we would take tourists in the backcountry for a few hours and feed them some Dinte Moore, burnt coffee, and fry bread.\n\n\nWe carried bear spray with us because we kept food back there. One of us would go early in the morning and set up the camp.\n\nWell, it was my turn. I'm just out there with my thoughts waiting for the last tour. Now, the whole time we're out there we have to shoo away the squirrels who are relentless for that flour (that we use to make the fry bread). A week earlier my colleague told me he was a little successful with keeping the squirrels away by using the bear spray. I never shot the stuff, so I thought 'why not?'\n\n\nSo empty out the bear spray on the thieving squirrel and it's just wiping it's eyes for a little minute and coming back. So I'm hazing this motherfucker every time he comes back.\n\n\nCue the tourists who light into the Dinte Moore and tell me that's it's spicy. I nearly shit myself thinking I fucked up. 'Was it too much?' I ask? 'Nah, we're from Louisiana, this is good!'\n\nPhew!\n\n\nThe tour ended and break down camp for the day. Before hitting the trail for a damn 1.5 drive back to town, I take a piss in the woods. THAT was my fuck up. As a dude, I didn't think twice about washing my hands, I was done preparing food for the day and was trying to get lost. Nope, nope, nope. 20 minutes into that drive, the burning was unbearable. And then I came across a mother moose who was blocking the trail. There's nothing you can do when that happens...just wait until she's eaten her fill of trail salad.\n\n\nI finally got back to town and the fire in my loins was beginning to subside but damn...I was near tears for most of that ordeal.",

He starts screaming at me that his dick is burning and what the fuck did I do to it?\n\nI understand his screaming as I\u2019m sure he was in pain/ surprised/ scared but I hope this was the only time he\u2019s ever screamed at you.
