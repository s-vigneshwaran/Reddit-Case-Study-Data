  "text": "Grandma tries to teach my kid the biblical Christmas story. It doesn't go the way she had hoped.\nMy mother in law is an evangelical Christian, and my partner and I are agnostic and atheist. We have a 5 year old daughter, and celebrate Christmas in our house as a cultural holiday.\n\nWe decided a while back that our kid is gonna get to make her own decisions regarding belief or lack thereof. We don't sheild her from any religious information or doctrine, but encourage her to use her brain to evaluate claims, rather than simply believing what authority figures tell her is the truth.\n\nWe have an old nativity in our house that's a holdover from prior to our respective deconversions, but we still put it out for the Holidays because the kid likes to play with the figurines and arrange them however she wants to, which we encourage. Mother in law saw the nativity and decided our kid needed to hear the biblical Christmas story. My hackles went up, but I decided to let it be. (The few times Grandma has tried to share her thoughts on Christianity with our daughter, we've just followed up with the kid later and asked her what she thought about the stories she heard earlier from Grandma. ) Mother in law finishes her whole lecture, quizzes our daughter on the cast of characters, and asks what she thinks Christmas is about. Kid pics up some pieces, looks at Grandma and says \"Now I get to make up a story!\"\n\nGood thing I was standing behind mother in law so she couldn't see me laughing.",

Our kids are raised in a loving atheist household. When she was 8, she was invited to a Vacation Bible School (VBS) by a friend. I encouraged her to go. Over the three nights, I looked forward to picking her up and laughing about the stories, and how people acted (we're talking Holy Rollers, speaking in tongues, etc.). It was a valuable experience for her, and it was a proud moment for a dad how she avoided the heavy conversion attempts, etc. She could not believe how absurd everything was.",

I as the atheist couldn't care less about incantations and candles and holy water. That said, I certainly want my kid to grow up questioning everything and ultimately making their own call on a/theism path. Like, if my kid Haas some amazing life experience and wants to become Buddhist, fuck yeah go for it. Or if they say, church sucks I don't wanna go, I'll say l, \"cool, let's go play golf\" or some shit. I don't want my bias to color how my kid decides what to believe, though your point about the religious hegemony is spot on. I'll absolutely bias my kid toward choosing critical thinking. With some of the crazy Christian shit I've seen, especially in white, affluent communities in Texas, I want my kid to please not fall in line with it, not even take one step in that direction from a belief standpoint, but certainly work to understand those beliefs and allow others to hold them.",

For the sake of philosophical discussion, I'll explain.\n\nI think it makes a lot of sense for there to be a perfect absolute, however I would not consider this to be a _person_. God as in the Christian Bible is depicted as a person not unlike those in polytheistic religions (with similar character flaws too), however as you rightly point out this is inconsistent with a monotheistic perfect being.\n\nWe also don't see miracles or anything of the sort. God doesn't intervene in the world.\n\n\"God\" should instead be understood as creative Reason. It is whatever created and upholds the universe, whatever the universe is made of and regulated by. God is not a person but a thing, and as such it makes no more sense to morally judge God than to morally judge nature, for the two are one and the same.\n\nThus first and foremost it is a belief in a logically consistent universe, and secondly a faith in the reason humanity is endowed with which allows us to decipher and understand said universe. As above, so below.\n\nThe universe is \"perfect\" not in that there is no suffering, but in its order and consistency.\n\nThere can still be moral perfection, but as the only conscious beings with a fragment of that divine reason, it is only erring humans who can discover and apply that, so even if Love is indeed a part of that absolute perfection, it is only expressed imperfectly through humans. \n\nThe reason for this failure is simple; humans are of two natures: animal and divine. One doesn't need to believe in a literal separate immaterial soul to see this. We have a great capacity to understand Truth, but at the same time we also have animal desires and instincts which can run counter to living an enlightened life.\n\nOne can see God the Father as contrasted with God the Son (made flesh) as allegorical to this. On the one hand immaterial perfection (as we might envision truth or love in the abstract), on the other a material imperfection (as we might envision a person trying to embody these qualities). With the character of Jesus himself (on principle) embodying human perfection to the fullest extent, thus providing an ideal to aspire to for all men. In such a way Jesus is not entirely distinct from Buddha, and fulfills a very similar religious purpose.\n\nIndeed this would seem much more like the core message of religion, only often communicated through primitive stories which try to personify God as we once personified forests and rivers, or the sun and moon. It is perhaps more immediately understandable to people to tell such stories, but such stories are also obviously untrue.\n\nIn any case, just because ideas are communicated in primitive stories doesn't mean all of them are entirely untrue or lacking in insight.\n\nMy inspirations for these thoughts are Catholic theology, Ancient Greek philosophy, Western Esotericism (primarily gnosticism and the Hermetica), the Enlightenment and the Cult of Reason.",

But the quiz really is just as much a cherry picking of the bible as any church. \n\nThe first question I got is incorrect or at least subject to discussion. Wikipedia says \u201cThe text of the Ten Commandments appears twice in the Hebrew Bible: at Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Deuteronomy 5:6\u201321.\u201d The first question is \u201cWhat is the last of the Ten Commandments?\u201d and the answers are not found in either of those passages; instead, the answer key cites Exodus 34. The explanatory text says that the exodus 20 section isn\u2019t real because Moses merely recited the rules, rather than being engraved on tablets, yet scholars generally agree that the Exodus 20 section are the \u201c10 Commandments\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s really disingenuous to make the same specious arguments that religious people make, trying to trip people up on technicalities. Moreover, followers of the Bible will point out that it has an overemphasis on Mosaic law, which both Jewish and Christian scholars agree is archaic - for example, instead of blood sacrifice, most Jews give money instead; Christians replace the sacrifice with Christ in their belief system. Point being that FFRF is just as hand-wavy as the religious people in this area.\n\nI will add that there\u2019s some good bits in there from the New Testament but there\u2019s just so much more they could pick on!",

We\u2019d drive up on Saturday and drive back Sunday after church. Since the service was in Korean, I would listen to the translator via headphones. On the drive home I would tell my wife about the insane, intolerant bullshit in the sermon. I told her that if it weren\u2019t for her family, I\u2019d tell the pastor how fucked up his sermons are. \n\nYears later I found out that there are two forms of Korean: formal and informal. My wife and her family immigrated when she was two so she learned Korean from her parents because they didn\u2019t speak English when they arrived in the US. Informal Korean is what you use when having a conversation. Formal is used for things like newscasts and religious sermons. \n\nSo all those times in church when I assumed my wife understood the sermon, in fact she didn\u2019t because it was in formal Korean which she really doesn\u2019t understand. She told me once that she can\u2019t watch Korean news because she doesn\u2019t know what they are saying.",

That's fucking child abuse....But I guess she also didn't stop sending us to churches even when her young kid was sexually abused by her pastor uncle, repeatedly, over and over, for years either (the signs were fucking there! and she ignored them.) I don't know what her fucking deal is.\n\nThis turned into more of rant/vent comment than I initially meant for it to, whoops! Clearly I'm still working shit out, haha. It's just something parents really need to be aware of and actively combat so their poor kids don't turn out all traumatized and fucked up like so many of us (including me.)",

It works to the extent that we all agree to a set of rules and live by them. Those rules are based upon how we interact with reality. When others raise their kids to be unable to think critically because that would call their faith into question, when they ignore science, when they vote for laws that take away my freedom because it violates some rule of their religion, that affects me. It slows the progress of mankind.\n\nLook into our past. Millions upon millions of people have died in wars that were fought purely over a difference in faith. Look at how many of the anti-vaccine crowd are religious. It\u2019s not a coincidence. \n\nWe have one tool we can use to tell fact from fiction and that\u2019s empirical evidence. Faith is the opposite of that. Once you no longer require evidence, you can believe in anything you want and that\u2019s delusional. If you don\u2019t interact with society that\u2019s not a problem but 99.999% of us do. \n\nSo yes, I respect atheists a little more than I respect people of faith. It\u2019s the same reason I rely on the sane just a little more than the slightly insane. \n\nWe can pretend that a person\u2019s faith doesn\u2019t affect anyone else but that\u2019s delusional. Of course it does. Once you are ok believing in something because it feels good rather than because it\u2019s empirically true, that\u2019s going to invade your thinking in other areas and that\u2019s not good for society. \n\nI can\u2019t change that.

Your waiting will bite you in the ass. If you have been vegetarian, and your MIL would be ostensibly feeding your kid meat in front of you with snarky comments, would you wait until kid grows up and tells her himself?\n\nSorry for being so undiplomatically direct, this is partly because of my similar expirience where it took me a while to realize I have to intervene, and partly I am mad at these Christians arrogance, where they misuse other people's good will and decency for their own gain in a sneeky manner.\n\nYou have parents - grandparents relationship issue, not god - nogod worldview issue.

You spend much more time with them than granny.  You can undo anything she teaches.  I use it as a benefit.  Its really good for the kids to understand what religious people believe and how they think.  At least for mine it is.

I only say this because one does not need to claim to believe a god does not exist in order to be an atheist - they simply just need to not hold an active god belief.\n\nBy definition, theism and atheism only address the state of belief, whereas gnosticism and agnosticism address the knowledge level. Ultimately, the idea matters more than a label ever could, but for the sake of friendly and completely non-hostile discussion, anyone who does not hold an active god belief is, by definition, an atheist. Whereas theism means one thing only (\"I believe a god exists\"), atheism can mean either \"I don't believe a god exists\" or \"I believe no god exists.\" I trust you can see the distinction between the two atheism qualifiers, but if not, I'm happy to elaborate.\n\nAnyway, as a future father, I think often about how to handle the whole idea one day with my kid. People like you and your wife, as well as other commenters here, are all very helpful, and your insight is more valuable than you know. So thanks for that.",

But to 'know' something, I mean to *really* know it, and if that thing is an *external truth* (i,e not related to your own feelings/emotion, but an external force/being separate from you) you need to provide some evidence.  \nMost *smart* religious people understand this distinction, and will push back with 'faith is not about knowing, it's about believing', and to them I say 'fine, but you don't *know* then do you?

But agnostic wasn't really addressed by the church, so I was comfortable transitioning to that label.  It was the same with admitting that I was no longer conservative, but having to get over the label of liberal and the negative feelings I was conditioned to have with that label.

Because the default position is not having a belief system, because belief systems are universally adopted. Nobody is born with their religion, so the default is not having one. \n\n> As I said, 5 year olds believe in the tooth fairy, Santa, that disney princesses are real\u2026 \n\nLmao I bet this 5 year old would react the same if someone asked if they prayed to the tooth fairy, Santa, or a Disney princess\n\n> if they are this certain god doesn\u2019t exist it\u2019s not from their own opinion, it\u2019s from listening to the parents.\n\nThey didn\u2019t say \u201cI am certain god doesn\u2019t exist\u201d, they said \u201cI don\u2019t believe in god\u201d.

If they ask about religion, any religion, you need to be able to explain to them what people actually believe and what it is, not a biased take.\n\nAnd kids make up stuff all the time, not even lies like Santa.

FIL calls me and my daughter up to stand in a circle with everyone. Guest pastor goes around one by one and I'm watching the door like a hawk for wife to come back. He gets to my daughter and asks if she can have communion... I look at FIL... no help from him, so I say quietly to guest pastor \"if it's ok with you it's ok with me\" Sorry, I'm not going to make up an answer. Guest pastor says \"well, can she or can't she?\" Clearly embarrassed and annoyed FIL steps in and says no she can't. Everyone looks like a scandal just occurred. So embarrassing, but in laws have only themselves to blame for insisting we attend. Service ends, find wife in the kitchen eating donuts with brothers and friends who also skipped mass. There were words had later that night, I can tell you!",

I knew it would be awkward either way but there often seem to be people who don\u2019t go up for one reason or another (actually a good question\u2014why do religious people choose to not go up??). My son said indeed it felt better not to go up and he wasn\u2019t the only one.",

Grandpa said it was much more important to do good things and always try to change one person's day for the better, Leave the world better than when you arrived, and to reflect and listen to others perspectives. He was still a devout Catholic but that always resonated deeply for me. Keep up the good work OP! Your kiddo is doing great!",

Like most brain skills, it comes when the child is ready. I\u2019m specifically thinking of cringey podcast clips of Stefan Molyneux manipulating his 5-year old child, who is clearly just trying to find the answers that will please her father. Reference here in this RationalWiki article: https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Stefan_Molyneux\n\nThis is NOT a critique of OP. Just mainly wanted to join an interesting conversation and present a seemingly well-presented website on working with your children on critical thinking.",

My kid came home and told me what the Trinity was, because his teacher told him.  So we just discuss it.

On the other hand, I can see the strategy in keeping the relics of an otherwise-discarded religion for use as meaningless toys to rob them of their power.\n\nBut I think you're being a little ungenerous to Grandma. She explained the background of one of your family's customs, and there's a difference between e.g. \"Jesus came back from the dead after three days\" and \"_Christians believe that_ Jesus came back from the dead after three days.\" You're just delaying the day your daughter finds out that this story is something that lots of people believe rather than something Grandma made up on the spot, at Grandma's expense.",

I told him it was okay because that's where I was with my belief for the longest time too. Believing that acting the part would get me in heaven at the very least until I realized how much I beat myself up every time I would mess up even a little bit. Also the people at church helped me a lot to realize I was not one of them. I live in the south with a latino husband and 2 mixrd kids. Most of the congregation was racist and after the election of Trump the pastor started preaching politics. Realized they're all so brainwashed it isn't even funny.

You should encourage your kid to find deeper meaning in things instead of just blowing off certain subjects just because you particularly don\u2019t believe in the basis of the information.

Your comment was in response to this statement in the post:\n\n>my partner and I are agnostic and atheist\n\nI interpreted that statement as\n\n>my partner and I are agnostic and atheist [respectfully]\n\nOr even if they should have written\n\n>my partner and I are [atheist and agnostic respectfully]\n\nIt doesn't change the post significantly and it doesn't invalidate what was stated.
