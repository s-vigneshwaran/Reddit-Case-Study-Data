I poured my heart and soul into writing that comment, and took the risk of revealing my true innermost feelings, only to be viciously attacked and downvoted.I was so excited when I wrote that comment. I thought it was well thought and honest. I thought people would read it, agree or disagree, and move on. But then..you took my happiness away with the click of a button. I was then told I would not be able to post for 9 minutes. Not only was my dignity taken away, but my ability to write another comment was revoked. I was punished for daring to reveal my soul to the world.I am literally shaking right now. I don't know how I will move on or survive this incident. My mind will forever be wracked with the painful torment of wondering: who? why? Will there ever be justice?Some day, I will tell this story to my grandchildren. It will serve as a reminder of just how cruel the world can be. I hope the future generations can build a world that is better than our own, one where nobody has to suffer the extreme pain and torment of being downvoted.In the mean time, it is going to take a lot of therapy and time to recover from this trauma. I might even need to look into adopting a comfort llama to help me get through every day life. Right now all my mind is capable of focusing on are the horrible flashbacks.\n\nalso pls stop replying hurtful things to me bc im very sad rn",
