But the TV is big enough and high enough that people's heads don't pass in front of it. \n\nI'm watching the screen and 5\u00b0 below that I just see someone's eyes connect with mine and as I slightly lower my eyes to see what I thought I saw there was this girl who wasn't even that attractive who got this look of disgust on her face like she had just been ogled by I don't know.... Ted Bundy or something. \n\nI looked away and turned forward because for a moment there I was actually afraid of the trouble that might come. I really really regret that action. \n\nWhenever this thought pops into my head I wish I just would have started smirking and then done that thing where you point two fingers at your eyes and then point one above her head to the big TV. Of course that might not have embarrassed her and even if it did that would turn into the feeling of rejection for her which can be even more dangerous than just being caught looking. \n\nAt least when you caught looking you didn't reject them they get to reject you. But if you signal \"ha, no sweetheart I was watching the game. I pay more attention to that than you\" some of them will f****** kill you... Well they won't..  they'll get some betasimp proxy agent to do it for them.",

I mean sorry about your troubles but yeah these women now are kicking in doors and inciting mobs against people and you're not allowed to do anything to retaliate. I was just in the initial stages with a neighbor girl last summer, she's 21...I was 45. Her mother used to live in the building but hasn't for a year. And then she found out that me and her daughter were building a flower garden together and that we were going to have a mutual birthday party.\n\nHer mother who doesn't have a car arranged a ride came to my apartment and started kicking the door down and I had to call 911 and then when the police showed up she played the whole I'm just a girl I just wanted to talk to him b*******. \n\nAnd then was showing up almost every day for weeks screaming and yelling and inciting the neighbors who were all f***** up meth head losers so they all joined in and I ended up getting thrown out of the building by police and arrested for harassment when it was them that was harassing me.\n\nWe haven't had our day in court yet. The crown attorney offered me what is called a peace Bond which is basically saying I promise to be good and they'll drop all the charges. But I already lost my apartment and a job over this. Most people would have taken it but then they said that I needed to attend counseling so that I don't reoffend and I drew the line. I told them I'm moving forward with trial.\n\nI have multiple audio recordings of their harassment of me and the girl who tried to rewrite history by saying that I was harassing her for 4 months... I have 4 months worth of Facebook conversations between me and her that were completely normal. \n\nThere are no consequences for these false accusations and even the innocent have to pay a price because the world still protects women and assumes that men are predators. \n\nThere will never be equality as long as this continues which means there will never be equality because women like the power and privilege to be able to make accusations like this without any consequences because women hate accountability.

But you do realize that this woman in the picture, Andrea Heinz, joined the sex industry because she had gotten herself into a lot of debt by 22 due to bad life choices and then made millions of dollars doing it, and then opened up a brothel for other women during the last 4 years of her career. So if she was being raped for her entire experience, I highly doubt she would have opened a brothel for other women to get raped too.\n\nThis is what we're making fun of. A transactional relationship that you agree to is not rape, especially if you consented to it.\n\nShe by the way is completely sex-negative, and believes that all sex work is bad for women, even heavily regulated.\n\n>Also, sex-negative self proclaimed feminists are not that rare. The entirety of FDS is anti-sex work, and they seem to be called feminists in your book.\n\nFDS is a group of extremists and is the most hated sub on reddit. Most Feminists would not identify those women among themselves. We call them Feminists because that's what they call themselves.",

There are only a few survivors. In fact, there are only two. And you wake up after the first one does. By the time that you have woken up, the other survivor in this plane has claimed all of the coconuts on all of the coconut trees, stacked them on their piles, sheltered that pile from all the wreckage from the plane, declared they own it, and they say that they would be willing to give you said coconuts if you throat their cock. Now would you consider that to be a voluntary interaction?",
