The Boomers benefitted wildly from our exploitation of EU through the Marshall Plan after WWII and creation of the Petrodollar.\n\nThey as individuals didn't have it good because of their individual efforts. They had it good because of collective political action followed by happenstance of geography and capital.\n\nAlso keep in mind 'they had it good' is in contrast to the overwhelming majority who don't have it good. Detroit became a racialized ghetto because during WWII blacks came up to work in factories, and at the end of the war they all got shit-canned so whites could have their jobs back. Then capital deindustrialized, the better paid whites left, the destitute blacks stayed in the ghettos.. And you get the mess that exists today.\n\nAlso keep in mind a majority of USians have it awful. I haven't looked up statistics in a long time, but we're generally poor as fuck in terms of cost of living.\n\nBut yeah, sorry. Meemaw and Pawpaw didn't have it good because they were industrious. They had it good as historical coincidence. Had they been born black for example... lol.\n\nAnyways. That was a fuckin rant.",

That is no longer \"ironic\". Thats just called being a fan. But they can't call themselves fans because then they're not cool in their hipster circles? \n\nI swear being non-conformist is so much more conformist than what non-conformists consider conformist.

They don\u2019t know how to become productive members of society that contribute absolutely anything, and they\u2019re scared beyond their ability to communicate. \n\nThis is an image of two individuals so incredibly deep in denial that they want people online to attack them so they can numb themselves even more against the facts of their situation. \n\nThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever written on this sub.
