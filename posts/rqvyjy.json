These three steps create \u201cprobable cause\u201d, reasonable suspicion that shoplifting had taken place.\nApprehend the shoplifter inside or near the store.\nUsage of reasonable, non-deadly force if any force is necessary.

Even back then the analog cameras were able to zoom in to the keyboard and screen so they could watch what was being typed and displayed. They regularly caught employees ringing up items for their friends or coworkers and pretending to have an issue scanning an item and typing in an incorrect sku intentionally as well as other shannigans. That info was always on a report the following day, but they'd catch it instantly by zooming in on the screen and they could see clearly every letter on they keyboard and monitor. I could only imagine how it's only improved over time... A company like Walmart will definitely spend the money to have that ability to zoom in thst close, especially in areas with high theft like makeup, pharmacy, and over the registers. I'm sure someone who actually works there can chime in and confirm.",

Yes, they had cameras pointed at the registers, as well as stationary cameras throughout the store, but also had  PTZ cameras which overlapped the coverage of the stationary cameras and the PTZ cameras could be panned and zoomed just as close as the ones pointed over the registers. I actually had one of those cameras from another facility I worked at when I changed from retail to IT, those cameras were something like $2K each and gigantic due to the optics in them. This was a big box store which at the time was larger than Walmart, so it wouldn't surprise me if Walmart had similar ability, especially with the advancements in technology and reduction in costs.",

Definitely able to zoom to distinguishable levels for faces though. \n\nAt another business that i run, a recording studio, my cameras are a bit more expensive. The ceiling is lower though there, and what i\u2019d be zooming in on is closer. there i might be able to see texts. \n\n\nWhile it\u2019s plausible walmart would spend good money on security due to their annnual loss as well as just value of inventory, you also have to think of their high ceilings, that they expect some loss. \n\nI don\u2019t think text viewing is true but i think it\u2019s not implausible.",

It\u2019s not too crazy to think that a private company would invest in security systems that allow them to capture people stealing so they can make insurance claims on items. The real reason Walmart doesn\u2019t stop you from stealing is that they make more money from insurance claims than actually just putting the stolen product back on the shelf.\n\nEdit: for reference. This Walmart in particular is about 500 ish feet from the camera they were using and the shoe aisle. The LP was flexing the camera system and could use a closer camera to achieve the same job. There are a lot more cameras than you think inside your local Walmart, and most are tracking what you\u2019re doing by some track ball wizard in a security room. Most cameras that cost decent money can zoom that much and hold fidelity. See also telephoto zoom lenses, same concept.",

It\u2019s walmart, they have an annual revenue of 300 billion dollars, their total shrinkage amount is about 3 billion. So you think this multi billion dollar corporation won\u2019t spent a couple thousand dollars in security? This is the same company that in about 1,000 stores is using AI to track shoppers habits with even more cameras looking down every aisle so that the store can change up its planogram. This is the same store that is obsessed with lowering the cost of shrinkage from 3 billion to 0 and the way they think they can do it is by adding more security and paying local police to patrol stores with high theft rates, like the one I used to work at.",

The store literally paid cops to be there all the time and yeah, over a certain dollar amount they would call the police but most the time they would get a wrap sheet on the person that steals and when that person comes back into the store they call the cops for intent and have evidence of them stealing. Who says that they sit there and call the cops the moment someone shows intent to steal? Those camera systems are used to monitor. You would know that if you actually work security and have been inside the security room. \n\nNot to mention you keep mentioning price without realizing that Walmart doesn\u2019t pay full price for security suites like that and most the time breaks deals with other companies to come and install the security cameras for them and pay wholesale since they would be buying a shit ton of cameras for a lot of stores. So yeah, a few thousand dollars doesn\u2019t seem that far off when you consider that the cameras can be run off the old computer systems they already set up in the early 2000\u2019s.",

I was implying that there is no point for cameras good enough to see what is on someone\u2019s phone. A camera that is 1080p wouldn\u2019t be able to make out stuff on someone\u2019s phone. You might be able to tell if they are in a texting app or something but that\u2019s about it. But the resolution would be more than enough to get a face and see what they are doing which is what companies actually care about. Companies don\u2019t want to spend more money then they need to. Why would they spend so much extra money on cameras that can see your phone when they don\u2019t need to? That\u2019s just a dumb business decision.\n\nThe cameras we have at the factory have a higher resolution recording, but because we have such an old computer running them we had to lower the live stream quality of them drastically because the computer just couldn\u2019t up keep.\n\nI\u2019m not saying they have bad cameras, I\u2019m just saying a camera so good they could read the texts off your phone just seems extremely unlikely, and definitely is not the norm for a Walmart.",

Whether that qualifies as \"small town\" can be up for debate, though it may depend on the state. In some states, \"town\" has a legal meaning that's tied to population, other states it has legal meaning tied to something other than population, and still other states it has no legal meaning at all. In Alabama, towns have less than 2000 population. In Louisiana, towns have population between 1000 and 6000. In New Jersey, towns need at least 5000 population. Towns in Utah can't have more than 1000 population. Towns in Washington have to be less than 1500 population when they incorporate, but can grow and still be a town. Wyoming towns have less than 4000 population.",

So I open it and say, how can I help you sir.\n\nHe says \"Do you know why I'm here?\"\n\nI'm like, uhh no?\n\nThen he goes on to ask me where I've been, so I say a few stores, and finally when I get to Walmart he says, yeah, I'm here because someone said they saw you stealing tic tacs.\n\nI'm like, you're joking right?\n\nHe was not joking, so I went and grabbed the bag in my room, brought it to him with the receipt, and he was like alright, I'm going to go check the camera footage lol.\n\nI said, so what should I do? He said if I see anything on the camera I'll come back.\n\nNever saw him again, and I've always told Walmart people to fuck off when I leave and they want to check my bag.\n\nNah, but I did tell this one lady who always grabbed my bag, I swear and I'm going to get downvoted for this, but I live in a rich white area, and I'm white, and this Walmart lady at the door happens to be black.\n\nShe would constantly sort through all of my shit everytime I got stuff, and at first I was like, I think she's just doing her job well, but she started saying ass hole things to me, so one day she asks to see my bag and I just said get fucked, I shop here twice a week.\n\nI genuinely think she liked having this weird power to hold people up with her magical power, I didn't have a cart with 100 items, I would have a single bag with 3-4 items, so I got sick of it and told her off, noone bothers me anymore, so clearly it was just her being a bitch.\n\nI gave her the benefit of the doubt, but she abused her \"powers\" and fucked around and found out.",

He did that for about a week until (you guessed it) the LP guys caught him. He made it out the door and someone pushed or tripped him into the concrete barrier pole things that stick out of the ground. Ambulance was called, the whole 9 yards.",

There are some people with computer science degrees who have a hard time getting into the field so it's not all roses. \n\nThose that don't have a computer science degree go the \"coding boot camp\" route.

Apparently calling out of work to be there for that and help out afterwards meant threatening my job was on the table.\n\nSo when we had motherfuckers come in to steal TV's or whatever I would Tobey McGuire Peter Parker myself out of their way if I was near an exit because I wasn't even getting into a verbal disagreement for Walmart let alone putting any effort into stopping theft for a company that fucking greedy. \n\nLiterally had to explain to a manager they don't own my time and if my shift ends at 7 AM and I've got a doctor's appointment at 8 AM they can't hold me until 7:45 AM like I'm sort of corporate slave who puts the needs of the store first. \n\nFuck that whole chain. Like a god damn cult too telling us how grateful we should be that Sam Walton thought of the workers and made the amazing company that is Walmart and how without him things would be so much worse for us because the job market options are so bad like Walmart hasn't killed off numerous small town businesses with its shitty fucking practices.",

                          "text": "Isn\u2019t it crazy that not too long ago internet dating had a whole stigma too it and was considered a bit of a nerdy thing or just for very pervy people too hook up casually.  Like on TV if it showed a couple who met online they would be badly dressed, with thick glasses and very geeky personalities.  \n\nAnd then eHarmony or whatever legitimatized it a bit by focusing on scientific compatibility or whatever, with the rest of its competitors copying pretty quickly.  And people suddenly were okay with it because it was \u201cfinding a sincere relationship\u201d.  A bit later Tinder and Grindr debuts and the hook up component moves back front and center with it, but is now way more acceptable.  \n\nOf course before internet dating there was video dating.  I don\u2019t know how far spread it really was, but it\u2019s been immortalized in pop culture because as it turns out a video personals ad asking for a date is a great set up for a character sketch.  The last several pages of whatever free papers where around town would usually have some form of personals as well.  These would overwhelmingly be prostitution, or men looking for a live in prostitution situation (free rent for young ladies\u2026.) But there would also be a small number of sincere ads of people genuinely looking for connections and real relationships.  \n\nThat\u2019s a head trip.  Imagine a blind date with someone and the only interaction has been a five line classified ad and perhaps a few short phone calls.  No pics or anything, because there really isn\u2019t a practical way to exchange them back then.  It\u2019s a wonder that you didn\u2019t hear of way more cat fishes and scams.  It\u2019s not like today where you can research a person to some extent at least. But I suppose  the total number of people using any of these services was so small that maybe whatever scams came from it was barely a big enough problem to register.\n\nIt just goes to show though that it\u2019s always been a challenge for adults to meet and date new people.  Or new friends for that matter.  Most of us spend our time in two or three little bubbles and if we don\u2019t have someone there it can be very difficult.  Home, work,  maybe church or sport or some kind of social club we participate in regularly.  Either way it\u2019s a limited pool of people.  And so we then turn to people in those groups and ask them to maybe bring in other friends, but of course frequently they have no one who would be a suitable partner.  So what do you make friends and meet potential partners at a bar or club?  Sure, but it\u2019s a particular type of person there and really it\u2019s not for everyone.  It\u2019s not for most people, certainly not once you get a little older.  Are you going to start introducing yourself to people at the grocery store?  Some people can actually pull that off believe it or not, but most of us can\u2019t do the cold introduction like that.  It\u2019s hard not to weird people out now a days.\n\nIt really starts to make more sense why so many cultures have a role of a matchmaker or such.  Perhaps you aren\u2019t matched with someone perfect.  Perhaps you don\u2019t love them like some kind of Disney version of love where your heart flutters and your whole body turns warm at the sight of them.  But you still get along, and it\u2019s better to be together then to be alone.  And with time people together do begin to love each other.  Many people matched by parents or matchmakers have long happy marriages and love each other deeply by the end of it.  Sharing a life with someone will do that.\n\nI\u2019m not saying bring back matchmakers btw.  It doesn\u2019t make sense in modern times, and we are seeing that apps are filling that niche they left behind (to an extent).  Im just trying to keep this wall of text going as long as possible.  You see sometimes I start writing a comment and I find I\u2019ve meandered quite a ways off track, and then I think, \u201cI wonder how long I can keep this up?\u201d  I admit it\u2019s downright abusive to the reader.  I\u2019m not trying to provide good info or edifying writing of any sort, I\u2019m just fucking around for my own sake.  And when I get to this meta point it\u2019s usually time I call it quits.  So that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be doing.",

They sound like they're in an acting class, or a bad community theater production.\n\nAlso, the whole setup doesn't make much sense. Take individually, none of it is proof alone, but all put together, it doesn't make much sense. Why are you filming yourself in the middle of a Walmart trying on a shirt, unless you're trying to setup a fake Tik Tok to go viral? With how stable and well framed he is in the shot, he probably has a tripod, and the \"Walmart employee\" knows to approach such that they're in frame, but then pretend they don't know the camera is there? And as others have pointed out, he isn't even in the t-shirt section. \n\nFinally, and most damning, loss prevention, or any Walmart employee, is not going to hassle you for trying on a shirt in the store. It is quite specifically against their policies, even if they do suspect you of stealing, at best they are allowed to ask you \"do you need any help with anything?\" It's not until you leave with the item that they are allowed to intervene, and even then, they're usually not allowed to confront someone for stealing.\n\nPS: who actually talks like this?\n\nI can't believe I'm explaining this, it's so fucking obvious, if you're duped by thus then you are very na\u00efve.",

Everyone knows this (even though it may not be as intricate from store to store) and the fact that it was a shirt and not something like a jacket/sweatshirt that you can put on top of your clothing makes me question his motives for filming.",

They then save recordings of the security tapes of the people stealing. They then sometimes pass out pictures or the person to the other asset protection people in the area. The store or stores then record the people shoplifting over and over again until they've stolen enough to be charged with grand theft. Getting someone for a $10 shirt isn't going to do much. They'll just be back and doing it again after possibly doing community service. That's why they wait for them to show up at the store after they've stolen enough to do legit time and call the cops when they first come and the cops wait for them to come out. No risk of anyone getting hurt, no risk of being sued, shoplifter goes away for a significantly longer time, and the store has all the info documented to turn into insurance.",

I have literally walked out with tvs in my basket without anybody even questioning me when the little alarms beeped. They dont give a fuck until youre like my dumb self and do it everyday for years straight, let loss preventions notice you and just build a case on you.(did my time for it and paid my dues) when I finally had them stop me with about 10 employees just standing in my way trying to stop me without touching me with a cop already outside I knew I was fucked. So yeah most employees inside the store dont give a single fuck even if they saw you throw something down your pants or backpack then walk right out.\n\nEdit: not encouraging stealing just saying even employees dont care if youre trying on a shirt even if youre gonna steal it. Lady should just mind her business or ask that he goes to the fitting room if she is an employee.",

There\u2019s just no way. Like I said, if I hadn\u2019t done what I did, there\u2019s a list of steps I follow- a protocol for every illness- that someone else doubtlessly would have. And while I bring my own knowledge to the table, so does everyone else. There are plenty of passionate medics. \n\nAnd so there\u2019s my philosophy, I guess. Us worker ants are just as important to the world as the Big Names, the people who leave monoliths, but not individually. We\u2019re important as a collective. The profession of EMS, or of a garbage man, or of a store manager, is surely important, but the individuals filling those roles are just performing their job. While they\u2019re at work, they\u2019re just cogs in a machine. \n\nNote, this isn\u2019t the same as saying that you shouldn\u2019t ever put extra effort in; I just think that it should be proportional to what you\u2019re doing, and not based solely on a sense of \u201cpride in work.\u201d Working for Walmart? Best you can do is help the bosses see a few extra bucks in their bottom line, so I say it\u2019s not worth it. Working in medicine? It\u2019s for the good of your patients to stay on top of current research and every extra bit of effort helps. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve always worked so hard even though I, individually, feel completely replaceable. I know that it\u2019s what a good medic does",

They'd pull me off the register to go work in the office. I guess they didn't account for all the work we did. I was now working my old job at my new lower pay. The amount of fucks I gave was below zero. \n\nOne morning, before they'd pull me off the register, I was ringing a family up. I scanned all the items on the belt and hit total. The CSM came and, of course, told me I was needed in the office. Then I noticed the family had a BBQ (over $500) I had forgot to ring up. I deactivated the alarm sensor in the BBQ, handed them their receipt, and wished them a nice day. I hope they enjoyed their free BBQ.",

If you're seriously trying to steal a *toaster* you've probably got enough problems. The only time I would ask the LP to follow/check on someone is if it was a dude creeping on me/one of the other employees or someone who seemed sick/drugged out/violent and like they might pass out/hurt someone, etc. The LP I was friends with was also partially security. \n\nI never realized how many retail workers get harassed by customers for their number. I had to save one by pretending to be his girlfriend because this middle aged cougar wouldn't leave him alone. A guy asked me when I got off work and I lied, he followed me around the store for two hours before I went and grabbed the LP guy. Another literally kept walking two feet behind me and complimenting me. Then tried to follow me into the back room. And I'm not even that attractive, I just have that kind of nonthreatening face that people feel like they can come up and ask questions. I hate to think of how many times the girls with pretty hair and nails got harassed",

      "text": "My friend worked in loss prevention at Meijers for a while... I have no idea if Walmart functions the same way as Meijers but I'll hazard a guess at \"basically\". At Meijers, non-loss-prevention employees weren't allowed to approach customers whom they suspected of stealing, they were supposed to notify the loss prevention people of a potential shoplifter. But even *then* it wS only really on big losses like alcohol or other expensive items, or \"repeat customers\".\n\nFor example: if they saw little sammy here stealing a $10 shirt they wouldn't care (i mean, it wouldn't be worth the time it took to do the entire loss prevention process in the case of a shoplifter) but if little sammy came in frequently and consistently acted suspiciously and they suspected that he was repeatedly stealing, now its a loss big enough to pursue. But by that I mean they would watch for sammy to enter the store and call in the police and hopefully catch sammy before he left without tipping him off because they want to catch him, and if he leaves they can't do anything until he comes back again. Also, they aren't allowed to put their hands on sammy or any other customer at all.\n\nSo, this person doesn't look like a Walmart employee (but then, my friend who worked in loss prevention always looked like a normal customer so as not to tip someone off.) But if they do work in loss prevention i would be shocked if this was their proper procedure. So I think this is just your normal everyday karen.",

Especially since it\u2019s damn near impossible to try something on in a Walmart dressing room. When you try a hat on do you go to the dressing room. I mean it looks pretty suspicious trying one on in the middle of a store. I have kids, I have had them try on shirts in the middle of a store more times then I can count. Why?

This is an asset protection associate for Walmart who is accusing the boy of stealing, which they should never do until they gather their \u201c5 elements\u201d and after he has passed all last points of sale. \n\nThe only thing I could think as to why she stopped this young man and hassled him was because she figured he was a minor. Minors work a bit differently when apprehended. She would have had to call his parents and if they didn\u2019t show up within the allotted time they would have had to call the police to get the boy. Maybe she thought that if she nipped it in the bud she wouldn\u2019t have to deal with anything later. But, this is not appropriate for someone in her position. \n\nAnd to those who say Walmart doesn\u2019t have good cameras, it really depends on the area. In a small town they\u2019ll most likely have lower quality cameras compared to the city where they have higher quality cameras.",

      "text": "I\u2019ve worked in Loss Prevention also and this LP shouldn\u2019t be in that position. How this gets handled, if the $5 shirt is really worth it, is the LP sends an associate to that area to do some \u201crecovery and customer service,\u201d have them customer service the shopper then report back the shopper\u2019s reaction (shoplifters always get defensive when you ask them if they are finding everything okay). The LP should monitor and make notes about the customer: approximately what time the entered, what they had on, what their actions are and have been. If the customer removes stickers, tags, or begins to layer or otherwise conceal store property than the LP would go in to further customer service, at which point they would likely notify a manager in the store, as a situation may be occurring. \n\nPutting clothes on in the aisle is tacky by my standards, and I\u2019ve certainly asked customers to take their items to the fitting room to try on, but we\u2019re living in a time where fitting rooms aren\u2019t always available. To kick someone out who is trying on shirts, with no seeable evidence that they are tampering with or destroying company assets, is a great way to escalate a situation. This has a greater probability to needlessly cost the company assets (none more important than time) then the value of the item could replace. A manager would absolutely have a fit with this LP if they have to spend the next hour dealing with a pissed off mother who was shopping in electronics for a new family TV when all of this was going down. \n\nFrom a company stand point think of it like this, the cost of a shirt for Wal Mart if stolen: probably well under $2 vs cost of a lost sale, return customer, leaving your store venerable while you stop Capone here, and the hourly wage of everyone who must intervene in this crisis. As an Assistant Manager, I once had an LP do something like this with some nail polish, and long story short, by the end of it the customer got the nail polish and $25 gift card, not to mention the ass chewing I got from my DM after it got all the way up to her after the collective \u201cwe\u201d couldn\u2019t resolve it at the store level. So, LPs don\u2019t let DMs find out that you cost the store money and production by protecting a $2 item with all your moral conviction.",

When my son was 12, he went to the mall with his grandparents.  He walked into his favorite store Toys R Us.  A staffer dropped him from walking in citing store policy that anyone under 16 cannot enter the store with an adult (my son frequented this store and was never challenged like this).  He was raised to always respect a person in authority and in this case, he said ok and was about to leave.  But the staffer said he was not allowed to leave now because he was underage.  They called mall security and they interrogated him about his grandparents.  They eventually called the grandparents who arrived.  The mall cop lectured my in laws and my son who by now was in tears.  When I found out about this I was livid.  I went straight to the top of Toys R Us, the owners of the mall and the head of the mall security.  My point was my son was illegally detained.  In the end, the store manager, the mall manager and the security manager met with my son and I.. and each personally apologized to my son.  Toys R Us offered him a $100 gift card which we declined.  They wouldn't let us speak to to staffer.  Ironically, as my son was receiving the apologies, I watched 3 kids under the age of 12 walk into into store.. Needless to say, what was my son's favorite store was no more...",

If your store has a high volume of theft, it does make you overly suspicious of people and employees start to have lessening patience. An employee snapped a beat up a shop lifter not too long ago. The video was circulating for while on here. \n\nAssuming this is real (it's difficult to tell these days), the employee is clearly wrong.
