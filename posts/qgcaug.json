                              "text": ">These people are so fucking weak they compare being asked to wear a mask to Applebee\u2019s with the Holocaust.\n\nUnfortunately, they don't make that false offensive \"comparison\" because they're genuinely concerned about masks, they're using it to dogwhistle Holocaust Denial. Comparing mask mandates is intentionally trivializing the Holocaust, which is the most pervasive, and socially acceptable form of Holocaust Denial. Propaganda depicting a COVID mask as being the equivalent to being forcibly ghettoized, pillaged, enslaved, raped, banned from sidewalks, owning businesses, holding any political office/state employment, voting, military (stripping Jewish-German WWI heroes of their medals), writing, fraternizing with non-Jews, removing their own money from the bank, communicating to any family or contacts on the outside about what was happening, etc \u2014 because let us not forget that **the yellow stars were *only* seen in public** *before* the remaining Jews (those not already \"disappeared\" before Nazis seized power, massacred in state-sanctioned pogroms, shot in the streets by Nazi goons & militia, etc \u2014 the mass murders within Germany's borders that still go uncounted) were deported to concentration & death camps largely out of public view; is the same as saying that absolutely none of the human rights abuses and atrocities that I just listed, of which I *only* named those most visible to the public at the time, *never happened.*\n\nThey're not displaying ignorance or stupidity, they're displaying vile Antisemitic hatred. While the public at large chooses to interpret this as an attack on public health guidelines via an incredibly ridiculous & inappropriate depiction of \"persecution\" \u2014 those who actually suffer from the cultural trauma of both the Holocaust AND having to grapple with how it's history's perceived & skewed by their own peers, teachers, \"friends,\" employers, lovers, acquaintances, those in positions of great authority, public figures, politicians, etc \u2014 see it for exactly what it really is: an attack on their very existence. An attack on history. An attack on the very psyche of their targets, who are eternally dismissed by all whom they dare confide in. \n\nEven when Neo-Nazis march the streets, American Jews are expected to be the first to denounce this shit as a serious threat for reasons absolutely nobody is willing to admit. Nobody ever wants to hear Jews even reference the Holocaust or trauma from Antisemitism they've experienced in their lifetime; right now more than ever. Suffer in silence. Get upset \u2014 be branded a \"neurotic Jew\" who \"needs to get over it already.\" We're barely 70 yrs out from the last Jews being \"liberated,\" either through emigration, since the countries they called home & societies they contributed to for centuries refused to allow them to return; or through death. And of those lucky emigrants who survived, they were forced into silence for decades, never believed, and majority died without ever getting to tell their story because for some odd reason people tend to get really enraged at the \"torture\" of having to hear it. That's just one of many Jewish genocides, but it's only acknowledged to either minimize the rest, or to falsely equivocate other shit to it. Genocides should never be compared to begin with, and other non-genocidal atrocities should never be classified as such because the word \"genocide\" altogether has lost its meaning. As has the Holocaust \u2014 a German word, mind you. Nothing else can be called a \"Holocaust,\" because the word has a singular meaning. \"Concentration Camp\" is the English translation for what a sterilized term the Nazis created to refer to their slave labor & extermination camps. That word has also lost all meaning. We have the terminology to discuss the different methods used in racial cleansing, such as prison camps and re-education camps, but media pundits and talkshow activists often call them \"concentration camps\" or \"a Holocaust\" instead; which not only trivializes the Holocaust, but is an inaccurate descriptor for the specific tactics and methods being used against different marginalized groups historically and in the present day. \n\nTaking into consideration all that context I just gave, the point I want everyone to understand is that the \"mask mandate = yellow star\" hate campaign, and the majority reaction, especially by so-called liberals, that are oh so \"offended\" by it for every reason BUT the fact that it's actually Holocaust Denial; are perpetuating the exact same damage to the exact same people, and to the free societies they allege to be defending. The only difference is that one set out to intentionally trivialize the Holocaust, while the other trivializes the Holocaust by default via their own self-centered reactivity and minimization of their alleged opposition. Most of whom, I can't emphasize enough, couldn't care less how ANY of this makes Jewish Americans. The same people who call everything a \"Holocaust\" or  \"concentration camp\" without even thinking or caring about the dire repercussions they're well aware of. There's a reason Jewish people don't ever use these terms outside of discussing the actual Holocaust. I miss the days when I rarely ever had to use the term \"Antisemitic,\" because that word is reserved for the people who want us dead, not just idiots who bully us for \"killing Jesus,\" or no longer want anything to do with us when they find out we're Jews. I shouldn't have to face the severe level of hate that I do now, but that's reality. I feel most betrayed by the silence of now *former*-allies who arbitrarily decided Jews aren't marginalized enough for our suffering to matter anymore, the minimization that comes not from my enemies or hate groups \u2014 but from so-called Leftists & my own friends; and the torment and anguish this has forced upon me & everyone I love. \n\nI'm disappointed in the societal normalization of this hypocritical hyperbole that simultaneously tells Jews to \"get over it,\" while calling Neo-Nazis out for everything BUT their Antisemitism, which is *truly* ironic (correct usage of the word), and instead of trying to understand the context for what's really going down by listening to those being directly targeted, they opt to blanket minimize the threat these hate groups pose!! Of course non-minorities aren't worried \u2014 they're not being targeted.\n\nThis isn't about masks, or being \"free\" to spread COVID at Applebees \u2014 this is straight-up **Holocaust Denial** propaganda. Nothing more, nothing less. To say different is to agree with their logical fallacy that: Holocaust = being forced to wear yellow Stars of David & nothing else.",

Nobody has to read anything I write, however, if you don't read, don't reply. \n\n>I don't feel attacked at all -- I'm an ethnic Jew and most of my extended family was killed in the Holocaust -- nor did I downvote you.\n\nYour reply was defensive and dismissive. People who react like that, do so because they chose to take something personally and feel attacked. \n\nAnd what do you mean by \"ethnic Jew?\" Please explain why you identify as a Jew in ethnicity only. Usually when I hear this, it's because someone has a Jewish parent, but was raised a different religion, or they're claiming a Jewish grandparent makes them Jewish. Not tryna make assumptions, but I've only heard that term used in these contexts. Clarity needed. \n\nWe also *never* define ourselves by family lost in the Holocaust. My grandfather shot top Nazi SS Officers point blank in between the eyes, after telling them he was a Jew, and before that, he & his comrades celebrated Passover in Berlin in 1943 as an American Jewish OSS Soldier, aka a Ritchie Boy, under Patton. He put an \"H\" on his dog tag for \"Hebrew,\" while most Jewish soldiers put \"P\" for \"Protestant\" in case they were captured. He fought in Battle of the Bulge & D-Day, and one wrong move would've gotten him in a concentration camp instead of a POW camp because he refused to hide who he was. He physically returned from that war, but psychologically he was a casualty. I lost dozens of family members to the Pale Settlement, and God only knows what my Great Great Grandfather survived before he emigrated from Egypt without any family. He refused to ever speak on it... And back then, nobody asked, because being an Egyptian Jew was taboo, directly tying our lineage to slavery. \n\nI'm Jewish. Period. Half-Jews are Jews as well, *unless* they were raised practicing a different religion. However, they should at least know the fundamentals of Judaism before identifying as such, namely on social media, because non-Jews treat every Jew as an authority on Judaism, and those who know nothing of the religion are frequently tricked into co-signing on disinfo. Practicing or not, Jews are Jewish unless they convert to another religion. It's not a religion of strict or controlling doctrine. We're free to question God's existence, or not believe, because that's the reality of surviving genocide after genocide: Where was God? The hard line in the sand is: no multiple Gods, no Jesus, no idoltry. Pretty damn simple. Meaning, no Jew has to do *anything* to be Jewish. Jews know this, hence why \"ethnic Jew\" is not in our vocabulary. We don't separate our cultural identity. We're a religious-ethnic group.",

But it can also be a liability in terms of lugging extra weight around, and of course the cost. If you have to choose between a decent set of plates and ammunition for training, ammo and range time is going to be a better investment 9 out of 10 times.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk from people who think they\u2019re going to be a freedom fighter or something. Maybe that\u2019s true for some, if we ever get to that point. Insurgencies are fed by regular people pushed to the brink, after all. But for the vast majority of gun owners (including leftists) if you get into a firefight, you fucked up bad. Your main goal should be to flee as quickly as possible to save your life. Body armor may impede this rather than help.\n\nLong story short, body armor is useful, but it\u2019s not a cure-all and is not the most important part of your kit.\n\nComing from a guy with guns and a set of plates, just in case.",

Democrats make up at least a pseudo-majority over all. That said, unifying the country and purging the GOP will take decades of brutal conflict. Most likely not civil war or all-out armed conflict but there will be plenty of casualties from political violence. \n\nThis country is falling behind so rapidly that I don\u2019t know if I can stomach life here. I feel extremely selfish but I also struggle with knowing that life is short the desire to not have my kids grow up in what appears to be a country potentially with several consecutive lost generations.",
