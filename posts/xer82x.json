And nor was it taken seriously in court. And it was voluntarily withdrawn, which is why no judgement in court was ever made.\n\nSo let's look a bit further. Thanks for the Wikipedia article, did you know that this claim was not included in it? Is that because it's not serious or noteworthy?\n\nLet's see, a quick Google for anything like a fact check, first link is a Vox article about it... And I am further not convinced.
