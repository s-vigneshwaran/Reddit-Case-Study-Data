We believe we are the same Church restored.\n\nI understand and can respect that some may disagree. To those people I invite them to read what we believe and even compare it to The Bible and then pray to know if it is true or not.\n\nUnlink many religions we do not tell people to believe what we do. We invite them to read and pray asking The Holy Spirit and find out for themselves if it is true or not. We will also not put down other religions. We greatly respect someone right to believe and worship as they think is right. The process of seeking truth and doing our best to worship God is wonderful.",

It is physically impossible. Conversion is something that happens between them and God. It is a very personal journey. \n\nSo why send missionaries and have ads right? That would be a logical question. Well what is the best thing you ever ate in your entire life? Would you keep that a secret and tell nobody about that awesome tasking food and that experience you had that shaped your culinary world? Maybe you would I can not say. However I believe you would understand how someone might want to share such an amazing experience and invite others to try it. That is much like sharing our faith.

The Bill of Rights used to be seen as a quasi-religious creed in virtually all of \nAmerican culture.\n\nThere also was never an idea that the second amendment only referred to for militias. First off, it was never enforced or interpret that way when it was written. Second, the rough draft of the second amendment clearly states a difference between the militia and the right to bear arms. Third, it would be the stupidest provision ever. So you have to be in a militia, or a public paramilitary uprising, a terrorist organization to own guns. But if you're Joe Schmoe in the Louisiana swamps you can't carry a shotgun to kill wild boar. So where are these arms even coming from to begin with if the general public can't sell them? They'd have to register with the government to differentiate themselves from Joe Schmoe as a paramilitary terrorist organization to obtain guns?\n\nThe whole idea, \"It's only for militias!\" Is the dumbest take ever.\n\nAll that being said, if you want to make the argument that the world has changed in 250 years and we need to rethink the second amendment, go for it. That's a valid argument you can make, but god, it's so painful to read these half thought out ridiculously bias memes that are just complete bullshit.\n\nJust make some coherent fucking arguments and then normal people can start supporting it. Stop appealing to the fringes of society who can't follow more than a sentence or two without dozing off. Stop appealing to the 5 minutes of hate crowd. Alright, well, there ya go.",

The government has an obligation to provide them. \n\nHowever clearly there are places on earth where the citizens are not allowed to exercise their right to speech or life.

Try comprehending when you read. \n\nCorrect, We have the right to shit. We collectively agree not to shit everywhere, as sometimes we collectively CHOOSE not to exercise certain rights in order to have a better functioning society, but some people have no other option and shit in the woods, and that\u2019s their right. You can\u2019t stop someone from shitting after all if you have to go you have to go. As long as you aren\u2019t shitting on someone else\u2019s stuff, which would be depriving them of their right to their stuff, then what is wrong with shitting anywhere else? We use bathrooms because they are better than shitting in the grass, but not because we don\u2019t have a natural right to shit in the grass. Shitting in the street is illegal because that street is someone else\u2019s stuff, so shitting there is depriving them use of it. Completely consistent with my natural rights criteria. \n\nAnd yes why shouldn\u2019t you be able to get as high as you want? That infringes on nobody else\u2019s rights.\n\nThe argument against abortion is that you are killing another person, this violating their right to life. Not as cut and dry as you try to make it sound natural rights wise as my definition says it can\u2019t infringe anyone else\u2019s natural rights. \n\nSo how is what I said crazy again? Do you believe we don\u2019t have the rights you mentioned? Nothing I said is logically inconsistent yet you claim it\u2019s \u201cnon logic\u201d. Try harder to come up with a coherent argument. The ones you just tried completely fail to accomplish what you wanted to argue when you apply critical thinking. \n\nPlease do go on and on, I\u2019d love a real example of something that doesn\u2019t fit my criteria, but so far you\u2019ve failed to provide even one.",

Those who oppose that view disagree that the fetus has no rights until viability. \n\nAlso abortion is a great example of conflicting rights. Let\u2019s say a fetus was a full blown legal human with all the rights that come with that. Well yes that human is infringing the mothers right to their body and nutrients, it is acting as a parasite. For these reason I do believe abortion is a right even if a fetus is a person. If another person was consuming me for subsistence then yes I have the right to remove that persons access to me, and if that means they die then so be it.",

I guess a 2000 year old book is up to interpretation though.  \n\n\nI also find the correlation of christians and conservatives strange, as where I live most chirstians and catholics are liberal or very left wing especially in social aspects.  Like I went to a catholic highschool (I personally am atheist though) and in our \"catholic studies\" class we were taught to accept peoples for their differences, value other religions and their beliefs, and taught about social injustices in modern society (racism, homophobia, the whole gist of it).  The catholics I know are pro gun regulation and such, it's very strange to hear there are people who claim to be christian yet don't follow their own book.\n\n\nEdit: Also, one of the ten commandments is \"Don't use the lords name in vain\", I get the common interpretation is don't swear and say things like \"oh my god\".  But I was taught it means to not use god to legitimize your beliefs or actions, essentially don't twist his word to fit you.  So for things like \"God would want us to fight this war\" or things like this tweet would go against that.",

If you claim to be christian and they claim to be christian, y'all need to settle your differences and agree on facts and intents. Otherwise, the loudest ones get the most attention and represent that religion. The court of public opinion will judge based on the loudest, most visible portion of the belief. Right now, the crazies are representing christianity. So all christians are zealots, fanatics, and insane. Until the crazies are dealt with, that's how it will be.\n\n>To undo what has been done to this country by the GOP and their adoption of the Evangelicals is so huge that I do not think it can be done.  I think our best chance is to keep them as the minority, never let them take power, and deal with elitist kleptocrat/plutocrats aka the Democrats.\n\nIf the Constitutional intent of separation of church and state was actually enforced, this mess wouldn't be happening.",

Looking at the historical context, where 911 and first responders do not exist, there is a need to take up arms to defend your home because outside help will likely never come. In general, that's not the world we live in today. Also, those verses quoted are more often interpreted to mean spiritual conflicts rather than the physical. Like when Paul talked about wearing the armor of God and doing battle, those are spiritual armors and spiritual battles. \n\nMoreover, in the context of this original post, having a gun is NOT a God given right. Even if I concede to the \"defend yourself with violence\" doctrine, which I don't, it is only in the US where guns are so prevalent that it becomes an arms race that everyone needs a gun. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I own a pistol and a shotgun for home defense. But I never for a second think owning guns is a God given right. In fact, I wish I lived in a country where guns were illegal. I'd honestly feel much safer there.",

I remember reading about someone who lived in Westboro area, he worked in animal rescue, he didn't associate with the church. He made a complaint against a church member, and someone trapping a kitten in a hole on the blokes property, and poured concrete on the kitten. Obviously the police did sweet FA. Thankfully the kitten survived, but speaking out against people like that, when the local society is filled with churchgoers, just isn't possible. Its terrifying.",

Our ability to arm ourselves and protect ourselves from that government is fundamentally important to the existence and preservation of what was at the time the first free and egalitarian society. Just like our right to a free press, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, the right to bear arms holds our government accountable and prevents them from becoming tyrannical and taking those rights away.   \n\n\nThe debate on guns being unsafe and the need to take them away, while it could be totally true, WILL take away a fundamental freedom that acts as a barrier from government overreach and preserves our free society.",

For example, when they use the term \u201csemi-auto\u201d, they don\u2019t seem to understand that not all firearms of that description are military inspired.  That\u2019s a whole lot of wiggle room for people we don\u2019t trust to play with.  And that\u2019s just the example that first comes to mind.\n\n2)  You are right, any law or piece of legislation that restricts what once was legal to own, is an infringement on an individual\u2019s rights.  Ending slavery was a huge win, prohibition a failure.  No sane individual wants this carnage to continue, but a firearm of any type in the hands of a responsible owner is not a threat.  Yes, there would be a lot of strife.  Perhaps grandfathering those in circulation could be considered.\n\nI\u2019m going to lose some friends over this.

You have to pass the NICS background check which the store employee calls in.  The employee reads the information and answers you\u2019ve submitted to the call center agent who actually runs the check.  At which time he gives the store employee one of three answers: proceed with the sale, delay (something doesn\u2019t quite add up and requires investigation), or denied (there\u2019s some stuff you must\u2019ve forgotten about).\n\nAnd yes, these same measures are required for purchases at gun shows when a licensed dealer is involved.  I have never found this to be intrusive or inconvenient, and neither have most people I\u2019ve talked with.  \n\nThe steps that would have to be taken to have a background check on every purchase, even relative to relative, would not be very different.  Seller and purchaser go to a local gun shop and explain that it\u2019s a private party sale.  GS logs the gun in, the purchaser fills out his 4473 form and GS calls it in.  NICS gives the green light, purchaser pays the GS a service fee, and it\u2019s all nice and tidy.  Service fee is usually about $15-25.  If you don\u2019t have that much to spare, you don\u2019t need to be buying a new gun.\n\nMost people are going to have a problem raising the legal age to 21 across the board for purchase.  They\u2019ll point to the fact that military personnel under 21 are issued real weapons of war.",

Once regulatory powers are devolved from Congress to an agency (as they routinely are) it becomes much quicker to expand or simply alter official interpretations to fundamentally change the impact of regulations.  For a simple example, look at the massive impact of the ATF interpretation of brace vs stock that led to an entire industry based around selling AR \u201cpistols\u201d that are ultimately just SBRs by another name. Now hand them a far larger and inevitably more complex series of gun regulations to interpret and apply.  \n\n2. The people most opposed to gun ownership know the least about guns.  They routinely pretend AR15s are somehow fundamentally different than the same semi auto rifles we\u2019ve had on the civilian market for the last century, and think that anything plastic is a machine gun straight out of a marine armory. Trusting them to regulate guns responsibly is like trusting the westboro Baptist church to arrange military funerals.\n\n3.

My former home city of NYC banned guns completely in its entirety, yet criminals get them ANYWAY, despite the laws. In other words, laws don't do jack shit but make the problem worse.\n\nLastly, Uvalde was a perfect example of what happens when only the police are allowed to have guns; they cower in fear and arrest those willing to save their children while the innocent get slaughtered (oh yes, those cops pepper sprayed and arrested parents who tried to break in to save the kids).",

I would imagine any of these lines can be interpreted very differently depending on the translation used. \n\nIsiah 49: 24-26\nExodus 22:2\nLuke 11:21 \nLuke 22:35\n\nBut it also discusses the need to avoid responding to evil acts with evil, but instead with blessings, forgiveness, and turning the other cheek. \n\nI think a certain level of discernment is needed in any specific situation.\n\nBut what is the alternative to self-defense when you are attacked? If self-ownership is not a right, then what is?\nI couldn't imagine being attacked, or watching my family be attacked, by someone, and feeling powerless to do anything about it - or worse yet, feeling like I would be punished for trying to protect myself or my loved ones. It is worse yet when it is not just one individual (evil, misguided, misunderstood or otherwise) but a whole system that exploits us through violence. \n\nWe are so lucky to live in parts of the country where we have the liberty to discuss our rights, our thoughts, and even religious texts openly.

Of course the government has overstepped it's lawful authority and infringed on a number of those rights, but the beauty of our constitution and legal foundation is that any overreach is not legally binding as our rights cannot be modified or reduced. \n\nThat said, the government will lock you in jail and shoot your dog if you disobey their infringements.\n\nEdit: I challenge anyone to refute the points I made above. I expected to be down voted, but I'm right, and everyone will see that when not one of you can prove me incorrect. Have a blessed day ya'll ;)",

The servant\u2019s name was Malchus. So Jesus said to Peter, \u2018Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBeat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong\u201d (Joel 3:10).\n\n\u201cThey all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night\u201d (Song of Solomon 3:8).\n\n\u201cMoses spoke to the people saying, \u2018Arm some of yourselves for the war, and let them go against the Midianites to take vengeance for the Lord on Midian\u2019\u201d (Numbers 31:3).\n\n\u201che that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one\u201d (Luke 22:36).",

You've now realised the point: you can cherry pick shit from the bible and claim that it says whatever you like, which is exactly what you've done. \n\nMatthew 26:52 has been interpreted as an exhortation to pacifism. It (and the passages from elsewhere regarding the arrest of Jesus) have also been interpreted as an argument only against violence in this specific moment. This is because the bible is frequently vague and contradictory, which allows people to project their own beliefs onto it and claim that those beliefs are justified by it. \n\nThe bible simply does not have a clear passage indicating that the right to bear arms is \"granted by God to all Americans as an American birthright\". Your attempts to find one were not successful.",

Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.

I also agree with the NRA when they say \"Outlaw guns, and only outlaws will have guns.\" People who do not care about laws that prohibit murder, probably don't care too much about a law that says you can't have a gun. And most guns used to commit crimes, were bought illegally",

Natural rights were a core idea in the Enlightenment: that wasn\u2019t the King who conferred them on his subjects, but that everyone had certain rights and privileges based *solely on the fact that they are alive*. \n\nThe Declaration is built upon this new idea on the purpose of a government. It\u2019s not a functionary of the monarch divine right to rule over people. Rather the government exists only to protect these natural rights, and only derives its authority to do so from the consent of the governed. If you read the Bill of Rights you\u2019ll see that it doesn\u2019t actually grant rights like freedom of speech or religion or the right to bear arms. It assumes the pre-existence of those rights, and limits the government\u2019s power to pass laws which infringe upon them. Ask any lawyer, judge,  or constitutional scholar how different the subsequent 250 years of American jurisprudence would look if the Constitution was written in a way that implies the rights were given to the people by the government. Slaw that says \u201cCongress grants the People the Freedom of Religion\u201d is a totally different statement than \u201cCongreve shall make no Law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\u201d.",

They believe the right to bear arms is a Natural Right. I tend to agree, but using a God or diety in the argument leaves a nasty taste in my mouth.",

Especially in the case of the 2nd Amendment, historical parlance is also important as well. I still see people making jabs about militias and a gross misunderstanding of the word \"regulated\". \n\nI have spent decades casually learning about our government and it's framework-- and the mindset behind the people who founded it, and I feel like I only have a very basic and passive understanding of it all. By scrolling social media in 2022 you would think that we would be living in paradise if only those nasty obstructionist republicans didn't keep ruining everything. \n\nEvery hot ticket issue from abortion (I am very pro choice) to gun rights (I am pro 2A) to immigration (I am very pro immigration) to workers rights (Unionize everything, yesterday) has a good argument on the other side. Being able to honestly consider an opposing view, or even having a little cognitive dissonance here and there is the mark of a carefully considered and critical thought.\n \nI'm not sure how I got off on this tirade, but all I want to say is to be critical of your views, consider things from both sides, and delve into the history of why things are the way they are-- don't fall into the trap of one-liner gotchas and groupthink like this twitter screencap does.",

It's the perfect start to understanding concepts like Natural Law and social contracts, and ultimately the Declaration of Independence, The Articles of Confederation, and the Constitution. \n\nYou may not believe in Natural Law, but that concept is the foundation for the entire concept of human rights. Essentially every western democracy has it's roots in the concepts of Natural Law. \n\nJust because a right had to be fought for does not mean that it did not exist in the first place. For example I believe that we have the natural right to life, liberty, and property. Even though slavery existed and we had to fight to abolish it does not mean that the right to be free never existed in the first place. Freedom from slavery is something that pre-dated the existence of a government but was usurped along the way.\n\nNatural law is an interesting philosophical dance between laws and ethics and I think you might find it interesting!",

You even cemented my point by illustrating that the rights were fought for and earned.\n\nThe fact that countries around the world have different perceptions of human rights should be enough to show that they don't just exist but instead are agreed upon then granted.\n\nNow, if you want to redefine human rights as something else then I'm happy to discuss your definition of them. But if we go with the most widely accepted definitions, they clearly cannot exist.\n\nKeep in mind I'm not condemning the idea of them. I quite like the idea and would love for it to be true, I even live my life as thought it were. But I don't believe they exist as some sort of, for lack of a better term, \"divine mandate\". \n\nAnd yes I *completely* agree with you that the topic is fascinating and everyone should study it!",

You know that thing they did to give everyone the right to vote?\n\nGo ahead and pass an amendment repealing the 2nd. Until then, you\u2019re  just spouting impotent rage. \n\nAnd for the record , I think Jefferson was a pretentious prick.

Remember that we're not trying to save hundreds of lives...we're trying to save MILLIONS of lives (possibly billions). Right now, American hubris is a big part of that equation.

The last time the second amendment actually could have come in to play was the September 11th terror attacks. Since then it's literally unconstitutional to own a gun.\n\nThe second amendment is not about owning or not owning a gun, nor is it about government intervention. It's allowing gun ownership if democracy is threatened. Otherwise, legislation can restrict gun use.",

But issues like this are talked about year after year and decade after decade.\n\nAs an older person you actually live through things. You collect ideas and even wisdom after a point.\n\nSometimes the local or global news is like watching a horror movie. You see Australians, for example, cheerfully handing in their weapons. You\u2014the moviegoer\u2014hear the scary background music but the characters in the movie don't. Being older, you know that this can't come to any good. You can't jump into the movie and help those people.\n\nBelieve it or not, I knew a temporary Swede. He was a young German boy who fled to Sweden for the duration of WWII. He and I worked together at Ramstein in the same Teletype shop. I'm sure even he would tell you that I'm telling you the truth, that there's little that we can do to help Australia right now.",

If enough people with actual power (money and propaganda) want something to change, you wouldn't be able to do a single thing to stop it. \n\nThe only people you scare are your neighbors and those that see your lifted truck with 16 American flags on it, many of which are defiled bastardizations with blue lines and Trump's face. But they don't fear you because they respect you, like your broken mind has convinced you. They fear you because you're clearly unhinged and would probably shoot a black mail man for trespassing on your property.",

What you need is the murder rate.  Not even the homicide rate - homicide can include police shootings, accidental, and self defense.  Look for \"murder.\"",

But again, you ignore the point here and quibble over detail. Even if they were all staunch, dyed in the wool catholics, if they had intended our nation to be associated with Christ and the mores and unique mien of one particular God, that would have been abundantly clear on a reading of our constitution, our bill of rights, our declaration of independence, etc. If we were meant to be a nation of Christian laws and underpinnings, it would be laced into the fabric of those very key, absolutely fucking key documents.

But I think I begin to understand why you so desperately need your guns.\n\nAll we're trying to get done here is the institution of some reasonable oversight--the equivilant of which we all take for granted everyday when it's time to assume the responsibilities of something so banal as car ownership--for purchasing a tool that can easily end dozens of people's lives in moments. It's that simple. Can we please just try to reduce the number of children murdered this year by a bit by inserting some mild paperwork between impulse and action?",

You want to restrict my rights based on what a handful of people are doing? Fine. Place restrictions on swimming pools, cigarettes, alcohol. All of those kill more children each year than any guns do, but no one seems to care.\n\nI have empathy for the families who lost loved ones and children. That is heartbreaking. I hope these sickos get the maximum pentaly possible. But I don't see why rights have to be infringed on. \n\nHere is a thought. Why don't we either arm teachers that are willing, or set military personel outside of schools? Do I want that to happen? No. But criminals don't follow laws. So making more laws and thibking it will keep kids and adults who need more mental help isn't going to help.",

Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.\u201d\n\n38:The disciples said, \u201cSee, Lord, here are two swords.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough!\u201d he replied.\"\n\n\nWhy have you conflated the garden, from which man was removed, with all of creation? Why have you conflated the defense of a divine paradise with that of a man-constructed concept like nation? Why aren't you buying swords? Why aren't you also showing any restraint? Wouldn't that instruct us to only arm 1/6 of the population with a single sword each? Do you have any respect for your own faith or do you just strangle the words of God to fit whatever you like at the moment?",

I dont have a 'chapter and verse' but Im sure a very simple and easy google would fix that.\n\nPersonally I feel that outside of discussions around the afterlife and Salvation, it's a folly to attempt to debate social issues using the Bible to people who dont believe it. Best to just stick to the reality of the fact that we have a Constitutional Amendment that, for now, is the law of the land.\n\nThe Bible also says that we are to obey the law unless the law runs in direct conflict to The Bible. If Congress were to modify the Constitution so that we can't have certain kinds of rifles, so be it - it's not a Crisis of Faith.",

They hurt WAY more people than they save, I'd rather go for a safer solution.\n\nIt would take things like effort and assumed responsibility, things too many people here aren't that into.\n\nI find it a bit simple and sophomoric to think \"They have deadly weapons! I should have deadly weapons!\" I mean, you can justify your way into owning a nuclear bomb with that logic. \"They are doing something that puts a lot of people in danger! I'm going to do something that puts people in danger because, you never know, I could be one of those people in danger. I don't care if everyone else is in danger, I only care that I don't feel like I'm in danger. I'm worth the risk.\"\n\nI really want to give people more credit than that, and say, \"You know, we've learned a lot over the last couple hundred years. If we just took that knowledge and applied it to our society, with a little effort and discipline we could solve these problems.\n\nBut I'm constantly reminded that, no, we don't deserve credit we haven't earned, and while we have gained knowledge, we've chosen to ignore it for the familiarity and safety of our own personal delusions.\n\nThe human race has shown its limitations. Our best is behind us. We're just living through the downfall, and drinking margaritas on the way.\n\nI constantly want to believe we can be better than that.\n\nWe've proven that we can't.",

To the point where he prefferred to be put on a cross than fight with violence. If the Bible is to be believed, he was a peaceful and forgiving man. And that's why it always baffles me when I see the amount of Christians that are so pro 2nd amendment, (not saying the 2nd amendment shouldn't exist under certain regulation - training, routine psychological evaluations, etc. - but that regulation certainly doesn't exist in the U.S at the moment, and these people don't seem to have much desire for it), let alone say bs like this.",

That research exposed what religion really is, I was quite shocked to find evidence based answers to questions so many people think are unanswerable.

Religion is a relic of the past, and that's where it belongs.\n\nIt's so sad we've carried it this far, and we will continue to carry it to our doom.\n\nBut while that's the case, I'm desperate to figure out at exactly what moment in thought you surrender reason and jump to faith.

But the military also sucks because we pointlessly invade other countries for profit.\"\n\nYeah, I know what you're talking about, but that doesn't refute my big-picture points regarding the benefits of having an armed populace. I agree that the military is misused with stupid invasions that are ultimately geared towards financial incentives. That's not relevant to having civilian arms at home though.\n\n\"Okay you're out of touch with reality and just bringing out non-sequiturs like this.\"\n\nThose are verifiable differences which completely change the game...not non-sequiturs\n\n\"We're awful in terms of that, so no. Republicans need to stop banning things and expanding the military and calling for dumb shit like that. America sucks compared to other developed nations where we lock people up for profit and people live on the streets because we give half of our wealth to a select few. Is that freedom to you?\"\n\nWe could definitely make greater strides towards a more free society (end consensual crime, protect reasonable abortion provisions, inact prison reform, etc.), but all in all, we're doing waaaayyy better than most. The left is just as guilty, by the way, especially in recent years. \n\nAlso, we don't \"give our wealth to a select few.\" I think you could make the argument that big-box stores, globalization, Covid mandates, and other factors have really hurt small businesses, but that's the nature of the beast that is Capitalism. Tax structures are a totally different monster and make up a much larger debate. \n\n\"But yes we should air on the side of libertarianism as opposed to authoritarianism. I only hear \"small government\" as an excuse to skew wealth to the rich and cut welfare, but i'm still for that in theory. But that's irrelevant.\"\n\nAgree, but I think a safety net should be in place.",

The constitution codified into law the existence of a handful of those rights and iirc the 10th acts as a catch all. The Second ammendment guarantees the right of the people to keep and bear arms. There were a few reasons for this to be included some are relevant to today others are not. There's defense against foreign or domestic threats, which is fairly irrelevant as the government hasn't really done the whole militia thing since the 19th century then there's the kinda sticky one, overthrowing the government should that government lose the consent of the people to govern, ie, in the eyes of the people they become tyrannical. In a way it's meant to be an unofficial check and balance, should all other checks and balances fail. That was the Intention of the framers and thus a case against the banning of pretty much any weapons that the government chooses to have for itself. Don't like that, then you need to advocate for the appeal of the Second ammendment, but do you trust the government enough to give up that right in exchange for a little bit of security? A government that may very well one day have Trump, or someone like him, at the helm again.",

In fact, the Constitution is antithetical to Christianity and the Bible.\n\nThe First Amendment of the Constitution states, \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\" yet the Bible, by the laws written therein, prohibits the exercise of any religion but that which serves Yahveh, whom the Bible declares to be the only true god.\n\nFor example, Exo. 20:3, 20:5,\n\n3 You shall have no other gods before Me... 5 you shall not bow down to them nor serve them.\n\nIdolatry (worship of another god besides Yahveh) is punishable by death in the Bible. On the other hand, the Constitution via the First Amendment permits Americans to freely worship any god, or even no god at all, without threat of punishment.\n\nTherefore, we must ask, why would this Christian god, who supposedly grants Americans the right to bear arms, also grant the same Americans the right to worship another god even though the Christian god prohibits them from doing so in the Christian god's word (the Bible)?

Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.",

You can use any terminology you want but that's not a wrong interpretation. \n\n\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\u201d\n\nThomas Jefferson, Declaration of independence. \n\n\"Upon this law, depend the natural rights of mankind: the Supreme Being gave existence to man, together with the means of preserving and beatifying that existence. He endowed him with rational faculties, by the help of which, to discern and pursue such things, as were consistent with his duty and interest, and invested him with an inviolable right to personal liberty, and personal safety\u2026The Sacred Rights of Mankind are not to be rummaged for, among old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as with a sun beam, in the whole volume of human nature, by the Hand of the Divinity itself; and can never be erased or obscured by mortal power.\"\n\nAlexander Hamilton, The farmer Refuted. \n\n\n\nI can keep quoting them but it would be redundant, they believed all explicit rights were from an outside power. Jefferson even said it applies to any God or the infidel. \n\nSo you can rag on this guy all you want but God given rights were literally the basis of this country. It's how it was seen from day 1 of this country. \n\nJohn Locke makes similar arguments about rights and, of course, that's also a very significant thinker during the revolutionary period.",

And that translation is SUPPOSE to read as \u201ca man shall not sleep with a CHILD as he would lay with a woman.\u201d\n\nAnd more to that, I don\u2019t believe we should be looking at the Bible to justify laws and such for everyone. First, religious freedom for all. If that\u2019s your rules for yourself, fine. Having gay marriage be legal doesn\u2019t force you to be gay or be married to a gay man. But having it illegal to enforce your religious beliefs forces other to go against their own beliefs, both moral and religious. \n\nAnd it also doesn\u2019t help that there are LARGE sections from the Bible that almost everyone from the Bible doesn\u2019t follow. Such as not wearing clothes made from two types of threads. Not planting crops of two different types side by side. Not eating shellfish. Stoning people to death for working on the Sunday. Selling their daughters into slavery. The logistics of buying and selling slaves in general. \n\nI\u2019m not here to rag and I\u2019m sorry if it comes off like that.",

Even toddlers manage to pull the trigger. Turning a sword into an offensive weapon, however? Takes practice. \n\nYou can't shoot like an olympian, but you don't need to. They are designed to be as simple to use as possible. You point it where you want the bullet to go, you pull the trigger, and you got a fair chance of hitting something, if you're close enough.\n\nHold up a sword in combat and if you aren't trained it'll be out of your hands, with you impaled on it, before you have a chance to say, \"Oops.\"\n\nI just think there's a lot of assuming about what Jesus would do, when he has already spoken for himself.

Common sense says that it's very likely Jesus never said that. Books that contain the truth don't use parables, they use evidence, and data. Their goal is to help the reader understand, not leave them guessing with their eternal soul on the line, lol.\n\nI've been told this parable thing before. But then I've also been told that it needs to be taken literally, these are the words of god, not open to human interpretation, but decreed to us from up on high.\n\nWhen I ask a literalist about people who don't take it literally, they tell me that those people are just bad christians.\n\nWhen I ask a non-literalist about people who do take it literally, they tell me those people are just bad christians.\n\nBoth sides have equal authority to make this claim, so I'm trying to figure out where all the confidence is coming from that you understand the Bible correctly?",

They're all Christian.\nThat's not coincidence, that's by design.\n\nI'm here to try and understand at what point you decided to stop thinking, and turned to faith. That's what I want to know. \n\nI once was faithful, I've outgrown it. I'm endlessly curious why others haven't.\n\nI only tried to argue with the arguments I've heard to see what your responses would be. Would you do what most Christians do and just assume that you're a better Christian than I was pretending to be?\n\nAnd, yeah, you kinda did. I'm interested in patterns of behavior.

You have to build up the courage to face that fear, learn the truth, reestablish your understanding of reality, and put a premium on using critical thinking skills in the future to determine fact from fiction.\n\nYou are indoctrinated, no church is necessary. When your brain was still forming, it was given false information about how the universe works. It used that false information as a foundation to build your understanding of reality. Misinformation indoctrinates you, not church's.\n\nThe main thing that separates us from our Chimpanzee cousins is our natural curiosity. Our ability and desire to know what's happening around us. God is the ultimate placeholder in the absence of accurate data. When man first saw lightning, it was because of the Gods, when humankind experienced earthquakes, volcanos, plague, all of it was attributed to God. Until we learned more about it. Now we know that lightning doesn't come from God. We understand major disasters, and what causes them. God didn't send us polio. God isn't telling people to shoot up schools. All of that is explained by science, now.  There's no need for a God to have involved themselves in any of it. Their supernatural power wasn't necessary.\n\nYou can choose to learn more about the nature of the Fibonacci Sequence, or the Golden Ratio, and eventually the mystery of it won't lead you to Gods, it'll engage you in critical thought, and unlock the natural beauty of the universe. You just have to learn to not accept \"...'cause God did it.\" as an answer. It has been used as answer for everything we don't understand, and after research and study, it has never held up.\n\nThis is how you can break through your indoctrination. By constantly questioning what you think you know, and making a dedicated effort to finding the most up-to-date and accurate information we have available.",

I grew up with a personality disorder, my entire view on reality was skewed due to mental illness. I was forced to learn what's real in order to get myself out of it.\n\nI don't know this information because I think I'm better than you. I know this information because I was forced to learn it. You likely know and can do tons of shit that would be very difficult for me to replicate.\n\nWhen it comes to the brain, how it works, what it does with information, how it affects your behavior, what's subconsciously keeping you in the mental state you're in, all that kind of stuff, I had to learn. And all I mean to do is share it because I've had more time to sit, think, and read than most anyone else, outside of monks. I've had a lot of downtime while others are busy with life. It's given me a unique perspective, and it could be used to help people, if they'd be willing to listen.\n\nAs long as you continue arguing, I will continue to reply, because I've asked all the same questions you want to ask. I understand that people come to different conclusions, what I don't understand is how scientists put hundred's, if not thousands, of hours of work into coming to a conclusion that can be replicated by anyone doing the same experiments. It's got logic, data, and trained expertise behind it. Then you, or another religious person, comes around and says, \"Well, I came to a different conclusion.\" after spending 5 seconds considering it. \n\nYour conclusions don't command any respect because you haven't put forth the required effort to discover one.\n\nThat's you, and these religous people, hiding from the responsibility and accountability of discovering the truth. You think that your guess is equivalent to their knowledge. That's an issue with your ego, not an issue with science.\n\n>Most sciences believe it or not are still religious.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna need to see some evidence of that. My studying has shown religious scientists to be rare. They exist, but they are far from the majority. Religion has been exposed as a lie for a *long long* time. You can be a scientist and be religous, but you can't bring your religion into your science and expect to get any useful data out of it. Science is a secular study.\n\nI absolutely do hate religion, but I certainly do have a reason to. It poisons the mind. It indoctrinates our youth. It puts the mind in a prison it doesn't recognize. It abuses people, uses people, lies to people, and steals from people. I have every reason in the world to hate religion, it itself is a force of hate, prejudice, and discrimination all over the world.\n\nI'm comfortable with my level of maturity. I don't believe in invisible ghosts floating in the sky, ordering our lives around like a supernatural game of The Sims. Gods, monsters, and magic belong to the immature. The people who still hold on to what they knew when they were 2. The people who would rather bitch, moan, and complain than read, and educate themselves.\n\nThat's all I'm asking you to do, is read. You don't have to take my word on anything I've said, I'm confident that if you look, you'll easily come across the same information that I did, the truth isn't hidden, it just takes effort to discover. Effort you'd rather put in to insulting me. \n\nDoes that sound like maturity to you?",

I don't think you're an idiot. This isn't a question of intelligence, unless your IQ is below average, which I don't assume it to be.\n\nYou are more of a victim than you are to blame. You're only acting as you feel is right. What I'm trying to tell you is that there are things that you do not know. And if you ever decide to stop fighting me, and just listen to me, or seek out the knowledge I'm discussing, you can fill in those gaps of information. All it does is make you better prepared to face the future.\n\n>If everyone reads the same stuff\n\nNothing against you, but I'm so sick and tired of hearing this argument from you guys. Always with the *extremes*. I'm not asking everyone to read the same stuff. Read anything and everything you like, but when you go in search of the truth, look deeper than an article, or a book. Read the research, see where the people giving the information are getting their information from, vet sources, see what others say about the research, leave no stone unturned. We have so many answers to so many questions, it's unbelievable how much knowledge we've gained over the years. And still that is only the tiniest sliver of the smallest percentage you can think of when it comes to how much there is yet to learn.\n\nArm yourself with accurate information as opposed to personal feelings.\n\nBe as different as you want to be. I've been different my whole life, and it has really pissed some people off. Can't help it. I don't care about being different. I care about doing the right thing. I don't care how you get it done, I just care that you at least try. Help others by ridding yourself of your natural prejudices. Use the information others have suffered greatly to gather, and try to do better, constantly.\n\nBecome a citizen of the planet who takes responsibility for helping out where you can. Try to be of service to the greater cause. Recognize that there's more going on here than you, and your life, and your thoughts, and your feelings.\n\nChristianity is responsible for the oppression of minorities for centuries. Black people, brown people, women, homosexuals, the Bible has been, and still is, used to justify oppression all over the world.\n\nSurely I don't need to explain to you how the Quran has been dangerous, yeah? If you understand that, just take that finger you're pointing at Muslims and point it back at yourself, and maybe it'll make more sense.\n\nReligion made sense when we didn't know any better. It was still a tool of misinformation, oppression, and injustice, but it claimed to have answers when we had nowhere else to turn.\n\nNow, we do. Now we have that knowledge, thanks to the sacrifice of many incredibly intelligent individuals, both religious and not. Sir Issac Newton is a great example. Read about his life, his faith, his fight with the chruch, and his dedication to Christ. That man sacrificed his sanity and his health for all of it.\n\nIf you disagree with science, tell science why, they'll want to hear it. Just be prepared for them to educate you as opposed to them agreeing with you. The odds that you know something they don't are very slim.\n\nThere's nothing to be gained from disagreeing just to disagree. We need to find common ground. All I'm preaching is to listen to the smartest people on the planet. I don't understand what's so controversial about that.",

You can't prove something doesn't exist, you can only show evidence that makes that conclusion highly unlikely, and science has done that.\n\nI challenge you to read your Bible from the beginning, and find where the first verifiable fact comes in.\n\nIt got the entire creation of the universe wrong, the creation of our planet wrong, the creation of our species wrong, it says that Noah is 900 years old, that's impossible, the ark is impossible, and what's after that, the magic coat?\n\nScience says something can't come from nothing. So it stands to reason right now that there has always been something. Scientists are very confident about the Big Bang, it's the conditions that lead to the Big Bang that they're still studying. So far, no sign of God. Nada. Nothing. Just as with everything else we've studied.\n\nThere's literally no reason to believe in God. Nothing out there points to a God, except for the multitude of texts all claiming to be divine, all of which have been debunked as a credible source for history and science.\n\n>Two men can read the same book and gather different meanings.\n\nOf course, but if you're reading a textbook, that's a bad thing.\n\n>even if im wrong, if me believing in a God and Christian morals gives me a happy life, as it has so far, am I really wrong? Even if God doesn't exist he has made my life better\n\nHere it is. The ego on full display. As long as you're happy, who cares about the harm it causes anyone else.\n\nDo you know how much money the Christian faith has spent fighting to oppress homosexuals? What about their happiness? Is your happiness worth their suffering? Right now you're saying, \"Hell yeah it is!\"\n\nI'm saying, do better than that.",

When people support the oppression of others, it has an impact on other people's lives. I really thought you were an okay guy up until this last post.

Stop doing this.\n\n>Earlier you said chaos reins, if that's true then why is science nothing but rules? \n\nPatterns repeat, science seeks out those patterns. Chaos disrupts those patterns, causing various effects. I was just about to go down a tunnel explaining chaos, but you don't give a fuck, so I'll just stop there. Read about chaos in science. \n\n>To me it sounds like controlled chaos.\n\nWell, you're an idiot. So, I wouldn't take your word for anything if I was you.\n\nIt sucks that there isn't a hell for you to burn in for being such a useless piece of shit.

Offerings to your God?  \n\nHis followers are supposed to love their fellow man but find only room in the heart for hate for those not \"like them\". Oppression and murder are carried out in his name in cruel fashion that they justify by his book the bible. Nothing good comes from him and his churches spawn crazies and mass shooters.

God is useless and never there when you need him. \n\nThis is the most worthless God and does nothing to improve life on earth. If there ever was a false God its yours.
