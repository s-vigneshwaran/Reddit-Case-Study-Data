This is done intentionally so that the bill would be easier to pass. \n\nWithout getting into too much detail, the part that is problematic for LGBT+ folks is the phrase, \"or in a manner that is not age appropriate\". These terms are not explicitly defined and could allow any Bible thumping parent to sue a public school for determining that knowing that homosexuality exists is not age appropriate. \n\nThis is the intent of the bill's author. Senator Baxley said that this bill is aimed at reducing the number of LBGT+ kids. He explains that kids  come out because \"overnight, they're a celebrity\". He also compared homosexual parents to abusive and alcoholic parents, saying the effect was the same.\n\nThis bill is not written for an average person with average understanding of law to interpret accurately. You must also seek out expert political analysis in addition to the intent of the bill as proposed by the author. \n\nI hope this helps explain our gay fury! \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\n\nEdit to add: the wording makes it possible for a parent to sue a school when their child is any age up to 18, not just k-3.",

I get what you are saying, but there is no specification that it is solely directed at non-straight people.\n\nThe author's statements have no bearing on what the bill is or how it can be applied, all that matters is the wording of the bill. If they wanted to make a \"don't say gay\" bill where they could oppress others, leaving the most important parts vague and up to interpretation is bad.\n\nThis is why we have districts, counties, and states. We don't have to like what everyone everywhere does, if the general population believes, ***within limits***, that something is beneficial or is in the interest of the immediate community, then they pass things like this and apply it as they see fit. It's the foundation of how we work.",

If the issue is not resolved, parents can then sue the school district or request the state Commissioner of Education to appoint a special magistrate to mediate a solution, which the school district must pay for.\n\nWhat the bill does not:\n\nIt does not ban the word \"gay\" in school settings.\n\nIt does not ban casual discussions of topics relating to sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom.\n\nIt does not require schools to notify parents if their child comes out as gay or transgender.\n\nIt does not require schools to notify parents of information regarding the student's mental, emotional, or physical well-being \"if a reasonably prudent person would believe that disclosure would result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect.\"",

So, there's not much more effort that needs to be made to explain age-appropriate LGBT topics too, and that being LGBT is okay.\n\n> The answer is nothing and the Left knows this.\n\nIt's good to make efforts to stop homophobia/biphobia/transphobia/etc, and learning about it early in a supportive manner leads to better mental health outcomes for LGBT kids.\n\n> Their fearmongering is just one more attempt at fomenting their Marxist Revolution.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Marxism?",

Homosexuality and transgenderism is not.\n\nYou are aware that we've observed homosexuality and literal shifting of *sex* in nature, right? And that LGBT people have been around for as long as human history, that we know of? \n\nAn appeal to nature isn't helpful in this discussion, either.\n\n> Furthermore, should schools teach that murder is ok as a counter narrative to idea that murder is a sin being taught at home and in churches? Any sane person would say that is crazy nonsense. As is your response.\n\nYou are literally trying to compare murder with the act of.... recognizing that different types of people exist and that we should probably take efforts to reduce bigotry and mental health issues? \n\nWhy do you think that's even remotely a worthwhile comparison?\n\nOn a side note, many people don't need religion to know that murder is wrong. It can be easily explained as a matter of consent. \n\n> Do you have any research to support this or does it fall into the lets indoctrinate the kids and hope it works out?\n\nSkimmed [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4887282/), which seems to do a good job of explaining why measures like anti-LGBT bills are bad. \n\nHere's a relevant section: \n\n>Strong evidence indicates that the presence of [sexual orientation and gender identity]-inclusive nondiscrimination and antibullying laws or policies is associated with student safety and adjustment (Hatzenbuehler & Keyes 2013, Russell et al. 2010) and provides a foundation that enables school teachers, administrators, and other personnel to establish an institutional climate that supports the policies and practices noted above (Russell & McGuire 2008). At the level of educational programs and practice, teachers clearly play a key role in establishing a positive school climate for LGBT and all students (Russell et al. 2001), and there is new evidence regarding the benefits of teacher training and classroom curricula that are explicitly inclusive of LGBT people and issues (Snapp et al. 2015a,b) in promoting LGBT student well-being. Finally, at the level of individual student daily experiences and interpersonal interactions, the presence and visibility of information and support on LGBT issues in school, as well as the presence of student-led groups or clubs such as GSAs, are strongly correlated with more affirming interactions with peers, positive school climate, and better student adjustment (Poteat 2012, 2015; Toomey et al. 2011).\n\nI can provide more if you'd like, but I have a strong feeling it won't change your mind anyway.\n\n> Marxism is the underlying philosophy of all modern Leftist social movements.\n\nPlease explain, in detail, what Marxism has to do with this topic.\n\nThen, I want you to explain why taking measures to reduce bigotry and mental health issues is a bad thing, without relying on complaining about Marxism.",

Teaching basic LGBT topics does not inherently involve sexual content.\n\nAs for an argument in favor of teaching appropriate topics, kids are going to have family, friends, or teachers who are LGBT, or might be LGBT themselves.\n\nWhat's wrong with basic explanations that those kind of people exist? \n\nKids are generally assumed to be cisgender and heterosexual, and have discussions of topics related to that thrown at them all the time from a very young age (though most people don't notice that this happens) , why not expand that slightly so they know that if someone happens to not fit that default assumption, it's okay?",

For the life of me I can't understand why folks can't leave other folks be as long as they aren't hurting anyone. We have far larger issues than if one man loves another, hell, if they can make it work all the best.

Kind of inherent in that discussion, eh? How you talk about those feelings and to which age group matters. You wouldn't say \"Billy really like having sex with Jane\" to a 3rd grader, right? You would say \"Billy thinks Jane is cute or likes spending time with her\" so why would you treat homosexuality different? \"Billy and Jack are in a loving relationship and have two children named James and Samantha\" same thing, nothing inappropriate and everyone is equal.",

I laid out my thoughts on the subject and even gave examples as to age appropriate discussion vs inappropriate. I have suggested approaches to the subject. I believe the stories lack evidence but it triggers concerns in certain circles, you know how things quickly get blown out of proportion especially when mobs and the media are involved so it makes sense to get ahead of the problem and yes there will be resistance but if the DoE is worth anything they'll come up with a reasonable way to teach the subject.",

That kind of ambiguity leaves things open to all kinds of lawsuits, and that's not good for teachers, the school system, or the taxpayers who have to foot the bills for lawyers to get involved. The original version of the bill even had a provision that required principals to tell parents about their child's sexual orientation (but only if, of course, it was something other than straight). So there is clear motive behind this bill to target gay people. Which is very bad.",

Kindergarten teachers aren't making their Tuesday lesson plans and thinking 'you know? I should teach about transgenderism and what that means in school tomorrow.'\n\nBut even if they did, who cares? Why shouldn't kids learn about real life in school? Transgender people are just people. It's not some horrible thing to fear. It's just a part of humanity.\n\nAre you afraid your kids will be fucked up because they heard that some people don't feel like their body matches their brain?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on forcing principals to tell parents that a girl might be sexually attracted to other girls? Is that something you really feel the principal of a school should be obligated to do?",

You're not worried that they'll be taught new information, you're worried that when they learn about gayness, they'll turn gay.\n\nIf a student asks the teach about what 'transgender' means in a third grade classroom, what, specifically, do you think the teacher should say? What if a student wants to ask about their two moms? Should the teacher not be allowed to mention that they have two moms? Should the teacher not be allowed to explain how two women are allowed to be in love and get married when they're doing a lesson where the students create a family tree?\n\nOr do you just think being gay is (for some absurd reason) inherently immoral, and you're afraid that the more kids learn about homosexuality, the more likely they are to engage in homosexual activities?",
