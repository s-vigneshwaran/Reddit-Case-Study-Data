In an effort to removed all controversial books from school shelves, Keller ISD tossed out the Bible too.\nhttps://onlysky.media/hemant-mehta/a-texas-school-district-just-banned-the-bible-oops/\n\nIt finally happened. The Keller Independent School District in Texas banned the Bible in school\u2026 at least temporarily. And we have conservative Christians to thank for it.\n\nKeller ISD, in Tarrant County, has seen a flurry of activity around book bans recently. Since last October, conservative parents have demanded that certain books be censored and kept away from students because they include content deemed too mature for their eyes. 33 books have been challenged by parents and community members, including a graphic novel adaptation of Anne Frank\u2019s Diary, Toni Morrison\u2019s The Bluest Eye, and \u201cThe Bible (All Versions).\u201d\n\nIn the case of the Bible, an unnamed parent raised the concern. A reason was not specified.\n\nBut according to an email that apparently went out to all principals this morning from Jennifer Price, the Executive Director for Curriculum & Instruction, all challenged books must be pulled from the library and classrooms by the end of today\u2026 even the ones that previously passed the committee\u2019s review.",

It'll probably get overturned, but it's fantastic that it happened at all.  \n  \nE:  I just went to their website, and they had a notice right on the front page about the banned book issue. The link also provided a list of all the books flagged for review and their current status. Unfortunately, the parent has withdrawn their challenge.  Maybe I'll submit another challenge.",

Just one summer our schedule had her go to the camp that's more rural where this happened.\n\n\n(same camp that as I was following some other parents back to parking one dad was raving about his kids watching Little House and how polite they were becoming. Then he started off on I, Carly with \"where are the parents in that show anyway?\" and I had to chime in with \"well, actually, the dad is in the Navy stationed on a ship\". You could just see his gears turning because he was all against it but then couldn't say anything and not sound anti-US/anti-military. I was laughing so hard inside)",

My parents decided that since it was a biblical name that they could use the opportunity to actually read of Samson from the bible to us, which was the only time I can remember ever reading from the bible at home. In hindsight, it's obvious my parents had no clue beforehand about Samson, because he was a very violent and vengeful person. In the old testament (Judges) he ripped apart a lion with his bare hands, lit foxes tails on fire and set them loose to burn down crops, and then massacred a thousand people using only the jawbone of a donkey. Later his wife gouged out his eyes. This was not the nice bible story that my parents had hoped it would be.",

Since Lot's daughters are said to have birthed Moab and Ammon, this was an ancient way of calling their neighbors \"children of incest,\" basically. Of course the story as written never happened, but the particular detail about Lot's rape and their incest babies might have been thrown in as a Bronze Age diss. Just a fun tidbit for ya.",

My father was both mythology enthusiast and a stargazer, so instead of being indoctrinated into a cult, I spent my time learning the constellations and how they got there (according to mythology).",

This all gets repeated in Ephesians 6:5 and 1 Peter 2:18 where the \"apostles\" of Jesus mandate that slaves are not only to submit to their masters, but must do so, regardless of cruelty or abuse\n\n**Misogyny of the worst kind**\n\nWhere do we start?  1 Corinthians 7:4, where Pharisee Paul tells women that *their body does not belong to them, and that they must give it up to their husband.\n\n1 Timothy 2:12-15 where Pharisee Paul tells women how they were the 1st sinners, so they should shut up, not speak in church, and they will be \"saved\" by having kids\n\nDeuteronomy 22:23-24 where only women accused of \"adultery\" will be forced to drink some bitter concoction, and if she's guilty her \"womb shall discharge, her uterus drop, and the woman shall become an execration among her people\"\n\nThere are dozens more verses for every category\n\n--------------------------\n\n**Ancient  Mid-east warlord cults from 4000 years ago were based on a brutally patriarchal culture.**  They treated women as chattel property, and practiced slavery, segregation, racism & genocide.   These desert tribes glorified violence and war, and purposely imposed brutality and male dominance of women and girls by force\n\nThose cults gave gave birth to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in that order\n\n\nUntil humans evolve and leave religion behind in the dust of social evolution, we will see nothing but war, genocide, hatred, bigotry, racism, and rampant tribalistic politics",

Obviously it should be up to the parent to be chill and help out if their Christian kid brings home a Koran out of genuine curiosity. \nThat being said that's too slippery of a slope to go down.
