You can already see it in many of the top comments here. I don't necessarily mean getting heated and invested in it, I mean assuming that it's real and allowing it to slightly shape or reinforce their worldview. Most Internet users do that more than they should, it's something you have to teach yourself not to do. You *should* be worried about it, I am too, it's a borderline epidemic, that's why I commented about it.\n\nSomeone may laugh at this now (laughing at the person's \"stupidity\" not at the trolling) and down the line say \"yeah Americans are stupid and don't know any geography, I see examples of it all the time\", not realizing that 80% of the \"examples\" they've seen are just random shit like this that they internalized a little but didn't fact check. It's an important issue because it's extremely common for people online to come up with fake interactions like this as deliberately targeted outrage bait (r/Cringetopia for example is especially full of this, as well as a lot of political communities), or they just seek out joke examples like this and present them as real by posting them in a sub like this (the subreddit rules say the confidently incorrect person must be genuine).\n\nThis example isn't specifically satire, I don't think anyone said that, it looks closer to trolling. But the point is identical for satire, trolling, fabricated outrage bait, etc. People can learn to be more self-aware with how they feel about what they see online and how to respond to it. If you're laughing at a silly post like this purely because it's an absurd situation then there's no problem, but if you're laughing at it because you feel like it's humorously consistent with some viewpoint you have, then you *should* fact check it. The fact that it's short and funny doesn't mean you should let your guard down--if anything it's the opposite, online misinformation usually takes this kind of format.",
