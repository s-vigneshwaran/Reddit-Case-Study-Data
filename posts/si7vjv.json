  "text": "TIFU by not taking a teenager's business idea seriously enough\n About a year ago I was approached by a 16 year old kid on LinkedIn with an business idea he wanted me to work with him on I assumed a \"for free until funding\" basis (I'm a UX designer).\n\nI thought it was weird to be randomly contacted, but the foundations of his idea I thought were really solid and had growth potential, so I organized a call to discuss details etc. He ended up not being able to attend that call, and when he reached out to reschedule the message just slipped through my inbox unread for a while. After all, it was just a young guy with big dreams, how many guys are out there saying they've got the next big startup idea? So a week goes past and I forget about rescheduling, and then a month goes past and I forget about the idea altogether.\n\nA year goes past and I see his company in the news receiving over $2m in venture capital funding.\n\nTL;DR - Didn't take 16yo with startup idea seriously, missed out on a good growth opportunity",

A rando walked in and fucked the leather couch in the living room.\n\nLater, after the cleanup, they all repaired to the kitchen for a tasty before sleep snack of coconut, Jolly Ranchers and mushrooms served in a shoebox that had been forcibly scraped from the wall in the son's bedroom.

When it comes to anything software development related you'd be mind blown how much some can get without seeming like great ideas.

Like (completely made up example) some guy has a code that Rick Rolls someone every time they type a certain word in to a text box if they've been Rick Rolled before. Not profitable at all, but a firm sees it and thinks having code that can both scan people's history and generate a link if they type a word could be used for advertising so they buy it anyway.",

Software IP law can get complicated sometimes, but there are protections for both the code itself and the process that it executes as long as you actually take them... \n\n\nFrom there it kinda depends on whether you want to sell it, make some cash, and be done, or to open and run a company. Surprisingly for both cold calls can actually be pretty effective and a good next step. At VC firms there are boatloads of junior associates whose dream is to find the next win for their firm, so they are actually eager to hear about potential opportunities. They aren't like \"ugh, a cold call wasting my time\" because they spend all day trying find deals themselves, so one falling in their lap that can make them good money is good stuff. All that being said, VC tends to be best for things that can either have significant growth or be sold to other businesses. They can also take more of a hands on approach than a lot of business owners prefer, where if you're going to use their money they insist you do it their way, to the point of choosing executives to appoint and whatnot. Which can be a big downside to some. Can also be a good thing if some of the business elements are trickier. Like if you're having trouble finding a cheaper factory to use or something their resources can make it a lot easier...\n\n\nOption 2, which can be best depending on how much control you want to retain and how much funding you need is angel investors. Same thing where they fund you, but its usually an individual or two doing so out of their own pocket, where VC firms are doing it with money they've raised from investors, so the two can have drastically different desires and expectations. A lot of them have really solid networks that they are a part of, like a lot of major universities will have angel investor networks of people who went to or support the school looking to support other people who did, and you can usually find pretty extensive lists of them in your area. There are two groups where I live (not companies, more just like a club) who have a dinner or something every two months that is mostly just everybody socializing and hanging out, but at each one they will have 4 or 5 entrepreneurs give a 10 minute pitch or so at the beginning, then the rest of the night people chat with them to get more details. And at those I've seen 5 or 6 investors basically jumping over and fighting each other to back someone. They usually won't be *as* hands on, though they will frequently have some of their resources and contacts at your disposal. With those its honestly just finding their websites and reaching out saying that you'd like to speak. Not nearly as hard to get in as you'd think...\n\n\nWith both you do have to be sure you're pitching a *business*, not just a product. Like know how many employees you'll need, know what facilities you'll need, know where you'll source materials, know how you plan to reach your target market, etc... And I'd *strongly* recommend at least a venture capital or startup funding for dummies type book, because it can be painfully easy to get eaten alive by fine print in deals.",

It wasn't. It was held together by trade and most of the participants in the production of goods were to some degree unfree and did not directly profit from their labor. \n\nThis is generally true for most pre-modern societies that have writing and complex materials. Because the situation in which you have a scribal class or complex trade is usually, by our modern standards at least, oppressive. \n\nThe oldest documents are indeed trade documents...from oppressive states. If you're conducting trade at a scale where you need to keep track of the amounts (which seems to be why writing or pseudo-writing systems like Sumerian cuneiform and the Incan quipu system developed), then you don't have small, localized communities. And usually societies tend to be joined together by conflict, some of the most common cuneiform symbols refer to different types of slaves, for example. \n\nI actually live in a region that used to be part of the Four Regions, Tahuantinsuyo, known as the Incan Empire nowadays. And the pre-Columbian economy here is famous for the contrast between the pre-imperial communal style of labor and the post-imperial forced labor known as *mit'a*. The Incas forced labor on all adults and used this system to build the great public works that dot the Andes. \n\nI'm not saying we don't have any information about societies that were not like the medieval European or Incan one, but we rarely see writing or castles or pyramids come out of small-scale localized communities.\n\n One notable exception appears to be G\u00f6bleki Tepe in modern-day Turkey, which was a huge structure built by a society that was primarily made up of hunter-gatherers, likely organized in small groups, that for some reason, came together, apparently willingly, to build this thing.",

It wasn't.\n\nHaving gone back and read through the conversation again, I can see that you were specifically commenting on a point about feudal Europe the previous poster had made, and so apologize for calling out the narrow focus of your comment. It was supposed to be narrowly-focused.\n\nThe thing I'm still having an issue with about your posts, though, is this assertion that localized, communal food production was so rare. I'm not sure what our modern definitions of oppressive states have to do with anything, because the discussion was about the quality of personal motivators to produce between capitalism (which many today would also call oppressive by modern standards) vs. feudalism, and whether or not a state was oppressive doesn't really have a bearing on that discussion other than being a type of motivator.\n\n>If you're conducting trade at a scale where you need to keep track of the amounts... then you don't have small, localized communities.\n\nThis assertion right here I think is completely false. Hunter gatherer groups in North America and Africa, some that still exist today, qualify as small, localized communities who engage in trade and keep record of it. You do not require a metropolis to conduct or record trade. Your use of words like \"usually\" and \"most\" are becoming hyperbolic in this conversation that requires nuance to look at completely.",

My use of most and usually is because there are ALWAYS exceptions and caveats, at this scale, you can only talk about tendencies. \n\nMy profesional background is in applied linguistics, so my entry-point here is really the writing systems and how writing (even though I personally love it) is tied to oppression, generally forced labor and slavery. And that is tied up in the means of production. I am not, however, an economic historian so I lack the subtlety to get into every niche. I just know the overall picture, because writing has this association and it's still relevant when you discuss improving literacy in certain rural areas. \n\nBut I definitely don't mean to say small, localized agricultural production is rare (it is distinct from hunter-gathering though), just that it's pre-historic. In that, those groups don't write and don't leave written records. But the vast majority of human existence has been of this nature. \n\nHere already, you can get into tons of niches that are outside of my area of expertise. For example, there are competing definitions of agriculture. I'm just going by the general layman d\u00e9finition because I don't have the time to find a specific framework you'd need to define it in detail just to make a reddit comment. \n\nSo, no nuance here. \n\nI will add that you can't generalize from modern hunter-gathering groups, because their style of life is definitively modern; it's in no way traditional and it is impossible to ignore the impact of \"modern\" society on them.",

I was discussion small, localized *food* production, which is what you said in your last post. Yes, if we've now narrowed that to agriculture, then it definitely does not include hunter-gatherer. But why are we suddenly only discussing small-scale, localized *agriculture*? Again, the original premise of this discussion was the difference in qualities of motivation for personal production in capitalistic vs. feudalistic societies, and you keep moving the goal posts around on these definitions. We do have written trade records in the archaeological record of people in many societies and types of societies that engaged in trade and had different motivators for their individual members to engage in production. We do have small-scale, even agricultural, communities alive today, even in America, Capitalism Central, and the write and record.\n\nAs for generalizing about modern hunter-gatherer, I wasn't so much using them as a window into the past, more using them as a modern example of small-scale, localized food production that exists today in tandem with record keeping. My main contention with your points is that small-scale food production and trade has never come from societies that kept records of them. It happens today.",

I was a bit lax with terminology because I didn't want to define agriculture.

I know this has been challenged, but that's the term the original comment used...\n\nI never said there's no trade found alongside small scale food production, just that there's no large scale trade. Specifically, not large enough to necessitate the *development* of a writing system. Which is true. If these societies use writing systems, they're borrowed from neighbors. \n\nMy aim was to explain that these societies tend to be poorly represented in history as a result. History is written...by those who write. \n\nWe know quite a lot about the Aztecs, Mayans, and Incas. We know comparatively VERY little about the Timoto-cuicas (my ancestors, in part, at least), who were small scale agriculturalists, and DID have trade networks and even used cacao as a form of currency at times, but did not move the same quantities of goods as the Incas. They also didn't develop anything like the quipu system. \n\nThis is one example, but the same pattern plays out across the world. It's not a maxim, though. It's just a tendency. Nothing is really a maxim when it comes to societies, people suprise you.",

A lot of people made a lot of money off that fraud and frankly those people should never have been bailed out. I don't see it so much as the economy being held hostage. The way I see it those people are like the kids with a crippling gambling addiction and instead of cutting them off we chose to enable the addiction out of the belief that we could set better ground rules for the future to prevent it from happening again.\n\nThe problem is that greedy or lazy people will always find a way to commit fraud.

Usually when an asset fails (house forecloses, business fails, etc) you just lose the value of the asset to the economy. By having derivatives that are potentially worth several times GDP tied to those assets, when they fail, you have a multiplier effect where the losses seem worse than they are and they drag down multiple areas of the economy. So instead of one person losing a house, you have a loss that spreads to every entity holding a derivative off that house. Which can be fine, as losses are spread out, but when a bunch of people lose their house the losses multiply to a point where the economy crashes. The derivatives are essentially the method of collective gambling you are against.",

But regardless I don't particularly care if people gamble and lose money even if lots of people gamble and lose money. But that shouldn't bring down an entire economy the way 2008 did. But we have to remember that in 2008 not only were banks getting fraudulent ratings for their derivatives (and derivatives of those derivatives) to mislead investors on the actual risk they were taking, but then the same banks wanted to double dip and sold credit default swaps to people because they really thought their fraud would never come to an end so they could make some easy money. If it weren't for that there still would have been massive foreclosures, but it wouldn't have been as brutal with banks having to be bailed out. Fannie and Freddie sure, but they were the incompetent ones insuring the bad loans in the first place not the derivatives.",

They take equity in the company in exchange for their funding in hopes to sell it once it becomes more profitable. You don't really \"owe\" them their money back with interest. They're taking a risk on your company in hopes that they can profit. That's why on shark tank, they ask them about valuation and sales before deciding what percent equity or royalties they want.\n\nNot to mention that venture capitalist funding is often (but not always) the best way forward. Without their funding you might not even have a company. I would say loans are actually more risky or less desired in most cases.",

Equity in a business doesn't grantee you much. It also sounds like OP was going to just get a salary anyways. \n\nEither way, the risk was high and OP has a good head on their shoulders for thinking it wasnt a strong enough pitch to keep tabs on.

I bet you didn't know you could negotiate your salary at a regular old job, let alone a startup that you're helping build from the ground up. ANYTHING is possible my guy, even negotiating a 5, 10, 15, 20% stake in the company.  The investment is the time you're putting in pro bono And again, you can get tax free loans guaranteed on your equity. \n\nSay whatever you want but factually speaking based on what happened OP missed out and he knew he did. The guy that took him up on that kid offer, also probably pro bono just because he believed in the idea and could afford taking a weekend project they believed in. Once you have enough experience in your field you can gain an eye for what projects will succeed or fail\n\n\nEDIT; Oh, and to clarify one point, yes the risk was high.

The FU comes if the company gets to Series B or later (usually more of a statement that the company will be around for awhile and that the company has some real value).\n\nIt is impressive that a 16 year got the funding and there is a good chance that the kid has a bright future ahead of him.

I work with a general contractor and how many times I have seen money get burned/opportunity lost due to our age generation avoiding phone calls. \n\nHad a similar scenario, had a youngster from my past (ironically use to babysit this kid, great kid) start a earthwork/grading company that is doing well from what I discovered. He texted me asking if I would be willing to help grow his pre construction business as he couldnt handle the pre construction/management/bidding side of things due to his growth.  He wanted me to commit to moving across the country to help him, but couldnt make time to speak to me about what he was trying to accomplish. Looking back on it, I would have moved across the country to help, but couldn't commit knowing he wouldn't make a phone call to grow his business. Prob would have gone if he would have made the time to talk. Also seems this might have been a reason he's having issues growing his business. \n\nGreat ideas start the growth, but at the same time communication would have given it the chance to blossom. Hate that it could have been great, but at the same time, if someone can't make the time for you....its hard to take a risk if you dont know the details.",
