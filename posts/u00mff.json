How long have you been aware of the Vietnam vets\u2019 experience?**\n\n>I don\u2019t know if anybody could imagine what their particular experience is like. I don\u2019t think\u00a0I\u00a0could, you know? I think you had to live through it. But when you think about all the young men and women that died in Vietnam, and how many died since they\u2019ve been back \u2013 surviving the war and coming\u00a0back\u00a0and not surviving \u2013 you have to think that, at the time, the country took advantage of their selflessness. There was a moment when they were just really generous with their lives.\n\n#\n...\n\n>>**Ironic, then, that today you\u2019re the toast of the political right, with conservative columnist George Will lauding your recent Washington D.C. concert and President Reagan invoking your name while campaigning in your home state, New Jersey.**\n\n>I think what\u2019s happening now is people want to forget. There was Vietnam, there was Watergate, there was Iran \u2013 we were beaten, we were hustled, and then we were humiliated. And I think people got a need to feel good about the country they live in. But what\u2019s happening, I think, is that that need \u2013 which is a good thing \u2013 is gettin\u2019 manipulated and exploited. And you see the Reagan reelection ads on TV \u2013 you know: \u201cIt\u2019s morning in America.\u201d And you say, well, it\u2019s not morning in Pittsburgh. It\u2019s not morning above 125th Street in New York. It\u2019s midnight, and, like, there\u2019s a bad moon risin\u2019. And that\u2019s why when Reagan mentioned my name in New Jersey, I felt it was another manipulation, and I had to disassociate myself from the president\u2019s kind words.\n\nThere are two questions between those, but they aren't that relevant.  \"Ironic\" was a reference to him saying he did everything he could to avoid getting drafted.",

It was like 95 degrees and the entire venue was on an asphalt military base. They only had one free water section and it was impossible to find for most people. The stands charged a shit ton for water, so people just drank beer instead. Food was also really expensive. Basically it was a powder keg for shit to go down, but Limp Bizkit wasn\u2019t the reason why shit went to hell. It was poor planning for large crowd sizes combined with greed on the organizers part.",

My guess is that the government is allowed to do whatever it wants with most of the information gathering methods each tech company employs. \"Facebook jail\" is not the same as real jail. Companies simply do not wield the same resources as a federal government. \n\nBusiness is not democratically controlled by society at large and their only obligation is profit, not social goods. That said, keeping the government in line is way more important than whatever twitter or facebook or youtube is up to. There are other, better, more trustworthy ways to interact with the world than those platforms. Facebook has been totally corrosive, but it can only lobby the government to act, it cannot act with  the legal force of the government.",

And no I'm not mistaking their current obsession with CRT, I mean just critical thinking in general. They oppose it because it challenges parental authority and fixed beliefs. They're against education that might challenge your fixed beliefs.\n\nThey simply cannot think critically because they never learned those skills. It's antithetical to what they are.\n\nThey can hear bangers like We're Not Gonna Take IT, RATM songs, Fortunate Son but they can't think critically about the lyrics to see what they're saying. It has to reach some incredibly high level of blatancy before they notice and hate it.\n\nGood examples I've seen online is when a bunch of conservatives got mad about the new Twilight Zone reboot. They were complaining it should be like the original series and not political. They're too damn dumb to recognize that Twilight Zone was political.\n\nOr how they get mad at comic movies for being \"woke\" and political despite that they've been political from the start they were just too dumb to recognize it.\n\nOr Z-Nation, a fantastic absurd zombie show. It features things like zombies that got into a drug warehouse and ate Viagra & meth so there were superspeed boner zombies running around. In one episode they made of Trump. I wouldn't honestly say it was super critical of the guy even. There was an election with the two candidates arguing over if it was better to build a wall or dig a hole to keep out the zombies. Anyways, I modded the subreddit for the show at the time and we got flooded with people coming pissed off that they dared joke about Trump and how zombie shows should stick to zombies and not be political. Which again, zombie media has its origins as political stories about slavery.",

Evolution, DNA, Big Bang, all of it.\n\nI'm not Catholic now and I wasn't really Catholic back as a kid either.

Christian scholars tend to claim a greater extent of persecution (up to 600 000), whereas secular scholars tend to tone down the extent, pointing to a more local / regional outbursts of anti-Christian sentiment. \n\nThe only reasonable estimate, made by a seemingly moderate religious scholar, claims some 3 000 - 3 500 deaths during the period called \u201cthe great persecution\u201d. This is of course horrible, but still pales in comparison with other persecutions. Despite widely differing estimates, it\u2019s still safe to conclude that Christians have killed far more other Christians in religious conflicts in Europe, as well as killed far more people from other religious groups (such as Jews, Cathars and other minorities) in Europe, than the Roman persecution of Christians ever did.",

Trump has called the Russia investigations a \"hoax.\"\n\n>While Mueller's was a criminal probe, the Senate investigation was a counterintelligence effort with the aim of ensuring that such interference wouldn't happen again.

You don't get to retroactively try to claim them for your own when they are now not able to point out another lie they're telling. But with this claim, did he not think Dee Snider would ever hear about this or that any of the twisted sister fans wouldn't point this out? It's also crazy to think that he believes their are any significant musicians/bands that sing about \"the attack on traditional, conservative American values\" Musicians are typically well aware of the traditional conservative American and their \"values\" because that's where the attacks towards them and their music almost always came from. The persecution complex that is deliberately and insidiously baked into their religion has allowed them to completely view things 180 degrees. They are the majority, the Christians are, I mean and yet they always bitch and moan about how they're being attacked when attacked means they are receiving legitimate opposition to their proposed religious based laws and that because they can't make it a law that denies marginalized groups access to or afforded the rights of the rest of society, they are being attacked ignoring the 100's and 1000's of years they had their way at the tops of governments and it never one time resulted in a good society for everyone.",
