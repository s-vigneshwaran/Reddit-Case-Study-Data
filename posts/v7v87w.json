The best answer to \"It's not a trick question\" here is \"It's not a yes or no question either.\" Or even earlier, answering the first question with that answer. It tells them there something complex coming up. Then you answer in [Upgoer Five](https://xkcd.com/1133/) language.\n\nBut all of that assumes that they were asking their questions in good faith and wanted to hear his answers instead of grandstanding and trying to score points off of him.

And it\u2019s not just the whole \u201cyoung people learn things easier\u201d aspect either. While brain plasticity does play a part, sometimes we forget that with people like me who are 30, I had computer class in the 7th grade where we were taught to type and navigate windows XP, and we\u2019re actually educated on technology which gave us the foundation to more easily continue building in our tech savviness as technology progressed.  \n\nHal Rogers as the drastic example. He\u2019s a **current** member of Congress who has been widely criticized for his corruption and bigoted stance on social issues still has a seat at the table for these kinds of decisions around how to handle issues in the modern world. The guy was born 2 years before Hitler invaded Poland. Was working on his law degree when people were panicking about Sputnick 1, and was elected lieutenant governor of Kentucky the same year Sony released the first Walkman for cassettes. He\u2019s supposed to be representing Americans when it comes to the legalities of targeted ads and location tracking present on the latest 5G Samsung Galaxy?  \n\nI\u2019m also not going to absolve seniors of their responsibility to educate themselves unlike we see in this video. They still have brains and there are plenty of old people who put in the effort to understand current tech at least to a basic degree of competency. The integrity based thing to do if you\u2019re unwilling to even hear about it would be to step aside and let people who do get it to make decisions. The combative and patronizing reactions are manifestations of both their resentment for living in a world they don\u2019t understand, and their annoyance that people are trying to help educate them.",

Is a \"manipulation\" literally the base code that looks through the crawled websites to generate the results to begin with, some algorithm has to be telling it what to show us so is that manipulating the crawled information, or is that just the code? Is a revision to that code a \"manipulation\" or is it just changing the code?

Senators aren't cheap and it makes no sense to believe that they are \"bought\" by anyone. This \"they must be paid off\" story we tell ourselves is just a comfortable fairytale to paper over the complexities of governance at the scale of the United States in a country as diverse in opinion as the United States. \n\nPeople have tried that stuff in the past, and regulations have gotten better and better. People go to jail for trying what you're suggesting, and it's just not worth it at this point. Ask Jack Abramoff. \n\nWhen we lean on this fantasy, it let's us think: \"of course I'm still right. those people don't disagree, they were bought!\" or it lets us think: \"why should I participate in the political process when rich people control everything by buying reps?\" Both things are weak defense mechanisms with the purpose of allowing us to comfortably bury our heads in the sand. \n\nThe senators aren't \"bought,\" they disagree with you or believe that their voters disagree with you. That's it. Make better arguments and vote to seat representatives that already agree with you. Anything less is hurting your cause.",

In order to pay/release whatever you just printed, you had to walk over to a touchscreen, swipe your student ID card, tap each job and hit print, then it would come out in the printer. \n\nThe aforementioned dumb blonde came up one day and said \"How do I print?\" and I told her the above, which was a common request. She then said \"No....how do I print from the computer?\", I was dumbfounded, but agreed to help her. I had to literally show her how to go to File > Print in Microsoft Word. \n\nThis was a large state university and I wondered how the hell this girl even got accepted.",

This wasn't the best in my IT career though. A few years ago I worked at a small financial firm in Manhattan and they had given everyone smartphones for business use, IT had to support them. I got a ticket once that a senior exec's phone was really slow. I went up and looked and it was a dude in his 40s (I was late 20s), I looked at his phone and noticed he had 90 chrome tabs open. When I mentioned that he said \"Oh, I thought those closed automatically when you left the site....\" As I started to swipe them away, standing in front of him I saw porn...porn....porn....porn...teen porn....teen porn...80+ tabs of porn. I stood there straight faced, swiping away his porn, rebooted his phone and handed it back to him saying it should be better now. Then I reminded him to always close his tabs because it will slow his phone down. I walked away and when I got in the elevator I nearly pissed myself laughing.\n\n> Did you have petty nonsense like people trying to unjam the printers themselves ? That was a huge issue. \n\nAbsolutely. We had the huge Xerox and Canon printers that were like 3-4 feet tall and in smaller labs we had the commercial desktop printers that were like a foot or two. People would always fuck with them, the funniest was when the printer would do double sided printing: it would spit the paper out about 3/4 of the way and then take it back in to print the other side, people would always try and grab it and then fuck everything up.",

I've told my mom \"I have no idea what I'm doing, I've never used this before so I'm just clicking stuff/reading stuff and seeing what happens\".

The witness starts with, \"Not by default,\" but then continues on with a longish explanation in which the senator quickly loses interest. Give the shortest, but still most comprehensive answer you can, and let them ask follow-up questions. He could've just stopped with, \"Not by default.\" I might've instead gone with, \"Only if you ask us to,\" since a lot of these people are older and with links to finance; \"default\" may only mean \"not paying back a loan\" to them, which is both confusing and not a nice association to have.Then the senator would naturally ask what that means.\n\n\"We can track your phone, but we don't unless you use apps that need to track you, and they always have to ask your permission first.\" Not this blather about, \"It depends on what services you use,\" or, \"I don't know what services you subscribe to.\" \"What the heck is a service?

Is there a limit to how much change citizens can vote for, and if so, why? If the majority of citizens agree on something, why should it matter if an their elected officials don't like it?\n\nIf every state put forward a few substantial issues, mostly the stuff that most Americans agree about, through grass roots campaigns, we could definitely make some major changes in the course of 2 to 6 years.\n\nAt the very least, we should start trying to organize huge, mostly bipartisan groups, who can spend our collective \"free speech\" and promise politicians that all our votes will go to them, along with said \"speech\" if they can enact it before an election. If not, all votes will go to whoever is most likely to do those things, and the money will go to whoever actual does.\n\nI'd actually love to help organize something like that, and with just a big enough online presence, it could grow fast as people bombard the social media of celebrities and influencers to ask if they're on board, and their followers inevitably start looking up what the group is, whether the celebrities even respond or not. A national group with chapters in every state that work on both issues for that state and the ones agreed about nationwide.\n\nOf course it would need some people familiar with the legal aspects, as well as people who know about social media outreach and organizing, but it'd basically be a democratic group that tries to force representatives to actually represent the people.",

Unless you created your own private dns server, decentralized vpn, an enterprise level firewall, or just never connect to the internet, you can still be hacked or tracked. If google wanted to track you, there's a lot of money you'd have to spend to stop them. Unless you do something bad however, like fbi level bad, then they can track with a shitload of stuff: credit card payments, traffic light cameras, where you got your last speeding ticket, if theres a house registered under your name, basically anything that makes you, you.\n\nTl;dr. People can track you, but without giving them a good reason to, they won't.",

But these questions reveal that they didn't really prepare or that they didn't have any experts advising them.\n\nI bet most of them actually believe that 'Google is censoring conservatives, because it's a leftists Silicon Valley organization'..... so they went into this hearing, planing to grill him on these types of things. At some point they started believing their own propaganda.\n\nI don't think it has anything to do with age either. Do you think MTG knows how GPS works?

They wanted the \"yes or no\" answer. They wanted \"Google\" to say, \"No, we don't track you.\" They wanted the soundbite, and wanted to be able to point at them lying. \n\nPichai was extremely clever with never answering it directly. He felt the trap. He knew if he said, \"No, not by default,\" then the \"by default\" would be cut off and this asshole would run with the story, \"Google says it doesn't track you, but studies shows it totally can and does!\"\n\nIf Pichai says, \"Yes, but only if you allow it,\" again, the rest gets cut off, and Google can be played by this jerk-off to be evil, and therefore he can push his political policies on it.\n\nThis was an asshole politician trying to pull a fast one on someone who was well-prepared for it.",

Also they may be facetious or sarcastic so it makes the questions the other side asked look even stupider.

It fundamentally shows that they don't know how location services work on their iPhone or how the iOS permission system more broadly works. If they did, a question like \"if I had Google Maps or some other Google app installed and had granted it permission to location services, could it track me\" would be a much more appropriate question. Although at that point it's a stupid fucking question. Of course it does. You fucking installed the app and explicitly granted it permission to use your location when it asked if it could.",

If you get $200 for food for the month, it makes no difference to taxpayers what you spend that $200 on.

If someone wants to complain about that potentially being unfair to any hypothetical children in the situation, have at it, but it's always \"but that's *my* money they're spending!\" Who cares? It's the same amount either way! They didn't get an extra $50 for that.",

And that isn't really their fault, the world changed very quickly over the past 25 years or so, and unless they dedicate significant time and effort it is likely they will not have learned as much as younger people. \nAdded to which, young people who grew up with the Internet did so at a time in their lives when cognitive 'elasticity' is very high - kids are information sponges, so what is obvious and intuitive to a teenager might be entirely beyond the reach of a 60-year old.\nI turn 42 in a few weeks - I grew up with very basic computers, and no formalised Internet. My secondary school had about 30 PCs for 1200 kids! I was lucky to get to use one for more than a couple if days PER YEAR. I didn't even have email until I went to university in 1998! So I fall in to a sort of middle ground between the old clueless folks and the intuitive youth.\n\nAnother thing that is rarely mentioned is that older people actually might well have cognitive issues due to environmental pollution, particularly the presence of lead. There has been masses of work that has shown a clear correlation between low IQ/cognitive ability, aggressive/violent behaviour, and the use of lead in things like fuel, water pipes, paint etc. It is pretty fascinating and makes a lot of sense.",

Young people have high tech familiarity, but similar levels of tech literacy. \n\nFor example, Android phones don\u2019t track you by default because the phone literally asks if you want to be tracked when you set it up. The prompts are intentionally misleading so as to make people think of they don\u2019t allow tracking then GPS won\u2019t work. Further, most apps that *do* track by default do it by default because Google doesn\u2019t require developers to have explicit consent for tracking. \n\nSo, even Pichai\u2019s attempted answer is so misleading that it\u2019s basically a lie and he knows it. ***You*** don\u2019t because you\u2019re familiar but illiterate.",

Some are truly as dumb as they look(especially in the House), but others know full well how dumb what they're doing is and are just playing to their base, who they know are fucking morons.\n\nSeriously, Republican officials \\*know\\* their base are morons and they treat them as such on a regular basis.  For example, look at anything Ted Cruz says on his Twitter.  Ted aint a moron, but he knows his voter base is and that's why he says what he does.\n\nIt's fucking crazy that there's a whole god damn political party that essentially runs on 'I treat my constituents like they're idiots cuz they are' as a platform and it's fucking effective as shit.",

It's bringing up those results because a lot of people talk about Trump being an idiot, apparently more than any other person at the time. \n\nAgain, I don't trust Google or any app on my phone with my location data and my personal data.

              "text": "100% correct.\n\nHumans write the code, they determine what the parameters for a search query are, the weighting of various sources, thresholds for relevancy, etc. There is clearly room for bias to be put into the system, and given that the tech world is predominantly left-leaning, it should be fairly obvious that there is going to be some very small amount of left-leaning bias in the system. Google is lying when they say \"It's not possible for an individual employee or group of employees to manipulate the search results\". The team who works on Google Search is quite literally manipulating search results, that's their job. Manipulate implies bad intentions, but that's the definition of what they do.\n\nAdditionally, like all committee hearings, part of the job of the senators is to ask leading questions. For example, the Senator asking about Donald Trump appearing when you search \"Idiot\" is asking a fair and legitimate question, and the follow-up \"There isn't a man behind the curtain determining what is shown\" is also a valid question because it leads him to get into how the algorithm returns results. You can ask a question you already know the answer to, but you want to be in official record, it's part of their job to ask those questions.\n\nReddit thinks they're so smart that if they were a Senator, he'd come in and they'd just say \"Everything is good here, we understand how everything works so you can leave\", as though that solves anything at all. Asking questions to have official statements under oath from a CEO is an important part of the process, even questions that you think are stupid.\n\nEdit: I'd also defend the statement regarding whether Google tracks your movement or not. He refers to an \"opt in\" service, but we all know how tricky these \"opt in\" settings can be. The Google CEO managed to side-step the answer that yes, on almost every Android device, your movement is being tracked. The Senator didn't word his question very well, but it's clear that's what he was pointing towards.",

The real results are impossible to manipulate unless they overhaul their entire ranking operations. If you search up cooking utensils, you would probably find ads before you get the real results but you can see those are ads, not the real search. Therefore, it's not part of SEO. These would only work on consumables. The ranking algorithm on Google's SEO is impossible to manipulate unless they overhaul their entire system. SEO basically associate the most search links to word or a phrase and provide you with the results. What it can't do is manipulate that results \"manually\" because once the real result is manipulated, it is no longer a SEO.\n\nWhat we can manipulate is the word association. For example, Covid didn't have any link to the word \"pandemic\" until COVID-19. After that, any time you search Covid on SEO, you would probably get death counts, vaccines, etc as your first results because those are the results everyone is searching up COVID to find. Popular media and internet culture can certainly manipulate the result but once SEO manipulate the results, they are no longer in SEO business and manually manipulating Google's SEO is more than an impossible task. No employee or manager or director can manipulate the results to their affability because if they do, the search engine will literally crash.",

They don't realize how out of touch with reality they've become.\n\nThis is why internet privacy, tracking, and laws like the eu GDPR are fundamental and crucial to our society.

We seem not to have perceived that, by the law of nature, one generation is to another as one independant nation to another\u2026 On similar ground it may be proved that no society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. The earth belongs always to the living generation\u2026 Every constitution, then, and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19. years. If it be enforced longer, it is an act of force and not of right.\"\n\nIn other words: each generation should govern themselves and the laws should represent each generation.

I can tell you that, by default for the most part, Google can return device location up to an accuracy of three meters at any given time. Users need to disable services in order to prevent this. \n\nGoogle employees have come out and admitted that the automated algorithm is out of the companies control at this point. It absorbs an insurmountable amount of data and returns results that can change very frequently. To be able to explain how specific results were returned based off a specific query would take weeks, maybe months, if they really wanted to walk through each thread of whys and why nots of the results. \n\nGoogle is still a shady company, as most data collection giants are, but its search engine process is so automated that it mainly focuses on user data  collection for add targeting and creating/enhancing services to bolster add targeting.\n\nMost people nowadays wouldn\u2019t know which questions to ask. I wouldn\u2019t expect anybody in congress to be able to either without years of tech knowledge in a variety of areas. \n\nReally though, the Google rep could\u2019ve said yes to location tracking based on what ive seen",

Yes those congress folks are old, ancient, outdated, dianosours, whatever you wanna call them. But you also gotta see what really are they trying to identify here. They're not just asking CEO dumb questions. These are fundamental questions which to an end user don't really matter. An average user, and i mean a broad average covering perhaps 99.9% of Google users and other \"free\" internet services like Facebook users, don't worry about how much power they're giving to these tech giants by giving constant data to them. But this is i believe what these old folks were trying to see if these processes are manipulable by humans, as they are designed by humans. Tedious, arduous, requiring days, weeks, months to accomplish but yea can CEO of alphabet really say that Google higher ups can't find something if they want to? Do they know if their device/app is in the hands of a high level government person, military person, celebrity, billionaire, country leaders or corporate rival? Again, the reality of this we would never know and it doesn't impact most users in their usage of these services. You can't use most of these apps without consenting to sharing your info. So that's that. But would it have an impact on user's behavior if such basic/dumb sounding questions were answered in a yes/no...it will remain a mystery. \n\nThank you for attending my Ted talk.",

If that controlling party is evil or greedy or just believes their position is the \"correct\" one then you start to have problems.

He's not an idiot for thinking his phone was tracking him. He's an idiot because he asked a question, ignored the answer, and then kept asking the *same question*.\n\nEither a) the CEO was telling the truth and whether *that particular phone* would track him across the room was dependent upon its *existing apps and settings* or b) the CEO was lying, and *that phone* would track him across the room *no matter what he or anyone else has done to it.*\n\nIf A is true, he was not asking a Yes or No question, but he was demanding a Yes or No answer.\n\nIf B is true, the CEO gave his supposed \"lie\" and no amount of badgering him for for a Yes or No is going to get anywhere. If his point was that CEO was lying, he should've said so, ideally with evidence. Even changing the question to \"I just bought this phone and am using the default settings. Would it track me across the room\" would have been a better question with an answer he *maybe* could've gone on record with.\n\nNo intelligent person is going to give definitive testimony about what an object someone else is holding can or would do without at least examining the object itself or some kind of evidence on its properties.

If that result is an image of trump for a search term for idiot, that means that enough people have referred to him as such to warrant that result. You can't blame \"the man behind the curtain\", because this isn't the wizard of OZ, and that's not a thing. You can blame the vast majority of people who have, rightly so, referred to Donald Trump as an idiot. It's just data.\"",

You're making a lot of assumptions.\n\nYour stats on google maps (which you conveniently changed from \"google apps\" once you realized you were wrong) are, if not wrong, extraordinarily misleading. It's by far the most used navigation app in the US and installed on a majority of smart phones in the US. If we are going to be pedantic and talk about iphone use in particular (which is beside the point, by the way), it's been one of the top 10 apps downloaded for the entirety of the last decade, and anecdotally I think most people accept the ubiquity of the service.\n\nA bit of political theater is part of the game and what his voters apparently like or understand. Maybe they are not your \"peers in California\" but they get a say in the policy process as well, as much as you seem to hate that. Lost in your really dumb example is that the bicycle card company does not know what \"card\" most people are holding. Google, however, does. Maybe not that particular congressman, and maybe it's because that person lazily opted in, but Google does likely know, and federal law needs to be amended to account for that. Leaning on state regulatory regimes like the CCPA is a half-measure.",

He\u2019s just wasting everyone\u2019s time and tax dollars.\n\nI changed my comment from apps to Maps almost immediately after posting because it was a typo. Other commonly installed Google apps aren\u2019t dependent on hardware location, so Maps could be the only ubiquitous application relevant to the point you were making, or to the question the congressman was asking about his phone. I have several Google apps on my phone, but none of them utilize geolocation.\n\nPolitical theatre is only \u201cpart of the game\u201d if your goal is reelection, not for passing meaningful legislation. This video is from four years ago, so as to the value of it, we already have the answer. Did any of this guy\u2019s \u201ctheatre\u201d lead to broader federal privacy laws? Did he draft anything? Did he even sponsor anything? Nope.\n\nCCPA led to CPRA, and it was obviously not a half measure, because it categorically changed user data security and management practices for back-end web development I was doing on the other side of the country in Michigan. So did CPPA and GDPR. It\u2019s just bizarre anyone would pat a congressman on the back, who\u2019s getting paid six figures to sit there and ask idiotic questions, while the only thing standing between Google selling information about which bathroom their constituents are using is the laws passed in other states and countries thousands of miles away.",

I may not agree but I do honestly try and read/understand what people are saying. It can just be hard to draw out a true explanation over text when it can be hard to discern between genuine and facetious tones, so thank you for still keeping the dialogue open.\n\nI do know I have a lot of common ground with people on the right. I live in the south, raised Catholic, with the majority if my family members being life long Republicans. Now that doesn't mean they are all on the same page when it comes to politics, a good example being my father whom I'd consider a \"disenfranchised Republican\" due to him going from a staunch Bush supporter (even worked for his campaign in 2000) to thinking that many Republicans have lost touch in the past 8 years. For me the change is when I saw how so many on the right spewed horrendous racist remarks non stop after Obama was elected. From the \"Muslim fear\" to the \"Birther Movement\" (thanks to Trump) all the way to Republicans claiming that white people would be enslaved. It just really unmasked so many of the people around me, something which really made it hard to look at them the same. I still cared about them, but I could no longer see my self as part of a group where so many couldn't look past the color of someone's skin, whether or not they were straight/gay, or demean them because of their gender. \n\nSo for me personally, it really comes down to equality. From gender, racial,  economic and governmental (issues like voting inequalities.) These are beliefs that are very Fundamental to how I approach my life.  This makes compromising difficult when the stances are \"Being gay is okay\" and \"Homosexuality is wrong.\" That leaves the middle ground to be \"Being gay isn't exactly okay\"\n\nI can find plenty of common ground with the other side, I mean we live in the same country and went to similar schools, but I can't compromise when it actively disenfranchises those that were already so.",

They use coercive language like \"opt into tracking to get blah blah blah features\", in order to entice users to \"opt-in\" as part of the onboarding flow, but most users lack the technical understanding to know what they are opting into so i would suspect most people, including the rep in the video would have the tracking enabled. So while the answer may be true in a technical sense, it is extremely misleading. the onboarding strategy is a funnel flow that forces users to choose, and most users opt-in without knowing exactly what or how that data will be used. and for atleast one person, it was used by the police in order to try and frame them for a robbery they didn't commit. Google, and all other data collecting companies are evil scum.",

Then you can tie that to a law that is being \u201cbroken\u201d.\n\nI think rather than laughing and pointing our fingers at these people that are outdated and not really in a position to make these kind of decisions we should stop and try to think of a better way to make these decisions.\n\nIt\u2019s not the people that are corrupt, it is the system we set up allowing for exploitation through corrupt people.\n\nThat is what we need to fix, not the old people that need to get with the times.\n\nEdit: also I don\u2019t know anything about Pichai but he seemed pretty dope in this particular situation",

They understand nothing because they live and breath as congress. Moreover they are so out of touch with the technology that runs our human world that it's not even funny anymore. I can't laugh at this shit because it's frightening. Name a technology. They know nothing about it and will pose stupid and pointless questions while trying to pretend like they are so far above it. \n\nI think that (all of that) is as failing. With Senators you get that life experience but not with Congress. They do not understand how people live their lives and they understand even less how the systems and processes around them are functioning. \n\nAnd I'm a strong believer in such things as 'no stupid questions' but at some level that's gotta stop. It's like if a NASA or JPL scientist was sitting in on a launch and they ask 'was I supposed to check the retrothrusters before I signed off on them', the fucking launch should be aborted and that person should be fired. No stupid questions in everyday life. In this kinda life there's such a thing. They should be the best of us yet at the same time still one of us. \n\nAnd they're neither of those things.",

We just provide access to articles associated with that particular word.  \n\nWhy\u2019d my granddaughter see a political ad while playing a game?   \n\nSince the dawn of advertising, companies have purchased space that they feel is most relevant to their audience. At Google, we may have not been involved with the iPhone app but we understand how advertising works. We sell space for brands and political campaigns to sell ads. Perhaps we might investigate, and share with Apple, if political ads are appropriate for children\u2019s games.   \n\nI believe that artificial intelligence is based on human intent.

Can Google or any other service track your phone movement? Yes. Apps can ask for this permission, and it's not always clear that apps will use your location data for the specific task the app was built for. Location data itself it tracked by the device, which can be queried by other apps. This is how it works on Android at least. This wasn't a dumb question.\n\n2. Would Google allow third party organizations to audit their search results? Pichai says this is already a thing, and the congressman disagrees that those were independent studies. This is a disagreement that needs more discussion. We don't know if either one is correct unless we do more research.\n\n3. If I search the word idiot, why does Donald Trump appear? This is a genuine question. Someone who has not studied internet search technology would have no idea how the system works. Pichai explained the process perfectly. He is correct in what he said happens in search. The congresswoman acknowledged the information and understands how it works now. Everyone else listening now knows how it works too. This question actually helps people understand and trust these technologies better. Not a dumb question.\n\n4. Something about a 7 year old. This one is kind of a dumb question, I'll admit. Maybe there was more context, but I'm not even sure what the congressman was complaining about. And since he doesn't even know what device or application it was on, his anecdote isn't helpful.\n\n5. Does Google manipulate search results? This is not a dumb question. Their technology is VERY proprietary. Pichai claims they don't, and at best we just have to trust him. His arguments don't have merit without proof.",

This is incredibly evident in some of the final answers. The first guy asks if Google knows he has moved across the room. After the answer he just states \"I believe they do\" when the guy clearly says it depends on your settings and applications but not by default. Another person asks if search results are manipulated at the human level. After he clearly says no (and had said no numerous times to questions)  the representative says that they still \"believe\" that they do. \n\nIn other words their assumptions are considered equal weight to the facts. \n\nThey don't do this just with technology. Certain party ideologues are famous for this. No matter how clearly or often they are shown that their belief just isn't true, they just double down on their belief. They feel that their opinion has equal weight with expert opinion, even though they have no real knowledge of the issue. \n\nThe big offenders of this you can see clearly in the topics of climate change and the abortion debates. They can be shown clearly that the world is heating up, and the last time it heated at this rate it killed almost all life. They just shrug and say something stupid like \"God wouldn't do that. \" Then we show them it isn't God, but man doing it, and they reply \"so you think you are more powerful than God?\n\nOr they will talk about abortion, saying something stupid like \"Don't you think that post birth abortion should be illegal?\" Then they are told that this doesn't happen, as that would be considered murder, just for the representative to say \"Well I believe it does happen, because a constituent told me about it. \" Just real dumbass stuff.\n\nNot trying to pick on an individual party, because I have seen both do it. It is just more common amongst states where the education isn't very good",

Odds are, you agree to have your data stored, an algorithm compiles you search results and then feeds ads back to you based on what it thinks you want to see. As for tracking, you probably allowed them to track you, again feeding the algorithm.\n\nYou stand near a restraint long enough or any store, it will compile that and recommend it or similar restraints or products or whatever it may be. No one is able to just manually manipulate the results because of the algorithm and it\u2019s strict, it is on a linear path for say and it\u2019s only adjustments, are when you yourself adjust and switch up your pattern.\n\nIt picks at it and sells your data off because you agreed. The 7 year old more than likely got the AD about her grandfather because she\u2019s on Facebook or some social media and they sold her data off. He last name matches and it was a high coincidence that sue happened to get the AD putting him in a not so favorable light. \n\nWho really believes anything these people ask and that their opinions matter?

And the guy starts going off into detail why you need certain prerequisite knowledge in order to understand the question they are asking.\n\nThese old guys are like that they ask a question that requires a deeper understanding when they think its a simple yes or no. They cant comprehend that there are many parts to something, and its not always a yes or no answer there can be, but its nested in a series of if this, then this type of logic. It just baffles me people like that are not capable of thinking non linear so to speak. I deal with callers like this all the time at work, it can be frustrating even when you explain it the best you can in simple terms. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*found the video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn\\_8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8)",

Just look at what opinion got heavily downvoted and ask yourselves: is that really a representation of reality? That alone should show you how the manipulation on Reddit works. Why in Gods name should it be any different with Google? It for free! That means YOU are being old. More specifically your data. Google does track activity even of people that dont have a phone, just by proxy and people taking photos and tagging other people on Facebook etc. Look what happened a year ago with the search results for \"mass psychosis formation\" - there was no result for a while. The side just said something like \"wait until we find the proper results for you\". Why do you think that was? Also: look at the number of results you get per search and how many of the top results are paid for. You do not agree that this is manipulating with the results? Saying that the almighty algorithm does, it as if its in control of us and not vice versa, is ridiculous.",

No. And did you notice that the sentence before start with the word but? Or that that sentence start with the word and? Or that one and this one that start with or?

They would be instantly seen as gambling features that are marketed to kids and adults via a game. And they would be banned within weeks. \n\nIt's going to take another like 25+years before people in these positions are replaced with more tech-savvy people who just understand the general idea of whatever topic is being thrown at them. This current panel doesn't even have a general idea of the basics. They ask questions that make the CEO look stupid because the CEO doesn't have an answer for it. But the question was stupid.
