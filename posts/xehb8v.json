She's not \"against sex per-se\", however, she feels that she's been \"hurt in the past\" and needs to \"give it time\" until the \"right moment comes along.\"  \n\nHe's been pursuing her for 2 years and is about to give up as the last guy did.  \n\nWhen asked about her long term relationship history, she answers that she's had several relationships.  She doesn't mention that none of them have even gotten to 3rd base with her.  \n\nSubconsciously, she has a compulsion to make each boyfriend wait for sex that is never going to happen.  Eventually, when each successive \"boyfriend\" gives up and walks away, she tells herself that he \"wasn't the one, he didn't have what it takes to be with me.\"",

All my clothes are donated to me and I save my poo to sell to compost companies. I\u2019m a Leo so you know what that means and I only want to date Virgo\u2019s. I have a healing crystal collection that I can use to heal you and am also a spiritual healer. My homeopathic remedies have cured covid, cancer and even reversed death. Need my soul partner to manifest me into their life. Finally, I\u2019m an entrepreneur; having started my HerbalLife empire and working hard for the last three year to grow my business. Just made my first $38 bucks profit!!!! So, if I don\u2019t get back to you; you know why. Me and my catkids can\u2019t wait to meet you. \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5",
