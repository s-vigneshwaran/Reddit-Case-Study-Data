  "text": "TIFU by letting my boyfriend eat my ass.\nSo my boyfriend kept telling me how excited he gets when thinking about eating ass.\n\nI\u2019ve always been against it but his constant repetition got me wondering what it would feel like so we decided to give it a go.\n\nDuring foreplay he asked me again if he could eat my ass and I said yes.\n\nIt felt so weird, got my abs tensing up.\n\nWhile licking down there \ud83c\udf51 he decided to start fingering it too, the saliva was working as lube so it wasn\u2019t painful or anything but I was feeling like I was gonna poop.\n\nI just ignored it and was just so lost pleasuring myself with my vibrator.\n\nWhen I orgasmed, I heard my boyfriend shout as if he was in pain.\n\nI was super stressed at this point, scared I might have pooped or something.\n\nHe took he face out and stared at me. It was covered in brown watery material and he ended up throwing up on me.\n\nGuess I got food poisoning or something and ended up diarrhoea blasting him.\n\n\u2026\n\nWe discussed it after he had a shower. I wanted to cheer him up so I told him I enjoyed it except the poop part. He just sat there in shock for a while and told me he doesn\u2019t want to eat my ass again for a while.\n\nTL;DR I tried anal foreplay and ended up pooping in my boyfriend\u2019s mouth.\n\nEdit: As someone pointed out - \u201cthey were basically inducing peristalsis of both the inner and outer sphincter with the fingering and vibrator. Makes ya wanna poop.\u201d\n\nGood to know \ud83d\udc4d\n\nEdit 2: People who are saying that my boyfriend is toxic and manipulative clearly don\u2019t know him.\n\nI let him talk about his fantasies, it turns me on.\n\nThe world isn\u2019t black and white and adults are capable of finding something previously unacceptable to them acceptable.\n\nEdit 3: I keep getting spam from support saying someone reached out to them.\n\nJust to make it clear, I\u2019m not traumatised by this experience and find it slightly funny. No need to offer me emotional support in messages either \ud83d\ude42",

To quote him \"There are 'in holes' and 'out holes' and the anus is an 'out hole'.  No amount of washing, bathing, or enemas will clean away the fecal bacteria that inhabit that realm.\"  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)\n\nI find it to be \"meh\" anyway, so I am fine with it.  The most tantalizing thing I can say about that \"region\" is that I like vibrations around the outside of it, but not in it.\n\nI have approached the subject of anal play for him multiple times as I know men have zones in there that are most responsive.  Perhaps a slim vibrating wand or butt plug?  And while he admits that he knows it could be pleasurable, he will never be comfortable with it.",

Again, because it seems mildly kinky but still acceptable.",

When they start getting old enough to ask you to play, and want to show you pictures , and weird shit they made with their toys, every joke...say yes and watch them and be with them as many times as possible. I think there's a general guilt among parents later on for missing out on some things. No one is perfect, so it will happen. But do your best to minimize it. It goes by so fucking fast.

Just asked while they were turned on and it turns out most of them are into trying it.  There's probably only about a dozen women that got on that list before I decided I really didn't care for it and what I found was that women really split into thirds on the topic:  1/3 didn't care how you fucked them as long as they had sex, no care whether it was anal or vaginal.  1/3 tried it and hit \"oh hell fuck no\" pretty damn quick.  The point of this comment is the other 1/3...these women were so hot for anal that they'd get upset if I wanted vaginal sex.  One of them brought it up before I could while we were having sex \"Ok, this is great, but you have to fuck my ass!\".\n\nMoral of the story is people like what they like and there's a hell of a lot of them that *really* like anal and would totally do what that gal said and would broadcast it hoping to get more.",

Just like with food, why knock something until you try it and know, for sure, if you do or do not like it. \n\nStory time: my husband grew up with sex and sexual topics not being discussed in his house, and if they were brought up, he was basically shamed for them. Due to that he was very vanilla (and a virgin) when we met, and every sexual thought he had he thought it was shameful to think that way. Doggy style was the craziest he was willing to get, and still just standard piv. Meanwhile, with me being a bit of a freak, I would get him to try new things, some he liked, others he didn't. But it took me almost a decade to get him to try anal, and it's seriously one of his (and my) favorite things now. I had an old reddit account where I posted more in depth about this experience and getting him to try new things, and got absolutely shit on for \"pressuring\" him.",

Definitely don't overdo the enemas, but if you have a healthy control of your diet and IBS, you can comfortably clean yourself out enough to have a safe play space. Also showering or at least cleaning yourself beforehand can help too. Just be prepared for it to take longer than expected to prep the hole for insertion.\n\n If you have plugs and other toys, you can get used to the sensation before involving your partner and full on penetration, but lube well and reapply as needed. Don't use silicone based lube with condoms. And go with lots of preparation. Tongue into a finger into 2 fingers, a small plug into a larger one into 3 fingers, then a toy with some depth but A FLARED BASE, then maybe try a penis. Move up as you're comfortable and if it hurts, take a moment to relax and reapply lube. If that doesn't help, you may be done for that cession. Your partner should be willing to go at your pace nice and slow until you feel ready to try rougher and he probably won't finish the first time or 2 you go back there or may even lose his erection at times during these early parts, but I'm the long run it's worth it if you enjoy butt play to do it right. Clitoral stimulation can help as can orgasming before you start trying to stretch your ass. Also do kegals and reverse kegels for your front and back triangle every day or so just for good measure.\n\n Other tips include putting down a towel to catch excess lube and put baby wipes by the bed so you can clean him (or yourself) up if you want him to resume activity somewhere else after or in between attempts. \n\nGood luck and if you have any questions, feel free to ask",

Depends on how clean you want to be (hence the fiber and enemas people are suggesting), but a lot of anal sensations are about literally just feeling it out. Partly getting IBS under control, partly knowing what is a good feeling and what is bad. \n\nI feel best when I have had my \ud83d\udca9 of the day and it's relatively normal. Most debris doesn't stay in the rectum, so occupying that space for a little while is unlikely to draw much out. Butt plugs make this more likely (something about it staying in you for longer). I find that if I feel like my guts are sensitive that day they will feel inflamed inside as well. \n\nBut the sensations help because there is a nerve in your ass, right after the sphincter) that tells you if you have to go. That can be stimulated during and give you a false alarm. By doing this you can sus out if the urgency you feel is going to be n issue, or if it's because of the object inside of you.",

An enema kit contains a solution that at minimum draws more water from the body in to the colon to help soften and dislodge stools. Some contain glycerin or a gentle type of soap that also stimulates the lining of your colon to induce peristalsis. Some contain a combination. I would recommend to OP that the next time she wants to try any anal play she use a gentle oral laxative to help clean out and a proper enema kit to get a good clean on down there. Having the plumbing cleaned out can make a world of difference for everyone involved.",

But some people feel an urge to use it in context of a serial killer. Hey, he killed seven people, massive red flag!! You don't say.... but as you said they use it for everyday situations too.\n\nI love how in all relationship posts (and especially in AITA posts) most advices are to break up. Those people are SO dramatic and out of touch with reality. \nIf a breakup or a divorce were solutions of every situation there would be no couples left. No communication, no discussion, just break up and go to therapy at first problem you encounter.\n\nI wonder if those people are some fat asocial weirdos who never had any sort of relationship with another human or just unable to communicated their feelings.",

Something seemingly small gives them the feeling of \"I've been here before, and it didn't work out well,\" and so they have a strong desire to withdraw to avoid getting hurt again.\n\nThe healthy way to deal with this is to learn how to discern between someone who is actually toxic, narcissistic, and abusive, and someone who is good-natured even if imperfect. Part of this requires considering someone's \"green flags\" in addition to red flags, so you get a more complete picture of the person. The most important part is recognizing that we're all humans, and we all have different values, personalities, and past experiences that influence our emotions and our actions. Everyone is going to be toxic and abusive sometimes; the difference is that good people don't want to be.\n\nAn unhealthy way to deal with this is to hyper-focus on red flags, finding any excuse to disqualify someone so you can reject them before they have a chance to hurt you. This has led to a subculture that completely revolves around looking for the abuser in everyone. These people find it everywhere because it is, in fact, everywhere--even if in small amounts. Unfortunately, it becomes very hard for them to get into healthy relationship because when they do find a genuinely good person, they will end things at the first sign of trouble.\n\nBe kind to them. They're hurting just as much as everyone else, and calling everything narcissism is how they lash out. The way to show them they don't need to do that is by being genuinely kind and caring, proving to them that not everyone wants to hurt them.",

And it's not at all unheard of for someone with poor boundaries who gets taken advantage of to downplay and defend the actions of the person who is taking advantage of them.\n\nI mean, isn't it a bit odd that OP both described the behavior in a way that makes it sound like it bothers them, while simultaneously saying it doesn't?\n\nI know personally what it's like to have poor boundaries and sometimes I'd give in on something because I didn't know how to, or couldn't stand up for myself (idk how best to put that). Hell, I still do that sometimes, just less so. Doesn't automatically mean the other person is evil and plotting, but no means no and people who think \"no means no until I get a yes\" are very concerning as a mindset. It can just be innocent and somewhat annoying persistence. It can also be preoccupied knowing you're dealing with someone who has poor boundaries and will eventually cave not because you \"convinced them\" but because they have a hard time keeping boundaries up.\n\nHow are we supposed to help people be safe if there is no in-between place that is allowed to be concerning? If it's only \"they are the worst person ever\" or \"this is absolutely normal and nobody should ever question it as behavior.\"",

I couldn't wait untill the morning before telling someone!!!\" I was high af and ready for bed but there was no way I wasn't going to listen after that intro. He goes on to tell me how they went back to her place and things got heated. Mid way through their session she tells him how much she loves anal. Not one to disappoint, he tells her to go for it. She's on top so pulls him out of her and eases him into her ass. She's getting off on riding him and he's laying there in disbelief how luck he's got. All good so far! Then it happens. He can feel he's about to cum and, as you should, tells her so. She quickly lifts herself off him and slides down the bed to blow him to finish him off! He can't believe this is happening and looks down to enjoy the show when he spots a small nugget clinging to the tip of his dick. She's maintaining eye contact with him and hasn't spotted it but before he can say anything she's down on him like a fat kid on cake. He freezes and tries to speak but the words won't come out. 0.0000005 seconds later, her face changed from pleasure to pure disgust as she realises what has happened runs to the bathroom. She came back and all he could do was ask if, \"everything is OK?\". She said yes but feels a bit unwell and asks if he minds leaving. He does!\n\nTL/DR housemate did anal with a girl and she accidentally ate her own shit off his cock!\n\nEdit: spelling",

This however, was only like a year into the relationship, so keep that in mind. Still in the \u201cnever walk around in slob-chic like holey sweats, with hair that looks like Alfred Einstein\u2019s, and always have on at least a very light **looking (but product-heavy) face of makeup\u201d. The whole woke-up-like-this thing \ud83d\ude44\n\nHe was wanting to try anal some time, but I wasn\u2019t up to it yet, kinda freaked me out. Never had anything up my butt besides a colonoscopy lol. So the finger. Finger lubed, so far just ok. Not painful, but not especially exciting either. Finger came out, start with the regular sex situation. He rolled me over and time froze. I looked over my shoulder and he was like a deer in headlights. I ask what it was and he just pointed. When he pulled the finger out, there came with it a small pile of rabbit-turds. That smelled HORRENDOUS. \n\nI was nearly terminally mortified. I mean I was still in the trying-to-impress stage and so was he, so that\u2019s where we were. We got up, changed the poopy sheets. I must have rolled over before arising, because (please kill me. I still feel a twinge of cringe after all these many years) he said \u201cumm, hang on a second\u2026\u201d and OHMYGOD, he picked off three turds that had stuck to my back when I rolled over to get up. I cried in the shower. He was sweet though, told me embarrassing things he\u2019d done, said it wasn\u2019t a thing etc etc. \n\nFast forward 10 years and I decided we should go ahead and give the back door a whirl. Again, slow, lubed up, careful, and gentle. I wasn\u2019t super-turned-on but it felt ok. I got mine before that so I was good. He finished, pulled out and a rush of runny shit came out and down my leg (we were shower-fucking). And his *whole* genital area, dick, balls and inner thighs, were plastered with the most foul smelling shit imaginable. This time we both recovered quickly. Like he said at the time \u201cwell, stick something up an asshole and shit follows it out. No big deal\u201d and he laughed. I then laughed too and we washed off the shit. \n\nThings shake out so differently when you are a new couple, as opposed to 11 years and counting lol.",

It's this annoying thing from many decades ago where you jam your finger up someone butt - but usually when they are clothed.\n\nWell, she did this \"up the touch\" thing to her boyfriend - but with her toothbrush holder - and stuck it just slightly inside his butt while they were in the tub.\n\nMuch to her surprise, he liked it - a lot - and had her keep doing it.  Well, when she pulled it out, the end of it was covered in a huge glob of crap.   She leaned over the side of the tub and puked all over the floor.\n\nI still remember her coming back into our room and saying \"So Chris might be gay,\" and him covering her mouth with his hand and telling her to shut up.  It wasn't until later that she told me to whole story.  We'd never heard of anal play, so of course we thought he was a weirdo.  I secretly thought she was a freak, too, for ever using a toothbrush holder on him.  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)",

This is called peristaltic contraction.\n\n\nThe nerves in the anus are particularly sensitive, and when stimulated, they trigger a colonic reflex in the myenteric nerve plexus that causes a strong urge to poo. In fact, digital-rectal stimulation of the anus is a means of alleviating constipation in infants. Can't say I'd be willing to try that myself.\n\n\nWhat I mean by all this, though, is that if you are a fan of tonguing the fartbox, a face full of something awful isn't a question of if.

Some people will argue it's not necessary, but no one is claiming its necessary, it's beneficial and makes for a better experience for BOTH partners.\n\nEven without food poisoning it removes any small 'material' that may be near the exit. It also provides a very clean area that you just cant achieve with soap and a shower. As the recipient you will be more relaxed and comfortable knowing you're clean and nothing embarrassing can happen. Your partner will also always appreciate and enjoy everything more when it's hyper clean. Anal play is a regular part of my wife and my sex life, neither of us is embarrassed or easily grossed out, if you're gonna play there then sometimes things happen. However, its universally more enjoyable when neither person is thinking about any gross material, tastes, or smells. With a cheap bulb enema from amazon and a shower, adding anal play will ONLY add pleasure and never result in any unpleasant sex events. It's totally worth it. My wife was not originally interested in anal play but now that shes comfortable with being clean and I'm super into foreplay and going slow and she LOVES having it as part of our normal sex life. The entire secret to enjoying it is the recipient being super comfortable. You wont even enjoy anal foreplay if you're tense or worried. As soon as you become confident nothing bad will happen and realize if feels good the pleasure actually goes up several levels. It completely changes the experience and that's when my wife went from trying it cause I liked it, to wanting me to do it every time.\n\nEdit: *aren't normal",

      "text": "And today we learned the importance of douching.  As a gay man who's only option is ass, I'll just say there is an accepted risk associated with doing anything involving anal.  You just have to accept that sooner or later you're going to have a code brown.  Shit happens.  While your man may have gotten the worst case scenario, it would be really difficult to have that bad of an experience again.  I say give it another try.   Just, ya know, douche first.\n\nI'm going to address the sensations you were feeling because I think it's important for anyone thinking about trying anal.  The feeling of needing to poop can *usually* be quelled with better lube.  But, at the end of the day, you are stimulating your poop chute so that feeling is pretty normal.  Also, your headspace has a huge impact on how pleasurable the experience is.  If you're not into it, it's just going to feel like pooping.  If you are into it, it feels very natural and it feels absolutely nothing like pooping.\n\nTell your man to take a shower, brush his teeth, and get back on that horse!",

The best advice other than that I have is not to attempt it unless you\u2019re very turned on because then it just hurts. As for getting your ass ate, idk to me it feels similar to when I\u2019m being eaten out. I also second the commenter who said not to finger yourself while anything is in your ass because it will stimulate it and make you pass stool. I hope the next time is a better experience for both of you",
