As the Bible became more prominent in the English language, however, Satan came to be the stand in for the name of angel who filled that role. \n\nIn Arabic, particularly the dialect used by Saddam Hussein and the Taliban, Satan still had the original meaning. This is why we (western countries) were called the Satan during his broadcasts.\n\nSo no, Satan did not love him.",

Also, the number may be factionary and unrelated to reality, however the movement was indeed huge among ukranians and ex-ukranians. Even jewish ones, they got a special term as \"zhido-banderovitz\".   \nZhid - is ukranian slur for jew. And polish actual words for \"jew\".   \nDespite that, there are jews who wear RS flags and call them self praudly \"zhidobanderoviz\". In Israel we even had a scandal, when one of the news channel redactor where found out to be a RS follower. She got fired back in 2014-2015, but some of ukranians where not pleased about that.   \nThe whole situation is a huge brainfuck.",

The purpose for amending is the argument to address.\n\nOkay, so a few things here.\n\nStarting with your idea position. The idea of amending the constitution is literally written into it and not an argument you want to make. Example: The idea of amending 2A had been around for a long time. The **purpose** for amending, I believe, is what you mean and what you want to focus on arguing.\n\n(Yeah, I have a thing about using the correct word in the correct way.  Especially, when dealing with constitutional topics. Sue me.)\n\nAs for 'they'.  I've dealt with this argument before.  Saying that the government can amend the constitution is misleading. If it actually could, that would be a bad situation. Amend this. Amend that.  It'd be happening with each swing of power in Congress.\n\nFortunately, the ***true*** authority to amend lies with the people.\n\nPer the Constitution, there are two methods to amend.  The one you're concerned with is when Congress ***PROPOSES*** an amendment.  They don't have the authority to actually amend.\n\nA **proposed** amendment then goes to the States for ratification by the various legislatures.  It is there that the people, the citizens of America, make their stance (agree or disagree) known to their state representative who, ostensibly, will cast a vote on ratification aligned with the majority of their constituency.",

Wagner Group is an illegal extension of the GRU effectively created so Putin could commit war crimes without direct backlash coming to him, simply for deniability purposes. They even had a sham court in Russia for the war crimes they\u2019ve committed in Syria but they\u2019ve been Putin\u2019s attack dogs from their inception (with \u201cPutin\u2019s Chef\u201d in charge). They have committed war crimes in half of Africa and now Ukraine. So tell me again how they\u2019re the better guys in this equation? Extremism is bad by definition but it\u2019s a hell of a lot more understandable in someone who has his back against a wall than in nutjob like Utkin, the \u201cformer GRU officer\u201d, who hops around the world and gets to killing anywhere Putin needs him.

It's real simple. EU, NATO, and US weapons are being sent to Ukraine for them to use. Those weapons are going to be used to commit war crimes. We shouldn't send Russia weapons to commit war crimes with. We shouldn't send Azov Battalion weapons to commit war crimes with either. In 2015 the US Congress passed a law that no aid we send to Ukraine in that package could be given to the Azov Battalion, but the 2018 congress didn't. Extremism is bad by definition, but the extremists that we're funding are a bigger problem **for us**. Also, Nazis are a special brand of extremists and should not be equated with other kinds of extremism, **especially** in Eastern Europe. The symbols on the Azov Battalion uniforms are [Wolfsangel](https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/wolfsangel) and [Black Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sun_\\(symbol\\)), neither of which resembles a letter in the [Ukrainian Alphabet](https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/47615117/The-Ukrainian-alphabet).",

The number of atrocities Wagner committed in Africa alone (mass rapes, torture, executions) makes Azov look like Boy Scouts.

Getting shot with a bullet coated in pig fat doesn't mean you can't get into heaven if you're a Muslim (or a Jew). That is some nonsense cooked up by white supremacists based on their deeply flawed ideas about Islam and Judaism.",

Either is preferable to meeting a professional and organized force. War isn\u2019t kosher or halal - war is people getting blown up. If your \u201cclean\u201d bullet hitting civilians is fair game - so is my dirty bullet hitting the military personnel targeting civilians.\nAs about US sending weapons for Ukrainians to commit war crimes with - well, I don\u2019t believe they\u2019ve been accused of any yet. And how would you even track that in today\u2019s global arms trading market? Russians are getting shot at/down with tech from everywhere, including Russia. Not like Russians are being inconvenienced by the \u201cGhost of Kyiv\u201d - they\u2019re being repelled so far with smaller arms you could buy from dozens of other countries and probably even more individuals in the world.",

Including into Ukraine. They are a \"private\" military company that is armed by Russia and seizes the geopolitical interests of Russia and their Allies. The Wagner Group has also been criticized by UN for committing some of the most [heinous warcrimes](https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=27717&LangID=E). The United States and multiple other countries have sanctioned Dimitry Utkin and the Wagner Group a long time ago; yet Putin and his infestation of oligarchs continue to not only allow Wagner to operate in Russian territory, but support their actions.",

That's about all I've seen as something real anyone can point to, and despite the national corps political party growing out of it as far as I've been able to find they don't really run anything. Im absolutely open to evidence to the contrary but I've just seen people yelling about imperialism and such rather than give literally any other evidence so I doubt it. \n\nFor anyone thinking the azov regiment is who they mean: given that Russia also decided to use a specifically nazi group of mercenaries (the Wagner group) to try and assassinate Zelenskyy, the idea that \"they've got nazi soldiers\" is the actual reason is absolutely ludicrous. If that were actually a valid reason to attack then literally anyone globally would be totally justified in overthrowing Russia as well, but somehow I suspect putin would object to the \"denazification\" efforts he's putting into effect in ukraine.",

Ok so you want to get rid of the azov battalion; a reasonable goal, nazis should always go die. The way to do that is apparently send in conscripts with tanks to occupy the country's land and shell unrelated civilian areas, killing non-combatants? Completely taking over the *not nazi* government is not a reasonable response to there being some nazis in their military, and if it was then that would absolutely be a reason for literally anyone globally to be completely justified in conquering Russia too (see again, Wagner group)\n\n\"oh yes we must conquer Ukraine because they've got a unit of nazis in their army. Let's use the unit of nazis we have to assassinate their president.\" All you have to do is spell it all out and it's clear how dumb and contradictory that narrative is",
