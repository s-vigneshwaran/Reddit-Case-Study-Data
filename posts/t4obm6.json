  "text": "TIFU by agreeing to get together with an old friend\nTwo days ago I (19m) was hit up by a girl (19f) who was visiting my local area. She was only there for a week and I hadn't seen her since I was 7/8 so I agreed and thought it would be fun.\n\nYesterday we went on an early morning hike and I thought we had a lot of fun. She stayed at my house afterwards until she was pretty much forced to leave by me having to go to work. \n\nIt is at this point that I should probably mention I had no feelings for her in any way. I just felt like we had a connection as friends. So i suggested we go with her friend to a bar together in the evening since she was leaving the next week and I thought it would be fun.\n\nRed flag no. 1\nI show up at the location and has specified and could not find her or her friend. Also there was a wedding happening at the venue she specified?\nI tried calling and everything but she didn't answer. Eventually I managed to bump into her and two friends and they thoroughly convinced me that they were as confused about the wedding as I.\n\nSo we grouped up, started chatting and headed to a pub different from our original plan. \n\nNow I also want to mention that right from the start we talked about how we were going to split the bill. I was going to pay for my beer. The girls agreed to pay for the wine. One of the girls also ordered an expensive meal and said she would pay.\n\nThe music was great and the alcohol flowed. I'm not much of a drinker but I had a freaking amazing time. Nearing the end of our time there one of the girls suddenly got up and left. Now this is where I got confused, partially due to the alcohol and partially because I'm pretty trusting. The other two girls explained that they wanted to get a taxi with me back to their place to chill a bit longer before I would head home myself (again, there was no implication of sex or anything and I did not want any).\n\nSo yeah... They left me there telling me they were fetching this other friend back...\n\nI'm a student so I have no money either. If I'd tried to pay for their two bottles of wine, my beer and the meal then my card would have declined.\n\nHonestly the only things that kept me from rage was the excellent people at the restaurant who treated me with respect and allowed me to figure out how to pay. Also there was an incredible performing bassist there who offered to help me out until he saw the bill.\n\nI didn't know people were that awful. I couldn't afford it and they knew that because we had talked about my job and how I need to save and pay for my own university tuition. \n\nThe girl who I've known since I was tiny declined all calls and blocked me on WhatsApp. I'm so glad that my father is close with her family because I'm needing to get that money back (my father had to come and bail me out of the situation, bless him).\n\nEDIT: As this is gaining a bit more traction I do want to mention that my gf called me and helped me through the situation. I am so grateful for her and will relay any messages from the comments to her :)\n\nTL;DR: I trusted someone I thought was my friend and they left me at a pub with a bill that I couldn't afford",

You only live once, and life is truly very short as we have seen from the recent years. Being negative towards others is a waste of energy and not worth it, meanwhile being positive can make someone's day and it's all for free. Try to be positive, at least towards people you don't know and are barely making a joke.\nI know you are just a stranger, but I am taking my time writing this because during these tough times world-wide, everyone could use some positivity.\nAgain, hope all goes well for you!",

Voices are of course trainable, but much less so than proficiency on an instrument.  I agree that the other musicians have to put in a lot more work, but with an instrument a little bit of work will outweigh talent.  With vocals, someone with years of vocal training may still be a worse singer than someone born with a good set of pipes.",

Witnessing the effect my good intentions have on others causes more depression than anything. Anxiety doesn't creep up because I'm always genuinely trying to be my best. Its when that inevitably fails to be enough for people that brings me down. My wife is amazing, and before my diagnosis things were very, very difficult between us. When your spouse always forgets things you tell them, or ask them to do, it feels like they don't care about you or what you're saying. Now she helps keep my symptoms in check, keeps me aware of them and encourages me when I start to discourage myself out of hopelessness. She's gone from my accuser to my saving grace, and I'd be comically/tragically lost without her.",

I've never heard the saying before, but that is the way I think it was meant.\n\nI really like the idea. It can really diversify who you call your friend.

And people tend to trust those that look like them more than those that look different. Being generous to all helps to mitigate that human bias and see that there are assholes in all groups.",

If someone cannot pay a bill, and the manager on duty isn\u2019t willing to comp at least part of the bill, the police are absolutely notified and a report is filed. Holding on to the last man standings id or any item of value, has never been an option. On more than one occasion on the bar, I\u2019ve kindly cashed out guests who are unable to pay, simply to avoid notifying the police. In this case, I would have done just that, whether on bar or on the floor. Chances are that I\u2019d have been able to cover the tab and while I would have hoped the OP would come back at some point to square up, I wouldn\u2019t have held my breath. A few years back, I served a group of 20 somethings who were running up quite a tab, so I required they settle with me and start a new tab, because my instincts were telling me that they were either planning to chew and screw, or they were going to end up with a bill they couldn\u2019t afford. And I was glad that I did request that because they all fumbled for enough to cover the bill and still came up short, and I hadn\u2019t even added the automatic gratuity we usually included, which would have been almost $200. I not only didn\u2019t get a tip, but I paid $119 out of pocket to cover the rest of their bill and another $60 tipping out the busser and food runners",

As a server/bartender, part of our job is not only tending to the guest, and represent the restaurant/bar, but to also ensure everyone pays. Most restaurants will forgive one \u201cwalkout\u201d and comp the bill, but usually they won\u2019t forgive 2 or more. It is the responsibility of the employee to ensure people pay their bill. Most recently, I had these 2 guys who come in multiple times a week and alway have a beer or two and a meal. They always pay and they always tip really well. A few weeks ago, they left $15 in the book, thanked me and left. I didn\u2019t immediately collect the book, because I was busy, but when I did, I immediately noticed they had only left the $15 on a $62 bill. I took the hit and cashed it out, because I knew they would be back and that I would get it back. And sure enough, 3 days later, they came in for breakfast. I am friendly with them and I was completely comfortable confronting them and one guy, Jake, left the $15 as a tip, believing his buddy, Deshawn, had paid the bill with his cc. Deshawn thought Jake was paying the total in cash. It was miscommunication and they squared up with me. Not a big deal. But when I don\u2019t know someone, I do tend to pay much closer attention because I can\u2019t be sure they\u2019ll ever come back. This is not unusual practice. If employers were agreeable to comping walkouts, then who is to say servers wouldn\u2019t falsely claim guests walk out and pocket the money. As it is, servers and bartenders have been known to adjust the tip amounts on guests checks when they don\u2019t like what the guest left. (Always check your POS purchases \ud83d\ude09).",

In a perfect world the police would do something but more often then not the server or manager on duty would have to cover it. Even if the police were to somehow find the thieves (let\u2019s not sugar coat it here, it\u2019s thievery) and head office would get their money back, head office sure as fuck wouldn\u2019t pay back whoever covered it. \nRegarding holding onto a valuable, it\u2019s standard in every restaurant I\u2019ve worked in. Every single one. Maybe things are different for you in the USA but here in London (can\u2019t talk for the rest of the UK) it\u2019s very standard practise. I\u2019ve even been warned of people making a scam out of it. Another branch of a restaurant I used to work for had a couple come in with a bunch of shopping bags from expensive clothes shops. They are and drank, when the bill come they pretended to have forgot their wallet but said they\u2019d happily leave all the \u201cexpensive shopping\u201d they had while they get the wallet to pay. Manager agreed, turns out the shoe boxes in the bags were all filled with old crappy shoes",

I cannot think of even one time where a guest asked to leave something in exchange for reimbursing the payment. More than that, I\u2019d be  VERY hesitant in agreeing to this, because it would be unlikely they\u2019d pay their bill in full and tip appropriately. I\u2019m truly unfamiliar with anyone ever agreeing to this for a stranger. A regular, yes. Definitely. Because regulars also have contact with other guest outside of the restaurant and we know we\u2019d get it back.",

Imagine you own a bar and at the end of the night some 19 year old kid you've never met is trying to give you some sob story about how their friends ditched them and they can only afford to pay you $53 dollars and not their entire $600 tab. \n\nIf you are the type of restaurant owner that says \"oh how sad, you just give me $53 and we can try and sort the rest out later\" your restaurant ain't going to be around much longer. I've seen this first hand. Used to work at a pizza place where the owner would let family, friends, and friends of friends come in and get obnoxious amounts of food for free or at heavily discounted prices. We are talking meals that should cost around $200 for free. He'd do this at least once a week. He also let us employees eat as much as we want anytime we were working for free. Needless to say he had to sell his business because he was hemorrhaging money.\n\nAny restaurant worth their salt is going to tell you you are responsible for the bill tonight and you can sort it out with your friends when you leave. Which is actually a very nice alternative to them calling the cops on *you* because for all intents and purposes you are the stiffer. \n\nI hope OP learned a life lesson here. The way to avoid this in the future is always ask for at least your check to be seperate if you are worried about how much you have vs. How much your friends are going to order. It doesn't even have to be a big thing, when the water comes and asks if you want water be like \"yeah, and I'm not really sure what they are going to be doing, but can my order be on a seperate check?\", and Boom, you avoid this problem because you made it clear you weren't with them financially. Now you can just pay your tab and call the cops because you aren't the stiffer. The only reason OP is still on the hook is because he let all this stuff get put on the same tab.",

He did not, so he is on the hook for everyone's stuff because he was the last one there. No, you cannot bully him, there is no trick to be done as the restaurant was legally in the right, and of course you can't take his stuff. But I didn't say any of that. There are 2 options from the restaurant's point of view. OP can pay the tab and gtfo or we can get the cops involved and go from there. OP obviously went option 1 and called his Dad to help him out. Far better than the alternative.\n\nIt would seem a lot of people don't understand how a tab works. Say you go out to eat with your friends. If you ask for a seperate check at the beginning of the evening then, as you are saying, you are only responsible for what you got. Someone dips out and stiffs the restaurant that isn't your problem, you have your own bill. Now if you don't say anything about the check and the waiter rings everything up as one...well you are all equally responsible for the check. You can split it up amongst yourselves however you want, but if that check is $500 the restaurant will expect $500 at the end of the night. If you try and give them $380 and a sob story about how your friends left...they aren't going to care much. You'll be told something to the effect of \"well, we are still going to need that additional $120. Not really our problem where it comes from\" which is exactly what went down here.\n\nNot to mention we are both probably talking about American laws and have no idea how this works in SA. Obviously similar because what happened to OP here is what would happen to any patron at any restaurant I've ever worked at.",

While that might be true, the fact of the matter is that their actions are what brought the consequences in a fair manner, not yours. You would not be actively making them bad people. You would simply be telling everybody the truth that they are bad people.\n\nAlso, one thing to consider is that you would possibly be protecting others from being hurt in the same way you did.  Imagine if you went to a local forest preserve and fell into a trap hole which staff deliberately set for you. Would you feel at fault if you put up a sign saying \"the staff caused me to fall into a trap hole and causes great damages to me\" and people decided no longer to visit? Of course not.\n\nThat said, it is entirely up to you, as you will likely never see her again. You are free to let it go and let her go unpunished so as to avoid the attention and drama. But if it were me, I would definitely post it with any sort of proof so as to protect my friends and acquaintances or even strangers from being tricked like this again. Considering she had friends with her, it's clear this is something she does often. She doesn't deserve your mercy. She deserves repercussions. You are simply deciding if she receives it now or later.",

Pretty girls come up to you and pretend to be interested, they eventually invite you back to a tea house they know and you get stuck with a huge bill.

We hit a local pub, got some drinks, burgers and fries. While I was in the restroom, they took off and left me with the bill.  I knew the bartender, fortunately, and explained what happened.  He called the police on them, and I gave the police their names, last known home addresses, as well as the make, model, and license plate of the car(had to have this information for the guest parking at the apartment complex).  I guess they thought I wouldn't rat them out.  They were found at another bar by the police, trying to dine/drink and dash there, too.  Their parents bailed them out, and charges were eventually dropped as their parents paid triple for the bills at the pub and bar.",

I ended up feeling unwell, so I decided to leave early, my brother sees I'm leaving, he now decides he wants to leave. So we end up getting a taxi home. Brother does a runner, straight into house, I'm left to pay the fair, told our mum the next day and she made him pay me back. 17 years later and he still hasn't changed. He's never brought anyone a round of drinks but is quite happy to except a drink if someone else brought it.",

Various people from the group get drinks throughout the night from the bartender. At the end OP is the only one left, with neither side with a way to prove who ordered what drink specifically. \n\nI mean, this is why bars usually make you secure a tab with a card. Otherwise you could come in as a group, rack up a $1000 bar tab, everyone but the cardholder leaves, and the cardholder comes up and goes \u201cyeah I was the DD, I was just drinking pop all night.\u201d\n\nSo yes, at this point you are beyond the UCC.",

For every person with an ASD diagnosis there will be many people in their families with some traits.  Anxiety, OCD, oppositional defiance (I don't think it ends after childhood) seem to be like building blocks for ASD and the more fully pronounced personality disorders.  I wonder if ASD and the PDs will prove to be the same thing, differing only by degrees, components and sometimes gender.\n\nYour story gave me a creepy feelings because I've been looking back at my life and the people I knew back in the day, viewing it through the lens of what I know now.   Also, I know what it's like to be cruising along, something random happens, then you slowly realize other people were treating you like a joke or a target... not cool.  I hope you keep yourself open and easy - I think it's the best way to live even though you will strike a few users etc along the way.  \n\n(end random rant)  Good luck!",

I guess they were rehearsing for a show and went out to the diner after. Everyone got food and drink to varying degrees. Nothing crazy. Large group of about 15 people. As people got up, they were throwing in money for their meal and looking at the check. \"I owe $15, so here's $20\" type of things. Thought nothing of it until we went to pay the bill and we were like $60 short. Well beyond a single person, and I know money was never within reach of anyone who could have pocketed some of it. That means MULTIPLE people in his shit group of friends, who I only met for the first time that night, underpaid significantly. We were both college kids and didn't have the money readily available. We came up with a way to pay for it between credit cards and all the cash we had, left a nice tip for the waitress and I asked for a copy of the bill. I asked my friend to give me the info for the people in the group and I would go find them and figure it out. I was super pissed. Accidents happen and people sometimes forget they had an extra drink, or an appetizer, but this was just too much. Ultimately, he wouldn't give me any of their info. None of them were memorable to me to try to find after the play or rehearsals. So, I just chalked it up as an L and make sure I'm never the last person sitting at a table.",

Spending the little money you do have on things like beer, going out, etc. is keeping you down financially. There are plenty of entertaining and fun things to do at home that are much cheaper, and will allow you to end up in a place someday where you may be able to afford to pay everyone's meal.

In no world am I obligated to purchase the things they have requested, consumed, used, and then left for without paying. Not to mention that the restaurant is WAY more financially situated to eat a loss like that than most people dining there are. Not to mention I am sure it does not happen often. For all those reasons, I am sorry, but I will not be paying for others food or purchases if they decide to dine and dash. That is not my responsibility and I did not approve or agree to that, I am also not the one stealing or in the wrong as I will pay for everything I have ordered and eaten.  \nThink about all the times you dine out with groups or people you don't know, and you are telling me YOU have to pay THEIR tab if they decide to leave. Even though you ordered none of it and consumed none of it? That's like choosing a random person sitting in the restaurant to pay for the guy who dined and dashed while they were there because they watched them walk out. I have no power over them.

The second red flag should have been that you have a girlfriend and another girl is hitting you up. I'm surprised you're girlfriend wasn't like WTF mate!?\n\nI'll give you an example of an old friend situation: I am 35, and I've known my best friend since we were 4/5. He and I didn't always stay in contact and had a few times where it was years we didn't hang out or talk. Now if we didn't stay in contact for 10 years from now, I guarantee that if he or I contacted the other, that it would be like we never left off (trust and kinship). That is an old friend.",

Are you responsible for another table if they get up and leave and don't pay? I mean, if you went up to the bar and opened a tab under your name and then expected your friends to pay you back and they didn't, it would be different. But it doesn't sound like that is what happened.",
