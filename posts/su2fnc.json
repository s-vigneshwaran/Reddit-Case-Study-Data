In order to run a 20 year war on terror without liberals complaining, the US government wiped out 70 year old laws that regulated the media. They let the major media conglomerates expand but the trade off is they work as a propaganda front/info censor for the military.\n\nThis bullshit with the anagrams is just partisan propaganda. Take a really stupid person with a really bad hot take, then filter it online towards people who are on the other side of the political spectrum to pad their egos.\n\nIn the US, the pharma industry is absolutely in bed with the media cartel.",
