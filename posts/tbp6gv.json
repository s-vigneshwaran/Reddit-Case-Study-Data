We do have the techs that would normally cover these tasks, but I don\u2019t know how the staffing situation is in Canada but in the US it is absolute shit. It\u2019s not common for them to have more than 20-30 patients if not more. So when that happens, the nurse *has* to jump in and help or the patient suffers. There are plenty of nurses that don\u2019t mind letting the patient wait for however long, which is the issue and why I believe so many hours of tech hours should be a prerequisite for nursing school.",
