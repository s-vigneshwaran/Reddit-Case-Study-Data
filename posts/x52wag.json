Overweight, in walmart pajamas, sharing vague facebook memes about how your men are dicks or something else about #singlemomlife or #proudsinglemom... \n\nYes, pretty soon the most excitement in your life will be when the cashier is cute and smiles at you, or when you \"had to rush to your car at the gas station\" because \"some guy was cat calling you\"... when in reality, the cashier smiles at everyone, and the homeless dude probably has less issues than you.\n\nBut please, don't let anyone change your mind, you are technically an adult after all.\n\nAlso, being desperate for affection and seeking it through sexual gratification isn't attractive or trendy, it just shows you probably need to talk to a shrink.\n\nFarewell forgettable slut, enjoy your future unplanned baby, unless of course HPV beats him to your ovaries.",

I would guess you've convinced yourself the hoe phase is empowering so it doesn't cut as deep and you feel it's your choice and in your control when the thought creeps in that you're only appreciated or valuable for sex. You're possibly addicted to looks based validation, and even some of these comments saying you look like a sex worker might have a shred of what you're looking for in them just like the dysfunctional relationship I imagine you've just left.",
