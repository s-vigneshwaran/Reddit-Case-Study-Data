  "text": "TIFU by rubbing what I thought was my girlfriend\u2019s clit.\nExactly what the title says, I (29M), did what every dude fear of doing: Rubbing your girlfriend\u2019s clit and finding out it is NOT her clit.\n\nUsually I\u2019m great at finding it whenever we\u2019re going at it, but tonight was not my night, when things were getting hot and heavy, I slipped my fingers down there and did the usual. My girlfriend (26F) asked what I was rubbing and I replied, \u201cYour clit\u2026.?\u201d And in confusion she replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not feeling anything.\u201d  \n\nFor a second I was thrown off because how is she not feeling what I was rubbing for the past five minutes? So I poked what I thought was her clit and asked, \u201cYou mean this?\u201d And by doing that, whatever the fucked I poked, caused her to yell in pain, \u201cYes, that!\u201d \n\nIt turned out that above her hood was  this cyst that was the same size as her clit and that\u2019s what I was rubbing for the past 5 mins. Huge mood killer for the both of us, and now she\u2019s upset that she has this weird pimple that she didn\u2019t know of until now. I tried to comfort her but she\u2019s not wanting to listen.\n\nTL;DR Rubbed what I thought was my gf\u2019s clit, turned out to be a big cyst above it. FML\n\nEDIT: Turned out to be an ingrown hair, no I\u2019m not posting it on r/popping you nasties.\n\nEDIT 2: Since everyone is asking why she didn\u2019t feel it for a while, it wasn\u2019t that long of a time, like maybe a minute when she noticed it. Anyways, thanks for the advice, girlfriend is feeling better and it\u2019s just a laughable memory.",

Either way, it's not rocket surgery to use a razor, so you do you.\n\nEdit: also they say you don't need glasses with it, but it's UV and it's bright. Watch the videos of at home use and notice all the magenta splattering the camera... Get some UV glasses with it. And some oil/lotion crap for aftercare. There's a \"bundle\" on the page for all 3 and it's hardly a noticable different in price",

But besides that, it's hardly noticeable. Maybe a few areas will randomly feel like a light rubber band snap but that doesn't happen often for me.\n\nMind you, everyone has different pain tolerances to different stimuli and there is potential for some pretty nasty outcomes with lasers even if you do it properly. Some people have increased hair growth, some people have more ingrown hairs. I'm not sure if I'm normal or lucky but I'd suggest looking into it.\n\nAlso it mainly works for light skin and dark brown/black hair. Both of which I have lol",

Clean the blades after every pass, then go over it all again until it's as smooth as you can get it. Rinse with Luke warm water, pat dry with a clean towel.\n\nOnce dry, pat with rubbing alcohol to help with bacteria introduced while shaving. Die for a few minutes. Then go over the entire area with unscented (and preferably aluminum free) antiperspirant to kinda create a moisture barrier.\n\nTime consuming as fuuuuuck but it can be done!",

Safety razors (or straight if your balls are so big that they can keep the scrotum pulled tight) don't have such a high chance of ingrowns as they only cut skin level but the cartridge razors and especially disposables WILL cause ingrowns because they don't just cut but also pull on the hair. So instead of cutting skin level they tug with the first blade and cut the pulled out hair, ending in a below skin surface cut which gets ingrown. But I gotta give it to them, they make for a smoother shave down there (they don't stand a chance on the face)\n\nBut I imagine safety razors can be quite intimidating, especially for women with the folds and everything instead of one pole sticking out that you can move",

If it doesn't ever get knocked loose, it can easily grow into the skin from there.  Another factor that makes it likely is that you are shaving closer by going against the grain, so not only are you pushing the stubble in to make it more likely to catch, cutting it that short makes it easier to get completely trapped under the skin.",

I would say that any time you shave any part of your body you want to keep that area real clean and don\u2019t have any constrictive fabric that interferes with the hairs growing back out.\n\nTo go above and beyond you can use a salicylic acid soap on the area. Basically Neutrogena. That will clean out any dead skin cells that might clog your pores and block the hairs.\n\nThat might dry your skin a lot so a moisturizer would be good to use after.\n\nDefinitely shower as soon after sex as possible to be on the safe side.\n\nBasically, if you ever do develop problems these are steps you can use to prevent them in the future.",

Don't try to make the razor do something it's not meant for. \n\nI also do it in the shower and bring a little plastic cup. Every other swipe, rinse the razor in the cup of water. Never use an old razor (true for any kind of shaving). \n\nStrop the razor after every use (this is true for your face as well.) You can make a strop with an old belt or cut a length from some jeans, but your forearm will do in a pinch. Just push the razor firmly against your arm and swipe four times. Not like you're shaving your arm, but with the blades. This gives them a minor \"alignment\", removes stray hairs and also helps pull water out of them. They will last literally 10x longer if you get in the habit of doing this and save you a lot of $$$.",

Women's genitals vary wildly and this I thought had gotten to the point of being common knowledge. The fact that you chose to use \"women\" and \"definitely\" as your first sentence as opposed to \"most women, many women, some women, myself etc, rubs me the wrong way (heh heh heh).   \n\nTMI but I'm on the opposite end of the bell curve as you are and I don't see mine on a daily basis not masturbate on a daily basis. Mine is also pretty small becuase again clits come in al different sizes and hood coverage. So yeah some women are reading this thinking OPs gf was ignoring something pea-marble sized whereas others are imagining it would be more like rice grain that's recessed into some flaps. \n\n\nI also have had ingrown hairs/other cysts pop up down there pretty much over night so I can personally see how a series of events could lead to this even if they don't seem very probable. I get the impression that some people maybe underestimate how quickly cycst can form and blow up and are assuming she must've not noticed this for days or more which just isn't necessarily the case\n\n I'm not even fat either which I'm sure many are going to assume after reading this. Bodies be different. Also had a friend in college convinced her clit was actually urethra.... Sooo yeah I get a little ornery about stigma, misinformation, and lack of information when it comes to this.",

If you're doing foreplay, you sitting there and just rubbing her shit is pretty much the equivalent of her giving you a clumsy dry handjob. It's boring and there are much more effective ways to go about getting in the mood unless you're an inexperienced teenager.\n\nI'm sorry, but this whole story reeks of a 14 year old trying to pretend he gets laid.",

It shifts her focus back to a happy memory and let\u2019s that initial embarrassment and anxiety simmer away.",

She also had a nice pair of 36DDDs. She's playing little spoon during out interaction and while I'm kissing the back of her neck, I decided to round second. My hand went up her shirt and I'm squeezing, playing, and rubbing a chunk of flesh that I thought was her breast. After a few minutes, she laughed and asked what I was doing. Well, what I thought was her breast ended up being part of her stomach. She spent the next 2 hours locked in her room crying while I was profusely trying to apologize to the door. Lessons learned, I guess. Best thing you can do OP is looking back on it, laugh. Shit happens.",
