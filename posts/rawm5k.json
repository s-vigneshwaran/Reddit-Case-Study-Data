You find a politician who raped or sexuall harrassed women in his office. You *have* to get rid of him or you're telling those women you never actually cared about their issues.\n\nBecause of the values the Left holds, Leftists need to embody them. It's not just propaganda that makes us eat each other.\n\nThe right is totally different. It has a veneer of morality, of Christian Ethics, but that's pretty fundamentalist. There's a Calvanist \"if you do it, it's God's will\" sort of thing. So you can overlook all the bad - that's baked in. At heart, the Right is fixated on individual success - morals don't reallly apply. They don't have to turn on each other. Trump really exemplifies this. They only turn on someone who is a loser. Trump has managed to fail upwards, his \"losses\" rarely stick.",

(Social Democrats(7), Restoration party(2), Pirate Party(2) and Left Green Alliance(1))\n\nThey vary from left to right across the middle, but are all largely progressive and modernist. If you are disappointed with one of them and want to punish that party, you can vote for another that still has similar overarching goals, but a different focus, different culture, different individuals. If enough people do that, the balance of power within the coalition will change. The same coalition with 3 Social Democrats and 4 Pirates, 3 Restoration Partiers and 2 Left Greens would pursue maybe largely the same policy goals, but with a very different balance, different focus and probably a different Mayor.\n\nIf there is enough of a backlash against one party, they might even be dropped out of the coalition after an election, if the others are strong enough to form a majority without them\n\nTo most disaffected voters of a progressive party, this would be a far more appealing way to punish a party that they still agree with in the big picture, but think has made too many mistakes, become too comfortable or lost its way, than to lead to power a right wing conservative party, or a populist alt-right party.\n\nIn some of our neighboring countries, they even forego solid majority coalitions, and minority governments and municipalities are the norm, where ad hoc agreements, or alliances over the budget and the chief executive don't extend to having to be allied on all policy issues.\n\nThe 'price' we pay is that small parties can become disproportionately influential by leveraging their position of being able to lead to power either of two large parties. But I would say that cost outweighs the gain of not having the extreme polarization of a two party system.",

Many people voted for Democrats not out of support for them, but out of a lack of support for the alternative. In order to keep that going, they pretty much need to have a perfect record. Republicans don't have that problem because they are a party developed around the idea of falling in line.",

Democratic voters are disappointed with the Democrats and they can risk losing the next election cycle when they fail to live up to the promises they made on the campaign trail, especially when they make no attempt to live up to them.\n\nRepublicans also have to do this. If they don't appeal to their voters they will lose their election. The difference is that their voters want republicans who will \"shit themself and smear it all over the walls\". Destroying our democracy is popular for them. A moderate, level headed republican that fails to harm the right amount of minorities will face the same disappointment that we are now leveling at Biden.",
