In all likelihood, *you don\u2019t.*\n\nYou might actually have a meaningful conversation with an anti-feminist if you didn\u2019t assume anti-feminism is an ideology unto itself; where feminists cry \u201cpatriarchy\u201d, anti-feminists don\u2019t cry \u201cmatriarchy\u201d \u2014 we just call out feminist patriarchy as bullshit, lol.\n\nI\u2019ve tried having civil conversations with feminists for years but you folks never come to the table with anything resembling intellectual honesty. So I\u2019m tired of it, I\u2019m tired of you, and I\u2019m tired of all your comrades.\n\nPeople and society were here first; and feminism second. If you want any of us to take your rhetoric seriously then you better be prepared to back it up. \u201cPatriarchy\u201d is not some basic truth that feminism pretends, and until you substantiate and prove it nothing else born of feminist ideology matters.",
