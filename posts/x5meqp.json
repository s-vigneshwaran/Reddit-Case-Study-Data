Law Firm delivered cease and desist notices to four North Texas school districts on Friday morning.\nhttps://nordot.app/938969800603320320?c=592622757532812385\n\nThe Austin-based Kaplan Law Firm delivered cease and desist notices to four North Texas school districts on Friday morning requesting that they remove all non-compliant \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d signs from their schools.\n\nThe firm represents a group of concerned parents from the Carroll, Mansfield, Keller and Grapevine-Colleyville school districts, who allege that a Texas law requiring schools to display \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d signs that are donated pushes Christian theology and is a violation of their students\u2019 First Amendment rights.\n\n\u201cOur public schools must be places that affirm all students regardless of race or ethnicity, religion, gender identity or sexual orientation,\u201d the parents said in a joint statement. \u201cOur schools cannot be places that prioritize a singular religious ideology nor can they become political battlegrounds.\u201d",

The justices who write these opinions are undeniably engaged in making law beyond applying it. The entire body of law on freedom of speech was created by the Supreme Court. The First Amendment itself declares, \u201cCongress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or of the press.\u201d  \n>  \n>The text seems clear but reading it alone fails to capture the scope of the provision. We know, because the Supreme Court has told us, that no law does not actually mean no law. The rules of the First Amendment are not limited to Congress. They apply to the executive branch and to state and local governments as well. Further, the First Amendment also extends its protective reach since it guards against government censorship of books, movies, artwork, and several other forms of free speech.  \n>  \n>These deviations from the text of the First Amendment and the scope of free speech beyond its narrow words were set by judicial decisions. The First Amendment prohibition of censorship prior to publication that was invoked in the Pentagon Papers case was a product of judicial law, along with symbolic speech to let a student to wear a black armband in protest of the Vietnam War, and the ban on vague enactments which secured the free speech rights for civil rights marchers in Alabama.  \n>  \n>The Supreme Court made law for each of these legal doctrines. The claim that judges should not make law rests on the assertion that such authority is a license for broad policy and unrestrained influence. But judges are not unrestrained. These restraints come from traditions in the judicial process. They come from the obligation to defend decisions in public opinions, the need to rest decisions on careful conclusions based on evidence, and the rule that decisions reflect outcomes drawn from legal principles. Respect for judicial precedent also offers an influence of restraint.",

It's a very Christian tactic to ignore reality in favor of a story you want to tell. The fact is America absolutely started with the idea of allow religious ethnostates within the Republic. The federal government was the one banned from religious lawmaking. \n\nIn order to fight against misinformation, which is the claim you have against Christians saying America was founded as a Christian nation, they are factually correct when you look at reality and history. Selective incorporation of religious rights has taken a long time, and they mostly apply to Christian religions and framework. \n\nIf we want a better, more secular world, we have to confront reality instead of fabricate selective quotes to argue that the founders wanted freedom for all. That is objectively false. Freedom for all is correct and just, no need for dragging up selective bullshit quotes from founders to justify freedom for all.

Baltimore, the Supreme Court ruled that the Bill of Rights didn't apply to the states. The national government had to honor those rights, but state and local governments didn't. If the mayor of a city didn't like a particular newspaper, nothing in the Constitution said that he couldn't order the police to shut it down. If the police wanted to bust into someone's house for no good reason, nothing in the Constitution said they couldn't. Nothing in the Constitution said that states couldn't engage in cruel and unusual punishments, or that they had to give criminal defendants a fair trial.\"\n\nI would highly suggest informing yourself before spouting this misinformation. The bill of rights does not apply to the states unless the right in question has been selectively incorporated by SCOTUS. The founding fathers only wanted to limit the federal government because they were terrified of a centralized government. They felt like the People would be able to hold the States accountable because the state government is closer to people than the federal government. They felt like the people would address religious bias in laws to be what the People want. They never limited the states' ability to religiously or ethnically discriminate",

The argument that the founders strived for religious freedoms and freedom from religion is just false. You have to understand the problem and the reality of our history if we are to move forward. Lies about these old dead guys arguing for all freedoms and what not is dumb on its face. The founders are only useful for the conservative argument that Christianity was enforced in reality in many states through about the first half of our Republic. Christians are making a factual argument here and trying to hold founders up on a pedestal saying they believed in freedom from religion is a straight up lie. Don't be intellectually dishonest like the Christians.",

I really wish more people could stop reading misinformation and apply critical thinking to this notion and realize they\u2019re not losing rights but rather people are gaining equal rights. However, I know that many are incapable of critical thinking and self reflection and others are just willfully ignorant and arrogant asshats that want to oppress any non white christian nationalist fascist. \n\n\nThe thing about these signs to me is that idgaf what deity you believe in or if you\u2019re atheist or agnostic cuz it\u2019s plain and simple that religion doesn\u2019t belong in public schools otherwise why tf would we have catholic and other Christian schools that are separate? Makes zero sense logically and anyone that can\u2019t see that doesn\u2019t understand jack shit about why tf this country was founded in the first place. I recall in history class learning about freedom to practice any religion as being a cornerstone of the reason we moved to North America.\n\n\nLastly I like to live by the idea that religion is like a penis it\u2019s ok to have one and be proud of it but it\u2019s not ok if you go around jamming it down peoples throats that is Fucking evil and disgusting to force shit on kids.",

That's not a good picture to paint of him and it wouldn't surprise me if he found that insulting as Hell (you know if he was real). Schools don't teach any direct Anti-God stuff. They generally don't bring him up at all which is the way we should all want it. If I believed in God I wouldn't want some random person's perspective of God influencing my kid at all. People warp their belief in him to their liking. I had a teacher who believed she was tree in her past life and God made her a human cause she was such a honorable tree (she claimed to be Christian even though Christianity doesn't involve reincarnation). Do you want people teaching your kid that sort of ridiculousness about God or should they be taught by the church? Schools should teach empirical things. There is nothing empirical about believing in God. Everything kids are taught in school an expert in that field should be able to say \"yes, that's generally correct\".",

It is \"merely\" an agreed doctrine decided upon BY THE SUPREME COURT ITSELF as an interpretation of the 1st Amendment, which we have upheld for generations without feeling the need to make it into a law. [https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/885/establishment-clause-separation-of-church-and-state](https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/885/establishment-clause-separation-of-church-and-state)\n\nSo now, all the Supreme Court need do is reverse the earlier court decision with a new interpretation, exactly like they recently did with *Roe v. Wade*.\n\nFrom now on, we'd better have the politicians go back and make all of our surviving rights into clearly worded and explicit rights BY LAW\u2014or we won't have any left! (Assuming the country survives long enough to start the process.)\n\n\\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT 1: Those who foolishly still think that the 1st Amendment by ITSELF is enough to protect your rights\u2014you're forgetting who gets to (re-) interpret what those Constitutional words MEAN. And it's not you, it's the SCOTUS.\n\nThat's exactly what I explained above, and you need to pull your heads out of your asses. Argue all you wish in the comments below, but it doesn't change the facts. (No, I'm not arguing with you one at a fucking time, I have a life)\n\nEDIT 2, to you further idiots who think I'm arguing we give up completely: Did any of you fucking READ the above? The last paragraph before EDIT 1, in particular. I told you what we need to do. If you want to stop religion from a complete takeover, you need to have that one done NOW.",

But the supreme court won't rule that. \n\nThe other path people could *possibly* go down is that the national motto is likely a type of nationally recognized political speech. you can't force a government organization to display one type of political speech without forcing them to display all political speech. Like when police stations start displaying thin blue line stuff out in their public lobbies. Pretty sure \"legally\" they are required to also display other political speech, even if the board that over sees the police department requires that speech to be displayed. \n\nAnother form political speech imo is the photo of a president. So submit a photo of the president to be displayed, and when they reject it sue the school and the state based on that they are forcing political speech of a particular type and rejecting all others.",

They ruled that he had no standing to bring the case in the first place, and as such bypassed the question completely.",

He apologized for his treatment of women and seems to have changed his ways.  God has a history of gross misogyny.  At least one of his 10 commandments treats women as property.  God is unrepentant.  At best he can be said to have moved from treating women as property in the Old Testament to only treating them as subservient to men in the New Testament.  God still has a long way to go according to his last public statement on the issue of women's rights.  \n* Biden ordered the death of Ayman al-Zawahiri.  I think that is the only death he has ordered.  Jehovah has a much higher death toll, including multiple examples of genocide.\n* Biden mourns the death of his son.  God celebrates the death of his, and apparently even planned it.",

So if you have complaints about them, you should take them to a more topical subreddit. Surely, you're not claiming that an r/atheism user secretly runs OANN or Fox News?",
