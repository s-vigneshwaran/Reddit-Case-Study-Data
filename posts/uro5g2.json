  "text": "TIFU by causing abrupt chaos on a Zoom meeting.\nBackground: I've been sick for a week or so with a wicked cough. I also have asthma, so it's rough. I'm going to the doctor later today, but in the meantime had to attend a Zoom meeting this morning.\n\nI was in this Zoom meeting with about 15 other people when I unmuted to ask a question. I leaned back in my chair to really give off the beard-stroking academic vibe, and I heard a crack as some piece in my old AF Ikea desk chair exploded and the chair back went all the way backwards. And so did I.\n\nBoth of my cats, situated nicely under the computer monitors on my desk, did what cats do when there's an unexpected noise and completely lost their noodles. In classic kitty form, they destroyed everything in their path, knocking my mug off the desk and onto the floor, shattering it.\n\nMeanwhile, I lay on the floor on my back having a huge coughing fit. I untangled myself from my chair and headphone wires and got up to go grab my inhaler. In the process, I stepped on some pieces from the shattered mug with my bare feet. I let out another round of cough-laden expletives as I walked away.\n\nA few minutes later, I had my shit sorted out and came back to my desk and keeping with the theme of pandemic-related TIFU posts, I realized I had been unmuted the whole time and with my video on. Apparently my colleagues had just spent that time conjecturing on whether I had left my earthly body behind or what.\n\nMinus 5 points professionalism for me, plus 10 points hilarity.\n\nTLDR - unmuted on Zoom, chaos ensued.\n\nedit: removed cat tax so my fuzzballs don't dox me",

OP just randomly switched the topic to China, with no apparent reason.\n\nThat person literally did what you are accusing me of, which is what I complained about. So close, yet so far\n\nOn top of that, you refuted both of your own claims. Bravo!",

When you set it up search in YouTube for videos that tell you how you should sit ergonomically so you take full advantage of the chair.\n\nAlso, if you have your monitors at a low level you will tend to lean forwards to see the screen (not using the headrest or keeping a good posture), which can lead to neck pain in the long term. You can solve this with a dual hydraulic monitor arm (like this one https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oPdIcALXL._AC_SL1500_.jpg ). With this you can set your monitors at the level of your eyes while leaning back on the chair, so you keep a better posture while working. This arms also free a lot of space on your desk, which is a nice extra plus.",

It feels like luxurious leather and has arch support & adjustable height. There is a paddle to lock the chair straight up or allow it to recline. \n\nIf I can sit cross legged, this seat is big enough for a much beefier person. Lol.

At the same time my feet hit my desk- it didn\u2019t knock over but the things on top went flying. I hit the ground and the classroom goes silent, my buddy looking down at me with a joyful \u201cyou\u2019re gonna get it\u201d face- right then, in that moment of dead silence, I unexpectedly ripped a powerful loud fart as I lay on my back with my feet in the air. With the attention of my whole class! My buddy\u2019s face went into an even more gleeful expression as our teacher, an older Peruvian lady, said \u201cMr Mat-chow, desk in the hallway for the remainder of the day.\u201d She loved me for the most part.
