  "text": "TIFU by saying that my neighbors daughters are hot\nI (M, 33) live in Quebec, Canada. Here the official language is French, but almost everyone speaks English too.\n\nThe other day I was shoveling snow on my driveway and my neighbor (F ~35) was there too, removing snow from her car.\n\nWe share a driveway and we are very friendly. We always help each other and exchange gifts. I really love having them as neighbors.\n\nTheir family configuration is: mother, two daughters, one son and a father. But dad and mom are divorced. So on this day I finally met the father.\n\nSo he approached me talking in French, and I kinda can speak French, so I tried to maintain the conversation in French to be respectful. He said \"my daughters said you are a very good neighbor (mes filles m'on dit que tu est un tr\u00e8s bon voisin)\" or something along these lines. \n\nI replied: merci! Elles sont tr\u00e8s bonnes aussi !\nI thought that meant \"thank you, they are very good too!\n\nAgain, my French is very limited. \n\nThat actually means \"yes, they are very hot too\"\nOr \"very good to f*ck\"\n\nHe started speaking English, and we had a pleasant conversation.\n\nWeeks later I watch a video about the worst mistakes you can make in French. This was #1.\n\nSo now I know that I said to a Muslim father that they daughters and ex wife are hot.\n\nTL;DR: my French speaking skills suck and I said to a man that his ex-wife and daughters are hot when I'm trying to say that they are very good (elles sont tr\u00e8s bonnes, if you speak any French).\n\nEDIT 1: some people from Quebec sent me messages saying that this is a \"France french\" expression (or metropolitan french). That is a relief, but not that much. Because I guess they learnt French from France, because they are from Lebanon.",

For example, they had been transliterating the name Vesuvius as \u039f\u03c5\u03b5\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (Wesuwion). \n\nAfter Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, Greek writers spelled it \u0392\u03ad\u03c3\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (\u03b2es\u03b2ion). This shows not only the change in how the V was pronounced (\u03b2 being a bilabial voiced fricative), but that the second vowel in the volcano's name was no longer pronounced, and the stress had shifted to the first syllable (the accent shift might have been the cause for dropping an now unstressed vowel).",

So some Native Speakers will speak or write better than some non native speakers, and not mess up as much, and for some it will be the other way around.\n\nI put some for a reason, please make sure to note what adjectives I used. I am in no way implying either side is the norm 100% of the time. :) Hope everyone has a good day. ^ - ^\n\nEdit2: Why wont it let me do my ^ - ^ smiley face ;-;",

The Celts arrived in Britain around 1000BC (Athens & Sparta had already been founded, the Pyramids built, and humans were solidly in the Iron Age), but the island was already heavily populated by that time. There's little evidence of the original pre-Celtic language today, but it's presumed to be something akin to the Basque language. The Celts were an Indo-European people who migrated in from the east. Like the Basque, the pre-Celtic Britons were largely descended from people who had settled the region during the Neolithic. Pictish was long thought to be the last remaining stronghold of the pre-Celtic British languages, but even that is now generally considered to be some sort of hybridization that was predominantly Celtic. The differences between the Gaelic and Bythonic Celtic languages, and the Celtic languages of mainland Europe, are assumed to be due to the influence of the pre-existing language. \n\nThe name \"English\" comes from the invading Angles, who called the language Anglisc. The Anglisc language replaced the Celtic languages across much of Britain, but not before hybridizing and adopting many traits of those earlier languages. Old English was primarily Germanic, but with Brythonic influence. Words like \"bog\", \"pet\", \"hog\" and even \"ass\" come from the pre-Anglo-Saxon languages.",

We straight up lifted our most of our language from a wide variety of sources and it simplified our language compared to old English (which is funny considering the various complaints about English being complicated in this thread).  We lost multiple letters from our alphabet like \u00d0, \u00de, \u00c6, \u01bf, \u00f0 and accented letters (e.g \u00d3).",

The average Japanese speaker memorizes about 9000 of them and has to look up others all the time.\n\nWhen I pointed out that those unique English rules are basically our Kanji, it clicked for her and she stopped complaining (as much ;)).",

Essentially, it'll always be subject+verb+object+complement. The verb for each tense only has, at most, two conjugational forms. Compare that to Spanish and French, where each tense has a specific verb form for each subject. Meaning you need to learn six different forms of each verb (they follow patterns, but it's still tough) for pretty much each tense.  For example, I went to the store, and if you ever change the subject to second, third, plural or singular, it'll always be went. In Spanish, it would be yo fui, tu fuiste, usted/el/ella fue, nosotros fuimos, vosotros fuisteis, ustedes/ellos/ellas fueron. And that applies to every verb. \n\nThe toughest part of English is its phonetic component, since you never know how each word is pronounced until you've heard it. There are patterns that sometimes work, like when there are two consonants after a vowel, the vowel often is pronounced differently. However, these patterns don't always apply.",

Sometimes with words that come from Greek or Latin (wich used many Greek words) there is a problem with the accents, for example:\nMetonimia (metonomy) can be pronounced as meton\u00ecmia or metonim\u00eca\nOdisseo (Odysseus) can be pronounced as Od\u00ecsseo or Odiss\u00e8o.\nThe fun fact is that are both \"correct\"as long as you are consistent with it, and if somebody points out that the accent is incorrect you can respond that you're just using the other pronunciation.\nTo be precise I must say that the Roman pronunciation is \"more correct\" but the Greek is still accepted.\nAnyway, for common words like \u00abs\u00e9dia\u00bb (Chair) you don't have all this problems",

It is a little odd because of how English was formed and developed from a few root languages, and so it has a few different paradigms of how words work all together. It also has a crap ton of words.\n\nBut it also dropped a lot of the more complicated aspects of inflection. This results in some inconsistencies, (Like how some words are gendered, by actual gender for some reason, but most are not.) but it overall reduces the complexity of the language. We make up for by using more complicated sentences to cover the gaps.\n\nFor example, the colloquialism \"y'all\" exists to fill the apparent lack of a second person plural personal pronoun. Technically in English we have one, but it is just \"You.\" Due to some accident of language our plural and singular second personal personal pronouns are identical, which is super confusing if you are trying to designate a person out of a group. So people started modifying it to \"You all\" then \"Y'all.\" \n\nAnyway, there are languages with more words, more rules, more exceptions to those rules, and significantly more complex grammar. Over time those languages also drop or shift sounds, tones and inflections to make words easier to say, but this causes constant rule breaking. And the more complex the grammar, the more confusing they get. You will have these huge structures of like 30-120+ different inflections for a single verb, and each verb will have multiple random exceptions where it breaks the pattern, but it always does so inconsistently.",

And when our teacher read Hermione's name about half the class started saying that she was saying it wrong and that it was \"Her-me-own\", including me lol.\n\nThey said they actually know someone with that name and told us they were saying it correctly. And since then, especially since the movies, I've accepted the right way to say it. \n\nBut even looking at the origin of the name it still doesn't seem right. It's based off the Greek deity Hermes (Her-mees). The \"one\" at the end was easier to accept as \"Oh-nee\" as I was used to other Greek names like Persephone. But then I was just thinking her name should be \"Her-mee-oh-nee\" lol.",

People were pronouncing the \"t\" in often all the way back when \"oft\" was a real word in common usage. There was, at least somewhat, a class distinction, but that has certainly gone away.",

That and the whole transposition of the L's and R's thing happens a bit. And I told her to avoid saying \"sheet\" as in: 'Can you hand me that sheet of paper' cause it sounds exactly like shit.\n\nBut yeah, she wants me to correct her and I try to be as kind as possible (sometimes it's humorous, sue me) and I think that matters the most, that I'm not making fun of her.",

But when talking about \"to insert\" you to somebody, I'm sure that you'd admit it sounds wrong even in English.\n\nIt can also be used for books and topics of conversation, as in to give original context. But we talk more about \"doing an introduction\" than \"to introduce/insert someone to a topic\".\n\nFor teacher to tell people to say that is definitely wrong. It's a massive false friend. It's a little bit like asking to translate \"eventually\" by \"\u00e9ventuellement\" which have actually opposite meanings, except on top of that \"to insert someone to somebody\" has huge sexual connotation.\n\nNot blaming you, just the teachers.\nNobody that doesn't have enough English knowledge would understand really what you mean.\nThe real French word is indeed pr\u00e9senter, but if it's too weird for young student, it's by far better to tell them not to try and translate the sentence at all than to say \"introduire\".

Very rare to use the expression of someone being \"bonne\" in this way.  \nThis confusion could come up in writing, but in person, I can't see him interpreting your comment wrong, because if you wanted to actually convey that meaning, you'd be giving a specific look at the same time, one that says \"if you get what I mean\" (an eyebrow raise, for example).  \n\n\nBilingual people can tell exactly what you're trying to say, and we don't specifically try to interpret your wording in a bad way ;)\n\n  \nDon't be too embarrassed, Qc francophones are very used to awkward phrasings from non-native french speakers, and if english is your first language, he knows exactly what you were trying to say, since he could tell from your accent that you were using a word-for-word process of mental translation, and that you meant good in the english sense.  \n\n\nIf he switched to english, it was just because he felt your struggle, and wanted to make the convo easier on you, not because you necessarily said a weird thing. If you want to practice french in bilingual areas of Qc, you kinda have to specify to people that you want to practice, but if the goal is to communicate efficiently, we switch.",

Well this one has tge same issue as its english counterpart, I wonder if its the Americans or the French who first took its meaning to a new level.\n\n\"Baiser\" either means to kiss or to f*ck depending on if you use it as a verb or as a noun.\n\nAnd the list goes on. Even native french speakers can do the mistake, and they will laugh about it so i doubt the father will get offended by it.\n\nAs a side note those videos are clickbait, \"never say that  to a french person\" but what they don't tell you is that french natives know how confusing their language is so they will probably get the message and either laugh about it or ignore the mistake.",

Now depending where you live, it could have several meanings.\n\nIn Qu\u00e9bec, using \"bonne(s)\" the way you did is not a mistake at all. It just means \"good\", like \"being good at something\". During my first years in Qu\u00e9bec, I used to be embarrased when Quebecers were saying about a girl that she was \"bonne\", until I understood they meant absolulty nothing else but \"she was good doing things\"\n\nIn France, 90% of the time it also means \"being good at\". It could be considered as \"hot\", depending the context and the people you're talking to about a girl you've seen, but it's NOT a good way to describe a girl AT ALL, like, NEVER EVER say that to your French girlfriend or about her friends.\n\nIf a non-French speaking uses it, we understand that it means \"good\", there's no issue with that.\n\nSo, don't worry, youy didn't insult his daughters :)",

If she has visitors coming, is about to go to work, or just doesn't want to smell smoke we skip it or wait; no big deal.\n\nOne such occasion J's brother was visiting and had been trying out some short French phrases to learn better pronunciation and conversation. So he asks her in French, \"Can we please have a pipe?\" (une pipe s'il vous plait). She looks at him in horror then embarrassment shaking her head laughing says, \"No, no, no, no, no. That's not the phrase to use.\" Gave him the correct phrase containing \"fumeur\" (smoking) or something like that, and said it was ok to have a pipe.\n\nThat was the day we learned \"une pipe\" is French slang for a blowjob. My buddy accidentally asked his sister-in-law for \"a blowjob please\".",

It\u2019s sound pretty weird because it\u2019s a bit old imo and, well, also because of the ambiguity of \"bonne\" so people almost don\u2019t use it anymore.\n\nHowever, there is also the tone you\u2019re using to take in count and if it\u2019s obvious you are not comfortable with french, well nobody will think you said \"hot\", but certainly think you made a mistake or you are using strangely formal french because you learned it like this.",

Context would be for example: did you see the latest Batman film with Zoe Kravits in it? Yes she is 'bonne'. Or if you were to see a girl at a party you'd say 'damn elle est bonne, I want to fuck her.

Like straight from across the border can't speak English at all Mexican, so these phones were very popular for the demographic because they could chat with people back home. In my high school you had to take one year of foreign language to graduate, so I picked spanish for whatever reason. It was a very, very basic class. Like hola donde esta el bano y biblioteca level. \n\nAnyways about 6 dudes that couldn't speak a lick of English came in decked out in fancy cowboy boots and hats, and crazy belt buckles, and asked me if I spoke Spanish. \n\nI meant to say 'a little, but it's pretty bad', and they just all looked at me like I was mental then walked out. I realized I actually said something along the lines of 'you're little but why are you so bad?\" lol.

Most of the places we went had French menus. Not wanting to look like a typical American tourist and inconvenience our servers with lots of stupid questions, I relied pretty heavily on Google translate. \n\nOn our last night in Montreal, I was ready for something easier, so we decided to get pizza. We found a really cool little place that looked a lot like any pizza place you\u2019d find in NYC or Chicago, the type of place with red and white checkered tablecloths and Parmesan cheese shakers on the table. \n\nWhen we sat down, the server handed us menus and left after taking our drink order. We opened up the menu, and it was in French. Whatever, I figured I\u2019d just open up Google translate like I\u2019d been doing for the last week. After a few minutes, the guy came back with our drinks, and asked if we knew what we wanted. I told him that I was just trying to figure it out, but it was going to be a minute because we didn\u2019t speak French. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cdo you guys need English menus? Most places here have both.\u201d\n\nMan, did I feel like a real fucking dummy.",
