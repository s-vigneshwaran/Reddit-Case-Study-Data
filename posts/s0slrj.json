  "text": "TIFU by saving my neighbors life\nFor starters this literally just happened ten minutes ago, and be ready to buckle up because boy is this one long.\n\nSo, my fiance\u00e9 (F29) and I (M30) have lived in our current apartment for 8 months and have had a pretty decent experience overall. It would be perfect if it wasn't for the neighbors that moved in about four months ago. Just to set the stage for what we have been going through, these neighbors throw parties that start at 4:00 am and end at 2:00 pm all the time and when they aren't having their parties they are just blaring music loud enough to make Hellen Keller ask them to STFU all day long. Both my fianc\u00e9 and I work from home, so this can get incredibly annoying, but nevertheless we solider on. \n\nWhich brings us to today. Today I noticed from my office that there is a persistent beeping. After about five minutes I go to the living room and ask my fianc\u00e9 if that was our neighbors smoke detector. She said that she thinks so, so I went to investigate.\n\nI go out in the hall and notice that the sound is coming from their apartment, but I don't smell any smoke and the door is cold to the touch. So I figure they have it under control and go back to my apartment to continue working. About twenty minutes later I notice it is still going off (and by this point my dog is freaking the fuck out) so I go back to the hallway, smell smoke, and courageously bang on the door. No answer. I continue banging on the door but no one is responding.\n\nSo I do the only logical thing and call maintenance. I give maintenance man (henceforth MM) the run down on the days events and he says he'll be right over. Problem solved right? Wrong! Because this dear listeners is when the story gets fun.\n\nMM arrives, goes to the neighbors apartment, and does his maintenance thing. When no one answers he goes in and the horrid smoke detector finally stops. I am just about set to go back to my work when all of a sudden there is a knock on my door. \n\nI open it to find MM standing there on the phone telling another member of maintenance to get the police and ambulance on their way over because he thinks \"the kid next door is dead\". MM then looks at me and says \"I need you to come in here with me incase he is faking and attacks.\"\n\nNow, I have been in some fights in my youth but I am in no means someone who is prepared to duke it out with anyone holding any kind of weapon. Not to mention the fact that MM has a good 2 feet and 120 lbs. on me so if he goes down I'm all but fucked. So naturally I do the responsible thing and agree to go with MM.\n\nWe enter an apartment FILLED with smoke and I see a burnt pot on a stove covered in the foam from a fire extinguisher. Apparently a fire had started and MM put it out and opened all the windows to try to get rid of the smoke.\n\nAnd, sure enough, passed out on the floor, is one of my fucking neighbors (henceforth Fire Starter a kid I am assuming is around 23). MM proceeds to shake and nudge Fire Starter in an attempt to get a response. But this kid ain't moving folks. We're in there for at least five minutes trying to get this kid up, so eventually MM tells whoever he is on the phone with to \"get the ambulance and police over here now\".\n\nApparently, \"police\" was the magic word because Fire Start wakes the fuck up and goes agro on MM. MM takes it like a champ and proceeds to tell Fire Starter he is a dumbass and almost burning down a building is not okay. Fire Starter just keeps yelling for MM to get the fuck out (I had beyond backed out into the hall at this point). MM keeps his cool and just keeps saying \"man we just saved your life show some goddamn respect\".\n\nFire Starter then asks for MM's name so he can report him, which MM gave, then asked for my name so he can report me for trespassing. MM refused to give my name saying \"he's the only reason you're alive right now you useless shit\". To which Fire Starter grabs a kitchen knife and starts waiving it at MM. MM keeps his cool, collects his keys, and walks off all while Fire Starter chases him down the stairs being an incoherent little shit. In the meantime I have predictably retreated to my own apartment only to have Fire Starter standing outside my door screaming \"I know where you live you piece of shit\".\n\nGood times.\n\nTL;DR Dumb ass young violent neighbor passed out and caught his stove on fire, I called maintenance thereby saving his life, and now I am looking for a new place to live.\n\nUpdate: Just got done giving my statement to the police. Thank you to everyone who was asking for updates. It\u2019s for sure a fucked up tale that is far from over. I\u2019ll provide updates as I hear things.\n\nUpdate 2: There has been a cop outside the apartment building all morning. Haven\u2019t heard anything from inside today though. \n\nUpdate 3: Haven\u2019t updated for a while because I was waiting on confirmation but Fire Starter was evicted. We noticed someone moving out about a week later but didn\u2019t see who it was and yesterday noticed another couple moving in. Haven\u2019t met them yet but I also haven\u2019t heard a peep from their apartment even with them unloading. So they are already better than our last neighbor.\n\nAcknowledgement: Yes we should have called the fire department first. We didn\u2019t because this is not the first time their smoke detector has just gone off. Usually they let it beep the whole time they cook, but it has never gone off that long before.",

If we don't interact, you aren't causing problems.)\n\n2: People who caused problems (always breaking things, calling the emergency line for non-emergencies, disturbing neighbors. Crazies fall into this camp.)\n\n3: People who thought I wanted to hear about everything going on in their life, and would corner me and just not shut up until I found an excuse to leave. Most of these were 50-something women with small dogs.\n\n4: Cool folks. People who'd say hi, talk about the weather, ask how things are going. The main difference between this group and group 3 is that they talked *to* me, not *at* me.\n\nThe #1 rule for staying in camp 4 is to **never**, under **any** circumstances, tell anyone if the maintenance guy does you a favor. Don't tell your neighbors, don't leave a review online, don't tell the manager. The official stance is that we're not allowed to give any special treatment, so if you do 1 resident a favor then every resident is going to feel entitled to favors.",

When sometime bad or stupid happens in other countries, it\u2019s not really talked about much, or at least not in the US.  I think it\u2019s kind of like the Florida Man thing.  It doesn\u2019t happen in JUST Florida.  It\u2019s just that Florida has much less privacy restrictions.  So while the same things happen else where, in Florida it\u2019s allowed to be published.",

The only time the music would stop is when the males start arguing, fighting, and breaking things. I've spoken with maintenance, the office, the corporation, and police about them because they always woke me up.\n\nTurns out those guys don't even live there. They're the boyfriends of 2 females that actually rent from the place. With all the noise complaints going to the actual owner renting out the place, they evicted the 2 females, but the boyfriends kept staying. Owner allegedly tried to evict the 2 boyfriends who didn't pay rent, but police said they wouldn't do anything unless the situation escalates. \n\nOne night, we heard gunshots. Police received several calls about gunshots from that unit and they finally broke down the door and arrested the 2 boyfriends. These guys were indeed illegally armed for god knows why and shooting at god knows what. Absolute nightmare.",

If the attacker is not deterred by its presence and comes after you, one moment of hesitation means he is going to take it from you and use it against you. Also, if you aren\u2019t proficient in its use, every shot which doesn\u2019t hit your intended target is a potential death of an innocent bystander. \n\nTLDR: if you get a gun for protection, take a class and train regularly.

                                  "text": "Yes. I had a roommate who used to steal stuff and do heroin, sometimes they get really dopey and sleepy right after taking a dose, but they get strung out and can get aggressive when they start to panic about withdrawal. I\u2019m not sure what drugs the Fire Starter was on\u2026 possibly trying to freebase crack or something, but I\u2019d guess he was on hard drugs. For his sake, hopefully not, but he is definitely a danger to himself and others around him either way.\n\nWhen it comes to being a superintendent/maintenance worker, you see the best and worst of humanity. Also, it does make sense that someone might be aggressive if their space was suddenly intruded on \u2013 people like to imagine a rental space is theirs, but management of the building owners (including maintenance staff) are fully empowered to protect their property and enter apartments to do their job\u2026 it\u2019s a clause specifically made for a situation like this. If you read a rental agreement, they specify something to that effect. Also, it\u2019s not too hard to guess that someone completely unresponsive to answering the door might be unconscious, or even if they are conscious they might attack an \u201cintruder.\u201d\n\nYour light probing had good questions! Unfortunately, this is probably one of those examples of someone living a life as low as they can go. The young neighbor needs help and isn\u2019t going to be able to function in society without intervention and help, but in all likelihood they will actively resist/fight against help and there\u2019s only so much that rehab can do.\n\nI called the police on my roommate (we were renting the second floor of a house) and they caught him with them over $3000 of stolen/credit card fraud goods in a car he had \u201cborrowed\u201d from some friends, which is a felony and lead to him being in jail for the rest of my time in college. These friends were trying to help him, but they didn\u2019t know he was involved in illegal activities, and they realized afterwards that they could have been charged with aiding and abetting, losing any chance of regaining custody of their child. The owner of the house lived on the first floor, and he didn\u2019t realize until after that the once-okay roommate had somehow opened a credit card in the landlord\u2019s name. Not only did I protect these ancillary people and myself, but I honestly think I would not have been able to keep the roommate clean and sober or give him some counseling like he could get in jail and in parole.\n\nI had another friend who very sadly fell into relapse, he pushed me away, a year later his girlfriend died in his arms, and a year later he died too. This friend\u2026 I tried to help him at his gf\u2019s funeral, but his arm stunk of rotting flesh, and his mind was addled and he took advantage of me, putting me in harms way several times (unsafe place to sleep, drug dealer bodyguard, people that brought guns to the funeral because they were blaming eachother), and I had to separate myself from him after the funeral (he lived 5 states away from me). Just in case you\u2019ve (hopefully) never seen anyone on opiates, the heroin doses made my friend get really sleepy and dopey, $40 lasted him like 10 minutes, and absolutely wrecked his ability to cope with his emotions despite his thought that they would help him to numb the pain; while the roommate managed to hide his drug useage, both these guys got rail thin and irrational over time.\n\nIt\u2019s a very ugly, lonely, dangerous lifestyle, and I think the best thing I can do in memory of these two people is to use their stories as warning signs to help people understand why it\u2019s not worth messing with drugs.",

Its a very specific niche of crazy that you can actually pinpoint oddly well. For example, methheads tend to avoid and respond poorly to police involvement, whereas coke users typically have a fixation on getting the cops involved. Very strange to me. MH also tear things apart, hoard like a motherfucker, steal from their own children (thanks daddy-o) and are overall twitchy, tweaky and scatterbrained. It isn't as amusing when you're forced to deal with their antics everyday as opposed to bite size glimpses lol.\n\nHeroine however (thanks daddy-o and a couple other family members) act more like this guy. They party on and on, get super loaded and crash for over half a day or more at a time, regardless of surroundings. Then when they wake up, they're disoriented, jonesing, and freak tf out with a hair trigger. ETA: So I agree, I think Fire Starter was on H, not ice. Also, from my perspective, most users on ice don't drink a lot since it's a waste of money and doesn't affect them the way alcohol normally would. Too many uppers, the alcohol won't do much.",

I yell at him, he runs, but I get a good description this time, and call the cops again, describing him and what he was wearing, and mentioning what my superintendent said. So they go to his unit, he answered the door wearing exactly what I said, and they arrest him and charge him with \"prowling,\" which is like trespassing but a bit more serious because it takes into account that you're doing it at night.\n\nThe police put a restraining order on him and he had to move out, never saw him again.",

Fact is, I want protection, but I have no desire to kill anyone. Ever. I\u2019m just not that kind of person. Most robbers just want \u201cstuff\u201d and my stuff isn\u2019t worth a life. It can all be replaced. I\u2019m really after protecting my family and I think this is the best way that suits who I am. Do you really want to kill someone? It\u2019s a hard burden to bear. \n\nIn the end I just want them to go away and know the house is protected. I guarantee you a pepperball to the face or chest will ruin their day, maybe year. If they flash a gun, shoot them 5 times and the \u201cnon-lethal\u201d may be a misnomer. It\u2019s all about using the appropriate force.\n\nI don\u2019t want a gun gun in my house, and I know how to use them, I was in the military 12 years, but accidents happen. And again, I don\u2019t want to accidentally kill some 12 year old talked into breaking into my house. The key is deterrent and scare away. I\u2019m pretty happy with my non-lethal gun and glad I haven\u2019t neede to use it.  I\u2019ve practiced with it and the slap it makes sounds pretty painful. It\u2019s on par if not stronger than a paint ball gun, and I still remember that sting.",

It keeps you at a certain level for *ages* but the downside is you are ruined the next day and still half f'd up. Sheeeit. Day after the day after you can still feel off.

If memory serves, when the couple divorced she was granted a restraining order and he was ordered to surrender 40+ guns, and she even had a list and their locations. The police got all except 1, which he kept in his truck. The police stated that they had no right to forcibly remove it if he didn\u2019t want to surrender it. He refused to, and later used that very gun to shoot this woman. \n\nDomestic dispute is the number one indicator of firearm violence. You would think we would wise up to this at some point and take action to prevent the most predictably violent people from having guns.\n\nEdit: if the guy is still on parole or probation for the conviction, call his P/P officer. THOSE cops are the ones who get off on sending people back to lockup, and they have the authority to enter their home without calling a judge for a warrant.",

She filed for a modification of her protection order, and as soon as he was served he went to the courthouse and filed a retaliatory protection order, that's when the death threats came.

I hate the concept.\n\nHowever sitting down with people I've asked favors for, and helped out (where I can, because you know how clever some engineers are), or provided leadership feedback that's highly positive- having a sitdown with them is awesome.\n\nBecause they're massively underpaid (in my world) for the skills they have.\n\n  \nI remember walking into the model shop and asking to have a 'filter holder' made because I needed to have a large diameter filter held in front of a laser. I had a rough idea how to do it, and I asked if I could just borrow some tools to make it.\n\nThose guys and gals bent over backwards and got me a master machinist who made it on a CNC box, by hand, while I was sitting there pressing my back into a concrete column suffering from a kidney stone. Did it with no plans. I had to ask a few times as I didn't understand how /why he was centering things, or making certain fly cuts- but I watched this 15 word description turn into a product that got me a delivered set of images in a day.\n\nThat example drove hundreds of thousands of dollars in business... and probably cost about 75$ in 'machinist' time... and maybe cost me 15$ in pizza of good will and name recognition.\n\nUnfortunately, and to this day I regret it, the main contact and man I knew there ended up dying of cancer. He kept it quiet so no one knew. He had a private funeral. I regret to this day not telling him, when he knew it was terminal, how much I was grateful to him for all the knowledge he gave me in the years we worked together... and that I wish even now I could provide that knowledge to his children and grandkids so they knew how special he was.",

(Start at tenants.org or a rental housing association in your area). My concern is that you are looking at moving out as YOU breaking the lease. That is not accurate. You are moving out due to fear for your safety, because of a threat from another tenant. That other tenant, who should have been warned, held in violation of his lease, and evicted long ago. The MM clearly has experience with this tenant and I would bet other tenants also have complained to him and/or the landlord. Allowing the problem tenant to continue his tenancy violated the landlord\u2019s responsibility to uphold the Warrant of Habitability. And if that didn\u2019t do it, we now have conditions so dangerous for you that you feel you must leave. Again, that is not you breaking the lease. It is your landlord failing to act to preserve safe and reasonable living conditions that had caused this. Rules vary by location, but you should at least get out of the remainder of your lease without penalty and 100% of your security deposit. The landlord may owe you additional rent rebated depending on the rules where you live, how long ago this happened, if you repeatedly complained about this tenant, etc.\n\nGo forth and talk to a lawyer!",

So conversations you're in, or places you go, basically it's like an extension of your memory. You can't hang up a camera/microphone and then leave. You also can't just record everything and store it forever \"just because\", but e.g. dashcams with save buttons are fine.\n\nYou also can't just go around sharing them with others or post them online, because then you get privacy issues. But recording for personal issue and submitting it as evidence is perfectly fine (like a witness statement, but as a recording).",

From my understanding the victim had ratted his dealer out previously and he went to jail for a few months, upon release he made an \"example out of him\" in the parking lot broad daylight. Cops frequently patrolled the area, police arrived on the scene almost instantly but too late ofc.\n\nIt was a traumatic event, but my brain was numb at that point and didnt really process it for a while.\n\nThe real trauma for me was the suicide event, a lady with 2 kids drove past me while i was out on the golf cart, told me the bathroom sink in her unit was clogged.\nLow priority task so i didnt go there until about an hour later when I'd finished pickin up the grounds. No one answered when I knocked so I got a key and went in, found the husband hanging. Notified the PM and police, thankfully they arrived before the wife and kids got back  so I didn't have to personally break the news.\n\nI quit a few days later, couldn't help but wonder if I'd just gone immediately to fix the clog if I would've interrupted him. That kept me up at night for a while",

Let\u2019s take a look at this.\n\n* Hears smoke alarm\n* Smells smoke\n* Not getting a response at the door\n* This is occurring in a building you live in\n\nCall fucking 911. Or whatever your localities emergency number is. You just delayed response by at least several minutes (actually, over 20 from the time you first heard the smoke alarm). This is more than enough for any fire to spread enough to destroy not only their apartment, but yours and everyone else\u2019s. God forbid anyone was sleeping or unable to get out. Not to mention, the police will be there to deal with crazy neighbor with a knife. I get it, this is TIFU. But what you did was not logical in the least.",

The girl inherited a nice place from her grandma and trashed it in under a year. At first I tried to ignore their shit because I didn't want anyone to retaliate when I was sleeping or wasn't home. Eventually I started calling 911 when the music got loud or I could hear them fighting. The police just knocked and told them to keep it quiet. But eventually they saw drugs from the doorway and went in. She went to jail for 6 months. Every so often someone would crash there for a few months. Eventually the cops would respond to a call, and it would be empty again. It was vacant for almost two years, but the day I was moving out the owner was back. Fucking meth in small town America.",

Door is cool to touch, but I know its airlocked, I dunno what was with the Police/Firebrigade but they weren't willing to make entry, so I got a hold of our out of hours locksmith, and had him come over, I did an external survey at this point and can see the fire is in the kitchen, we get the door over and I go in, all the doors are open so the place is filled with smoke, I know the layout though, head into the kitchen, and its a stove fire, luckily the way the apartments are designed the cooker is offset from the cabinets and tiled around, so its just the cooker thats on fire, I hit the power switch and throw the fire blanket over it. crack the window, and go looking for the dumbass. Enter the living room, nothing but smoke, find him in the bedroom on the bed fully clothed face down, try to wake him, no dice, pick him up and take him out of the apartment. I go back in crack some windows, and make sure the fire is out. Well...... about 40 mins later the guys GF turns up, they have a huge argument, and he is like 'Where the fuck were you?!?' and she is like 'Fucking General_Jeevicus in the office' at which point, I was just like, you know what, fuck this shit :) :)",

You have to suffer sharing a wall with that donkey show,  and they're already a nightmare whilst living \"naturally\" so imagine what it will look like when he ratchets things up a few more notches to get back at the son of a bitch who dared darken his rented peephole. I've been told \"i know where you live, bitch!\" Too many times. But they usually do mean it and will come back to fuck with you and force you to either participate or act. So act before you get sucked into participating. They'll push you, lie and manipulate, do anything to get you to engage. Good luck.",

While working a summer job I had night shift so one warm afternoon sitting on my back balcony I watched a young fellow sneak into a neighbors backyard.Then the girl who lived there passes out a luggage bag and crawls out the window. As they head back the way he came a police car shows up and they are both detained. About half hour later this guy appears on her balcony and yells at me he and his friends are going to get me.\n\nI was immediately concerned that my wife was going to be home alone that night so decided to go and see him. Went around the corner and there he is just leaving the house. So I tell him I did not call the police and I never left the balcony but if he wanted we could settle it right now. Well, he huffs and puffs while his girlfriend yells that they don't want trouble but I still want to hear him. Before he says anything the same cops who stopped and picked them up, show up and ask what happened.I tell them about his threat and my fear for my wife. They put him in the car and when they let him out they told me they had his info and my wife just had to call the station if anything happened they would pick him up, nothing happened ,ever.\n\nTurned out they were trying to elope and got caught by one of the nosy neighbors.\n\nGood luck as people in this century are very different from the last century.",

You prove that there are still good people in this world. \n\nAs far as the eviction...he most likely will be evicted, or should be. I can't see anyone evicting you for saving someone's life. But worst of all, how dare he threaten you and go after MM with a freaking knife. Sounds to me like too many drugs are in this young person's life. They sound like a danger to themselves and the rest of the neighbors. \n\nYour landlord should be giving you a damn award not an eviction. Had the fire actually still benn actively burning, that whole apartment building would have been up in flames in minutes. Countless lives and unimaginable property damage would have been done. Thank God it didn't get out of hand, but no thanks to Fire Starter. In case no one has told you: Thank you!!! Thank you for paying attention, for caring about others, putting others needs in front of your own comfort and safety, and for being the kind of person this world needs more of.
