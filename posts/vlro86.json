It's like they're beating their chest to show everybody not to mess with them. As soon as someone starts giving any back they get upset and run to management.\n\nIn the meantime the normal women that I work with are nothing special. They do their job just like me.  There's a couple of women that I love working with and they hate these idiots.",

You want to be a strong woman? you have to fight, fight like a girl, don't take anything from anyone, only listen to yourself. Feminine energy, and its power, has been completely rejected. Thats why its so difficult to find the forgiving, soft, receptive feminine energy in the us. my gender has banned it and deemed it weak. I'm determined to show this world how strong this receptive, gentle feminine energy is and try to bring this energy back because I think our country really needs it.",

While saying \"strong man\" usually implies that said man is chivalrous, and uses his strength to protect, especially to protect a woman (which in it's turn means just bullying men she dislikes at her demand). Not even the farthest right-winger ever said that a wife beater is a \"strong and independent man\" but you'd easily find feminists defending husband beaters as \"strong and independent women\" (oh you've already seen at least one case). Strength in a woman = hurt men, strength in a man = protect women.",
