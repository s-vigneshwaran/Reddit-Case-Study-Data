Well, love the orange, like the lime. \n\nSo, she passes on the orange starburst to me. She passes the orange and green skittles to me. She passes the orange and green gummy bears to me. This has been happening for 13 years. \n\nWhat she doesn\u2019t know is that the green Haribo gummy bears are actually strawberry. \n\nShortly after we married, for one reason or another, I looked at the back of the Haribo gummy bears package and discovered this. \n\nSo I haven\u2019t said anything for 13 years. Every time we get gummy bears, she gives me the orange and green (strawberry). I\u2019ve never said a word. I\u2019ve enjoyed eating my little lies. \n\nUntil last night\u2026\n\nWe had some gummy bears and she opened them and she started to hand me the orange and green ones. But after a few minutes, I saw her looking at the back of the bag. Then I saw her eyes get REAL BIG. \n\nShe turned to me and asked if I\u2019ve known that the green bears were strawberry. She always thought they were lime. \n\nI was honest and nodded my head yes. The look of betrayal was unreal\u2026. She asked how long I\u2019ve known, and I was honest. I told her as long as we\u2019ve been married. \n\nShe quit giving me the gummy bears she didn\u2019t like. She was even eating the orange ones out of spite. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get any more gummy bear discards after this. Time to buy my own.\n\nEdit: \n\nWe don\u2019t eat these every day. A few times a year at most.\n\nI don\u2019t just get the \u201crejects.\u201d It\u2019s a shared bag. Whenever she grabs a few, she would pick out the orange and green and hand to me. Just like I would give the pineapple to her (bleh). \n\n\nTL;DR I never corrected my wife by telling her she gave me strawberry gummy bears. She thought they were lime. Now she knows and is spite eating my favorites.",

I was finally like, \"look I fucking hate pork chops, I know you like them, but I just can't do it anymore. Just let me make something else instead of pork chops.\" The entire time she thought they were my favorites and she was neutral to them. I have no idea where she had gotten this idea, I haven't eaten pork chops since I was liek 10 years old outside of those fucking meals. Over the years since we've run into about 3-4 other things she just decided I loved when I am either neutral or hated them lol. We've been together 15 years almost and I'm her only long term relationship lol SO I don't think she's confusing me with someone else.",

However, that study really doesn't have any evidence that diet soda *causes* diabetes. \n\nFrom the study:\n\n> In the current study, dietary patterns of diet beverage consumers and nonconsumers were different in several respects (i.e., regular diet beverage consumers ate more whole grains, fruit, low-fat dairy products, desserts, and coffee but less high-fat dairy products, processed meat, refined grains, and sugar-sweetened soda). These differences are consistent with dietary patterns that have been independently associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes (1).",

Just when you think she can\u2019t stand the suspense for another minute, present her with a pack of Skittles and tell her the green ones are actually green apple. \n\nThen report back to us and let us know how it went.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m reading now they switched back to lime. \n\nSo here\u2019s what you gotta do. Find a pack that still has green apple, do whatever it takes to get your hands on one, no matter the cost. Follow through with plan A (see above). Then you burn her twice because the next time she buys herself some Skittles she\u2019ll eat the lime ones thinking they\u2019re green apple and be thoroughly disgusted.",

When you add green apple, skittles just end up tasting like green apple because it overpowers all the other flavors. You'd likely be happy with a bag full of green apple skittles and nothing else, but that's not the way skittles are supposed to work. Liking green apple has nothing to do with it, it just doesn't work in skittles.",

Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the \u201closer,\u201d and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3\u00d75 card reading, \u201cPlease use this M&M for breeding purposes.\u201d This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this \u201cgrant money.\u201d I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament.

He encouraged me to go back to college (I did), tried to help me study (I went into  geology; his degrees are English and Literature.

We recently bought a second home (I\u2019m still in shock that we could buy a second home!) Now we\u2019re having it renovated. I retire in six and a half months with a sweet pension and full social security. My life could hardly be better. Well maybe if we won the lottery, but really we both are super happy together.",

Whenever we'd be stopped at a red light, I'd keep an eye over at the other light that was perpendicular to mine at the intersection. Without making it obvious, I would watch out the corner of my eye and wait for the other light to go from yellow to red, then after a second or two, I'd snap my fingers and my light would pretty much instantly turn green (obviously, since the lights are on timers). This legitimately dumbfounded and mystified my GF. She was always amazed and somehow didn't realize the secret to my traffic light clairvoyancy. Finally, after two years of dating and countless rides in my car, I guess I wasn't being slick enough and she noticed I glanced at the other light at an intersection we were stopped at and she shouted \"OH MY GOD, WAIT, ARE YOU JUST LOOKING FOR WHEN THE OTHER LIGHT TURNS RED AND THEN SNAPPING YOUR FINGERS?!?!?\" \n\nThe cat was out of the bag and she refused to talk to me for the rest of the ride and part of dinner, hahah.",

He remarked that he wished he could have some of his grandmother's chocolate cake. So naturally I said, \"I have the recipe, I can make it for you.\" The look of utter betrayal on his face was astounding. He *could not* believe that in seven years of marriage I never once made it, or even let him know I had the recipe. My response was, you never asked. He was wounded a second time, right to the heart. \n\nThat was a decade ago and I haven't lived it down yet.",

It was incredible the lengths that I went to to find new ones, translate them into english, I tried everything.\n\nFinally, I asked Mom for her pancake recipe. She laughed, and told me you just add water to bisquick. I told her it wasn't funny, I was really struggling, and I needed to know. She sat me down, and very clearly explained she's never made anything from scratch in her life. When he wants something like Mom made, I need to find a box and add water to it.",

What are the odds that some random recipe from a different country is going to be what he likes?\n\nThere's nothing wrong with Bisquick and in fact most cake shops start with premade cake mix because it's impossible to replicate that food science in a kitchen.\n\nThough if you are really just adding water to Bisquick you are fucking it up. They made the formula to require other ingredients because housewives felt like they weren't really cooking if they just added water (same reason cake mix needs an egg) -- the easiest pancake mix is Krusteaz which is really just add water. Plus the name can be pronounced as \"Krusty Ass\" which is another plus.",

Well, love the orange, like the lime. \n\nSo, she passes on the orange starburst to me. She passes the orange and green skittles to me. She passes the orange and green gummy bears to me. This has been happening for 13 years. \n\nWhat she doesn\u2019t know is that the green Haribo gummy bears are actually strawberry. \n\nShortly after we married, for one reason or another, I looked at the back of the Haribo gummy bears package and discovered this. \n\nSo I haven\u2019t said anything for 13 years. Every time we get gummy bears, she gives me the orange and green (strawberry). I\u2019ve never said a word. I\u2019ve enjoyed eating my little lies. \n\nUntil last night\u2026\n\nWe had some gummy bears and she opened them and she started to hand me the orange and green ones. But after a few minutes, I saw her looking at the back of the bag. Then I saw her eyes get REAL BIG. \n\nShe turned to me and asked if I\u2019ve known that the green bears were strawberry. She always thought they were lime. \n\nI was honest and nodded my head yes. The look of betrayal was unreal\u2026. She asked how long I\u2019ve known, and I was honest. I told her as long as we\u2019ve been married. \n\nShe quit giving me the gummy bears she didn\u2019t like. She was even eating the orange ones out of spite. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get any more gummy bear discards after this. Time to buy my own.\n\nTL;DR I never corrected my wife by telling her she gave me strawberry gummy bears. She thought they were lime. Now she knows and is spite eating my favorites.",

I always liked the blue and teal colored cups, and my husband always liked the green and orange cups (yes we are toddlers who drink from plastic cups). Well, from the start, I would always grab the green and orange cups because I thought my husband liked the blue and teal ones as much as I did. Well, he kept grabbing the ones I liked because he thought the same. So we were both saving each other from our hated colors while punishing each other at the same time. YEARS (like literally 10-11 years) we did this to give up our favorite colors so the other could have them. One day, I grabbed my favorite teal cup and husband said, \u201cBut there are green and orange ones left!\u201d I told him I know but I really like this cup and just wanted it tonight. Told him I\u2019m sorry to inconvenience him, but please just for tonight. He looked at me funny and said \u201cI thought you hated those cups?! I was like I love those cups? What do you like?

She started to question every little thing, such as the way you like your pancakes, to which shoe you put on in the morning first left or right. It then started her questioning bigger things, like why you were 5 minutes late coming home from work, or who that \"caller unknown\" phone call on your call is. She questions your reason for not taking that great job in Los Angeles that you were offered, even though you would have had to move from your current mid-western home. Eventually it leads to a brutal and long argument one day when you two are much older, where she calls you out on every lie she perceived you committed, even though you did not, and she just cannot bring herself to believe a word you say. She doesn't even think you are who you say you are, she doesn't even know your name anymore. This, ultimately is what led to your divorce in the year 2042. Which, after 6 months of wallowing in depression and self-reflection, wandering the streets until you get a news bulletin on your AR-Contact Lenses about a sudden earthquake on the western coast of California that was so massive, everything west of the San Andreas Fault breaks apart and much of it falls into the sea. \n\nYour little lie about the green Strawberry Gummi Bears inadvertently saved your life.",

He goes and buys two pineapple muffins and his coworkers just look at him strangely while I happily devour both. He looks them dead in the face and says \"I fucking hate pineapple, these are for always for her.\" I just nodded and then everyone busted out laughing. The cafeteria dude just looked like he died inside. Dad apologized and still always bought me muffins until I left for college. Then one month in I get a box with the return address from my dad's work. I opened it. Full of pineapple muffins. I laughed so hard and told dad. Every month I got a box of pineapple muffins until I dropped out. When my dad passed away in February, his work left pineapple muffins for me and mom at the church. I cried so hard.",

I must now ctrl alt delete my brain which due to this story causing several faults and short circuits to my brain.  \n\nI certainly wish I was on the toilet when read this.  After doing so I could end reading this placing myself in a comfortable relaxed position, then blanketing the now released bears swimming in my American Standard.  That would have been a nicer outcome to counteract a story design to steel ones life force. \n\nWhen I read this all I could hear, over and over, consecutively for several minutes even beyond reading this was the power down sound made by Obi-Wan Kenobi on the first Death Star.  If only I had the same fictional luck of facing my black robed, part mechanical, former Padawan, turned Sith, so I could escape such force stealing traps and finally escape to the Living force where I have a chance to place light years of distance from the source and even some of the beyond stupid responses.  \n\nSince reading this I have had a sudden cringe in my stomach which may lead to hopefully a giant power duke that probably will cause an hour or so of pain followed by a virtual, unreal, concrete fist that will punch me in the balls endlessly, if read this again.  Either it is the fact a married, adult is writing about candy preferences, or that he was afraid that he was lying to his wife about candy, or his iterative statement that they don't eat candy all the time which demonstrated that the story was interesting & it makes him a literary genius.  So much of this matters, it's life or death here\" his wife may kill him he says!\n\nNice story, bro!  Tell it again!\n\n\n- I just vomited again for the 5th time since writing this response.

On a dresser or table or whatever. Well after she passed, months later, I was at my partner\u2019s house and I had to reach under sofa for fallen item. Out came a blue M and M. Felt like a sign lol. So now it sits in a bowl of decorative rocks because those things are like Twinkies and will never die. \n\nAnyway point is one day you will randomly encounter a green strawberry bear and know it was a sign. :)",

I saw opportunity and slipped in \"yea I read that the cherry additive in drinks like cherry coke are super harmful\". She 100% bit onto this \"fact\" so much so if I got a soda when we were out she would ask if it's cherry then leave it alone. This lasted all her pregnancy and she still believed it till she told a newly pregnant friend months later. That friend said that \"fact\" sounded weird and they actually tried to look it up. Trust may have been broken but I had 9 months of my own drinks and it was glorious.",

Well, love the orange, like the lime. \n\nSo, she passes on the orange starburst to me. She passes the orange and green skittles to me. She passes the orange and green gummy bears to me. This has been happening for 13 years. \n\nWhat she doesn\u2019t know is that the green Haribo gummy bears are actually strawberry. \n\nShortly after we married, for one reason or another, I looked at the back of the Haribo gummy bears package and discovered this. \n\nSo I haven\u2019t said anything for 13 years. Every time we get gummy bears, she gives me the orange and green (strawberry). I\u2019ve never said a word. I\u2019ve enjoyed eating my little lies. \n\nUntil last night\u2026\n\nWe had some gummy bears and she opened them and she started to hand me the orange and green ones. But after a few minutes, I saw her looking at the back of the bag. Then I saw her eyes get REAL BIG. \n\nShe turned to me and asked if I\u2019ve known that the green bears were strawberry. She always thought they were lime. \n\nI was honest and nodded my head yes. The look of betrayal was unreal\u2026. She asked how long I\u2019ve known, and I was honest. I told her as long as we\u2019ve been married. \n\nShe quit giving me the gummy bears she didn\u2019t like. She was even eating the orange ones out of spite. \n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get any more gummy bear discards after this. Time to buy my own.\n\nTL;DR I never corrected my wife by telling her she gave me strawberry gummy bears. She thought they were lime. Now she knows and is spite eating my favorites.",

She only gave you those candies because they were worthless to her, and once she found out that they might benefit her, she was angry that she let you have them. \n\nThis is a small example, but if you look at your relationship from a wider perspective, do you still see this pattern in other areas? If so? Run the hell away. get the hell out and get as far away as possible.",

I don\u2019t care if her partner didn\u2019t tell her that what she assumed was like and therefore actually worth sharing with her partner (but only because she didn\u2019t like those ones). \n\nI had an ex like that. She had certain candies which she didn\u2019t like the color/flavor of, and therefore gave all of those ones to me. Which ones I liked or wanted never came up, just these are ones she doesn\u2019t want so they\u2019re the ones she gave to me. She had borderline personality disorder, and that was an abusive relationship. i\u2019m not saying that \u201cyou get these colors\u201d is 100% telling of an abusive relationship, but it still comes down to \u201ci get my needs first, and you get the leftovers\u201d is very common in abusive relationships. \n\nbut abusive or not, it\u2019s certainly not a sign of an equal partnership. candy doesn\u2019t seem consequential, but if this is part of a pattern of selfishness then it\u2019s completely not a sign of an equal partnership.",

This post describes a situation where one partner is given two colors of candy (and, as far as we can tell, two colors ONLY), specifically because the other partner did not like those \u201ccolors\u201d of candy, and then when that partner found out that the color didn\u2019t actually align with what they thought it was, got bitter at the first partner for eating them, when she might have actually enjoyed them. \n\nThat\u2019s not compromise, that\u2019s domination. If that\u2019s the only part of this relationship that has that dynamic (or if both partners are actually seeking that dynamic), that\u2019s totally okay. \n\nBut if you\u2019re seeking an equal partnership, then let your partner have a color/flavor you might like yourself, or ask them which they like. Saying \u201ci don\u2019t like orange/green so these are all for you\u201d without actually tasting orange/green yourself to see if you like them, and then getting mad when green isn\u2019t the flavor you assumed it was when you said \u201cyou can have all the greens?\u201d. That\u2019s your fucking fault, not your partner\u2019s. \n\nAnd the fact that OP mentioned that she, after the revelation that greens weren\u2019t the flavor she thought, started eating the orange ones just to spite him? That means the whole orange/green thing was never important to her flavor-wise. These are the candies she gave him, as a method of control. It never had anything to do with the fact that she didn\u2019t \u201clike\u201d those flavors. They\u2019re just the flavors that she felt he was worthy of, or, at least, the flavors (sorry, this should really say colors, because flavor doesn\u2019t matter. color does. otherwise she might have tried one of the green ones in 13 years) that weren\u2019t worthy of her. \n\nShe didn\u2019t like the orange ones either, until she got the tasty fucking flavor of \u201ci\u2019m eating these just out of spite, and that spite tastes delicious even though i wouldn\u2019t eat orange candies otherwise\u201d.

OP\u2019s partner later did the same thing, and then got angry. I can understand this, most candy versions of flavors just taste like sugar to me. I can\u2019t tell. Give me the real fruit or the real juice and i can tell you right away what\u2019s in it. But candies just taste like sugar to me, and not like the fruits they are supposed to represent. \n\nAny asshole knows that green, in candy form, can be a whole host of flavors. watermelon, apple, lime, mint, pear, kiwi, probably a few more i\u2019m not thinking of, can all be found in greenish hues. OP\u2019s partner assumed green meant one flavor, and handed those off for 13 years. At any fucking point, OP\u2019s partner could have tasted a green one and thought \u201coh, i actually like this flavor\u201d.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve heard nothing from OP about which flavors they actually like, just that they get the colors their partner won\u2019t eat.

Most of those stats are based on domestic violence, because physical abuse leaves scars and is the most obvious. What\u2019s more terrifying is a partner that knows they can control you without laying a finger on you and leaving physical evidence, and that most people will dismiss your abuse because domestic violence is the only type of abuse that is given attention publicly, and almost always only when it\u2019s a man beating a woman. \n\nThere\u2019s a difference between a relationship where \u201cwe fight a lot\u201d and a both verbally and emotionally abusive relationship, where you fight a lot but the point of the fights are to belittle you and break you down to the point that you\u2019re just staying in the relationship for pathological reasons. You start believing all the awful things they say about you, and see yourself as completely worthless and you hit a point where the only thing that matters is their approval because they\u2019ve cut you off from all your old friends and hobbies, so that their approval of you is the only thing that matters to you. It\u2019s a relationship through hostage taking. There were even a few times where she actually pushed things to a physical point. Ive been shoved and pushed and slapped and had things thrown across the room at me, and even once she punched me in the chest with a closed fist, which hurt for 3 weeks because even breathing hurt because that\u2019s what happens when your muscles around your ribcage get bruised. \n\nTherapists often refuse to work with BPD people, because the mind games and mental gymnastics can have an effect on you where don\u2019t even recognize yourself anymore, after just a few hour-long sessions. I have a sister in law who is a crisis counselor and works with people with BPD and she admitted to me that she even told her husband/my brother after a few sessions that she didn\u2019t recognize herself any more after a few sessions.\n\nAnd nope, I\u2019m 42 and ive been through getting out of a low-level bad/toxic relationship multiple times before this. Being with someone who has both Borderline and Narcissistic personality disorders is a whole different enchilada, and most people have not been in a relationship like that, and most that do don\u2019t stay in them for 6 years. Don\u2019t belittle my experiences.",
