When I started to argue back, he's like well at least gas prices will go down. When I'm like ay dude that whole team of people want people like me dead (trans), he shrugged it off as 'well you don't even live there, why do you care?'. Because of dipshits like you, is why...\n\nDid I mention we live in Canada!? This was a Canada day argument! Can't we just argue about Trudeau like normal people!? Honestly the friendship was waning anyway but after that I don't think I can continue. Just gonna have to suck it up and buy my own grill lol",

While progressives have fought in vain to shift the public view toward systemic violence, conservatives identify individuals (or individual cases) whose actions represent the biases they're looking to confirm. So, every time an injustice occurs that refutes that worldview, they simply find an example that ostensibly supports it.\n\nI just argued yesterday with a white dude who claimed that feminism is full of \"radicals\" (undefined term) who hate men, all while arguing traditional masculinity is under attack (again, \"traditional\" was left undefined). When I pointed out that feminism is a complicated academic discipline with internal disagreements of its own, and that lesbian and trans women of color especially have historically advocated for themselves at great personal risk, he rejected me out of hand as a virtue signaling racists for... uhh... mentioning race at all. It's fruitless and exhausting arguing with these people.",

Dunno if there's actual hate in his heart, but he's the definition of useful idiot.\n\nTrades can be great career move, but unfortunately the environment can absolutely have that effect if you're not mindful. There was a welding instructor at my school who had a Trump sticker on his hood. In Canada. Vancouver, BC. Who actually took time from our day once to yell about tReAsOn Of ThE hIgHeSt OrDeR because of something he read on Rebel Media. My buddy who actually became a welder and didn't flunk out like I did is the only person in his shop who jumped at the chance for a day off with pay to hit up a vaccine pop-up down the street. It takes a certain level of self awareness to be around that stuff for 40+ hours a week and not get sucked in. Also compounded by the fact none of us live down there, it's just a fucked up spectator sport to them. I at least have the excuse of having grown up in Georgia, I'm somewhat emotionally invested in what happens to my loved ones. \n\nStill, fuck him and his grill lol dipshit doesn't even know how to light charcoal right!",

Peaceful protests in Portland are a part of life there. The BLM protests were 100% peaceful just as any other, and the local Oregonian government was doing a fine job handling it the way they should, by holding talks with the organizers and only policing fringe cases of civic distruption. Portland protesters have always done well to keep their own in line. \n\nTrump decided he wanted to make an example out of Portland so he sent in government agents who don't know/care about Oregonian political intricacies, and of course his personal Proud Boys gestapo followed suit causing a ruckus. Then there was Trump\u2019s propaganda arm ready to turn any case of instigated violence into a one-sided story about \u201cantifa terrorism\u201d - By the way, if fascist forces invaded your homeland and you are inclined to oppose that, that would make you anti-fascist.  (Note that antifa protestors did not appear until after Trump sent in his forces)\n\nThe most depressing thing is that the protests had actually been winding down before Trump got involved and turned it into a national political fiasco.",

Right now I believe that God is intrinsically and most closely tied to the subjective experience of our human based search for meaning. It's not something that you can really argue whether it exists or not, it isn't anywhere in the realm of objective objects. It's more like an idea or a subjective experience, so it really doesnt make sense to talk about whether they exist or not but only what ones experience of it is like.",

But in the same breath he says the can do what they want but they have also gone to far and how maybe conservatives are right in their response.\nHe seems to have a conservative view when it comes to gender he wont admit it fully but its clear he views women as lesser. Again he wont admit that its because of sexism he just thinks its the natural order.\nHe wont admit he is anti choice but he has been saying odd things since roe got overturned that makes me think he is a conservative on the issue and agrees with it.\nHe is clearly homophobic but like most things he is in denial about it.\n\nHe is just one example in my family my dad is unapologetic in a lot of his views but he is a agnostic and it extents to the rest of the black community which is very conservative. The only reason why black people do not blindly vote for conservatives because there is enough common since to see the anti black narratives they push.\n\n\nThis is also the case with other groups like Hispanics who are a big voting block for republicans and growing most dont want to say this but they are kind of the reason why we will be a theocracy in the decades to come.\n\nThere are other groups as well so you are on point.",

And when Roe was decided, the Baptist Press (the national newswire of the southern baptists) [said:](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/baptist-press-initial-reporting-on-roe-v-wade/)\n\n> *Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.*\n\nThey also said:\n\n>  **Question:** Was this a Warren type or \u201cliberal\u201d Supreme Court that rendered the decision?\n\n> **Answer:** No. This was a \u201cstrict constructionist\u201d court, most of whose members have been appointed by President Nixon. \n\nEven as late as [1978](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/resolution-on-abortion-5/) their official position was that government should keep its nose out of a lady's business, reiterating [their resolution from 1977:](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/resolution-on-abortion-4/)\n\n> we also affirm our conviction about the limited role of government in dealing with matters relating to abortion, and support the right of expectant mothers to the full range of medical services and personal counseling for the preservation of life and health.\n\nPolitical operators essentially flipped the southern baptist movement over night.  But they didn't get any evangelicals on the court, instead they handed it over to people they had loathed for centuries.",

      "text": "I am repeating myself. As an observer from the UK (who, by the way, loves the ideal of the US - so no offence intended), I have been saying again and again, for over five years, that there was something dangerous and insidious brewing in the US (especially since Trump's win). He wasn't really religious at all (of course he wasn't), but he put in place the building-blocks; that was always the deal, and why conservative evangelicals voted for him \\[they didn't like him as a person, but they always had a longer-term plan - and central to that was the 'deal' that he would rig the Supreme Court with 'their' people\\]. \n\nIn the UK, the Supreme Court (12 justices) is appointed by an independent committee (the Prime Minister literally has no say) and it is not a job for life; it is limited to receiving appeals from the high-courts - it has no power to overturn laws introduced by the democratically elected parliament (it just cannot do that). I know things get much more complicated in the US due to the federal and state system. \n\nI am not saying it could not happen in the UK, but it is massively less likely that religious fundamentalists could get a hold on the levers of power, because, ironically, it is a very strong principle here that you just keep religion and politics separate (which I had believed was a central tenet of the US constitution). It just seems astonishing, in a country of over 300 million people, that a 5-4 vote by a collection of politically appointed judges can so fundamentally change your rights.\n\nI am just worried for you guys. It won't stop at Roe v Wade. Once you base a decision on a supposedly religious foundation then, my word, everything is at risk (being gay, being a woman, not attending a prayer service, the scientific process of determining knowledge, the concept of evolution etc). Some of my American friends have repeatedly told me I was being alarmist - it would never happen. But it has, and it is.",

Because using a millennia old work of fan-fiction written decades or centuries after the events that are described in it to try to control what OTHER people do is abhorrent.

Basics like \"Love your neighbour\" and \"Turn the other cheek\" and \" 'Vengeance is mine', sayeth the Lord\". \n\nSome of the messages of Christianity are good - but those aren't the ones that are most often brought up by \"Christians\" today. If more of the faithful actually followed the things that Jesus said and/or did (allegedly) then the US - the WORLD - wouldn't be in it's current state. I don't like people that ignore the parts that they don't like, spew the parts that suit their purposes, and tell other human beings that they don't deserve to live, don't deserve to be free to choose what they do and don't do, and try to force everyone into following their twisted mockery of a \"religion\" - and then punish them for not believing the same as them.\n\nAnd - quite frankly, Aaron Sorkin wrote it much better than I have, so watch this clip on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CPjWd4MUXs",

The problem is that objective scholarship does not back up many of the distinctions Christians like to make.  For example, in Leviticus it is common to claim that some of the laws applied to everyone, and some of them only applied to the Levites.   But there is no support for that distinction in the text.  If there were two types of commands there is no way to distinguish from the text which law is of which type.  Modern Christians \"like\" the prohibition against homosexuality so they say that applies to everyone.  But things like shellfish and tattoos are ruled as levite only because shrip and lobster are yummy.",

He asked people to read a portion of Matthew along with him.  Most people could not find Matthew on their own.\n\nIn another case someone gave out a quiz for people to identify which parts of the nativity story were in Matthew and which were in Luke.  The other options were \"both\" and \"neither.\"   He had \"Little Drummer Boy\" as one of the options.  Most people in the class checked it off as being in the Bible.\n\nIn my experience the lack of Biblical knowledge even extends to a lot of ministers.  Some ministers can recite an impressive list of scriptures that support their denomination's theology.  But they have no idea how the different parts of the Bible fit together.  They are incapable of having a discussion of biblical issues unless they involve their memorized verses.\n\nI think atheists have a lot of advantages over Christians when it comes to reading the Bible.  Christians tend to have models in their heads of the major Bible stories and verses that touch on their theology.  When they read the Bible they tend to fit what they read into their mental models.  Another problem is that Christians tend to harmonize the different parts of the Bible.  They try to twist and distort what the Bible says in order to make it appear consistent.\n\nAs an atheist I enjoy studying the Bible so much more than I did as a Chrstian.  I no longer need apologetics.  I am free to try to understand and appreciate what each author is saying.  I don't have to pretend the Bible is conistent and conforms to my modern theology.",

They treat their neighbours well. They let others worship as they want. They don't stand on streetcorners telling the rest of us that we're going to hell unless we follow their church. \n\nNow, \"Christians\" - those folks are who I am talking about. You know the kind - claim that they know the nature of divinity, judge those that won't follow them, presume power, oppress those that aren't \"with them\". The ones that fire someone for not believing as they do. That use a ritual from their church as an excuse to shame others, or declare that they deserve punishment, or to justify their own abuse of others. Them - I got a problem with. \n\nGo ahead - ask them. They keep quoting Leviticus as justification for taking away rights from LGBTQ+ folks. They keep pointing to the Bible as justification for the repressive and oppressive laws they want to pass. I just hate bullies and liars, that's all. I believe in science. I believe in trying to be better, more understanding of others, and helping those that need it. So, I do my small part to try to discuss, understand, learn from and educate those that I come across, online and in person. I just wish more people did that instead of grabbing for power and using fan-fiction from centuries ago as justification for why the rest of us should let them.\n\nI'd be happy to keep discussing this with you. I would love to know why you are responding the way that you do. Unfortunately, it feels like a very one-sided conversation. This \"one sentence at a time\" thing that you've done is tiresome, and I'm done responding to it tonight.\n\nHave a great day, and good luck.",

I can see our corrupt government being happy at the chaos but the military not so much they will see it as a threat to homeland security and will step in.\n\n China and russia will be happy to know America wont be able to try and pull the moral card when it will have to crackdown on blue and red states.\n\n I can see red states trying to attack blue states when blue states make it clear we dont have to follow their values. And they will only get madder once blue states defend themselves.\n\nRed staters make it clear they want all of America to be just like them they gave the game up and will be enraged that blue states will defy them. I can see blue states ignoring the supreme court at some point especially in regards to Christian rulings and that will certainly trigger the religious states.\n\nWill a outright civil war happen? No. But the US is going to crack down ultra hard on everyone. Best I can say to anyone is to defend yourself if need be like if its clearly some red state nut job. If its the military just back down and do as they say because it will end badly for everyone At least blue state types will most likely listen red staters still think they can repeat 1776 and will find out thats not going to happen in the modern era.",

We can acknowledge religion, but we should focus on helping those who are vulnerable to religious persecution. Read theistic and non-theistic philosophy. Understand their arguments better than they do; and then break those points down in an understanding and empathetic way. We have to be bigger; and we must be stronger. Stronger in mind and in spirit; we are capable of a truer kind of love. The kind of love that loves humanity, for all of its quirks and mistakes. There must be some way that we can show a real alternative to religion that proves to be more effective in uniting and leading people in love and acceptance.",

There was a group of people in RTP who's goal was to push Christianity into every business they were in. Partner #2 went overboard. \n\nEvery time I left town for work, he'd take that as free license to push the Christian thing to all employees. I always had to come back and repair whatever he'd done. This meant prayers in meetings, witnessing to each employee, etc. \n\nI used our third partner, who'd know him for a long time, to try to contain him. Finally, the board fired him along with many other employees. I hated losing the others, but I was glad he was gone. It really freed up my time! :P\n\nHe actually hosted church meetings in our offices! One day I heard some yelling and looked down our long hallway into the conference room to see people writhing on the floor and chanting in words I didn't recognize! Awesome!",

      "text": "About 12-13 years ago, I interviewed for a job that seemed to pay pretty well for west Texas. I get a phone call from the company saying they were interested in me and wanted me to come in for my interview. The interviewer gets to chatting me up wanting to know things I\u2019m into and other stuff and then sets up a time to come in. I get there on the assigned date and he starts the interviewer and taking to tour of the business and where I would be working and so on. I\u2019m there well over an hour and I\u2019m thinking this is great, they are really interested in me. \n\nSo we sit down in this excluded corner for employees and we start chatting about a few things, then he tells me straight up if I had issues working with a family run business and what that could include. Having done so for many years I told him of the reason why I moved to the area. He then asks me if I had an issue if the company\u2019s owners are religious. He then lets the other shoe drop and tells me that he is interviewing me for his job, and the company wanted someone like him (in work skills). He then told me that they open and close every morning meeting with prayer and that you are expected to participate. This was one of the reasons he told me he was leaving. He had been there for two years and just couldn\u2019t stand it any longer. He then concluded the interview with (under his breath) that I should look elsewhere because they would not be friendly to me if they found out I was no longer a Christian. I hung out a few minutes more and we talked music and performing and then we parted ways. He called me a few days later to see if I was interested and told him, no. He then told me that I dodged a bullet and wished me well. \n\nHe called me a few months later to invite me to one of his gigs at a local bar. My wife and I went out to see him and enjoyed his guitar work. Afterward he told me how they acted towards him after his days were up and how they still haven\u2019t found someone and have been asking for him to reconsider. I thanked him again and that\u2019s when he told me he was Wiccan and wanted to make sure his replacement wouldn\u2019t have to put up with it as well.",

One person may not work on Saturday for religious reasons; another person may not work on Saturday for family\r reasons. Under Title VII, a practice is religious if the employee's reason for the practice is religious.\n\n\nread carefully. if you say atheist practices are religious, they are. i mean, you and i know they aren\u2019t, but according to how this was written, it is. our \u201creligion\u201d is non-religion. or you can lie.\n\nthis isn\u2019t up to the supreme court anyway. it\u2019s codified in law.",
