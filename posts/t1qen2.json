He told him, Luke Skywalker, that Darth Vader killed his father.  Darth Vader was a bad guy, so Luke was upset.  Really upset!  Then, Darth Vader tells Luke he's actually his father.  Luke didn't take that very well with the scream and falling down the big... the big shaft.  He talks to Obi-wan later... his ghost.  Wouldn't that be something?  To come back as a ghost?  He asks Obi-wan why he said Luke's father was dead.  He's not!  He's Darth Vader!  Empire Strikes Back, have you seen this movie?  Obi-wan tells Luke how his father became Darth Vader.  See?  He's not the same person anymore.  He's different... a different guy... and Obi-wan says it was true from a certain point of view.  Luke was understandably confused.  A lot of people were, watching that movie.  I wasn't.  I knew what he was saying.  And then... you know... Darth Vader was the bad guy.  People thought he was bad, but he turns out to be good... at the very end there when his mask comes off.  Remember that?  Great scene.  Obi-wan was a good guy and Luke believed him, but it... it wasn't the truth.  Then, Luke believed Vader... the bad guy.  He believed the guy everyone was saying is bad.  People say Putin is bad, but... you know... he tells me he's not interested in Ukraine and I believe him.  My intelligence guys say that's wrong, but I tell ya... I know more than them.  They're always impressed with how much I know.  Obi-wan didn't tell the truth, really.  You know?  So this is like that.  Putin only seems bad and I believe what he says the same way Luke Skywalker believed Darth Vader.\"",

The only reason Trump\u2019s foreign policy wasn\u2019t a complete boon to Russia was because Trump didn\u2019t give a fuck about actually doing the job. He let a bunch of Bush and Reagan era neocons manage his foreign policy. One bright side of letting those devils back into the White House is that they were at least also hawks on Russia.\n\nEven as a Senator, Biden believed in the Untied State\u2019s ability and professed values enough to push the United States to intervene to stop genocide in the Balkans. He cares more about domestic politics, but he is competent enough to handle foreign policy. He is one of the best people we could have hoped for to be in change right now.",

When I informed her that that\u2019s a drop in the bucket, and that it\u2019s not like Biden isn\u2019t trying to pass a massive infrastructure bill along with other plans to help. Then she defaults back to her favorite argument: that one time Biden sent India $2 trillion for gender research. If you\u2019re wondering what that is referring to, it was $25 million sent to Pakistan in 2020 for democratic progress and gender programs. I\u2019ve corrected her a hundred times, but this is still her biggest fucking concern on a geopolitical scale. \n\nWar? Genocide? Doesn\u2019t matter, $2 trillion went to India because of Biden. It was Congress? $25 million is nothing? I\u2019ll conveniently forget that, and bring this talking point back up next time anything political comes up just to throw a wrench in the cogs and make it about my feelings\n\nBecause when I calmly explain things to her, it becomes me calling her stupid. If I don\u2019t allow her to steamroll the conversation, I\u2019m somehow yelling at her (like not even in tone, let alone volume, am I doing anything but calmly having a conversation). Just because she doesn\u2019t know the facts doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not allowed to form an opinion, right? \n\nI\u2019m tired of this, it\u2019s disingenuous and to me, repulsive behavior. I can\u2019t even talk to her about it because she cannot or will not understand that her feelings do not make her informed, and turns me into an asshole who is somehow berating her or something \n\nThe worst part is that we have a pretty good relationship aside from this. She is level-headed and communicates well in pretty much any other area that isn\u2019t her unchallengeable political opinions. I don\u2019t know what to do about this or how to solve this issue and I don\u2019t know if I care to anymore. I\u2019m tired of tolerating ignorant people\u2019s opinions, and if that means I have to be alone then fuck it",

Mention that you're not saying to never bring up politics again, but ask she be more mindful of it in the future and it's not her fault that you get frustrated, that you sometimes just can't help it. \n\nTry to speak with a calm tone throughout. Then you go back to hanging out and continue doing what your were doing. It before. It shouldn't feel super serious\n\n\n*watching TV*\n>\"Hey there's something that I wanted to talk you about.

I just don't want to be upset with you over something you weren't doing on purpose. I hope you understand that the reason I brought this up is because I love you and I care about relationship and want us to be happy. Anyways that's all I wanted to say.\"\n\n*go back to watching TV*",

Stopped letting it make me angry that all these politicians don't fix anything. Both sides are pretty pathetic whether its the politicians themselves or the supporters. My life has greatly enhanced since shutting the politics down. But anyways, we're all ignorant, some of us are just positive about it. Stay positive.",

If you are unaware look up his handling of Afghanistan withdrawal. Ukraine has been invaded under Biden. I\u2019m not sure the same would have been true if democrats like yourself could have picked a stronger nominee. (Plenty of choices tried to be the democrat nominee) Elections have consequences and 80 million people thought Biden was best choice. Don\u2019t do it again, have the nominee between ages of 40 to 60 and have all their mental faculties and I\u2019ll happily vote democrat. (Until then don\u2019t elect Biden or orange man)",

Full disclosure independent voter here. Both Biden & Trump have done unsavory things throughout their lifetimes. You have failed to provide a single example of Biden\u2019s foreign policy that he has done well. That is probably bc there hasn\u2019t been any accomplishments so far. As a result I\u2019ll stand by my statement that Biden\u2019s Foreign Policy has been a disaster. I hope most dem voters are not radicalized and able critically think about stuff for the next election in 3 years (and nominate someone worth voting for)",

Obama slapped heavy-ass sanctions on Russia that deeply affected Putin's circle of oligarchs (thus partly why Trump despises Obama specifically).\n\nTrump brought on Manafort to launder more money for Russia through the NRA / DB and feed the Trump and GOP pocket book after his campaign went belly up. Putin paid Manafort, Putin paid Giuliani's Ukraine trip to get dirt on Bidens. Rudy got the ambassador to Ukraine fired.\n\nTrump was afraid of the Mueller investigation because.. obviously.. so he brought in Barr. Meanwhile he sued up to the SCOTUS to block access to DB records. Barr also protected Rudy.\n\nThat's before we even get into the tie between DB and SCOTUS justice Kennedy, or Trump's push to allow Crimea to be Putin's so he could build his hotel in Yalta, or even Trump's push to weaken sanctions on Russia - that Republicans had to codify in order to prevent.\n\nIf you don't believe at this point that Trump is an asset owned by Russia, you need to re-evaluate all the things you think couldn't be possible.\n\nWho would want Americans to die from a preventable illness? Our enemies.\n\nWho would want Americans to be divided and infighting? Our enemies.\n\nWho would want to destabilize the American government and democracy? Our enemies.\n\nSo ask yourself who is pushing the agendas that deepen these scenarios?\n\nEdit: But you think what you want in Fantasyville. Go jump on r/conservative and sell crazy. They\u2019re buying up all the crazy they can get over there. Trump was Putin's plan A for NATO and Ukraine. What's happening now is a desperate attempt at a poorly planned and poorly executed plan B.\n\nAlso - 8 million votes bitch.",

And I believe you now when you say that you dont hate me, but I also believe that you mocked and insulted me simply because i made a factual Statement about the Video of this Post, without defending or condemning anybody.\n\nAnd you were quick to create a 2-dimensional caricature that represents me, and he happened to be an avid trump supporter and brainwashed idiot, which is why it's been impossible for you and me to have any meaningful conversation so far.\n\nYouve stopped insulting me now, but others keep doing it right now. You said that the left doesnt need to do anything and that trump will polarize people on his own. Nah mate, that's your leftist propaganda doing the polarizing, because even though we hardly disagree on anything from the start, I still had to be your enemy, and it's not because trump said so.",

Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think there may be some other explanation.

The US spent a generation trying to help Afghanistan be a stable country and in the end the Afghan people failed to stand up for themselves and let the Taliban take back over. It was absolutely the right thing to do and probably should have been done 5 years ago. And Biden is rallying the whole world against Russia right now doing everything we can short of sending in troops. And if he sent in Troops the Trumpists would lose their minds. You're drinking your own Kool-Aid, but like most Trumpists you're to far gone to understand how far you've strayed into your own delusional dream world.",

To the deeper topic; are you trying to connect dots between republicans and Russia? I think the closer connections are the Clinton\u2019s and Russia! Why did Trump side with Putin? It wasn\u2019t that he was siding with Putin it was that he was going against the Intelligence agencies that Durham has proven to be corrupt and what Trump was saying was right!!! Not hard to go against them when what they are saying is false. It just so happened that in this instance Putin was also telling the truth. A broken watch is right twice a day!",
