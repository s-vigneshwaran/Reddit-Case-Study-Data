There SHOULD be 9. So he walks around the parking lot, thinking maybe he parked on the street, or on the other side of the school. Nothing. He cannot find this 9th bus. So he calls the driver. \n\n\"Hey, this Mr Polk, have you run into any issues with your bus, Mr Kocher?\" \n\n\"No. I'm sitting right here in the parking lot.

That's my plan. What did you think of it?\" \n\n\"Well, having never met you, and knowing that I have a murderer responsible of the safety and accountability of pre-teen school children isn't ideal. Especially knowing that our first interaction talking is about you losing said children, buuuuuut I can't stay mad at you.......I'm on medication that literally prevents that! So, get over here, you!\n\n\n\n\n\n...........No, really, get over here. With the children. This is still a pretty serious situation we have here. AND NO MURDER!\"",

My mom registered him for the correct school, but no one batted an eye when he never showed up. Then he just showed up at another school and they didn't question that he *wasn't* registered, just put him in the grade he said he was in and never followed up.

                      "text": "I mean, why though? At that point why go to the original school? Why not just keep going to the one he mistakenly went to?\n  \nI doubt there's much difference between average grades when you compare the two schools, and he'll have made lots of friends over that year he was at the wrong school and so all moving him tk a new school will do is create a lot of stress and anxiety for him. I dunno if there's ever been any studies done on it, but I bet that kids changing schools generally do worse once they do, because of all of that stress. Though maybe it's not so bad when you're not moving house or anything, just changing schools. Cos moving to a new house far away from your original one (and tk a kid even 10 miles is \"far away\") is a huge deal itself, it's very stressful and upsetting for children, especially if it's the only house and town they've ever lived in before.\n  \nI know it was like that for me. And I just moved house, didn't change schools. I had been in the original house my whole life and we only moved because my parents got divorced. It was the only house I'd ever known, I was 15 so lived there for 15 years, and it was genuinely as upsetting to me as when my grandparents died, and them dying was the worst thing that ever happened to me. I couldn't stop crying, before and after the move. I had taken loads and loads of photos of the old house, but my camera got \"lost\" in the move (we think one of the movers we hired stole it cos it was so new and expensive). So I've lost those forever.\n   \nI dunno, is it worth going through all of that just to go to a very similar school that's probably not going to make any difference to what his final grades will be? OK so you can remove the whole trauma from moving house part. But just moving schools is very traumatic in itself. Being the new kid is always difficult, you have to immediately prove that you're cool the first time you meet the tastemakers of your whole year/grade (so the few hundred people the same age as you in the same classes etc, not the whole school) otherwise you'll be labelled as lame and no matter what you do after that you'll be relentlessly bullied forever after. And being bullied like that every day can severely change someone's entire life, it's bittersweet for the victims to imagine what their life could have been like if they'd been confident and happy when they becamey adults and started their careers, trauma from bullying changes all of that, it'll give you a completely different life afterwards, your whole life determined by a handful of years when you were a kid.\n   \nAnd of course bullying victims have a very high rate of severe mental illness too which also is a life-shattering thing to deal with.\n  \nSo yeah the cool kid is under enormous pressure as it is, and they probably don't even ***realise*** that those first few schooldays at their new school will determine the outcome of the rest of their lives. They have to immediately prove that they are cool and confident, so that the tastemakers (who are usually just the bullies themselves) think they're cool and so don't ever bully them. But it's much more likely that you'll somehow fumble the ball and be instead \"proven\" to be a lame-dorknerd just because when they talked to you and asked you questions, you hesitated or stuttered just the tiniest little bit with your answers, because of course you're on edge, incredibly anxious. If you do the latter, then that's it, your whole life is changed forever, your entire life is a write-off, you're set for decades of struggle and remembering the trauma as if it was fresh even that many years later. And it doesn't matter if you were the cool kid at your last school, what happened at your last school is completely irrelevant. When I was a kid I befriended some new kids, cos I felt bad about what they were going through, and they told me they were ***the*** cool kid at their last school but became the number 1 bullying victim when they came to my school. It's hell, and they're literally children, having to deal with this stuff. Risking chronic severe mental illnesses like depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and others. \n  \nYou're risking all of that, for what? Just for a dumb technicality. The schools are probably vastly similar and wouldn't make a difference to his grades either way. Except that with the 2nd school his grades will ***definitely*** be lower because of going through all of this, as the new kid. So his grades will be worse, you're potentially gonna ruin his life, he's gonna be absolutely miserable that he can't see his friends anymore, and so on. All for the sake of having a final report card at the end of every year listing their final grades say the name of one particular school instead of another name. Both schools probably even used the same basic Microsoft word template for report cards like that, and just filled out the school name section with the name of one school instead of another. Why? What's the point? Surely, after going to the wrong school for that long, it has actually transformed into the right school, at least as far as grades and mental well-being go.\n   \nIf it was, like, a private school you'd been paying for but he'd not been attending, then I understand why the parents would want to get what they're paying for. Or it could be that the boundary lines of that county say he's technically not *allowed* to keep going to the wrong school, and so I guess not a lot can be done about that (although surely if you managed to call or write to the local mayor of the town or whoever happens to be in charge at that local level, or even like a super Nintendo, then they could be convinced to bend the rules and allow him to keep going to the wrong school he went to for a year, because it doesn't matter *that* much and it's such a crazy rare thing for a kid to mistakenly go to the wrong school for a year and so making a tiny exception like this isn't going to lead to a wave of dozens of kids who wanna do the same thing because this is probably the first and only time the people in charge of the schools will ever have to deal with a situation like this, so surely it's not a big deal to just make this one exception for your brother? I've said surely a lot)\n  \nI dunno. Seems completely out of whack. I'd have thought most parents would want their child to keep going to the same school even if just for the sake of their grades if nothing else (cos I find as an adult from people I know with kids, parents who were never bullied as kids don't seem to understand how awful it is. They don't get how it literally can change the kid's entire life for the worse, and that's not an exaggeration at all, believe me, it's why I developed schizophrenia which ruined my whole life. But yeah parents who were never victims of constant daily bullying understand that it's bad but they just seem to have no idea about the severity of it, it's not just something you can grit your teeth and get through that way).\n   \nI'm sorry I didn't intend for this to be so long, I got carried away a tad, I don't expect anyone has read this far, so I could say anything I want here and nobody would know lol",

I was also in kindergarten at the time but my parents didn't bother having me go to school those few weeks, so we would have been in different schools the next year unless I followed his path. \n\nHonestly though, starting school with only a month left sucked socially. I dont think he was bullied, but he didn't have the time to make friends. By starting fresh at the school year he was just one of several new kids in his class, and probably lots in the school, so it was way easier to fit in than being shoved into a class that was established for 8 months already. Plus he had the funny story to tell as an icebreaker.\n\nAdding to clarify bc I think you missed this part - we moved in late spring, so he only attending that school for about a month, not a whole year. If it had been a year I'm sure my mom would have needed to go to the school for something at some point and it would have been discovered.",

But I vividly remember there was a classroom in both a stairwell, a closet, and the library, which meant we could not use the library because it was someone else\u2019s classroom. But we *could* still use the stairs. I was a first grader at the time. We moved out of that town the next year.",

So that could have happened.\n\nPlus I have also heard of several universities having similar names (eg the difference between University of City versus City University) or having multiple campuses spread out over a city in a really confusing way. So like he could have gone to the X campus when he needed to be at the Y campus. Technically at the right school but at the wrong campus. But maybe they might consider them different schools because one is the Art School and one is the Science School, or they're like run by different organisations.\n\nShit happens universities can be complicated.\n\nSide note, I showed up to school on the wrong day for my first day of school because they told me a day of the week and a date that didn't match up and I didn't realise. Like they told me \"Tuesday the 30th,\" and I showed up on Tuesday the 29th. I should have shown up on Wednesday the 30th, which was the actual start date.",

We happened to move onto a road that divided boundaries for the two schools. My side of the street went to one school and the kids that lived across the street went to another school. Fast forward to the first day and my parents put my sister on the wrong bus. After what I\u2019m sure was a long day for everyone involved, the township just transferred my sisters records to what was the incorrect school, added her to a class roster, and she finished the year there. She switched back after the year for first grade and finished elementary school in the correct place.",

Nobody mentioned to my parents that that bus also brought kids to the junior high, which growing up was probably a shitty idea on their part but that's besides the point. \n\nI got into the school and was immediately lost. Had no fucking clue where to go because obviously a kindergartener shouldn't be in this school. Someone informed the principal and I was taken into the office. They got in contact with the other school and rather than calling my parents to bring me there, this guy brought me in his own car. \n\nI was kind of a dumbass as a kid and thought nothing of it, but damn I really shouldn't have been going into stranger's vehicles, and that school shouldn't have allowed this random motherfucker to bring a child that isn't his into his vehicle. All I remember from that day is the guy listening to AC/DC really fucking loud the whole way there",

The guidance office was marked as 2023, there was no 2024.\n\nAnother incident, I was supposed to go to another campus for this one class, so I got on the shuttle bus to take me to it, wrong shuttle bus. It took me to a DIFFERENT campus altogether. Still made it to the class, but holy shit.\n\nE: OH SHIT, high school prom. I thought I had the right place, but I didn\u2019t recognize anyone. Turns out the prom I was at was for a different school, and my school was literally right next door.",
