This is why UV light can cause cancer, albeit only in the skin where it can reach. \n\nOnce you get below Visible to IR and microwave frequencies, you can only heat molecules by making them vibrate or rotate. If you do this with enough photons, some of the most energized molecules can breakdown, in a process called \u201ccooking.\u201d\n\nSo your phone with microwave frequencies can \u201ccook\u201d you, but 1000x less than your microwave oven.

              "text": "So ionizing radiation is the more dangerous one for several reasons the primary being that it directly damages atoms and bonds in molecules (by stripping away electrons in a process called ionization). However ionizing radiation has an issue going through your skin to reach your organs. The danger is drastically elevated if you swallow a source of ionizing radiation because then the radiation is INSIDE your body and can more directly reach important organs. \n\nNon-ionizing radiation does its damage less directly. It can be absorbed by atoms which then end up in an elevated energy state which can mean the atom/molecule becomes more reactive. The majority of the time, these \"energized\" atoms will re-emitt the radiation and settle back down to their original energy state and no damage is done. However, occasionally, the atom/molecule will react with another before it has a chance to settle down. For example, molecules in a cell's DNA might fuse together. These reactions can then result in mutations which if combined with other mutations may then result in cancerous cells. It's important to note that one of the reasons why most non-ionizing radiation is harmless is because there is a specific, limiting criterion that must be met for such radiation to be absorbed by an atom.\n\nWhen you see horror stories of nuclear reactor disasters or nuclear weapon destruction and skin being burnt etc., that's ionizing radiation. But with those we are talking huge amounts of radiation.\n\n Most non-ionizing radiation is either reflected, passes right through you, or is harmlessly absorbed.\n\nI like to use [this xkcd chart](https://xkcd.com/radiation/) to put quantities of radiation we might be exposed to into perspective.",

These photons can have different amounts of energy, giving them interlinked properties such as wavelength and frequency. \nAnd with photons, how much energy they have determines how dangerous they are. High energy photons can damage molecular structures by ionizing them, such as DNA, causing cancer. \n\n\nNow let\u2019s set a baseline for photons I think we can all agree isn\u2019t dangerous. \nA photon with 2 electron volts of energy. This photon is completely harmless, in fact it\u2019s just orange visible light, a rather pleasant color that\u2019s easy on the eyes.\n\nNow let\u2019s compare this friendly orange photon that we see innumerable times a day, to photons emitted by electronic devices.\n\nEMF photons from running electronic devices or power lines, are usually low frequencies in the kilohertz. But these photons usually have 0.04 to 2 nano electron volts of energy. \nThis is literally billions of times weaker than our 2 electron volt orange photon.\n\nWiFi/cell phone/Bluetooth all use very similar wavelengths and frequencies, but let\u2019s stick with the infamous 5G protocol. This has a frequency of 4.7 ghz at the highest and corresponds to a photon with an energy of 20 micro electron volts. This is still almost a hundred thousand times weaker than our 2 electron volt orange photon.\n\nThe electromagnetic radiation produced unintentionally or intentionally by electronics simply doesn\u2019t have the energy to inflict molecular damage to your body and cause cancer. \n\nIf this electromagnetic radiation that is several orders of magnitude weaker than visible light causes cancer, this inexplicably implies that visible light should be a deadly instant cancer ray, sterilizing and bringing death to all forms of life for which it shines upon.\n\nHolding a cell phone to your head is no more dangerous to you than holding a tiny LED to your head, also stop pretending that electromagnetic rADiAtion doesn\u2019t also include visible light.",

Xrays and Gamma Rays *are* ionizing, so upon contact with an atom, electrons may be detached. On a base level, your cells are made of atoms. The risk with ionizing radiation is that it could break apart or corrupt the atoms that make up your DNA in a cell, causing mutation.\n       \nSubatomic particles can also carry enough energy to be ionizing, such as alpha particles, beta particles, and neutrons released from radioactive decay, but but potentially radioactive isotopes are not present in this video.",

Heat is not a property of a single system. Energy transfer can happen in many ways, including transfer of matter.\n\n> Thermal Temperature is a measure of radiation caused excitement of particles.\n\nTemperature is a measure of a specific kind of internal energy of particles. For ordinary matter, it's a form of kinetic energy. Its cause is not part of the definition. Could be caused by radiation, could be caused by anything.\n\n> Those three things you're listing are methods of which that energy (actually radiation) is transferred.\n\nYes. Correct. That's why I said \"three ways heat can spread are conduction, convection and radiation\". Not sure what your objection here is.\n\n> All heat is energy.\n\nSort of, but misleading. Heat is energy *that is being transfered* between two systems. It's not something that objects have. It's something that only exists as a process.\n\n> \"Radiation\" is radiated energy (hence the name).\n\nTrue but vacuous.\n\n> Heat is the measurable rate of exchange of said radiation.\n\nNo no no. First of all, heat is not a rate. It's an amount. The SI unit for heat is Joule not Watt. Secondly measurability doesn't have anything to do with it. Heat is still heat even if we can't measure it. And finally, and most relevant for our discussion, no, heat can be transferred by radiation but it doesn't have to be. Because, again, convection and conduction exist.",

That's why they invented the SAR test (Specific Absorption Rate test) and why you'll find a test report called a SAR report against most FCC filings for cellphones.

Every single android (and i believe apple) phone will handshake with a router and exchange basic data for the extend of the handshake. (Does the same with cell towers)\n\nThe DOJ tracks people's phones this way who have turned off network data. If you want to do sketchy stuff, make sure you turn off wifi and data. \n\nAnd i know it's minimal, but there's people who buy faraday cages for routers, grounding paint for their homes, faraday purses etc etc. It's all a scam. I dated a girl who swore she couldn't sleep if a phone was on due to wifi, but didn't turn off routers (or people living above/below/both sides). I never pressed...but it's ridiculous. You can get devices that measure em radiation, there's EM radiation everywhere, regardless of what you have on or off.\n\nI also used to live close to a em blackout area in West VA (where it's actually 100% absent). People take it seriously, most people that are paranoid about it aren't paranoid about excess, close contact, or still researching fringe cases. It's any amount.",

No laptop, wireless device, etc ever causes ionizing radiation.\n\nThe most non-ionizing radiation can do is heat you up but wifi at 0.1w or something has no chance in hell to actually do so in a meaningful way. Hell, even if that device wasnt made to standards and goes over, if it wants to cook you it literally needs a transformer bigger than your fist to get the high voltage needed to output high powered waves that could shake molecules enough to make them meaningfully heat up someone to cause damage.",

The amount of electromagnetic radiation emitted is a function (primarily) of the temperature of the object and the wavelength of radiation.   This is called \"blackbody emission\".   Not all objects are good emitters, so the wavelength dependent emissivity is at play here, but still -- for an object at 300K, you're receiving all sorts of microwave and infrared radiation.

The space station would get too hot w0ithout it. There is no air in space, so no convection. The space station is not connected to an external thing like a moon or asteroid, so no way to conduct heat into another surface. Instead it radiates it's heat in the form of infrared energy through it's cooling system.\n\nhttps://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1\n\nAll things with heat emit infrared energy.

Warm/hot things in particular tend to produce lots of infrared radiation. We can actually feel IR radiation. (eg, hold you hand next to something warm without touching it). A laptop expels much of its heat through direct contact with air (especially as the fans push air over its internal cooling fins), but it absolutely emits black-body radiation too. \n\nThe key is that normal objects' blackbody radiation is non-ionizing. In fact, none of the devices harped on in the video produce any ionizing radiation. Which means none of the radiation is dangerous in any way.",

Always let the back of the phone shield your leg from the radiation: have the screen facing out.\n\nBRB - gonna see who else in this thread I can share some insider knowledge with. Don't hate me folks... Trying to help you out here...",

The biggest reason we can only speculate on it is because it would be a horrible thing to actually do controlled testing on.\n\nThe main study itself that tends to be quoted only actually looked at if cats could survive terminal velocity falls at all if treated. It determined that the terminal velocity of a cat that is prepared was only around 60 mph and that cats falling at this speed survived at a massive rate of 90% of the time with medical intervention when it was given. A big reason for this is that cats falling from any height have a righting reflex that spins them to land on their feet, specifically at terminal velocity this reflex has shown that cats relax and orient their bodies to better sustain the landing.\n\nOf course, survivor bias DOES matter and does effect this and the true rate of survival is certainly a decent bit lower than 90% but it isn't without credence that there is a phenomenon that help cats specifically after they stop accelerating -- albeit not without great injury, dont go throwing cats off buildings. \n\nSo the most we can say is that cats can survive these sorts of falls and have reflexes that help them. There is also a phenomenon specifically at terminal velocity that we can say helps cats who reach high speeds -- it could be said a fall from 4.5 stories is probably worse than a fall from 5.5 where the cat lands worse but it is at best an assumption with very little testing done.",

One site sold a fucking chainmail suit (very dense chainmail suit), as a \"Electrosmog protection suit\" **FOR 800\u20ac?!** And other shit, like \"Electrosmog detection device\", or \"WiFi radiation repellant\" all of them Hella expensive and with one look, obviously a scam. How do people even believe in that shit, and let those people profit from that?!",

Both the remedial and college algebra were taught by the same teacher who was a math wizard. He had a PhD in \"pure mathematics\" which he described as \"math only useful for teaching other people math -- it has no real world application\". He also did college classes as a part time job, his full time job was something like forecasting finance for the Govt. He explained it to me once after class but it's been over a decade at this point. He had a real passion for what he taught. The best thing about him was if you didn't understand what he was teaching you, he could break it down 20 other ways until it clicked.",

Companies like verizon have been fighting tooth and nail to disprove it with biased studies and misleading articles, similar to how the cigarette companies said tobacco is fine, and oil companies denied the existance of global warming.  Just because its not convenient doesnt make it not true",

Despite being closer to you, your phone's signals are usually much weaker than the towers'. That's because your phone is designed to run off a very limited power source (the battery), so it has a low transmit power and very little in the way of signal amplification and filtration, relying instead on having signals from the tower that are strong enough to easily use without a large power draw. The tower, on the other hand, has a lot of power available to it (being hardwired to the electrical grid), so it can broadcast very strong signals and, thanks to power-hungry signal processing, receive very weak signals.",

So, there are many scientists who agree that this radiation is harmful to our health... Last year, we updated our review, published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, based on a meta-analysis of 46 case-control studies \u2014 twice as many studies as we used for our 2009 review \u2014 and obtained similar findings. **Our main takeaway from the current review is that approximately 1,000 hours of lifetime cellphone use, or about 17 minutes per day over a 10-year period, is associated with a statistically significant 60% increase in brain cancer.**\"](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/07/01/health-risks-of-cell-phone-radiation/)",

A moving object has kinetic energy. Radiation is an electromagnetic wave, composed of photons that carry a finite amount of energy proportional to their frequency. Heat energy is transferred when objects of different temperature come into contact. \n\nWhen an object slows down due to friction, some of that kinetic energy is converted into heat energy. When you feel the warmth of the sun, the energy in the radiation is absorbed by your skin and converted into heat energy. So kinetic energy, heat, and radiation are all different forms of energy.",

That electromagnetic energy can be converted back into thermal energy/heat, but the statement \"heat is radiation\" is not accurate. You can raise the temperature of an object through direct thermal conduction, where the heat energy flows from the hotter object into the colder, without any need for radiative energy transfer.\n\nI've published several papers on infrared physics, have taken many courses on thermodynamics, and have a doctorate in physics.",

Having the phone on the ear makes the other persons speech even more difficult to hear due to how the sound comes through from the phone. It sounds different on speaker and this easier to understand.

One of the issues is that light and radiation are complicated. Human bodies are complicated. Light and bodies interacting is even more complicated and people have a tendency to oversimplify these types of concepts because the literature around them takes a degree just to understand let alone to be able to draw conclusions from. \n\n>\tOr if she don\u2019t believe it, then why is she spreading this missinformation?\n\nI think she **does** believe it because I don\u2019t see any benefit to her convincing others to follow this advice.

The \u201cbecause it\u2019s never meant to be used in a lap\u201d part about the term is of course wrong but it\u2019s not bad advice not to use it in your lap. \n\nFor a while, our laptops only thermally controlled CPU heat sink temperature and the bottom case could easily creep into 80 deg C range. It was found that your skin around your knees are pretty bad at feeling pain from being slowly warmed so you could end up getting burned. \n\nThese days self respecting laptops do thermally control at the case temperature but that\u2019s usually handled as a best effort software control, while the hardware thermal throttling is only in response to CPU internal temperature sensors tripping a thermal fault. \n\nIn other words, honestly it\u2019s not a bad idea to avoid placing a laptop on top of your lap unless it really doesn\u2019t heat up. \n\nI\u2019m not a cancer nut but burning your lap isn\u2019t fun, and there\u2019s a good number of studies around the increased cancer incidence due to prolonged warming of your tissues (even just drinking lots of hot tea being linked to esophageal cancer) that it doesn\u2019t seem worth putting a hot plate in your lap.",

That's like saying warmth is dangerous because putting your hand on a hot plate will get you burned or that light is dangerous because you go blind if you look into the sun.

In large doses it can cause heating, like a microwave, which in turn has the potential to cause health issues over time, that's why there are limits. However, below that amount of exposure your body is capable of distributing and expelling the additional heat. We're genetically adapted to do that, because 1. we used to live in hot climates and 2. we used to have a lot of physical activity.

A photon has a set amount of energy and its energy determines its frequency. The higher the frequency, the higher the energy. \n\nIonizing radiation is called that, because its photons have enough energy to smack an electron away from the atom it's attached to, therefore ionizing the atom. If the atom now gets a new electron, a large amount of energy is released, which means the atom is storing a large amount of energy until it gets a new electron. This energy can either be used to break a bond that the ionized atom has with another atom, to create a bond with another atom or it can just radiate away again in the form of another photon.\n\nUV light does not have enough energy to break the bond between an atom and its electron, ***BUT*** it has enough energy to break the bond between atoms, because those bonds are weaker. Especially organic compounds have somewhat weak bonds, meaning UV light is enough to break them.\n\n***HOWEVER***, radio waves, microwaves and all that is used in your everyday appliances have much less energy than UV light and thus do not have enough energy to break those bonds either. In fact between the UV spectrum and radio waves lie visible light (the shit you *see with*), infrared light (aka *heat*) and microwaves (used in microwaves, in case I have to spell that out to you as well) meaning radio waves have less of a chance to damage your DNA than your own body heat. \n\nSo unless you want to kill yourself to reduce your body temperature, your cancer risk is not reduced from shutting off your phone.",

Also, those testings are performed with the maximum radiation output, you\u2019ll never hit those numbers in your day to day life.\n\nEdit: 1.6 is stil very, very far from being hazardous (50x less to be precise). \n\n[Source](https://www.rra.go.kr/en/sar/summary.do)",

Mobile phones, laptops and whatnot do not have the capasity to generate ionizing radiation or electromagnetic radiation that could warm up human tissue to endangering levels. Or at all, for that matter. \n\nhttps://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet\n\nYou are another one of those people who read the word \"radiation\" and scream cancer even if you don't know nothing about anything.",

Ionising radiation (very high frequency) can pierce through your body and hit cells until it changes the right protein to enable rapid cancer growth. Radio frequencies and WiFi are way lower frequency than the visible light spectrum, so if anything you should walk around in a reflective bag covering your whole body way before you consider doing this shit from the video. Also the reason you can get cancer from sunlight is not because of the regular visible light, it's ultra violet and other emissions. You can't get cancer from a booklight or the rgb panel on your phone(that emits photons at a higher frequency than your phone's WiFi antennas).",

Everyone on hear is creaming that cellphones are safe this is harmless, they make and sell this technology without doing any of the studies you are talking about.  Then when studies are done and they say, \"we think this causes cancer we need to run more tests for another decade or two\" everyone sees it as \"the tests couldnt proove cancer that means safe\".  And its not just cellphones, think about the dozens od wireless electronics in your house or office all beaming to each other constantly throughout the day, now take into account the dozens of people around you that all have cellphones, its not just one little trickle of radiation anymore that shit adds up and devices only get more powerful.  The truth of the matter is, there hasnt actually been that much research on the subject, but the actual scientific studies (most of which are still ongoing because it can take decades) have been leaning towards the cancer side.  The articles ive read that say shit like 5g is safe and other people are crazy all seem to be pushing a narrative and spitting out a fact or two without much scientific research backing up what theyre saying.",

                          "text": "And my point is that you will get cancer from the Sun or just existing on Earth. It is a physics problem. You recieve more EM radiation from a lightbulb than a router or cellphone. \n\nIn general it is a good idea to run studies on these kinds of things but over the years there has not been a shred of evidence that shows that low power transmitters cause cancer. \n\nWhen talking about the devices \"adding up\" there's the inverse square law to account for that. Basically even if you are in a stadium with 20,000 or more people all with a cellphone, their distance from you drops the power level you recieve down to negligible amounts. if this wasn't true the 20,000 cellphones would hit everyone in the stadium with 20,000 watts, and your premise of devices adding up means everyone in the stadium would have severe health consequences for being around that many devices. This obviously doesn't happen. In fact you would easily receive more EM radiation and power from the lights in the stadium or even the body heat given off from nearby people. So no, devices do not add up like you are thinking.\n\nAlso the power level of devices is not getting more powerful. The FCC has a power limit on consumer grade RF transmitters of 1 watt. Anything more powerful legally requires a license to opperate. This includes cellphones and routers. So at least in the US devices are not getting more powerful as you say. The reason 5G is better than previous tech is because of frequenecy. 5G has a higher frequency so it can carry more data, however, this frequency is an order of magnitude less than even regular visible light. 5G is also a low power technology. Otherwise our phones would die in mins instead of hours. \n\nThere are not very many studies done on this is because scientists understand how cancer is caused and how high energy particle interaction can sever DNA bonds. They also know that low power EM devices give off so little energy that it can not sever DNA bonds. The research is fruitless which is why not many scientists are interested in taking up the mantle. The required timeframes involved, the lack of evidence, the difficulty of trying to actually conduct a study, the physics saying it can't and many many more reasons are why there is not more research done on this topic. \n\nTo reiterate no scientific studies have found conclusive evidence that low power EM transmissions cause cancer or even increase the risk of cancer. If you have read a peer reviewed paper somewhere that states otherwise I would like to read it. I would also recommend anyone struglling with this to spend some time studying the electromagnetic spectrum and not listen to someone like me rant about it on the internet.",

I use an old massive mickey mouse book with wooden covers, that's how little you have to try. Just a solid plate that the laptop's \"legs\" (the rubber stands) can stand on to enforce airflow.",

However, if you want to remove the risk completely, moving the device slightly away from you won\u2019t make a difference.\n\nFor anyone who is actually worried about this then research Faraday cages, they contain EM radiation. Putting the phone in your purse instead of your pocket won\u2019t do shit.\n\nIf a signal can get from the device to the transmitter, then it can go through you too.\n\nAlso LOL at not using a phone in a moving vehicle.",

Probably not. You could throw an infinite number of cotton balls at the window and it wouldn't break.\n\nNow what if you threw a baseball at it? It'd probably break after just once throw.\n\nIn your body's cells, you have DNA. The DNA needs to stay intact, if it breaks in the wrong places, it can cause cancer.\n\nDNA is like the glass window. The radiation we use for communication (non-ionizing radiation) cannot cause cancer because it can't \"break the glass window\". It's just like throwing cotton balls.\n\nHowever, the type of radiation that can cause cancer (ionizing radiation) is like the baseball. It smashes apart the bonds in your DNA and makes a mess.\n\nWe cannot use ionizing radiation for communication for reasons too in-depth to explain here. It simply does not work, we couldn't really do it even if we tried. The weaker, non-ionizing radiation is much better for communication.\n\nIn conclusion, your phone, laptop, etc, will not give you cancer. it is literally more \"dangerous\" to turn on a flashlight and point it at your body than it is to have a cellphone nearby.",

Phones and laptops produce effectively no dangerous radiation.\n\nYour Iphone produces less ionizing radiation than a banana. Do bananas give you cancer? no\n\n\"don't put your phone in your pocket\" Your bag also wouldn't stop the radiation it emits anyway, even if it was dangerous. If you're worried about it being able to go through your skin from your pocket, it will likely be able to go through your bag as well. Hence why your phone can ring from inside your bag, it does not stop much radiation.\n\n\"don't have your laptop on your lap\" The highest wavelength radiation your laptop will emit is light, that's going straight into your eyes, it will not cause cancer. The other radiation it emits will also not be affected much by putting it a few extra cm away from you, because it still travels around the room, through the wall to your WIFI router lol.\n\n\"don't talk with your phone next to your ear\", already established this one: phones give off virtually no dangerous radiation, you may be at higher risk of cancer by having your ear next to dirt than to your phone lol. If you smoke, every cigarette is several times more likely to give you cancer than a phone call.\n\n\"never leave your gadgets on at night\" you have the WIFI still blaring through, same with your neighbors WIFI, your TV signal etc. This one is just pointless\n\n\"avoid using gadgets in a moving vehicle, they disconnect and reconnect with cell towers 900 times a minute\". If your phone is connected, it's still radiating, disconnecting and reconnecting doesn't make it do more or in any specific direction. Radiation is a wave with a frequency, it's not like a linear connection or not. Also you know car radios, even if turned off, it still picks up the frequency, just does nothing with it lol. \n\nHowever, one thing I do agree with her, if you are the one driving, do turn it off, focus on the road, don't get distracted, or connect bluetooth (because that doesn't harm you either)\n\n(not a professional, but a physics enjoyer and student, fact checking as I go. Feel free to correct or fact check any of this if you think I am wrong because I might be)",

The further away you are from one the better (the intensity is reduced by the square of the distance, so it's not a linear effect, and the amount reduces rapidly with distance). So keeping antennas generally a little bit further away has a significant impact on what reaches your body.\n\nIs it dangerous in the first place? Short term no, long term it's hard to say or to quantify. The exposure of the general population to radiation from phones/laptops is a recent situation, we need to wait for an average human lifespan to know if constant exposure makes any difference statistically.\n\nBut we do know that if it proves to have been dangerous, then having the device a little bit further away would have helped a lot.\n\nTL,DR: She's not completely wrong and doing as she suggests would be on the safe side.",

(Most notably in the summary.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a more general manner, I've noticed that studies involving rodents in this area of study tend to have a sample size problem.

                  "text": "This article seems to forgo the fact that we are exposed to more natural radiation than man-made radiation. Natural radiation can be more harmful. The biggest background radiation comes from the sun and it emits higher frequency radiation (most of the time ionizing radiation). Man-made radiation, apart from nuclear and x-rays, are mostly lower frequency radiation. They tend to do nothing. The reason why a lot of studies on whether or not man-made radiation is harmful or not is abandoned is because natural radiation exists outside of our control. We have no way to test man-made radiation leading to poor health conditions. We really don't have definite evidence either because most studies can't be controlled.\n\nEven in long term exposure to man-made radiation, humans are exposed to more lethal radiation our entire life. Our electronics and cell towers barely would be barely noticeable if lower frequency radiation does cause health risks.  This article making a definite conclusion is poor taste of these researchers. Most of the evidence they provide had issues with the research and state conflicting issues, especially the fact that we really can't have a controlled experiment. Is everyday radiation bad? Absolutely not. Non-ionizing radiation exists with or without man-made radiation and natural radiation has much bigger exposure to our body than man-made. Is staying on your phone 24/7 bad? Yes. But not because of radiation but because that's just bad lifestyle. Most research into non-ionizing radiation is abandoned because it's basically harmless. It's miniscule to what we are exposed to everyday. I understand your worry but there's nothing to fear. Man-made radiations except for the end-humanity bomb and x-rays are completely miniscule in long term that non-ionizing radiation being harmful or harmless is completely useless topic. \n\nThe girl also says phone, laptops, etc emit cancer causing radiation. She's absolutely incorrect because we have no evidence that non-ionizing radiation cause cancer. We do have evidence that sitting out under rather sun for long time can cause skin cancer. Natural radiation can cause harm to human. Man-made radiation? Not so much.",

The term laptop appears to have been coined in the early 1980s to describe a mobile computer which could be used on one's lap and to distinguish these devices from earlier and much heavier portable computers (informally called \"luggables\"). The term notebook appears to have gained currency somewhat later as manufacturers started producing even smaller portable devices, further reducing their weight and size and incorporating a display roughly the size of A4 paper;\\[3\\] these were marketed as notebooks to distinguish them from bulkier mainstream or desktop replacement laptops.*",

Dumpster dived for computer parts in the 90s and you get what you get, what I didn't get was a desk big enough for anything other than the gigantic monitor that was sorta fritzy.\n\nOriginal \"laptops\" were called portables (Kaypro2 and things like the Toshiba T1100 and T3100) They were so heavy you would have to set them on a desk, I tried using the T3100 a couple of times on my lap and it kinda worked, but it was just too bulky/offbalanced, it wasn't really made to sit in your lap... So yeah those weren't made for that aesthetically.  Things have CHANGED since the 90s, laptops are 100% made for your lap, and the seat back table on airplanes etc etc.\n\nOk now we can talk about ionizing radiation.  Ionizing radiation is mostly bad for you, when we use it we use it's decay waste (heat) to power things, or it's ionization to kill living things (radiated fruits/veggies so they stay longer on the shelf.). In small quantities over time it can give you cancer...\n\nWell that's no good right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell here's the other bit, ionizing radiation is BAD for modern electronics!  Like terribly bad for them.  With how tightly packed together transistors are, and how truly atomic scale the things we're building are now, a few charged particles hitting your stick or ram is often enough to bluescreen/reboot/crash your machine.  And if you to leave that ionizing source near the machine long enough it'll eventually destroy the internal electronics.\n\nThat's the same stuff I was talking about before.\n\nOk now we can get on to what RF advice a radio engineer might give you:\n\n\"Yeah having your phone in your pocket 24/7 is probably bad because that means the signal has to be \\*stronger\\* since you're occluding some of the line of sight of the signal.  (your body is a shitty conductor of RF signals.). So if you want a better signal and lower battery usage, keep it somewhere up high, and in a better all around view (in your backpack or in your hand.)\n\n\"but... micrwaves can cook things!\"   --- And this is where people freak the fuck out, well microwaves \\*can\\* cook things, because of sheer amount of power you crank into it, for perspective we used the same spectrum just following WWII to put up HUGE radar installations all over the country in the leadup to the cold war.  There were gigantic radar dishes that in some cases (from old soldier stories in the Aleutian islands) they could stand in front of them to keep themselves warm, and hop out of the way when it was getting uncomfortable.    I met a guy in his 80s who had purportedly done this, (it coulda been bullshit, but it was a passing comment so I don't think he thought enough about it to lie.)\n\nIn any case, if you've never been exposed to high power RF it hurts, it burns, it can tear your flesh away, but it won't give you cancer.\n\nIonizing radiation is wholly different from even the most extreme RF burns you could possibly imagine a cell phone giving you. (\\*which it won't unless you specifically made a phone that could do that for some reason.)",

And yeah, they were originally marketed as small portable computers, to be used at a desk, not your lap. To this day, their cooking airflow isn\u2019t really designed to be used on a lap, especially with a blanket- they often have very small bump feet to allow them to be raised so a bottom vent can have an intake and draw air along the bottom- completely defeats the purpose (and airflow is important in such a small case) if it\u2019s just smushed against something soft. Lap desks are fine. \n\nEverything else in the vid is pretty much garbage.",

      "text": "I worked in the RF test (aka Type Approval) industry for 7ish years - testing and certifying RF devices for all the top RF device manufacturers such as Apple, Motorola, Dell, Ericsson, Nintendo etc (and many, many less sexy manufacturers...) in 200ish countries of the world - and I'm sorry but many people in this thread need to be schooled on how RF works, and how RF is tested in things like cellphones and laptops.\n\nBuckle in... Taking her (mostly correct) assertions in turn....\n\n1. Don't put your phone in your pocket:\n\nPhone in pocket (with screen facing leg) gives the worst test results for radiation (i.e. RF energy entering cells) in what is called a Specific Absorption Rate test. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific\\_absorption\\_rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_absorption_rate) for info.\n\nScreen facing away from leg is what the RF test engineers I used to work with would recommend. (The back of the phone reduces energy entering your leg).\n\nPhone in bag (ideally facing away from body) is better from a radiation (i.e. RF energy entering your cells) perspective. That is testable, and known by those in the industry. The industry being: RF compliance or \"Type Approval\" for RF devices.\n\n2. Don't use laptop on your lap:\n\nThis is the least correct assessment/assertion, but you should hear her out.\n\nEssentially laptops are exempt from most RF testing because they contain radio modules, not integrated RF chips. This is different (in Type Approval circles in most countries around the world) to tablets and cellphones - for NO good reason, I should add.\n\nIt seems like most countries around the world basically agreed that: laptops are too beneficial to our economy to test individually; they're too diverse, too different between models, to test the laptop: instead we will only demand testing be done on the RF modules themselves.\n\nThis approach is used in LOTS of devices that use PCI/PCIE modules; the module gets tested, the host device does not.\n\nWhen she says \"laptops weren't designed to be used on your lap\" she really should be saying \"laptops aren't tested for RF emissions, so you might be at risk if you use them close to your body\". But the reality is that the modules HAVE been tested (though not for SAR, oftentimes, in the destination country - typically the self-certification reports for FCC or EU are used instead) and so the laptop is incredibly unlikely to make the emissions worse, and so it generally won't matter whether you use it on the desk or on your lap.\n\nI think what she's getting at here is that use on a pillow or a lap (usually covered in clothing...) blocks the ports, causes the laptop to increase it's heat/fan speed, stressing out the laptop and potentially causing heat in the area of the body closest to the laptop. The emissions caused by RF radiation are measured using how they heat up cells in the body (used by a saline fluid proxy, in a SAR test machine), so adding heat to body cells is generally a bad idea.\n\nIndeed - I've been party to some devices (from famous manufacturers) who failed tablet tests (SAR tests - see wiki link above) at certain radio power levels. The manufacturers had to implement a fix to reduce the power level in order to pass the test. This is pretty standard in the Type Approval space - the testing is there for a reason; not all devices match their configs from the FCC/EU initial testing; not all radios are exactly the same from the factory. The FCC/EU testing might use slightly different test setups to the local countries etc etc.\n\nBasically - heat is THE mechanism used to test this stuff - please know this. These tests are done all over the world, today, to protect users. Most people in this thread seem to have no knowledge of this. There is an entire industry dedicated to testing and protecting against this stuff. Turn over any device with wifi or a cellphone radio - and find an FCC or CE mark, and you know it has been through some kind of similar testing.\n\n3. Don't use your phone next to your head:\n\nThere's a specific type of SAR test relating to the head (and another for \"body SAR\"); they have different limits. The head SAR rules are much stricter (because they value your brain more than your thigh, not surprisingly). If you CAN avoid using the phone next to your head, it will help you avoid cancer.\n\nThat said - SAR tests are done on phones and no phone can be sold in your country (certainly USA, EU and most other countries of the world; my company used to deal with 200+ countries back in the day, that's \"normal\") without passing the tests, and those tests have a safety margin. So the chances of you ACTUALLY getting cancer from the phone are - thankfully - really low. But they're not zero, so, arguably, she's right here - and all the people arguing she's wrong in the comments are just ignorant of the science/testing that goes into this stuff.\n\n\\*OH\\* PS - when a phone detects it is close to your head (i.e. close to anything), it ramps down the radio power, so by putting it on the table (e.g. on a train)(and face up, so it has higher light levels) you're likely to get better signal, because it will be maximum power. So that's another benefit to using it on the table, as she shows.\n\nSource - I have read a very famous phone manufacturer's probably very private patent and I've read about how it detects the proximity of things, and ramps the RF power level down if it might be near a person. This was part of their FCC filing (I think... this was 10 years+ ago now).\n\n4. Set your gadgets to flight mode at night:\n\nYeah - I do this. I go on flight mode. Partly to guarantee no overnight vibrations, partly to eliminate RF emissions near my head. It's just common sense. The less devices you have in your house using e.g. 2.4GHz spectrum, the better things like Bluetooth headphones, DECT phones, and other things will work. This is just basic physics. It also saves you electricity, because your phone's radio will be checking in with the wifi AP and the cellphone tower regularly, so by going on flight mode, your phone will charge less. It's basically a no-brainer, so everyone who doesn't need their phone to be using its radios should do this.\n\n5. Avoid using gadgets in a train/car.\n\nYep - 100% right. Your cellphone is capable of \\~1W or \\~2W radiated power typically (I think the standard is like up to 4W radiated? Someone from EMC land will tell me I'm sure) and when you're on a train or car (i.e. in a metal cage) it's screaming its damn head off trying to talk to multiple towers to preserve your signal and protect data quality. This is why when you use your phone on a train it absolutely rinses the battery. It's the worst possible time to put a phone next to your head, AND if the phone detects it is next to your head (as previously mentioned), it may ramp down on power, and you won't get as good signal quality.\n\nSo use on table if possible.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI suspect this person works in an RF test lab or knows the EMC/EMR industry and is sharing some pretty obvious, easy to understand tips to reduce the likelihood of the downsides of very powerful radio devices. She should really limit the video to cellphones (since these are used next to the head, most commonly), but including some tips for laptops seems reasonable (even if it weakens her overall point somewhat).\n\nY'all need to understand that radiation or \"Electromagnetic Radiation\" or EMR is the \\*\\*\\*correct\\*\\*\\* term for what it is that your laptop and cellphone radios do.\n\nSee [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic\\_radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation) for why (ironically) most of the people in this thread are mis-interpreting what this person is expressing in this video.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\[Edited multiple times for formatting. Also to add - that patent was part of very-NDAy documentation for the device - I presume you could look it up, nowadays, I'm not sure on that bit. The manufacturer seemed very keen to keep the tech under wraps back then, anyway.\\]",

      "text": "Simple science by an American student who passed 9th grade last year:\n\n1.   Our phones emit non-ionizing radiation. That means it CANNOT change increase or decrease  the amount of protons, neutrons or electrons in a atom. It cannot change create a chemical change of a atom.\n\nProtons are for our purposes are just very small things that have a positive charge. Thing of it like a magnet. Similarly there are also negative(electrons) charged things and neutral(neutrons) things in the atom as well.  These all need to be in balance in order to be a stable element. Helium for example is a element and has an atom with 2 protons and 2 electrons and 2.  It is stable. If it were to get one more proton, it would be unstable. If it loses a proton, it would be unstable. It\u2019s like if you were to lose your morning coffee, or take an extra dose of  cocaine. Everything needs to be in balance, so when extra is put or something is taken, it is unstable. This can cause radiation or emission of one if the particles in order ti restore balance. In essence, if you lose a negative electron, a proton will be ejected after some time. Nukes are very bad because it causes a domino effect with the exchange of energy and particles, causing the nearby atoms to revive this extra energy and release some of their particles as well. Cool thing is that these atoms will split again and again because they keep giving energy and getting hit again and again, splitting each time eventually creating a stable, and much smaller element.\n\nSo now that you know this, it\u2019s time to put it all together. The fact that this woman thinks that this a fucking iPhone battery can cause radiation   \npoising shows how she thinks she\u2019s the main character of the show. I didn\u2019t spend one whole year learning about fucking atoms to be told that my phone could kill me. Maybe she should say that to herself with her fucking vibrator stuck up her ass, and someday look at the battery inside it\u2026 AND THINK. If its near you everyday, you would be dead according to herself.This bitch gets no men for a reason and try\u2019s to act smart on social media. Fatherless asshole is trying to scare people, and then teach them pseudo-science.\n\nPeople actully do believe this when they watch this, and it causes panic, and it causes bad stuff to happen in the world like baby killers and terrosits and flat earthers.\n\nNext time try sucking dick before saying you\u2019ve done it, and learning it before teaching it.",

That being said, the radiation or whatever electromagnetic energy being put out decreases very rapidly over small distances so a Phone being near your body (sleeping with it on your nightstand, in a purse etc) but not right on it would be fine. He did say bluetooth headsets would be safer since they are only communicating a few feet to your phone. I had this conversation with him like 15 years ago so sorry for not knowing the details. I also didn't talk to him much about the science of his work as an adult so I forgot what kind of energy etc. Also he was not a doctor ofc and he never said it was dangerous, just that he was concerned about the energy being right up on the body.",

And in that respect the method of heat transfer whether convection, conduction or radiation does not matter.\n\n>The sun heats things too and in a much more similar fashion to radio waves... and causes cancer.\n\nThe heat isn't causing the cancer, its the *ionizing* UV-A/B rays from the sun that cause cancer.\n\n>we don't know the long term effects too well yet.\n\nRadio waves have bathed humans for well over a century now. The power emitted by ground stations like your local AM station is many, many times greater than the power emitted by your cellphone or other consumer electronic. We know the long term effects.\n\n>Claiming that lack of evidence is evidence of no harm is a fallacy.\n\nTrue, but this isn't in conflict with what my point was: you'll never find a definitive answer in medicine. However, due to the paucity of evidence showing a causal link between exposure to radio waves and developing disease at this point it's quite reasonable to assume that there likely is no effect present. Furthermore, when we're talking about cancer, physics does tell us that radio waves are not energetic enough to cause changes in DNA which is almost always necessary for developing cancer.\n\nYou keep bringing up leaded gasoline and cigarettes. In both those cases we've shown the pathophysiology of disease caused by both, there is none with radio waves. Your argument here is that basically anything and everything should be considered suspect for causing disease. Rain? Fog? Nitrogen? How do we know those don't cause cancer or disease either?",

These devices do emit radiation in the form of radio, low frequency microwave, infrared (from the heat), light and UV from screens as well as heat, and all electronics have varying amount of beta radiation (free electrons) though this is pretty negligible. All these radiations are designed out of the electronic devices and directed away from the user as much as possible, but the closer to your body that you keep them, the more risk of developing cancer you have. Keep the laptop or games controller away from your crotch, turn off the unnecessary radiating functions on your phone like wifi (when out and about), bluetooth, nfc, etc. And always have your phone pointing towards you. The radiation (to get the best signal) is designed to be strongest coming out of the back of the phone.\n\nOk, just gotta say. You're all idiots! And yes I am a fully qualified electrical engineer with years of experience in dealing with RF and EMF.",
