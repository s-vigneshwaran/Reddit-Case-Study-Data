This sounds counterintuitive but here's what I've seen with some of my relatives:  When they go to church, they're told what to believe and in order to maintain a large enough base of followers the church leadership has to try to appeal to at least somewhat mainstream views.  Your typical middle class family in the suburbs isn't likely to attend a church that focuses on JFK coming back to life in Dallas or how Bill Gates put invisible 5G chips in medicine that was made in Germany.  It's just too ridiculous and most people would be repelled by that.  As a result, church membership kept some of the craziest ideas in check to a limited degree, and as a result kept some people from becoming more extreme in their views.\n\nAs a result of people leaving churches in accelerating numbers, a lot of people who have little to no critical thinking skills have been cut adrift without a paddle.  They get their news from the internet and from extreme TV networks that cater to whatever amount of nonsense that they will believe in -- this can range from political extremism that isn't physically impossible (e.g. the big lie), to actually batshit insane stuff (flat Earth).  This also significantly blurs the lines between their religious ideas and general political ideas, as well as everything else in between.  \n\nThere's no foundational doctrine and everyone can go belief shopping whenever they want.  They change ideas often without realizing it, believing that they are consistent because their core ideology is one based on their feelings of rage rather than real ideas.  For many of us that view subreddits like this one, we came from a religious background, went through a process, then came out the other side often with an affinity for science and logic.  Obviously not all atheists do that, but those of us that went through such a process tend to believe that's what happens to most of us.  Instead, a significant number of people just jump from one crazy belief system to another, because they never understood the foundational logical problems in the first place.\n\nIn any case sorry for going off on a long reply to a one sentence comment but I think it's dangerous to underestimate the situation people can find themselves in when they leave organized churches.  We're seeing a lot of people who are replacing something bad with something worse.",

They used a lot of horrific techniques used to keep people in compliance.  I was faced with the idea of being basically not just excommunicated from my religious group but from my actual family if I had even so much as asked the wrong questions to the wrong person.  \n\nIn any case, what really planted the seeds of doubt in my mind was reading Carl Sagan's book \"The Demon Haunted World\" after I really liked the movie Contact and read the book.  Especially after reading about the dragon in his garage I really couldn't help but question more and more of the Bible and I felt like the scales fell from my eyes (to use religious terms) and eventually I couldn't help but not be a part of that religion anymore.\n\nHowever, despite being a fan of science and reading more books like Sagan's, I found myself veering into some wacky territory.  I really liked the whole UFO thing and a friend eventually turned me onto a book by Zecharia Sitchin that seems like it was the inspiration for the \"Ancient Aliens\" TV show.  I also remember watching Fahrenheit 9/11 or whatever that was and falling into the narratives exposed there too, when it comes to 9/11 conspiracy theories.  I hadn't yet developed my personal sense of logic and a good understanding of how to research things beyond what was presented to me.  I was also still very na\u00efve and couldn't comprehend that someone could make a compelling case for utter bullshit.\n\nUltimately, it took probably a decade after leaving my religious background, through a lot of effort to develop my logic, my skepticism, my research abilities, and my general understanding of how things work to try to catch up to what seems to be innate to a lot of well educated people.  I'm still far from perfect and nobody I grew up with that has left the same cult I was in has gone in the direction I have.  The closest is probably one of my siblings but they still had to replace the cult for a more mainstream church.  Deprogramming is not easy and I don't think it's something people can easily do without help.",

I learned to cope by pretending they are dead. Not nice, but it's a way of coping. And it took me a solid decade to get to a place where my head was screwed on right.\n\nI love Carl Sagan. And Christopher Hitchens. Wish I knew about them when they were alive.\n\nAnd yes, deprogramming is extremely hard. It takes a lot of work and time. And no two people are the same. I have seen people I grew up with fall back into another religion after leaving. I think on some level it's easier to tell yourself well that group got it wrong, but these people don't believe that... And next thing you know you traded one lie for another. Looking at the bigger picture is hard. Especially when everyone you know is a believer. It can be a lonely road depending on your circumstances.",

There aren't alot of community groups or clubs for people to belong to if they leave the church and aren't prepared for the lack of support that some of them might suddenly face and not be used to. They are more  vulnerable to being picked up by one extremist fringe group or another even if the group isn't directly religious since we as a society often don't offer much for them to belong to besides organized religion these days. \n\nI would hear alot about this issue in undergrad with alot of courses in political science/political theory. There's a famous book called \"Bowling Alone\" that discusses how a lot of the social groups and clubs that were popular in the mid-20th century (ex. bowling leagues, Elks Lodge, VFW, etc.) have basically collapsed which has caused our social capital to diminish greatly with the exception of church organizations or social events with co-workers. \n\n I could see how having alot of these more secular social organizations and clubs receiving little support or new members today could drive people towards more extremist groups (or to more cultlike religious groups) if they are really dependent on support structures like that. I guess you could say that having nothing to replace the church for some people who need that support can cause some issues in societies like ours that really no longer emphasize those types of connections in real life.",

During WW2 the priest of the French volunteer unit fighting on the eastern front under a German uniform with a French shoulder patch refused to wear it because the only flag of France was the white banner with Fleurs de Lys.

Or wouldn't think. Idk. \n\nUS politics is [run by a small select](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746) few of very powerful mem and women.\n\ndon't conflate who wins presidency, who sits in congress, who sits in scotus, or who sits in local government as popular opinion.

The Catholic church control most of the public schools, and in many cases the educate together schools have to bargain and deal with the church to use church owned facilities.\n\nIn one case, parents of children going to an educate together school were told their students wouldn't be able to start the term at the school because the catholic church decided that they need the space the educate together school was using, so they didn't have the room for all of the students they had planned to enroll.\n\nNot only that, but when I was in school, I was regularly told that \"If you didn't want a catholic education, you shouldn't have come to a catholic school\". Which is bullshit, since the only options I had *were* catholic schools (I didn't get a place in the educate together school).",

To my knowledge there is a process that must be followed to be granted permission for homeschooling.\n\nThe person I know who was homeschooled did a PLC when they were meant to be in 6th year. They then used those points to get into university so they managed to avoid the leaving certificate all together.\n\nThroughout my schooling years I moved around Ireland a lot and attended many schools (all of which were Catholic, primary & secondary). These schools aren't awful but they definitely have religious practices and classes that have no place in schools (especially for young children).\n\nPersonally I'd guess that the limited social interaction of homeschooling would be more damaging than the Catholic practices that your children will endure, should they attend a Catholic school. Even when I was in school the children didn't take religion seriously and most are smart enough to not fall for it (when I was in secondary school I'd assume about 5% of my year were religious, and maybe only 2% seriously).\n\nEither way, best of luck to you and your family!",

This was bizarre to me (In the US, these schools are supposed to be separate from religious schools).  But she seemed to think this was a normal German thing in the Catholic regions of the country.\n\nWell, after the regular teacher left, there was some time before the priest came into the room. One kid realized if he went into one of the cubbies he wouldn't be missed as the priest wasn't paying attention or taking attendance, and he much preferred relaxing in the dark to religious classes.  Before long, the cubbies were filling.  \n\nEventually the class was half empty (my wife was too afraid to climb into her own).  Someone eventually coughed or cleared their throat, and the priest went to a cubby and discovered a kid in there.  He started opening the others to find the rest of the missing students.  She doesn't remember them getting in trouble, probably because the priest would look foolish confessing such a thing.",

As someone who grew up adjacent to these kinds of families, trust me when I say it's almost impossible to fail when your family is bending over backwards to bankroll your success, academically or otherwise.\n\nHell, I lived down the street from a kid who came from a rich family, he had private tutors, lots of extra curriculars, and his family even paid for a private martial arts instructor to come to their house multiple times a week for training instead of going to one of the many dojos around town. Not that any of this is bad, but man, having all this support, it would be nearly impossible to fail.",

It was to prepare for the First Communion and in my class about 20% did that including me. I can guarantee that in my class at least nobody really got what it was all about. Nobody actually believed the stories. It didn't help that we had some sort of assignment book that was themed after [Jip and Janneke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jip_and_Janneke) who are pretty simple book characters with no religion included at all. Makes me wonder if they even licensed it.\n\nWe were all excited about it though. We were promised gifts! I got more gifts than I got for my birthday. One classmate got an expensive PC!

Things like communion and confirmation aren't really about devoting yourself to your faith so much as a rite of passage for young kids in Ireland. It's a big deal here, kids make so much money, get a party, get toys, get to visit their whole extended family. It's as big as a 21st in America in its cultural significance. \n\nAll year in second class and sixth class, they get time off class to practice. They get roles, they learn songs, they go on trips to the church and stop and get McDonald's on the way back. It's a milestone for them. While a lot of people are all for moving away from strict Catholic ideology being the foundation of the country, a lot less people would be supportive of abolishing catholism in primary schools because they want their kids to experience those events, even if the family as a whole aren't religious. \n\nAs for the adults, there's huge parties and meals to celebrate, most parties are held in pubs and they get locked and have a sing song, there's a DJ and music and a dancefloor. The whole family gets in for pictures and afterwards the school will hold a picture day where they wear their special clothes and get a professional portrait done of their child that people pass down for generations. \n\nThe majority of kids in Ireland would be heartbroken if that was to be phased out, a lot of adults would push back on it. I don't see that happening any time soon. It's a huge part of the national identity and culture, that's why it's not even really being considered as a factor",

And let me reiterate the land and buildings these schools are on are the *property* of these religious institutions. These schools teach their religion as a subject during school hours.  Outside of any urban center most children have no options other than a religious school. Even within any city it is difficult to get into the few secular public schools.

When you remove the silly things like the Queen owning countries her property is still complicated. She essentially owns things as if she were three different people:\n\n1. The Crown Estate\n2. The Duchy of Lancaster\n3. Elizabeth Windsor\n\nThe Crown estate is a set of properties owned by the \"Crown\".  The sovereign legally owns these properties but she willingly signed over all the profits from these lands to the government in return for a fixed annual stipend that amounts to roughly  a quarter of the annual profits. These lands total roughly 300,000 acres. A new monarch is under no *legal* obligation to sign over these lands but every monarch has done so for nearly 300 years.\n\nThe Dutchy of Lancaster is the private estate of the British sovereign. The sovereign is entitled to the profits of this portfolio and can manage it as she likes but she is not entitled to the capital or any profits from the sale of the capital as those are the property of the estate and are held in trust for the next sovereign. However the cash profits *can* be used to buy property that is hers and not the property of the Dutchy. These lands are roughly 50,000 acres in size.\n\nAs a regular person she has a bunch of properties she owns. These include two estates bought by her ancestors. Balmoral in Scotland (50,000 acres) was bought by her great grandfather Prince Albert (who was not a monarch) with his own money and it passed to his eldest son on his wife's (Queen Victoria) death. Sandringham (20,000 acres) was bought by QEII's grandfather, Edward II, from profits his estate accrued while he was a child (The Prince of Wales has the Dutchy of Cornwall that acts similarly to Lancaster in function).  Theses estate had to be bought from Edward VIII by his brother when he abdicated as they had no legal connection to the monarch. Since then QEII has made a ton of investments with the profits from these private holdings as well as the profits of Lancaster. As it turned out buying land in the last 70 years was a good investment. She also made a bunch of money off of horses and other enterprises.\n\nShe claims to pay taxes but she is never audited because she legally isn't obliged to pay them so we don't really know quite how much land she owns but somewhere in the ballpark of half a million acres seems reasonable.",

In Senior Cycle it just turned into our CSPE class. We talked about war, abortion and death penalty stuff. I live in Cork, close to the city centre tho so I imagine it might be more tightly run in the countryside.\n\nMy point is that a lot of people attend these catholic schools because they have a pretty good reputation, not because they're Catholic.

      "text": "When the Irish drove out the British colonizers about a hundred years ago what remained was weak in terms of government and governance - except the Church had been there for hundreds of years too. \n\nThe Church was a powerful institution with a deeply devout population, and so it was literally written into the constitution of the country that was new to being a nation-state. Not only did the Church dominate the spiritual life, it dominated the political life, and education, and hospitals, and it was a huge landowner. (NB: England and France had violent land reforms that wrested away the land holdings from the Church. Ireland never had that.)\n\nBut it provided little to no moral leadership for much of the late 20th century, at a time when there was a lot of violence and civil strife. As a new generation grew up and wanted change, it began to question the Church. The Church\u2019s response was basically stfd and stfu, we are the Church and you are Ireland so you will do what we say. This was not an appropriate response to an increasingly educated and politically aware populace.\n\nSo that populace started to change things, first with a constitutional referendum to allow divorce. (Divorce had been not just illegal but actually unconstitutional.) The Church strongly resisted that, but lost. And that showed that the power of the Church could be beaten.\n\nThen, around the world the revelations of the Church being complicit in serious abuse began to come out in basically all the Catholic countries. And it began to come out in Ireland too, but it was arguably far worse. What also came out in Ireland was the inhuman treatment of unmarried mothers and their babies and children. These people were turned into slaves in institutions literally owned and run by the Church. Many died. The ones that did not die were sepal and the children were adopted out, the mothers were sent away, shamed and humiliated, without their children or even a community to go home too. And there was no abortion as that was unconstitutional too.\n\nThe only way to get an abortion was to go across the sea to England and get an abortion there, where it was legal. But that took time and money and if one was poor or without the means to take several days off for travel and lodging and medical procedures it just didn\u2019t happen. Then, a medical emergency happened to a young female doctor. She was Indian, working in Ireland. (I believe she was Hindu.) Her pregnancy spontaneously aborted and began to go septic. She was taken to the hospital and needed emergency surgery to remove the mass that was now poisoning her - but the Catholic hospital refused to perform or to allow the procedure. She was a doctor and knew what needed to be done to save her life. She begged, but the doctors and the hospital refused. She died.\n\nThis was a huge scandal, especially coming as it did around the time of priests being pedophiles and nuns running slaving and torture houses.\n\nThe people went back to the constitution and with another referendum made birth control legal (it had been constitutionally illegal) and also legalized abortion.\n\nThe Church had been deeply committed to the wrong side of criminality and immorality for a long time, and the young populace of this young country started to say \u201cno more\u201d. But it wasn\u2019t just the young people. Many of the middle aged and old people who had had to silently tolerate the dominance of the Church began to not only vote, but to fall away from the institution. \n\nIn fact the two major political parties that had run the country with the cooperation of the Church began to lose much of their constituency to the third party that had been around for a long time but had been demonized by the Church for their stand on divorce, birth control, and abortion. They had also been shunned by the other parties because they were not for the status quo, but for change, and for reuniting the country.\n\nThe people of the country still need to reform their systems of education and health care, as well as restructure many political, social, and economic structures - and it looks like they are slowly achieving things.",

This would take up a considerable amount of time, in which those who weren't Catholic were thrown into another class, receiving no education and often told to \"read a book\", essentially entertain yourselves.\n\nThis waste of time was also added upon by the amount of preparation we would do IN CLASS. And don't forget morning prayers. And if you had a hardcore religious person for your teacher, you were pretty much fucked education-wise no matter your beliefs.\n\nIt's insane that young Irish people aren't more thick considering how much valuable education time was wasted doing religious bollox.\n\nOh yeah, and secondary school religious class was near impossible to get out of.

I especially think Buddhism and Indigenous religions are beautiful. You can be against the anti lgbt sentiments in some religions and the corruption or issues within it and still not say it\u2019s trash. \n\nBut if you say all Catholics support pedophiles you\u2019re spreading hate and divisiveness.

I went to a Catholic school (Marist Brothers founded it) and we had protestant and muslim kids in my year. Our religion classes (40 mins once a week) were spent watching movies or having table quizzes. We had sex education where contraceptives were recommended too. This was 20+ years ago.",

      "text": "Ah it isn't so bad in Ireland. If you're a yank you probably have a more Old Testament idea of what it's like in a \"Catholic School\". \n\n\nReally it's just you say a prayer when you get in, before you eat, and before you go home. This is Primary Schooling from 4-12 years old. You will usually learn a parable during the week (prodigal son...etc) or some  songs.\n\n\nThen the school organises your First Communion for when you are 8, and your Confirmation for when you are 12 which are big enough religious events. They're more treated as a reason to throw a party for the adults and hire out a bouncy castle for the kids.\n\n\nWhen you arrive into the Secondary Schooling from 13-17/18 religion becomes a twice a week class. It stops being a Catholic thing and becomes a thing about world religions. You learn about the structure of other religions and how it affects people's cultures. Usually it involves getting speakers in for different religions and field trips to any places of worship. (Synagogue, Mosque, etc...)\n\n\nQuite generally the problem is that Catholic Primary Schools are just way better than non-Catholic ones because they have much better support and better funding. This means that parents will try their hardest to get their children into them. I've heard of it happening where a protestant family from England would get their child baptised to ensure they are guaranteed a spot. But it's also very frequent that if their is for example enough Muslim children then they will usually be taken out and taught their own stuff.\n\n\nThe Catholic Church lost major credibility because of the huge pedophile scandal and young people generally voting against their most oppressive laws. The only ones that are effecting young people is Alcohol sale times which I don't give a shite about really.",
