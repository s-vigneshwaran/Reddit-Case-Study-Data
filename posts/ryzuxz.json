I was always polite and respectful with my words.   Never personally insulted anyone and never returned any of the many personal insults I recieved.  Never broke any of their rules.\n\nWhen I replied to the ban notice in DM I asked \"Why I was banned?  I broke none of your rules.\"   The mod replied,  **\"We don't tolerate trolls!\".**",

I never said anyone should force a private business to engage it speech they don't want to because I don't believe that.\n\nThe context of my comment was someone saying that although they believe in free speech they believe a sub should be shut down, and then someone else interjecting that the first amendment only applies to the government.\n\nSo let's break that down, I guess. One could decide that they believe in free speech in the context of subreddits, and that moderation or censorship should be as minimal as possible to maintain the focus of that sub, healthy discourse, and uphold basic ethical and moral values.\n\nIt's then possible to apply that standard to the Fauci for prison sub and decide \"even though free speech is an important concept to me, the harm caused by this sub is sufficient that I would support Reddit shutting it down.\n\nNowhere in that equation does the first amendment, government intervention, or anything like that come up. Nonetheless, the second the words \"free\" and \"speech\" appear together in a sentence, people always jump in to say \"ackshually the first amendment only protects you from the government\" even though that has nothing to do with what's being discussed.\n\nThis then makes it impossible to even mention or discuss the value of free speech without getting the same copy-pasted response that adds nothing to the conversation, as happened toward the top of this thread.",

No, that's not true: The article is misleading because it leaves out the important fact that Scotland has high vaccination coverage. According to the latest figures, more than 91% of people over the age of 18 in Scotland had have at least one dose of a COVID vaccine. As no vaccine is 100% effective, it stands to reason then that in a place where the vast majority of people are vaccinated, most deaths would be among those vaccinated. **And while the percentage sounds high, the absolute number of deaths is not: 123 people died of COVID that month in Scotland.**\n\nThe article (archived here) was published by The Daily Expose on September 8, 2021. Titled, \"EXCLUSIVE - 80% of Covid-19 deaths in August were people who had been vaccinated according to Public Health data\", the article opened:\n\nFurther evidence proving the Covid-19 vaccination programme is a huge failure has been released which confirms throughout the whole of August 80% of the people who allegedly died of Covid-19 had been vaccinated against the disease. Users on social media saw this at the time of writing:\n\nThe article cites statistics from Public Health Scotland, Scotland's national public health agency. It considered data from two agency reports, published in August 2021 and September 2021. Comparing the figures in Table 17 in both reports, the article concluded that the number of COVID-19 related deaths by vaccination status between August 5 and August 26, 2021, was as follows:\n\nUnvaccinated population: 25 deaths Partly vaccinated population: 6 deaths Fully vaccinated population: 92 deaths The article continued:\n\nThis means the unvaccinated population have accounted for just 20% of alleged Covid-19 deaths throughout the whole of August, whilst the fully vaccinated accounted for 75% of them. But couple the partly vaccinated deaths with the fully vaccinated deaths and you can see that throughout August 80% of deaths occurred among the vaccinated population.\n\nAlthough the article's math is not wrong, the story is highly misleading because it does not address Scotland's vaccination coverage. According to the latest figures, more than 91% of people over the age of 18 in Scotland had have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and more than 84% have had two doses. With such high coverage, it makes sense that most deaths would be among those vaccinated since most Scots are vaccinated.\n\nImagine, for example, if every single person in Scotland were vaccinated. In that case, 100% of COVID-19 deaths would be among those who had had the shot.\n\nNo vaccine is 100% effective, but the approved COVID-19 vaccines have been shown to significantly reduce one's chance of getting the disease and of getting very sick. In fact, the same report cited by The Daily Expose contradicted the article's claim that Scotland's vaccination program is a \"huge failure.\" The Public Health Scotland report read (see page 40):\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are estimated to significantly reduce the risk of mortality for COVID-19, however a small number of COVID-19 deaths are still expected in vaccinated people, especially in vulnerable individuals where the vaccine or the immune response may not have been effective. Evidence has shown that vaccination is highly effective in protecting against death from coronavirus (COVID-19). Data published by Public Health England (PHE) has shown that individuals who receive a single dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the AstraZeneca vaccine have approximately 70 to 85% lower risk of death with COVID-19 compared with unvaccinated individuals. Vaccine effectiveness against mortality with 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine is around 95 to 99% and with 2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine around 75 to 99%. Modelling analysis from PHE estimates that 105,900 deaths have been prevented in England as a result of the COVID-19 vaccination programme, up to 20 August.\n\nLead Stories reached out to Public Health Scotland to ask about the article. We will update this story, as appropriate, if we receive a response.\n\nWe have debunked claims published by The Daily Expose before. See here and here for those stories, in which we found that vaccine \"candidates\" transferred in December 2019 were not for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, and that official data does not show that more people have died from the vaccines than from COVID-19.",

The journal that published the study that erroneously claimed support from the NIAID has since issued a correction. So, the claims that Fauci funded a study that sedated and let beagles get eaten alive by flies are inaccurate.\n* Two other studies testing potential vaccines and treatments for humans ended with the beagles in the study being euthanized. In one, the dogs also had their vocal cords cut. The NIAID said all animals used in NIH-funded research are protected by laws, regulations and policies that were followed in these studies.\n\nhttps://www.politifact.com/article/2021/oct/28/unpacking-noise-around-dr-anthony-fauci-and-beagle/",

The subjects covered vary from how cults work to how diamonds are made to, you guessed it: pandemics.Since hindsight is always 20/20 (no pun intended), we decided to watch an episode titled \u201cThe Next Pandemic,\u201d which provided us some scarily accurate predictions about the pandemic we are currently experiencing. Here\u2019s what the episode got right, and what advice we ignored.  \n>  \n>**A pandemic is in our near future & it is most likely to come from a zoonotic virus**  \n>  \n>The episode starts off by presenting the ways in which the world could end\u2014and then Bill Gates determines that a pandemic is the most plausible event to occur. The episode claims that the stakes for a pandemic have never been higher, estimating that out of 1.5 million unknown viruses, public health researchers only know of 3,000 (less than 0.1%). Additionally, the team predicts that the pandemic will come from a zoonotic virus\u2014one that originates from animals and transfers to humans.  \n>  \n>**The virus could likely be spread to humans in a wet market**  \n>  \n>Due to the nature of wet markets, animal blood (and viruses) can be easily spread because animals are killed on site. These different species are in close quarters, allowing their viruses to mix and mutate. This results in increased odds of human transmission, according to the episode. COVID-19 likely originated from bats in a wet market in China.  \n>  \n>**Technology is always responsible for the rapid spread of viruses**  \n>  \n>Every historic pandemic has spread due to human technology. Per \u201cExplained,\u201d the Black Death, a combination of bubonic plague and pneumonic plague, reached Europe through ships. The 1918 flu pandemic emerged in the middle of WWI, allowing the virus to spread as troops traveled transatlantically. Smallpox, tuberculosis, measles and other diseases also became pandemics due to human travel.With more efficient tech than ever before, viruses can travel around the world in days, easily erupting into a full-fledged pandemic. Although it originated in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 quickly spread due to international flights. Over 500 international flights took off everyday in 2003 in Hong Kong at the onset of the 2002 pandemic, a figure which only multiplied in 2020, according to the episode.  \n>  \n>**The death toll will be severe**  \n>  \n>A modern pandemic will have an unbelievable cost to humanity and no country would be immune, Bill Gates said. Unfortunately, this prediction certainly came true, and COVID-19 continues to take many lives throughout the world. The episode estimated that a pandemic today could 33 million people in 6 months. According to Johns Hopkins\u2019 Mortality Analysis, there have been approximately 1.25 million deaths due to COVID-19.  \n>  \n>**The economy will be shut down**  \n>  \n>According to Bill Gates in the episode, the next pandemic would cause the economy to shut down. A global survey conducted by BBC recorded these huge falls in the stock market due to COVID-19. The Dow and the FTSE had their biggest quarterly drops since 1987. There has also been a significant rise in unemployment rates, with the United States, Italy and France being hit hardest.  \n>  \n>**The advice we didn\u2019t listen to:**  \n>  \n>**Adequate Government Funding**  \n>  \n>Based on the critique of the response to the Ebola outbreak in Africa, Obama expanded the National Security Council to include the Directorate of Global Health Security and Biodefense in 2016. In 2018, the Trump administration restructured the National Security Council resulting in the disbandment of the global health unit. There were a limited number of infectious disease and pandemic related staff left when the onset of COVID-19 occurred in the US in March of 2020.  \n>  \n>**Wet markets are breeding grounds for viruses**  \n>  \n>The narrator goes into detail about the 2002 SARS pandemic in China, whose outbreak was accredited to the killing of on-site animals in wet markets. It is noted that the mixing of blood between animals creates \u201cDisease X Factory\u201d due to the contagious nature of zoonotic viruses.Epidemiologists state that SARS in 2002 could have been a \u201cnightmare scenario,\u201d per the episode, however,  it just \u201cwent away\u201d without a serious coordinated response needed.  As the study of COVID-19 reveals the relation between these markets and the spread of the disease, jeopardizing the future of these markets.  \n>  \n>**Intra-country cooperation**  \n>  \n>Following the 2002 SARS outbreak, the World Health Organization \u201cbrought together 196 countries to commit to improve ability to detect, assess, notify and report public health events\u201d as a way to normalize countries working together to fight disease. However, the episode cited that only \u2153 were in compliance with the WHO commitment in 2014. A better assessment of this may have left us more prepared to have a unified response across the world to COVID-19.  \n>  \n>**Focus on the effects of climate change**  \n>  \n>\u201cExplained\u201d emphasized the impact of climate change-related activities on the increased spread of zoonotic viruses. The narrator credits deforestation and factory farming as an additional way for emerging diseases and viruses to spread in the modern world. As their environments are destroyed, animals carrying infectious diseases that would not have previously had contact with humans are pushed into more civilized and urban areas where the disease then spreads.A second theory explored by infectious disease ecologists, including Christina Faust at Penn State University, is that deforestation reduces the spread of disease only between animals and expands it to humans.\u201cIf a bat sneezes in a forest rich with biodiversity, it\u2019s more likely that the pathogens carried in that sneeze land on another animal rather than a human,\u201d Faust said in an NPR article from June.  \n>  \n>**Companies, invest in technology**  \n>  \n>The episode focuses on two main developments in the world of vaccines: Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  and the universal influenza vaccine. The CEPI was reported to be developing a vaccine for \u201cDisease X\u201d in 2019. Their plan was to create injections of genetic material which tell the body to develop protein molecules and antibodies of any virus, thereby cutting vaccine development time to just 16 weeks.We followed up on CEPI and, as of right now, their website states that they have \u201cinitiated nine partnerships to develop vaccines against COVID-19.\u201d Currently, they report to be entering Phase 3 of their clinical trial, so hopefully, they will have succeeded in developing a precursor to the universal \u201cDisease X\u201d vaccine through the vaccine for COVID-19.In addition, the narrator comments on the overall work of epidemiologists around the world in developing a permanent influenza vaccine (which would eliminate the need for a yearly vaccination).  \n>  \n>So maybe \u201cExplained\u201d didn\u2019t exactly predict Coronavirus, but it sure came eerily close. Had we all tuned in 2019, maybe we could have been a little smarter about understanding the progression of this type of disease. Or at the very least, we could have avoided bats at the wet market.",
