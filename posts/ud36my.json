Yeah - Usenet became popular with plex users because it's a worry-free way of using a client and automation to snag your downloads. 5 minutes after a show goes off the air, people usually already have it on their machines and they can do this a bunch of times without worrying about a notice from their ISP.\n\nI've found that my Torrent and Usenet speeds are the same - they're both good at maxing out my bandwidth for whatever's downloading. Usenet is faster for me because my client only allows one-at-a-time (so naturally, it takes all the bandwidth for one download), but Torrenting allows multiple files at once obviously, which sometimes I prefer.",

This add-on basically turns Kodi into a movie streaming service like Netflix. But you need a subscription to Alldebrid to watch the movies. Alldebrid is a service that downloads torrents to their servers so you can download it or stream it from them at your maximum internet speed. You need Alldebrid since torrents aren\u2019t always fast enough to stream. \n\nJust Google \u201chow to install Seren in Kodi\u201d",

                          "text": ">\tIs NAS or seedbox with Plex free?\n\nPlex is just a program, and it\u2019s free. Just go to [plex.tv](plex.tv) and you can download it. If you don\u2019t understand it, then just look on YouTube for videos about Plex. \n\nA NAS or a Seedbox is just a computer that you use to run Plex, but it can be run on any computer you have. It just might be annoying if your computer isn\u2019t always on, and always connected to your home network. \n\n>\thow do I get started?\n\nYou\u2019d have to buy a NAS or convert an old computer into one. NAS just stands for Network Attached Storage, so it basically just means hard drives connected to your internet. \n\nIf you have an old computer or an always on computer, then you can just install Plex for free. However, if you require that computer for other stuff, then I would probably recommend a standalone NAS. I\u2019d probably start with just downloading the software on a computer you already own, so that you can figure out if it\u2019s worth it. \n\nIf you do buy a standalone NAS, I\u2019ve had good luck with ones from a company called Synology (I set up a NAS at my parents and my sisters house, and sync them remotely with software called SyncThing, so that they can watch movies). If you get one, you can just Google YouTube videos about how to set it up as a Plex server, there are a ton out there. \n\nHere\u2019s the cheapest model I\u2019d recommend: [Synology 2-Bay](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0855LMP81/ref=cm_sw_r_awdo_QY4FZ8J7JV1X3C87A75A). It\u2019s cost around $169 new and is what I installed at my sisters house. It works pretty well as long as you don\u2019t need a ton of storage. You can also use it as a Time Machine backup for Mac computers, and can setup a local VPN, which should allow you to get around any type of restrictions that Netflix is planning to implement.\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re really planning to get into it, then I\u2019d recommend on the the 4+ bay (fits 4 or more hard drives) [models](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FT1SFKY/ref=cm_sw_r_awdo_DGZ2EA8FPNHCQ895SATE), since that will allow you setup RAID (which means that all data is copied across multiple hard drives, so that you don\u2019t lose any data if one fails. \n\n**A couple of additional notes:** \n\n-\tNone of the NAS\u2019s I recommend come with hard drives, so you\u2019ll have to buy those separately. It can get expensive, but hard drive prices are getting cheaper and cheaper over time\n-\tA lot of redditors throw out the suggestion to build a Plex server, but it can get pretty expensive (particularly if you actually buy the Blu rays instead of torrenting, like me)  and can be pretty time consuming. I probably wouldn\u2019t do it, except I use it as a means of letting my (diagnosed) OCD run wild and obsess over something relatively safe way\n-\tIf you are gonna start torrenting, then make sure to pay for a VPN. I\u2019ve heard good things about Private Internet Access or Mullvad). If you don\u2019t, you run the risk of getting your internet cut off.",

For all the rest, it went from being a bilateral trade agreement between RUS-USA to being 2 bilateral agreement between USA-SER and SER-RUS.\n\nI suspect some eastern european and central asian countries will see their US imports multiplied by 10 in 2022.

If you own an tractor selling shop in Russia that sells John Deer tractors, you are now going to rotate your stock towards either:\n\n1) Still John Deer, but you'll buy it through a third party at a small premium.\n\n2) Not John Deer anymore. Not any western brand, probably a Chinese brand.\n\nWhat you won't do is close shop because you feel so *sanctioned and guilty* you'd rather starve than go on living.\n\nAnd yes, movie pirating is exactly a statement on the failure of sanctions. It shows you that if you want to prevent people from earning money, they'll just find news ways that don't include you.\n\nNetflix trying to sanction their own people with new rules and ads will have the same effect of increasing piracy. It's not about Russia or being pro-Russian.",
