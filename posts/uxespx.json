An aborted child is clearly different- you can\u2019t really argue the parents intended to do it. But I\u2019ve also heard it argued that maybe the unborn child innately desires salvation, and since they weren\u2019t given a choice, they are saved.\n\nI think the simplest answer is that most choose to believe the baby is saved, since the church doesn\u2019t say otherwise and the alternative is too awful to believe.",

The word virgin comes from a wrong translation to greek.\nMathew 1:23 says this prophecy is the reason Mary got pregnant as a virgin. A prophecy that never states she would be a virgin\nSo there's two options:\n1 Isaiah's original prophecy is correct, so there's no reason for Mary being a virgin. Therefore Matthew is wrong. So the bible is wrong and contradicts itself. We shouldn't believe in the bible. We shouldn't believe in the christian god whose existence main proof is the bible\n2 Mathew is correct, so Isaiah is wrong. The bible is wrong and contradicts itself. We shouldn't believe in the bible. We shouldn't believe in the christian god whose existence main proof is the bible\n3 Both are correct, God ispired the hebrew author of Isaiah to wrote a prophecy that doesnt talk about the Messiah that lead the jews to not believe in Jesus. And he also inspired the translators to make a mistake translating into greek, for the christians centuries after the prophecy was made to believe Jesus was the messiah. So God made the bible contradict itself. God made the bible unreliable. We shouldn't believe in the bible. We shouldn't believe in the christian god whose existence main proof is the bible\n\nThis fact proves the center of Christianitys faith false. It proves the bible to be unreliable. It shows there's no evidence to believe in god",

Think about it, around 30% of the global population is Christian. That means only 1 in 3 people who are born are likely to go to heaven, while 100% of aborted children get to skip all pain and suffering in life and go straight to heaven. Pretty sweet deal.\n\nThere have actually been a number of cases where parents murdered their (already born) children to keep them from sin in the world and guarantee them a spot in heaven. They're largely considered crazy but society, but aren't they just following their religion to it's logical end point?\n\nI remember seeing one apologetics site try to refute/explain this, but all they could really say is that it was ridiculous and unthinkable (like a normal person would say), without really addressing the point.",

It's funny because the reluctance to admit that everything in their religious beliefs obviously leads to this conclusion to me is an indication that they don't truly believe in it themselves.\n\nThe only out is to say either \"it's worth the risk that they _might_ go to hell\" or \"yes, but I don't want to condemn myself to hell.\"\n\nBut put any self sacrificial parent who cares more about their children than themselves, and it's the obvious choice. If Christianity is true, than what happens in this life is _NOTHING_ compared to the literal eternity of the afterlife. It's the equivalent of giving your child a paper cut to guarantee that they never get cancer, except the cancer lasts for all of eternity\n\nAlso if a parent has already \"sacrificed\" their own soul to hell to ensure that their children go to heaven, it is completely logical for them to go around and kill as many children as possible to save more and more of them. Especially the children of other religions/atheists since they are the most likely not to go to heaven should they survive.",

Now that it is better understood that God is not bound by the sacraments and that he can bestow sanctifying grace outside of the sacraments to those who are innocently incapable of receiving it in any other way, there is no need to try to stretch how baptism may be validly conferred. All that is necessary is that parents do all that they can to have their children baptized within the first few weeks after birth (cf. CIC 867 \u00a71; CCC 1261).\n\nIn other words, aborted babies canonically go to heaven. \n\nIn other other words, it is immoral for you *not* to abort, because you're talking a guaranteed ticket to heaven away from the baby. \n\nYeah, religion gets extremely weird when you apply logic to it.",

Instead of classifying into a group like that just read the Bible and learn for yourself.

Scripture does not teach that.\n\nJesus said, \u2018For judgment I have come into this world, so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind.\u2019 Some Pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked, \u2018What? Are we blind too?\u2019 Jesus said, \u2018If you were blind, you would not be guilty of sin; but now that you claim you can see, your guilt remains\u2019\u201d (John 9:39\u201341). In other words, Jesus says, \u201cIf you were truly ignorant [blind], you would have no guilt. It\u2019s because you are not ignorant\u2014you are willfully unbelieving\u2014that you stand guilty before God.\u201d\n\nThe principle Jesus lays down in John 9 is that God does not condemn people for things they are unable to do. Sin is measured by the capacities or ability of people, and by their opportunities of knowing the truth. If people had no ability to do the will of God, they could incur no blame. If they have all proper ability, and no disposition, God holds them to be guilty.\n\nDavid testifies to this thats do says he would be reunited with his dead child after death in 2 Samuel 12:23 - babies go to heaven when they die. The same holds true for those with mental disabilities who cannot comprehend right and wrong. God is looking for every way to reconcile humanity to Himself, so much so He was willing to suffer and die to make that happen. Even then people still reject the truth.",

He is dying next to Jesus, a criminal who admits that he is guilty and worthy of his punishment but recognizes Jesus\u2019 innocence. The Lord tells him \u201ctoday you will be with me in paradise.\u201d He repents, accepts Jesus, and receives salvation through Him. No baptism was required. I\u2019m not downplaying the importance of baptism, I\u2019m simply stating that it is not a requirement of salvation and scripture is clear about this. \u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not works so that no man may boast.\u201d Ephesians 2:8-9.\n\n\u201cThe idea that our maker would choose babies dying and at least possibly going to hell as a means to atone\u201d- The Bible is crystal clear without dispute, there is only one means atonement and that is the self sacrifice of Jesus.

We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away\u201d.\n\nRomans 3:23 \u201cfor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sounds like the you are suggesting that the evil \u201cwe\u201d brought via original sin has resulted in a tragedy that God is either ok with or is incapable of fixing\u201d- I would deny both. God allows evil to happen in the world. Death, murder, rape, oppression, hate\u2026 God hates injustice, full stop. God is also the judge of the world, not the policeman of it. He holds free will to high importance. Only in a world with free will can love even be manifest, you can\u2019t force someone to love you, that\u2019s not love. But with the capacity to love comes the capacity to hate. I have studied the problem of evil extensively and I think there are multiple reasons God allows evil to exist in the world. The first being theodicies, virtuous theodicies for example. The greatest virtues that we know like self sacrifice, forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation can only ever be manifest in the presence of evil. \n\nNow do me the favor and humor me. If God is real we truly are immortal infinite beings that will exist not just consciously forever as disembodied minds, but in physical, resurrected, glorified bodies. In the span of eternity our sufferings in this life, although terrible now from our limited perspective, will be washed completely away by the reunion of the ones we lost and an eternal life without pain and suffering with them and the Lord. If that was the case do you think it would reasonable for God to want us to fully understand what was done for us? What existence without Him is like? If God is real He is Omniperfect by very definition. I think the person of Jesus answers this question for us\u2026is suffering important? It must be as that is the means that God used to redeem us, He wasn\u2019t distant in that. He stepped out of glory and became one of us and died an incredibly violent, horrifying, painful, and shameful death. And He counter it all worthwhile. I trust in His promises, God raised Jesus from the dead and through Him alone are we reconciled.\n\nGod is also capable of fixing it, He is going to, He is a God of His promise and His promise is that all in Christ will be raised on the last day. That He will create a new heaven and a new earth where He will walk with His creation in perfect paradise, just as Eden was intended to be.",

At the moment of conception new DNA is formed, brand new independent DNA. There is no question within the scientific community that an embryo, zygote, fetus are all different levels of development but are still independently human regardless of viability. So call it a clump of cells if it makes it easier to turn a blind eye to the shedding of innocent blood.\n\nYou really misunderstand the Bible. As someone who feels the need to critique God and His word you are completely ill equipped  to do so. Fabric laws are  Old Testament law which no longer applies to Christians. Do you understand the purpose of these laws? Do you think they are just arbitrary to God? That's He's really concerned with the material we wear? I'd urge you to actually do some theological study. Jesus came as a fulfillment of the law to give us freedom to enter into a new covenant with Him.\n\nYour whole argument assumes God is looking for reasons to cast people out of His kingdom, this is simply and demonstrably false. He is doing everything He can to save as many as possible while honoring free will and choice that we have been give. Also, sin does not keep us out of heaven...If that were the case no one would be there. Scripture teaches that it is Jesus death, His penal substitution, that reconciles us with God. His innocence is imputed to us. If your neighbor stole your car and crashed it and you went to court and the judge looked at the criminal that stole your car and said \"it's all good, no worries I forgive you\" that wouldn't be justice, not for you. That would be a corrupt judge. Sin has to be dealt with and since we are inadequate to deal with it since we are corrupted by it, Jesus comes and pays the penalty for all of us. Grace is a free gift that only needs to be received but it absolutely came with a cost.",

Thst being said, I am pro life, the lives of the living and more important than the potential life of those unborn.

The logic of evangelical Christianity for instance dictates that it doesn't matter if you go to hell with one sin on your soul or a thousand, you're still not getting into heaven. So any policy move that would only reduce gun violence is by their black-and-white definition exactly as effective as doing nothing. The same is true for their apparent lack of concern with methods that have been proven to reduce the number of abortions like contraceptives. People are still going to have sinful sex and contraceptives only enable and promote that behavior. \n\nWhat they want to do by making abortion illegal is to **punish** women for getting abortions in the exact same way we already punish the shooters. They don't understand why you would ever want to limit access to guns (\"why punish me for what bad people want to do?\") because we already have consequences for shooting people. In their framework, punishment is the only thing you can do about evil. \n\nOnce the punishment is in place, all that is left for the good people to do about shootings is participate after the fact in the collective commiseration over the ubiquity of evil in the fallen state of man (\"thoughts and prayers\"). Once abortion is outlawed, all that will be left to do is feel smug and self-righteous as loose women die from back-alley abortions and publicly indicate sympathy for the murdered infants while cheering as their wouldbe mothers go to prison.",

Because they've learned that the position they're actually arguing for is indefensible. They want you to argue about whether abortion is murder because it keeps you off the topic of their desire to control women. \n\n\nIf someone says they think something is bad, it's perfectly rational for us to assume that they would see fewer cases of that bad thing as a win. Why on earth would you want let the maximum number possible of bad things happen? **We** know that we can't prevent all crimes, but we also recognize that society is a better place with significantly fewer crimes. \n\nFor them, if one person can get a gun, then it stands to reason that anyone who wants a gun can get one. Nevermind that it's a stastical impossibility for every would-be bad actor to get a gun if there are fewer guns than bad actors. Nevermind that this bares out in literally every country that has implemented it. They genuinely believe that it's literally impossible to meaningfully curb gun violence at all. \n\nSince I'm basically plagerizing this video at this point: [conservatives think about evil the way we think about Mondays.](https://youtu.be/yts2F44RqFw)",

All of the democratic leader ship should be lambasting every single republican with the label they deserve. \n\nBaby killers. They kill babies everyone who votes republicans votes to murder babies. They murder them by making sure my new born daughter cannot receive the formula they need. By not giving them access to healthcare. To have them be forced to be born with horrible disabilities and diseases that cause them to painfully die. Republicans are baby murders. Every single one LOVES to murder babies. They love killing children. Every twitch stream. Every YouTube video. Every ESPN commercial. Every tnt broadcast. Every Netflix Hulu commercial should be an ad of all the names of 192 house republicans who voted for babies to starve. It should list the atrocities they voted for. They need to be shamed. \n\nPeople like Desantis who are actively trying to keep republicans uninformed and not shamed are true scum and they need to be labeled as such. Any democrat who has any fucking spine should spend their entire time not being PC but as loud as they can labeling these evil fucks as the mass murdering baby killers they are. \n\nThey keep us all in position where we have to work 50+ hours a week just so our kids can survive. So we don\u2019t have the time or freedom to take to the streets. The worst part about this is so many of us who just want peace and equality also don\u2019t vote because they have been trained their vote doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nI hate that I\u2019ve taken to commenting on political issues on Reddit. I just want my kids to grow up and be able to grow old. But at this point climate change alone may kill us all before our kids have the chance to grow old.\n\nEdit: Also the fact that this country was founded on the idea of freedom of religion. That we have the right to believe in any religion. Not Christianity.  Our country has become The Christian taliban. It\u2019s fucking disgusting. Yet we are stuck with our shit two party system of one side that doesn\u2019t stand up for us. Then the other party that are baby murdering fundaments.",

If you don't have faith in our father why does it bother you so much that others do? Ik of a lot of atheists who believe in spirits or aliens and whatnot. So why is believing in God such a bad thing or so ridiculous? I wasn't raised religious at all I actually never believed in God until about a year ago when I started reading the Bible because of my friend and although some of the stories seem far fetched there's so much good and truth to take away from it. Also artifacts have been found from stories in the Bible, scientifically tested, and proven that they are from the same time frame. You seem like a very bitter, unhappy person. Having faith could turn that around for you. Wish you the best. God bless\ud83d\ude4f",

Omnibenevolence would imply the deity wants to intervene for the supposed good of their subjects. And the omnipotence means they always know when something is going against their will. So, yeah, in this case, omnipotence does mean pretty much everything is according to the deity's will, if only by their allowing it to happen without intervening.",

Any rational person can see that there needs to be a change in policy concerning gun laws here. The majority of those people will not have any idea of an effective solution, and they shouldn't need to. Of course people will lash out when they are asked to do something that should not be their job in the first place, depending on how you engage with them.

There are many resources from knowledgeable people that you could find within seconds which would answer your question.

It's people who care more about their weapons than the most vulnerable people in this country.\n\nIt isn't necessary to know the difference between a clip and a magazine or how 'assault rifle' is meaningless, or that AR means ArmaLite, or some other trivia, to clearly see that there is a serious problem. There are only a few things a person really needs to know in order to understand that policy needs to change. The fact that overall violence is down from decades ago is immaterial in the face of this phenomenon. \n\nThis is the ONLY developed nation where this happens regularly, and it has only really become common in the last 2 decades. That, along with knowing that firearms are highly concentrated here and easily attainable is enough to see that policy change is necessary. Why would someone be more afraid of losing their gun than having their children be murdered? A conceal-carry won't help you, if your opponent has effective body armor as happened a week or two ago. The fact that most gun deaths are suicides is even more reason to increase background checks and restrict purchases.",

The more devoted someone is the more likely they are to believe this to be true and the more likely they are to believe themselves to qualify for this reward, while also being more willing to override their fear of death for the sake of their religion.\n\nHowever, the more devoted someone is to the religion the more useful they are to the religious leaders, as they'll be less inclined to question the leaders and more willing to prioritize the needs of the religion and its leaders over their own. So religious leaders don't actually want the most devoted followers to kill themselves because that's a waste.\n\nEnd result, religious leaders forbid suicide while at the same time promoting the reward after death to keep their devoted followers obedient without having them take a shortcut to their reward.",

If you look at what really matters to people control over their own life ranks pretty highly.\n\nI believe this is also why people are so easily pulled in by religion in the first place: the Abrahamic religions tell you that everything is according to the will of a divine power, and that said power will reward those who are faithful and obedient. It creates the illusion that they can control their fate through prayer and supplication. If something bad happens to them it's not because they're just unlucky (which means there's no control), it's that they're being tested or that they didn't show enough devotion/obedience (which means they do have control, but they need to try harder).\n\nYou can also look at how these people tend to oppose social welfare and support public figures who claim that anyone can make it if they just try hard enough and that all these poor people relying on social welfare only have themselves to blame. Because if this were true it would mean everyone has control over their own fate. The reality, where you can try as hard as you want and never get anywhere because you're unlucky, is one which makes people feel helpless and like they don't have any control at all.\n\nThat, and from a biological perspective, there's a very strong selective pressure for self-preservation. Strong devotion can override that, but combined with the control thing it's entirely possible for someone to be fully willing to die on their own terms but to be deadly afraid of being killed by someone they perceive as an enemy. Is it rational? No. Are humans rational? To a greater or lesser extent, but for the most part not.",

Far and away the vast majority of our elected officials are Christian but we don't see any legislation in any geared towards addressing the neverending housing crises, require the minimum wage to provide a life worth living, provide universal healthcare, or address the rampant viciousness of our culture.\n\nFrom these Christian Politicians we see approval of constant manufacturing of wars or new opportunities to sell weapons, an abject refusal to address the looming climate crisis we have caused, policies of looting undeveloped nations, encouragement of seeking a profit in all things at the cost of all other possible considerations, and constant intrusion of Christianity into the State to name a very, very few.\n\nYou don't have 'common sense'.  You've been indoctrinated into the most destructive cultural force in the history of humanity and can't be bothered to see it.",

Sure he probably thought it'd be comforting to people. It just makes him sound like an idiot with no knowledge of the truth or God's word. Here's a good idea..... Sprinkle a little religious line in the condolences for the families. NOT!  Honestly...... He should probably be \"Will Smithed\" real hard!  Okay, okay.....  not very Christian like \ud83e\udd37 well... nobody's perfect ;) That said.....\n\nGod doesn't kill children or make people get sick with cancer etc. as some sort of punishment. Why is it so hard for people to understand that it's Satan (devil, demonic spirits) who comes to kill, steal and destroy us! How..... By Attacking our minds, body, families, finances and ultimately our souls. With the sole purpose of separating us from the love/word of God. Whose sole purpose is to bless/save those who freely choose to believe and have faith in Jesus. John 3:16 is for real y'all! \n\nSo I realize this group/forum:\nDon't believe in God right.... But have you ever.... Asked him to reveal himself to you? Start speaking there's power in the name of Jesus to break every chain \u26d3\ufe0f and feel the atmosphere change! JS don't knock it till you try it. \n\nLastly....  Kudos to Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick for speaking the truth today...... Get back to our roots!\n\n\"Choose you this day whom you will serve.....

Same exclusive club.\r  \n\r  \nActually, violence itself is an overwhelmingly male phenomenon. The percentage of people in prison for violence is overwhelmingly male.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, sexual deviancy \u2026 specifically the act of engaging in sex with children - of all ages including under the age of 10 \u2026 is predominantly a male mental defect. Well over 90% of sexual abuse of little girls is by men. Men are also responsible for 2/3rds of the sexual abuse of little boys.\r  \n\r  \nSo, while statistics from other countries establish beyond any doubt that controlling guns reduces these shooting incidents to almost zero (and explains why this the USA is the only country in the world with the issue)... the bigger picture says it really isn't an issue about guns. Women own guns but we don't see female mass shooters. They are all fucking MALES.\r  \n\r  \nSo, let's please start talking about addressing the actual problem. And - btw - as proof of the problem, it has been my experience that males do nothing but object to the undeniable facts - instead of deciding to be part of the solution by supporting efforts to determine WHY this problem is exclusive to males.",

I found it interesting that the study attempted to remove the idea of being judged from the outcome by taking steps to keep each set of subjects anonymous from each other. Curious in that regard, I downloaded and read the pdf relating to procedures. I found my lack of education with statistics and overall jargon relating to conducting studies made it difficult to be comfortable I was actually correctly discerning the extent of - or lack of - true anonymity. \n\nFrom the best I could determine, there was no anonymity between the 'decider' and the testers. And if that conclusion is accurate, I can't see how that wouldn't be a major flaw since the 'deciders' behavior would still be impacted by the fear of being judged.\n\nThat also made me think about your original post which, if I recall, made you interested in a test in which there was pure anonymity - hitting a button to deliver pain without any ability to be judged. Am I correctly seeing a correlation between this study and your post? ;)\n\nbtw: I'm 69 and now feeling pretty good about myself - eg accuracy of my memory of the Milgram Shock Experiment which I learned in one of my college pysch classes back in 1970-74 (and to the best of my knowledge I never read about again).... so thanks for that! ... hahah",

The same way Republicans pushed forward on banning abortion:\n\n* Constant, relentless messaging\n* Making gun control a central feature in Democratic campaigns\n* Gerrymandering districts to limit conservative influence\n* Laws which allow private citizens to sue anybody involved in the manufacture, distribution, or sale of a gun that ends up being used in a crime (similar to the Texas law which allows anybody to sue those who help a woman get an abortion)\n\nOn top of all this, it's critical that Democrats show open contempt for anybody who claims that gun control is useless. These pro-death arguments should not be met with logical counterpoints. They should be met with derisive laughter and insults. It's time to fight fire with fire.",

Humans are irredeemable, and it is only because their deity has a soft spot for his creation that there is even any hope for such putrid beings.\n\nChristianity is also an apocalyptic end-times cult. The best thing they can hope to happen is for god to usher in the complete destruction of our planet, and the final sorting of all humans into either the positive or negative eternal afterlife. They thus actively work toward contriving that apocalypse.\n\nAn anti-human apocalyptic death cult is who is trying to take over this country, so it is no wonder they fail to care about anything normal humans care for.",

I\u2019d argue all moral questions can be answered with ethical reasoning. In many cases, this will lead to a similar outcome as following a predefined set of rules like you find in the bible (Jesus had many humanist ideals). The difference is that you understand your decision making rather than blindly following something. This is important especially when these rules make no sense. For example, most religious people hate/dislike other religions or gay people\u2026 But there is no ethical reason to be against other beliefs or homosexuality.",

There is no proof he ever existed and an overwhelming amount of proof that says the bible (and by extension god, since he helped write it) is actually fake filled with innacuracies and contradictions.  Please stop with the whole prayer thing.  You know full well that he isn't real.  You're clinging to fear of nothingness in the afterlife.  god is weak, vengeful, and impotent and he hides behind free will, conveniently ignoring that our free will is to have no evil Angel running around",

Most religious people think it starts pretty early, and the arguments against it don't really convince me. I should be clear, 100% non religious, never went to church, never raised with religion, never voted right wing. Gay marriage is a lot fuzzier to me, but I think the general argument comes down to the rights afforded by marriage and weather or not those should be applied to people who can't have kids. I think it's a dumb thing to restrict, but i think theirs an argument there, even if I don't agree with it. Again, if it's discrimination or not depends on a few things, but I don't think it has to be discrimination or hatred to hold those opinions for those reasons.",

Thankfully or unthankfully depending on how you look at it, plenty of people are unable to raise a kid, or die before they can, so those couples that can't have kids can take the kid if they want and still bring that child up in a home with a man and a woman so the kid gets strong imprints from both sex. An infertile straight couple isn't the same as a gay couple. But personally I don't think it's enough to keep gay people from getting married. But again, I think theirs an argument to be made there, and probably made a lot more fully and cleanly by someone who actually holds these beliefs.",

Because we listen to eachother, enjoy eachother, and occasionally talk politics. Let me be as clear as possible. I think it's funny you're selling yourself online at 30 because you should have your shit together more than that. Not because it's bad, but because you, with all the stupid you showed me you are in this conversation, can't even take care of yourself. That's fucking hilarious. Of course you can't, look how offended you were by the questions you asked me to answer. It fit together like a puzzle, piece. And was very funny to me. You can keep thinking I'm a homophobic religious zealot, but that's why you really don't connect with people. You are too ready to be offended.",

If only an \"omnipotent\" god could have found a way to *not* leave their wishes/rules/needs subject to such things as translation or the errors and faults of men (who he, supposedly, created and trusted with this task.)\n\n>This sub, and yes the degenerates in here\n\nThat's unnecessarily rude and inaccurate. Don't be that person.\n\n>turning Atheism into religious cult itself, which makes it no different than every other religion\n\nBullshit.

And school shootings....none. \nAs for your idea of security guards...first off a guy getting paid minimum wage isn't gonna take a bullet when a cop that's trained to do shit will not either.  Secondly if every school had an armed security guard, he would be the first to be targeted and then you're back to square one.  I'm a gun owner, but it's ppl like you that give us a bad name.  What's it to you if you need to register your guns.  You'll still have them, you just gotta go through a background check first.",
