And Pollution per capita shows how good Western nations are at hiding their pollution levels owning to their tiny pollution. As I said before, let the winters come, we'll see how Europe fires up the coal plants and then Asians will pressurise Europe to bloody transition to clean energy. Because Russia will kill gas supplies which will turn Europe into a popsicle.",

Btw, u can't hide ur pollution because the production of plastics and chemicals causing pollution is well monitored all over the world and can be easily determined by calculating the amount of chemicals and crude oil a nation imports. But ofcourse, ur pea brain still would think that filthy US is the only one who shows true numbers. Nice excuse for being the top polluter, but only for retards.",

The sex ratio in India fell from 940 females for 1,000 males in 2011 to 900 females to 1,000 males in 2015, mostly due to illegal sex-selective abortions.\u201d\n\nWhatever you feel about this poet\u2019s work, this isn\u2019t a literal statement from her.
