The ex and I hang out whenever practical but she's in med school states away now. Us four had a good start to the weekend, margaritas then a trip to the casino. We won a decent amount and split it between the four of us, and celebrated before going back to the hotel. \n\n We got back, 3 of us were pretty intoxicated and the one was holding back for a sporting event the next day and those three hop in th3 shower. They invite me in and in my drunken state I say \"it's too crowded in there, im gonna explore. Brb\" and I take my onewheel (electeic skareboard) into a foreign city to me, cruising around till I hit a dip in the road and eat it at 20 mph. \n\nI broke my ankle in three spots, went to the hospital and had my parents pick me up from three hours away, And when the ladies call to check on me the next day, they had me check their snap story where they met Mark Cuban at the rugby game. \n\nTL:DR by turning down 3 ladies in a shower only to severely injure myself and miss out on a chance to meet a billionaire. Damn.",

His lips feel dry, and he coughes instead of being able to speak up. His grandson looks down at his frail, weak and pale body and is aware that death will not wait much longer. \"Don't be afraid,\" the grandson says meekly. \"I guess the rest of the family will join you before long, this planet has gone to hell...\" he laments thoughtfully. \"There's so much I still wanted to do. Well, one thing anyway... I'm an idiot for even thinking about it,\" the grandson explains, \"but a threesome would have been amazing to experience at least once in my life. Every guy wants to experience that at least once, right?\"\n\nOP cringes, then dies quietly. Far away in the background you can hear the wind outside the cave picking up, and the sound of a one-wheel can be heard fading away into the distance.",

But I was busy and ended up accidentally leaving her on read as the kids say now and forgot about it until just this moment all these year later - and searching her up now I can\u2019t find her.

I said no, everything is fine. \"Are you sure?\", she asked. \"I'm sure, I said. \"Isn't there anything I can do for you?\" she wanted to know. \"I reckon not\" I replied ...\"  \n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the doctor, \"What does this story have to do with your leg?\"   \n\n\"Well, this morning, \" the farmhand explained, \"when it dawned on me what she meant, I fell off the roof!\"",

It does exist but good luck finding that.",

At this point, people use sigma to hype up themselves if they are social outcast smellies, and everyone else uses it purely to make fun of those people ironically and make fun of people using the term at all, at best, and even that\u2019d out of vogue",

Not the slightest scratch. I told this to the EMTs and said I don't need medical attention, I'm not getting in that ambulance. \n\nThey tried SO HARD to get me in there, and eventually DID but only because they claimed they wanted me to sign a document to \"waive medical attention\" and they would go away. In hindsight I'm not sure why I didn't ask to sign it outside of the ambulance, I was stressed out in the moment and only had myself to guide me.\n\n3 days later I get a bill in the mail for $350 from the local EMS for them coming out that night. I went straight to a lawyer (friend from HS) and wrote a colorful response, threatening legal action. The bill got thrown out. \n\nThey didn't even let me know that it was thrown out. Several months later I was at a family/friend outing, and someone there happened to work for the EMS. I had a friendly discussion with him about it. He immediately recognized what I was talking about, and said \"oh yeah don't worry about that.\"\n\nOur system is fucked.",

No one is going to assume that man\u2019s dick is going to perform a certain way or not, because there really is no way to know.  What matters the most is that they are down and excited to be involved, using toys, fingers, mouth, etc.\n\n2.  Look, I don\u2019t know how old you are, but we\u2019re not all 19 year-olds.  Most adult men aren\u2019t out there coming 4 times in a row.  The fact that you seem to think that it\u2019s common shit to go an hour per a person, therefore in this scenario THREE HOURS and three loads, just makes me think that you\u2019re the one who hasn\u2019t had a threesome.\n\n3.  They know he\u2019s drunk.  Drinking effects a dick.  That\u2019s common knowledge.\n\n4.  I am a woman who does not have a penis.  I feel like my lil avatar person makes that pretty obvious.

She ended up living something like 100 meters next to us, thanks to a friend of a friend that had a spare room to rent.\n\nThis happened something like 2/3 month before the dinner , and I still had a gf so I wasn't even thinking about any way to connect with this girl nor I was interested (A model, living just some month in Milan).\n\nI wasn't in a relationship anymore by the day the dinner took place, I was really ok about my relationship being over, so no \"need some time for myself\" reason.\n\nI know that 99% she was simply kind to invite me, and I've never been a club guy; I knew the club she was headed to be the typical Milan trash/vip/fashion kind of club, but yet maybe I could have get some less demoman kills on pl\\_goldrush for one night and experience this rich - full of international fashion models night with free champagne and a driver to bring me to the club and back home.\n\nIt was just some pure, authentic, nerdy: \"no thanks it's late\" to then spend the night playing something like Team Fortress 2 till 2 AM",

Who's to say he didn't save himself from getting an STD or having to deal with a kid from it?

The thing is, if the girls are not into each other, the sex becomes really awkward, because they have to wait in turns for my attention and the currently passive partner starts easily feel like a third-wheel. For me, I start to concern too much about sharing enough attention to both of the women, so they don't bore out or get jealous. I think a proper threesome needs certain level of confidence from each of the member, so performance anxiety won't kick in. Otherwise it's like a sex on a beach or in a shower: sounds hot in your mind, but reality is cold and frustrating",

After I cum, it goes more complicated: now you are satisfied and need time to reload, but there's two unsatisfied chicks, who want your attention, so now you have to take turns with each of them and constantly remember to swap, so the other one won't feel as an outsider. Of course there's this whole level of \"there needs to be communication and trust in order to have a good sex\", but honestly not many guys and gals in their 20s have enough experience to execute that smoothly. \nSo yeah, in the end, there were three people lying on bed wondering \" was that it? I thought it would've been better\". Of course we would have made it better by practicing but there was no other chance for another threesome time. Trust me, it doesn't work like in a porn realm.",

I smoked a lot in my home country  before heading to the states, but I\u2019ve been sober for like 6 months before that because I was scared that they would do drug tests at American schools and send me back home right away again. Anyway, we chill in her room, she loads her pipe and we both smoke a pure bowl. She would pack another one for herself right after that, asking me if I\u2019d like a second one too, but I\u2019m already stoned out of my mind. So we were laying in her bed, she lies next to me on her side, facing me, presenting her body to me (I only realized that afterwards). I\u2019m so wasted I couldn\u2019t even say anything anymore. Was listening to the sound of a dog barking that I could hear due to an open window, wondering \u201eDamn, what\u2019s that sound?\u201d. To this day, I want to beat myself into the hospital for that. So you\u2019re not alone brother",

It's being sad that while dating someone my thoughts will be: we'll probably just settled with me because would fuck anything anyways. \nAnd I know it's not true for all men thank God, but this generalization does not come from nothing. \nToo much men makes it known here that the only thing needed is literally just a vagina and that's it.\nAlso these \"I would give my liver willingly to have a 4some with women\" lol.\nPathetic. \nAnd again, I am not saying I would definitely turn down a 4some with 3 handsome men, but it would be just like \"well what an opportunity should get the dicks asap\".\nI think you are being on a low horse.",

I recommend having a sense of humor about it. This story will kill at parties.\n\nSince the whole thread is ragging on you, look at it this way. In an alternate universe you took the shower and had a great time. In a different alternate universe, you slipped on soap getting in the shower and broke your ankle. \n\nGoing deeper, a lot of drunken hookups are not that great (clearly you\u2019ve seen TIFU). It may sound silly, but I\u2019ve had spur of the moment hookups like this that made things very awkward much later for reasons that weren\u2019t foreseeable. Especially with your ex being in the equation, never underestimate how awkward things can get. \n\nI\u2019m a cyclist, so I actually understand the impulse to go exploring in that situation. I\u2019ve turned down potential hookups to go night riding because sometimes hitting that flow state under city lights is just unbeatable. \n\nGood luck with rehab!",

Anyways, they both run for the nice shower and hop in together. The bathroom is attached to my bedroom so I kinda bellow out an \u201cargh\u201d and stomp my feet. One of them yells out \u201cyou can come shower with us too\u201d. \n\nI freeze - I\u2019m pretty drunk and of course it\u2019s the roommate that I have a bit of a crush on that said it, so the descent into a self conscious hole is major. All of the possibilities are running through my head and it doesn\u2019t help that the other roommate\u2019s boyfriend is coming over any minute. \n\nSo what do I do? Well, I hop on my bike and ride down the street to the gas station and pick up some blunt wraps. Come home and they\u2019re out of the shower, roommate\u2019s boyfriend is there. We all go downstairs and smoke a blunt and watch tv and I sit there wondering to myself what could have happened.",

      "text": "When I was in college I was hanging out with this cute girl who was red flag city.  It should be stated that she had recently broken up with one of my best friends. And she had told him she was pregnant, and let him freak out about it for a good 24 hours before she revealed it was just a joke. She just wanted to see how he'd react. And there the relationship ended.   \nAbout a month or two later, she had a party. I end up over there sorta by happenstance, and she takes me into her room on the \"house tour.\" It is dark in there and there was a girl having sex in her bed with a guy. And she goes, hey JComposer84 this is my friend Maria, she's visiting from France.   \n\n\nAnd Maria responds \"Hey! Nice to meet you!\"\n\nI'm kinda like ok that was not something I'd experienced before but she's French so maybe it's normal over there. .  \n\n\nAnyway the night goes on and I get drunk and I end up doing some of the devil's dandruff and I decide to run home like 5 miles away. I finally get home and I turn on the computer and I have AIM msgs from this girl, asking where I disappeared to?   \n\n\nShe says her and her friend want to have a threesome with me. I respond something to the effect of \"haha or yeah right\" and she goes \"JComposer84, you are drunk. And I am serious.\"  \n\n\nBy now it's 4:30 am and I'm a broke college student so the only way I'm getting over there is by walking. And I am so certain that by the time I get there they will be passed out and over it. I'm also factoring in the \"pregnant joke\" in this decision.   \nOh I had also begun a new relationship. I always forget about that detail.   \nSo anyway I reluctantly pass and that's the end of the story.   \n\n\nBut it's about 15 years later and I still kick myself in the ass. So there you go op. The moral of the story is you'll be kicking yourself in the ass until the day you die! :)",

Lol.\n\n\nBut on a serious note that sucks. And hope your ankle has healed to get you back to 100%  and if it gives you any issues, or to prevent issues, it would be a good idea to workout, both lifting weights for strength and endurance, and keep stretching.  So that you can build up more muscle in the surrounding area, and get more flexible and more ligament and tendon strength so that the muscle amd soft tissue can take some of the stress off of the joint itself.",

For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted. But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth. He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he stricken. And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth. Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.\n\nThis was written 800 years before Jesus died for our sins on the cross.  Study the scripture and pray for revelation and you will get it.  No one who humbles themselves before God and asks for wisdom will be denied by Him\n\nJeremiah 29:13 KJV \u2014 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.",
