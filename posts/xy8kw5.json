There is one where humanoid bears live in. Recently, a great evil has emerged on that dimension which affects all the dimensions.\n\nKanye can see the Bear dimension and using his knowledge of both dimensions, he can affect events in the Bear dimension that will affect the war, which ultimately effect us.\n\nEvents that happen in one dimension affect the other. With this knowledge, Kanye is able to help the underdog good guys. Remember when Kanye interrupted Taylor Swift? If he didn't do that, half of Canada would have been destroyed.\n\nRemember this? https://v.redd.it/2qzojvgz8hw71 Kanye was preventing a head of state from being kidnapped, and he did it while still entertaining his fans.\n\nKanye the day he ran for president. If he had won he could have ended the war for good. You can see the toll the bear war was taking on him\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/wwiepzk4zcu71.jpg",
