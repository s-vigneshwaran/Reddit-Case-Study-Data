It was a rhetorical point I made because this bill would have banned all abortion with no exception for rape, incest, child abuse, or the life of the mother.  The way the bill was poorly worded would have also made in-vitro fertilization, plan B, ending a deadly ectopic pregnancy, and IUDs and other long-form contraception illegal. My point was that under this bill, if a child became pregnant--which can happen to very young girls who experience assault--they would be forced in Nebraska to give birth. Unclench!",

Few abortions (7.0%) were performed at 14\u201320 weeks' gestation, and even fewer (1.3%) were performed at \u226521 weeks' gestation.\" ([Source: CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6108a1.htm))\n\nApproximately *all* of these late term abortions are due to problems with the pregnancy or the fetus that cannot be tested for or discovered until later in pregnancy, many of which threaten the mother's health and/or indicate that the fetus is already non-viable. \n\nThe myth of the pregnant woman who waits until half an hour before her delivery date, then grinds her healthy fetus into salsa con carne for funsies, is just that: a MYTH.  It's nonsensical [Blood Libel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_libel), in the same category as the mythical Jewish Vampires who make pancakes with the blood of christian children, or the mythical Satanic Daycare Workers who use the magic of Dungeons & Dragons to summon real demons, or the mythical Vaccines That Cause Autism. Outside the overactive imaginations of bigoted propagandists, these things essentially **do not exist**. And if you pretend that they **do** exist, the only thing you're accomplishing is spreading hateful propaganda. \n\nPlease educate yourself, and stop doing that.",

What I don't understand, as a foreigner, is why American politicians who cares always start by saying, just like their co-workers across the aisle, that 'we live in the best country in the world'.

Tell me again, what are the factors that make the United States 'the greatest country in the world'. Why would make a lower middle class happy to live in the US today, instead of say, Denmark, France or Canada?",

The Gen Z generation is already the least religious out of all the generations thus far, but they can also see the bullshit of what Republicans are pulling & what Republicans are currently doing isn't working on trying to reel them in.\n\nAll that Republicans & the religious right are going to do, is further embolden the new Atheist movement in which even **more** sane people will leave religion & start revolting against them. A lot of folks are already pissed about their Republican Governors in states like Florida, Texas & Oklahoma in which they're messing with women's abortion rights.

As I said, people work better as cooperating individuals. We are NOT a collective, and groupthink does bad things to us. We are not, and should not, be \"brothers.\" We're neighbors. Courtesy, not solidarity.\n\nAnd I don't think leaders *should* necessarily have \"the collective\" in mind when they lead. They are attempting to accomplish a purpose. If your goal is to reduce the cost of space flight (SpaceX) to make it routine, your employees should be secondary to that goal. The primary purpose is the goal, not providing the best possible careers to your employees. You'll have to pay them well to keep the best ones anyway, free markets work, and work well.",

Religious fundamentalism is its own independent cancer destroying the country. Reducing it down to only some charade of the rich to sow discord vastly downplays the danger they pose. The rich just wanted money, we are in a boring dystopia with the rich in control. Yes it sucks, but a religious theocracy would be an order of magnitudes worse. And the scary part is there is a huge mob of crazy who truly want that to be our world, and they are trying to make it happen, they aren't hiding it.",

The reason they did not try to do it is because religions we currently look at as one religion were a lot more fregmented. That fragmentation lead to suspicion, and they were afraid that them legislating their own religion would lead to others with \"different\" religion to legislate it on them. Since then the devisive issues in most major religion in the US have eroded away, or became obselete from the 'culture war' (or technological development). Many large groups now ignore others or believe that they would stand with them on given issues they are trying to legislate.",

When the egg doesn\u2019t implant for whatever reason, that\u2019s how it gets disposed of, after all. And her opinion piece was about how she assumed some percentage of the anti-abortion crowd was working on this\u2026then discovered that literally no one was worrying about all the potential lives that weren\u2019t able to implant. It was like the lever that got the wheel out of the rut. She couldn\u2019t justify none of her compatriots caring about this issue if their argument that it was about saving the unborn was in good faith. It was an unusual idea to have gotten stuck on imo, but interesting that THIS was the point that got through to her, that THIS was what proved to her that it wasn\u2019t about babies, it was about control.",

But that\u2019s what we need to convince the anti abortionists of. If you have the genuine conviction that abortion is murder, it\u2019s perfectly ethically justifiable to force women to carry rape babies. So calling them evil pricks won\u2019t change their minds.\n\nThe only way to win such an argument is to convince them that a fetus does not have a soul, and/or does not have personhood/sentience. Or that the soul of a fetus, if it exists, is not necessarily worth preserving in its earthly form.\n\nIf you don\u2019t care about convincing them, there\u2019s no need for your reply.

She went on about how she's a born again Christian who didn't use to believe. And on and on. \n\n*Forty minutes later*\n\nI found out she's had 2 abortions. \n\nThis was AFTER she had told me she witnessed a still birth from a friend, and \"it was because of the covid vaccine.\"\n\nI had to stop her right there--I had not pushed too hard, listened and had semi-amusing dialogue til that line. I pushed her hard on that, \"Woah, when you make a claim like that you have to prove it. Still births have many causes, you can't just say the vaccine did it, it could have been something else.\"\n\nAnd all she said was, \"Well, there's the proof.\"\n\nRight...\n\nEDIT: This story brought to you by the fact that she said our generation (assuming Millenials), were too keen on abortion and going against god for killing babies.",

But because an abortion is happening behind closed doors, they feel that all they have to do is stand there and scream at women.  \n\nThey don't truly believe it's murder.  If they did, they would do something.  But doing something is hard, and it involves actual sacrifice.  They aren't willing to do that.",

The fetus wins for them pretty much every time (in any case except imminent death of the mother), because the right to life trumps pretty much everything. \n\nThe best analogy I have seen to handle this is medical donations. The hypothetical: say someone is dying, and they need a blood transfusion immediately. You are the only person available with a matching blood type. The person will 100% guaranteed recover if you donate some of your blood, which will not harm you at all, but they will 100% die if you don't. You still can't be forced to donate your blood against your will, even though it would cost you nothing. The argument, then, is that you shouldn't be able to force a mother to donate her body to incubating a fetus, even if it would cost her nothing (ignoring, of course, that carrying out a pregnancy is a huge cost).\n\nThis still breaks down under their value system, though. For any case where the mother chose to have sex (that is, any case except rape), they'll just say it's different because she made a choice that resulted in the fetus needing her body, so she has an obligation.",

The problem comes when they jump to some other assumptions (tbf easy to do if you don't know better)\n\n\n1 That abortions are killing babies(generally not understanding that most abortions occur long before viability of the fetus)\n\n\n2 Through media aimed at them, they think there's a lot of late term abortions  (not true, and those are almost always medical decisions or ones that are not just 'hey I better get rid of this baby do I can just go have more sex to have more abortions) these are hard decisions and need to be decided between doctors and the person who is pregnant.\n\n\n3 Not understanding body autonomy or thinking that the fetus ('baby') has MORE rights as its rights force a woman to give birth. No one, not even a fetus, has the right to any part of your body against your will. The baby, on e born, can't demand anything from the mothers body (even a blood transfusion) if the mother is unwilling. A woman's body is her choice (it really should just stop there, but I'm hoping the rest of this post helps make it clear why it's not that way for many)\n\n4 That people need to be responsible for their actions, and pregnancy is risk for having sex, and that's on the people having sex, and abortion is murder. This may be a strawman, but I believe a lot of conservative pro life believe that the the abortion is murder, and that the morality ends there, but I think.there is a much larger moral issue. I think as a society we can do better.\n\n - this is trickier to unpack and address, but here's a highlevel:\n\n*People are going to have sex, you just can't stop it. It's a drive so basic, it's why we are all here. \n\n\n*No birth control is 100 percent effective. \n\n\n*Suffering and impact to society and that potential human life is important. An unwanted and uncared for child is more of a ethical concern than terminating a pregnancy as  it may cause a chain of suffering and crime rates, poverty have seen correlated improvement when woman has access to abortion.\n\n\nI'm trying to address secular, good faith (ironic) arguments here only.",

Most abortions occur before most would call it personhood. I would tend to say where that line is and how much you value potential and investment is arguable.\n\n\n I'm very much more about reducing unnecessary suffering more than protecting every life (human or non human) and I think there are good and bad for both approaches and you cannot avoid either. I don't see much distinction between humans and most animals in suffering (I'm not vegan or vegetarian) but support humane treatment of both. I don't consider abortion less moral than raising a pig for slaughter and killing it. Pigs have a very high level of intelligence and perception, exceeding dogs. That being said I understand species bias being engrained as well as other biases based on other aspects , dogs are essentially infantilized wolves (we are typically more disturbed by deaths of dogs in movies than people )\n\n\n2. I think I agree here :) edit: I missed the last sentence but I addressed it further down. \n\n3. Not sure I understand this position. \nIf you are DUI you are impacting the life and well being of others. They aren't asking you to not drink, just not endanger others? To me what you do to yourself is open unless it harms others. This is not the same as requiring you to ensure another doesn't die, like the president of your country needs a transplant and only you have a compatible organ\n The procedure is not likely to be fatal, but you can't be forced to be a donor. This can get very complicated as it needs to be considered in the context of a lot of things and probably lead to a very uncomfortable discussion of what we value and why. That's why I try to use reduction of unnecessary suffering as a measurement and avoid simply death. It may seem horrific but if there was no suffering (to the person or anyone else) I would not oppose most deaths, but that's nearly impossible as we have a deep emotional connection to life and the lives of others. \n\n4. I do think this probably the most viable option to effectively reduce unwanted  pregnancies and abortions. I don't think anyone who is mentally stable  wants to go through an abortion, and the data supports that early and accurate sex education and easy access to birth control works(and abstinence only backfires with higher STDs and unwanted pregnancies). I just don't think female reproduction should be a matter for me or others to decide. It should be between a medical professional and ultimately the choice of the person involved. I think trusting medical professionals, educating women (and everyone) on the data will give us our best bet in reaching the best outcomes.\n\nAgain many thanks for your response!",

Respectfully I do not seek to change your views, and while I don't think my beliefs are deeply held as I see the uni worse and myself as a constantly changing systems of states and influences. \n\nI'm ignostic (not agnostic) but from what I know and experienced  of the affects of different states of brain(chemical) it would not surprise me entirely to find some state deemphasizes rational thought and emphasizes experiential or emotional states and therefore. Subject to things \"I might not believe or do if I had all my wits about me\". Roughly equating that to an inebriated  brain.\n\nSo...\n\nI absolutely agree on deeply held belief and and that humans are not rational first. \nI think rationality probably evolved to allow us to get  or avoid things we wanted or didn't want and get us out of trouble that our emotionally motivated actions may get us into :)\n\nBasically the cognitive brain is the pimp and the apologist :)\n\nThe spectrum of personhood is indeed really tricky and I don't see life really ending or beginning (not in a metaphysical way) that who we are as persons in a gradual emergent thing and that thing is what identifies itself as a person, but is a moving spectrum with many real and debatly  illusionary parts, and the sense of continuity in that emergence. \n\nI personally don't think the test of personhood fits a fetus, and many of the things people might attribute to personhood word fit many animals far better other than the fact we are species prejudiced. I don't think potential personhood is personhood, but I can absolutely understand the feeling that is or why people value it. \n\nI think in the modern first world a lot of people are fairly removed from how nature behaves and balances itself.  Usually starvation (extreme suffering) maximizing life, essentially unchecked growth usually has a high suffering cost. Especially if you introduce it into a system that faces resource struggles. \n\nOne can certainly argue that a lot of human suffering due to resource struggles are arbitrary, or matters of distribution, greed etc.\n\nHumans unlike other animals have the ability to do analysis and try to humanely adjust population and resources.  I certainly find any abortion more moral than starvation but that's a simplistic example. \n\nWhile I respect people and try to.understabd them and often it is deeply held beliefs or just deeply ingrained behavior, I personally don't think deeply held beliefs or ideas are worth respecting without reason,  it even my own.  But  I don't mean to sound or be dismissive of your beliefs or anyone.\n Hopefully that makes some  sense. \n\nI'm still not seeing the dui equivalent to body autonomy and terminating a pregnancy\n\nI get the personhood aspect though. \nTo me it's that the fetus  depends on the mothers body and imposes many risks including death or long and short term health impacts. Pregnancy is fairly routine now but loss of baby and mother are historically very common. The fetus even if it hits a personhood milestone before 20 weeks (before 20 weeks is medically an abortion), is imposing a risk and staying inside the mothers body and imposing it's life on the mother.\n\nI think you see it as the reverse? That mother is choosing to kill the personhood (granting you this just for the ease of argument, but I do not share that definition).\n\nI think a lot of people not faced with the real situation and all it's complexity possibly do invent  a strawman that people get abortions just for convenience or not taking responsibility for their actions.  There going to be spectrum and people tend to not like the fatigue of nuanced spectrums.\n\nWhile I would be perfectly fine with less abortions, I would not want that at the cost of loss of body autonomy. But that again isn't nuanced enough.\n\nI also think banning abortions will not reduce abortions, they will only lead to unsafe abortions more suffering and more poverty, crime etc as that's what the data shows so far. \n\nI think solving the problem the best way will involve lots of uncomfortable conversations, taking into a count personhood, as I do think many feel as you and I don't fault them for it. It probably won't involve  any broad legislation (at least not first),  and may seem counter intuitive to 'common sense' similar the war on drugs. \n\nI respectfully remain counter, and again appreciate and respect your position.",

Pregnancy is also an onslaught on the human body not to mention life risking.

I can't say nobody uses frequent abortions as their primary birth control but it would surprise me if someone did considering all the other easier options. I also feel another \"so what?\" applies here. Consenting sex is not inherently immoral even if it's frequent and/or with strangers. It may be a bad idea but rarely effects the people who didn't choose to be involved. Abortion being illegal will not stop any actual sexual abuse. It will only make things worse for victims.",

Life was crazy and brutal back then and god had to do some weird shit to get his people through it. Jesus flipped the script, though, so we don't need to deal with all that craziness anymore. Just the bits and pieces that they decide are still relevant, like the Ten Commandments.\n\nNow, abortion is clearly murder, and thus the Commandment against killing thy neighbor covers it. No need for any specific mention outlawing it. \n\nRe: point 3, I'm not sure that anyone specifically argues that as in and of itself a reason not to allow abortion. The straw man of callous women using abortion as birth control is more of a way to discredit its necessity. The implication is that they don't *need* abortions, they just *want* them. It's a convenience to them. Therefore, arguments about how damaging it is to women's health to outlaw them are just bad faith arguments to cover up their desire to be able to have unprotected sex without any responsibility for consequences.",

But they are not particularly different than infanticide of a newborn, which I also agree should be a crime.\n\nSo abortion in the first trimester should 100% be legal and also through the second trimester.  There starts to be a gray area where I can see multiple valid points of view on the subject starting around ~22 weeks when the baby has some chance of surviving an emergency c-section with a long stay in the NICU.  Personally I consider myself strongly pro-choice and I don't have a problem with outlawing *elective* late third trimester abortions and can see it as a valid belief to try and stop elective third trimester/late second trimester abortions (with exceptions for medical necessity and rape).  That said, if the goal is to stop abortions late in the pregnancy, I think a much better solution that outlawing medical procedures is mandatory sex ed (so people recognize the signs of pregnancy and know their options for birth control), more access to contraceptives and plan B pills, and pregnancy tests as well as more access to first-trimester abortions if they want to have one.",

I'm pretty sure every state has laws against late term abortions. That's not good enough for anti-abortion activists, though. That's why they have continuously pushed for laws that argue that the standard should be earlier and earlier signs of development.\n\nGreat if you can find common ground with them on late term abortions, but that wouldn't actually change anything.

But when you're actively saying it, you're lending the illusion of rationality to the anti-abortion crew that they truly don't have, which then gives them public perception of not being the psychos that they are, which allows them to continue spreading their bullshit. \n\nIt's not what this guy is saying, because it's alright. It's the unintentional message he's sending that \"you know, maybe the forced-birthers have a point\". If you give them event he illusion of an inch, they'll run a mile with it, and we don't need nor want conservatives getting any distance whatsoever.",

He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah[a] of barley flour on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy, a reminder-offering to draw attention to wrongdoing.\n\n>16 \u201c\u2018The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord. 17 Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water. 18 After the priest has had the woman stand before the Lord, he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy, while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse. 19 Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, \u201cIf no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you. 20 But if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband\u201d\u2014 21 here the priest is to put the woman under this curse\u2014\u201cmay the Lord cause you to become a curse[b] among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell. 22 May this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.\u201d\n\n>\u201c\u2018Then the woman is to say, \u201cAmen. So be it.\u201d\n\n>23 \u201c\u2018The priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water. 24 He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her. 25 The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the Lord and bring it to the altar. 26 The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial[c] offering and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water. 27 If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse. 28 If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.\n\n>29 \u201c\u2018This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and makes herself impure while married to her husband, 30 or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the Lord and is to apply this entire law to her. 31 The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin.\u2019\u201d",

Though also Buffalo (Kearney) grew 8.64% and Hall (Grand Island) by 7.32%.\n\nWhile 38 counties have less than 5,000 inhabitants and only one of them that didn't lose population (Thomas) only gained 22 (647 to 669), and 67 counties are under 10,000 and only 7 didn't lose population.\n\nThe Douglas-Lancaster-Sarpy counties together had a 14.19% population growth, while all other together lost population by 0.14%. And wow, in 1990, these three counties made up 46.42% of Nebraska population, but the percentage really has grown, passed the 50% mark in the 2000s and in 2020 census was 56%.\n\nThe city of Omaha itself grew 6%, Lincoln 12.5%, Bellevue and Papillion (Omaha burbs) 20+%. Though oddly even Grand Island and Kearney grew by 9.2%.",

I am from a town under 400 people and we have one of the higher amounts of democrats in our county for rural counties. One of the major things though is ag....republicans have better ag policies...again don't mention subsidies lol. I did get some weird looks in 2020 when someone made a comment about how of course we all will vote for trump and I said not even if hell freezes over and I'd vote for a used condom before voting Trump. Then they asked if I honestly thought Biden was better than Trump and I said it was obvious...he is average at best. That one confused many lol...they still like my bacon horseradish Mac n cheese though",

The children who are already here and need us right now. \n\nIt's been shown time and time again that proper sexual education and access to birth control reduces both STDs and teen pregnancy more than \"abstaince only\" education. \n\nAbortion is birth control. If you think a r*pe victim should be forced to have their attacker's child, you're a bad person. If you think a child should be forced to have a child, you're wrong. If you think a woman who has been told childbirth should KILL her to have a child, you're a bad person. \n\nEven if the birth itself isn't the problem, we don't need to be bringing in children just to toss them in orphanages. We can reduce abuse, poverty, and more. Let's solve the real issues here. We need access to abortion. Better sex ed. Not more church control.",

And as it says, she is from Omaha. Neither city is really progressive though, rather more purplish.\n\nAlso, if you noticed it in the last election, Biden won one electoral vote in Nebraska. Because Nebraska has three congressional districts, so 5 electors, and the electoral votes are distributed that who wins the statewide popular vote wins two votes, other three are distributed by who wins in a district. Obama in 2008 and Biden in 2020 both won the second district, which is Omaha-anchored. However, the district still has a Republican Congressman. The last Democrat to represent it was quite moderate, he was one of only two nationwide to flip a red seat blue in 2014, but then lost in 2016. Then in the last two elections (2018 and 2020, the Democratic candidate was a progressive more aligned with Bernie, and she lost, even as Biden carried the district in 2020). And the city still has a Republican mayor.\n\nAnd the article doesn't say \"Democrats\" or \"Republicans\". That is because Nebraska legislature is non-partisan:\n\n> There are no formal party alignments or groups within the Legislature. Coalitions tend to form issue by issue based on a member's philosophy of government, geographic background, and constituency. However, almost all the members of the legislature are known to be either Democrats or Republicans, and the state branches of both parties explicitly endorse candidates for legislative seats.",

The two blue areas - Omaha and Lincoln - make up approximately 40% of the state population, and if you also include Omaha's southern suburbs in Sarpy County (200k), then you have 56% of state population.\n\nRest of Nebraska though is extremely rural and agricultural, largest city outside Omaha/Lincoln (Grand Island) is 50k population and largest county 62k. All those counties outside of the three most populated are really low population/low density, varying from 0.5 to 109 people/sq mi. For them, they are probably not so much pro-Republican or pro-Trump, but more of \"the devil you know\", something like \"at least they won't come in and take our guns away, unlike them Democrats\".\n\nSo probably Democrats might do better in rural areas if they dropped gun control, or the more overarching ideas. Many (mainly) rural counties are declaring themselves \"Second Amendment sanctuary counties\", some states (even Texas) have declared themselves \"Second Amendment sanctuary states\", which pretty much means that the bodies of government have adopted the resolutions stating that they will not enforce certain gun control measures, which they perceive as anti-Second Amendment.\n\nThink Rick Wilson (a Never Trump former Republican strategist) said something like \"The left won the culture war on gay marriage, the right won the culture war on guns, abortion is the culture war still ongoing.\"\n\nBefore Obama, Dems used to be somewhat more competitive in more rural areas, but they were quite conservative Dems, more focused on fiscal issues (minimum wage) and healthcare/social programs, while probably not very pro-gay marriage or abortion. Probably Montana being an honorable exception, Max Baucus was pro-choice, and while he voted for DOMA in 1998, later voted against Federal Marriage Amendment, for repealing Don't Ask, Don't Tell, and spoke in favor of gay marriage later; and also quite pro-gun, though he voted for the original AWB in 1994, voted against it in 2013. Think Jon Tester has also voted quite same way.",

One congressional district in Southwestern Indiana (Evansville) is now deeply Republican, but back when Democrats still used to be competitive there (it was a notorious swing district, ousting many incumbents from both parties), the Democrats who won there were conservative Blue Dogs, more often than not pro-life and pro-gun.

They elected a mayor, not even from this city. She lives in the nicest neighborhood in Omaha. Omaha is a middle class city, AT BEST. Now explain to me how this non-native, elitist is going to come in and *fix* this city\u2019s most glaring problems. Was it not a red-flag when her husband walked out on his front lawn and shot himself in the head? What the fuck was that about!?!? Not even living in the nicest neighborhood in town or having a great career at UNMC is enough to keep oneself from ending their life in Omaha. \n\nNot even 3 years ago, Omaha paid half a million dollars to an advertising company OUT OF COLORADO (it was the cheapest bid, mind you) to come up with a new state slogan. Do you all remember what that slogan was?? \u201cNebraska, it\u2019s not for everybody.\u201d\n\nHave a million fucking dollars, *poof*. LOL! A thousand dollars right now would change my life. It\u2019s almost unbelievable, but it\u2019s real. This really happened. These are the real life, apparently complex, decisions that people who \u201cyou\u201d vote for are making all without anyone\u2019s opinion or knowledge. My opinion would have been KEEP THAT FUCKING MONEY IN OUR STATE. I would have given this state the best slogan ever, for FREE.     F.R.E.E. \n\n\u201cOh, Omaha is a great place. We just love Omaha.\u201d -out of towner Berkshire holders, CWS diehards, TD Ameritrade & ConAgra execs.\n\nEdit: Listen, I would move in a heartbeat to get out of Barnam & Bailey\u2019s revolving circus here but ironically, I can\u2019t afford it.

I was just talking to my coworker at the youth shelter about how people here like to pretend there isn't a homeless population at all and how they like to pretend there isn't a meth problem at all either. \n\nI really like that I can avoid people a lot where I am at even though it's the biggest city in the Panhandle and I like there are a lot of places I can go hiking. I generally hate interacting with the people who wish it was still 40 years ago and pretend if you just pull yourself up by your bootstraps you wouldn't be in [insert whatever struggle a person is going through].",

The truth is here people sleep in their cars, under the bridges/overpasses, crash with someone they know for the night, and anywhere else they aren't readily seen by the public or the police. \n\nPeople don't see the homeless because they aren't your stereotype, but they are here. We tend, as regular folks, not count people who couch surf or scrape together money for a night in a hotel as homeless, but they are according to government statistics. They don't have a regular home to go to. They crash where they can. \n\nMeth is still #1 here, but fentynol and heroin are rising as well.\n\nEveryone talks a good talk about wanting to fix things, but once people are asked to step up and help, they're nowhere to be seen, it's not their problem, or they don't want \"those\" people in their neighborhood. It's really sad and sometimes frustrating.",

They are very pro-birth, but not so pro-life. Fact is women will always have abortions, legal or not. Should we be like some lawmakers and take it a step further and seek to investigate miscarriages? If life begins at conception, and a woman miscarries, did a human baby die? Should we have a coroner examine the child? Should the family, by law, be forced to properly bury or otherwise dispose of the remains? If you truly believe that a human baby begins at conception, then you'll need to be consistent, and the 10-15% of women who miscarry will need to be investigated for accidental death, which is actually an idea a few pro-life lawmakers have floated. \n\nEither way, the US does a shit job of caring for children. We have a higher rate of childhood poverty than other 1st world nations. I'd like abortion to be rare, safe, and legal. We make abortions rare by providing solid science-based sex education to all teens of appropriate ages, as well as offering free contraception (I am super excited about the new male \"pill\" they are developing so that men will have to deal with some of the same side effects women deal with in terms of hormonal birth control; it's time we paid our dues don't you think?) of any kind. Lowering unwanted pregnancies will lower the number of abortions. Unfortunately, many many pro-lifers also tend to be against sex education, and even some are full-stop against contraception in any form, as it is \"God's Will.\"\n\nBut if you are a pro-lifer that believes in fully funded childcare, from cradle to at least 18, we're talking healthcare, school, food, housing, etc... and full on support for families with children, to make it less likely kids will grow up in poverty, as well as science-based sex ed programs and free or super low cost contraceptives handed out like candy, then we can probably at least understand one another. \n\nMy final thought if that a nation such as the US that has bombed, shot, starved, and otherwise murdered millions of babies and children abroad since WW2, I'm not sure we can ever truly be a pro-life nation.",

That *is* taking responsibility over the pregnancy, taking a decision letting it go on or not. Nowhere do I see that \"taking responsibility\" *must mean* \"forcing birth / carrying to term\".\n\nBut that's just a response to your comment about that specific scenario; my view is as I said for any reason at any time. At no point does the right of a developing fetus trump the female's carrying it without her consent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>just have an unprotected sex then get an abortion if you conceive. no biggie.\n\nGoing through an abortion is not \"no biggie\". It's harrowing for most. Especially with the harassment that usually follows. But if someone rather go once a year and clean their teeth at a dentist compared to brushing their teeth regularly or other more reasonable ways of dealing with it, I'm going to call that the worse option and have them think about being smarter about it. That doesn't mean I want to deny them their right to do it. I don't have to agree with their choice to acknowledge they do have that right. Conflating the two seems to me to be unjustified.\n\nLuckily we know from statistics that this reality of people \"have sex then 'just' have an abortion\" is as uncommon as it gets. But again, just because there are better ways of going about it I won't deny them their right of doing so, so it's indeed a non-factor for me.",

Not that they should have to take responsibility, but what responsibility actually means in this context. For me, it's the responsibility towards the female, you seem to make it toward the fetus. I don't see how that's justified as I can't think of any reason whatsoever why I should value the fetus's rights in that equation over the female's right to bodily autonomy. Consent to sex isn't divesting oneself of that right. To me, forced birth just seems like some weird form of punishment. On my view getting an abortion is taking responsibility for the pregnancy, or taking responsibility of being-in-the-state-of-pregnant, rather, but I'm all with you that there are better ways to try not to get there it but on my view it doesn't change anything when it comes to rights. \n\nI'm very open to hearing arguments on why the fetus' rights should be valued over the female's, or have rights whatsoever. I don't see a fetus as a moral entity that can have rights in the first place, but I'm listening if you're willing. But stupidity of not taking all precautions or when they weren't enough, isn't enough to punish someone with forced birth / carrying to term whether she agreed to sex or not.",

The female has the responsibility to not get pregnant in the first place (if she has no intent to carry through with it.)

Consent to sex is one thing, consent to pregnancy is another. Just because one can lead to the other doesn't you can bunch them together as one. Deciding to end the pregnancy or not is taking responsibility to the situation. As I've said before, I don't see how \"taking responsibility\" can mean and only mean carrying to term, when there's clearly another option here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In this scenario, do you still give absolutely ZERO moral worth to the fetus? Do you see nothing morally wrong with a couple/woman deliberately getting pregnant over and over and over again just so they can get an abortion?\n\nAlmost zero. The capability of becoming something of moral worth makes it a non-zero. But we're deep into the decimals here and nothing that is worth mentioning in the same sentence as right to bodily autonomy of someone I deem a person. I don't see it *morally* wrong to get abortions over and over, I see it as a bad solution given the trauma it often inflicts on the one terminating the pregnancy when contraception exists and they simply chose not to go that route.\n\nBut also, did you actually mean it the way you wrote it there? That they get pregnant just so that they can have an abortion? That the goal is to have abortions, for the sake of abortions? In either case I think my answers covers it, I just find the hypothetical weird.",

Meaning:\n\nIf you can't garner any sympathy for the baby in such a scenario, nor feel the parents have done anything wrong in such a scenario, then clearly we just fundamentally disagree on this issue.\n\nI do not believe that a woman should be allowed to deliberately and repeatedly have abortions for reasons like enjoyment or because she simply prefers how sex feels without condom, or anything else equally as superficial.",

The difference is whether the woman has the obligation to carry that fetus to term. In cases of rape, she had no choice in the matter, and so the answer is no.

She can take responsibility by getting an abortion which is not murder, so please remove the false misconception from your future responses.\n\n>Under perfect conditions so the numbers lower.\n\n>Less reason to claim getting pregnant is some unlikely event that you don't need to take responsibility for then\n\nLower meaning a higher chance of it failing. Regardless she's taking responsibility so I suggest against misframing this as avoiding responsibility when that's never been the case.\n\n>Again they can take responsibility by getting an abortion.\n\n>Murder is not a justified method of taking responsibility. \n\nMurder is a legal term meaning an unjustified killing.  Abortion is justified by human rights and equality between genders. I don't want to sound harsh,but if you're still new to this and in the abortion is murder phase, then you have much to learn.\n\n>This is like if someone was going to testify against Putin in court and Putin was like, \"yeah I just took responsibility by murdering that witness. Totally cool, right?\"\n\nNot analogous to abortion at all. Put in has an obligation to not murder a person with rights. You're conflating that with a fetus, that's violating someone's rights. Big difference.\n\n>How so? \n\n>Pregnancy is a known risk of having sex. Therefore consent to sex is consent to the potential of getting pregnant. \n\n>Do you disagree?\n\nOfcourse I disagree because consent to sex is only Consent to sex. You're conflating acknowledging risk with consent. Consent related to one's body has to be explicit, ongoing, and can be revoked. If she doesn't consent to pregnancy continuing she can take responsibility by getting an abortion which kills the fetus but is not murder by definition.",

Is it that difficult for you to state that a fetus has some value?\n\nI'm pretty sure I answered it ealier but I'll double check. There's no context explaining why she is doing this, and this isn't something women generally do so what I see wrong with this is her mindset. But this has nothing to do with deciding value on the fetus. Is it that hard to not come to baseless conclusions?\n\nEdit: so I guess I did answer but in a way to ask for more context because your hypothetical wasn't clear enough.",

For example, I got kids myself. Whether it be from evolutionary reasons or others, me and my partner had plans about the \"baby\" that despite it not technically being a person even before successful conception and most definitely after, we treated it as such as I think almost all does.

Just because I just met someone a stranger and I have no history with them and never will have any other interaction with them after, doesn\u2019t mean I value their life any less than my mothers.\n\nNeither do I. It's not their relation to me or any one person that matters, it's their relation to properties giving them moral worth that's the basis for the assessment. Having the genetic makeup of a homo-sapiens seems very arbitrary to me, but feel free to explain why that matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You contradict yourself in the second paragraph. How can say our lives, our existence on an individual basis are so astronomically insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe, then suddenly put value on unquantifiable attributes that make up that speck of stardust? It\u2019s because in the end values are subjective, while the basis of my argument is not.\n\nI haven't said anything that contradicts with \"our existence on an individual basis are so astronomically insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe\". The only way you could get to that conclusion is if you're reading, to me, your arbitrary value of genetic makeup into it as the only thing of value. Then that would've contradicted it, not otherwise.\n\nBut when you've now brought the cosmos up I will affirm the cosmic part nonetheless, from a cosmic perspective we're as irrelevant as the next thing. It doesn't care one bit unless you read into it some agency capable of caring and having opinions of its inhabitants. What I clearly wrote that mattered to me was \"personhood, consciousness, moral worth depending on that, and so forth. That doesn't contradict anything in regards to if the cosmos values us or not.\n\nAnd by valuing I'm obviously talking about agents capable of valuing things, so it goes without saying that it's subjective. If that's somehow supposed to be a critique then I'm not sure what you are on about. That's all we got but if you think you have some objective thing to point out in the cosmos that sets value on things, please demonstrate the veracity of that claim and I will most certainly be persuaded that it exists. Whether we ought to arbitrarily accept that standard or think it has any reason to be the best standard to use for us humans, will still end up grounding it subjectively. You cannot go from an IS to an OUGHT without smuggling in a subjective goal, so it will still be grounded subjectively.",

I'm glad we can have it without agreeing on everything. \n\n\"Doing something that makes someone else happier or less sad is clearly a good thing to do\" \n\n If it's left up to everyone else, then really it's just someone else's opinion. Why is their opinion more valid than someone else's? We have words like sadism which defines someone that derives pleasure ( arguably \"happier\" depending on how you look at it) that is based on the suffering of another. It's these contradictions that make this topic hard. Especially this one depending on if you personally believe the aborted baby to be \"someone\" or not. I would argue that could the baby express itself, it would clearly indicate it was not happy.\n\nFor the record, my potentially very unpopular opinion is that I very much disagree with abortion unless it comes down to the health of the child vs health of the mother. If you did not choose to have the child due to abuse or the actions of another imposed upon you, give the child up for adoption if that is something you need to do, but don't deprive it of what could be a fulfilling life. Otherwise, take responsibility for your own actions and either raise the child yourself or allow someone else who wants to do it via adoption.\n\nI don't agree that the dog knows he did something wrong. I think the dog can sense the emotions of people around them. But that's another discussion about dogs. :)\n\nThanks again for chatting and keeping it positive and respectful. I appreciate you. There is a lot more of these conversations needed in the future. \n\nHopping off for now. Have a good night.",

Because a developed society that has an access to strong education leads to more intelligent individuals who understand the benefits or harms of the actions of their decisions. This is why if you look at countries that routinely struggle to educate their population and also have strong economic disparity. These people heavily lean on religion and yet still commit acts of violence and sin. There are gang members here in the States that actively commit gun violence and then pray their actions away because they believe it's justified to get back for the loss of their friend or family. Reguardless of what the Bible says, these Christians are still committing sins because of how they develop their own moral codes and their environments.",

You literally cannot tell the difference between most mammalian fetuses because they all derived from a common ancestor. There is definitely still trauma that comes with abortions, but at the same time it's even more traumatic to force women to have to take their rape to turn or to completely change how their lives are going to end up simply because you don't want them to get access to a simple procedure to stop fetus from developing into a human. The woman herself should not get to say in any of this and we should still force that living human with its own realities and experiences into this world? The mom didn't really want the child or the parents going to actively be enough to kick care of the child? Our Foster care systems are heavily overburdened so definitely shouldn't.

I understand we don't agree on the argument itself, I was trying to understand the logic behind it to get a different perspective. You can't argue that it isn't a human life when they are talking delivering the kid and then killing it after.

You can't look at some stupid b******* thing that you believe in that isn't true and use it to justify other things that aren't true. Nobody is trying to f****** have post birth abortions That's stupid and dumb and illogical and I've actually mind blown that you said this. Brain is actually f****** frying itself that somebody thinks this stupid thing. See the problem is you're telling me I can't argue with the human life when you're literally. Then after saying that only saying I can't do so because you're incorrect definition is what you're using to justify my statement. But scientifically a fetus is not a human look at a dolphin fetus looking an elephant fetus. Look at a f****** rabbit fetus and look at a dog fetus and tell me that you can easily tell the difference between all of them. The fundamental thing attached to the woman is literally a parasite during all terms that abortions should be legal and it literally can't do anything on its own, but it's not a living thing. It can't survive into on its own and can't think on its own. It can't make its own heartbeat it can't provide its own nutrients. It literally is just a bunch of cells that the mother throws nutrients too because it can't survive on its own.",

The deadly plagues cast onto the Egyptians by God or I'll explain about through science and yet have never been historically recorded or geologically shown to have happened at all the same time within a range of time close to what the Bible accounts. The very moral ideas of the god of the Old testament are different from the God of the New testament, which also does not make sense. If you're going to take something as history, why are the two parts of it Incompatible. Also, why is the resurrection story of Jesus given three separate times with a different account on each occasion of how he reveals himself or is discovered upon resurrecting?",

And keep in mind that condoms can fail, just like pills can. Or how about when a married couple are in severe emotional distress and one thing leads to another, and they both decide to has sex? Sure, it's not rape, but it most certainly is not the conscious decision to make a parasite, it's simply a natural way to respond to stress and extreme emotions. \n\nI'm sorry that you have no comprehension of the meaning of the word \"empathy\", but that should be expected from forced-birthers.\n\n>That just proves it isn't about rape at all\n\nNo, it proves that pro-abortion folks actually care about their fellow human beings. \n\n>only as a means to not be subjected to the consequences of one's consensual actions.\n\nDo you know what the consequence should be? The consequence should be one doctors visit, and that's that. No potential death from the child, no potential death from the zygote ending up in the wrong spot, no incapacitation of the unfortunate mother, no economic and emotional strain on the family unit, and most certainly none of the bullshit that you're spouting. \n\nWhy do you think that these people should be punished? Why do you hate your fellow human so much that you think they should be forced to suffer? Are you turned on by the suffering of others, or do you somehow profit off of it?",

Don't tell me abortion is the worst thing ever while also opposing things that prevent abortion.\n\nIf you want me to take them seriously, they need to show the faintest inkling of consistency first.

They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the sake of \u201cThe Unborn.\u201d  \n  \nThere's no mess, no confusion. Just a nice and tidy little bundle to help you reaffirm your self-righteousness. You don't actually have to be a decent person in order to defend a fetus, but you might trick some people, including yourself, into thinking that you are.",

And there are a lot of people getting all worked up over statements that are not true.  Ideally abortion should be safe, legal, rare, and done early on in the pregnancy.  It\u2019s rare to find someone who has a problem with plan B or 1st trimester abortions,  but I find these pushes for being able to kill a fully developed baby to be kinda sick and twisted.",

But regardless, you can't say corruption when it's going to be on both sides regardless. You have to simply look at the political arguments and then decide on that. And the conservatives have routinely made harmful decisions that only benefit specific groups while actively harming the economic majority. I'm tired of people being fueled by their emotional b******* so that they can just abuse them. Economically I refuse to listen to people telling me that their politically equivalent in terms of their arguments. Please tell me exactly what you think.

And lately there have been quite a few bills which seem designed to get rid of abortion entirely, without allowing for any exceptions. And these kind of bills are almost always linked to fringe extremist groups of a religious nature.\n\nBasically, pattern recognition leads people to associate hardline anti-abortion policies with religious extremism because odds are those groups are involved.",

Basically, if someone honestly believes that a fetus is a person with rights, these people would consider the well-being of both the child and the mother and while most of the time they lean in favour of the fetus circumstances can make them lean in favour of the mother.\n\nThe simplest example: rape is an absolutely horrid experience which causes the vast majority of its victims to experience a lifetime of suffering. To then also force the victim to give birth to the child which resulted from the rape, another experience which will affect the rest of their life and almost certainly in a negative manner, means that from a utilitarian perspective the amount of suffering inflicted upon that single person outweighs the fetus's right to live (not to mention the child probably won't live a happy life either).\n\nOf course, this still runs into the problem that a fetus is a clumb of cells and not a person, but we're assuming that we're dealing with a utilitarian who believes that fetuses are also people.",

Human brains are entirely capable of holding two ideas which flatly contradict each other.\n\nHowever, words are wind. If you try to predict their behaviour based on the model that they actually, honestly believe this, [you will find yourself continually surprised](http://amptoons.com/blog/?p=13565), just like if you try to navigate with a map of the Flat Earth.\n\n----\n\n>and while most of the time they lean in favour of the fetus circumstances can make them lean in favour of the mother...\n\nIf you think that a fetus is morally equivalent to a thinking, feeling, human being, and that this entitles you to force women to carry pregnancies to term against their will, it shouldn't matter how that fetus got there.\n\n\nIf, on the other hand, you respect a woman's right to decide what happens to her body without coercive interference, it **still** shouldn't matter how that fetus got there.\n\nThe **only** argument that's consistent with \"abortion should be legal for people who were raped and illegal for everyone else\" is the argument that **women who choose to have sex deserve to be punished for it**. That is the [**real** primary motivation](http://amptoons.com/blog/?p=13565) of the \"pro-life\" movement, far moreso than any hogwash about \"protecting unborn children\".\n\nThis sort of position is inconsistent from every direction. And quite frankly, it's morally disgusting. You're essentially admitting that your position has nothing to do with \"protecting the sanctity of life\", and everything to do with punishing women who have sex.\n\nPlease examine closely your motivations for holding these positions. Because they don't add up.\n\nFurthermore, once you've conceded that you are \"only\" trying to deny fundamental human rights to women who *haven't also* suffered Hardships X, Y, and Z, you have the problem of determining which women *qualify* for this most gracious exemption.\n\nSuppose you think that you're justified in forcing a woman to give birth against her will *unless* the fetus was conceived as the result of rape. How do you propose to *prove* whether this was the case? Does the rapist need to have been arrested? Charged? Convicted? If by some miracle this process hasn't already taken nine months, will you also require a paternity test to prove that the fetus definitely belongs to the attacker who was convicted, that it couldn't possibly have been conceived as the result of consensual sex that she coincidentally had at some point in the same month that she suffered a sexual assault? Will you inquire into her personal habits, subject her to invasive medical examinations, force her to submit to a detailed and humiliating inquiry in order prove to your satisfaction that it was a \"legitimate rape\", that she was sufficiently \"pure\" and \"honourable\", that she wasn't a \"slut\" who was \"asking for it\"?\n\nIf all you require is a checkbox on a form that says \"Yeah, I was totally raped, I pinkie promise!\", the process is a meaningless formality and serves no valid purpose. If you require **anything more invasive than that**, then your proposal represents an unconscionable violation of the patient's right to privacy, and serves no valid purpose. Either way, the only thing you're accomplishing when you call for such a measure is to Virtue Signal your own totalitarian misogyny.",

The point of banning it all outright is to finally or at least to get a dictation of where the  line is? Where do we draw the line? Because right now there isn't a line. It's absolutely allowed to happen for any reason. No questions asked or hey, how about we don't take a life because somebody else caused a problem. So they're obviously needs to be a middle ground. So by introducing a law that is strictly siding for one side, it's going to force the other side to pick a middle ground. You're going to have to find a place to dictate a middle ground.

But at least I'm willing to offer solutions versus just looking at a problem and complaining about it. Again I know how I was raised and how i was raised and the people around me were raised and none of us ended up fucked up none of us ended up pregnant in our teenage years. None of us knocked up chicks in her teenage years. It's kind of easy to do when you live with moral values.\n\nBut unless you have a better idea I would totally love to hear it out because that's what discussions are for two parties or multiple parties to learn from one another. So do you have a solution to that do you have a solution to any of this are you willing to offer or make solutions for it. Or you going to be one of the wallflowers that sits there and only points at the fact that we're trying to offer solutions and trying to help but you're going to contribute absolutely nothing why because that's what contrarians do.",

Maybe if it actually made a difference in the world, but a reddit discussion hardly qualifies. There are much better ways to contribute to society than do this.\n\nHowever, you'll have a field day if I live you hanging on that last bit.\n\n>Or you going to be one of the wallflowers that sits there and only points at the fact that we're trying to offer solutions and trying to help but you're going to contribute absolutely nothing why because that's what contrarians do.\n\nComprehensive and proper sex education in schools and better availability for contraception are two prime examples that help reduce teen pregnancies.\n\nAlso literally what democrats and leftists have been advocating for, for years. If you were here to learn, you would have known this by now.",
