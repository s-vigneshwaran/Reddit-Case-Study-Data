I think they've been severely misled by the likes of Limbaugh and O'Reily and their ilk over the last 35 years and it breaks my heart, but writing them off completely would stop me from being able to rebuke their narrow idea of what is morally right, to discuss topics of humanity from a perspective they would otherwise never encounter.    \nIt's not easy and sometimes it can become a shouting match, but I try to come at it from a place of love and acceptance, and forgiveness especially when they show they are willing to change or at least stop being reactionary. There is no way forward in peace without communication, understanding and above all grace. I may vehemently disagree with their political stances, but hatred will never change their minds - hatred and violence digs a grave for everyone.",

Honesty,  for example,  is just easier over the long term. Not only is it hard to keep track of your lies but once people catch you in lies they no longer trust your word. Being honest just makes sense.\n\nBeing logical led me ironically to follow Jesus's more positive commandments but I also think those rules are found in most  faiths because religions were created by a social species to show its followers how to live in a society.",

Because they lend themselves a veneer of credence to this exact argument. Their vote does the same amount of damage as a maga white nationalist, but they somehow get a pass because they're otherwise a good person? No, absolutely not. They don't get to vote to shit on poor people or demonize minorities or take rights away from women and then claim to be a good person. Because at that point they are not good people.",

That means an America where white people were a large majority, where their desires were officially prioritized over minorities, where women were subjugated, where Christianity functioned as something akin to a state religion.\n\nThe thing is that fundamentalist Christianity is a belief system that claims to function as a complete, overarching philosophy of life -- i.e. there's really nothing worthwhile to learn or practice that wasn't prescribed by Christianity. So if you believe in that brand of Christianity and you believe in white supremacy, you must believe that Christianity prescribes white supremacy.",

First, I would like to point out that 100% of the Capitol rioters would also identify as American, yet we know a likely majority of Americans does not support their ideologies. Without hard data, it is difficult to guess about the makeup of a whole group from the small, clearly biased, sample of the Capitol rioters. The source has some quantitative statistics of white Americans, and where on the Christian nationalism scale they fall, but focuses more on the ways they can identify Christian nationalism and the qualities of the group. The quantitative study finds over half of white Americans to \"generally affirm\" christian nationalism, but only 21% fall into what they described as \"true believers\" of Christian nationalism.\n\nAs for in what way they are imposters, the source only mentions the term once, saying that \"[white Christian nationalism] can be understood as sort of an imposter christianity\". I think CNN uses the term unfaithfully, as the source exclusively refers to the group as White Christian Nationalism, except for, I believe, this one line exception. As for the use of the term then, they say their study found that \"once we account for WCN\u2019m, being more religiously devout is associated with lower levels of prejudice\", along with pointing to differences in WCN'm discourse, coming mostly from the Book of Revelations, and civil religion, which \"draws on the social justice tradition of the Hebrew prophets\" and the \"civic republican tradition that runs from Aristotle through Machiavelli\".\n\nThey reference a variety of books in the conversation, reading through and checking out those books would provide more context that I do not have.",

Hitler was not only the world's most famous Catholic but according to Paul Johnson the Catholic historian 50% of the Waffen SS were confessing Catholics. & Prayers were said for Hitler all the way until the very end by order of the Vatican. And not a single one of them was ever even threatened with excommunication for their participation in the final solution.....One of them was excommunicated. Joseph Goebbels.... But not for the crime of killing millions of Jews.... But...... Wait for it...... For marrying a Protestant....After all they have to draw a line in the sand somewhere \ud83e\udd23\n\nIt was the first treaty Hitler ever signed that gave him significant power and that was when he convinced them to give him control of the political system in exchange he would give them control of the education system. After all, what better way to indoctrinate the youth. Of course they still haven't found a way to apologize for it and whatever you want to call that.. you cannot call it secular.\n\nIt can be truthfully argued that Hitler didn't personally believe any of that Christian nonsense. And most of his beliefs were rooted in pagan and Nordic blood myth, leader worship and large doses of methamphetamine and oxycodone... Nonetheless the result was the result. And there's no reason to believe that the Catholic Church suspected he didn't believe it.\n\n  \n\n\nAfter all it must be remembered that it wasn't until the Vatican two council that the Catholic Church withdrew the charge of Deicide (the death of a god) from the Jewish people as a whole. For those who wish to look it up this occurred during the years 1962 through 1965. Long long after the end of the second world war.",

How come the fuhrer oath that every officer of the Party and the Army had to take, making Hitler into a minor god, begins, \u201cI swear in the name of almighty God, my loyalty to the Fuhrer?\u201d How come that on the belt buckle of every Nazi soldier it says Gott mit uns, God on our side? How come that the first treaty made by the Nationalist Socialist dictatorship, the very first is with the Vatican? It\u2019s exchanging political control of Germany for Catholic control of German education. How come that the church has celebrated the birthday of the Fuhrer every year, on that day until democracy put an end to this filthy, quasi-religious, superstitious, barbarous, reactionary system?\n\n  \n\n\nAgain, this is not a difference of emphasis between us.

We can observe what they claim to believe, we can observe if their actions are consistent with their purported beliefs, but we simply cannot know beyond that.\n\nSo what makes someone a Christian, and can we know? Is it them calling themselves a Christian? Going to church? Tithing? Reading the bible? Believing in God and Jesus? Believing in church doctrine? Believing in the literal word of the bible? And if we decide on what is necessary for someone to be a true Christian, then what percentage of the people who call themselves Christians actually meet the cutoff? \n\nI think we have to treat religion like gender, and if someone says they are a Christian then they are a Christian (though we can deny that they are part of certain sects if they don't go to church or have been excommunicated).  It's too easy to veer off into \"no true Scotsman\" territory, otherwise.\n\nSo was Hitler a Christian? I thankfully don't know enough about him to say.  Maybe he didn't identify as one after he grew up.  Maybe he believed in the mythology but not the church itself? I honestly couldn't say.",

What god was it that Jesus was pushing everyone to worship? That's rights Yahweh the Old Testament god.  The same god who pushed for genocide over and over, took human sacrifice to strengthen an army and kills this who make fun of others by having them eaten by bears.\n\nJesus was leftist compared to their standards but  was still crazy conservative compared to today. Extremely radical, pushing for complete self destruction, tribalistic and again bringing on worship of a bigoted monster god. Outside the Gospels the NT doesn't get much better as it continues to reinforce the idea of Jesus as \"the sword\" view of this end times cult.\n\nI agree with you on the extreme nature of fundies but I think the split is that \"normies\" only know the handful of passages covered during Sunday service and don't dig much deeper than that. Does this stop them from pushing an exclusionary agenda? Nope. They still vote for conservatives who push bigotry. They still fund and keep the church around which only gives more power to the hatemongers. So while the normal Christians may be in line with the portion of the Bible they hear about on Sundays, it doesn't really stop them from creating this problematic world.",

                  "text": "I think you're looking at it the wrong way.\n\nThe majority of the planet believes in a supernatural being, something unfalsifiable that there is absolutely zero demonstrable evidence for. This means they are already setup for belief in potentially harmful things if someone can demonstrate that this supernatural being thinks they should harm others. That being doesn't seem to show up to resolve this issue.\n\nSo the question becomes, how difficult is it to show that their religion promoted hate and violence? For the Abrahamic religions you need only read their holy texts to find hundreds of passages showing their deity demands violence, and promoted bigotry. The disturbing part is you don't have to misinterpret passages, no need to change \"care for others\" into \"destroy those you hate.\" The Abrahamic religions push scripture and get followers by pushing for a bad epistemology. When their books have stories with God demanding genocide, promoting slavery, rape, misogyny and hatred, human sacrifice, etc. in very plain language it's hard to show that the religion doesn't promote horrible acts. It's just that they are all divinely justified that makes them not bad or evil. And the only defense is \"well you're just reading the Bible wrong.\" Ha!\n\nThe issue isn't that there are these horrible groups latching onto Christianity. It's that these groups are by definition Christian. They are following the letter of their scripture while other Christians say they are missing the spirit. The problem is all Christians say that about every denomination that isn't their own. All i need to do is show a Christians who is down on their luck some scripture that shows that \"others\" are bad, and that God agrees they are a source of evil. All that requires is me to point at the exact text in the Bible. As long as they can read the book does the rest.\n\nFurthermore, the \"good Christians\" aren't really that good. They still push a narrative of separation. They push the idea that sin exists and that people are deserving of punished for just being human. While you may want to cherry pick your way through the Bible and ignore the parts that are bad for your argument, you can't actually separate yourself from that text. Just because you believe God is all loving doesn't magically make the bad stories go away. God still murdered children based on their ethnicity. God still gave up virgin girls as sex slave for a war well fought. God still explained how to own people and beat them properly. That's great that you think God is love but the book that all Christians keep pushing seems to show you're wrong. How do good Christians reconcile the fact they are going against the Bible and that this is what God wants? How do they fight the fact that the evil parts are written in metaphor but in plain language.\n\nYou say Christians need to abandon these other groups. The only way to do that is to ditch Christianity all together. The religion didn't just magically appear. It was sculpted by those who were seeking power and justification for their acts. Not really much you can do to take that away from groups today who want to do the same.",

The harm factor plays in two situation: extreme duress and mental deficiencies. Those mental deficiencies show up as either physical abnormalities or retraining the brain due to external forces.\n\nHumans normally have empathy for others. One of the biggest external forces that dampens empathy seems to be religion. You're taught about these unjustified rules of how to live and that those who do not follow them are bad people. Starting at a young age, or when someone is in a bad situation looking for answers, it becomes easy to train them to push this exclusionary view to the point where empathy for them is nearly gone. But to not seem too sociopathic, they push ideas like \"hate the sin not the sinner\". When you talk to these people though, they very much show hatred to the sinners.",

But the religion is a human creation. It's a justification for the acts they already perform. The deity, like all others, are a personification of their own personal views. It gets worse when those views are then pushed on others so that they don't have any of their own.\n\n>The stories most refer to that include violence are just personal written accounts by non holy figure those are more of a historical record than rules to follow\n\nAgain demonstrably it true. God himself commits genocide on children, he demands the killing of multiple tribes to leaders throughout the Bible. He dictates how to own people and abuse them and his prophets all state that God wants wars and destruction over and over.\n\nI feel like you're not experiencing what the religion actually teaches.

Many of the people in this post who call themselves atheists are people I wouldn't want to associate with due to how I see you dismissing all christans as approving of child rape and the like. Painting groups with a broad brush is a dangerous thing to do. \n\nI know many decent people who are Republicans. They generally don't support Trump or any of the extreme right wing ideals we're seeing espoused by them.

The other difference is their leadership. The leadership defines what the organization stands for. There is nothing moral or good about the Republican organization or any major Christian organization. To willingly associate yourself with them is a clear statement that you agree and support their core beliefs. \n\n>\tI know many decent people who are Republicans.\n\nTo me that is an oxymoron. How can you be a decent person if you are against reproductive rights, democracy, general equality for all people, separation of church and state, etc etc etc. if they support the Republican Party as it stands now then they are not decent people. If they don\u2019t support it then why are they hitching their horse to that wagon?\n\nIf you don\u2019t agree with what the Nazis did and believe then why would you call yourself a Nazi?",

And that's pretty much the basis of Christianity. Believing in God and being christ-like. It's a slap in the face to actual Christians who try to follow the teachings of the Bible, because it requires a lot of effort to check yourself and not sway too far right or too far left. Imposter Christians don't want to do the introspective work that comes with being a Christian.  \n\nJust because Christians have done terrible things in the past, it doesn't mean you group it all into Christianity as a whole.

It didn't even matter that much to Christians for most of history, especially not the early ones (before it the religion institutionalized). Ex. [gnostics](https://www.gnosticdoctrine.com/2018/08/christ-pre-existed-but-jesus-didnt.html). The \"historicity\" quest is more modern, trying to respond to the burden of evidence.  If the historians tolerate a vague historical evidence requirement, then you'll find that *many Jesus existed*. Once you have a name floating around, it's easy to attribute a bunch of different stories and coalesce them into one.\n\nHere's a fun read: https://fadewblogs.blogspot.com/2021/08/why-Jesus-existance-doesnt-matter.html\n\nAnd for context: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_myth_theory\n\n\nIf you're feeling some doubts, you're in good company: https://merionwest.com/2022/01/14/jesus-mythicism-is-about-to-go-mainstream/ \n\nThe historical evidence relies on the weak standards historians have, since they really don't like \"dark ages\". They'll say that if serious standards applied, you wouldn't have stories like Pythagoras and various kings as being historical (they'd be myths, legends). Which would be fine, they're not fundamental parts of religions. (Most of these Jesus historians have been and are religious.)\n\nFor example, dealing with forgeries: https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Josephus#Passage_1:_the_.22Testimonium_Flavianum.22\n\nHere's a nice debate between scholars: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzjYmpwbHEA \n\nI don't get into it much now due to... collapse, but I see removing the influence of religion as part of removing the influence of capitalists and authoritarians. And as an environmental issue, as religions that promote dualism and \"immortal souls\" tend to treat actual life, material life, and the environment, as a doormat.",

I assume that people think it is the idea that Christians are by nature good, or perfect.\n\nHowever, what the Bible says is that all humans, including the Christian ones, are by nature evil. I think it goes even further sometimes by describing us as corrupt, foul, I don\u2019t know.\n\nNow, these \u201cfalse Christians\u201d, according to the \u201cNo True Scotsman\u201d claim, are being excluded improperly. I assume the interpretation is something along the lines of, \u201cThey\u2019re evil, so they\u2019re not like us.\u201d\n\nHowever, you must think of it from the Christian\u2019s point of view. The Bible teaches the Christian to love. However, the Bible also acknowledges the imperfection of humanity. So, Christians are going to be guilty of not acting in love.\n\nWhy are they still \u201cChristians\u201d even if they fail to act in love? This is because one of the fundamental requirements of Christianity is to acknowledge and be repentant of our sins.\n\nThe reason Christians claim that those who use biblical phrasing to encourage racism and sexism denounce those\u2019s Christianity is because those people are clearly not repentant. It is a sin they commit and recommit, with no sign of turmoil over it.\n\nIn addition, one must understand that anyone who has been raised with biblical teaching will be familiar with the fact that the Bible actually calls out the use of biblical phrasing for unbiblical things explicitly.",

You even admit that Christians use the Bible to justify it. There is no logical reason besides your own bias to exclude those teachings and resulting behavior from what Christianity is, and there is no reason to assume that the version you prefer, with the love and acceptance, is more legitimate than the version with the hate and bigotry, since both have textual support and and a long history of practice.

This is because the Bible defines Xianity, and the Bible tells us that hate is wrong and should not be done. This does not means that Xians do not do hate. They are humans, and no human is a perfect Xian. I suppose in that sense, there truly is \u201cNo True Scotsman\u201d, as there\u2019s \u201cNo True Xian.\u201d\n\nHowever, Xianity does not require you to be a perfect Xian to call yourself a Xian. It requires you to have faith in Jesus Christ and repent of your sins.\n\nJust like you aren\u2019t required to not put sugar in your porridge to be a Scotsman, even if you aren\u2019t a \u201cTrue\u201d one.\n\nXianity isn\u2019t just the \u201cversion I prefer\u201d, and there isn\u2019t textual support for both versions. Yes, the Bible\u2019s words can be taken out of context and misused by a manipulator to get people to do what they want, but so can the term \u201cgaslighting\u201d.\n\nGaslighters love to say that you\u2019re \u201cgaslighting\u201d them. Because they misuse the term does not make the term is theirs.\n\nSimilarly, because Christians misuse the Bible and even the title \u201cChristian\u201d, does not make it theirs.\n\nYes, Xianity has a history of Christians claiming to be Xian, hating, and oppressing.\n\nXians carry that weight, as we try to right the wrongs of those before us. We do not claim to be perfect, and we do not call Christians not Christians to absolve ourselves of blame.\n\nWe wish for the Church to be a standing marker of hope, love, and all of the fruits of the spirit, and so when we observe someone spewing hate and evil into the world unrepentant, what are we meant to do?\n\nCut them off.",

He was not described as a good guy, but is is 'quoted' condemning the rich and had no political party, he also condemned actions that are today very common among the religious clergy.\n\nHe was as racist and as religiously bigoted as any good Jew of his time and place.\n\nTry reading the description of the religion of the anti-christ found in revelation.\n\nThis idea that these ugly politicised power and money obsessed christians are the closest to real christians is a common idea among atheists that is dead wrong. It ain't so simple.\n\nLike the evangelicals belief that atheists can have no morals, this idea about the worst christians being to closest to 'real christians' is based on ignorance, on a lack of understanding of the issues involved.\n\nYou telling me to \"read the bible\" is as unintentionally humorous as christians telling me the same thing.\n\nLike them, I think you are getting your ideas from selected passages, not a study of the book.  You do not need to study the damned book but don't try to talk like you have.  A christian who has read it and made a real attempt to live it, will tear you apart.\n\nPersonally I don't believe there ever was a historical Jesus as described in the christian bible and I don't think it matters. Religious leaders will tell it and interpret it in ways that support their desire for money and control over the people in the pews, who will use it to justify abusing their children and hating their neighbours.  \n\nI'm not sure if anyone can honestly describe who the \"true\" christians are.",

Later, the illiterate King Charlemagne - the other guy that raped his way across the other end of Iron Age Europe (and who most of us who are not descended from Gengis Khan can trace our ancestry back to) chased the Muslims out, and ended the brief equality shared by Muslims, Jews, and Christians.\n\nThey also hid and coveted knowledge and hoarded science exploration to the extent of killing, excommunication, torture, and imprisonment of anyone who dared to spread knowledge that contradicted the Bible.\n\nSo\u2026 when you say these aren\u2019t \u201creal\u201d Christians, I say \u2018fuck you\u2019 as I take a fat dump on your holy book, while on the phone hiring a prostitute with a big plate of pork and shellfish in front of me, my other hand jerking me off, and repeating the name \u201cJehovah\u201d while grooming myself in front of a mirror.",

Because national churches have a monopoly, they basically have no drive to expand or recruit, they already won, which makes for less intense marketing. In the US, where churches are like private corporations, they compete to recruit and get followers ($$$$$), so they develop intense marketing and attractive experiences. Which is why the fascists will win there soon, as the \"moderate\" Christians are boring and lame -- that's the hollowing out of the center that's happening now.",

In the same way that extremists have increasingly gained power in the Republican Party, extremists have increasingly gained power in American Christianity. This trend can be reversed, but it will obviously be a very tough road that isn\u2019t guaranteed to be successful.\n\nThe question is how we try to get religion, Christianity, and conservatives into a better path, one that can co-exist in a healthy, multi-cultural democratic society. If we don\u2019t take this struggle head on with eyes open, we risk the American Taliban taking full power.\n\nThe image of bearded men with AKs looked more like what I was used to seeing in Afghanistan than any town USA. All too common now.\n\nI don\u2019t know the answer here, but I suspect it means working to empower non-extremist voices while disempowering the extremists through democratic reform and other means. However, it will ultimately require change from within, and Christian leaders who are willing to push for change. Right now those voices seem fairly lonely, just as the non-extremists within the GOP are increasingly isolated.",

The YMCA pushed this, do or die for your nation and your rewards will be in heaven. Kill in the military to spread the American perverted teachings of Rabbi Jesus. (While the rich make money hand over fist through blood) Here is what the Conservative Christian Movement and the White Supremacist have in common. It is called \"Muscular Christianity.  Here is the Wikipedia on another hold over of old British Wealthy Mentality.   [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular\\_Christianity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_Christianity)  This is a product of the Colonial Nation of England. Colonialism which the USA is now one, with it's evil White Supremacist War Economy.  I say this as both The British Empire and now the American Empire use's it's brute force to subdue nations of brown skinned peoples. So as to steal, rob and kill to gain their natural resources for making the rich, richer. At the expense of the Third World and it's own non-wealthy people. Fodder for the cannon thing.  Muscular Christianity is another example of the Ego of Men perverting the fiction of the Rabbi Jesus for gaining personal wealth.  A way to brain wash the citizens into killing for the rich because God deems them superior.  This is why women, even white women are told to subvert themselves to the man. Back to the wrong idea that women are nothing but for the man to 'plant his seed into'. She contributes no DNA to the baby.",
