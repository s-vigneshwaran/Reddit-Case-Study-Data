Becoming increasingly absent minded and probably cancer in the near future.

More people might be in therapy and it might be more acceptable to be gay or nonbinary or whatever, but if you think \"all generations have equal amounts of mental health issues\" you are just delusional. You think there are no differences between external social factors in generations? That there is just no difference between being a teenager now, in 2000, 1980, 1960, etc?\n\n'The rate of suicide among young people aged 10 to 24 increased nearly 60% between 2007 and 2018, according to a new CDC report.'\n\nI bet it's gotten much worse now with the pandemic. You think the reason tons of women are popping antidepressants like candy is because we're now more accepting of mental health? You don't think there is an ongoing, growing problem of dating apps turning tons of average men into incels, teenagers seeing others on social media fake being happy so they try desperately to get attention through making a popular tiktok or whatever, etc.?  I'm pretty sure there are multiple analyses on social media ruining teenagers' health. Kids being raised with tablets instead of parents teaching them. Rapidly growing childhood obesity rates in the past 20 years that most certainly will lead to poor mental and physical health. So on and so on. I'm sure some zoomers are based and ignore this nonsense but not most.\n\nWhat an awful take. The only thing I can say in favor of the zoomers' mental health is that it's probably better than the upcoming generation's will be.",
