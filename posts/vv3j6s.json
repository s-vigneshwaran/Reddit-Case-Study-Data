They're expecting teachers to teach a \"history is written by the victors, so if course the losers look bad\" stance, and some teachers definitely will. They'll also allow for real history teachers to teach the history of the Holocaust and then (before being forced to move on to other topics leaving the Holocaust as a vague horror committed in the pursuit of evil) teach the lies and propaganda that convinced the public to condone or participate in the Holocaust.\n\nIf I was a history teacher in Ohio I'd be thinking about how being forced to teach Nazi ideology doesn't mean having to teach their premises as being true. Have to teach the class about the \"stab in the back\" myth? Teach the full history that exposes the lie the myth is based on.",

While the Wehrmacht participated in the Holocaust too, becoming SS, camp guards, or part of the Einsatzgruppen, was by and large voluntary.\n\nThere is a major difference between \"a majority of the population supported Hitler to varying extents\" and \"being an active member of groups who perpetrated the Holocaust\".",

He even named his attempt to steal the election after Mein Kampf. \n\nDemocrats accused him of using Hitler's Big Lie technique when he lied about the election, it also is a pretty strong fit for how Trump calls anything negative towards him \"fake news.\" \n\nThen this happened. \n\n\"AP News: Whose \u2018Big Lie\u2019? Trump\u2019s proclamation a new GOP litmus test\"\n\n\"There is no evidence to support Trump\u2019s allegations of mass voter fraud, and numerous audits, Republican state election officials and Trump\u2019s own attorney general have said the election was fair.\n\nBut Trump has stuck to his story and issued a \u201cproclamation\u201d Monday attempting to co-opt the language his foes use to brand his falsehoods.\n\n\u201cThe Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!\u201d he wrote.\n\nCheney, who has not ruled out a 2024 run herself, fired back.\n\u201cThe 2020 presidential election was not stolen. Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE, turning their back on the rule of law, and poisoning our democratic system,\u201d she tweeted.\nClearly she has no intention of scaling back her criticism, even as she faces the possibility of losing her leadership post.\"\n\nHitler had claimed that Jews were telling a \"Big Lie\" that nationalist general Erich Ludendorff was to blame for Germany's loss in WWI. \n\nHistorian Timothy Snyder observed: \n\n\"The lie is so big that it reorders the world. And so part of telling the big lie is that you immediately say it's the other side that tells the big lie. Sadly, but it's just a matter of record, all of that is in\u00a0Mein Kampf.\"\n\nAnd lastly,\n\n\"All this was inspired by the principle\u00a0\u2013 which is quite true within itself\u00a0\u2013 that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility; because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily; and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie, since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large-scale falsehoods.\n\nIt would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths, and they would not believe others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously. Even though the facts which prove this to be so may be brought clearly to their minds, they will still doubt and waver and will continue to think there may be some other explanation. For the grossly impudent lie always leaves traces behind it, even after it has been nailed down, a fact which is known to all expert liars in this world and to all who conspire together in the art of lying.\"\n\n\u2014\u2009Adolf Hitler,\u00a0Mein Kampf, vol.

If \"teaching\" includes \"teaching about\" -- like when you say \"I teach American History\" -- then discussion of these topics is forbidden.\n\n\n- The first divisive concept is that \"one nationality [etc.] is inherently superior to another nationality [etc.]\" It would be nearly impossible to discuss the Holocaust without discussing its key justification -- that Aryans are inherently superior to other races -- which is a divisive concept.\n\n\n- The bill tries to get around this by explicitly permitting \"impartial discussion of controversial aspects of history\" and \"impartial discussion on ... historical oppression.\"\n\n\n- The phrase \"impartial discussion\" is what the OP tweet is getting at. \"Impartial discussion\" usually means teaching \"both sides.\" It would be immoral to have an \"impartial discussion\" of the Holocaust or really any historical tragedy motivated by racism, because empathy forces us to be partial.\n\n\nThat said, this all relies on a really uncharitable reading of the bill. I don't think it will actually be used to prevent teaching that genocide is bad. However, it definitely _will_ be used to prevent people from teaching about structural racism, because the existence of structural racism, at least on a national level, is explicitly listed as a divisive concept. That's not as bad as \"both sides-ing the Holocaust,\" but it is still a disservice to students. Students deserve to know about our nation's lasting problems so that they're better equipped to fix them.",

Idk if stormfront was archived, I believe it was taken down but if it still exists to view in some form just go look. It's all there. Neo-Nazis and modern Republicans deny the holocaust happened or at least portend that it wasn't as bad as history says. It's revisionism. Just like those who claim that the movement wasn't founded in Christianity. Or that it was a false flag perpetrated by the Jews, or that the Jews had every chance to leave before it began. The \"other side\" is Nazi apologists and sympathizers. They'll whine that \"well history was written by the victors, the Nazis were not bad at all\" while simultaneously plugging Tucker Carlson's replacement theory. We need to start charging the new ones just like we charged the old ones. Nip those little pussy crybabies in the bud. There was an American Nazi Party at the time, their catchphrase you ask? America First. And the big bad wolf ate up all the Jewish children, ripped them limb from limb, burned them with caustic chemical concoctions, starved, beat, tortured and killed their parents before their very eyes before raping and beating those same children...but that was fine, because it's not OUR kids. Now they want it to be our kids. Read your history people, the brown shorts are here and as cowardly as they are, they will only be put down by equal violence. I have no less than five mother fuckers throw shit at my young children, one old bat who stopped, got out of their car and told them my wife and we're planning to murder them, all because I have a real basic Pro-Roe sign in my yard. I'm buying a gun, the next one who accosts my children, throws shit at them, screams at them, will never do so again. My framing hammer has been enough to chase them off so far, but next time it will be a warning shot, one warning shot. Y'all creepy fucking right wingers coming onto my property trying to do whatever creepy shit to my kids is a step too far. Warn your grandparents because it's all geriatric fucks.",
