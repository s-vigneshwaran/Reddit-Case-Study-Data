The frustration I feel explaining normal human interactions is exhausting,  yet satisfying. You see, a chimp claps when you give him a banana,a chimp will also clap of you call them a big dumb bitch while given them a banana. He doesn't care what you said or what you meant,  he just likes...banana. \"Banana\" of course is \"thoughts and prayers\". But Anon, since I'm clearly frustrated you don't get to decide if it's justified. In my mind I'm am justified all the while being appropriate and conveying my words like an adult.

Then again, Mueller covered up the BCCI bank shit (cia money laundering, they got cash for operations from there) by saying \"national security\" over and over again. https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1991/08/11/the-cias-bcci-laundry/6c69ffbf-42d3-46ee-ba86-b8ad03adb685/\n\n4) nobody in power/congress got punished for Jan 6, charlie Kirk personally helped finance for 60 buses of people to show up, the house hasn't used its congressional arresting powers or jail since the 1960s \n\n5) despite the FBI having extensive knowledge about and during Jan 6, along with numerous plainclothes agents among the 5,000 that were outside the capitol building, nobody stopped anybody from going in, and nobody in the FBI killed anyone. Had the mob attacked an FBI building, I'm guessing they would've brought out everything and made the Las Vegas massacre look trivial. Then again, this is the same FBI that only killed one during the 2016 Bundy occupation of the wildlife reserve and none during the 2014 Bundy standoff.",

It includes accidental gun/hunting insurance for like 10k if you died hunting or shooting. Smh. \n\nThey get people in real young this way. It wasn\u2019t until the whole Russian dark money funneling to American campaigns thing That I realized what an issue they actually are. They tell you to teach your kids young. It starts forming a gun centric identity. \n\nI don\u2019t actually see a problem with learning early on. The first time i went shooting I was about 4 years old. My dad gave me a 30-06 with the instructions, \u201cline the cans up on those lines in the scope.\u201d That was it, nothing else. I tucked the stock under my arm, put the scope right to my eye, found the cans, tried to get each can to line up on one of those windage lines in the scope lmao. Pulled the trigger, scope gave me a black eye and I was knocked on my ass. My dad laughed. **BUT** I knew the guns weren\u2019t toys after that and I didn\u2019t play with them. I got ken when I was about 7 but was very irresponsible with it. \n\nMy neighbor on the other hand, didn\u2019t teach his kids about guns, and one found his, and shot his little brother. I don\u2019t remember their ages but I think it was about 7-5 so\u2026 Imo, people are more likely to shoot themselves than ever need one for defense.  I\u2019m not anti gun, but I am a realist about them, you\u2019ll never \u201cneed\u201d one, but that doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t be allowed to have them. They need to raise the bar for who can get them, and then figure out a way to buy 100s of millions of them back that would be successful. Idk.",

As an example, I'd much rather communicate with someone who doesn't pick up on sarcasm than someone who's a bad listener and doesn't pay enough attention to follow the logic of what I'm saying.\n\nI'm also inclined to believe that regularly using sarcasm that doesn't land as expected is a stronger indicator of bad communication than just not understanding sarcasm to begin with. It's basically sending an encrypted message the receiving end can't decrypt.\n\nSigned, someone who eventually learned there are usually more effective modes of communication than snark and sarcasm.\n\nP.S.

Detecting sarcasm is unrelated to a bunch of other communication skills, just like color blindness is unrelated to a bunch of other aspects of vision (as far as I know, anyway; maybe the cause of colorblindness also leads to other issues I'm unaware of).\n\nAs such, not understanding sarcasm says nothing about how good of a listener you are, just like colorblindness says nothing about your long-distance vision (with the same caveat as above re: my ignorance of color blindness), and someone who doesn't pick up on sarcasm can still be a better-than-average listener in contexts where they don't need to detect hidden meanings.\n\n>Snark is not the same and to conflate them is like conflating speech with an insult, snark is a rude subset of sarcasm.\n\nSorry if I muddied the waters by including my history of being needlessly snarky at the end of my comment.

A kind of \"see, I think this idea is so absurd I'm obviously not sincerely agreeing with it even though I'm expressing agreement if you take me literally.\"\n\nAs such, I think it says more about someone's social skills than it does about their communication skills.\n\nFurthermore, the \"inherently makes you a worse communicator\" depends entirely on who you're comparing. If you're saying someone who doesn't understand sarcasm is inherently worse at communicating than someone who does understand it and otherwise has the same set of communication skills, then it's an outright tautology that doesn't say anything useful about how significant sarcasm is to communication - just that it is significant at all, which I think everyone already agrees with.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you're saying people in general who don't understand sarcasm are worse at communicating than those who do, I'd say that's almost entirely down to the important communication skills, and that these people's understanding of sarcasm is practically never going to be a deciding factor.\n\n> Like a car with one tyre that doesn't work great.\n\nI feel like the tyre analogy greatly exaggerates how important sarcasm is to effective communication. Unlike tyres on a car, there's plenty of human communication where sarcasm is not only unnecessary but outright undesirable even when everyone involved is expected to understand it. The state of your tyres, on the other hand, matters whenever you're using the car for its intended purpose.\n\nIf we want to stick with a car analogy, I think trunk space might be more fitting (though still way overstating the importance of sarcasm imo). The trunk space doesn't matter at all for a car's core purpose of moving people from place to place, but it greatly enhances the secondary function of moving other stuff along with the people. Similarly, sarcasm usually allows us to pack a message with a bunch of extra information about ourselves and our attitude toward the subject matter, even though we could easily express the core meaning in a non-sarcastic manner.",

One of the more famous theories of evil is Hannah Arendt's Banality of Evil, that monstrous deeds (Adolf Eichmann's holocaust) are done by people with 0 relation to it, 0 thoughts about and 0 concern about it. It's not necessarily malice or some great evil will, just absentmindedness, as if people were in the habit of doing evil without realizing it.\n\nShe argued that this sort of evil was connected to thinking because thinking is to have a dialogue with yourself, and when you have a dialogue with yourself you put yourself to a standard like you would a stranger. And if you have a standard some deeds, assuming you're not a monster, will disgust and through such disgust your actions become something else than just banal habit.",

If you're using instrumental thinking then you can just use utilitarianism and arrive at the conclusion that, yes, exerminating x million people will result in a net benefit of happiness.\n\nArendt herself even observes that the ones who were the most able to resist the Nazi worldview were those who saw thinking as end in itself, while those who saw thinking as a mean quickly succumbed",

While \u00absolitude\u00bb and \u00abdistance from the world\u00bb are used in the article you have linked, this seems to be a figurative and not a litteral use of those terms. In other words your perspective of the world must be more abstract and distant for it to quality as propper thought. The act of being alone is foundational for such thought, but there is no reason to suppose that it cannot be done elswhere. In fact \u00abArendt forever remains suspicious of a thinking that has its place fully outside the world\u00bb. This tells me that ther is more to this than simply being alone. Ther is a connection to the world that must be maintained. The truely interesting part of this article is that parts contrasting loneliness to solitude. I can see why you might think this nessecitates as Arendts seems to categorize the feeling of loneliness as what you feel when you are with people that you don\u2019t fit in with or cannot connect to. It is the feeling you feel when you feel sepparated from other people. It is the feeling of being isolated. Which is interesting and  no doubt true. Solitude however is defined as being alone with your thoughts. The way I read it is that the act of thinking itself IS solitude. Being alone helps and is sertainly a good foundatin for thought, but Solitude is \u00abthe convesation with yourself\u00bb then you can \u00abbe alone with yourself\u00ab simply by not engaging the people you are in physical proximity with. The baseline for though seems to be more the abillity to be comfortable being alone in your head rather that physical limmitations. At least that is the impression I\u2019m getting from the article you have linked. In short you are being litteral where some of these seem to be more figurative. For example if you are comfortable with your companion and with yourself then you have no issue sitting in companionable silence. Each thinking, or reading, or writing, or perhaps doing some other urelated task. However, if you are uncomfortable you seek to fill that silence with something. To distract yourself from your thoughts, because you dont like your thoughts. Then it is in deed nessacery to be alone and free from dostractions, but that is only when you aren\u2019t in the habbit of thinking in the first place and need to be placed in a situation where you must. If you are comfortable thinking, you could probably do it annywhere. So basically I\u2019m quastioning your interpretation of this article.",

Loneliness is the state of being where you don't even have yourself to speak with, it's the reality of being in a mass, of always having people near you who have nothing to contribute to. This was put out in her very first major work (Origins) and you really shouldn't try to give a critique if you don't know this distinction and how mass loneliness relates to totalitarianism and evil.\n\n>\u00abArendt forever remains suspicious of a thinking that has its place fully outside the world\u00bb.

I had an impression of such a thing from you because of one very simple thing. You have failed to explain what your definition of \u00abthinking\u00bb is. You can\u2019t have a propper intellectual discussion about something without defining your own definitions. Professor Bernt Hagtvet points out for example that there is a lot of dissagreement in the interpretations of her work because of her extencive use of irony, sarcasm and use of poetic language. This leads to a lot of incomplete understanding about her work. This would fit well in with the fact that you seem to be taking Arendt\u2019s words compleatly litteraly while I am reading them more figuratively. Hagtvet further points out the two different meanings of the word \u00abthougtless\u00bb. What is a thoughtless action? Is it the act of simply not considdering the position of the person you are impacting with your action. That you don\u2019t take into account their thoughts and feelings. Maybe you don\u2019t care about them at all, it is simply a bad action on your part. The second definition is it the idea that you simply haven\u2019t thought about what you are doing at all. That you act not based on your own thoughts or feelings, but out of someone elses. that your actions are not driven my any thought at all. Which of these is it? Because there is a destinct difference between the two. This is a limitation of her English claims Hagtvet, and again this leads to a misunderstanding of her work, and different interpretations resulting from that. So I ask again: What makes you think that your interpretation of her work is the correct one?\n\nAs for the distinction between lonlieness and solitude. Yes I picked up on the fact that she made a distinction. I commented on it.\n\n>Arendts seems to categorize the feeling of loneliness as what you feel when you are with people that you don\u2019t fit in with or cannot connect to. It is the feeling you feel when you feel sepparated from other people. It is the feeling of being isolated. Which is interesting and no doubt true.\n\nI therefor don\u2019t see why you insist uppon further explaining it. Really you just gave me my own words back at me with a slightly different formulation. regradless it is my interretation of what Arendt means by solitude that we should be discussing and where our interpretations differ wildly. You seem to think that solitude is entierly physical. I am arguing that it isn\u2019t. Being alone doesn\u2019t mean fore example that there aren\u2019t other people physically present. I\u2019m sitting alone on the buss even though there thechnically is a crowd of people around me after all. It is the poetic definition of being alone. Solitude is therefor being confortable being alone, or rather being fomfortable bein by one\u2019s self. In the abstract sense I am arguing that mulitple peole can be \u00abby them selves\u00bb together in the same space. For example at a library, or even at home with members of their family each doing separate things. One can even argue that Alone can mean not pert of a spesiffic group. An unafilliated party who is still a member of a larger whole. This last I will dismiss as Arendt does seem to make a distinction between the public and private. Though again that definition is a bit fuzzy in the article you provided.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You can be in solitude in meditation, i.e, not thinking\n\nThis is what you wrote about solitude and thinking, and it doesn\u2019t really explain much. If you think I\u2019m wrong then you need to explain not state. What my argument was war related to the definition given in the paper that you yourself linked.\n\n>Arendt distinguishes solitude\u2014 the converstation one has with oneslef\u2014 from lonlieness\u2014 the experience of absence of being with others.\n\nIt goes on to state that we cannot experience solitude in a public setting, but here again we get into the difference between the public and the private. You can surely be in private with other people. I mean if sex is something that you do in private then you don\u2019t need to be physically alone to have privacy, since I believe that you need at least one other person in order to have sex.\n\nAccording to the article Arendt writes about Karl Jespers and his \u00abinternal exile\u00bb. He is alone, yet one of many citizens. What makes him alone then if he is not the only one physically there? Both this focus and the and the paragraph over about the private setting, both contribute to the impression I get that solitude is a state of being rather than purely a physical one existence.\n\nI am given the impression that solitude is simply existing comfortably in one\u2019s own company, and that doesn\u2019t seem to nessecitate being physicaly alone to achieve. Meditation can achieve solitude I\u2019m sure, but the same laws should apply to it as to thinking shouldn\u2019t it. When meditating you block out the rest of the world to senter yourself and empty your head, why can you then not block out the rest of the world to retreat into your private thoughts to think there? To seek solitude in your own thoughts in order to think must surely be an action you can take if you have first learned to think in the first place, which further leads me to conclude that thinking is an act of solitude. One you can seek at will once learned. Now I agree that being continuously engaged with actions and speach will disengage you from this exercise, but just being in the same room with someone doesn\u2019t mean you need to interact with them.\n\nFurter more the distinction between reasoning and thinking is interesting, and is perhaps something that you could have brought into this discussion yourself to try to clear up the convesation at hand. However the explanation in the text about how reasoning is supposed to represent the rational justification for why someone believes what they believe as opposed to thinking being more about the natural flow of ideas and reaching your own conlcusion through these means(or at least that\u2019s what I suppose since \u00abThinking\u00bb really isn\u2019t well defined at all, nor have you defined it for us), doesn\u2019t explain well to me how there is a separation between internal and external dialogue. There must be one if spoken dialogue somehow prevents thought. Reason can surely be done equaly well within our own heads so that isn\u2019t all of it. Is it the slowing down of though or the imperfect communication that words offer prevents it? Or is it the taking up of a particular positions that stints this discourse for being thought? Why can not two people in a private setting sharing their thoughts about something without taking up a definitive position not be an example of thought? This are things I wanted you to answer, but have not. You have sated it isnt, but have not made a case for why yourself.\n\n>Don't mistake thoughts for thinking.\n\nDon\u2019t just make statements like this. Explain.\n\nAs for the socratic ethic point of view about how you have to live with yourself, I havent stated anything in opposition. In fact my statement that people fill the silence \u00abTo distract yourself from your thoughts, because you dont like your thoughts.\u00bb is pretty much exaclty it isn\u2019t it. The idea of running away from yourself. It\u2019s really not nessacery to point me towards things I got to on my own. It just comess off like you lack reading comprehention, which is kinda something in my favour here. Especially when you ignored this part of my statement (which again states the same thing) in favour of correcting the use of a single word used in it.\n\n>The baseline for though seems to be more the abillity to be comfortable being alone in your head rather that physical limmitations\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for whether or not I should critique something based on the evidence presented to me by you, well that\u2019s what critical thinking is isn\u2019t it? That you have provided incomplete information isn\u2019t really my problem is it? I can still use what I know to think about whether or not what you say makes sense. So far it doesn\u2019t. It\u2018s you I\u2019m critiquing not Arendt after all here. It\u2019s your interpretation and presentation of Arendt\u2019s work that sounds odd after all.",

                          "text": "Alright. Response in good faith:\n\n>Can you clarify for me what the terms for this contract are?\n\nTo quote part of the original source of the \"Tolerance is a contract\" that I myself did not write:\n\n\"Blind adherence to tolerance in the name of tolerance does nothing to ensure the civil liberties of the marginalized; it does the exact opposite by tolerating those who refuse to agree to the social contract and seek to harm others. [...] Instead, tolerance occurs when different groups decide to prioritize cooperation and mutual compassion over pure self interest and bigotry. No sane person would consider those that act on the latter worthy of tolerance as they have broken the bargain.\"\n\nIt is a social contract and isn't literally defined. \n\n>Are you saying that intolerance should be met with intolerance\n\nLess \"eye for an eye\" and more \"tit for tat\". Intolerance is met with dismissal but cooperation is met in kind. Growth is acknowledged from those that put in the effort to do and be better, even if they were not so previously.\n\n>Are you saying that people who are intolerant deserve to be dismissed as mindless automatons\n\nI'm not really defending their comment so much as I am expanding on the nature of tolerance. I do think dismissing the ignorant is sometimes required to progress, since they refuse to cooperate and demand our tolerance when doing so breaks the contract.\n\n>How do you know that this contract (whatever is terms may be) is being broken \"at will?\"\n\nIt is at the higher level. Those spreading the propaganda (NRA, GOP, etc) are willful, those believing it may not be as much so, but are still either culpable or at least in violation.\n\n>If you believe it requires a higher level of critical thinking, then how do you justify the dehumanization of people who do not meet that criteria due to their limited educational opportunities?\n\nThis is also a violation of the contract. Dehumanization is an intolerance, although I do not believe that \"everyone can be saved\" as there are many who choose ignorance and cannot free themselves unless they choose otherwise, no matter how much we try to hold their hand - and as such there are some people that I simply must accept will be 'naturally selected' or similarly dragged kicking and screaming into a better future.",

Sometimes you simply aren\u2019t equipped to untangle them, and ultimately, you are not obligated to. However I do believe that you should not assume that it will end up that way. There should at least be an attempt at understanding.\n\nThis is where I somewhat disagree with the \u201cnot everyone can be saved\u201d. It\u2019s not that they went past a point of no return, but that the circumstances to get them to open back up are so complex that most people won\u2019t be able to get through. But if anything that\u2019s exactly WHY these attempts of understanding need to be made: you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be the one person who could get through to them. If you aren\u2019t, you can leave it to someone else, but if you spread the message that it isn\u2019t even worth trying, there may not BE a someone else.\n\nWhen it comes to the internet and strangers though, yeah it\u2019s not gonna work most of the time. If you don\u2019t know them at all it\u2019s not gonna be effective compared to someone who\u2019s actually from their life. But this reason is why I get concerned when, on the internet, someone asks what they should do about their friend being bigoted or intolerant etc. and the top responses are things like \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a friend. Cut contract immediately.\u201d I get it if the person cutting contract is being harmed mentally - no one should be forced to \u201chelp\u201d someone who is actively hurting them - but otherwise, they are in a unique position to try and pull their friend out, and we should try to equip them with the perspectives they need to succeed in that.",

Some racism, sexism, and similar bigotry can be addressed, but frequently is only able to be done when those in direct connection to the intolerant force them to - such as if a staunchly religious republican's child comes out as gay. This is also an issue with the people in power who prevent other such methods from having success - education and the like.\n\nHowever sometimes (perhaps more often than not) the personal solution just as easily causes the opposite result - the intolerant can just double down harder and cause intense damage to others despite their innocence. There is no tolerance for this and no expectation of ability to save.\n\nIt's important to establish critical thinking in the contract, because knowing the difference is difficult at best and frequently impossible without context but is exposed to the entire world to see.",

I'm dead certain that the majority of those who clapped were one of the following:  not paying any attention; on his side; nervously clapping to relieve the tension; or clapping sarcastically to show they didn't give a shit about what he said and would not be left in a stunned silenced. \n\nthanks",

The response to mindless trolling is annoyance, but the response to well-done parody is pause: \"wait, is he serious? Wait, uh....\"\n\nIt's the South Park formula (which itself, IIRC, is based on like an old Greek play formula): take a premise that you want to parody, crank up that premise to 11, and if done right, you've effectively highlighted the ridiculousness of the original premise.\n\nHere, the premise is that \"thoughts and prayers are enough.\" He cranks it up by taking the mic and claiming that thoughts and prayers are more than enough and that its the community's failure - not Wayne's - because the community hasn't been thinking and praying and praying and thinking enough. By zeroing in on this idea and making the community feel like they're liable to some of the blame (by not praying enough), he _should_ give them pause. They should think, \"woah wait up, it's not my fault. It's not like thoughts and prayers actually do- um...wait...\" And boom, parody successful.\n\nIt seems like some of them are too stupid to understand what's happening though...sigh. They're like mindless NPCs.",

You say you never donate or help the NRA in any way, but here you are encouraging people to donate to 2A advocacy groups (without specifying not to donate to the NRA) and passionately arguing for them to vote in favor of gun rights at the state and federal level:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/liberalgunowners/comments/hmzukc/it_is_the_duty_of_former_antigunners_to_stand_up/fx8li0k/\n\n>I'm fairly certain you've read my opinion on mass shootings and what should be done about the issue and I'll leave it at that.\n\nI'm fairly certain that you're avoiding the question because you and I both know the answer. And it takes me back to the point I made - saying fuck the NRA does absolutely nothing if you vote in Republicans at any level. You are doing what the NRA wants, and they could give a shit if you say mean things about them.",

You are comparing countries with little to no access to guns to a country where guns are readily available. The most accurate comparison you can get is by school massacres where the comparison is devoid of the tools used to commit the crime. My premise is that there is zero chance that the gun owners will budge on this because it is painfully clear it is a gun grab so look for alternative ways to stop school massacres regardless of what tools people are using. All of you who are supporting more gun control are pushing for a false dichotomy where its either you give up your gun rights or more children are going to die because yall are are not going to talk about any other solutions.",

I haven't seen proof that this was pre planned long before his 18th birthday but let's say you raise it to 21. He still wanted to kill people and he still can congratulations you just played yourself. Litterally your argument only lead to but he wouldn't have a gun not but the kids are safe.\n\nLol yea other countries banned guns no shit they don't have shootings. That's like going to Amsterdam and asking why no one is being arrested for smoking weed.\n\nThey are legal gun purchases, then went through the proper procedures; background check and all. What other restrictions are you even proposing that would've saved these children's lives?\n\nLol funny thing is they are trying to ban body armor too in new york so you can't even send your kids to school with body armor just in case something like this happens. I don't understand why do you not want more security at schools? Are you saying to ban guns and keep the current security which have been proven over and over again to be in adequate? Do you even actually care about the children? Because if you did you would be looking for solutions that would stop these incidents from happening regardless of what tools they use. The fact that you're using these children's death to push more gun control is sickening because you wouldn't even look at the solutions that would most likely stop all massacres which is to beef up security regardless of the tools used. You disgusting human filth, litterally up there with BETO.",

This is the funny thing, you're so rooted in American gun culture you don't even understand how fucked up and how low America has sunk.

You've completely lost the plot, now you just regurgitate the garbage those bought and paid republicans feed you without a single critical thought. It's too abstract for you to imagine a society where there's no need for active shooter drills and the school's don't have to be a fortress, it just breaks your right wing brain. \n\nTake care bud, I truly feel sorry for people like you and the type of society you're advocating",

Permit is granted on a maybe basis. If children uses stick without permit in defensive use they still go to prison. Because some child beat another child with a stick.\n\n you also forgot to include the role of the government.

There have been 26 noted attacks at schools there over the past 5 years, the majority of them without any fatalities. Why is this the case, do you ask? Because China is a dictatorship? Because there is more social control? Nah, I think the main answer is that NOT EVERY FREAKING INDIVIDUAL CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON A SEMI/FULLY AUTOMATIC RIFLE WITH 30+ ROUND DRUM MAGAZINES AND BUMPER STOCKS (not to speak of ANY OTHER GUN IN EXISTENCE).\n\nYou are delusional for thinking that selling these high power rifles to anyone 18+ without any background checks, training, licenses that actually matter or are checked regularly. I truly, honestly hope you are trolling, otherwise I weep for you and your backwards, un-democratic nation, my friend.",

There had been one mass shooting with bump stocks and that was las vegas, not even a school shooting. Nice false flag kinda like those suppressed muskets lol.\n\nWhat world do you live in? All firearm sales by licensed dealers requires a background check in the US. Oh wait you don't have any idea what the gun laws and procedures are to acquire a firearm how typical.\n\nAlso if you'll recall I claimed china has plenty of school massacres which they do.\n\nAlso there are more factors that play into why there are less massacres in China for you to attribute only the aspect that suits you is rather halirous. The most important in my opinion is they typical have walls surrounding the school and have a gate guards so ill tended people tend not to get in.",

And please do look up the number of fatalities during these incidents - in the US they are many times higher than the average in China.\n\nWhy? Why would that be?\n\nOh wait. We know. Guns.\n\nOf course this is not the only argument (as I mentioned, the social control of Chinese culture is far higher than in the US, amongst other things), but it is the most frank and obvious difference between both nations in this regard. \n\nAnd if your argument is differentiating between different types of mass shootings using different types of weapons, you are even more f'ed up than I thought lol. The 18 year old killing 21 peeps last week had an AR-15. Two of them, in fact. Bought without any parental supervision, without any check-ups, nothing. And you're saying that this is not a mass killing weapon, and that there is not something inherently wrong with a system where some psychopatic kid can buy murder weapons three years before buying a fucking beer? Grow up.\n\nAnd your last argument is that Chinese schools have guards and walls? Dude... Have you ever even been to China? Have you ever been to any of those schools? You are mental, your arguments are filled with falsehoods, you are cherry picking points of context whilst ignoring all others to suit your own narrative...

You guys don't want to address the issue and just going after guns as if its the guns causing people to shoot up schools. Every alternative presented be it arm teachers, hire armed security, ETC have been ignored you all just want more gun control. If you all just want more gun control stop using the dead kids as an excuse and just outright say it. By not considering other options you all are literally making this a either my way or the high way situation which someone else was crying about how its supposedly the pro gun rights people making this hard. Pro gun rights people are saying I wouldn't give you what you want but lets try alternatives but you gun grabbers are like no its either our way or kids are going to keep dying.

We\u2019re the only country with this particular problem. How complicated is it to literally do what the sane, better countries have done? How would we ARM teachers when we don\u2019t even trust them not to indoctrinate kids into liberal left-wing agendas? Not to mention\u2014 the problem in the Texas shooting wasn\u2019t that there weren\u2019t \u201cgood guys with guns\u201d on the scene. There were actually lots. They had armed security. They had emergency procedures and they had a recent SWAT walkthrough in case such a scenario unfolded\u2026. \n\nThe problem was that there was a bad guy with a machine that lets an average person murder incredibly efficiently, with little to no training. So he slaughtered 19 people. 17 little children and two of their teachers. \n\nShootings of this nature and scope happen regularly in the United States and only in the United States. Other countries don\u2019t let their 18 yo bad guys get those. We shouldn\u2019t either. Why the hell are you not for proven solutions?",

It fits the norm there. So it\u2019s not reported as mass shootings.\n\nEngland has less guns with them.  Only organized crime can gain easy access to guns. This means the criminals get guns. And the innocent civilians don\u2019t. At the same time. Though Gun crime has technically gone down. Regular violence still follows its normal highs and lows. Guns don\u2019t magically make people want to murder others. People have reasons for going out and murdering someone.

      "text": "GUN RESPONSIBILITY LEADS TO GUN SAFETY\nA Common-Sense Approach to Second Amendment Issues.  \u00a9\n     With the increasing massacres, gun-related deaths, and heartbreaking reports of children with guns, (up to 8 child incidents per day in the US), almost everyone can agree there are too many guns in our society. The death toll is rising along with the number of guns. Mindful of the Las Vegas Massacre in which almost 1,200 rounds were fired, mostly into the crowd, by a single shooter in a very few minutes, it\u2019s time to fully grasp that guns are primarily designed to kill or maim people and animals. Since their basic nature is lethal, society is fully justified in requiring firearm protections to ensure public safety. \n     There is no need or justification to repeal the 2nd Amendment enshrined in our Constitution, it was put there to safeguard freedoms\u2026 and freedom\u2019s obligations. The way to address 2nd Amendment issues is to legislate responsible, well-regulated gun ownership as the 2nd Amendment clearly states. \n1.\t  Responsibility of Gun Ownership\n     As a deadly weapon, every gun must have an owner who is legally responsible for it.\nAn unregistered gun is a threat to civilized society because no one is legally responsible. Guns are dangerous. If no one is willing to accept the responsibility for a gun, it should be destroyed. \n\n2.\t Licensing, Registration, and Background Checks\n    Every gun and its owner must be Licensed and Registered and all gun owners must pass a Background Check.\nThis is how society can identify and regulate who is responsible for a gun. Society mandates the same three basic requirements for motor vehicles, despite their primary purpose being simply transportation. \n\n3.\tInsure All Firearms\n    If you drive a car, you are expected to have liability insurance. It is your responsibility.\nLike driving, gun responsibility requires gun owners\u2019 insurance so that victims or anyone else involved can be suitably compensated. Society must not bear the predictable costs when individuals claim gun ownership rights without accepting gun ownership responsibilities. \n    Who currently pays to clean up a murder, suicide, or mass shooting? Incredibly, these costs are paid by taxpayers and victims.\n\n4.\tThe gun owner is liable for their gun \n     No matter what happens with a gun, if the registered owner fails to secure it, the owner is both responsible and liable.\nGuns don\u2019t kill people, they are just efficient tools. People kill people. Guns cannot be held liable, therefore \u2018accidents\u2019 cannot be blamed on guns as they often are now. Gun responsibility requires guns to be kept securely, so they can\u2019t fall into the wrong hands.  \n     As a deadly weapon, guns cannot be \u2018accidentally\u2019 pointed at anyone. If anyone is wounded or killed by a gun being cleaned, handled, or dropped, the gun owner is responsible and liable.   \n    Killing unnecessarily is horrible. The shooting of a child, or by a child, is the worst crime imaginable and must be treated as such. If a child has access to a gun, the gun owner is liable for what happens next. If a child or anyone else is \u2018accidentally\u2019 killed or wounded, the gun owner must, at a minimum, be charged with some degree of Murder. If a child has access to a gun, the crime is recognized by law as depraved indifference to the consequences of not securing the gun, and the gun owner is charged accordingly. Any of the above crimes cannot legally be the fault of a child or a gun. Accidental discharge cannot be considered a defense.\n\n\n\n5.\tDo Not Threaten Your Neighbor With a Firearm    \n     Civilian concealed carry is sometimes necessary for self-defense, but a concealed gun does not imply a threat to anyone unless openly displayed. \nPublic, civilian open-carry (in a non-hunting or target practice setting) is an implicit threat to your neighbor, a bully\u2019s intimidation tactic. Open-carry put in basic terms demands (from another point of view); \u2018Do not mess with me, I have granted myself Police powers. I am fully prepared to shoot you at any time, and for any reason, I think applies.\u2019 Proponents may call it self-defense, or exercising their rights, but from another point of view, it is an assumed claim to possibly be your Judge, Jury, and Executioner.\nOpenly carried firearms have no place at Government Offices, public establishments, or at protests on our streets where they increase tensions, constitute an extra-judicial mob, invite law-enforcement reprisals, and intensify police militarization. \n\n6.\t  Live by the Gun, Possibly Die by the Gun\n     Stand your ground laws are a legal path to anarchy, because, from either end of the gun, you can legally be the next victim. \n\u2018Stand Your Ground\u2019 laws say you only have to feel threatened to defend yourself, anywhere, at any time. Since it is often problematic to tell a good guy with a gun from a bad guy with a gun, anyone has the right under these laws, to feel threatened by civilian, open-carry. As a result, the threatened have the legal right to defend themselves. Like the Wild West, the problem turns into who shot first and why? The logic of these laws is indefensible.\n\n7.\tRapid-Firing, Multi-cartridge Weapons Are Weapons of Mass Destruction  \n     As a practical definition, any weapon that can kill many people quickly and easily (or silently) is a Weapon of Mass Destruction. \nDo the dead know any difference between a Bomb, a Chemical Weapon, or a Rapid-Fire, Multi-Cartridge Firearm? There is no responsible justification for civilians to own these weapons unless killing all your neighbors is considered self-defense. These are Weapons of War and Terrorism and otherwise have no practical use to society. We spend huge sums worldwide on our military to protect us from these weapons\u2026 just not on our streets. \n     Our Police, First Responders, and the Military are skilled public servants and deserve our support. Their lives are on the front line in the course of their duties. We should not ask them to face weapons of mass destruction, on duty or off. If you think clearly about it, no one on the streets of America, should. Own them legally or not, keep them responsibly, don\u2019t parade them in the streets, unless you are prepared to surrender them.\n\n8.\tMilitias Are Only Legal When Called Forth\n     Although militias are mentioned in the Second Amendment, It is settled law that they can legally exist only if, and when, called forth by a Governor or President. Militias are private armies and require responsible control. Unlike an Army with transparent command and control structures with civilian oversight, a militia is an armed mob, a form of terrorist cell, responsible only to themselves, and potentially hazardous to everyone else. A peaceful society cannot tolerate guerilla forces in their midst, and certainly not armed, private militaries parading in our streets or practicing for the overthrow of our government.    \n\nFinally, let\u2019s take a moment to send our thoughts and prayers for our brave American children who give up their lives to protect our current, almost entirely unregulated, 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.",

Never? They all send their kids to schools that are fortresses with competent armed security - designed to protect their kids from the very weapons they push for and defend.\n\nFor some reason in the US, someones personal liberty and freedoms completely supersedes not only safety, but common sense. Seriously, who cares if their are millions of \"law-abiding Americans\" that own assault-style weapons if there's even a remote chance they could fall into the hands of someone with ill-intentions - their lack of criminality has not stopped mass-shooters, plenty of perpetrators stole their guns from their parents.\n\nThe fact is, regardless of any semantics NRA-fanbois would like to argue, that assault weapons are not made for defense or hunting - they are designed to take down human targets with ease in a offensive manner, they don't serve a necessary defense purpose when you have access to shotguns, and if you really feel the need to \"be protected\" when out, carry a handgun.\n\nWhy on earth does a civilian need access to such a weapon; long-barreled guns with rifling, designed to be used **offensively**, no bolt action mechanism, equipped with a 1x optic and factory chambered in the same ammunition as used in warfare? Why is it sooo important that someone be allowed to own such dangerous and pointless weaponry when they are used in the weekly mass shootings that occur in the US?\n\nCommon sense would dictate weapons that have been designed to eliminate human targets should not be put into circulation just so some redneck MAGA-hat-wearing gunnut can obtain them to shoot beer cans with. The police can deem cars to be too powerful to be on the road without giving two shits about how responsible the driver is. Why isn't this same common sense applied to firearms in the US? Two words: NRA and Money.\n\nIf the NRA isn't just a bunch of evil moneygrubbing elitists, why aren't they fighting for peoples rights to own exotic and dangerous animals too? Maybe because owning a lion responsibly might be one thing, but what if someone \"irresponsible\" lets it out of its enclosure  and into the community?",

Wayne LaPierre is a Russian agent, therefore he and the others are turning the NRA into a Russian agency. \n\nAs soon as it is pointed out that the NRA is one of the agencies responsible for turning women against men by supporting this \"2nd Amendment Equality\" for the ladies, then ***perhaps*** some brave  citizen will show up at a NRA building or meeting and \"set things right\".  And then NRA and Republican Party can act like they always act  - offer \"thoughts and prayers\", same as for the schools.  \n\nAnd then they can also offer thoughts and prayers for any \"innocent\" lives lost - although maybe not so many thoughts or prayers as needed for Robb Elementary.",

They would get a gun just like they get drugs. If not in person, never underestimate the power of the dark web.\n\nIf you want to stop (or help) mass shootings it begins with mental health care. We need long term mental health facilities to house the severly mentally ill. Not just 14 day stretches in a hospitals psyc ward to only be let out to the street again with zero oversight. Do that as well as educate in Jr and Sr high about coming forward when a student/friend posts disturbing things on social media or says disturbing things to them. Teach them they can save lives.

To do what you proposed effectively we would need to get rid of our healthcare system and not only make it free and universal but raise the overall taxes like in other country\u2019s to make it work. Given how shit the economy is and despite the rich getting richer you have people like Bill Gates Elon Musk Mark Zuckerberg and more notoriously known for doing this Jeff Bezos doing tax evasion through donations, building hospitals and other legal loop holes essentially paying less or zip in taxes.\n\nFor your plan to work we would need to change the healthcare system and fight the push back from the people who profit from them -sane people who bribe politicians then somehow convince the entire American population to pay more in taxes despite the already shit economy this is why I think that Is way too idealistic to work. banning guns would have the fastest and most realistic results",

If you really want to know I'm libertarian more then anything but yeah, assume more things about what I think. \n\n>I already know that you feel like you rights to guns are more important that the lives of innocent people and children.\n\nYeah, I think the rights of all Americans are important. Rights are rarely handed down from the government and shouldn't be handed back with out thought. Bad guys with guns will always exist. The technology is getting better and better and half the guns I have I built myself. It's not hard at all.. but I follow the laws and yeah they are needed for me. Cops are always 20 minutes aways, probably more since I'm in the country. It took the cops 40 fucking minutes to breach that building and it was in the middle of town!!! I'm not saying everyone should carry a gun but you should have the right to if you choose. I would rather have one and never need it than need one and not have it. \n\nI feel horrible for those kids and the parents. It is fucking crazy that someone would even want to do that. they would have to be insaine.. but I guess that's my point..",

Any gun can kill, why not ban pistols? Why not ban shotguns? Someone could do just as much damage with any of those guns. So why just stop at the AR? Would banning this type of gun stop people from wanting to kill eachother? Will it actually accomplish anything anything in the end? I mean your own solution still has guns on the street.. they will still be able to get them.. \n\n\nand you are right, the cops did go in before the 44 minute mark.. but just to retreat again for \"safety and cover\" lol but just look at the fucking time-line yourself.\n\nhttps://www.texastribune.org/2022/05/27/uvalde-texas-school-shooting-timeline/\n\nLol and it wasn't even a cop that killed him, it was a off duty border patrol unit.. yeah they will save you... eventually I guess...",

I am for reasonable people being able to own a weapon. I do not believe any one person should be able to own an arsenal of weapons without some kind of strict oversight. I believe obviously unwell people should be barred from *legally* owning a weapon. I do not believe it should be easier to buy a tool used specifically for killing than it is to buy a home to live in or a car to drive. I believe that because of you lot, we are too far gone and banning guns outright would end the same or worse than the prohibition era.\n\nYou are actively arguing against limiting a potential mass shooter's ease of access to deadly weapons. Even if those for banning guns are by some strange twist of reality somehow slowing down progress towards fewer violent deaths, you and yours are actively making it worse by fighting for guns to *legally* be in the hands of those they shouldn't be in. Why do you believe God is okay with that?",

The ending where God makes it clear that the both God and the world are so complex and vast that one cannot understand everything as to why things happen is a far more consistent conclusion to make to God's character explanation for God's actions throughout the book. I think that the book is deeper then you give it credit for, frankly, and I would recommend a second, more in-depth read.",

I mean, if it's only the mentally ill who are committing these atrocities, and if we are the only nation with literally hundreds of mass school shootings in as little as 5 years, then surely we should be concerned with the staggering number of \"psychopaths\" in our midst. \n\nAnd yet, here's the thing: there are mentally ill people in literally every country worldwide. We do *not* have a significantly higher population of potential psychopaths in our midst. What we *do* have is states with dangerously lax gun laws, wherein gun licenses are not requisite,, background checks are not enforced, and (as was proven in a recent study) someone as young as 13 years old can easily purchase a rifle, but is protectively guarded from buying alcohol, tobacco, or lottery tickets.",

I know they ship kilos and shit.\n\nAs far as the mentally ill, I know England has long term mental health hospitals. Other country's have free healthcare. So the mental health aspect is,  these people seem to get help as here they really don't. They get put in a hospital psyc ward for 14 days max then let go regardless. The last shooting at Uvlade the kid used to ride his bike around with a dead cat like definetly one of the characteristics of psychopathy. We have all the famous serial killers too.

This video also cut out the portion where he tried to get the audience to chant \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d and was yelling that probably at least 10 times with no one joining in. It was awkward and makes me think most knew he was trolling. There was also clapping after pretty much everyone who spoke, so they were just following form I think. I clapped too. Nonetheless, I thought it was funny and a ballsy move lol",
