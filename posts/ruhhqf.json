If it did survive, it would have been taken to Babylon, because the AM religion took conquered gods and stored them all together.  In that instance, it may have persisted for 60 more years until the Achaemenid Empire destroyed the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylon, and even the barest chance of finding further documentation.",

You may have heard of him - they named a ship in the matrix over him. \n\nThe ark resided in the temple in Jerusalem at the time. When I say the temple I mean *the* temple. Think angry man of God flippin tables of money changers and shit. \n\nDid ole N word take the ark? Destroy it? Who really knows. \n\nI don\u2019t speak Greek or Aramaic or any of that, but I know the KJV has the ark mentioned in revelations which is New Testament and obviously after any real history of the ark. \n\nThe ark had terrifying power btw. It was the container in which the 10 commandments were held. It was very ornate and how it was depicted in the movie with 2 angels on the lid was how it was depicted and described for centuries. Also it was reverent and supposedly when God came to Earth he would judge people from atop the ark. \n\nThis is from the top of my head - another thing about the ark - a large group of people beheld the ark and were subject to Gods judgement. I can\u2019t remember if they looked inside or not. There\u2019s more to the ark that I can\u2019t remember. \n\nAlso there were rumors that the knights Templar moved the ark to North America from Europe after that crazy French fucker killed them off for debt owed. (What\u2019s his name) \n\nAnyway, this has been ark news. Happy new year",

The Holy Spirit is NOT generated. Your insistence otherwise is a massive and demonstrable error. The filioque denigrates the personage the Holy Spirit and reduces Him to a mere function. \n\nLook at the bad fruit of Rome since their adoption of the filioque. They broke away from the Church, inspired the protestant deformation, and now they have clown mass and yoga clubs in the parish and  pachamama in the Vatican. \n\nLay people are called to correct heresy and to defend the faith from attacks. Your insistence that I include heresy in the Creed is horrific. You want to pretend it doesnt matter because you arent prepared to defend it.\n\nOne Lord. One faith. One baptism. \n\nYour adoption of filioque denies the Monarchia of the Father, which is the One Faith as you admit is taught by Council, and is thus foreign to Christianity. Your inclusion of filioque is also a refutation of so-called \"papal infallibility\", as  Rome believes that the Godhead has two heads and the Body of Christ has two heads.

Ignored and will not get into further debate with you on the matter.\n\nWhy do effeminate men always claim they will not debate and then proceed to offer more arguments? It is because everything you said is an attempted distraction from your inability to defend the filioque as a doctrine. \n\nYou dont get to call me a heretic, papist. Your Church recognizes my faith. Eastern rites under Rome say the Creed properly. They also recognize St. Gregory Palamas in their liturgical calander, who is most famous for dismantling western theology altogether. The reason your sect recognizes any and everything from Orthodoxy to Pachamama is that the RCC does not care what you believe as long as you kiss the popes ring. Your own canon law says our sacraments are valid and should be sought. Your popes have written encyclicals praising my faith. Our saints have been consistently clear that you do not have the sacraments.\n\nPolitical squabbles are not the same thing as abandoning the Apostolic faith to worship a man. Neither the Greeks nor Russians are calling each other heretics. Both sides recognize the faith and sacraments of the other because the schism is purely political. A conflict in Ukraine will never compare to your sect covering up scandals with tithe money for open homosexuals admitted to the clergy who abused children. Your attempt to claim otherwise is a typical expression of papist deparation.  \n\nEvery Roman Catholic who has ever added the filioque to the creed is a heretic. Your pope kisses korans and claims atheists go to heaven. If you honestly want to claim anyone on earth is a bigger heretic, you have a difficult task ahead of you. You dont want to admit that because it is just one of many examples of papal infallibility being absolutely ridiculous.",

In John 15:26. \"But when the Helper comes, **whom I will send to you from the Father**, the Spirit of truth, **who proceeds from the Father**, He will\u00a0bear witness\u00a0about me.\" Christ states plainly that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and refers to the Holy Spirit as \"He\" showing the personage of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is not a function as your creed claims. \n\nYou have to *imagine* a scenario where I would live my life in opposition to Christ's teachings.

When one of the oxen carrying the ark stumbled, an Israelite rushed to prevent it from falling over, and he dropped dead the instant he touched it. His name was Uzzah, he's mentioned in Samuel and Chronicles iirc.\n\nI think the part about looking at it is a legend that derives from how it's often said to have been carried covered in cloth, combined with it's close relation to God. People who aren't very holy are also said to die from seeing God directly. This could easily just be people trying to keep dust and sand off of the gold though, and people misinterpreting why it's covered. Lots of people in scripture saw it and didn't die.\n\nAbout the virgin monks tending to it, that's an Ethiopian Church rule, but i think it's more for the safety of the Ark then the safety of the people tending to it.",

That sounds like classic unconditional love. /S\n\nThink about what you use \"faith\" to allow yourself to believe. You don't think it's at all possible that a man with no knowledge beforehand could attribute a REAL static SHOCK to maaaaybe being the work of God, who he believes is responsible for ALL?\n\nYou know, faith is a virtue where he came from. Our beliefs shape our life experiences just as much as our lives shape our beliefs.\n\nThing about faith is that it's designed specifically to cover for what we don't know. Meaning that when real answers may be eventually be found, you will remain blind to them, locked down by years or decades of having already lived in one certain way due to your \"faith\" and having too much misplaced \"pride\" in your blind faith to be able to admit that you could have been wrong the entire time.\n\nThe introduction of new information will not change your opinion, because it was never based on actual information or your personal life experience. That's why it's faith.\n\nI think it's actually kind of plausible to think it could have been something unknown, like a static shock, which is immediate and probably easily capable of scaring someone who has never felt one before; exponentially so if it occured directly upon making physical contact with something they are never even supposed to touch, supposedly under God's own orders.\n\nThinking 'maybe God is radioactive and likes to kill us' seems like a tiny bit more of a stretch, to me. What, because it's more like movies you've seen or legends you've heard?? Heat death?? Yeah, ok.\n\nYou should probably keep in mind how often humans are wrong. How much humans exaggerate. Maybe it would also be wise to keep in mind how frequently and stupidly human beings just go ahead and outright lie to one another, and especially to themselves, unless you're still in denial of that little fact of our lives.\n\nWhat kind of faith do you really have? In what is real or likely real, or just in what's most comfortable for you personally?\n\nJust because you have faith, doesn't mean you have to be blind.",

Chirst was rejected as the prophesied messiah in the old testament by the Jews and thus Christians who accepted Jesus as that figure became a splinter religion. There are Jewish sects that keep the traditions of the Jewish faith alive but also accept Christ today but since many of his teachings contradict the Talmud they are supposedly still awaiting the arrival of the messiah in the physical world. However, given what Revelation says about the issue, a new \"savior\" on the world would be the antichrist. Thats a common misconception about the second coming, Christ's return is purely spiritual in the Christain tradition. This creates a tension between the supposedly parallel sects, one's savior would be the others enemy. \n\nThe gnostics had some rather interesting interprations of this dynamic but they were purged as heretics around the time of the crusades. There is also Cabalism, Catharism and Templarism that are mystical offshoots that sprang up around that same period as this issue reached its climax. \n\nToday, most people ignore the issue posed by these differing interpretations as there really is no way to solve the problem. So saying \"Jesus was a Jew\" doesn't really accomplish anything, although it was technically correct at the time it doesn't solve the tensions between the faiths in today's context.",

Furthermore blood sacrifice in the Jewish faith persisted after Christ's death, which the teachings of the new testament not only made irrelevant, but forbidden. Christ's main mission in his early adulthood was reformation of the church. The Jewish church. That's part of why they rejected him as the promised messiah. They figured that their savior would never tell them they are wrong. Those who reformed from the advice of Christ, Paul and others became the foundation of the new Christian faith. Those that did not are today's Jews.",

                  "text": "The Biblical account goes like this:  The Jewish religious authorities arranged his arrest and brought him before ~~Herod~~Pontius Pilate (the Roman authority) claiming he was stirring up shit.  ~~Herod~~ Pontius Pilate couldn\u2019t find any fault with him but also didn\u2019t want to piss off the Jewish ruling class.  So instead of just letting him go he decided to pass the decision on to crowd that had gathered.  It being Passover, a massive feast day and their being a tradition of releasing prisoners he decided he would get the crowd to free Jesus for him.  So ~~Herod~~ Pontius Pilate brought brought Barrabas and Jesus before the largely Jewish crowd and asked them who to free.  \n\nNow Barrabas was a violent revolutionary and many scholars think the text indicates he was a murderer, but at the very least he was notorious for trying to overthrow a Roman rule (exactly what the priests accused Jesus of btw).  He likely wasn\u2019t that popular and ~~Herod~~ Pontius probably thought he did some clever politicking to free Jesus while also not pissing off the Jewish elite.  \n\nUnfortunately the priests went out into the crowd and convinced them to ask for Barrabas, and so when ~~Herod~~Pontius Pilate asked the crowd they demanded Barrabas be set free.  When ~~Herod~~Pontius Pilate asked what to do with Jesus, stating that he found that Jesus did no wrong the crowd yelled, \u201cCrucify him!\u201d  ~~Herod~~ Pilate said he washed his hands of the matter, basically saying it\u2019s not on me, it\u2019s on you all.  \n\nAnd so we have the origin that the Jews were responsible for the death of Jesus.  How much is true?  Idk, the gospels largely agree but they shared sources (Google the gospel \u201cQ\u201d) and there was an interest by the apostles to have Jesus killed by the Jews in order to fulfill certain OT prophecies (the stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone and all that).  Personally as a non-religious person who believes in a historical Jesus I think there are a lot of elements of truth to the story, and probably some exaggerations as well.  \n\nUltimately even if the crowd of Jews that day cried out \u201cCrucify him\u201d regarding the blood of an innocent man then it speaks less to some racial defect of the Hebrew people and more so to the absolute horror of crowd manipulation and group thought.  They were hardly the first or last crowd of people to savagely execute an innocent person for no real reason except that\u2019s just kind of how the mood of the crowd turned.  \n\nAnd as far as those sneaky, hypocritical Jewish religious figures which basically serve as the villians of the gospel.  People have pointed to their behavior as justification for antisemitism for 2000 years as well, but let\u2019s really be honest.  They act exactly like any out of touch authority figures who are losing control of narrative.  The fact that they are Jewish doesn\u2019t really matter.  They are the Societal elite and Jesus poses a threat to them, so they do whatever they can to undermine then remove that threat and retain their power.  It\u2019s a story we\u2019ve seen a million times.  People who laser focus on race with them are choosing to ignore the thousands of stories of gentiles who act the exact same way.  But then again that\u2019s kind of what racists do.",

Take some LSD with a close friend and report back to me.
