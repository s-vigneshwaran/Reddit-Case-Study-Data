What's with this doubt?  Shouldn't it be 100%?\"\n\nIt's just a bullshit \"gotcha\" question.  At least Bill Nye didn't fall into that trap.  Regardless, that's not what I would call arguing in good faith if his intent is to paint the \"authority\" on his show in doubt and question the legitimacy of climate change.  \n\n0 Tucker Carlson, 1 Bill Nye",

Even some cooling effects like aerosols and net forest growth in recent years are caused by humans. But the much larger effect is from fossil fuels and agricultural methane.\n\nIPCC also quantifies how much uncertainty they have in their models, which might be interpreted as random or natural causes. They're tiny. Way under 10%. So we can confidently say that humans are causing more than 90% of climate change, probably more like 99%.",

That's why he has that stupid fucking look on his face the whole time, and why he does the head tilts. Viewers who don't really understand climate change or understand what Nye is saying will see Carlson behaving in ways that suggest Nye is unhinged and making nonsensical arguments and will conclude if Carlson is confused, Nye must be saying silly things. Quite an effective tool.",

Any response is rethrown out there with another question, and so it goes until the person responding stumbles and then you just pounce on that.  It's all about making the person on the other side of the debate look bad, not about addressing the issue or even about making good points.\n\nBill Nye, to his credit, did an excellent job of not being flustered and keeping it cool.  Tucker Carlson even calls Bill Nye a bully at the end, which makes me think Tucker honestly believed he'd have shaken Bill Nye's resolve by the end.  Of course he didn't do that, it just made Tucker look like an ass.  To be fair, all Tucker Carlson has to do to look like an ass is to go on television, so not a difficult accomplishment there.",

You could buy a $15 folding chair or a $1,000 antique without the slightest difficulty. By contrast, to obtain an X-ray you\u2019d have to work with your insurance company, wait for an appointment, and then haggle over price. Why? Because the medical market is far more regulated \u2014 thanks to the widespread perception that health care is a \u201cright\u201d \u2014 than the chair market.*\n\n\n*Does that sound soulless? True soullessness is depriving people of the choices they require because you\u2019re more interested in patting yourself on the back by inventing rights than by incentivizing the creation of goods and services. In health care, we could use a lot less virtue signaling and a lot less government.

You continually throw out questions, and any question that isn't answered is pounced upon.  Any misstep is pounced upon.  Any literal mistake is mocked and made to look like you don't understand what you're saying.\n\nBut, of course, that doesn't mean what you side with is wrong.  It doesn't mean you don't make valid points.  It doesn't even imply you're not a good debater.  It's kind of an ass \"gotcha\" play, and it works only to the uneducated who think a really well-constructed insult is the same as a good counterargument.  That said, Bill Nye kept cool the entire time.  Not a lot was really discussed, but the few points Bill Nye made were directly answering Tucker Carlson's questions, even if Tucker Carlson pretended that he didn't.",

Anything that can make the interruptions look like failures themselves\u2014and more importantly, make them **feel** like failures to the other person\u2014**might** just make them stop, or at least slow down, if only for a moment.\n\n- Casually curious: **\u201cYou keep interrupting me. Why are you so upset?\u201d**  \n- Disdainfully direct: **\u201cDid you only invite me here to rush through your little checklist of questions without waiting for my answers?\u201d**  \n- Playfully pointed: **\u201cIs there a delay in our connection? On this end, at least, you\u2019re talking over me so much that it\u2019s almost like you don\u2019t want your audience to hear my answers!\u201d**  \n- Sweetly sympathetic: **\u201cIf you didn\u2019t understand my answer, then I\u2019m happy to make it even simpler for you.\u201d**\n\nYes, it\u2019s a shame we even have to think like this. But look at it this way: *The time we spend identifying and learning the actual facts about **anything** is time they can spend **solely** on coming up with more effective ways to sell whatever complete and utter nonsense they\u2019ve decided to collectively believe next.* If we don\u2019t disrupt their \u201cfeel right\u201d approach first, then being correct won\u2019t matter.\n\n**FN 1:** So much of the modern right-wing playbook is *entirely* about the look, whether it\u2019s for the sake of their home audience (who\u2019s often too ignorant to understand the substance of the discussion anyway) or their captive audience in office lobbies and other places of business (who isn\u2019t choosing to watch but might still catch glimpses of their talking heads and read their chyrons even when the sound isn\u2019t audible).",

The reality behind d global warming is that at this pace there is a real possibility of a future without humans. \n\nThe dangers of climate change are vast and the two main ones aren\u2019t seafront homes disappearing; they are:\n\n1) climate change will further destabilize countries by stressing natural resources.  Food and water will be harder to come by in developing nations who will turn to violence and conflict to feed their populations\n\n2) the solubility of calcium carbonate in water/oceans is inversely proportional to temperature.  When temperatures go up the solubility of CaCO3 goes down.  This mineral is the building block for all the creatures that form the foundation of the oceanic food pyramid.  Ecological collapse of the marine ecosystem is a very real consequence of oceanic warming.  Because these changes are happening so rapidly it is outpacing nature\u2019s ability to evolve in the presence of environmental stresses.\n\nBill has a good heart, but going on Fox and trying to add his opinion to that echo chamber is a fools errand.",

What they did not agree on was that a 1 degree change in temp was so devastating that it requires a transition away from fossil fuels.  Yet that is what the green movement wants you to believe.  \nAnd I think it\u2019s ridiculous that anyone actually buys into the notion that \u2018green\u2019 energy is somehow gathered from \u2018non finite\u2019 sources. \nYes, green energy is sourced from hopefully unending wind or solar, but the materials needed to harness that energy are certainly not infinite.  The rare minerals needed make batteries to store green energy certainly are not any less finite than oil and gas. \nAnd the truth is that fewer humans are dying as the earth warms.  More humans die every year from cold than from heat.  Food supply increases with longer growing seasons. \n\nI\u2019m not against green energy.  I believe that every resource should be used where necessary for the betterment of all. \nBanning fossil fuel is a nonsensical goal.  Even if we were not using it for fuel, it would still be necessary to produce oil for plastics, rubber medicines and other necessities. \nI\u2019ll leave you with one last thought. \nThe world has changed temps, dramatically and repeatedly over its existence.  Retreating glaciers have exposed human encampments buried for centuries.  So if it was warmer in the past and civilization thrived, why would anyone believe that we couldn\u2019t still thrive now with all the advancements in technology? \nAnd if it was warmer in the past than it currently is, just who determines what the \u2018norm\u2019 for optimal living conditions are? \nThe fact is, there are not too many places on this planet you can point to where humans don\u2019t live.  We live everywhere, from frozen tundras to barren deserts.  Regardless of temperatures, we adapt.  One degree over the next hundred years, even if that\u2019s faster than would have happened without our influence, is not going to change that.\nNot trying to change your mind about anything, just offering food for thought. \nEnjoy your day.",

If scientists know that the cause of global warming is man-made, then it isn't unreasonable to expect science to be able to quantify our contribution. \n\nBecause Tucker's question was so direct, it was opportunity for Nye to give a direct answer, demonstrate his expertise, shut down the \"natural\" argument, and educate   on the reasons for why science confidence is so justified. \n\nUnfortunately, Nye refused or was unable to give a direct response. I suspect it was because Nye didn't know the answer and he didn't want to reveal his ignorance. \n\nA much more trustworthy answer would have been: \"that's a very good question. I don't know the answer to that. But I can tell you all the reasons why we do know that humans are driving the change...\"\n\nYears ago when I was open to the possibility but hesitant to believe climate change was man made because I didn't have enough information, this debate would have supported my hesitancy and nudged me toward Tucker's perspective.",

When ornithologists studying changing bird behaviors in Europe caused by the decrease in insect numbers evidenced by years and years of audio recordings of the insect noises that only begins to happen at certain times of the year which have reached certain temperatures, share findings with oceanographers from South America doing research on XYZ, and so on and so on, eventually everyone realized that they are all seeing correlated and interconnected changes in the rate of environment change.\n\nThe unit measurements of bird and insect behaviors don\u2019t jive with ocean temperature measurements, so it\u2019s not like Bill can say \u201cOk the climate is changing at a rate of 10 cricket decibels per gallon of ocean water above 62.6 degrees\u201d. \n\nTucker knows that Bill can\u2019t explain climate change to a non-scientifically literate audience in a 5 min segment, because it isn\u2019t that simple.\n\nTucker is a piece of shit contrarian.",

Or assuming that gravity just stops working at *some* distance because it falls off as an inverse square of the radius. I ask them to apply the equation for universal gravitation or a buoyancy equation and they refuse every time. They've got an assumption of how gravity works that's wrong, they won't apply a testable equation to reality to see if it's accurate, and sometimes even go so far as to deny that math can even describe physics at all.\n\nIt's proud, willful ignorance to win a short-term battle.",

It sounds ridiculous. We have been tracking weather for like 200 years, and for a large portion of those years we have no idea how good the tech is, at least I don\u2019t. Do u sincerely think that this is the hottest the earth has ever been? That this is the most CO2 emissions the earth has ever seen? Since 2005 we have had 10 of the hottest years recorded. That\u2019s 10 out of the last 17 years have been the hottest ever recorded in 200ish years. The earth is built to protect us from this, otherwise the world would have ended over extreme volcanic activity millions of years ago. No doubt that we have an effect on the world, that\u2019s obvious. But it\u2019s not that big of an effect. Of course we should switch to all electric things when we can, but we aren\u2019t ready yet. Lithium mining will kill this planet faster than anything, so until we have a new way of making batteries, an infinite supply of electricity, and no way for government to control this electricity on demand, we can\u2019t have it.

Well yea, but I\u2019m still 100% responsible for the cake\u2019s existence because i mixed the ingredients, poured them into a pan, and stuck the pan in an oven that i turned on.

Why has the average temperature gone down in x place? \n\nBill: because local variations are not global trends, that's part of why we say climate change rather than global warming. The large majority of the globe has warmed, we have satellite data from NASA, historic ocean temperatures, ice cores, all showing warming.\n\nTucker: oh so when the data doesn't agree with your viewpoint, just conveniently change the name to climate change, but not the belief. That's what you are accusing skeptics of doing.\n\nBill: no, on average the world is getting warmer and is projected by x date to be x warmer than it was in 1900. The world is warming, and catastrophically fast.\n\nTucker: what's so special about that time, why focus then? Wasn't there a little ice age a couple hundred years ago? The climate is always changing.\n\nBill: but not like this. The climate is warming faster than any change we have data for by x orders of magnitude. \n\nTucker: but you already said before that it was warmer when the dinosaurs were around. They were fine for millions of years. How do we know how quickly the temperature changed back then? Were you there? What rate of change is too high?\n\nBill: we can't put a number on that because-\n\nTucker: oh so you DONT know. And you call skeptics crazy for not believing the guy who admits we have no idea. \n\nBill: I didnt-\n\nTucker: you just did! See, these pseudo science types pretend to be skeptical only to get the outcome they want and then they insult everyone who isn't convinced.\n\nBill: look we can't put a number on the rate of change because it is impossible to calculate how rate of change relates to harm to various extremely complex ecosystems-\n\nTucker: so it's too complex for us to understand.\n\nBill: No. That does not mean we don't know that the rate of change is far too high now. We know ecosystems are starting to collapse. Our climate models have accurately predicted, and sometimes undershot the rate of warming, and we know the consequences will bring famine, more natural disasters, wars, massive immigration-\n\nTucker: but you just said you don't even know what the rate of change needs to be. You can't put a number on it. Yet you claimed to have the answers. You think we are crazy for asking scientific questions when you can't answer them, and wonder why we don't trust you. It's laughable. We don't know what will happen in the future. We can't even predict the weather two weeks out and you're talking decades into the future like you have some crystal ball.",

We can measure the amount of emissions coming from human society and use that to estimate what the Earth's \"natural\" temperature would be without humans and the answer is it would be slightly cooler. So humans are literally responsible for all of it. The average rate of increase is 0.18\u00b0C / 0.32\u00b0F per year since 1981. That would have been literally less than zero without humans it would have been essentially the same to very very slightly cooler without humans. \n\nIf you have a burger in the fridge and I hit it with a flame thrower, what percentage of the blame should I get for the temperature change of the burger. That's how much is due to measurable changes in our atmosphere from human activity. All of it.",

It was not a new source of oil for us, and would not have made a difference in us being fuel independent. \n\nThe narrative that it would have increased our oil supply here at home or that shutting it down has anything to do with current gas prices is a completely made up right wing talking point. The media heads driving home that talking point know it's horseshit, but they know their readers/viewers don't and won't look more into it, and it will make them angry, and that's all that matters to them.",

                              "text": "That's funny, because I can also find credible sources that say the Green New Deal wouldn't hurt the economy. The thing is everyone has a stake in the issues presented, and the ones talking about how much it will damage the economy always seem to be in, funded by, or invested in the industries that will stand to lose by the bill. The thing is, that doesn't mean the economy will suffer because other industries will grow because of the bill. https://news.stanford.edu/2019/03/28/strengths-weaknesses-green-new-deal/ When it comes down it, it's actually complicated and hard to tell what the effects will be, but many of the experts who have the least stake in the issue seem to be optimistic about it having a positive affect on the economy. \n\nOn to the energy independent claim. That's flat out wrong. We are completely capable of energy independence and always shave been. Even Forbes, which is fairly biased towards big business agrees on this. https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2022/03/08/surprise-the-us-is-still-energy-independent/?sh=12bca8c230b6 Moreover the Keystone XL pipeline he cancelled would be transporting oil from Canada, so it wouldn't even be contributing to energy independence (because it wouldn't be domestic).\n\nThe reason we're seeing an increase in prices despite this is because we're in a global market and the supply went down which increases prices elsewhere. This causes the price to rise domestically because companies don't give two shits about America so they'll sell wherever they can make the most profits, so domestic prices therefore increase until the companies see as much profit here as they do abroad. \n\nNow on to the \"We are literally feeling the results of these BS climate change politics\", which is just wrong. Even if Biden hadn't shut down the exon pipeline, the prices would be pretty much the same because of the lack of Russian oil, which has nothing to do with climate change policy. Largely price increases are due to flaws in the just in time production model (which was poorly copied from Toyota with bad oversight on what things need to have a reserve instead of using JIT) which was exacerbated by COVID slowing down port usage and also by inflation in part caused by PPP loans from Trump and corporate greed taking advantage of the ability to increase prices. I want to be clear that the increase in shipping costs from increasing fuel prices shouldn't be a large factor in inflation because shipping accounts for a very small percentage in the cost of most goods when you're talking about the transporting using massive freight ships. \n\nMoreover complaining about how you shouldn't cause problems now to deal with worse problems later is just naive and short sighted. I don't know if you've ever heard the phrase \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\", but it certainly applies here. As we continually put off dealing with climate change we're in making inevitably dealing with it MORE damaging for the economy.",

With how picky vintners are about their grapes and the required investment, in both time and money, they're not likely to bet on some new variety of grape that may produce bad wine. So it's reasonable to assume they're using some sort of heritage grape that requires a more Mediterranean climate.",

It has to be intentional.\n\nHumans love alcohol, wine has alcohol. Especially when it's safer to drink than water sure to alcohols antibacterial properties. Especially before modern water sterilization practices, mixing alcohol with water was about the best, and easiest, way to make something that was safe to drink. Before the advent of modern transportation, means the wine needed to be made close to where it's needed. \n\nRomans drank both wine and beer, and lived in a climate that was hospitable for growing wine grapes. In the northern parts of Europe, only beer was produced. Since we know the Romans loved both wine and beer and we know the Roman empire stretched across most of Europe, including Britain, it's reasonable to assume they would try and produce wine near wherever they are, since they would need it to have a safe drinking water supply (also alcohol) and it would have been prohibitive to try and ship it constantly. So it makes sense for them to try and grow what they need locally.\n\nWe have records of the climate from the regions above, and we know what climate wine grapes thrive in, it's reasonable to assume Romans would have tried growing grapes wherever they could, but the climate in the north was inhospitable to it.\n\nSince the climate requirement hasn't changed for the growth of wine grapes, but the climate has, they're now able to grow grapes where they probiotic couldn't. This is called direct evidence. It wasn't Nye's \"final point\" but meant as a tangible example of climate change.\n\nSince we have a good idea how much CO2 and other greenhouse gases are being emitted currently, both human made and naturally, and have core samples showing what concentrations were thousands of years ago. We can compare the atmospheric levels from those samples to current atmospheric concentrations to see that today's concentrations are significantly higher, without significantly higher natural emissions. From that we can conclude that given no human emissions, the climate would still be very similar to what it was hundreds of years ago instead of the now hospitable climate for growing wine grapes. \n\nThe only thing I've lost here is my time trying to explain basic concepts to a wall.",

Shouldn\u2019t they have a voice too? Listen, I\u2019m just asking questions! Shouldn\u2019t it be ok to ask questions?\u201d\n\nBut I'll answer that question for you, Tucker.  It's because Nazis, and people like you, would kill off everyone who disagreed with you, if given the opportunity.  And since I generally feel that wholesale slaughter of groups of people is a *bad* thing, Nazism should not be promoted in any way shape or form.

His intention being that, when Nye inevitably can't give a number, he can claim that \"see? it's not a closed debate. We still don't know anything about climate change\". Of course, the question by itself is stupid. How can you measure what percentage of change is made by humans, why would you measure that specifically and why would anyone know even if it was somehow measured?\n\nWhat we do in science is to take into account the activities humans do, observe their effects in the environment, compare how the environment changes now vs how it changed in the past, and how it changes when we stop certain activities. From all these data we've already PROVEN and it's a CLOSED DEBATE that the climate change has accelerated exponentially in the last ~60 years, that this change threatens to fuck up the world (and is already doing it) in many ways, that human activities are expected to alter the climate exactly in the way the climate is being altered and that there's a lot of correlations between certain human activities and an increase in the bad markers we use for climate change. With this info, people can do whatever they want, they are free to say \"hey, I love Mad Max and want to live in a post-apocalyptic world so let's contaminate a lot more!!\". But what you cannot do is to deny these proven facts.\n\nFor a comparison, it's like you spent a whole year analyzing every inch of your house, finding problems, proposing solutions, taking measurements, taking notes of every material used to build your floors, your walls, etc. And, when you finally claim \"well, I know everything there is to know about my home, I know its problems and its solutions\" some massive moron asked \"how comfy is your bedroom? You say you know it all, so give me the exact number of how comfy your bedroom is. Is it 73 comfy? 140.81 comfy? See? You cannot answer, so maybe you don't know anything about your home and you are just pretending.\"",

He tells Tucker \u201cdegree is the word you chose\u201d knowing that answering with a degree or percentage is impossible to calculate. He tells him it\u2019s not about degree but about rate of change. But immediately Tucker asks another impossible follow-up question asking how quickly we\u2019ve increased the rate of change. An exact number is impossible to say, which puts it in their mind that maybe he\u2019s not actually an expert, which Tucker predictably jumps on.",

It starts as a lie, and later when recalling the memory, their brain reconstructs it as a belief they held and they forgot it was ever a lie. Their personality trait is to say things in bad faith to emphasis a point, which then becomes their later beliefs in a feed back loop of self brain washing.\n\nLike the cliche of everytime dad tells a story about that fish he caught it gets bigger.

They think it's still a fair while off, and they have the money and influence to insulate themselves from any real issues during the remainder of their lifetime.  \nAs CC becomes more obvious they'll spin away and change their arguments so they never appear to be the bad guys. There will never be a moment where they look at their shoes and say \"I'm sorry everyone I was wrong.\"  \nImagine we're in a car heading for a cliff and they're driving.  \nFirst it's \"there is no cliff, calm down everyone. It's hoax.\"  \nThen \"Guys, it's not even a big cliff. More like a hill. You'll barely feel it.\"  \n\"Ok maybe it's a big cliff, but by the time we get there someone will have thought of a way to survive it. It's not our job to change course now. It's *their* job to figure it out.\"  \n\"Look, driving off a cliff is a natural process, it happens to everyone. We'll be fine.\"  \n\"Ok fine maybe it'll kill us, but I don't know what you want *me* to do, it's not like I'm the one driving!\"  \n\"Ok maybe I AM driving, but do you have any idea how hard it would be to change course NOW?\"  \n\"Look, the time to change course was 2 minutes ago, there's not point arguing about it now. We were warned far too late to do anything about this issue.\"  \n\"Stop trying to pin blame on each other guys, come on. Lets just try to enjoy the time we have left. All this finger-pointing is just petty and childish.\"\n\nThis is how it will go, mark my words. They will never accept any form of blame at all, and will gaslight and spin spin spin away from any sort of responsibility.",

You take away that win by refusing to play their game and being calm and saying shit positive about the person being an asshole in hopes of getting you angry. It's one of my favorite things to do to angry and irrational people. They come at you with some hard aggression, look at them and give them a compliment. Or say something like \"I love you too man. Have a great day.\" It's not the response they are expecting or wanting. They never have a plan for that. In their mind, no one would say something like that to them. It disarms them and weakens them.  Bill is doing just that. He is putting aside the fact that Fucker is a POS and saying that he loves him like he loves every other person on this planet. Because that is the type of person Bill is. Even if he doesn't agree with them, he can still find room in his heart for them and love them just for being another miracle of this universe. For worse or better. Bill is showing he is a bigger and better person with that statement, without actually using those words. This is how smart and rational people think and act. Bill knows this and is doing his best to teach us all even if it isnt obvious or even about science. He is using his air time to show how we should act as humans living together on this rock.\n\nEdited to say \"Fucker\" should say \"Tucker\".  My apologies if anyone was offended.

This simply lays out how out of his league Fucker is; Nye is not an expert in that field, yet simple knowledge is enough to refute him. Fucker asked for how much humans are responsible for climate change, yet Nye did not have the stat. There is an actual percent available, and scientists say it is 94% responsible. Nye said himself that we were(edit I think I was misunderstood here I originally wrote we're using it as a contraction for we were but that version is uncommon and likely is not part of standard english thanks for pointing it out u/gamestoreguy) heading into an ice age, which means the temperature is dropping gradually, yet the temperature Nye said was at 1750s levels yet in reality they would be lower than they were in the 1750s they'd have kept dropping.",

Some other caveats: tv news shows in 10 minute segments are a genuinely terrible way to communicate, I believe in man made global warming, and I'm a member of one of those skeptic organizations Nye mentioned being a part of in this interview.\n\nThis interview wasn't about climate change, Carlson didn't bring Nye on to debate climate change.   Carlson brought Nye on to debate the idea that people who disagree with 'the science' are delusional and that it's appropriate to float the idea that some people should be jailed over denying it.  \n\nPer the tv news is awful, they didn't get too far into the former, but here's the context https://www.climatedepot.com/2016/04/14/bill-nye-the-jail-the-skeptics-guy-nye-entertains-idea-of-jailing-climate-skeptics-for-affecting-my-quality-of-life-exclusive-video/\n\nIt's an interesting question, should people who deny global warming be jailed? I could easily entertain every side, from \"Of course, some people in some specific places of power that knowingly deny Climate Change and apply policies that could kill many people deserve jail\" to \"Even entertaining the idea that you should jail anybody for disagreeing with something is insane.\"  \n\nAgain, with the TV is awful, Carlson's goal when he was trying to pin Nye down on the percent was to get Nye to admit that there are still ambiguities, I don't know off hand, but I'm pretty sure the error bars for what Carlson was asking are decently big.   Nye didn't want to admit that because on Fox if he said \"We don't know x about this specific part of Climate Change\" then Fox views will think it's not real which is a reasonable concern, but I think Carlson would have just used that as a point in the 'maybe we shouldn't jail skeptics\" column.  \n\nIt's actually a very interesting conversation, and we can apply it to a much less controversial subject 4 years later, Covid :).   Lockdowns are 'the science' and to have said that lockdowns are a terrible idea was denying science.  I'm sure many floated that lockdown opponents should be jailed, certainly accusing them of wanting to kill Grandma.  And Lockdown opponents were kicked off social media, social media jail if you will.    Well it turned out lockdowns were horrific economically and there are studies showing that they [might not have been that great at protecting grandma](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/02/06/did-so-called-johns-hopkins-study-really-show-lockdowns-were-ineffective-against-covid-19/?sh=323b6adb1225), the science is certainly still out.   Maybe floating jail was a bad idea.\n\nSo I donno, I think this conversation Carlson and Nye had was healthy and I appreciate they have it.  It's a conversation I don't think you see on many other news networks and I think it is important, even if it makes Carlson look stupid.",

Over and over. Guys like this seem to thrive on the fact that the speaker keeps trying to speak even while being interrupted, so that the interviewer can continue to react and interrupt to the snippets the speaker is giving. I wonder if bill literally just fell silent and stared after every single interruption, and literally waited each time until the other guy stopped speaking if it would have been more jarring for this interviewer. \n\nI\u2019ve started doing this with people who interrupt a lot in normal conversations. I stop speaking and when they finish saying their sentence that interrupted me I pause and stare, not for long but just a little longer than a normal natural pause. People seem to recognize the awkwardness and it forces the back and forth to slow down a bit.",

      "text": "I thought I hated tucker before... but this interview demonstrates how he deliberately sabotages a reasonable view so that anyone watching could be left misinformed.\n\nSo many things I could point out from the interview here, from \"science is extreme scepticism\" (it is not) to stupidly asking the same question when Nye clearly said beforehand that the rate of change would've been 15,000 years without humans, to now being decades or even years with humans.\n\nRepeatedly banging on about \"settled science\" does not equate to knowing the details down to precise figures as he tried to press Nye into. Lord, why hast thou forsaken us in company of this douchbag. Settled science means it is agreed upon, as in a consensus of the scientific community.\n\nThen he argued like a dim-witted buffoon, saying it is unknowable. In a sense yes, eg it is unknowable that Trump would lie in a given month of a particular year. But given data you can pretty much calculate the odds to say it was extremely likely. If he lies consistently every day, of every week, of every month for years... you \"know\" he would lie on a given month in the future.\n\nAnd there's the classic \"I'm just asking a question\". No, you are the shit stain of a skid mark on the underpants of human society. Pretending to be the devil's advocate is not nearly as commendable as you want it to be when you are disingenuous in your \"questioning\".\n\nThis man is nothing but a turd!",

We might be able to slow or even stop this rise in carbon dioxide and methane. We might not. Scientists use models that describe a range of conditions that could happen. We don\u2019t know exactly which conditions will prevail. The local weather patters will change. Where we grow food now will most likely not be viable farm land later. What if the best place to grow food is now in our most populated areas with little to no farmland available. What if countries that can grow food can only grow enough for their populations. Who gets to die when the food wars come. \n\nLook at storms, when Hurricane Katrina came through a level 5 storm was considered a once in a lifetime storm. Then we had 4 or 5 storms since then at a level 5 most of which became 4\u2019s just before they hit. Tornadoes, always common in the US are getting stronger.\n\nEvery time the Earth has had a major climate disruption large animals suffer the most. We are large animals. Humanity most likely will not completely go extinct because of our technology but can you afford to be the one who survives. Why are you so certain you can survive? What happens if you are the group marked for removal because there are simply not enough resources to support everybody.",

It's just wordplay playing with the definitions of \"I\" and \"am\".\n\nThe reason why science can't predict with a 100% certainty whether or not the pen will fall is not because we haven't found the right words (axioms) to describe reality. That's not how science works or the real world. The pen won't magically fly away because we don't know the axioms of reality. However the pen might fly away if a bird picks it up and you can't control what birds do. You could try doing the experiment in a closed room and check the room for birds first but then how do yo control for wondering black holes? You can't. So if you repeat the experiment over and over again sometimes the pen won't fall. \n\nUnlike math and philosophy science isn't JUST fancy wordplay it has real life consequences.\n\nYeah sure the pen might fly away but that doesn't mean you should live your life dropping pens expecting them to fly away or that science is somehow invalid.\n\nI tought this was what you were talking about, sorry if I misinterpreted you.",

And committing a fallacy is even more atrocious in philosophy than in physics, since it's literally the ONLY thing you have to worry about. Not that it\u2019s easy or even simple, but it's the ONE mistake you can make.\n\nEdit: I forgot to specifically mention the \"scientifically proven\" vs \"mathematically/philosophically proven\". So scientific proofs aren\u2019t proofs, they can \"prove beyond reasonable doubt\", but since even deductive proofs in science are based on axioms that are just experimental data, they aren\u2019t the same thing. Science IS awesome and by FAR the best way to know about stuff, and has worked brilliantly for a long time. I DO in my daily life talk about scientific results as truths, because it's useless to consider them anything else, but in these situations it can be useful to know and aknowledge the differences.\n\nPS. Math is basically the same, since at the base lies axioms that are just definitions. How do we know 1+1 = 2? We defined 1+1 to be 2.",

Biden is the president the whole world wanted and hadn\u2019t let us down a jot. Leaving aircraft, munitions, drones and tanks to the taliban in a hasty retreat from Afghanistan was a complete win for the western world. \n\nIf Russia goes nuclear, I want Biden there to oversee the western alliances position. \n\nWe should all just look at leftist media, as they obviously don\u2019t lie. Let\u2019s not look for the truth somewhere in the middle, as many esteemed scholars from Greek and Roman history (not to mention Lincoln, Jefferson, Washington) have advised. u/Dinosauringg has spoke.

You pay more taxes plus health insurance.\n\nIt doesn't help to have the world's best Healthcare when not everyone in your own society can use it without getting themselves into debt. Tell one of your 500k homeless about how awesome your Healthcare is compared to ours.\n\nAnd lol, you just described how science work, good job American, seems your education system isn't as bad as your statistics show.\n\nYou were fine until Japan attacked you and you had to get involved, you tried to ignore the methhead like you ignore most things outside America.\n\nWell a big part of America didn't want to end slavery, and you didn't end it that very long ago either. Also you still have slavery in America, it's called your prison system. It's incredibly really, every aspect you break down about America is just fucked up and horrible in so many ways.\n\nMost imprissoned population in the world that works for pennies, 500k homeless, huge drug and opiod problem, no guaranteed 5 week paid vacation, no minimum wage of 18$ an hour, no Paid parental leave for both parents, no free school with free school food, no guarantee housing and income for people without work, no guarantee paid sick leave. I mean I can go on and on.and you still pay more taxes and then pay for extra expenses I get through my taxes. LOL!!!

However, once the sulphates drift back down to the surface, the cooling effect of volcanoes goes away.

The bucket is going to fill up with water, because that is already happening. You just made it go *way faster,* and you are 100% of the reason that it went *way faster.* That is what is happening with climate change. Human activity is 100% of the reason that the \"bucket\" is \"filling up\" *way faster.*\n\nThe answer to the question \"how much water would be in the bucket right now if humans weren't around\" cannot be 100% proven, but it has been explained what is *most likely* to be the case.\n\nI genuinely do not understand what you don't get about this. Humans are 100% of the reason the bucket is filling up faster than it naturally would, the amount of extra water in the bucket is *significant,* although it is impossible to definitely prove *exactly* how much more water is in the bucket because of humans.

And I am on your side regarding climate change and the election results. \n\nI have mentioned before I am not an American but do like to keep informed of what\u2019s happening in the US for a few reasons, not least because when America sneezes the whole world catches a cold. \n\nWorking for an American investment bank also means I have to take a little more care about keeping myself informed than the average person. \n\nI watch news from both left and right, and try to find the truth somewhere in between when your remove biases. I think Trump was an idiot, and I think Biden is senile. Neither covered the US in glory. \n\nOne of the issues that I\u2019ve taken to heart recently is the issue of trans-women being involved in traditional women\u2019s sports. This Lea Thomas situation has bother me as it seems to have bothered so many. I see it not as an anti-trans situation (she is a woman) but one of fairness. It\u2019s not about trans people, it\u2019s about all people. \n\nSo when I watched this:\n\n[here](https://youtu.be/I3Jmv0vZvJ4)\n\nWhile not agreeing with everything Tucker says, I think many of his points are logical and food for thought. While I support everyone\u2019s rights to live in safety and to have any opinions they wish to have, we have to draw the line somewhere when it comes to fairness. Boxing and other fighting arts have had weight classes for this exact reason for many years. \n\nNow some people hate him, therefore everything he says is wrong and he should be deplafformed. I disagree with this 100%. \n\nFor free speech, I\u2019ll defend anyone to have any opinion and express it, even the wrong one. Most of the most outlandish ones  just gets ignored anyway, which is an ideal outcome. \n\nWhile not being active politically (I live in japan and their politics are just too baffling to me) I like to have the full range of information available to me and make my own mind up with an educated and well informed stance. I don\u2019t attack people for believing things that are contrary to my own beliefs, and I am open to calm and rational debate. I am open to change my mind if I see that I am wrong. \n\nSorry for the essay my friend, but you asked some good questions and I felt like i wanted to converse with you much more than the people who just threw insults instead of showing how the opposite is true.",

Whether we got here by human actions or if this is due to some other natural cause is worthy of debate, and there are much better points to bring up than \"oh but there's cities underwater.\" For instance, climate has changed drastically in the span of decades during the last ice age (not the current ice age we're in right now) and scientists don't have a clear answer as to why, though they have many strong theories. Clearly it wasn't humans before humans existed. \n\nClimate scientists have a lot of evidence to support the theory of human-caused climate change. What are the other theories?

Two people could just throw that claim back and forth to seem valid.  You also can't just go the air and say \"the evidence is overwhelming\" (which is pretty much a cliche rhetoric phrase at this point for the left and right) as a reason for people to believe you.  I don't get Bills decision to show up on Fox considering this.  If he wanted to convince Fox viewers of his stance, he would have considered the time he had and would have thought about what significant info about the issue he could fit into the segment that would be convincing beforehand.\n\nI also can't take talk of respect for scientific skepticism from someone who's a devout christian.

The facts are as follows:\n\n- The average temperature on earth is increasing exponentially over a period of decades.\n\n- There are only two other ways for the average temperature to naturally increase in this way and at this rate; an significant increase in volcanic activity (or other geological activity that causes natural carbon deposits to open up) or a significant meteorite impact. Neither of these have been observed over the past 250 years to the degree that could constitute such a change.\n\n- The only other factor that could lead to this pattern is human activity which has increased exponentially since 1790.\n\n- Everything in our data suggests this climate crisis to be the cause of human activity. \n\nSaying that the climate crisis is mostly natural is like saying Twinkies are made mostly of natural ingredients, it not true and it's not constructive.",

      "text": "Honestly the only good answer to that asinine question (what is the exact impact?) would have been a semester length course in statistics for dummies: We can't say the exact impact humans have had because that is a population proportion. We estimate the population proportion by sampling. Each sample provides a sample mean and sample standard deviation. These numbers are used to estimate the population mean within a margin of error (which depends on your desired level of confidence). This provides a confidence interval (or range of values in which the population mean has a [insert percentage confidence here] chance of being). The larger the percentage confidence, the larger the necessary margin of error, as the confidence approaches 100% the margin of error diverges to infinity (in the limit). This is the nature of the central limit theorem and the normal model and is necessary to reflect the fact that extreme outliers do occur with extraordinary rarity (and also the fact that unforseen circumstances could impact the viability data of a given study). As the number of studies increases, the resulting margin of error at each confidence level decreases (the interval where the population mean lies gets smaller). That interval will never, I repeat never, converge to a single value for any fixed level of confidence and will never be finite at the 100% confidence level. Instead, scientists pick a desired level of confidence (say I want to be 99.9% confident that the impact of human beings has accelerated the growth in average temperature disproportionately to any prior point in history -- this can be tested by adapting a null hypothesis that current climate changes mirror past changes, then determining the likelihood of all prior studies producing their published results given that null hypothesis. If the likelihood is less than 0.1% then we can reject the null hypothesis with 99.9% certainty and adapt the alternative hypothesis that we have in fact accelerated climate change disproportionately to any prior point in world history -- the actual data would easily support the given example and in fact even higher degrees of certainty).  That is the nature of scientific (and statistical) inquiry and understanding. Tucker's question is that of a manipulative debater seeking to abuse the fact that intelligent people recognize variability in data and cannot EVER settle on a single number for the true population proportion (without collecting 100% of existing data -- which would require an army of time machines and billions of years) or even a range of numbers at 100% certainty (in this case for the exact percentage impact of humans on the climate). This is taught in any intro stats class. Explaining this live with an angry bigot berating and interrupting you every 8 seconds is a non starter. My compliments to Bill for keeping his cool.",

All the big shot elitist socialists from Obama to Pelosi to Bill Gates and so on -- own ocean front properties. They don't seem too concerned about sea levels rising. This man and all who mimic him are complete and utter liars.",

A half-hour of being trashed for being a \"liberal\" and other typical talking points, talked over and yelled at to \"Shut up!\" by O'Reilly, only for old BJ Hunnicutt to actually be wished \"Best of luck\" by Bill in the end when he kept his cool and refused to let O'Reilly get to him.\n\nEvery one of these Murdoch talking heads know exactly what they are doing: engaging in theater, an empty, performative nonsense they somehow get paid six figures for. \n\nWhy does anybody think Chris Wallace is on CNN now, or Shepard Smith is on CNBC? Oh, that's right: If you actually thought about that, you'd have done the research to know that Carlson has made quite a self-enriching career out of deceiving conservatives who can't be bothered to educate themselves since CNN allowed him to butt heads with Michael Kinsley on *Crossfire*.\n\nThis will be Sean Hannity's career terminus as well. He just doesn't know it yet because his audience, Carlson's audience, opened the door for such fools to be taken seriously in 2016 by shoving their false idol Trump down our throats. \n\nIn most other cultures throughout history, such an audience at least had the awareness to know they had outlived their usefulness to their family, tribe or village. Even the Roman philosopher/politician Cicero knew how to make an end for himself.\n\nIn America, they are actually rewarded for being completely ignorant of this with FoxNews and its hellspawn, which have virally infected an entire obstructionist political party. Love Bill Nye, but what does he hope to accomplish in the face of such unprecedented pollution?",

That being said Tucker needs to give Bill a little more room to talk and use less framing devises.  His interruption timer was BRILLANT and that is most definitely point Mr. Nye.\n\n1.  Is climate change happening?  Absolutely, without doubt.\n2. How much of climate change is being caused by humans.  Depending on various sources this is 50%-90%.  If you want to break it down by country the US is not the worst offender and no matter what it does if the rest of the world doesn't do it as well nothing will change enough to matter.\n3. What will the effect be?  This is more debated then most people think by credible experts.  There has been everything from global cooling to catastrophic floods by the late 2000's (the decade, not the the century/millennium).  Not saying those ideas are mainstream but experts have come to those conclusions showing that even they aren't sure.\n4. Can we prevent it?  Probably not, but definitely not unless the entire world gets on board and works together.  That will never happen.\n5. What should we do about it?  If we can't prevent it our only options are to adapt to it.  Luckily if government stays out of the way people are pretty good at adapting.\n\nIt's so frustrating to see the side that is mostly correct be so bad about how to handle the problem and the side that is mostly wrong come to a conclusion that would probably work better despite them being wrong.",

Though I would agree that nuclear energy is the best option as of now. And by the way, China easily wins the #2 spot for most green house emissions, it\u2019s only recently begun significantly cracking down with green policies.\n\nCorporatism is indeed a facet of capitalism, this is a fact, even though the common talking point is that they\u2019re somehow point is two separate things. Capitalism naturally becomes corporatism as corporate interests invade government. The a nature of capitalism as its stands in America is allowing corporations to dominate the market in any way that allows them to maximizes profit, which includes lobbying for legislation that for legislation is hat is detrimental to the environment. Which they do. When you have a system that will devolve into power in the hands of a few individuals (i.e. capitalism) this is the inevitable outcome. The whole power corrupts argument empirically doesn\u2019t work here when corporations are literally taking advantage of the government\u2019s influence. I agree, the government needs to start giving corporations handout and start cracking down on them. Capitalism and the state are naturally intertwined with another, there is no such thing a completely free \u201cfree market\u201d. The issue is when the state becomes completely beholden to trying to maintain to maintaining a favourable investment for business owners. Which it has. Capitalism is a system in which the means of production are privately owned and used for profit, regardless of what role the state takes.\n\nMore regulation may result in an increase of pricing for the now, but some local benefits would be for example that people\u2019s local water supply isn\u2019t ruined by fracking sites not being properly contained. But the long-term consequences are what\u2019s most important here. Many people are, and for good reason, concerned by the short-term impact that major lifestyle changes would have on poorer communities, but this is literally a matter of life or death on existential scale. That\u2019s why social policies put in place like increasing the minimum wage and paying works decently rather than allowing business owners to exploit them, is necessary to mitigate the damage that free market capitalism perpetuates. Without a finical offset, these people are going to stay poor either way. More regulation would serve to unburden the working class by reducing the extent by which capital owners would be able to take advantage of them.\n\nIf we need to hurt a little bit now, or corporations substantially, in order so that humanity doesn\u2019t hurt *a lot* later on, then that\u2019s the price that we need to pay. Corporations produce more carbon emissions than everyone else combined, so the last thing that we should do is pretend that their own volition is what\u2019s going to solve the problem. Instead, we need to reduce the damage via regulation.\nAgain, I agree that nuclear is the best option, where we disagree is that this idea that the free market is going to magically solve itself because the wealthy are just so good. It\u2019s a myth, just like trickle down economics. I\u2019m a poli-sci student, obviously I don\u2019t have all of the answers, but I know enough of the common conservative taking points about why free market capitalism is such a beautiful thing and how it\u2019s going to fix all of society\u2019s problem. It isn\u2019t.",

There currently running a genocide, I don't know what else will show how little a countries government cares about anything but it's own power.  I would argue there #1 in the first world as I am not sure if India truly qualifies as a #1 world country.\n\nWhat is the alternative to capitalism.  You have to suggest an alternative or you are just complaining with no possible solution.  I listed why I believe something will work.  What system do you believe will work and why?\n\nYes the means of production are privately owned.  The alternative is they are publicly owned.  Which means owned by the state.  Instead of a decentralized network you have a centralized one which can only work through tyrannical rule.\n\nIncreasing the minimum wage does nothing.  The base of all costs is labor.  If you increase the minimum wage you just increase the cost of goods on a slight delay.  The reason major companies push for it is to price small business out of the market.\n\nIf you don't want to be poor go get an education.  I don't inherently mean collage, unless you want to be something like a physician or an accountant it's pretty worthless (not that those are bad).  Master electricians make bank and most places will train people from the ground up, it takes years but mastering something usually dose.  As a poly sci student you are pretty fucked tbh.  I had students with your major applying to take jobs as a delivery driver for $14 and hour.  With the ability to look up what people make with what degrees easily why would you ever take that major.  Even if you want to go to law school you could have done something that gives you a fall back.\n\nCorporations produce carbon emissions making things that we want to buy.  If we didn't want to buy them they wouldn't make them.  Fracking is safer now then it was.  I am not advocating for 0 regulations either.  But I would rather start with pumping oil out of Alaska either way.\n\nIt's not about the wealthy being good.  It's about creating a system where it's possible to generate enough disposable income to increase your economic standing.\n\nThough at least we can agree that a good start is getting money out of politics.  Problem is that won't happen without a populist blitz on the system.  That will cause some issues but hey as you said \"If we need to hurt a little bit now then that\u2019s necessary\"",

My point that I\u2019m trying to make is that corporations are the ones who got us into this mess and that it\u2019s empirically laughable to think that their interest lies in public. Their interests lies in what makes profit, which in the case of those who deal with fossil fuels is to extract as many natural resources as possible. You\u2019re right in regards to how fucked up China is, and that the current labour market is more difficult for my generation, which I\u2019m aware of, it\u2019s our current disconnect is the role that corporations play in this. Which is why I say that more regulation is necessary here, as the effects of societal degradation has shown. If private owners want to spend more on nuclear and create job opportunities that necessitate economic growth, then more power to them. It\u2019s in the name of capital, but it\u2019s an investment for what\u2019s arguably the cleanest solution and what the future is most likely going to rely on. It\u2019s sure as Hell better than furthering destroying our atmosphere with carbon emissions. I\u2019m not saying that the state should absorb capitalistic structures, all that I\u2019m saying is that the government should acknowledge how they\u2019ve prioritized corporate interests over the health of the general public and recalibrate their current position (0 regulation isn\u2019t even possible). Because as of right now, corporations are the biggest threat to humanity. That was my point.",

However I stand by my point that I don't see that changing in anyway until money is out of politics and I don't see any way to do that without a populist blitz.\n\nYour not wrong that every business first interest is profit.  The issue is incentivizing them to get things done cheaper in other countries as opposed to incentivizing them to do things state side.  Personally I am for higher import taxes.\n\nThe government tends to mess up any business it touches though.  When they got involved in student loans the price for collage soared.  When they subsidies something it becomes more expensive overall and forces taxpayers to pay for other peoples purchases.\n\nThe regulation and government pandering to fear is why we don't see more nuclear power.  I am all for it but until its built we need to pump the oil and frack.  All for building it ASAP, but reality is realty.\n\nThis is why I am for government pulling back and create a free market that isn't meddled with by government.  No to big to fail, no needless regulations, no jail for victimless crimes and no minimum wage.  Norway removed it's minimum wage and it made unions necessary to negotiate effectively privatizing a workers rights industry making it free to the taxpayer.",

I work in health care, I specialize in manufacturing and compounding medications.  Problem with universal health care is that it has worse health outcomes when controlled for by lifestyle.\n\nOur current system can be fixed with two moves and 0 net regulations.\n\nFirst remove the barrier that prevents insurance from selling across state lines.  Competition is good for the consumer.  BCBS of AL is different from BCBS of FL.\n\nSecond is a change to 80/20.  Currently most insurance pays 80% of procedures.  What this means is if they \"negotiate\" a price down that negotiation is part of that 80%.\n\nSo if a physician has a procedure that for the sake of argument should charge $2,000 and they charge $2,000 most insurance won't want to work with them as they don't want to pay $1,600 for the procedure.\n\nBut if the physician charges $10,000 to the uninsured and $2,000 to the insured then the insurance company has to pay $0 and will give the physician some preferential rates on smaller things.\n\nThis is why health care costs so much.  Also why some physicians will negotiate from uninsured price if you don't have insurance.  So long as it's not the listed or standard rate they can get away with it.",

You let tucker finish saying everything he wants to say and you never talk over him and you clearly answer each question as precisely as you can. Even when you need to get your point across, you need to listen as much as you can and prevent this talking over each other nonsense. Controlling the discussion is far more important than the fact that you are right, no one is listening to you whilst they're talking. Let tucker absolutely and conclusively finish, and make your answers constantly remind tucker that you're talking about the exact  question he asked. Refer back to it repeatedly. Too often, Bill starts elaborating before tucker has the answer he wants, and this allows Bill to cut in. The way you talk can easily prevent this",

To understand why this is so idiotic, consider the fact that glass is totally opaque to infrared.\n\nTo verify this, get an IR sensor/camera, such as one that electricians and others use to look for hotspots. A lot of electrical stores sell them or you may be able to borrow one from an electrical company or maybe someone who surveys houses for heating losses.\n\nAnyway - point the heat sensor at a glass door with no one on the other side of it. Make note of what you see.\n\nHave someone walk into the field of view on the other side of the glass door but close to the door. Make note of what you see.\n\nThen have someone walk in front of the glass door on your side of the glass door and again, close to the door. Make note of what you see.\n\nMagic - You can't see the person on the other side of the glass door but you can see the person on your side of the glass door.\n\nThe only way to pass heat through glass with infrared energy is to heat the glass up by absorbing all the infrared energy (called radiation heating) and have the heat transfer to the interior through conduction and a little bit of infrared radiation from it's resulting increased temperature. The gas on the inside is not mostly heated by the infrared energy from the heat lamp and the resulting increase in infrared radiation on the inside is little more than ambient infrared radiation unless the glass gets extremely hot to the point of almost melting.",

The fact that none of them have looked up the easily discoverable statistics demonstrates that these commenters are exhibiting the same cognitive dissonance that Bill had originally brought up.  \n\nYou are not scientists, please shut the fuck up.  You're not helping, you're giving climate change deniers more ammunition because you STILL haven't answered Tucker's question.  One possible answer is: the statistical likelihood that humans are responsible for the recently measured acceleration in the Earth's warming is 5 standard deviations or 99.999% according to a recent summary article in Nature ([USA today article with link to the summary article.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/26/global-warming-99-9999-percent-chance-humans-cause/2994043002/)\nThis article may have been published after this interview, but there are others that are certainly before this interview with 95% or greater likelihood.\n\nThis is just one such analysis, there are others.  After 5 minutes of searching, the lowest threshold I've found is 95% likelihood.\n\nAs it turns out, it is an easily answerable question.  I don't understand why Bill would take this interview without doing this basic research.  Oh, actually I do: he's not a scientist!  Stop pretending like he is.  He's not even a good science communicator, as this interview shows.  \n\nIf I asked a professor that specializes in climate science this same question, and she went off about the economic impacts of climate change, not addressing my question, I would have a similar reaction to Tucker.\n\nI am not defending Tucker, if he actually wanted the answer to this question to share with his viewership, he could have interviewed an actual climate change scientist.  He wanted to bring on someone who is also justifying scientific conclusions with belief rather than statistical evidence.  And he absolutely accomplished that, and in doing so gave a lot of ammunition for climate change deniers.  Which is the same as what many of the top comments are doing.\n\nPlease, stop making \"science\" your religion.  You clearly don't know how it works.",

We can only look at the scale of human interaction with the climate through a lens of a few hundred years (of recorded history), yet are aware of the past \"norms\" of climate from examination of fossils, paleontology and geology. Maybe the extent of affect is 5%. Maybe it's 80%. Maybe it's 2\u2070. Maybe it's 5\u2070. I feel like the whole point of \"questioning\", or \"debating\" is to avoid fixing anything. If \"there's no debate that humans are affecting climate change\", but we can't come to a solid answer of \"degree\", then we'll fall to our own insistence of arguing to avoid any resolution...",

Changes in that, coupled with changes in surface activity (ie volcanic eruptions), have caused shifts in the climate. Currently, the Earth is positioned in such a way that previous patterns suggest the Earth should be cooling. But, because of carbon emissions like CO2 being the highest (300 vs 418 ppm) ever recorded in the last million years, we're warming. So, I would agree that 100% of the current climate trends are caused by humans. [source](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/)",

But come on Bill, you know what the actual debate is about. \n\nI work with some very intelligent people in their respective fields (I work in higher education - specifically technology for me). I know scientists, doctors, medical assistants, psychologists, engineers, etc from both political parties. The debate isn't about whether climate change exists or not. The debate I hear most often is about \"what we do about it\". My more left leaning colleagues push for government oversight often arguing \"for such a monstrous task we need the government at the front of it\" while my more right leaning colleagues say \"no the government sucks at everything it gets involved in and we should put our faith in the private sector.\"\n\nBoth arguments are pretty reasonable from what I hear and see. The middle ground they seem to agree on is the idea that the government should be involved enough that it gives incentives for the private sector to tackle these problems while having penalties for big corps that increase the damage of climate change. \n\nIdk guys everyone seems to be very strongly opinionated on the internet but when you go out and talk to actual intelligent individuals from both parties they all seem a lot more receptive and rational in their debates.",

Yet, he is pretending not to know what Tucker is getting at and acting like his question isn\u2019t even coherent. It makes Tucker so flustered he loses his ability to clarify the exact reason why he\u2019s asking the question or to coherently call Bill out for it.\n\nHe just starts yelling, interrupting, and personally attacking\u2026 which is really sad.

We can just say that he's a political fuck nut who wastes people's time, because his frozen meals on wheels shit he got  prolly will get out paced by amazon foods or some shit and he knows it. He's only good at listening but ends up looking like he's taking a massive dump every time he asks a question.\n\nNo I mean most people ask for a specific number when it comes to most science, but with such a massive scale there's way too much room for error. And not to mention varied sets of data for interpretation. And if any errors pop up we'll only get the \"Huuuuurrrr we were right this whole tiiiime LETS GO BRANDON\". So, the best response is that the question has no real answer. Just studies. Lots and lots of studies. They all point to the world being on fucking fire. Shit the fucking ground is litterally exploding and perma frost in the tundra from the north is melting. That alone should be enough evidence. But people are retarded as fuck. I thought that every one had at least AN education, but for real some people just need their hands held to the very end. They voted for TRUMP my dude. We watched people kill themselves by ignorance through COVID. Someone genuinely thinks that the US federally legalized anal sex. These people are fucking stupid as bricks.

Then they come with a new hypothesis, test it, and gather more evidence. They do this over and over and over again until they have enough data to form a conclusion. \n\nI understand this perfectly well. I also understand that they have had to retract every single published claim that they have made to date with the singular exception of the current claims. Every. Single. Last. One. At absolute best, their evidence and conclusions should be thrown completely out and restarted from scratch every few years because the narrative will be something completely different\n\n>\nYou can\u2019t test a changing system and expect the same answer every time. That\u2019s like measuring the gas in your car when you first fill it up and then assuming it\u2019s full for the next 300 miles. In this case, things are getting worse much faster than they originally thought.\n\nThat's crazy because things aren't even anywhere near as bad as was predicted at any point since these doomsday predictions started\n\n>The argument hat it would be too expensive is ludicrous. \n\nEven the most hawkish of the climate alarmists admit they have no viable models that would not result in a significant reduction in the standard of living for the vast majority of all human beings on earth just to slow warming by a couple degrees a century. That's not anywhere near significant enough a result to constitute cutting global energy production by 90-95%, which is what it would take",

For *decades* it's always been taught for cardiopulmonary resuscitation it's ABCs (Airway, Breathing, and Circulation). Now it's been changed to CABs, and us not knowing this earlier could have prevented people from being saved and prevented unimaginable poverty. That early and efficient circulation of the already oxygenated blood in the body would suffice for the time being until an airway is obtained, and keeping the circulation primed has a higher patient outcome.\n\nIt's just funny how Climate Science is wrong, to people like you. But any other field of Science, you'll ignore. Paleontologists said dinosaurs had scales, turns out they were wrong. We know the planet is getting hotter and we know the oceans are rising. What's the cause? Something we can measure and study in the air, perhaps? Or the rise of sea levels? You're ignorant, that's pretty much it. Environments don't change every few hundreds of years, never have. It's ironic that that has started after the industrialization of mankind and clearing massive amounts of land has a strong correlation with climate change.....",

Stating that everyone has a bias in the way they view and present things doesn't in any way mean that there aren't objective truths that can be discerned, it just means you have to recognize that that bias exists in everyone and think critically about all of the information provided and verify it's veracity \n\n>Healthcare is also a science and is constantly changing, and sometimes we're wrong after so many years with a treatment\n\nBy \"healthcare\" I take it you actually mean medical care? Yeah obviously as we progress technologically we get better information. No one is disputing that. No one is disputing that climate change exists either. Your arguments sound nice and well put together but they address a point that no one has even begun to make and doesn't address any point that's actually been made thus far. It's hilariously ironic that you call me ignorant yet you can't even discern the argument that's actually being made",

And yes, you are ignorant because my comment was an example of something that has their issues and times of being wrong, a lot, and people just go with the flow. It's hilarious you're unable to discern this. That's how examples work. But once it's climate change - you have to think about the eCoNoMy. \n\nThe economy isn't going anywhere. But people's investments are going to go away years down the road strictly due to climate change. So you're worried about economic problems *today*? You wonder why housing insurance companies are leaving Florida? Because they're loosing money from paying out people for floods. But you know, climate change isn't real and people have political reason to live in their own self worldly delusions.\n\n>By \"healthcare\" I take it you actually mean medical care?\n\nNope.

What we know is how it changed since our impact began to be felt. But that interviewer would never accept that and would only bash the scientific community. Because he never questioned anything in good faith. And you know that student you expect to ask this question in a classroom? He would accept the answer and do other questions with curiosity.

For all we know if we didn\u2019t start burning fossil fuels and building the way we have a volcano may have exploded, covered the earth is ash, as given us an ice age. It\u2019s literally impossible to predict when the variables are every single molecules movement on earth. Think I\u2019m exaggerating? The movement of atoms *is* heat so they are very very closely linked (the movements of atoms and the heat of the globe). It\u2019s impossible to answer your question, no matter how simple it seems.\n\nEdit: realized I forgot to explain how we know we\u2019re changing it. We can see the gasses that we are producing hanging around in the atmosphere. Those gasses trap heat. We can see the change in temperature (approximated) from before we started burning these oils and gasses and the change after. Once we get to about the 1800s it speeds up. A LOT. That\u2019s how we know. Also, according to the ground (you can see history, especially of the climate, in rocks) the earth has never seen this type of changing of local and global climates. Hell, I\u2019ve lived in one place for about 11 years and it\u2019s changed so much! We used to have blizzards and snows every winter, now we barely get below freezing.\n\nAnyway, hope you have a nice day",

I get Bill\u2019s POV on the Earth heating up at a more rapid rate but I\u2019m personally not convinced on man made climate change. I\u2019m still open minded and he makes a good point that people\u2019s world view may be creating a bias but that works on both sides of the isle. \n\nWe can\u2019t deny that climate policies have been bankrupting the west. Shipping industry overseas to countries with little regulations doesn\u2019t help \u201cclimate change\u201d assuming its 100% man made. I\u2019m from Pittsburgh and have seen the direct impact of \u201cthe grand strategy\u201d under Nixon. Please google the grand strategy since most don\u2019t know of it. \n\nFollowing that we had carter give up the Panama Canal which in turn got bought by China + many other trade policies like NAFTA, TPP, etc\u2026  \n\nI\u2019m not even saying man made climate change isn\u2019t real but it\u2019s worth having the debate at which impact we have + is it really going to end humanity as they claim. \n\nThe only real solution to ending climate change \u201cassuming it\u2019s real\u201d would be to depopulate the world by 50% minimum, and go back to living primitively. Electric vehicles don\u2019t make sense due to the toxicity of mining cobalt, nickel, etc. solar panels are mined, and wind energy is horrible, and creating electricity produces carbon.",

Or do we just live it up while we still can and do however much damage to the planet as is economically convenient? If we're barreling towards are demise either way, what's the point, right?\n\nI think we should focus our efforts on preparing for a post-industrial world. You're right in that we would have to severely scale back global power consumption in order to possibly mitigate climate change to any consequential extent. And if we don't slow down any, we'll just be worse off when our physical and social infrastructures fail due to the effects of climate change. We're talking storms, blights, border breakdowns, global shipping stoppages, power grid failures, uprisings, anarchy, libertarian dreams coming true, nuclear waste abandonment, and pretty much anything else you might imagine happening in a corny apocalypse movie. \n\nWe can prepare society to function when those catastrophes start happening. We need to invest in renewable energy infrastructure that we can actually maintain without using fossil fuels in any part of the process. Phase out the use of planes and ships, unless you can figure out how to make those run on the cleanest of clean energy. Manufacturing needs to come back to the US big time. Scale down consumerism, focus only on manufacturing/selling products that are sourced sustainably and domestically. Improve mass transit infrastructure that can be maintained and used using only renewable/clean energy in the future. \n\nFor instance, I am all for building the hyper rail bullet train whatever system. I think it's even fine to use fossil fuels in the process of building it, because there's no other way for us to get the materials and do the actual building of the thing. But we have to be able to maintain it long-term without any use of fossil fuels anywhere in the process. \n\nWe can maintain civilization if we just prepare in advance. Even if every country all over the world meets their targets for mitigating climate change, we are all going to be facing a very different world as the climate continues to warm. Shut up about whether it is man made or completely natural. Greedy motherfuckers are going to milk every last dime out of fossil fuels and factory farming until their very last breath. Their money won't mean shit when we transition into a post-industrial world. It's certainly worth it to try and stop them, but we shouldn't be focusing every last bit of energy we have into getting people to stop fucking up the planet. We need to focus on how we are going to survive as a species going forward. Not to say we shouldn't keep trying to mitigate climate change. It just shouldn't be the main focus of our conversations at this point.",

          "text": "Let me dumb this down for you: If I asked a panel of the world's top surgeons exactly how much blood someone would have to lose before they die they couldn't answer. They couldn't answer for 2 reasons; first all such statistics (guesses at true 'population' averages) come in ranges which vary depending on the sample or set of samples. Second, the size of those ranges approaches unreasonable extremes (infinity or all depending if the substance, like blood is finite) as the level of desired certainty reaches 100%. It is for this reason that scientists are NEVER, I repeat NEVER certain of anything. Here is reality: There is a greater than 99.99% chance that human beings have had an observable impact on the ACCELERATION of temperature change on this planet. That means that there is a greater that 99.99% chance that we have fundamentally changed the pattern of climate  change that has existed since before the time of the dinosaurs. Since scientists cannot pinpoint the EXACT amount of change (because that's not how statistics works or ever has worked) you choose to assume that they know nothing and humans aren't impacting warming. It's an unfathomably stupid and illogical argument.\n\nIn reality (not wherever you live) there are many things that are unsettled in climate science: exactly how much impact (WELL ABOVE ZERO) have humans had? What effect will the fundamental changes in acceleration of climate change have in the long term? (will they just accelerate the next ice age? Will they change the carbon cycle all together and make the planet uninhabitable? Will our planet find a way to adapt and offset them all together (unlikely but certainly possible)? Is there anything we can do to reverse or control the trend and make outcomes predictable again?). What is the expected cost of offsetting human caused climate change in the short term and (should/are) we as a society willing to pay those costs so future generations can benefit (and if so, how much of those costs?). These are real questions that are actively debated by educated people. The question of if humans are having a huge impact is LONG settled. \n\nImagine you got stabbed and the doctors decided to debate exactly how much blood you needed to survive instead of stopping the bleeding. Would the 'valid' criticism of their lack of knowledge surrounding your loss of blood be justified?",
