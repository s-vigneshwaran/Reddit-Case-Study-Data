      "text": "I remember a video some years ago where a feminist woman went walking about NYC to capture street harassment. It was mostly black men who did it (to their chagrin), and a lot of times the guys would tell the woman to smile, which to them is as bad as saying, \"I wanna eat that pussy!\" Their goal was to raise awareness and garner support for making catcalling a crime.\n\nThere were a lot of parody videos after that, some men did the experiment too and were cat called by women and gay men. Overall the message was that women were overreacting, and if any anti-street harassment legislation were enacted, it would mostly affect black men. \n\nThe issue is watered down when spoken of, feminists will conflate being followed with catcalling, or when the catcall is extremely sexual. Saying \"looking sexy today\" is not the same thing as saying \"8 inches is awaiting, princess.\" Just other behaviors not associated with catcalling and extreme examples that depict catcalling as some serious societal ill. Even trying to do cold approaches are considered catcalling and street harassment to these people.\n\nCatcalling when not overtly sexual is ok with me.",

I was first catcalled when I was 9y/o walking home from the bus stop after the school bus dropped me off. a few older guys (probably in their 20s) blew whistles and started commenting when I walked by. I was a literal child back then. Didn't even know the word 'sex' let alone 'sexual attention'. I never told anyone at home because I didn't know what happened in the first place. I felt weird/disgusted. Couldn't get it out of my head for a few days. I was able to move past it but never forgot the incident. \n\nin case you're wondering \"but what were you wearing??\" , I was wearing the school uniform i.e, trousers, shirt, sweater, school shoes.\n\nthis wasn't the last incident. many more followed after that. for A LOT of us (people who have been catcalled), it started before the age of 10. would you still tell us to \"stop whining and enjoy since you're getting attention from men\".  to add something to this, I'm a lesbian(not because of this incident, i already had crushes on girls since i was 4-5) I'm definitely not looking for attention from men.",

I was a literal child back then. Didn't even know the word 'sex' let alone 'sexual attention'. I never told anyone at home because I didn't know what happened in the first place. I felt weird/disgusted. Couldn't get it out of my head for a few days. I was able to move past it but never forgot the incident. \n\nin case you're wondering \"but what were you wearing??\" , I was wearing the school uniform i.e, trousers, shirt, sweater, school shoes.\n\nthis wasn't the last incident. many more followed after that. for A LOT of us (people who have been catcalled), it started before the age of 10. would you still tell us to \"enjoy since you're getting attention from men\" ?\n\nto add something to this, I'm a lesbian(not because of this incident, i already had crushes on girls since i was 4-5) so I'm definitely not looking for attention from men.",

So I view people doing that shit as civilians to me with the same aspect of a hardened criminal saying that. I think lots of women are so quick to play victim though and claim catcalling = flirting when that\u2019s not the case. Just to be clear when I say catcalling is gross I\u2019m referring to as I said, weird, nasty, unprompted sexual remarks that you\u2019d be ashamed to say in front of a judge.

      "text": "Women don't like being told \"smile\" because 1. That's no one's business if anyone smiles or not 2. Women are pressured to look and act a certain way just like men are pressured to look and act a certain way. When a man says smile he doesn't think about all the annoying pressure women deal with in their personal lives, just like a woman who tells a man to look more tough when it isn't necessary doesn't think about the annoying pressure he deals with in his personal life. \n\nAbout the catcalls and \"smile\" comments, women feel uncomfortable because they are physically weaker, more emotionally sensitive, and aren't as filled with horny testerone as men (nothing wrong with men being filled with it, just matters how you act on it) so they don't want all the attention usually. Men and women have biological differences, as I've explained, so to act like women should equally be into getting catcalled as men are is not realistic. So if you KNOW someone is uncomfortable with something, why do it to them? It usually shows one is power hungry if they keep doing things to people when they know they don't like it. If men don't like when women complain about certain things, should women say, \"It's not rape, it's just me talking, you should be thankful, stop telling us women to stop\"? No, women shouldn't complain (unless maybe it's something that personally effects the woman like a guy not doing his share of the chores that were agreed upon ). Men and women should try to stop doing things that bother each other. Isn't it good to respect boundaries? I'm moreso talking about the overt catcalling versus a guy just saying \"hello\" lol.\n\nAlso, when tons of guys are catcalling etc. what are we supposed to do, say thank you and get the number of all 100 men who said something to us? I can understand saying thank you to some but I mean there are too many guys to keep saying the same \"thank you\" over and over to and women usually don't want 100 strangers' phone numbers.\n\nI've had men say really stupid things to me when I was downtown at 19 years old. I was in an ice cream place and I ordered dark chocolate flavor. A black customer said, \"You like dark chocolate?\" He pointed to his body and said, \"You think you can handle *me*?\" That's very disrespectful, wasn't a simple hello. Another time I walked on a sidewalk downtown and a group of men waiting for the bus parted like the Red Sea with a line on either side of me. As I walked down the aisle of annoying ass motherfuckers, one guy said \"Look at her eyes!\" Another said, \"Look at her legs.\" Another, \"Look at her boots!\" Another, \"Look at her BOOBS!\" They all sounded overly mesmerized and I did not feel comfortable. Why do this to women? Btw, I was covered head to toe in an appropriate outfit that barely showed any cleavage. It's not like I had my ass cheeks hanging out of tiny shorts and a tiny shirt that bares my stomach and the upper half of my breasts. I'd hope most men can understand these things are worse than saying \"hello\" instead of thinking they're just as innocent (I know a lot of men understand, I'm not upset with the men here who already understand).",

I don't believe in equality, but I believe in respecting both sexes because I just said men and women should respect each other's boundaries. So you didn't comprehend what I was saying. \n\nNothing I said makes me a bigot because I didn't say women deserve special treatment. I said women should respect men's boundaries too, such as women should not complain as much. [Edit: I should have remembered to include that to me equal respect means women shouldn't assume a man wants to hear things like \"You like chocolate, you think you can handle me?\" or \"Look at his biceps!\" from an overly mesmerized stranger either.]\n\nYou're assuming I wouldn't mind a man saying those descriptive things to me if he were attractive. No, when I was trying to force myself to be bi and had gained some attraction to men I did NOT like when any attractive man said that stuff to me in public either and I wouldn't like it from a woman either. You are assuming women want to hear random sexual things from hot men and from knowing many bi/heterosexual women, they do NOT like any random men saying sexually suggestive things in public especially like \"Oh you like dark chocolate, you think you can *handle* me?\" and \"Look at her hair! Look at her legs! Look at her boots! Look at her BOOBS!\" A lot of women don't want these comments from overly mesmerized strangers. You sound as bad as a feminazi who believes all men want things that I know men don't want. \n\nMost women in public who wouldn't mind a man talking to them want *mutually respectful conversation* where a man isn't asking if the woman can *handle him sexually* or *announcing* to the public that she has nice breasts. They'd want a man to talk about nonsexual things such as if she's looking at a magazine the man *politely* comments on what she's reading then they start talking about other nonsexual things. Then when he *politely* says, \"You're very beautiful, would you like to get dinner sometime?\" (I'm not implying men have to pay or that woman can't ask a guy out) that is very different from men sounding overly mesmerized while asking sexual questions or announcing to other men, \"Look at her this! Look at her that!\" The language and tone of those overly mesmerized men was not one of mutual conversation or calm politeness. It's so bizarre to hear anyone assume most women would want an attractive stranger to act how the men treated me. From many women I've known, lots of sources from other people, the internet, and from what I've observed in public and at parties from sober and drunk heterosexual social interaction, your assumption is wrong about what most women want. \n\nAlso, I didn't say that saying \"smile\" was harassment so that's another thing you are misunderstanding.",

Don't know if you're referring to me, but I wasn't dressing or acting in a sexual way. I barely showed cleavage, so that was the only merely \"sexual thing.\" As for acting, I didn't act like anything, just regular minding my own business. Most days I wore tops that went up to my neck and I still got men acting overly mesmerized and saying stupid things. Even when I wore baggy clothes that were not fashionable at all. At that age, my face was gorgeous without make up and that's something I couldn't change but I sometimes wore baggy unfashionable clothes (and no make up) that went up to my neck and down my ankles to prevent sexual harassment (was one reason) yet men acted so perverted regardless. Even a business man in a suit and in an expensive car said \"Hey! Come heeere!\" with giant eyes and a slow creepy voice when I wore the baggy clothes/tennis shoes that hid my shape and that situation made NO sense. At that point especially, those particular men really are just dogs. [Edit: the business man also smirked all creepy and beckoned me with his finger. Total fucking creep. Some men are just creeps.]\n\nJust because I showed hardly any cleavage that day doesn't mean men can treat me disrespectfully just like how women who see muscular men in showy sleeveless shirts with muscular cleavage shouldn't say \"you like dark chocolate, you think you can handle me?\" or announce \"Look at his biceps!\" And just like women should control their overly emotional state by not giving attitude men don't wanna hear, men need to control their testosterone levels by not saying sexually disrespectful things. Equal respect. \n\nMy dad always says men should not treat women disrespectfully and calls men who treat women how I was treated \"scum.\" He criticizes men's behavior a lot. Even he knows how to be respectful, and he's a fucking masculine bodybuilder who used to be a criminal in the hood before marriage (and isn't proud of that last part) yet he's not the one making excuses for men. So if he can be more respectful than some men, I guess no man has an excuse. It's usually the more masculine men who know how to treat women well. I think this may show men who are the less respectful ones *and* the men who make excuses for those men are usually beta males. I've seen this pattern many times in different environments. \n\nNo I don't think every male-female interaction has a sexual undertone. I've seen attractive people in high schools, universities, jobs, public places, etc. talk to very unattractive people of the opposite sex just to socialize and build community. It sounds anti-male to assume men always have a sexual thing when talking to women. Sex is a big thing that can permeate various aspects of life, but not every single thing is about sex.",

And here again you try to equalise the genders.\n\nMen are the ones who approach women (while women look pretty and wait till someone approaches), I have friends who are very successful with women but I have never heard any of them being approached by a random lady down the road. Also as I said earlier, Men communicate overtly. Some men are tactless and some men are socially inept to understand time and the setting. \nI am not making excuses for anyone. Also eve-teasing is a punishable offense, and if you have been eve-teased, you can get legal recourse. \n\nBut this hashtag:metoo garb is over the top. I think there are many women on the face of the planet who would trade their places with you. Many would happily accept being called \"come here babe\" or \"your smile is pretty\", over being grapes, tortured, forced to wear burqas or restricted from formal schooling and child marriages as is prevalent in the rest of the world. Stop manufacturing problems. When men are not doing anything productive, they are labelled broke, dead beat, useless etc by the society. No one cares for them or respects them. Many men go through this - I'm sure no woman has experienced this either. But I have heard no man complain about his ordeal. I have heard no broke dude question why no woman respects him and gives him no sexual access. Men have accepted the hypergamous nature of women and we don't complain. However women cannot accept that men are in constant search of sexual access. They want attention and validation but don't want to be sexualised too.",

If men lack the respect and social skills to have a normal conversation and flirt politely, that is their problem. Just like if women lack the control over their emotional minds (generally speaking, I'm not saying all women are overly emotional) it doesn't give them the right to just yell and whine if they can't express their feelings in a controlled manner. [Edit: \"come here babe\" isn't as bad if done with a more polite, friendly, or humorous tone.]\n\nYour logic is saying that because the Middle East has terrible things then that means the West can get away with less bad behavior. What a lazy, entitled mentality. You are too blind to get that if a man can't approach a woman with respect and vice versa then they have NO class. Do you get it? Bad behavior means no class, no manners. If that's how you want to be or what you want to support, it's like saying \"other people are doing PCP everyday, so that means I can smoke meth twice a week\" without realizing that reveals how much you lack class and self-discipline. Both sexes need to exercise respect and self-restraint instead of acting so entitled and beyond reproach! \"Your smile is pretty\" is not bad and I thought I made that clear with my example earlier of how most women prefer to be approached. Most women would trade places with me? HAHAHAHA What male fantasy world are you living in?! I'm trying to give you the cold, hard truth that women are NOT as interested in the overt comments as much as men think. Maybe you don't, but a lot of men watch porn and those porn stars are not a realistic depictions of how women want men to act. If your friends got many women with overt comments then they probably scored HOES, not classy women. The women I've seen who like overt stuff are usually HOES.",

Obviously one  has to be tactful. I have never approached a woman as a \"friend\" with hidden intentions.

There are some guys who don't know how to approach women, and it is their fault. They pay the price too with. I don't see it as a huge problem that western privileged women need to cry and write paragraphs about.

Plus, what is the average American person going to do to help women in the Middle East? That's something mostly political figures, organizations, etc. with greater power would do. I hope women get help in the Middle East, don't get me wrong. Women in America have the right to address issues here too whether or not it's major. Men have worse problems than women yelling and complaining at them, but I still think women shouldn't yell and complain if that behavior isn't fitting for the situation. In other words, everyone should work toward bettering their behavior and treating people with respect regardless of what's going on halfway across the world.",
