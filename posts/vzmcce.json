He has plenty of flaws, just like all who have been president before him. But no where near as many flaws as joe the potato has. He was definitely the lesser of two evils both against killary and the potato. I didn't vote for him because he was way to full of himself. But I will in 2024, because I'm sick of the vile bullshit you democrats are willing to look past, and the fact that you assholes try to tell people what they are supposed to think and say. Which is exactly why Trump won in the first place. That and the indoctrination you people are doing to children. The democrats have become the party of pedophiles and simps. I will not stand with a party like that for any reason. I am an independent, but I will be voting republican in 2022, and 2024.",

I want him to resign, but I would not want him hanged most liberals wouldn't. That's the difference.\n\n\n>Btw why would the fbi label groups like the proud boys as domestic terrorists while antifa (actual domestic terrorists) aren't \ud83e\udd14,\n\nBecause they aren't. SOME media want to paint them as equals to make the whole \"both sides\" argument stick.  But they are not the same. BtW they were designited this under TRUMP. That is how bad they really are. Antifa isn't even a group, more like a loose adjective to various group. \n\n>Perhaps it's the same reason why they spied on Trump's campaign and gave the information to Hillary's campaign manager so they could leak the Russia collusion hoax.\n\nDude it's 2022. Everybody knows that it was not a hoax. All this are conservatives talking points 101. I know you are not smart enough to understand why you are wrong.

They are distinct ideologies.\n\nThe problem is both that people reduce politics to left and right, but it doesn't actually really exist in that way as different ideologies are entirely different goals. Left and right really only works as a spectrum within Liberalism. Because, up until the rise of the religious schism, Conservatives in the West were supporters of classical Liberal values. Conservatism is a very hierarchical ideology, thus allowing it to patch on top of other existing ideologies. So Conservatism and Classical or Right Wing Liberal became interchangeable as Conservatives supported Classical Liberal hierarchies. This meant that over time the Left-right spectrum of Liberalism had the right side labeled Conservative, which resulted in the left side being labelled Liberalism. \n\nWhat has happened recently is that between the growth of secularism and the growth of religious extremism, a wedge has formed between Right wing Classical Liberals and Conservatives. This has led to the recent re-evaluation of the word Liberal. As has the resurgent Socialist movement in America meant there is a free standing Socialist movement no longer dependent on finding common ground with left wing/ Welfare State Liberals. \n\nSo none of these labels or understandings are new. It is a more traditional and more accurate understanding of the words that is returning to prominence. \n\n(This is also why there is a growing inability to compromise. When the divide was Classical Liberals vs Welfare Liberals, there was still common ground provided by Liberalism. But now that there is three strong ideologies, common ground is lost.)",

A lot of them play both sides too. \n\nYou are right about the donations thing for the most part though.

It wasn't because they all of a sudden became anti-establishment. Yet, that's what you're arguing it IS because of, when you say the left became pro-establishment during the same period. When corporations agree with measures that medical and scientific experts ask people to follow, it's a broken clock being right for once. Not a sign that lemmings should all jump off the cliff in order to prove they're 'anti-establishment'. That doesn't prove anything remotely like that. It just proves they're anti-science.\n\n\nYour position that the ideology is just trying to make you believe it's popular also means the far right wing is the popular ideology yet you fail to explain why far right wing Christofascists believe they're the ones being persecuted then?",

It's so difficult to remember all of the horrible things bush did because they all seem to be trivial in comparison.\n\nAnd the second clip doesn't make me happy in any way. He was an elected official 3 times. Three fucking times. And I listen to him talk, and his reasoning and how he processed stuff and I'm reminded that people actually believed he should be in charge of something.\n\nHe's told it's not the law to swear on the bible, and he counter to that is trump did it. How could anyone listen to this person and think, \"yes, he's the one\"\n\nOur system is so utterly fucked.",

The first one\u2019s that the other guy that isn\u2019t Tucker Carlson introduces the segment by saying \u201cas our loyal fans know, Crossfire is all about left vs. white, black vs. white\u2026\u201d\n\nNow whether or not \u201cleft vs. white\u201d was intentional or a hilarious Freudian slip, why the HELL would he say \u201cblack vs. white\u201d right after \u201cleft vs. right\u201d?!\n\nThat just sailed right by in 2004. Imagine someone saying that today.\n\nWell, maybe not always. Republican Congresswoman Mary Miller introduced Trump at a rally last week by saying that the repeal of Roe v. Wade was a [\u201chistoric victory for white life,\u201d](https://youtu.be/QtdOAdmqqIY) directly referencing the Great Replacement, a neo-Nazi white supremacist conspiracy theory about Jews conspiring to eliminate the \u201cwhite race.\u201d That\u2019s what the tiki-torch-carrying neo-Nazis were talking about when they chanted \u201cJews will not replace us\u201d at the 2018 \u201cUnite the Right\u201d protest in Charlottesville.\n\nETA: Mary Miller is also the same Congresswoman who said during a campaign rally: \u201cHitler was right about one thing: whoever has the youth, has the future.\u201d Not exactly an isolated incident.\n\nOn a lighter note, about seven minutes into the segment, Jon Stewart said \u201c\u2026you\u2019re 35 years old and you wear a bow tie. And I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re not a smart guy, because those are not easy to tie\u2026\u201d\n\nTwo things happened after that interview/intervention: Tucker Carlson never wore another bow tie, and Crossfire got canceled.",

However, it's easy if you're disconnected (by poverty, lack of life experience from little travel, etc) to fall into a trap of social exchange with your audience which boils down to \"are we together or apart\". Less conservative comedy doesn't hold or work toward the premise that difference is necessarily a bad thing (on the contrary, it can be a great source for laughs without attacking anyone). More conservative comedy has difficulty stepping away from the [stratified social hierarchy that's a fundamental part of conservatism](https://www.psychologytoday.com/au/blog/mind-in-the-machine/201712/analysis-trump-supporters-has-identified-5-key-traits).\n\nIt stems from where on the spectrum the comedian (and audience) falls on the spectrum of openness to new experiences.",

Lets agree to disagree.  Conservative values have certainly been about traditional family roles, but it's as if you were suggesting that those on the left don't go through the very same things that conservatives go through on a daily basis.  \"Slice of life\" comedy is, in essence, something everybody can relate to.

That was my point.\n\n>I said politics is a broad umbrella so it's almost impossible for a comedian to do something that's absolutely non-political, particularly over the span of a career.\n\nTrue, but we were talking about slice of life type comedy as Jeff Foxworthy does.  I don't know if he's moved onto right-wing comedy, to my knowledge he hasn't.  I won't argue that Jeff Foxworthy has never said a single political thing in his comedy routine ever, because no doubt he has, but I won't label him a right-wing comedian unless he's actively doing standup with right-wing talking points.  Jim Breuer used to not focus on politics, and now he's very much a right-wing comedian.  \n\n>I'm sure you could find samples of a comedian narrating a story that wasn't highly political, but the more of any comedian's work you sample the less likely you're going to come across absolutely nothing involving politics at all.

As you pointed out, a comedian can do both.  There is nothing inherently right-wing about slice of life comedy in of itself, and that doesn't change if the comedian has also made some political humor in his career at some point.  Nor is making a single political humor joke 10 years ago and never again really fair to label a comedian as someone who primarily makes politically based jokes.  \n\nTo my knowledge, Jeff Foxworthy doesn't make political jokes but slice of life type humor.  So again, to reiterate, are the slice of life type jokes the reason for calling Jeff Foxworthy a \"right-wing\" comedian?  It seems an incredible stretch to me.",

If you want to say that it is, you should show in the way in which it is political\n\nJust how somebody reacts to your above example of a 'bump on the head' is going to tie into the person's worldview and politics. A hyper-individualist (which would correlate with the American right) might ignore that bump even as it swells and discolors, a person with a positive view of collectivism is going to have no problem not only putting on a bandage but going to a clinic when the bleeding doesn't stop after a few minutes of pressing toilet paper against the possible cut.\n\nJeff Foxworthy recounted his kidney stone once and he detailed how he prayed and screamed in pain but avoided going to the hospital.

You're the one claiming that and I'm tiring of you inventing something I didn't say and then demanding I defend it.\n\nTake a step back and look at some more distant comedy. I'm a particular fan of vaudeville comedy (in my case, for the skill of pacing and word-play). Vaudeville was big in the late 1800s and early 1900s, one of the social issues still contested at the time was women in the workplace. Some vaudeville comedians would talk about women in the workplace, implying that alone was ridiculous or wrong, and then stop there and the audience would laugh as if something said was funny - that's conservative politics. That doesn't mean 100% of vaudeville is right-wing, it means politics is in vaudeville comedy.\n\nPolitics is part of life, so it's going to be in comedy. That doesn't mean it's about politics first and foremost.",

That's a conservatively-informed set of actions\n\nI disagree.  Not going to the hospital because you're in pain is not a \"right-wing\" thing, I assure you, as being personally someone who generally tries to downplay my pain and also being a progressive.  Plus it also has absolutely nothing to do with politics.  It is merely something you associate with people with conservative values.  That's a stereotype, and even if it were true, that doesn't make it political.  That's like saying that dying your hair is political.  Plenty of people do it, if only to remove the gray from their hair, but even dying it purple is both not indicative of being progressive nor is it political even if it were.\n\n>Politics is involved because it's a broad umbrella, but I'm not saying everything political must be right-wing. You're the one claiming that and I'm tiring of you inventing something I didn't say and then demanding I defend it.\n\nI don't even think you can call it political, much less right-wing.  You yourself referred to conservative humor after you rebuked my statement that there was nothing political about slice of life humor.  That clearly would seem to indicate that you mean to say not only is it political, it's right-wing as well.  But if you're moving the goalposts, fine.  Demonstrate it is political then.  Having kidney stones and not going to the hospital for the pain is something quite literally any walk of life could say they've done.\n\n>Some vaudeville comedians would talk about women in the workplace, implying that alone was ridiculous or wrong, and then stop there and the audience would laugh as if something said was funny - that's conservative politics.\n\nNow see, I will agree that this is conservative humor, because wanting women to stay home and be housewives is strongly associated with conservative values.  To make the distinction clearer, if a stand-up comedian were talking about his wife who happens to be a housewife, that's not conservative humor, because that's not a punchline and revealing to have conservative values \\*isn't\\* conservative humor in of itself.  The joke has to be pointing out the ridiculousness of what the left pushes.  Jeff Foxworthy talking about not going to the hospital for pain doesn't really show conservative values, but even if it did, it isn't conservative humor because it isn't the punchline.\n\n>That doesn't mean 100% of vaudeville is right-wing, it means politics is in vaudeville comedy.\n\nNor would I claim that 100% of vaudeville is right-wing, but I would call it political humor just the same.  Slice of life humor, by definition, isn't making the punchline about how the left wants women to work.  It's about talking about that time your wife was at home making dinner and something funny happened, which again shows conservative values, but not conservative humor.  You see the difference?\n\nThe inverse is true as well.  If some stand-up comedian was talking about something her same-sex partner had said that was funny, and it was entirely unrelated to being homosexual, that's not political.\n\n>Politics is part of life, so it's going to be in comedy. That doesn't mean it's about politics first and foremost.\n\nPolitics is part of life, and it is going to be in comedy.  That doesn't imply Jeff Foxworthy's slice of life humor is political unless you're calling **all** humor political.",

Maybe I'm wrong.  Show me I'm wrong or concede the point.  I'm asking in good faith, because if I'm wrong, I will admit that I'm wrong.\n\nThat's how good productive discussion happens after all.  Maybe I am being too focused on \"winning\" as you say, but I am asking proof of what you say is wrong and you're not providing.  If we stop this discussion right now, I will not be convinced of your argument.  Ultimately you wanted to convince me, no?  Or was I missing the point of this conversation entirely?",

You keep bringing up Jeff Foxworthy and defining and redefining labels on comedians. Foxworthy is your strawman argument, you keep pointing to him. You are free to go listen to Tim Wilson. He made lots of crappy right-wing political stance jokes and songs and told many slice of life bits as well. Dennis Miller would also be full of examples of conservative non-hate filled political humor.",

So me saying not all conservative comedians\u2019 jokes are hate-based is the opposite. \n\nIt all depends on your definition of right-wing humor.. I say right-wing humor is about hate, and if you want to contest that, you have to show examples of right-wing humor not about hate, right?  It's not artificial gatekeeping unless I look at your example of political right-wing humor that isn't about hatred and then I say \"that means it isn't political right-wing humor\" or \"that is about hatred.\"  \n\nIf I define right-wing humor as \"the stuff that's hateful\" then I would agree with you that it is just gatekeeping, but I haven't done any of that because I still lack examples.  I bring up Jeff Foxworthy because by \"conservative comedians who tell slice of life comedy bits\", I think you're referring to comedians like this, mostly because I am, in fact, trying to find an example of what you speak of.  \n\nI suppose I should just take it on good faith that you're right, without proof, based on your \"trust me, bro.\"  Lets just agree to disagree.",

Basically being provocative and over the top. \n\n It doesn't necessarily mean that they don't believe the things that they say, although for some of them it's tied to exaggeration.  It's more like a deliberate silliness. It's like how a lot of redneck culture is deliberate self aware acting over the top.  People know that truck nuts are ridiculous. The entire point is being kind of provocatively ridiculous.  This doesn't make it any less cringe, but the idea that they are just putting it on without any awareness of how it is seen is generally not true.\n\nAs such, It wouldn't be that surprising if they made their own comedy show where someone acted like colbert.  If people wonder how they get sucked in by Fox News, it's because many of them are aware that it's a little silly but just interpret it as being over the top to make jokes while still probably conveying loosely accurate information. Their comedy caters to the idea that being serious and provocative should overlap, so this can be weaponized to get them to treat obviously fake stuff as just minor exaggerations.",

Their personalities don't have to be as warped to commit much more heinous crimes.\n\nHence, they can actually be personable and likeable and there's no reason to pretend otherwise. There's a reason why Reagan was so likeable despite being everything Trump was (literally, even down to the treason and pandemic handling), and its not because 80+% of the country suddenly turned conservative for 8 years. \n\nBush also only cultivated this perception after 9/11, where the unity America was experiencing largely helped to put his personality (whether the bumpkin nature of it was an act or not) up front and center for everyone. Before that, Bush like Gore was considered a bore of a person. The 2000 election was very similar to 2016 in that neither candidate was liked much at all, which is why third parties had some of their best showings those years. Gore having 250k Florida democrats voting against him out of spite is why the election ended up being thrown at SCOTUS.",

It's not ubiquitous but in general have lost touch with good humor. It's the reason there are hardly any good comedic conservative talk shows or good prominently conservative comedians. No successful counter to the Daily Show and I guess some people consider Jim Bruer funny.\n\nMy friend is a very smart guy. It baffled me that this went over his head. On Adderall one day (college), I sent him a bunch of articles and links that showed history of Colbert's actual positions. He was almost always in character - even on interviews - so I had to dig deep. My friend didnaccept it tho.",

Including multiple cases of coercion, a woman forcing themselves on an unwilling man, and physical mutilation during sexual acts.  \n\nIt was brief and easily missed but in one scene they even have a black man being profiled while shopping in a mall. \n\nSo the politics was there but simply easy to miss.

How is me saying Oprah structured her charity being better than Clinton a pro-Trump stance?\n\nI just retorted \"The Clinton Foundation isn't the one being prosecuted for fraud, the Trump Foundation has like a 15% efficiency rate\" and the dude just shut up once he realized I wasn't \"on his side\".\n\nThat devolved into more politics and I just said dude, I'm trying to talk about how well Oprah's charity is, lets not talk politics. I just said Clinton Foundation as an example cause its the first bureaucratic charity that came to mind, not because I have any opinions what-so-ever on the people running it",

It would have broken my heart if he went full Qcumber like my youngest brother and sister. Instead, he gets to live in my head as a pretty good, if slightly politically misguided, dad who would have loved his grandkids.\n\nEdit: before someone comes in like 'tolerant left glad her dad died because he was conservative': no, it hurts like a knife to the heart every single time my kids do something I wish I could tell him about, every time I wish I could talk to him. But losing my siblings, who I stopped talking to after my brother told me that \"all true citizens have a duty to drag every Democrat into the streets and shoot them like the traitorous pedophile dogs they are\" and then didn't back down when I pointed out that it includes me, hurt somehow more profoundly because they *chose* this. They weren't tragically ripped away by cancer. They decided their political faction was more important than *my family's lives*. The fact that I don't have to worry whether my dad would have dragged them back to Earth or joined them (my brother was always his 'favorite' in that they got along the best and made the parent to friend transition the most smoothly) is the relief.",

They didn't have something to be proud of. They saw their communities fall apart from the dual punch of 2008 and the Opioid epidemic which saw the government ignore it then flub it. So they get home tired as fuck from the factory and click on the news. Fox News. They sit there at first and passively watch it and just kind of accept the broad strokes. Now, here comes a guy (Trump) who takes these talking points and cranks them to 11. No more are we arguing politely at BBQs but now we are full on going for the throat in our own homes. I watched it all happen with various people. The Propagandists knew exactly who to target which were bored housewives for the suburban professional class and the dogshit tired factory folk. Does this excuse them? No but it makes more sense to me.",

Only Man.\"\n\nThat might sound \"socialist\" to someone dipping into the well of American Conservatism, because that brand of conservatism is often coming from a religious background. However, an ideological conservative can certainly reject being beholden to any higher power including God, instead bringing individualism to an extreme. In fact, I would argue that American religious conservatives, in most cases, actually hold this as a core belief without even realizing it. It's the right wing conservatism that wholeheartedly embraces capitalist principles over the collective good is essentially rejecting entire swaths of Christian doctorine that concentrate on overlooking one's own needs in favor of the needs of others. They've made God all about them: their needs, their wants, their goals. It's idolatry of the self under the cloak of Christian symbolism.\n\nEdit: to loop this back to the subject of BioShock, if somebody with the aforementioned paradigm starts off playing the game with the idea that Rapture is a godless place, they'll almost certainly associate that godlessness with the leftism. That misconception might totally obscure the intended narrative.\n\nAlso, I can't believe that the name \"Andrew Ryan\" has flown over my head for this long... It can't be unintentional that \"Ayn Rand\" can be arranged to \"And Ryan\". It's just too close to be a coincidence, considering the subject matter.",

One could alter the pronunciation and intonation of that specific syllable of the song title to highlight the pun but that would sound so different from how Till Lindemann pronounces it in the chorus that I would consider the pun \u201cforced\u201d.\n\nI say that as somebody who spent half of his school years in a bilingual environment with many (often bad) inside jokes and puns that crossed language boundaries.

It has the same literal and poetic meaning as \u201cman vs. man\u201d in English.\n\nIt only starts to sound gay if you consider the context of a better known part of gay culture and gay erotica which is obsessed with hypermasculinity in a superficially similar way as some political ideologies (see Umberto Eco\u2019s [Ur-Fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco) for instance).\n\nAs an example, German supremacists between ~1900 until (at least) 1945 glorified the original Roman Empire which they see as the direct predecessor of the 2^nd and 3^rd Holy Roman Empires of Germany. Buff (German) warriors/heroes fighting in scant clothes in a style reminiscing classical art are a common trope in Nazi propaganda imagery. The best known instances are likely Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s photographies and films ([example](https://www.alamy.de/szene-aus-dem-film-olympia-von-leni-riefenstahl-museum-private-sammlung-image369031450.html)).\n\nOn the other hand, films like *Spartacus* (1960) are beloved among many gay men for their hypermasculine aesthetics ([example](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ag28vFX0T5s/WEAKFIEjUfI/AAAAAAAAEIc/vW6DcqMDnxEH67vdZz-SkMHaSIvPniSLwCEw/s1600/12.jpg)).",

Giovanni Gentile, Google him, he was the fascist philosopher, a neo Hegelian philosopher, and he defined fascism as a flavor of socialism, also fascism was opposed to capitalism from the ideological standpoint. The practical result was not so socialist maybe but root and intentions where definitely socialist. I don't like to talk about history or politics with the average American, they lack the nuance and the knowledge of European history and they like to talk out of their rear most of the time",

The aim of socialism is to prevent wage labor and production processes from being perceived as commodities. By giving workers the rights to national resources, socialism capitalizes on use value, rather than exchange value (Eccleshall, 1994). National Socialism permits the private ownership of national resources and production processes. In Nazi Germany, foreign corporations like IBM and Ford were not nationalized when Hitler became the Fuhrer. According to Bel (2006), Hitler\u2019s government privatized four banks and several steelwork companies, and gained a lot of revenue by taxing these large corporations (Loughlin, 2001).\nNational Socialism, as I understand it, focused way more on the \"national;\" making Germany great again.",

I\u2019ll bet that any wealth generated by those record sales didn\u2019t create long lasting value to the artists as much as it did to the record companies supporting them. These are the same companies still trying to keep as much artist value and consumer income as possible.\n\nIn the end, it stops being about what RATM thought it was about as soon as they released it. That\u2019s what makes it art.",

So, surely he'd be in favor of limiting the power of government, right?   \n\n\nThe government controls through the military and the police, so cut back on that, right? Ok, no. Those keep us safe. Well, fine. Understandable.   \n\n\nHow about personal freedoms. Abortion. Marijuana. Marriage Equality. Whelp, those are no's as well. Fuck man, [Paul Ryan even co-sponsored a bill](https://justfacts.votesmart.org/bill/3873/11979/26344/flag-burning-resolution) that would make Flag Burning illegal. For people who hate the government and restrictions, they sure do love restricting. But those are ok restrictions because they agree with them.   \n\n\nSo either they have to admit that they were never as anti-government as they professed, or they attack Rage Against The Machine and say they lost their way. Self-reflection is in short supply in politics, so it's not hard to see which ones they went with.",

Thus, you can be to the right of total anarchy and still be anti-authoritarian. How far is debatable, but I'm more talking about the political philosophy of Shining Path rather than the actions, because the actions are indefensible.\n\nFor Shining Path in particular, there's a good lesson for modern-day would-be revolutionaries in that ultimately what Guzman envisioned got lost in a lot of reactionary violence and a struggle for power. A guerilla takeover and the resulting civil disorder almost always attracts people there for the violence and/or potential political gain, regardless of the ideaology that lit the fuse. It's part of the reason I'm more of a pacifist than Morello.",

          "text": "Remember in 2015/2016 when the slogan of the Trump administration was, \"Drain the swamp?\" The machine that they believed they were raging against was the government, the establishment, the whole thing. There's propaganda that says that because big cities tend to be Democratic that they unfairly influence good country folk and as such rule the government, either directly when in power or in secret cabals and dark financing when not. But also, recall that Trump did \"drain the swamp\" to some extent by severely reducing the staffing in federal agencies and just not hiring new people for a lot of the positions that were emptied. They thought that was fighting the machine of bloated and expensive government. As such, they also see any government \"control\" or anything as part of the machine. Asking you to wear a mask, get a vaccine, some even say that having ID of any kind (passport or driver's ID) is going too far. I've known people who said that speeding laws and seat belt laws are government overreach.\n\nNow there are the same people who said they were raging against the machine of big government that support the anti-abortion movement who are saying that it's wrong for people to be against the government restricting one's right to abortion. Since their messaging isn't tied in with issue-by-issue consideration but these sweeping blanket statements, it comes off as entirely hypocritical. They want small, effectively almost no, government but then want government intervention for things they support.\n\nAnyway, it comes down to them assuming that Rage Against the Machine wanted all the same things they did. For many, that means a libertarian paradise where there's no government and everyone fends for themselves and people police themselves instead of having systems in place. Instead, Morello at least (and I'm guessing the rest of Rage, but I'll be honest, I'm not as familiar with the band) is a socialist, which just doesn't make sense to people who believe that socialism is about complete government control and censorship.",

He's saying you'll never see the working class get what they deserve by voting in a system that is fundamentally corrupted by corporate interests\n\n> In tha ruins there's a network for tha toxic rock  \nSchool yard ta precinct, suburb ta project block  \nBosses broke south for new flesh and a factory floor  \nThe remains left chained to the powder war  \n\n3rd line seems to be reference to outsourcing labor to Mexico. \"Toxic rock\" is obviously crack and \"powder war\" is probably the war on drugs. Crack ravaged working class black communities particularly hard and drug laws were written to carry greater penalties for crack than for the equivalent amount of powder cocaine. Not to mention that [Nixon privately stated that the war on drugs was intended to target blacks and hippies](https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/23/politics/john-ehrlichman-richard-nixon-drug-war-blacks-hippie/index.html)\n\nNot sure what he's driving at with \"remains left chained\"\n\n> They ain't gonna send us campin' like they did my man Fred Hampton\n\nHere is taunting the machine (for lack of a better word) by saying they can't get rid of us, unlike how COINTELPRO assassinated Fred Hampton (a communist revolutionary and deputy chairman of the Black Panther Party)\n\n> Still we lampin' still clockin' dirt for our sweat  \n\nworkers are underpaid\n\n> A ballots dead so a bullet's what I get  \nA thousand years they had tha tools  \n\nThe bourgeoisie controls the means of production\n\n> We should be takin' 'em  \n\nThe proletariat deserves to benefit from the value of their labor e.g., labor is entitled to all it creates.\n\n> Fuck tha G-ride I want the machines that are makin' em  \n\nDon't bother stealing the fruits of your labor, instead you should seize control of the means of production. Sorta the communist version of \"teach a man to fish....\"\n\nSide note: Zach de la Rocha says they have never advocated for violence. I don't know specifics about his ideas about revolution.",

It was restricting governments from interfering\n\nWhy is \"states rights\" more liberatian/anti-government than \"individual rights\"?",

That's the whole issue, legislators didn't do their jobs and enact legislation.  I'm personally pro-abortion and it's obvious to me that this was going to happen eventually.  Hell, Ginsburg said that the SC decision halted all progress on legislation which was probably a net negative, and she was right.  When the Democrats had the opportunity to push anything through they chose Obamacare and ignored abortion, and the overturn is actually great for the politicians cuz now they have a rallying cry and they got people like you up in arms on their side.  They don't give a shit about abortion, they just use it to secure your vote.\n\nBack to the SC, should Plessy vs Ferguson not have been overturned?  This shit happens, and it's often for the better.",

If you can't get your media out to people how can you expect to make change? Sometimes you have to work with the system that's there to change it. \n\n>Making shitloads of money\n\nIt sounds like you're just unhappy with the fact that they were able to make money calling out the corrupt system that they used to illuminate that corruption to people.",

Most of those artists you listed either came well before corporations monopolized the market, signed with whoever was a big name record or were signed by someone who originally was signed to major record labels who made a bunch of money then started their own. The amount of artists who signed to independent labels, stayed that way and achieved major fame is incredibly small. That's why it's great that artists like P-Diddy, Jay-Z etc signed with major labels, got their money and left, starting competing independent labels and found other great artists.",

They all worked together and built up a really solid network of bands, labels, venues, etc that competed against the corporate mainstream music industry. That is, until the major corporate labels appropriated the music and culture and resold it to the masses as a watered down, recuperated commodity.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recuperation_(politics)\n\nRATM came out in the early 90s right when the major labels hijacked the underground scene. They were just a knock off of another band called Urban Dance Squad.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/QQZGINShLWI\n\nRATM was signed to Sony. It's massively tone deaf for them to act like CRASS or something when they're owned by a major label and getting top 40 radio and video airplay.\n\n>  I'm talking about conservative, flag-waving nationalists like Ted Nugent, Kid Rock, Toby Keith, and that ilk\n\nWho gives a fuck? They're signed to the same parent companies as bands like RATM.\n\nI just checked. Ted Nugent is signed to Epic which is a sub label of Sony. They have the same bosses. Way to fight the power.",

They were the establishment, and therefore the machine to be raging against. So conservatives(or atleast this one in particular) thought that \"the machine\" = the establishment. Instead of meaning just the right in particular. \n\nAt some point in the last 20 years, its flipped. Progressives/liberals are now the dominant force, asserting definitive control over most forms of media, and now the government. This is the new establishment. This fellow here has noted the change, and assumes that RAtM would follow suit and start raging against the new machine, the new establishment, the new bosses. \n\nUnfortunately, thats where the confusion lies. RAtM was never about opposing the establishment, it was about opposing conservatives and the right-wing. They  will now as they did when they were representative of the youth.\n\nI write this to try and educate both sides to why their opposites are doing and saying what theyre doing and saying.",

Zack de la Rocha and Tom Morello in particular engage in their own personal activism. \n\nPretending that RATM is only a band worried about \"getting paid\" is a pretty dog shit take.

But you have to be brainless to not at least acknowledge the agenda behind the vaccine. But I\u2019m too apathetic towards our government to care either way to hold up a picket sign for either side.

They have been tested (and no they weren\u2019t rushed. None of the testing or trials were skipped, only the formal parts of having to get approved every step along the way by the government. Scientists were able to just go from one step to the next.) and the rates of death to Covid tor unvaccinated vs vaccinated show that being unvaccinated people die more often per capita. \n\n-Less consequences: two had people dragged from their homes, abused, attacked, and killed. You guys are not allowed in the businesses that the owners don\u2019t want you in because of their own rights to deny you entry for endangering people.\n\n-A personal choice that endangers others: not only do unvaccinated people die more often, this choice actually affects others. Being unvaccinated makes you more likely to get Covid and less equipped to fight it off. This leads to you being more likely to pass Covid to others and get them sick, leave them with life-long respiratory or immune system damage, or kill them. \n\nThese are facts and they don\u2019t care about your feelings. You are the only one here making baseless claims. So kindly take a step back, realize how much of an idiot you are, and kindly fuck off.",

In your argument please include when and how all Americans were mandated to take a vaccine and what punishment they would receive if they did not comply.

And if not vaccinated would the government imprison or fine those that weren\u2019t?)\n\nOn the flip side, make an argument that passing a law that makes abortion illegal is necessary and not part of bowing to a \u201cmachine\u201d. Feel free to explain how people were forced in any number to get abortions against their will, violating their rights, violating their choice, religion or personal beliefs. \n\nOr you can try: Make an argument that a teacher cannot explain why a child in class has two parents of the same gender to another child. Or: Make an argument why a school board should be allowed to ban specific words, laws and history from being taught on the basis that it may make some children feel bad for being part of a group of people who, at one time, subjected another group to horrific abuse.

You're only making this a \"leftist\" issue because you have a problem with \"leftists.\" You're using this issue to try and further validate your other biased beliefs.\n\nI have clearly defined and consistent principles. You fabricate elaborate fantasies about the people you're talking to and call them morons. It's literally what the majority of your post history is.\n\n>The \"Yes please, I'll do what you tell me\" is written all over this discussion.\n>\n\nNo, the majority of people simply didn't \"need\" to be told to get a vaccine in the name of public health. They treated it like other vaccines and wanted to be responsible.\n\nYou \"need\" to paint people who disagree with you as \"fascists\" because you're a dork grasping for reasons to hate people. And because you clearly have a [repressed fetish.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/voxr3f/z/iegmhjs)\n\n>And I am not anti-vaxx for being against MANDATES. This is the lie that you push because you have no argument against liberty.\n\nYou know why vaccine requirements exist, which is why you guys all need to talk about this like you're under attack by some clandestine organization.\n\nYou sound like every other whiny goober raging on the internet, pretending they're part of some grand battle for liberty. Go do something meaningful and stop desperately searching for persecution.",

The freedom from harm via disease and the freedom of choosing what goes into your body. \n\nIdeally we would have both but that's not possible in cases like the COVID vaccine since by choosing not to have the vaccine, you actively put others at risk, thus removing their freedom from harm via disease.\nThus, these 2 freedoms must be prioritized and one favoured over the other. \n\nI personally (and many would agree with me) believe that the right to someone's safety should override the freedom of what goes into your body, especially since the freedom of what goes into your body is extremely limited anyways. We constantly unknowingly and unwillingly take into our bodies numerous chemicals in our food, water and air, and so the freedom of choice over what goes into our body is more an unattainable ideal than anything else",

I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as editor of The New England Journal of Medicine\u201d.\n\nMore recently, Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, wrote that \u201cThe case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness\u201d\n\n[http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-736%2815%2960696-1](http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-736%2815%2960696-1).\n\nOur love of \u201csignificance\u201d pollutes the literature\n\nwith many a statistical fairy-tale. We reject important\n\nconfirmations. Journals are not the only miscreants.\n\nUniversities are in a perpetual struggle for money and\n\ntalent, endpoints that foster reductive metrics, such as\n\nhigh-impact publication. National assessment procedures,\n\nsuch as the Research Excellence Framework, incentivise\n\nbad practices. And individual scientists, including their\n\nmost senior leaders, do little to alter a research culture that\n\noccasionally veers close to misconduct.\n\nCan bad scientific practices be fixed? Part of the\n\nproblem is that no-one is incentivised to be right.\n\nInstead, scientists are incentivised to be productive\n\nand innovative.

Immunity elicited by direct vaccination or by maternal vaccination prolongs host survival but does not prevent infection, viral replication or transmission, thus extending the infectious periods of strains otherwise too lethal to persist. Our data show that anti-disease vaccines that do not prevent transmission can create conditions that promote the emergence of pathogen strains that cause more severe disease in unvaccinated hosts.\n\nIf only every plague bird in the world would comply and get their HSV shots and boosters then they wouldn't have to worry about them dying when coming into any contact with farm raised chickens.",

No, you brought that up because you\u2019ve run dry on relevant shit to talk about. Yeah I\u2019m sure people got covid at BLM protests (which were outside, btw, and largely masked), but I also have the empathy to understand why people went out to protest anyway. They did so despite the risks, not willfully ignorant of them. If you had church sermons inside, against protocol/guidelines, you reap what you sow and I have no sympathy for those of your flock who paid the price. \n\nYour 5 day old account tells me you are likely just a troll, but just as an aside: If you call those protests a riot but don\u2019t call Jan 6th a violent insurrection your automatically arguing in bad faith or a moron, maybe both.",

Vietnam released on election day 1992, to their crusade to free political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal, consistent communist/socialist imagery in their merch and on their stage, their guerilla music video on the steps of the stock market promoting the #Occupy movement, and their direct links to progressive activism around the globe.\n\nAnd that's just scratching the surface stuff. To be that blind as to the root existence of RATM is just mind boggling. Do these people think Bulls on Parade was a love song?",

He starts in on how they are woke and how Morello needs to stick to guitar and out of politics. I mention TM's academic credentials on the subject. Then he goes off on people with education lying to the public masses. I asked him the direct question, \"what machine do you think they were raging against back in the day?\" He pivoted to all lives matter and I just laughed it off.

That's exactly what US dems and reps are on the political spectrum, what they defend, where political scientists place them, and where they would land among other parties in most other oecd countries. They're both capitalist parties, one liberal, one reactionary, and that's about it. I got 6 presidential candidates in my country's last election alone at the left of US most \"left-leaning\" congressperson. Every right leaning party in Europe is mostly aligned with US Dems. Whereas RATM are revolutionary communists. That's actual left, far-left even with that revolutionary aspect. Thus my question, how is that a criticism of this left band that they are even far more critical of the far-right than they are of the right?",

Which to be fair they have pretty much done. In contrast, greenday is as corporate as they come. US Dems are just as dirty and corrupt as the GOP, they can just hide it better. \n\nThis is why bands that sing about topics are much easier to associate with, system of a down (i listen to them far more) byob - protest the war, sugar - protest the marginalizing of people during the Atlantic slave trade, chop suey - suicide epidemic these are all concepts that both political parties benefit from in different ways. RATM are similar is terms of the content. \n\nNow look at Greenday - wake me up when September ends, American idiot, etc. These songs are far more on the nose in terms of who they are singing about.",

But the competition and free market part only exists in some branches of capitalism, not capitalism as a whole, nor do they are exclusive to it. Oligarchy for instance is entirely a branch of capitalism. Whereas market socialism is entirely a branch of socialism.\n\nBy the same, you're also mixing decentralization into it. Capitalism can be as much centralized as it can be decentralized. And same goes for socialism, which can go from being entirely centrally planned, to being extremely decentralized with each workplace and community entirely deciding of their whole inner working.\n\nLike capitalism, socialism simply refers to the social (workers') ownership of the means of production. Beyond that it has more flavors than my local Italian ice cream artisan.",

RATM has always been corporate sellouts and hypocrites. They were signed to Sony and their 'politics' undermined the true grassroots punk scene via cultural subversion.

He's the godfather of the DIY punk movement which caught on through the 80s with a lot of other bands and people across North America. Mackaye is his own boss and he's a multi-millionaire. He's an ethical capitalist.\n\nHe refused to play in venues that weren't all ages. They only charged like $10 for tickets. They had stickers on their albums that said that they weren't to be resold for more than like $15. Their shows were always sold out.  I saw them play in a 1500 person venue. Quick math: That's 15k in 1 night just on the door. Since they aren't signed to a major label, they don't have to give the lion's share to their bosses. Decent coin for a day's work but they spent a decade building a fan base first.\n\nRATM didn't have to do any of that.\n\nSub Pop was another small indie label that was growing. Geffen Records is a major label. They poached Nirvana from Sub Pop and gave them a devil's deal which made them famous and turned Grunge into the new big thing. By doing so, it turned indie culture top 40/mainstream/corporate.\n\nRATM was automatically signed to Sony and given a big deal and big stage access.\n\nAll of that destroyed the punk scene by infiltration and appropriation. It killed the 'community' and network that was allowing indie musicians the ability to actually make a living for themselves without having bosses.\n\nSidenote: Your comment reminded me of this scene from Bill Murray's first dramatic movie, the Razor's Edge.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zZLWtFiU0Io",

Still mixing the capitalist boss with who is signed to it though.\n\nDoes RATM owns means of production by which they earn a passive income on the back of labor of the actual active workers?

Him and a bunch of other guys started indie labels and networked together to create a way to distribute their music and control the 'means of production' by cutting out the corporate racketeers.",

Before you reply, though...  \n\nPlease note that none of their shows have a vaccine requirement because those ordinances, which they had no control over, have been lifted by the cities and venues they are playing in. You no longer need to be vaccinated or have proof of a negative test to attend their shows. I just went to one the other night and walked right in.  \n\nTheir ticket prices were totally reasonable ($85-125 for 90% of the tickets, the rest were more expensive and all proceeds went to charity), and the prices you are seeing now are from scalpers (not the band's fault). Beyond that, they are donating money from their shows to charitable causes above and beyond the charity ticket proceeds.  \n\nLet me guess, you are going to say they support the Democrats? That is blatantly false. All you need to do is listen to their songs, watch their music videos, listen to Zack's speeches during shows, etc and it is plainly obvious that is incorrect. Not to mention that they played protest shows outside of Democratic events on at least two different occasions, and you can even watch one of them here and hear Zack call out the Dems and the DNC within the first few minutes:  \n\nhttps://youtu.be/0g_MNpS9hM0  \n\nHere is another example from a show in 2007 where Zack called out the Dems: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/YLqBA0_Ucgs?t=3511  \n\nMaybe you will call out the fact that they profited off of their music career. I hate to break it to you but we live in a capitalist system and they were simply paid for their labor at a rate that the market found acceptable. They don't live in a vacuum and they are entitled to money for their labor. Do you really expect them to work for free and live like paupers on the streets just because they have leftist ideals, which don't require a life of poverty to begin with?  \n\nDid I miss anything? If so, I'll be happy to clear it up for you.",

That's absolutely not the same belief as leftists like RATM have. Being more critical of (what is on the political spectrum and in the rest of the world) far-right reactionary policies than of right liberal policies doesn't mean that leftists embrace right-wing beliefs.

If anything, forcing millions of people to give birth to unwanted children plays into both the military and prison industrial complex (unwanted and/or poor children are more likely to be imprisoned and go into the military), while pro-choice acts against both by allowing millions of unwanted pregnancies to be aborted, thereby hurting the military and prison industrial complexes.",

Read what I said again. Criminals who end up in prison are incredibly valuable to the for-profit prison industrial complex. Not to mention other affects high crime rates have on industries involving security, weapons, surveillance, etc, and how it serves to expand the police state.  \n\n> There\u2019s more than enough poor people for the system, especially with the influxes from other nations. \n\n...\n\n> There\u2019s more than enough poor people for the system\n\nAnd yet the SC argued in their draft that overturning Roe was needed, in part, to increase the \"domestic supply of infants\", which they cited a CDC report for that indicated the domestic supply was insufficient for demand. They are referring to adoption demand but they know full well that many, many children never get adopted and instead end up being on track for the military or prison later in life.  \n\n> Those immigrants are what keep the bottom running, births/deaths has been negative for quite some time.  \n\nHence, there is an effort to change that trend.  \n\n> While the bottom stays running on immigrants, the mid and top income companies take care of themselves. \n\nYou seem to have fallen for conservative hysteria about immigrants because, in case you haven't noticed, businesses are having a very hard time filling low end jobs right now.  \n\n> Abortion is much cheaper than maternal leave, no matter how shitty and disincentivized of a leave it is. \n\nWe don't have guaranteed paid maternal leave here in the US and, as a result, very few actually get it.  \n\nSorry but you are just way off base on this.",

It's about profits, not influencing how and when women conceive children. \n\n> Before we get all into the prison complex, are you seriously arguing that more criminals is beneficial to the \u201cmachine\u201d?  \n\nHow do you think for-profit prisons operate and earn money, exactly? There is even a name for it - prison-industrial complex. Do you think it is just a random occurrence that the US represents 5% of the world population and has 25% of the world's prison population? It is an incredibly profitable industry and inmates are used as slave labor (it's even codified in the Constitution).  \n\n> Obviously it would be if they were just magically transported into the prison system at 13 like you seem to be treating it, but that\u2019s not the case. \n\nYou aren't aware of our juvenile detention system, I take it.

They don't want the labor market to be dictated by the workers, and a higher number of workers forces everyone to accept worse and worse conditions. It's simply supply and demand at work.",

The conservatives were the ones licking the boots of Republican leaders who lied to them once again that they could ignore the rights of their fellow citizens by violating their freedom to not be infected as much as possible by a deadly and unwanted virus which only uses their bodies against their will, as well as to keep themselves alive as best they could during a deadly pandemic. Just like anti-choicers do with pregnancy. Mandates weren't even close to forcing needles in arms (if you want to talk about forcing needles into people's arms talk about the military that these same anti-vaxxers were glorifying at the same time). Mandates give you a choice. Either wear a mask/get a Covid test/get vaccinated or don't go to work so that you can't infect an immunocompromised person directly or indirectly and affect their own ability to work and provide for their family. Vaccines don't affect those around you like a virus does either. So how does that boot taste bootlicker?",

In fact, the global maternal pregnancy survivability rate is 99.8%, slightly more deadly than the 99.85% global covid death rate.  And it is significantly worse on women between the ages say 15-45.  So, the two are more equivalent than you think.  From a transmissibility and death risk standpoint.\n\nNow, you *could* chose to properly socially distance, thereby avoiding ~~infection~~ pregnancy and remove yourself from the artificial consequences imposed on you by society.  Right? At least that's what they told the unvaccinated isn't it? \n\nMoreover, abortion has a 100% fetal mortality rate.  Whereas covid non-vaccination has nothing close to that. \n\nBut rather than try to parse out the illogical philosophical pretzel you have to turn yourself into in order to somehow allow the government to have the power to hold your job hostage in order to coerce you into being part of a medical experiment and somehow not allow it to impose some other set of consequences in order to coerce you to have a baby you don't want, wouldn't it just make more sense to say \"government, keep your damn hands off my body, medical coercion of any kind is unacceptable\"?

If I sit down and have coffee with a pregnant person, I'm not going to get pregnant. 100% guaranteed. If you could only get covid through intercourse, then I'd understand your point. But just being in a room with someone that has covid can cause an infection. \n\n>Now, you could chose to properly socially distance, thereby avoiding infection pregnancy and remove yourself from the artificial consequences imposed on you by society.\n\nAgain, you cannot get pregnant just by being in close proximity to someone. You could literally be on top of someone face to face and there will be zero pregnancies with sexual intercourse. So you can work with pregnant people and you won't get pregnant. The same cannot be said about an airborne virus. \n\n>Moreover, abortion has a 100% fetal mortality rate. Whereas covid non-vaccination has nothing close to that. \n\nWhat has that got to do with anything?? We don't grant fetuses personhood and they certainly aren't citizens of any city, state or country.\n\n>wouldn't it just make more sense to say \"government, keep your damn hands off my body, medical coercion of any kind is unacceptable\"? Seems logical to me. \n\nYou don't even know what my personal stance is on the topic, so don't assume. I'm against government mandates. I'm fine with any business requiring their employees to be vaccinated against something that could be spread in the workplace, since that is a safety measure.  And at the end of the day, you do not have to be vaccinated (as evidenced by the many Americans who aren't vaccinated) and you'll face zero legal consequences for that choice.  That means the government never had its hands on your body. The same is NOT true for places where abortions are banned.\n\nAlso, we've seen restrictions for masks and vaccine requirements lifted as covid has settled more. That's not how the GQP wants to treat abortion bans, they want it to be permanent and nationwide.",

The Dems have been corporate sellouts since well before Clinton, and the band never supported them in the first place. You can go back and listen to bootlegs of their early shows and Zack was calling them out back then, and they made their views abundantly clear in their final album.",
