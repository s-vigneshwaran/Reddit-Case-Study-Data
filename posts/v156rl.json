Most people in your situation try for a first time home buyers loan which is a mistake because the restrictions for houses that qualify make it hard to find an affordable house. Also, most people think you need 20% down for a traditional mortgage loan but you can go in with as little as 3-5% and opt to pay PMI on your mortgage which is a little extra but even still your mortgage is smaller than any rent you'd pay if you get a sensibly priced house. Then you can split your mortgage payments into a bi monthly billing cycle which does a few things, 1. It breaks your monthly mortgage into 2 payments a month which makes it easier to pay, 2. It hits more of the principle amount of your mortgage loan so you pay it off quicker and pay less interest.\n\nSource: I'm 30 and have owned my own home for over 5 years. Bought it for around $130,000(valued at 245,000 now) with only $5,000 down on a traditional loan when I was making only about $35,000 - $40,000 a year as the only person that worked in a house with 2 kids and a stay at home wife. My mortgage is 2 payments of like almost 840 a month.",

Yet at some places every parent gets derisively called a breeder, regardless of whether they have one kid at 35 or six by 25.

Young kids have all kinds of needs. Older kids also have all kinds of needs, but they\u2019re completely different needs. Good parenting requires patience, attention, empathy, sacrifice\u2026 just lots and lots of personal energy. I love my kids and I\u2019m happy with my choices, but it\u2019s a lot harder on me and my spouse than I expected.\n\nParenting was also hard on my parents, who were in worse circumstances than me.

They expect a lot back from me, as their adult kid, and I can\u2019t satisfy their needs because my kids take priority.

Now that I\u2019m actually old enough to have kids, I think differently. I see it as my responsibility to look at what kind of world I\u2019d be bringing them into, and frankly, it doesn\u2019t look good.\n\nI sincerely believe that environmental issues will become unavoidable and *huge,* and the various governments/corporations with the most potential to help are too corrupt/greedy to do so. I simply do not think it\u2019s right bring a child into a world that I have so little hope for. I\u2019d be saddling them with generations of problems that they had nothing to do with, but are now responsible for. Just *wanting* a child isn\u2019t enough. It wouldn\u2019t be *fair* to them, and that\u2019s more important.",

You pay upwards of $36 if you overdraw your account. If you make minimum wage, thats 8% of your weekly income before taxes. Miss your car payment? It's $40 more next time. Lose your job and your bank account goes negative? You could make it positive but your rent and car payment are more important. Your bank account is closed within 2 months. Don't have a bank account? Have to go pay your car payment at Western Union (please use urgent pay for $10 extra). Now your car insurance has lapsed, too. Don't own a home? Sorry your car insurance rate is higher. Can't drive to job interviews now because you don't have car insurance. Just to be sure, they notify the DMV who then SUSPENDS your license. Now you shouldn't borrow your friend's car, either, but you do anyway and get pulled over and receive a ticket ($500 plus court costs).\n\nThe depression sets in and now you don't even want to try to right your ship. Creditors are hassling you day-in and day-out. Any money you DO make is going straight into paying stacked-up bills. Rent and electricity is usually first priority, but you better get that ticket taken care of before you get a warrant and face jail time. Your cell phone service got cancelled so you have to find a way to the court annex. Your bank account got cancelled so you have to pay cash. That's taken care of. If you're lucky, your car hasn't been repossessed. You pay the 2 months you owe and the $80 in late fees. You need to get it insured. Spend a night shopping around. Your credit sucks, so you have to pay $200 up front to even get approved. That ticket you just got looks bad, though, so your insurance is even higher than before. Now, you need a bank account. There's a minimum balance, though, and you need $200 to open it. Yikes. That's taken care of.\n\nYou're finally starting to tread water and then...tooth ache. Agonizing tooth ache. That filling got breached and now you have to get a root canal. Your jaw is swollen and infected and you have to miss work. You have health insurance but it doesn't cover dental. Now you have to pay over $1000 to get this tooth fixed. You're missing work because of the agonizing pain.\n\nThe process starts over. Your credit gets shittier. Your car gets repo-ed. Bank fees and late fees and re-installment fees.\n\nYou could have avoided all of this if you'd just learned more about the real world in school or at home, but standardized testing required you to learn calculus and trigonometry rather than filing taxes, balancing a checkbook, how credit scores work, how auto-loans work and other basic money management.\n\nOh well.",

I could save on that with a mortgage, but I'm not paying the prices that are doubled what they were 2 years ago. \n\nSo I wallow in my hedonistic lifestyle.

To steer such a family towards a net positive in all that is important to A family.\n\nThese are the unrelenting thoughts that drill my brain every time I just try to get to sleep, to armour myself for the wars of tomorrow \ud83e\udde0 making an already difficult task all the more challenging and under resourced. \n\nBut hey, gotta try.",

I also don't understand the \"kids are expensive af\"-mentality. They can be if you're really bad with your financial stuff but if you make the right choices they shouldn't be. I can buy pretty much whatever I want to and still not go bankrupt, and I'm not from a rich family either. I used to eat toiletpaper sometimes during my childhood because we couldn't afford any food. My mom once bought several Kg of really cheap porridge in installments because she couldn't afford it all at once. I hated porridge for months afterwards.\n\nIf you waste your money or live in a country where you have to pay for everything yourself then maybe, only maybe, it's expensive with kids. But if you make the right choices in life it shouldn't be.\n\nSo what's the suffering then? Not enough spare time? I get maybe 7 hours of me-time every day so it's not like you wouldn't get any time for your self either. My daughter fall asleep around 7 in the evening and I go to bed 1 or 2 after midnight. That's a lot of time to do whatever I want. It's more than enough time for me. Usually I sit infront of the computer and play games or binge watch a show. Or I play some local co-op with my SO in the living room.\n\nLife doesn't have to be shit because of kids. You just have to follow some routines and make sure your kid is in bed at 7 as they should be imo.\n\nBut of course, not everyone want kids and they shouldn't feel forced to. Don't do stuff you don't want to. That's just stupid.",

Because of the lack of guns, the UK has a serious problem with youth knife crime. Kids are being groomed to become drugs mules and get sent across the country to deal drugs on the dealers behalf (that way kids get arrested instead of dealers). Loosing these drugs is a major no-no so these kids now arm themselves with knives, not to protect themselves but to protect the drugs. Because these kid dealers are carrying, other normally law abiding kids are now carrying knives in order to feel safe. I use \"feel\" very loosely here because they don't realise having a knife make provoke trouble or get them sent down for the rest of their childhood. So yeah, even the UK has its issues that will worry parents these days, its just not on the scale of a gun shooting.",

Even then suicide itself isn't what most people think of when looking at the stat.\n\nSo, as long as your kid isn't slinging drugs in a gang or have a mental health issue (and access to an unsecured firearm) then, chances are, it won't die by gun.",

So many kids or barely adults whose primary goal in life is to have children ASAP, like it's a race and the faster and more often you achieve it the bigger measure of success it is and a constant cause for celebration. Yet they don't see the connection with following that same pattern of their parents and grandparents with the generational poverty and limitation of opportunities and upward mobility in life.",

It's not fair to blame the ppl who aren't having kids. See, you're not reading me.\n\n> Then why are you seemingly against people not wanting kids?\n\nBecause few million less white people isn't going to change anything. they'll be replaced immediately by people who do not care. Earth can sustain only few million humans. (source: I made it up by having thoughts on how manipulating our environment with agriculture was the root issue that led us there)\n\n> Boomers will eventually die off, if we have a ton of kids, they're just going to repeat the same cycle in the future. Too many of 'X' generation around.\n\nI've just looked at american's demographic curves and 25-35 year old seem to be the new boomer generation, so the boomers will die off then WE will be the problem.\n\n> Having sex is not really as important as you think. \n\nWhy do you keep talking me about sex? I know it's the fun part in making kids but the point isn't sex.\n\n> In your world, would people even work their 'cArEeRs' (aka the labor you talk about) or would they just be baby raising machines?\n\nThere's no \"in my world\", I look at recent history and I see societies based off monotheist religious precepts of marriage, monogamy, working and having kids. Everyone has to contribute and these societies were pretty competitive and won against societies that had cultures with less familial stability and more internal social competitions. Society in order to be competitive and striving should care about every one of us contributing. Again, my argument is, don't blame childfree people, blame society for not giving them incentives to make more kids.",

But then, society isn't just trying to sustain itself, it's greedy, it wants perpetual growth, it should push people to reproduce more, by rewarding them preferably. For a country that has public funded retirement, it's important to have more active people than retired people for instance.\n\n> I'd argue someone adopting and raising a kid or even working as a day care worker or teacher is far more of a contribution than just popping a kid out.\n\nWhy? That's labor like any other. Besides, plenty of people do labor job that are critical to society without having to touch to a kid. Like the people who grow food, who build things, who manage the electric grid, water grid, ect... They're as important as daycare workers and teachers. But if you stop making kids, who will grow food for the elders? Who will take care of the elders? Shit will just collapse in worst case scenario, and better case scenario the next generations are just having it really bad. Like the millenials and zoomers right now.",

Clearly quantity is important at some point\n\nI'm not saying that we shouldn't have replacement-level fertility, just that this labor doesn't have to be divided equally. I know three coworkers who each had four, five, and five kids respectively. That's 14 kids divided amongst  3 couples. If we want to maintain replacement-level fertility (2-ish per couple), then 4 other couples in their cohort should *not* have kids. So there is always going to be slack in the system that allows for a certain percentage of people to not reproduce. \n\nThe other thing you'll notice is that a lot of people here are talking about not being able to afford kids. Things like stagnant wages send a signal to people that our society doesn't want kids being born (regardless of whether that's true or not). On aggregate, I'd say people aren't being selfish, they're simply rational actors responding to their environment.\n\n>But that also means that some people choosing to not have kids for the \"environment\" are just full of shit because it's non consequential for the environment.\n\nUltimately, people are going to make their own choices based on their morals, values, etc. Simply telling those people to have kids isn't going change anything. Again, they're responding to the material conditions of the world around them. Until/unless those material conditions change, people in that camp aren't going to budge.",

Strategic non-reproduction is a defining trait of all social animals. The logical extreme of sociality is eusociality, like ants, where the division of labor extends to reproduction \u2014 only a minority are responsible for reproducing, and the rest support those who do. \n\nWe humans don't go that far, but we're still social animals. We have individuals hardwired to not reproduce (homosexuality), we have traits that encourage individuals to throw themselves in harm's way so as to sacrifice their own reproductive potential in favor of group survival (altruism), we have in-built reproductive limits that shift caregiving to more distant descendants (menopause), etc. Mankind has *never* operated at full capacity when it comes to reproduction, and that's by design. Social animals have to share resources, and if every individual selfishly focused on passing on their own genes to the detriment of group survival, our species would have died out a long time ago.\n\nSlack in the system is a good thing \u2014 it frees up social resources for caregiving. You don't want every young, able-bodied person tied down with childrearing.\n\n> Kids are the biggest contribution you can make. \n\nAs a counterpoint, once upon a time, Sir Isaac Newton had a student, who had another student and so on, who eventually had me, a scientist. That's the legacy that lives on in me, and it can't be passed down by blood. I share so much more in common with that family tree than any biological one: we have a unity of purpose, a commitment to service, and a passion for discovery. As I mentor students of my own, I pass on that tradition to the next generation. That's more significant to me than having biological kids of my own, in terms of contributing to society.",

Kids need to be raised to be decent, hardworking contributors to society.\n\nYes people do raise the kids they make, that's lots of unpaid labor on top of the paid labor they do and pay taxes with. It's like they're already doing twice more than you do, on top of raising an individual who will contribute as much as you if not more. In short, people who have and raise kids are contributing exponentially more than you.\n\n> Or, you know, you can not have kids and help society by not contributing to the massive climate change issue and increasing resource access we have.\n\nDo that, I'm sure the billions of asians do care that the 500 millionish first worlders are restricting themselves. Your lineage will die and be replaced by people who won't care about that issue. Your society will die and be replaced by a society which won't care about that issue. \n\nAll that because you think few million less humans will do anything while we're 10 000 times too much and have a way of living that's fundamentally incompatible with our environment's survival.\n\nIt's not a matter of opinion. Society needs its population replacing itself. You need other people's kids to survive the later stage of your life. Money can be printed, but humans can't, making kids is the most significant contribution to society.\n\nBut as I said, it's not logical to blame people. Society should manage its own survival.",

They do their job, and they duplicate. If they stop duplicating you're very much doomed.\n\nWhat do you do to contribute to society's survival? You do labor, you pay taxes. But people who have kids also work and pay taxes, but they also make sure there's a new generation that'll work and pay taxes, and duplicate itself. In short, it's the biggest form of contribution to society, you can always print money, you can't print humans.\n\nNow I'm adopting society's perspective because society should seek to survive and be competitive, and therefore should put incentives on its cells (us, the humans) to reproduce. If it doesn't provide us favorable conditions to have kids comfortably, it's in its defavor. But if you have a hard time thinking this way, if there's no new generation or less people, you're going to not have much people to take care of you, pay taxes for the infrastructures, or work to run the system.

But if you think working is plenty contribution enough, can't you compute that the kids you're going to raise are going to work too? It's like you compare your single contribution, with the contribution of people who work, raise kids for free, kids that are going to work, have kids, raise kids, who will work too... Ect... it's like comparing your flat contribution to an exponential contribution. It's that much more important to society that you produce kids because otherwise nothing will work and society dies.

You can't realistically expect some parents to have 10 kids to compensate for those who have 0. There's a finite amount of resource for parent's unpaid labour.\n\n> What makes their exponential contribution less than bearing one offspring?\n\nWhat makes it more than bearing one offspring? Your kids will work and contribute, make more kids. The teacher isn't putting that thing in motion, if nobody makes kids the teacher is useless.\n\n> Again, let me know if you think people who have 2 kids are twice as valuable to society.\n\nYes, the more kids, the more contribution. Logic isn't it\n\n> if you admit that you can\u2019t measure it, then your whole argument doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\nYes it does, you don't need to know precise numbers when you know one is crushing the other by a long shot.\n\n> \u201cBiggest contribution\u201d necessarily dictates that you must be able to assign a value to certain contributions relative to others.\n\nNo, that's highschool level math.",

                          "text": "I mean the rewards aren't making it worth it right now because the rewards were never supposed to cover the full cost of the kid. The rewards were even lower or nonexistent during the times when birthrates were high. The biggest issue is that kids cost TIME and in a world where you no longer need a kid to find fulfillment and definitely don't need to find extra ways to spend your time, higher income levels have increasingly less kids. People with a higher income aren't going to have kids for a few bucks and we obviously can't start handing out absolutely ginormous checks. So we'd have to find something that actually enthralls them... which is very difficult.\n\nThe difference now is that a lot of people don't want to just be able to afford the kid, they want to give the kid a great life and actually be able to raise it properly. Which makes people wait to have kids until they are in a good place in life, the problem is that good place in life is becoming harder and harder to achieve. The higher your income the less time you have which is the biggest problem and the government can't give you time. However they could try and do it indirectly by supporting work reforms that lower hours with the same income, but obviously that isn't feasible in our current political climate.\n\nThere is also the fact that you have to actually try and raise your kids now, during high birthrate eras people were able to do whatever they wanted to their kids. Lots of people would have kids and neglect or abuse them so that they didn't have to actually raise them properly, hence the jaded attitude many of the older generations have towards 'new-age parenting'. Parents don't care less about raising their kids, they just know they can't get away with the cold-hearted shortcuts older generations used to take.\n\nThen there is the increase in contraceptive availability and better sex education, which is obviously a good thing in general and needs to be better. But these things obviously lower the birthrate mostly for the poor, which is good, but the poor are the highest birthrate by far so it has a cascading effect.\n\nRewards have never been the problem, they may be a solution, but just handing out money isn't going to solve things either. Handing out money would only increase the birthrate for poorer populations, which is the exact opposite of what we want. Not that we should try and prevent poor people from having kids, but we should be encouraging higher income families to have kids since they can provide the better life for them.\n\nA big problem is that the government actually wants poor people having kids more than rich people, because poor people having kids creates a perpetual cycle of cheap labor. Hence why even the politicians who are vocally supportive of abortion aren't actually doing anything to stop it from being outlawed again.\n\nThen there is also the fact that socially people are becoming more awkward, gender dynamics are shifting radically, traditionalist values around sexual expressions are still limiting, etc. Less women are willing to tie themselves down, even if the rewards were good they wouldn't want to. But at the same time it becomes a problem because women won't 'date down' which means the increasing amounts of successful women means those women, in their eyes at least, have a shrinking pool of men to choose from. If they even find someone it may be past their prime for childbearing. This contributes to an already skewed gender dynamic of more men than women at most ages and becoming more skewed over time. And many of those younger women have a tendency to date older men who are less likely to be willing to have a child with them, further skewing things.\n\nBasically, it isn't just rewards, there are a LOT of factors, certainly many more which I didn't list.",

And if people in first world countries really did put that effort together, they'd be the only ones and they'll make their societies less competitive against other societies which won't care about the environment and overpopulation.\n\n> You see, I would love a family, but it would be financially and morally irresponsible for me to bring a child into this world when I can not meet the financial obligations of raising said child at this point of my life.\n\nAs I said, that's society's fault for not giving you the right incentives for its own survival. Blaming childfree people makes no sense.\n\n> But fuck me for thinking about the impact my decisions have on my community and their resources, right?\n\nYou're going to be culled and your mindset will die with you tho. :/ Your greater \"morality\" isn't solving anything.\n\nThe root of my thinking is that our environment was doomed the day we started manipulating it.",

They claimed they had no regrets, this has nothing to do with opportunity cost.\n\nHere's a comparison;\n\nThe opportunity cost of paying your mortgage off early is that the money isn\u2019t invested. You lost out on potential gains from the market because of your choice.\n\nJust because you acknowledge a potential opportunity cost of paying the mortgage off early doesn't mean you have any regrets towards the choice. Maybe you don't have a high risk tolerance, maybe you want the peace of mind, etc.\n\nThe inverse can also be argued. The opportunity cost of having kids is less money, less freedom, risk of having a child with special needs that takes a significant amount of lifelong care, etc etc.\n\nBy your own argument, parents must also regret having kids because of the \"opportunity cost\"?\n\nIn any case, I don't think either necessarily needs to \"have any regrets\" towards their decision. I know having kids is not for me, I just don't have any of that paternal instinct. I don't find them cute, I don't like their voices and screeching, I don't have any interest in taking care of one or spending money on one, etc. I don't regret not having kids one bit, neither does my wife.\n\nPart of me expects that most parents would have some amount of regret of what their life would have been like without kids, but I am open minded enough to accept if that's not the case.",

Those that choose to abstain are in the minority. It's a non conforming viewpoint. Pretty simple.\n\nThey were not \"preaching\" anything. Do you want to guess how often I've been criticized, belittled, or discredited for my choice to not have kids, vs times I've  done or seen the equivalent done to parents?\n\nI can't even tell you how many times people have tried to convince me that I'm wrong. Or said \"you'll change your mind\" or \"you'll regret it\" or \"you are selfish for not having kids\" etc etc. I get it from my Mom, my coworkers, random people, etc. Wife gets it even more as a woman.\n\nI've never once walked up to a parent and been like \"you'll change your mind and wish you hadn't had kids\" or told a prospective parent \"if you have kids you'll regret it\".\n\nParents are often the preachy ones on this topic. People without kids for the most part just want to go about their business.\n\nI hold no resentment, malice, or judgement towards someone choosing to have kids. Power to you. All I expect is the same.\n\n> If she had the capacity to see the potential lost from abstaining from kids she wouldn\u2019t be doing it. \n\nHold on. Are you saying she's too ignorant to see what she's missing? That's such a condescending viewpoint to take. You are saying that people only choose to not have kids because we \"lack the capacity\" for something. \n\n> What if her kid was the next billionaire, would she regret it then?\n\nThat's a pretty dumb argument. What if her kid was the next Hitler? Even if they were the next billionaire, so what? What does that have to do with you? \n\nI just can't understand why you think people are somehow ignorant, flawed or misinformed for not wanting kids.",

As far as worrying about having people around me when I die, you assume I don't have a social network including my siblings, friends, neices and nephews (who fucking LOVE me) and whatever other cool people I meet along the way. Kids move away and people are alone when their spouse dies all the time, even if they have kids. Instead, I get to live a full, wonderful life where I actually get to devote my time and energy to my spouse. So if I die alone at least we lived life to the fullest. Also, the earth is already turning into a shit hole. Imagine when you die. You get to leave this earth knowing your kids might have inherited certain death. That's gotta be worse than being lonely.",

Despite this they would constantly try to lord over me because I wasn\u2019t married (yet) and told me I would be miserable and alone without kids. I was never miserable and never felt alone. I met my husband in my late thirties and we proceeded to travel and do whatever we felt like. The happier I was, the more the underhanded comments about \u201chow come no kids\u201d intensified. That legendary maternal instinct they claimed would kick in never did for me and not having kids was probably the best decision I ever made.

I love kids, don't get me wrong, but I know that they're not for me for the above reasons and more. \n\nLike, to parents who get petty with childfree people, don't get mad at us for taking the other route.

They\u2019re little sponges that are figuring the world out and come to their conclusions about stuff and it can be really cool watching them grow up. \n\nI will never shame people who don\u2019t want kids because I get it. However, it does irk me a little bit when people just jump on this idea that having kids is life ruining, and they drain all the fun from your life or \u201cprevent you from doing what you want\u201d. Is it true for some people? Yes, and it\u2019s sucks that they\u2019re in that spot and their kid is too, but it\u2019s not true overall! My daughter has opened up an entirely new subset of things I want to do! I have so many activities to do with her that bring me joy and I look forward to them every day. I still get to do all the previous things I did as well! Kids are a serious responsibility, yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are miserable. There\u2019s a lot of joy to be found if you\u2019re the person who wants to look for it",

If all you want to do to have a fulfilling life is have kids, go ahead, if you instead want to travel around and be single, go ahead, if you just want to have a partner and live quietly ever after, have at it!.\n\nStop being so freaking dense.",

              "text": "We are around small children a lot. My husband and I are childfree and being around small children so often is a huge reason as to why we have refused to have children. I watch the lives that parents live because of kids and nothing looks more boring. I'm an adult so I have absolutely zero interest in any activity or entertainment geared towards kids. So many parents are desperate for a \"date night\" so they can enjoy adult activities again for a short while. Many childfree couples can do whatever they want and whenever they want. We have the energy, time and money to live our own lives instead of living as caretakers for children. Being childfree is just that. We are free of children. Free to do as we wish or as we need. Honestly, the most interesting, well-rounded, intelligent, compassionate people I have ever known (and there are a lot) are or were (passed away) childfree and the sole reason they were or are so amazing is because they were fully able to dedicate their lives to their interests and charities. Parents' lives are hectic and chaotic and oftentimes they only have enough in them to take care of their kids. Some of them barely have enough time to even take a shower let alone be able to sit down and have a conversation about anything other than their children. Parents, especially new parents, are the most boring conversationalists I have ever spoken with because they can't keep up with anything or pursue their own goals and interests. All they do is spend time around children and children entertainment so the topics they bring to conversations are incredibly boring. It's far more interesting to learn a new language or travel or work with charities or pick up a new hobby than it is to watch the same episode of Paw Patrol for the sixth time in a row or do laundry at 3 in the morning because your child pissed the bed....again.\n\nI understand that my comment is a massive wall of text.

As a country's population declines, GDP growth may grow even more slowly or may even decline.  If the decline in total population is not matched by an equal or greater increase in productivity (GDP/capita), and if that condition continues from one calendar quarter to the next, it follows that a country would experience a decline in GDP, known as an economic recession.  If these conditions become permanent, the country could find itself in a permanent recession.\n\nOther possible negative impacts of a declining population are:\n\nA rise in the dependency ratio which would increase the economic pressure on the workforce\n\nA crisis in end of life care for the elderly because there are insufficient caregivers for them[23]\n\nDifficulties in funding entitlement programs because there are fewer workers relative to retirees[24]\n\nA decline in military strength[12]\n\nA decline in innovation since change comes from the young[24]\n\nA strain on mental health caused by permanent recession[25]\n\nDeflation caused by the ageing population[26]\n\nAll these negative effects could be summarized under the heading of \u201cUnderpopulation\u201d.  Underpopulation is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system.[27]\n\nPopulation decline can cause internal population pressures that then lead to secondary effects such as **ethnic conflict, forced refugee flows, and hyper-nationalism**.[28] This is particularly true in regions where different ethnic or racial groups have different growth rates.[29] An example of this is white nationalism. White nationalists seek to ensure the survival of the white race, and the cultures of historically white nations. Many white nationalists believe that white people should therefore maintain a demographic majority[30] and that mass immigration of non-whites and low birth rates among whites are threatening the white race.[31] Low fertility rates that cause long-term population decline can also lead to population ageing, an imbalance in the population age structure. **Population ageing in Europe due to low fertility rates has given rise to concerns about its impact on social cohesion**.[32]\n\n**A smaller national population can also have geo-strategic effects, but the correlation between population and power is a tenuous one.** Technology and resources often play more significant roles. Since World War II, the \"static\" theory saw a population's absolute size as being one of the components of a country's national power.[33] More recently, the \"human capital\" theory has emerged. This view holds that the quality and skill level of a labor force and the technology and resources available to it are more important than simply a nation's population size.[33] While there were in the past advantages to high fertility rates, that \"demographic dividend\" has now largely disappeared.[34]",

WHICH problem does that make them part of, again? \n\n   Has this egotistical know-it-all original poster person never heard about the kids who are perpetually STUCK in the government system? Kids who need parents? There are PLENTY of hopeful adoptees. \n\n   Why is somebody deciding NOT to have more kids of their own PART OF THE PROBLEM? I don't follow that logic at all. \n\n   There's at least one problem that means they are NOT part of, which is OVERPOPULATION. That is a nice thing to do for everybody else. Plus, if they don't feel like they are ready, that's intelligent of them not to push it. \n\n   They are not part of a problem where people have to syphon money off the government just to survive because they can't go to their own job, from being stuck at home because the kids are too young to go to school (that is a giant trap of a catch-22, I was part of that while growing up in a big family. I know that is rough on EVERYBODY involved, not just for some nit-picky adult who thinks they know better than everybody else). \n\n   Good lord, the nerve of some people who open their mouths without thinking first. Oh, well, First-World Problems, I guess.",

Eventually you recognize that there is a list of them, and they would use them in place of \u201ckids\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d, sometimes using several of them in a single comment, just to really drive home how disgusted by kids and parents who choose to have them. \n\nGranted, it wasn\u2019t like \u201cI hope your children die\u201d, or \u201cwe should exterminate children\u201d (as far as I know), but it was definitely hateful.\n\nEdit: I can see why this sub it would be considered hateful towards children and their parents.

These subs also tend to attract more extreme personalities but they usually get weeded out and banned fairly quickly.\n\nAs someone who is fairly active on childfree most of the terms like \"crotch fruit\" are said tongue in cheek. It's a bit of a running joke with very crude humor. I personally don't use those terms and can see why most people would find them offensive and distasteful.\n\nIf you do read through some posts and comments you will actually find many of those on r/childfree actually like children, but just don't want their own. Mostly complaining about society and family not accepting those choices.\n\nThere's some stuff I find goes too far though which puts me off (as with any sub of that type) but the general attitude the sub portrays towards kids is \"apathy\".",

And that's ok, but ... as I said... maybe you should to read about it more, not just from Wikipedia but actual academic sources.\n\nI'll give you a simple example... what you just said is akin to someone literally taking their last breath and you said 'but they're still breathing, right?'\n\n[According to our latest census, from July 1, 2019 to July 1, 2020, the USA grew by just 0.35%. This is the lowest annual growth rate since at least 1900.](https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-the-2020-census-will-reveal-about-america-stagnating-growth-an-aging-population-and-youthful-diversity/)\n\n[On the African continent, the number of children per woman has been decreasing for 40 years.](https://www.afd.fr/en/actualites/dramatic-drop-fertility-across-africa)\n\n[In China, the government is begging people to have more kids because their entire system is going to crash in a generation if they don't.](https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-beijing-s-baby-boosterism-china-s-population-growth-hits-new-low/6417261.html)\n\n[And this just about sums up the rest including Europe and India](https://www.euronews.com/2020/07/31/new-study-forecasts-the-eu-s-population-will-plummet-by-millions-more-than-expected)\n\nSo... now that I've done that much for you, I hope you'll do your own work so you don't make stupid statements like \"pOpUlAtIoN iS gRoWiNg ExPoNeNtIaLlY!\" \n\nP.S.

I knew at a very young age that I never wanted to have kids and did everything I could to avoid it, while having the time or my life during my twenties/thirties. I was by their standards, the loser that didn\u2019t grown up and start a family. Traveling and going on skate and snowboarding trips was way more interesting to me, than tee ball, soccer practice, and pta meetings. By the time thirty five rolled around, I had grown tired of hanging out in bars, and waking up in some girls bed that I hardly remembered talking to the night before. Luckily I didn\u2019t become an alcoholic, but did have some other health issues that forced me to quit drinking. Those last 1-2 years of my promiscuous drinking career, I started seeing all of the people that were just now starting to become barflies. All of them were now divorced at least once with kids ranging in age from 2-21. They all looked at least ten years older than me, and reeked of desperation. I still live right next door to one of the 8 bars in town, and will see them when I\u2019m walking my dog. I can\u2019t tell you how satisfying it is to \u201cKaren\u201d trying to not look 40, falling down drunk at 2pm on a Wednesday, hitting on some poor 21 year old kid who wants nothing to do with her. To any young people that have read this comment, life doesn\u2019t start getting fun until your early twenties. I recommend waiting to start a family so you don\u2019t become a single mother or father, trying to  pick up on mid twenty year olds. It\u2019s not a good look.",

What's more, the more people there are in general, the less value each person has to a potential employer, so wages suffer.

If you think having kids means you're gonna be stuck in the house and not be able to ever do anything doesn't understand you can bring your kids with you. I know every family is different but we've been bring our kids a long in most of our ventures and they love to tag a long. We still manage to find adult fun when we can and mostly never miss out. Their family loves them and is always open for them staying over on weekends if that's what they want to do.\n\nWe get compliments wherever we bring them on how well behaved and fun they like to be and I feel a lot of it has to do with keeping them engaged in the world with us and our friends/family. They play with their kids and we have great times, we don't stay caged in the house with them lol I understand every family is different once again but the more I read these posts the less it feels like \"I want to live my life my way\" and more like \"Fuck children, they're boring creatures that tie you down to a life of mundane boredom\"\n\nIts a hardcore personal opinion of mine that if you sit in your house all day not letting them meet people and have new experiences with you then you either feel like you have to drink/do drugs to have fun and theyre keeping that from you or you just dont actually like kids. Children are great and I wouldn't know how to be without mine. Much love to all",

I love my son, and holding him is one of my new favorite activities. It is difficult, and I do have less time for other things, but for me, it's worth to get to see this little guy grow.\n\nFor those choosing to be parents, it's important to make sure you are financially capable of doing so; not just for your child, but for yourselves. My wife and I made sure that we were in a financially stable position to care for him and meet his needs without worrying which bills we'd pay every month.\n\nIt seems people get a little too caught up in the perceived moral superiority of choosing or foregoing parenthood, when in reality, there's nothing wrong with either so long as you're making the right decision for yourself, and doing so responsibly. \n\nThat's just my two cents.",
