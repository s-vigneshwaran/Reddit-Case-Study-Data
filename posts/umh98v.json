                      "text": "Yeah, I think you're referring to *Three Identical Strangers,* about a set of identical triplets and several other sets of twins who were all deliberately separated from their siblings when they were six months old; they were then adopted into very different households as part of an experiment focusing on whether their different environments would be the major influence on their psycho-social development, or if their identical genetic profiles would ultimately be the major influence. Basically the \"nature vs. nurture\" issue. \n\n\nIt's such an interesting case, though. Like the triplets in that documentary just met one another completely by accident when they were in college, and then they eventually uncovered that they had been part of this wild study. Prior to that, they didn't even know that they were triplets or that they had any biological siblings at all. \n\nThe ethical ramifications of psycho-social experiments of that era were often extremely dubious, though, and that kind of experiment would *never* be permitted today, due to all of the ethical issues that were involved. Like the lack of informed consent; the fact that the true nature of the experiment was kept completely secret from *everyone;* the fact that none of the families were ever told that their kids were part of twin/triplet sets; the fact that the siblings were separated only *after* they had already bonded for several months; the fact that the adoption agency secretly conspired to orchestrate this study without ever even *attempting* (and certainly never intending) to place the twins/triplets together in a single adoptive household, which, if possible, would have obviously been in their best interest; the fact that when the agency was questioned later on, they continued to hide the existence of the experiment and lied about their own actions; the fact that *many* of these children had been born to parents who suffered from serious mental health issues, which is something that the researchers and adoption agency both deliberately hid from the adoptive families (possibly because they wanted to determine whether mental illness was learned or inherited); and then mental illnesses actually began to manifest in *most* of the children as they reached adolescence, with absolutely no warning, treatment, or guidance being offered on the part of the researchers (who were trained psychologists) or the adoption agency. \n\nThe biggest issue is just that the integrity of the experiment itself was basically prioritized over the welfare of those children, even as it became increasingly apparent that they were struggling. Even before the experiment was uncovered, when the kids were still teens/young adults, many of them had been admitted into psychiatric facilities for treatment (sometimes repeatedly), and *several* of them even ended up committing suicide. At some point when the kids were still very young, the researchers had actually noted (within their own research notes) that the early signs of mental illness were beginning to manifest among some of the children and that the parents did not seem to recognize those red flags -- and yet the researchers still deliberately chose *not* to alert the adoptive parents about those early warning signs of mental illness *and* they continued to hide the fact that the kids had a family history of mental illness (which the adoption agency also hid). If they *had* disclosed any of that information/context, and then attempted to provide some kind of treatment or guidance early on, then...who knows? It could have provided a better outcome for some of those kids.\n\nI think the documentary is on Hulu now btw, if anyone is interested. Sorry for the very long rant, I just think it's a really fascinating case for anyone interested in the ethics/history of psycho-social experiments and the roles of mental illness and family dynamics in the whole \"nature vs. nurture\" debate. I've discussed it in some of the anthropology/sociology courses that I've taught, and it was one of those \"what **NOT** to do\" cases that we presented as we were exploring the ethical considerations of human experiments. It's still a shame that the results of that study were never published or shared, though, and that the lead researcher had ordered that the files remain sealed for another 60 years after his death (so *no one* can gain access to them until like 2065). So the people who were unwittingly roped into this experiment and even suffered because of it can't even get any solid answers as to *why* the study was conducted in this way, what the ultimate goal and results really were, what it accomplished, or even *how many* twin/triplet sets were actually studied. It's just a wild story.",

So she had been having a bad go at things, and we were just trying to keep her comfortable in her old age. One day she got out, and, being she was sick and old and a farm dog, figured she just went off to die alone.\n\nThis is of course sad as I would have preferred to be with her in her final moments like most people would, and now I had to explain to my four year old what death was, all the stuff that goes along with it, etc.. He took it pretty well but was of course crying a lot of pretty sad for a few days.  Then as it does, it got better, we talked a lot about her and I had a ton of puppy photos of her on my computer and we'd sit and I'd show him photos and explain what was going on in them, then he'd draw pictures of her doing things in 'dog heaven' which is a concept he just sort of came up with, I never actually said she went to dog heaven but whatever, it's fine.\n\nWeek later I walk outside and she's just fucking standing on the back porch like nothing happened. SO after all this death talk, grieving, coping, moving on the only lesson he got out of this is \"hey sometimes they come back.\" Then she lived for another year and half barking at stationary objects not knowing what the fuck was going on but in generally good health. No idea where she was during that time, I looked everywhere for her too for like three days.",

When he was sat at the back of the room, an old geezer came over to him and said a few words (\"thank you for coming. It means a lot\" etc.) before leaving. When they later approached the open casket to pay respects, the deceased was the same bloke that had sat with him earlier! The kid was so spooked he didn't tell anyone what happened and he spent the next 30-odd years of his life believing he'd seen a ghost. \n\nAs an adult he finally sat down with his dad and told him what had happened. Turns out the deceased had an identical twin brother who had been at the funeral that day.",

I was taken aback and just blurted out \"I um, live here. I didn't technically have a choice\"\n\nShe laughed and thanked me anyway. Seemed to be the only laugh she had that day.",

I pointed this oddity out to my mother who proceeded to initiate a friendly, light-hearted conversation with this doppelganger who is my grandfather's brother. Despite living in the same town and getting along, my grandparents and parents never introduced him to myself or my siblings nor did they ever mention that my grandfather and his brother look eerily similar. I took a picture to show my siblings and cousins and they were all likewise flabbergasted. To this day whenever someone brings it up, my mother says, \"I don't know what the big deal is, you knew your grandfather was dead.\" Like, yes. Exactly. That's why it's such a big deal. I don't often see ghosts at the post office.",

Imagine his surprise when I told him his parent's didn't remarry; his mom married both brothers.  His mom was confused as to why my ex was understandably upset that no one had told him his dad had a twin. Mom's defense...it was common knowledge that there were two of them. Second side note... if you want a deaf person to know something TELL THEM!  Third side note...if you have a deaf child LEARN TO SIGN!!! It's not that hard.  Oops! I'm on my soapbox. Sorry.  Anyway...years later he saw both men at the same time and they all had a good laugh about it. So that's good.",

I once listened to him talk about his experience in WWII for over two hours, and all he did was watch over a dock in Hawaii after Pearl Harbor.\n\nBut he never said a word about his family.\n\nWe did get him to talk about his dad once, who apparently died when my Granddad was young in a construction accident, but his mom? Brothers? Sisters? Relatives? Nothing. Far as he was concerned, my Grandmother and his kids were his family and that was that. There were rumors that something had happened between him and the rest of his family that caused a rift, but nobody had details and my Granddad refused to talk about it.\n\nA few weeks after he died, an old woman showed up at my Grandmother's place and introduced herself as my Granddad's sister. At first we thought she was crazy, since she lived nearby and knew where my Grandparents lived but never showed up until now, but she knew things about my Granddad that people wouldn't normally know and she never tried to scam us or anything. Just a nice old woman who we sort of regretted not meeting until now.\n\nSadly, she was almost as tight-lipped about her family as my Granddad, and wouldn't go into details about  why she had avoided us until now. She passed about two years later, and nobody else came forward after her.\n\nAs far as we know, what happened has gone to both of their graves and it'll forever remain a mystery to us.",

It takes me back to when I was a kid. I still hated him. Same hair, same face, same build, same mannerisms. Immediately soured the mood. Then I realize this was impossible, the fucker is gone. \n\nNah it turns out it\u2019s his eldest son. Who he had no hand in raising bc he left the family he created (the first of three that he did that to). And this cousin of mine comes over and gives his condolences\u2026 and his eyes were different. *Kind*. I\u2019ll never forget that moment, seeing the laugh lines at the corners.
