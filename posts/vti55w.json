Conservative justices cited the organization\u2019s brief in the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe activist, \u201ca prominent Capitol Hill religious leader,\u201d Rolling Stone reports, \u201cwas caught on a hot mic making a bombshell claim: that she prays with sitting justices inside the high court. \u2018We\u2019re the only people who do that,\u2019 Peggy Nienaber said.\u201d\n\nCalling the disclosure \u201ca serious matter on its own terms,\u201d Rolling Stone says it \u201calso suggested a major conflict of interest. Nienaber\u2019s ministry\u2019s umbrella organization, Liberty Counsel, frequently brings lawsuits before the Supreme Court. In fact, the conservative majority in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health, which ended nearly 50 years of federal abortion rights, cited an amicus brief authored by Liberty Counsel in its ruling.\u201d",

If one side should decide to jettison their adherence to the rules the system falls apart because you can\u2019t have democracy and rigid rules.

Taking massive swipes at power is a double edged sword and could just as easily accelerate us towards the total totalitarian hellscape that republuican fascists want. Just as an example, not only would a massive eminent domain play _deeply_ alienate people who fundamentally value individual liberty and personal property (a shit load of people on the center left side) and also probably not do what you think it would, but you're also giving Republican Governors a complete green light to start brazenly stealing property from people in Republican run states so they can sell the land to private developers.\n\nI completely agree that institutional Democrats are complicit cowards, but very rarely do we have problems that can be solved by just one or two simple plans. It ALWAYS takes longer to unfuck something than it did to fuck it.",

Biden hasn't been great in his career in politics, not just as the President, but I don't doubt he believes in the system and I have faith that he would appoint new judges much more fairly than anyone has before, primarily based on how he spoke of senator McCain when he passed and how he speaks of McConnell in recent months. It seems he still believes that there are Republicans who are trying to do what's best for the people they represent rather than what's best for themselves and trump, seems far to rare to me.",

But any thing like mayor or city Council or anything like that I can't vote on because I'm not within the city limits. And I can't really even vote blue because I got to look at the sample ballot for the last round of elections and there was like six people on the Democrat ticket two or three of which where running for governor if I remember correctly compared to the republicans forty or forty five. So it really just doesn't feel like it's worth it.",

Reps actively make the world worse, and you're poo poo'ing Dems because they didn't get enough votes to stop Reps from stonewalling legislation in the senate. Like seriously\n\nI think Dems are shitscum that act as a barrier to enacting proper change, but realistically, right this moment they're the best we got for stopping Reps from turning the US into Gilead. Complaining that voting a couple times didn't lead to change for the better is being willfully ignorant of the situation at hand",

They won't say \"garsh, I guess we lost\" and go home. They call 5 years of confederacy \"culture\". In 100 years I'm sure there will still be Trump 2020 flags being waved right next to confederate flags as part of how their culture has been stripped from them. There is no reasoning with these people. They will choose violence over defeat. They want to see this happen in their lifetimes. Voting is great but I don't see dems implementing laws and punishments for what the GOP has done to this country. We have all the evidence in the world of Trump actively inciting a coup and yet I'm sure most of us think he will never see the inside of a jail cell. If all voting does is painfully delay the inevitable nazi march off a political cliff and life already sucks, why do it?  You have to see it from the perspective of those who have already lost hope.",

The internet will reveal all you need to know but also make sure its a reliable source.\n\nThats what i do with every election of any type. Never just go with ur party, ive said yes to some repubs and yes to some dems hell even yes to green party. Your vote is your voice and it will always matter, even if your person doesnt win it still matters.\n\nTldr: research ALL people and dont vote for someone just because you are red or blue.",

Just writing letters and going to the odd event to get my opinion out there in a smart and informed manner is all I can do, but I like to think that more people will eventually get into this as well. \n\nThe choice unfortunately is between religious nut jobs and their enablers who just seek to get rich, and a group of both lazy/entitled centrists but also a growing number of activist types in the Bernie\u2019s and younger AOCs. Get involved at a local level and it can gradually build national momentum. \n\nI also remind myself that nothing happens overnight. Republicans haven\u2019t destroyed the US overnight, it\u2019s been multiple elections in the works. Dems have to similarly plan for multiple cycles and not get discouraged if they fall short and have another 4 years like the Biden presidency where he\u2019s effectively fucked from day one thanks to pretend progressive like that POS from AZ. \n\nAs a realist I\u2019d also consider learning to shoot and handle a number of firearms safely because it may not be that far off that you need to defend yourself and your freedom from people who think their church belongs in your life.",

There is no appeal of a vote by Congress on the subject. The House is the sole arbiter. They can  vote to impeach because the office holder had eggs for breakfast and it would be a valid impeachment with nobody having any say about it (except the Supreme Court which would pose a fascinating constitutional crisis were the House to impeach the entire Court and the Court to attempt to declare it unconstitutional and ignore it).\n\nLikewise, to convict and remove the office holder from office requires a 2/3rds vote of the Senate and, once again, there is nobody who can do anything about the vote. They can vote yes or no, for any reason.\n\nImpeachment is not a legal remedy. It is a political remedy. One that has never been used against a Supreme Court Justice and it is likely there never will be a successful removal of a Supreme Court Justice (which, parenthetically, means our government really doesn\u2019t have 3 equal branches of government; SCOTUS has unequalled and unrestrained power to say the law is whatever they say it is - with the only check on that power being an impeachment process that has exactly zero chance of ever removing a SCOTUS member). \n\nWelcome to American democracy.",

It was founded to show students \u201chow God can use them as judges, law professors and practicing attorneys to help keep the door open for the spread of the Gospel in America. The Blackstone program is run by Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal advocacy group whose founding leader has questioned the \u201cso-called separation of church and state\u201d as it is often understood. In the years Barrett spoke there, the fellowship\u2019s suggested reading list included a book co-written by the same leader that lamented how Christians for too long had been \u201cAWOL from the courthouse.\u201d\n\n\nA fundamentalist, religious minority rule has come to America in the highest court of the land and it\u2019s there to stay.",

Openly aligning oneself with a reactionary & obscurantist group with questionable opinions should be grounds to invalidate any judge's ruling and to boot said judge off the court.\n\nYou can be religious and still follow the law, logic & reason.  Only in the USA can you have judges that are no different than the taliban, daesh or some shaman from the bush.\n\nIt's infuriating that republicans have rigged the whole system to the point where they can reverse decades of settled law because they can, using beyond questionable reasoning and \"jurisprudence\" (seriously, basing a SCOTUS ruling on the questionable opinions of a 17th-century \"jurist\" who was considered a weirdo in his time?) without any repercussion. I've seen idiots blaming Biden for not preventing that, instead of looking at moscow mitch & the federalist society.  The game is so rigged that democrats, not even Saint Bernie or AOC, could do anything about it.\n\nTeam (R) has been acting like vandals and toxic abusers for *decades* and getting away with it.

It is really worth reading the whole article at RollingStone.\n\nTurns out  the christofascists have been using prayer to lobby the justices under the guise of \"ministry\" for about 30 years.   Scalia was part of it.\n\nOne thing that stood out to me is that RS interviewed a bunch of legal experts and they basically all said its not a big deal because justices gotta be able to hang out and socialize with people just like normal people do.  FDR played cards with a couple of justices back in his day, so its all good.  But when RS interviewed the guy who had been running the organization for nearly 30 years, he basically straight-up said that the only reason he was even there was to persuade the justices to rule the way he wanted them to.  \n\nThe difference between theory and practice, the ivory tower and fighting down in the muck, couldn't have been more stark.\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/roe-supreme-court-justices-1378046/",

Fuck religion and fuck you for being stupid and gullible enough to believe in it if you do.

This was a states rights issue, the feds do not have authority to create \"rights\" out of thin air that do not exist in the constitution. There is not and never has been a right in the constitution to commit infanticide. It started with abortion up to a certain number of weeks gestation, and after people got used to this standardit moved to where we are now, we are at the point that people, (such as Gov Northam comments), are openly talking about murdering a fully formed human baby after it is birthed. What about rape and incest? Less than 1% of any abortion is related to a rape, less than 1/2 of 1% are related to incest which means 99% are because of convenience because people behave irresponsibly. We live in the era of morning after pills that can prevent unwanted pregnancies so there is no reason to allow this atrocity to continue \"for convenience\". Condoms, ied's, vasectomies, tubilagations, and adoptions are all valid alternatives to infanticide. BTW the history of planned Parenthood is a history of racist eugenics against blacks and was created by an openly racist woman with the intent of erasing the black population which is why the first abortion clinics, and the vast majority of abortion clinics are in minority areas.",

States are much more likely to ignore the separation of church and state and that's exactly what they rely on.

Religious ideology while we don't agree with it should be treated the same way, it's a principle of the US constition and the founding father intended it that way. \n\nIf you dot want religion in politics, the best way to do is to prove the religions wrong enough to convert people to atheism.",
