  "text": "TIFU I thought all dudes observed the clean butt etiquette when they get BJs\nI see a guy in my building to give him the occasional BJ when he\u2019s in the mood but the women he\u2019s casually dating are all unavailable. It\u2019s all fun and games. Nothing serious. I go over, get on my knees, we both leave happy. \n\nSo today while giving him a very sloppy service, he decided to straddle my face and make me lick his ass. I mean, I have done it once or twice. It\u2019s not my first choice or second choice on the menu. But he seemed like he really wanted it, and I thought doing it would distract him from wanting to anal me, as he had stealthily moved from squeezing my butt cheeks to fingering my butt during BJ. I was not ready for anal.\n\nSo I let him squat over my face and plant his butt crack squarely on my face. I assumed all guys observed the clean butt etiquette when they get BJs. The BJ to ball licking to taint licking to butt licking transition happens enough that I assumed every guy cleans the entire pelvic region before a BJ session. \n\nI assumed incorrectly. I screamed into his ass canyon but my screams were muffled. I got out from under him so fast. I didn\u2019t want to look at him. I didn\u2019t want to talk about it. I saw his tightie whitie on the floor as I left, looking down to avoid any eye contact, and noticed the skid marks. The sight of it made me puke a little acid bile in my mouth. \n\nTo top it off, on my way back to my unit, I had to wear a mask in the elevator, which only amplified the scent of his unclean ass. It was a no for me. 0/10. Do not recommend. \n\nTL;DR: I assumed all men observed the clean ass etiquette when they make their partners lick their butts. I was wrong.\n\nUpdate 1: I just can\u2019t stand awkwardness and I was pretty rude the way I ran out. I messaged him to apologize and clarified it was a hygiene issue, which he claimed he wasn\u2019t aware of (how?). Anyway, I told him it wasn\u2019t my favorite on the menu, but willing to do it if he cleaned thoroughly. Turns out he wanted to eat me out mostly, but thought he could only do it if he let me do it first. I clarified for him that he can feel free to dine out on my butthole and finger me all he wants. I don\u2019t feel the need or desire to reciprocate. Just no anal yet. Communication and friendship re-established.\n\nUpdate 2: Also, all these chat messages calling me derogatory names are stupid. You don\u2019t know me. Be nice to others. Thanks.",

If you can\u2019t see the difference then I can\u2019t help you. Men get to wear comfortable clothes, forego most hair removal, don\u2019t have to wear makeup, etc etc - so its not as much of a stretch that a dude wouldnt wash his butthole. A woman? She\u2019s already waxed, liplined, and standing on 4 inch heels. Yes obviously there\u2019s variations to this and some women dont participate in that and still get dates (hi, me) but overall, we have to put a lot more work into it all",

I tried a bidet once, not on purpose of course, but I was in Asia and I hit the wrong button. You know how the experience was? Ineffective. Sure I could have sat there an extra 30 seconds to achieve a job I could have done in two swipes, but I don't have the spare time to get water blasted up my rectum and feel good about myself. The arguments I hear from bidet boys range from how much more comfortable it feels on their baby skin o-rings, to how it somehow makes you cleaner. If you mean wetter, then yes it does, but just because you're so ineffective at doing a task that most children master in their fifth year at life doesn't mean the rest of us have assholes as literally shitty as yours.\n\nGod I hate biddets.",

I even thanked a guy with a genuine smile on my face after they've shot a load into my mouth as that's my favorite, but he seemed confused which made it a bit awkward so now I try hide my eagerness somewhat so they don't think I'm weird and not let me suck them again.",

Those sound like reasonable explanations to the phenomenon. \n\nBut I wonder if higher sex drives and heteronormativity comprehensively explain it? \n\nThe gay identity seems to be intertwined with sexual expression. It\u2019s rare you meet gay people with a low sex drive. I would say more rare than in hetero demographics. Attitudes towards sex seem more hyper charged than those of hetero men, even when you take into account the effects of heteronormativity. I\u2019ll have to look into studies of this I assume they exist. \n\nWhich is NOT to say there is not risky promiscuous behavior among hetero men. Only to say that the identity of hetero men does not seem to be highlighted as brightly by attitudes towards sex and  defined as sharply by an expression of risky sexual behavior as is with gay men. And I\u2019m not sure that claim A is strong enough to explain this *solely* on its own.",

I have never been much of a random hookup guy, but on this particular day a few years back, I was in the mood for one. On to Grindr I went, and after a bit, found a willing partner. I invited him over, and he said that he was just going to grab a shower and would head over. I was excited, as I had broken up with my ex a few months prior and hadn't sought out any action since then. So after a bit he arrived, we greeted each other and went up to my room. Now I never just jump right into the deed, as I like to talk for a bit and get a feel for who the person is. I wanna make certain I'm not dealing with a crazy. We talked for about 15 mins then I initiated kissing and we were off. Fast forward I am blowing this dude, and doing a damn good job I must add, when he asks me to eat his ass. As OP said, it's not my favorite thing, but I had done it with my exes who were always very clean. I contribute that to them being bottoms, which I came to find this guy lied about being, so I agreed. I got down there and could not believe the stench emanating from this guys hole, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I got in a few seconds before I simply had to stop. I came back up and quickly said, \"Hey, wanna suck my dick now?\" By the look on his face I think he must have understood. I made sure the rest of the encounter didn't last longer than it had to, and sent him on his way. I vowed never to eat ass again, and to all future boyfriends, you can blame that guy.",

I understand if someone is obsessively concerned about physical touch and/or germs, but to say eating ass is gross is wrong. Maybe not your thing. But ass eaters are everywhere, exchanging contact and you don't even know it. They might shake your hand, they might kiss you, they might even have sex with you. Who knows? So be clean.

Not only have I grown up with baby wipes (I mean once you go with the wipes, paper seems so outdated), but I always **cleaned the inside of my asshole**. As in I wipe my butt cheeks around my asshole and then **stick my finger** (with the baby wipe obv) **inside my asshole for a few centimeters to clean it throughly**. \n\nNo idea why I did this since I was a toddler and my mom never specifically taught me this. The only thing that's special about me is that because Autism or something my mom had to wipe my ass until I was 4 or 6, even though I could already pee at the age of 3. I always found people who got a toothbrush up theirs to be so pretentious if they talked about the pain since I REALLY FUCKING THOUGHT EVERYBODY WAS DOING IT LIKE THIS lmao. In case anyone wants to know, no I don't like fingering my ass and I used to find pooping a bad experience since it did hurt a bit when I was younger (now it's not that bad anymore, it doesn't sting anymore since I was 13 or something).\n\nI found out about a year ago when talking to someone and I was so embarrassed. You know the worst part? I can't go back. I tried only wiping my ass but for some reason I still feel a dirty asshole. I guess this might be some girl's kink dream (although I wouldn't like having my asshole licked, I do like it the other way around however).",

I didn't discover my lust for dicks until later in my teens when I first found porn that my brother left my laptop which he forgot to close, and promptly used the website to look up guys instead, in which I promptly began to imagine myself as the one on my knees giving head, fantasizing about how good dick and cum would taste. Being a hypersexual gay has had its ups and downs; growing up it was definetly terrible, as in situations where other guys would have to strip near me, I'd avoid looking like it was the plague as I was terrified of being unable to avoid staring and get exposed.\n\nAs an adult it has made it somewhat challenging for me to find guys to blow as the gay scene here is pretty limited and I'd likely get decked in the face if I went up to a random hot guy and offered to blow him, but I'd probably have it worse as a straight guy if I was as horny as I am now, seeing as most girls doesn't seem to care about blowjobs. I sometimes wish I was a girl just so I could have way easier time finding someone to blow, but I imagine once i finally find either a friend with benefits or boyfriend to give as many blowies as I need to then I'll finally have an outlet for my cravings. Hope this was informative, there's a lot I had to leave out but I didn't want this to be way too long :P",

No idea of how other guys think of this, but...just make sure it's clean....maybe add a wipe at least..???\n\n2) Can't say that I've had the \"roaming\" aspect, though that may be me...am deffo more of a giver, and more of a marathon-than-sprint sort of guy means being expected to finish quickly [and not] adds pressure, which doesn't help with desire to....that said, still see 1) above for clarification..\n\n3) Gonna have to repeat 1) here, and go back to it being a general standard...\n\n>Update 1a: I messaged him to apologize and clarified it was a hygiene issue, which he claimed he wasn\u2019t aware of (how?).\n\nPerhaps he just had an \"over zealous\" fart and didn't realise the \"echo\"...??? (Gross: yes....but can happen if not careful - hence the \"never trust a fart\" type phrase..)\n\n>Update 1b: Turns out he wanted to eat me out mostly, but thought he could only do it if he let me do it first. I clarified for him that he can feel free to dine out on my butthole and finger me all he wants.\n\nHehehe....same as me (see above about being a giver more than a receiver) though have zero requirement for it to be given to me first.....\n\nPersonally, and admittedly on a considerable tangent, it's like me being a scuba diver [which I am] but wanting you to try this diving thing we haven't done yet...if you like it, then I'll give it a go......\n\nReminds me of a couple of recurring comments that my girlfriend has asked: what do I get from it...and why do I enjoy it so much..??\n\n\u2022 Was going to add my responses to her, but will leave that for now....\n\n>Update 2: Also, all these chat messages calling me derogatory names are stupid.

I would agree that the identity of lesbians seems to be less intertwined with sex and sexual expression.\n\nReally goes to show how all of our supposedly solid and foundational \u201cidentities\u201d are leashed by hormones, chemical reactions, matter, and general biology.\n\nI will say your claim seems to suggest that hetero men would be more promiscuous and less risk aversive if women were more willing (huge duh) but my question has more to do with \u201cwhat is it about the gay male experience that uniquely seems to color their identity with unrelenting sexual urges?\u201d \n\nIf women were suddenly more open to sex I don\u2019t believe hetero men would come to be largely defined by an exaggerated sexual exuberance. Even if you factor in generations of repression it seems unlikely but maybe that\u2019s just me unable to understand. I guess when you think about hetero men can be quite exuberant when it comes to sex. The Mongolians come to mind as well as stories like those of King Solomon and Alexander the Great.",

In many ways the gay subculture is a reaction to the mainstream culture demonizing and discriminating against them for so long. They were in part also defined sexually by the mainstream cultures disgust. \n\nThis is where the language and pathology of todays politics quickly is unmasked as being too simple to explain. Sexuality, like our morals, attitudes, values and religious/spiritual beliefs is no different: they all are in flux and change with the culture and political economy of the age. Which is why it\u2019s so backwards and untruthful to say people are largely \u201cborn gay or straight.\u201d We are quick to forget our human history and too quick to assume matter and nature does not precede identity.",
