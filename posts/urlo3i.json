If their goal is to offer abortion services in states where abortion is not illegal, it doesn't matter whether it's a religious ritual.\n\nAs I understand it, they're trying to set up (or people think they're trying to set up) a legal argument that their members have a right to obtain an abortion as a religious ritual and it's a violation of their first amendment freedom of religion to prevent that.\n\nThe OP is correct, I think, that this won't work. There is already precedent that's pretty on point for this, and it establishes a test for determining whether a government action that prevents someone from practicing a religious ritual is okay or not. The short version is that if a law generally bans an action for everyone, then you aren't exempt from that ban even if it infringes on your religious practice. \n\nThis came up in a case about native Americans suing for the right to use peyote. The Court basically said we can't just let people get around legal bans on things by saying their religion requires them to do it, or the law would basically cease to have a purpose.",

The government cannot prosecute anyone for abortion. Abortion has remained illegal in Texas, but the government is not able to enforce it because the supreme court has said so.\n\nTexas' new law allows any Texas resident to sue any other Texas resident for assisting in any way with an abortion for a minimum of $10,000 plus legal fees, regardless of whether the person suing has any relation to the person who had the abortion. Those assisting with the abortion would include any doctors and nurses involved, but is also vague enough to include the front desk person at the clinic, the person who drove the pregnant person to the abortion center, the pharmacist who filled the prescription, or even someone who lets a pregnant person use their phone to call an abortion clinic.\n\nThe original Roe v Wade decision says that the government cannot prosecute someone for having an abortion because they have a fundamental right to choose whether to have an abortion without government restrictions. The decision was more about privacy than abortion. Texas'new abortion law gets around this because they're not restricting anyone's right to choose have an abortion, they're allowing citizens to sue others for assisting with an abortion.\n\nTST is now trying to say that abortion is a protected religious ritual. They're claiming that a satanic pregnant person and any other satanic people have the religious freedom to participate in the satanic ritual of abortion. In a way this is similar to the claim that the lawyers for Jane Roe had made in that it involves one's own freedoms, but this time it's about religious freedom and it extends out to anyone who participates.",

If RvW gets overturned, abortion will become illegal in some states, and people having the abortion or those who help would be able to be prosecuted for their part in it. I believe this is the current status of assisted suicide in the US, but because it's very sick people in a lot of pain with a death sentence diagnosis, nobody really goes after anyone assisting in the usually illegal act of suicide. When it comes to what the right sees as baby murder, I have a feeling they will be much more active on prosecuting, and TST saying it's a ritual won't protect anyone.",

This isn't about you as a person or your personal decisions; you left because it was best for you and despite my opinionated take on your words I do respect that decision. You had to leave your country behind. I don't know about you, but that wouldn't be painless for me. \n\nI'm just saying that even if you don't mean it from a place of superiority, that's how it comes off. You sound as if you're lecturing people who are actually making an effort to challenge these decisions instead of being supportive.  It was I mean they legit built a religious institute for the specific purpose of challenging laws and legal decisions on behalf of the secular people of our country. They're the good guys. It comes off very combative and unsupportive to act like they're not helping people instead of just talking about making more of an effort as a separate thread of discussion. It's hard to fault anyone for saying we need to do more over here, but we also don't need to belittle actual efforts to point that out, y'know?",

The prayer is being banned specifically because it is an expression of religion, on the theory that the constitutional prohibition on establishment of a state religion trumps the right to free exercise of religion.\n\nThe issue of practicing abortion as a religious ritual in a state where it's banned, by contrast, is about whether or not the right to freely express one's religion outweighs laws banning abortion. In this case, abortion is not being banned because it's an expression of religion\n\nThere's already pretty on-point precedent for this issue in a case called *Employment Division v. Smith*, saying that if a law prohibits the exercise of religion only incidentally and it is otherwise a valid and generally applicable law (that is to say, it affects people regardless of their religion and it's valid to enforce it on anyone else that does not claim it prohibits exercise of their religion), then you can't get a religious exemption from it.",

The amendment must then be ratified by three-fourths of the State legislatures, or three-fourths of conventions called in each State for ratification.\n\n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/our-government/the-constitution/#:~:text=An%20amendment%20may%20be%20proposed,in%20each%20State%20for%20ratification.\n\nIn general an amendment passes though both houses first then goes to the states for ratification. I am not sure if a convention has ever been called the states to put an amendment in place.\n\n>By you logic, states could still have segregation because the civil rights act isn\u2019t in the constitution.\n\nAgain, you need a civics lesson. I was referring to the power of the Supreme Court that can only rule something constitutional or unconstitutional in general. That is thier pourpose. No, the states can not ignore a federal law. The point of stating it should be an amendment is that it takes it out of the Supreme courts hands. If it is in the constitution, it is prima facie constitutional.",

I certainly do not want a single dime of my hard-earned tax money going for any religious purpose whatsoever.\n\nWhile I  agree that the Satanic Temple is probably correct in \"having their designs ready\" too, I only say that because I do understand they are doing that in order to hopefully prevent the other piece of shit decals.\n\nThat said however, I also do oppose the Satanic Temple's request as well.  As I have said before, religion is a goddamn virus and should be opposed completely.

Since there is equal protection under the law, if one religion is able to do something through the government, all need to be able to do the same.\n\nSo, when Christians act entitled, and do things like put the ten commandments on the courthouse steps, the Temple comes along and demand's their equal rights to a display as well.\n\nThat puts the Christians in a position where they have to remove the Christian ornament or have their ornament right next to a statue of a goat headed demon.\n\nThe optimal solution is for the Christian ornament to be removed, thus respecting the no establishment of religion part of the first amendment.  Therefore making the one that has to sit next to theirs as unpalatable to them as possible is the way to go.\n\n\nAfter all, had they not acted in a way that violated the 1st amendment in the first place, they would not be in the position where the Temple would be requesting equal treatment.",
