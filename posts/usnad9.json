Made around $25.00+ an hour during my 3 year apprenticeship. \n\nI finished my hours and passed my red seal exam and was a journeyman bricklayer before I turned 24. I got a job at our local steel plant on their masonry crew the next year and started at $35.00 an hour. I'm 37 now and make $40.00+ an hour with guaranteed OT and amazing benefits. \n\nI have literally 0 highschool credits.",

The Mgmt degree makes you more employable.\n\nSTEM degrees are the exception to this. You won\u2019t have a problem getting a job with a STEM degree.",

(Luckily though we never had perfect attendance in that class so we rarely hit the max.)\n\nThis went on for the almost the entire 1st semester before it was broken up. My school gets brand new counselors every year that break the master schedule regularly. Combine that with the district switching to a terrible new management program called aeries. \n\nThe delay was because an AP teacher was throwing a fit at being forced to teach 1 on-level class. He had about 4 sections of his AP class without 7-10 students in each class. So they combined those classes together and he was pissed about it.",

Her next job of any amount of time is for a small NZ company before she turns to work for the schools. That woman would be considered a very educated hire. She isn\u2019t. She has a poor education and questionable job history, but qualified and educated candidates don\u2019t stay or return to Memphis. \n\nAs someone who went to WSHS and then left, I will say I still have a 901 number and get political calls. I looked one up once. She owned a hair business that went bankrupt. She won.

If they dont use it then it rolls over and gets added to the next year if they do use it then somebody should be checking how its being used. Hire a few extra employees to oversee large expenditures and save billions across the board. The money that rolls over gets reallocated to other departments or organizations depending on where its needed at the time and if theres a surplus its fed back into the system to be used elsewhere. The compartmentalisation of government departments with no interdepartmental communication is also a huge issue.\n\nI think the biggest issue is the lack of oversight on budget expenditure. Once budgets are decided theyre forgotten and the money is written off. That's not ok. Before/after photos should be kept on record for things like renovations. Before something of value is destroyed/replaced a photo of it and simple description/reason allocated. A little bit of extra work sure but were talking crazy amounts of money overall and it can be quickly checked during yearly audits by a small oversight team at the higher level.\n\nIm not saying its easy but it can definitely be done better and lots of small changes over time will make all the difference.",

Hey that's cool man.\n\nAs said above (and apologies if I mistakenly call the religious centers by the wrong name), I've gone to mosques, a Buddhist temple, Hindu temples, a synagogue, several Catholic ~~aerobics~~masses, and numerous Baptist/Christian/all that.\n\nIn my experiences, at least in America, the Christian churches were the only ones to actively judge everyone, treat you and everyone else like you've done wrong already and need redemption, calling non-believers sinners and that they're going to Hell etcetc.\n\nEverywhere else treated my big white ass like I was a guest and they wanted to teach about their traditions and show what this meant or that meant, if I didn't know or understand something, no one was pissy about it, often there was jokes and laughter. Each place had such an interesting, welcoming vibe to it - and there was a surprising amount of free food shoved at me lol.\n\nI'm not much of a fan of organized religion in general oweing to history, but if you asked me where the most hate in religion comes from, at least here in America, it's from Christianity.",

Private school teachers aren\u2019t the devil though, so take your kids out of public education and and pay some rich dude money to teach your kids that creationism is the real truth.\n\nAs a former teacher, I find it highly alarming how quickly the GOP has pretty much set up the the dismantling of the entire Dept of Education. The teachers payment is definitely one of the top offenses, right under the fact that schools are just casually seen as possible war zones now, but the problems of our education system are deep and vast. The standards have been slowly hollowed out over the last 20 years or so, the social/political aspects have just been pushed to the front.\n\nStandardized testing was the spark to a slow, arduous demise. It has deteriorated the federal and state systems to a degree that I fear has no good or plausible solution. I\u2019m not sure if there are changes which could be made to salvage the system that is in place now. \n\nThe last 5-6 graduating classes of the high school level have been shuffled out of the system with zero critical thinking skills. College (if taken seriously) can fix that flaw in our standards of teaching, but when college puts you into debt that will last most of your adult life the risk of not being able to land a job with a minimally adequate salary after you\u2019ve gotten a degree just doesn\u2019t seem worth it.\n\nAlso, you have highly educated individuals (many from Ivy League schools) telling everyone who will listen that a college education is actually a bad thing and the system is run by greedy, godless individuals. Which is not necessarily untrue, but not for the reason that are being spouted by politicians. \n\nIgnorant citizens are the easiest to control. There is a reason learning to read was an offense in the Middle Ages depending on your gender, class status, or parentage.",

I watched the moment they announced he won and watched the whole street of black families celebrating and cheering for him.  \nIn reality he didn't do much for black americans in terms of policy, he wrote personal opinions in his books that he thought the country was racist, had bitter feelings about it, and wanted retribution over helping the country.  \nI think that lead to his policies although many other liberals have defended him over the years saying he did a lot of good things, I think in retrospect he did not end up much different than the president that came before and after him in terms of policy. He just ended up holding up the status quo. I think that's tragic.",

It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a soft landing, a mild recession or a depression nor seen in a 100 years (or anything in between obviously.) \n\nAll the inflationary pressures can be traced to all those handouts. Most the housing issues can be too (plus add in Trumps tariffs (taxes) in wood,  steel and other common goods. \n\nSupply issues were haunting us even before the pandemic. We just didn\u2019t notice them as much because we weren\u2019t told to be looking at them like we are now. \n\nWe are still a net exporter of petro and natural gas. It\u2019s actually higher than when Trump was in office. (Spend five minutes away from talk radio and tv and look it up.) \n\nPeople are back to work. They need to get around. More travel more gas. More gas more demand. \n\nPeople are traveling more. See above.\n\nLast two plus months we been supplying our reserves and excess to Europe. There\u2019s a war Putin was hoping Trump was still president for. Easier to raid your neighbor when the biggest power in front of you and is on his knees.\n\nI love the border one. Spend five minutes and go on the treasury department website. It will floor you to know those classified as Hispanic legal and illegal make up 17.5% of the country and make up 17.8% of the GDP. It must eat your ass that some have found away to use a system that you yourself may be able to use to your advantage when you are just starting out or if heaven forbid life throws you on the streets. Damn socialism though makes good headlines and fear of using them. \n\nWeird to think about but the average person pays $20,000 in various taxes annually, but what do you get out of it? Think long and hard. Do you think paying less taxes you\u2019ll get a bigger share? Think about the first point I made. Keep fearing socialism though when your elected officials be been robbing you blind for your whole adult life. \n\nFor me personally i said it before and I will continue to say it those who rely on either of the government endorsed parties will never help us get out of the continual and ever increasing pace of a rule of law for the political class and a rule of law for the rest of us. We are almost there but keep up the good work repeating their talking points.",

They want to privatize public schools like they have with prisons, graduate to the penitentiary because no interest in education or reform only money.\n\nThere is nothing these people do in administration or management worth more than a teacher.

If a felon can't get a minimum wage job washing dishes, they're may feel forced back into crime to earn a living. If the state doesn't allow them to vote, they shouldn't be allowed to hold any public office. If jail & penitentiary actually reformed/educated inmates there wouldn't be any recidivism and public/private sector would have more trust, willing to hire felons, let them vote and lead.\n\nIf a felon can't pass a background check, they have no business making $150,000 being in charge of millions or influencing education and kids. Way too much temptation for abuse from someone proven untrustworthy and a lawbreaker. This also goes for any political office if they also can't pass a security clearance. Leaders should be of higher moral character, better ethics, more educated or more experienced than those they are in charge of/govern over. \n\n>(Of course they could get another job, but discriminating against past crimes isn\u2019t exactly a good look)\n\nNeither is letting criminals run the penitentiary, schools, government or putting them back into temptation. I mean if you have a felony for: molesting kids - no school/daycare or child related jobs; theft/robbery/white collar financial crimes - no handling monies; dui's - no driving jobs; beating/killing old folks - no nursing home/assisted living/hospital jobs; torturing/killing animals - no veterinary/animal shelter/training jobs. Past actions are the best predictors of future actions, sad but true fact - the proof is in high recidivism rates themselves.",

Do you think remote school is better, where each child needs their own caretaker (either hired at the parents' expense, or a parent simply stays home if they don't make significantly more than a caretaker's reasonable compensation)?\n\nChildcare is an important function and someone has to do it. In-person schooling is tons better than remote schooling for the kids, and the teacher is already there, so they provide the supervision. I would love it if teachers were paid more for the vital work they do, but that's not the issue you raised: parents get upset when they suddenly lose access to the childcare they previously had. Of course they get upset! If both parents work outside the home, they suddenly have to scramble to find childcare.",

If an administration is evil enough to paint a strike as teachers hurting students and their parents, there's not much hope for progress there anyway. Again, if working conditions were better all around, parents wouldn't have to worry about taking an occasional day off to look after their sick kid.\n\nWho should be handling childcare, if not the adults who already spend their day in a room with 20 kids?",

That's why I thought we were talking about whether it makes sense for parents to be upset that the help that they're used to getting - the help that's vital in today's society - suddenly disappears. Which is what you said, which I initially responded to. I'll quote it for you:\n\n> The general public gets pissy because their daycare is taken away. This is exactly what happened during COVID when teachers were asked to WFH.\n\nNotice that this statement doesn't include anything even remotely related to parents being the guardians of their children, and ensuring that said children have adequate supervision (and food, shelter, etc.). You just said that they get upset when they no longer have access to childcare. That is the actual topic. I now understand that you decided to change the topic and berate me for a position I never took. And you're the one accusing me of arguing for the sake of being difficult? Funny. Thanks for wasting my time, you lunatic troll.",

Drive an hour south and you'll find yourself in tge bible belt crammed full of US based evangelical churches.  \nEdmonton often gets called Redmonton for it's tendency to elect moderates.  Provincially we have only managed to elect a centrist party on one occasion, though.\n\nI guess we still have lots of similarities.",

However, many people don\u2019t spend big $ on sports - if I as a private citizen attend one NFL game this year, I\u2019m likely forking over well over a hundred dollars to the company in the form of admission, parking, concessions, etc. Even if I don\u2019t spend another dime on merchandise, a cable or streaming plan for watching it on tv (the tv deals are pretty lucrative for the league), or buying athlete-endorsed products (seeing as many athletes really bring in the big money from their likeness especially after their career is over) that\u2019s still a bunch of money going into the NFL\u2019s pocket. Roughly 13-16 stadiums a week are pulling in tens of thousands of fans who may only be spending just a little bit of money. Regardless, that\u2019s how all that money is made. \n \nFor public sector employees yeah totally either taxes need to be raised or perhaps allocated more effectively. In the private sector the enemy of underpaid employees is not Odell Beckham Jr, it\u2019s their boss\n \n(Editing my comment to add that your point about it being a social problem is entirely valid in my opinion, people are selfish and would rather spend money on something they enjoy that is a leisure activity and brings them reprieve from their careers in the form of entertainment as opposed to paying more taxes that might benefit someone else. We live in a pretty very individualistic society compared to other more well functioning republics)",

If outsourcing gets the job done for less than the cost of an employee, that is the best way. If not they will offer higher compensation until they find someone. If they have a finite budget they may have to be creative or cut other expenses to make it work.\n\nWhen working for someone other than ourselves we sell our time. We have a limited supply of hours to sell in a day, and in our lifetime. \n\nWe have the ability to spend time when we are not working to increase the value of our time by investing in ourselves. This can be through both physical and mental training. We can also accept undesired positions temporarily to gain skills and experience as a way of increasing the future value of our time.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, I currently sell my time for approximately 5.3x the rate I did 15 years ago. (Over 7x not factoring inflation)\n\nPoint being I find it helpful to view my time from the perspective of a limited supply resource that I market to others. I have a plan in progress to continue growing the value of my time another 1.5x (adjusted for inflation) the current rate before I estimate I will cap out and have to create my own business to increase the value of my time further.",

But i will always remember him as an angel. He was an uneducated, balding, middle aged man with a huge beer gut. But he was always the person I would look forward to seeing all day. Its been over a decade since the last time I saw him, but I will never forget him. \n\nA custodian at my elementary school was a legend   with the students. He was a tall guy, and would always go on the roof during recess to get all the balls that ended up on there to throw them down to the cheering crowds of children. The whole school threw him a party when he left and was brought to tears. \n\nSchool custodians will always have a very special place in my heart, you guys truly have huge hearts, and care for those kids more than most of them will ever realize.

So I totally get why that 11 dollar an hour pay might not be a huge bother to you. \n\nBut man holy fuck you're worth so much more. Bottom line is that you could walk into any job hiring for 'walk in' level positions and make way more. Could do something just a bit more specialized but still entry level and probably double what you make now. \n\nPlease for your own success look into options (find out your worth) and then fight to get what you deserve. Maybe the school would be willing to pay you more? Or maybe you can continue being a janitor or maintenance type worker somewhere that pays you 18 an hour or more? Or do something totally new. Shit delivery drivers near me are getting hired at 30 an hour lol",

If you're getting paid $11 an hour, a proper cost of living adjustment would bring you up to $12.29 an hour. \n\nNEVER let your employer refer to a cost of living adjustment as a \"raise.\" A raise is something you should ask for every few years as your experience becomes a bigger asset to the company. Also, ask for one if someone gets fired or quits and you're expected to pick up the slack. With the figures you provided, it sounds like you have been there for more than a decade.

At the end his mom and grandmother ended up bringing me gifts and I still get Christmas cards from his grandmother. His mother told me that her son's entire view of learning changed and he decided to go to community college thanks to my time with him.\n\nI don't think teachers can build a relationship to this level as they have so many students they have to handle.

They are public in the sense that anyone could possibly attend and they are tax-funded like a public school but they are private in that they are not held to the same standards that public schools are held (these standards vary by state, laws, etc...) and are not run by the state but by a group/individual.\n\nIn reality, they are privately run schools (that often have corporate backing) that use funding that could go to a public school and are VERY selective with who attends, with families being placed on waiting lists for years. Charters regularly kick out students due to poor grades or behavior and dump them into the local public school and because they don't follow state/national standards they are allowed to do it. This makes them \"look better\" on paper so they can continue to justify their existence and use of public funding. \n\nAre there good Charter Schools? Yes. But there are also many that are poorly run and there are many more that shut down after a few years.\n\nThis is a very truncated explanation and there is a ton of nuance and you can find many, many explanations that go more in-depth. You'll find the current debates under titles like \"School Choice\" or \"School Vouchers\" or things that are similarly titled but in my (and many others') opinion it's all just a way to further privatize education.\n\nEdit: I also want to clarify that I bear no ill will to any teacher that works in a Charter. They often pay more and people have to do what they need to do to provide for themselves and their families.",

To me, they were just adults telling me about stuff they just happened to know pretty well. Working in education now, I\u2019d say 75% of the teachers at my school are part of the newer generation who\u2019ve gone into it because they want to help and inspire kids (obviously not all of them are as good at that as they probably hoped they\u2019d be!). They actively work at creating positive environments and relationships, and across the board they care about the kids as individual people. I often wonder how my perspective and confidence as a kid might have been shifted with that different approach/attitude.",

One of the problems with this post is that it doesn\u2019t state the experience they have. Okay, yes, teachers should get paid more, but if they have 2 masters and no experience, then maybe they fucked up by going to school for too long without gaining experience. Get double masters and expect to get hired for big money as a teacher is not a common trend anywhere. So I hope it was just a missed detail. \n\nIndependent of the masters tho, they should still get paid more in general. In my profession, most people have degrees, some people have MBAs, some have PharmDs, some have MDs and some have phds. Those with doctor in the title are likely to be paid more, those with degrees and MBAs are a dime a dozen.",

I feel like I\u2019m setting myself up for downvotes, but spending at *least* $100k on two graduate degrees without a reasonable expectation of a financial return on them seems unwise. \n\nOf course, I do think teachers *should* be rewarded for advanced degrees more than they are (it\u2019s a few thousand a year in my mom\u2019s district) and the field should generally pay them more across the board, but still\u2026 there are a lot of programs I\u2019d enroll in and plenty of student loans available, but I don\u2019t because they\u2019d be a luxury and not something I could financially justify.",

If I say \"NFL players have a far more dangerous job than professional bowlers\", would you jump to a list of the fatality rates for those sports?  You also conveniently left out the \"much worse conditions\" comparison in your original comment, but it's fairly obvious why you did.  \n\n\n\"Police officers don't require a BA either, and their training courses are quite short, which is why they're easily comparable to pizza delivery drivers over both qualifications and on the job danger\"   \nEducations requirements vary per department. Many require at least an associate's or a bachelor's degree. You can get a pizza delivery job without a high school diploma as long as you have a valid driver's license. And the on the job training is far different, but then again, you knew that already as well.  \n\n\nHere is the original comment I replied to \"If teachers have to take second jobs to make ends meet, then that is society telling them they're not respected, and you can be damn well sure the kids know that. How can you teach children who know you're not worth respecting?\"  \n\n\nTeachers and police officers are often mentioned together as careers which are underpaid, serve the public, and are important to our society. Police officers have to take second jobs to make ends meet (actually, they do that WAY more often than teachers.) Is that not also society telling police that they're not respected.  You're asking police officers to deal with dangerous people, enforce laws, maintain order, preserve general safety and welfare all while telling them they're not worth respecting. \n\nI could tell you if you want to make angry, unfounded, ignorant replies to comments then do it in your own thread, but I'm not the reddit police which apparently is what you make yourself out to be. Is that why you are so bitter at the police? They wouldn't hire you because of all the red flags?",

You were the first one to become insulting here, bubby. Eeesh. I hope you don't treat your students like this. Also, I really hope you aren't teaching english or language arts class. It's troubling that you can't grasp that something which is referred to as dangerous doesn't automatically refer to something that always causes death. \n\nI was a school resource officer for awhile. Soooo maybe you don't know about recruitment standards, but who knows? Maybe you do (kinda doubt it though). My time in the school was when I learned about the pay discrepancy and also the working conditions. Now, DO NOT GET ME WRONG, in a good school (which I was in), my job was waaaaaay easier than it was than working the street. At times, my job was also easier than a lot of the teachers.  I didn't have a cushy schedule like they did though and all the time off they got.    \n\n\nNow that I think about it, I was often the middle-man/mediator between the administration and teachers. Everyone generally liked and trusted me. Most of the teachers would come up to me and feel free to vent their frustrations with the administration not doing their jobs right, and vice versa. Everyone knew I wasn't going to repeat what they said. As I would hear about both sides, I would often try to make the complaining party consider the opposing perspective as well. For the record, it's generally harder to have the administrator consider the opposing perspective.   \n\n\nAlso, people who know me know that it takes a whooole lot to get me angry. I stay calm and nonchalant in stressful situations. That's probably part of the reason they asked me to become a negotiator and join the team.  Nationally certified for 7 years, de-escalatin' and calming people down the whole way :)   \n\n\nEnjoy your day! Be nice to your students!",

I also just googled the salary pay scale for teachers which is publicly posted on that school district's website .  The starting hourly salary for a brand new teacher with zero experience is $29.22 per hour. \n\nI use the hourly rate because teachers typically work around 190 days per year, so their hourly rate is the more accurate information.\n\nI googled the average salaries for teachers in New Jersey.  In February of 2021, the median salary for teachers was 90k or more in 19 school districts in the state.  The state median salary was $70,815.  That's an hourly rate of $46.58 per hour.  That hourly rate over an entire year for a full time schedule is $96,886 per year .   Ideally, I would try to find pay scales for teachers and police officers in one county to provide more specific comparisons.  I don't have that time at the moment.",

In other words, the shitty system we currently have. \n\nPretending the education system is a free market is idiotic. Trust me, I used to think that way. If you're rich, this is a non-issue, because you're able and willing to pay for the best education for your kids. The big problem is not everyone is rich.\n\nQuality public education improves things for everyone. It opens up opportunities for lower income people, which allows them to make more money, and results in more tax revenue. Taxes go down for everyone. It's really not rocket science.",

Right now teaching is viewed as a fall back option by a lot of people, something you do when your other career paths didn't pan out. If you make the wage attractive enough, more people will choose teaching as their first option.\n\nThe whole raising wages argument isn't about current teachers putting in more effort, it's attracting higher quality teachers to the profession.",

But I was going to be strapped with over $50k student debt (that we know will quickly rise with interest and not enough payments to put a dent into it like it does for the average borrower) and after numerous research and networking, I found out the pay was around $30k. A masters is required. My dreams felt crushed and I dropped out of the program, with no motivation or path to go otherwise. I wanted a career to help others, but not a career that'll hold myself back. I want vacations, healthcare, retirement, the ability to afford travel in my lifetime. That potential future was far from it. I had to let it go.\n\nI dropped out with $20k in student debt. It still sucks, but it's better than the latter.",

An uneducated/under-educated electorate favors them.\n\nIn fact, that whole *bOtH pArTiEs ArE tHe SaMe!* mentality is a consequence of poor mental discipline (due in no small part to a subpar/under-stimulating education), plus digital information overload, not being able to distinguish maliciously divisive propaganda targeted straight at them.\n\nFor one side, republicans serve a *\"libruls hate you, they hate America and they hate God!\"* propaganda platter, for the other side they serve the *\"bOtH pArTiEs ArE tHe SaMe!\"* variety.\n\nBoth of these propaganda narratives gained traction for their respective targets and a life of their on.

Most restaurants expect you to make 100% of your income via tips *before tip-out* (tip-out is what servers pay to bussers, bartenders, etc. based on sales, not actual tips received.  If a $200 table tips $0, you still probably owe $10-15 to support staff out of your own pocket).  In other words, you might also be making 100% of your income based on tips, but you realistically have also never received a portion of that money due to tip-outs.\n\nAlso, not making 100% of your income from tips is one of the fastest ways to get fired, as restaurants do not want to pay a single dollar - even $2/hr - to pay serving staff.",

The base salary of an engineer is about 80k/year so I think that's totally fair for educators because it would most likely be the maximum to still keep their elderly financial security.",

The big one was my health insurance premiums which was maybe $200 or $300. If I were to calculate pre-benefits, my hourly would probably come out to under $10, under the threshold of what's expected for a teacher, but passing if calculated on a 40 hour work week. The catch for teachers is that, at least for my schools, there was no such thing as only a 40 hour work week. Many people don't realize that there is office time, preparations, cleanup, tons of administration, dealing with social issues (parents and families), and in my case, commuting to multiple schools on a regular, if not daily basis. \n\nI was usually at my desk by 8am, and usually not home until past 10pm. And usually there are some events on the weekends which require me. \n\nAnd no, I did not get summers off. After a few years, even though I enjoyed teaching in many ways and loved the students, I had to pursue a career change. If I didn't, I would never be able to meet many financial goals.",

Frankly I don't think that warrants even a 4-year degree, and it didn't use to.\n\nAcademia has become a runaway train swallowing up alarming amounts of money and giving us lower-quality college education than in the past. The whole system needs to collapse.",

Additionally because of the summer break, I really see no reason that teachers shouldn't be paid a wage that covers the entire year so they don't have to get a summer job to make ends meet (although no reason they can't do so anyway). All that said, the real problem here is that academia forces teachers to run through its pointless grist mill and rack up substantial debt. And because tuition has skyrocketed over the last 30-40 years, the typical debt load for a rookie teacher has only gotten worse.\n\nI really think it's long past time we switched to a certification system for teachers, where they have to take general knowledge tests in whatever subjects they'll teach and also do some training on managing classrooms: conflict resolution, discipline situations, curriculum development and management, how to create and administer tests, etc. That's all our teachers really need below the college level. Knowledge of the subject is all most teachers need *at* the college level. None of this should require a master's degree or PhD, or even a 4-year degree.",

If the market is saturated with teachers it is quite obvious that they will start needing masters and eventually lower the pay. I just did a quick recount in my head and I have 4 teachers in my husband's side of the family and 3 near friends that are teachers. They are doing what they love. We all live in Norway where jobs pay well enough anyway.\n\nMy family, who is in Brazil, has no teachers. But we have 5 lawyers, a dentist, 3 nurses, 2 engineers and 2 bank workers/economists. (And myself, a doctor) All professions that pay well. Because my family is of dirt poor origin and evaluated what the market needed before getting an education. We didn't want to continue living in poverty. We learned to love our professions. Or, in my brother's case, he hated being a dentist and went back to school to become a lawyer. It is possible to merge your passion with what is financially profitable. \n\nAnd that is why Brazil has a higher amount of women in the STEM fields than Norway, despite not being even remotely as socially progressive as Norway.",

I find it incredible, and disrespectful, to that you say that you get paid \u201clittle\u201d.\n\nIf you want to get serious we can, in fact teachers in the United States are oftentimes in marriages that put them vastly above the income to raise families. They oftentimes give their children better education and lives than most Americans. They have more opportunities to travel, and do, than most of the United States. The teachers I know love their job and purpose even when it sucks.(however, most people I know love their jobs so that might be a you problem)\n\nYou want me to think that my family who are teachers have a worse life than my family who are doctors and don\u2019t travel? Or my family that makes $25k and barely makes by? No, you don\u2019t know. You read post on Reddit and other social media and think that it\u2019s true that teachers are poor. If you think teachers are poor, woooooof, imagine the majority of the US.\n\nI want teachers to get paid more so they can do even more, but I can\u2019t sit here and listen to people say that teachers are \u201cpoor\u201d.\n\nGoogle anything I typed, I don\u2019t have time to link them sorry",

Bankers?\n\nYou don\u2019t study something as hard in school, or are you saying you do? I don\u2019t know why you want to be paid $80k or $100k off the bat just to do 8-9 months worth of work. It\u2019s ridiculous. You should be paid more with inflation now but it\u2019s insane to act like teachers are poor",

However don\u2019t say teachers are poor, they aren\u2019t. If you think they are poor, you\u2019d be shocked at the majority of the US or world.\n\nAnd I did teach.

When people discuss teachers salaries, they never take the extra step of remembering that they are only being paid for 180 days of work. Not the 250 that everyone else works. So when you see a salary it's divided differently then 52 weeks everyone else gets.\n\nI know nurses who don't make 42$ an hour, and deal with more stress, and that takes just as much education. And they don't get summers off. Teachers have a work more problem, not a pay more problem. 42 would put them in the high 80k range for a normal working year.\n\n60k isn't the standard, will be your counter argument, and mine will be cost of living in the area could change the salary as well. We don't have all the information. I'm all for teachers making more, but just remember it's off of 180 days, before we get shocked about how low it is.",

      "text": "So, I agree. Teachers do not make enough for the hell they go through. But, at this point, teachers aside, everyone is demanding higher pay. This also makes the cost of living skyrocket even faster. Yes, the cost of living has gone up anyway, but it\u2019s the circle of work. You own a company, you have to pay your employees, but if they demand higher pay, you have to raise your prices. Thus, spending $100 at Walmart (i say this loosely) amounts to what $50 used to buy.\n\nThere are jobs that aren\u2019t meant to be careers, and i understand that some people have these jobs as careers, but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re meant for.\n\nExample: I am 21 years old, and worked in a locally owned convenience store for about 2 years before I moved into my career field, and they started at $9.50/hr. That job was to get my foot in the door in the workforce (legally speaking, I was homeless from 15-17, then had back surgery right after I turned 17, so I didn\u2019t end up getting my driver\u2019s license till 18), not so I could move out and try to start making a living. When I worked at the convenience store, we had some of the best prices on things in town, because we marked the % low. When everyone was demanding higher pay, the boss couldn\u2019t afford to give everyone a raise, so they had to increase their prices, and not to mention the fact that vendors went up slowly in prices too. With that, we lost so many customers. Now, the store starts their employees at around $10.50, for being a cashier, stocking, and making snow cones.\n\nThe point is, the focuses are on the wrong things. $10/hr working at McDonald\u2019s, as a cashier, etc. Should be acceptable but it\u2019s not. Working for $16.25 as a TEACHER? Why is that more acceptable? These teachers shape our children\u2019s futures. These teachers have to deal with your spoiled, disrespectful kids just about everyday during the school year. *that* is unacceptable.",

I can't remember how many personal leave days they get, but it's not a whole lot. I'm from the Joliet area originally, btw.    \n\n\nThe teachers that I'm familiar with are required to be there 7.5 hours per day. There are 6 periods in the school day, and they only teach during 4 of those periods. The other 2 periods are for doing their other work, training, meetings, etc.   \n\n\nBy far, the worst thing about their job nowadays is the parents. The absolute lengths they will go to in defending their kids (even after the kid does the same thing over, and over, and over, and over, and over again) has to be maddening.  The kids can be a handful too.  And with social media/internet/technology, they keep the drama, bullying, anxiety, etc. with them 24/7. When I was a kid, if I had a shit day because of other kids at school, at least I could avoid it when I got home.   \n\n\nTeachers don't have an easy job by any means, but their compensation can be better than what people realize. Oh....and if you still live in Illinois, I'd spend a good number of your years up there building income and then move to the Carolinas as you get older. The weather is beautiful down here, the people are really nice, you can be close to the mountains and the ocean, and more.  The only thing you'll miss is the food. And your retirement money will go a lottttt further down here than it goes up there. If I worked in Illinois, I'd be worried about my pension being stable and fully funded when I retire.",

Assuming the Teachers has a Associate's or Bachelor's degree. \n\n\nNow with these budget cuts and lack of Government and State funding I knew and heard teachers weren't being as paid as much as they used to for public schools.. but THIS?! Especially since the Teacher has a Master's degree (which IMHO possibly over qualified) This is a slap to every teachers face.\n\nIf this is the price for a teacher teaching at a Private school.. we are in MUCH MUCH WORSE SHAPE.",

The bartender salary might be half of what the teacher\u2019s is and with almost certainly no benefits like medical or 401k. whereas the teacher may pay little to nothing for medical coverage and have a pension lined up or some fairly decent retirement.

After taxes, I brought home closer to 32k. I made 2800 a month. \n\nThat enough for a single person in Chicago, but it's hard to find anything but a studio for 1000 a month, and pretty impossible to support more than one person. Of course I would have made more over time. I also spent about $300 of my own money every month on supplies, and worked 50-60 hour weeks. \n\nIn rural Illinois $2800 a month would be more than enough to live in. You could rent a two bedroom apartment or buy a small house. Of course in rural Illinois teachers didn't start at 47k, they started at 23k. \n\nSo, for someone who got two masters degrees, it's a pretty low salary. Of course, I don't know why someone would get two masters degrees, and what schools pay is public record so no teacher should take on debt for a degree and be shocked at the pay. I knew exactly what I would be paid before I declared a major in education, and made sure my debt was low enough to make sense with the pay I'd get.",

But the politicians can only increase taxes so much before people just say fuck it and leave the state, which they have been doing since 2012. Illinois has negative to flat population growth since then.  This isn\u2019t some right wing talking point, this is pretty well understood in Illinois.  So, to answer your question: I think teachers deserve to retire just like anyone else. Minimum Social security retirement age is 62. Same with Medicare. No one should be retiring at 50 with full pension benefits funded by their neighbors, the taxpayers.",

She also has to buy upplies for her class.\n\nHer sister, my wife, works part time and make more than her. She also only need a 3 month course to get her job and it only cost her around 10k for that course, license etc. Her only work expenses other than gas and the like is $200 a year for license renewal. Also no risk of a child going nuts and attacking you. \n\n\nAs an apprentice with no prior training I got paid more than her and did less work. Also I was essentially paid to go to school while being an apprentice. I was paid and learned my job and got licensed while working at no expense to me. \n\nTeachers are a crucial job yet let's be real for the pay it's shit work.

Other professions you make a physicsl product. Farmers make food to sell. Facebook makes software that runs ads. McDonald's makes meals that sell. Teachers teach student. Schools are \"selling\" education but since it isn't a product then it is harder to charge a high price. You can see this by looking at professors in college. Those who where professors and did research where paid much more then those who didn't do research when allot of the time those who just taught where much better then those who did research.\n\nThe other sad truth is that because public schools are free, there isn't much money going into them to pay teachers. Everyone wants teachers to be paid more but no one whats to pay the taxes that pay teachers. This makes private schools have a lower tuition otherwise parents will just put their children is the free public school.\n\nAll in all, I think highschools should give teachers less classes and have then do research or something else that will help the schools make more profits. Then again I also think we should bring back the apprenticeship for higher education. 90% of what I learned in college I dont use and the 1 topic we spent half a semester learning about, I use for my job all day every day.",

My agency recently upped the base rate of everyone to $15 from $11 and then recently added a percentage standard of living wage increase. Then they started to match what the HERO pay was doing so we wouldn't miss it. So I make a base of $15.50 with Medicaid paying me an additional $2.35 for hours I bill for, but the agency pays me that additional $2.35 an hour for my non-billable hours in my timesheet. They do this for everyone who bills H2015/2014 codes. So I effectively now make $17.85/hour when I started this year making only $13.79. I'm not a DSP in residential settings anymore; I have a case load of people I help in the community and work from home when not visiting clients.",

A good amount of people have been in positions such as. Therefore paying for understanding. If the people had the way to increase the amount of teachers get paid, I feel like it would be in the $100k. Especially when they have to pay out of their own pocket to provide the experience of their own classroom if they want to put their special touch on it. It\u2019s really wild to me. The people in charge of paying the teachers haven\u2019t probably worked a hard long labour filled day in a super long time. They definitely haven\u2019t had to spend a lot of time with a whole classroom of kids to understand what teachers do & go through for the future generations. They don\u2019t care. The people on top see only glorified babysitters & stupid end of the year exams they need to have specific grades on\u2026 to get more money to not provide for the teachers. It\u2019s super sad but I hope that something is or will be done ab it in the soon future.",

Becoming a teacher here is highly regarded and very competitive. \n\nThe best of the best can only apply for the yearly test after you graduate college. Even if you get 100% on that test teaching exam- you are not guaranteed a teaching position. I know many that had to study again and retake it the next year.\n\nIf you get in- you are set for life. Benefits are better than businesses. \n\nExample - Get pregnant and have a kid- 2 years off for each kid and can come back as if you never left. \n\nPension, days off, many weeks of vacation and the school budget are all equal for all the schools. So no one school is \u201cbetter\u201d richer than another. They update and keep schools clean.\n\n\nAlso all schools are open enrollment so anyone can go to any public school. No rich or poor areas. The schools bus the kids all over town to get to and from school each day. This alone make teaching so much easier.\n\nI am a uni prof (14 years) and wont ever think about taking a teaching position in the states. Pay is crap, workload is insane many leave quickly and go into their respective industries making 2-3 times the pay starting.",

(1 day each week, I had to be cafeteria monitor so ate my lunch while roaming and monitoring). So 7.5 hour days x 5 is already 37.5 hours. Each day I had to have 3 different classes (intro to chem, chem, advanced chem) prepped for 45 minute classes. Full PowerPoint slides and worksheets/labs/activities. All of those materials had to be made after 4:15pm (and after 5:15pm the 2 days each week we had required tutoring hours after school to help students). Then, I had to grade at least 3 assignments per student each week (so 3x 150 = 450) to make sure they were available in the online portal for parents and students to monitor progress by every Friday. Then responding after hours to parent emails and concerns. \n\nI made $55,700 but August - early June I worked 80 hours+ each week. So mid-August to June 1 accounting for Christmas and spring breaks, we will call 36 weeks. (9 months). And I\u2019ll assume I\u2019m overestimating 80 hour weeks\u2026 let\u2019s say 70 (37.5 in classroom and about equal to grade and prepare at home). Thats 2520 hours and about $19-$22 an hour depending on 70-80 hours. In just 9 months. Almost 500 more hours than a 9-5 year round, assuming the 9-5 never leaves the office early and never takes vacation. Teachers *are* underpaid, objectively. And I usually had 5 paid sick days a year, but you feel guilty taking them since often subs are short supply and other teachers end up using their prep periods or lunches to cover your classes. In the state I was in, with no union, benefits also weren\u2019t good. Paid several hundred dollars a month for health insurance for a solo mid-late 20s guy. \n\nNot to mention, having a good teacher has been demonstrated to marginally impact the future of students\u2019 lifetime earnings\u2026 even if they don\u2019t study chemistry or go to college, learning critical thinking skills, group project dynamics and teams, problem solving, and how to take feedback are all life skills imparted by the teachers who do put that extra effort into designing thoughtful lessons. Teaching has very different expectations than 20 years ago, even. \n\nAnd in the summers I did a few weeks of training and AP Chemistry institutes, which were admittedly a choice but did make me a better teacher for my students.\n\nSo yeah, you could say quit or work for a different school with better hours/lower expectations. But truly, designing good lessons, grading promptly for feedback, offering tutoring, corresponding with parents are all best practices. If all the teachers left for lower expectation jobs, who is left and what quality education would kids get? Not sure the best solution is \u201chave teachers not work as hard at teaching kids\u201d. Just pay them like 70-80k with room to make $100-$110k with good accountability/performance (not just test scores but student and parent surveys, principal evaluations, etc).",

I did so well with one student that despite not having finished all my education requirements, they were offering me a job. I was super stoked and excited that I had got my foot in the door.\n\nMy mom, a life time math teacher (same subject I tutored and would have been teaching) sat me down to talk to me about teaching as a job. She told me she was more than happy to help me in the career, but she felt that she needed to warn me about the treatment she was seeing of younger teachers. She told me I would be extremely underpaid, would have to deal with lots of angry parents, and the administration would happily throw me under the bus to protect themselves. So I figured I would compare my earnings as a tutor and a substitute to that of a teacher. Sure the potential benefits were huge for a teacher, but I was making 10k more a year as a tutor. I was also purposely under charging in my tutoring to help a few low income students and could potentially be making significantly more. So I contacted the school and offered to do a long term sub while they found a different teacher. They were disappointed but understanding as I still needed some more education.",

The minimum wage one meant I had to find shit housing in a house share across the country, 150 miles away.  I took the latter.  It was three times less pay but I knew it was a better job and a life skill for me to learn.  It was better and after a year I moved on and doubled my salary.  It still wasn't at the salary of the first job that I turned down.  I stayed 2 years and my salary went way up.  Still shit.  I left, moved jobs.  Got a massive payrise by pretending I could do shit I couldn't and ultimately feel I am almost paid a good salary.  It shouldn't be this hard. That other job would have been the final salary, I took the other and it turned out great,  the experience was key.   I still earn shit money compared to Americans but it is enough for me.",

Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise. \n\n>The person making a negative claim cannot logically prove nonexistence. And here's why: to know that a X does not exist would require a perfect knowledge of all things (omniscience). To attain this knowledge would require simultaneous access to all parts of the world and beyond (omnipresence). Therefore, to be certain of  the claim that X does not exist one would have to possess abilities that are non-existent. Obviously, mankind's limited nature precludes these special abilities. The claim that X does not exist is therefore unjustifiable. As logician Mortimer Adler has pointed out, the attempt to prove a universal negative is a self- defeating proposition.  These claims are \"worldwide existential negatives.\" They are only a small class of all possible negatives. They cannot be established by direct observation because no single human observer can cover the whole earth at one time in order to declare by personal authority that any \u201cX\u201d doesn't exist.",

Pay is based on needs and the world is starting to figure out that public school teachers aren\u2019t needed because the public school system sucks. Also let\u2019s not forget that OT doesn\u2019t really exist if you\u2019re on salary because you just do your job OT only applies if you\u2019re hourly because your pay will increase during that period. If you don\u2019t like doing work outside of school hours do it during, make the grading and planning easier for yourself because I know many teachers who started that and loved their jobs. And good for your husband because it sounds like unless you like to live lavishly then your pay is more for a rainy day fund like my wife\u2019s is so enjoy that or just go get a new job that pays more because I\u2019m assuming if you\u2019re a HS or middle school teacher you had to major in something that pertains to what you teach in college then for your license to teach that so go find a new job if you\u2019re going to continue to bitch",

You probably do not get retirement as a bartender, health insurance or paid vacations as you would a teacher. In some small towns schools 32,800 used to be a lot and they probably have not updated wages in 15 years. For the degree choices, move to a high paying school district. Many schools pay more but you have to be willing to move. Also the higher degree you have only helps you ate later in your career. Many higher paying jobs require those better degrees but you cant apply to those just starting out either so you have to work your way up.",

By the time i graduated i had been promoted to a department manager position and was already making more money than some of the teachers at my school. I saved up, helped my mom with her rent until i turned 18. Got my first apartment and continued to work/get raises. In this time i started seeing a trend of people my age complaining about crippling student loans, not having any luck actually getting jobs with their shiny new degrees, moving back in with their parents in their mid 20s so they can save up and get their first place. By the time i turned 21 i bought my first house, fixed it up, sold it 4 years later and bought a small farm with the money. Im now making crazy money compared to (some of) the teachers here and all i do is make salads and cut watermelon all day while watching youtube. Its truly sad how little teachers get paid, if they made a decent wage, i wouldve been motivated to go to college, focus on a degree and become that english teacher i wanted to be. Now ive only got $71,000 left on my mortgage and ill be debt free soon enough. I cant imagine tacking on an additional $40,000 in student loan debt and trying to pay it all off on a teachers salary.",

So many quit Walgreens/CVS over the past two years because of working conditions. Despite bonuses they aren't being paid nearly enough for all of the work they're asked to do. \n\nSo that's why a lot of older pharmacists are going to specialty and hospital pharmacies. Meanwhile newly graduated pharmacists are trying to find good jobs but are getting lowball offers from retail pharmacies.\n\nIf your local pharmacy is insanely backed up this is probably why. If they aren't open normal hours anymore this is definitely why. Pharmacists aren't being paid what they deserve, like teachers in this situation.",

That's my 2cents, YMMV.",

That\u2019s what happens when as a society we do not value teachers enough. \n\nIf anything, public school teacher should be a sought-after federal job, with base salaries subsidized by the federal government, and states picking up the slack according to local cost-of-living expense.   A public school teacher should require high standards, getting the best education themselves, and then be one of the higher paying jobs in the country.  They should not earn less than one can make flipping burgers.",
