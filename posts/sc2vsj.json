Even if most churches around you have professional grade, it doesn't mean other areas are the same. \n\nIt also might not be for the main church room. Could be one of those little side rooms they use for community whatsits and AA meetings. Upgrading from a CRT TV on a rolly cart to a projector and a surround system, or to a lcd and a surround system. \n\nAnyway, there are plenty uses for a speaker system in a church and also plenty of almost-uses. Like, maybe the priest only needed a soundbar or a stereo speaker kit, but got the home surround system because it's \"better\" any why not?",

Both so the state cant cause undue influence on the church, and so the church cannot (overtly) influence the state. I would be worried that if you started taxing the church would:\n\n1) Move money out of communities they serve (i know you guys think that all religious are lizard people, but for the sake of the discussion) and into Panama papers-esque accounts.\n\n2) Lobby the government to subsidize the building of new churches in underserved communities, in replacement of proper civil service/welfare programs. If we take money in taxes, they would then be a rightful beneficiary of those taxes. Currently, they are not and local gov by and large does not fund religious ventures.\n\n3) Non-profits. The day that this law is passed, someone will sue the government for discrimination based on the concept that the government can't arbitrarily pick and choose which org to tax and which to not. They would then have to tax ALL non-profits or none at all. There is court precedent for this already: Rosenberger v UVA.\n\n4) This is an extension on 1. Large churches would do as described and minimize and likely eliminate their tax burden, while small churches, that tend to more often actually help their communities, would go under, leaving ONLY the megachurches. This is an incentive TO THEM, push people out their community church and into the megachurch.\n\n5) They would have to audit their accounting, which would logically involve the government\u00a0defining what is and is not legitimate and then act to ensure compliance. This\u00a0raises a constitutional issue as Congress cannot make laws that affect the free exercise of religion. And you dont want them to. Let's not throw our constitutional rights to the wind because we're spiteful towards religious people. \n\nTaxation of churches would create an unconstitutional financial entanglement between churches and the government, and separation of church and state mandates financial separation as well as institutional separation.

Actual charities have to account for how they spend their money to keep tax free status, churches do not.  Much of what the church spends money on would not be tax free by the rules that non church tax exempt orgs have to follow.  All anyone is asking is remove very special treatment that only churches get and make them exactly on par with non-religious tax exempt orgs.  The extra taxes from the churches would go to pay for government to do what it should do and get religion out.  \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/21/rutan-ram-tennessee-foster-adoption-lawsuit-jewish/",

Saying that the separation of church and state necessitates exemption from taxes just doesn\u2019t seem like a salient point to me, it seems more like preferential (not separated) treatment to prop them up, especially since some of them essentially operate as businesses. We see churches and religious leaders toe the line on endorsements all of the time, and it\u2019d be naive to think that they don\u2019t hold sway over their congregants views. \n\nAnd that\u2019s not evil, hypocritical or wrong. NPOs do the same thing, maintaining investments and whatnot. I just have a hard time understanding how tax-exempt status is reigning them in effectively, not that I think some of them won\u2019t become even more political if they lose it.

But I *absolutely will not relent* on churches paying property taxes!! Churches benefit from the tax payer funded amenities like roads, water and sewage systems, police, fire and medical services, and should help pay for them. \n\nDo some research into the amount of property owned just by The Church of Scientology. It's disgustingly huge, and they pay ZERO PROPERTY TAXES ON IT!! Then there are the \"mega churches\". Joel Osteen's church used to be a sports stadium. The church also owns the mansion he lives in, his cars, and everything else he enjoys. You see, there's a cap on the salary preachers can earn, but NOT on their housing and living allowance. Preachers are living large in huge mansions, flying in private jets, riding in limousines, ALL TAX FREE!!\n\n*TAX THE DAMNED CHURCHES!!!*",

Everyone in the USA has the right to believe and worship as they choose, and those organizations can call themselves whatever they want.  The fact that churches (the largest ones, and all of them as a whole) have large income that are *not* being used for their designated charitable intent makes them essentially businesses. \n\nAs I've said before, using slightly modified business tax laws, churches could still pay little to no taxes, provided they use their money to help those in need. That would make them far more \"moral\" than they are currently are. \n\nThe one thing I'm \"set in stone\" about is churches paying property taxes. We lived in a small town (9 square miles, about 3 miles by 3 miles) that had at least 12 churches. My husband and I were involved in city government (unpaid city council and other board positions) and worked very hard to build a cohesive community with those churches, trying to get them involved with city events, which would have given them visibility, recognition, and the gratitude of the entire city. Not only did they refuse, but they copied what the park board was doing-- and they did it illegally.  Very few of the city's citizens attended those churches. Most congregants came from outside our city limits, so our citizens were paying for their wear and tear on the infrastructure.  That's why I'll always demand churches *at least* pay property taxes. It's the least they can do.",

Any former altar boys wanting to sue will only get what the abuser owns, which is not much.

Some of the great scientific thinkers of all time were Christian.\n\n>They lobby to ban abortions.\n\nGood\n\n>They force their beliefs and values onto others. Many are discriminatory.

Then there is scientology that is pseudo-scientific. But overall, the basic belief of religion is contrary to science. There is no science but faith. And faith often requires holding beliefs that are contrary to science. The religious know better than to claim being anti-science but many of their beliefs do not hold up to science. Some even resort to pseudo-science to justify those beliefs. The requiring of faith instead of empirical evidrnce is for me unacceptable. This, I deem to be anti-scientific.\n\nI know it is fascist and contrary to my  principles to ban religion but I am so disgusted by religion that not only would I not mind if it were to be banned but I would probably laugh when they get a taste of their own medicine. I am all for freedom and choice but in this matter, my hypocrissy matches merely theirs. I would however fight for their right to freedom of belief if they would learn to respect the rights of others and keep their religions personal instead of trying to shove it down everyone elses throats as well as not discriminate against those with different beliefs or values.",

Meaning Joel Olsteen has to pay taxes on his salary and book sales. And if he doesn\u2019t then it\u2019s because he\u2019s using the tricks secular rich people use. \n\nIf you take away tax exemption then they\u2019ll be taxed like other corporations. Corporations don\u2019t pay tax on revenue, they pay taxes on profit. Amazon reinvests so they don\u2019t pay taxes. Big Churches would simply fo the same. \n\nMy concern with this is how it impacts nonprofits who are doing good things. Religious or not. I know an elderly couple who have been taking care of homeless people for 45 years. They basically have nothing. I don\u2019t agree with their religion, but I can also see the homeless people, especially the mentally Ill they\u2019ve helped. If you taxed them on revenue then you\u2019d be taking food out of homeless peoples mouths. If on \u201cprofit\u201d than it wouldn\u2019t hurt them. \n\nRegardless, taxing this unsophisticated, yet humanitarian church doesn\u2019t hurt Joel Osteen. 1% find loopholes. \n\nSomething structured like a death tax where you only tax assets above a certain level would be interesting. And stiff penalties for abuse.\n\nTo find 75B the government can reduce military spending by ~7%. \n\nI\u2019m going to get downvoted again. But it\u2019s empathy coupled with reason that gets people out of the religious trap. Not antagonizing  them with shit that won\u2019t even work and will be wasted by our government anyway.",

Churches are tax exempt in the USA because we (supposedly) have separation of church and state, and churches aren't supposed to have any say in our government. Now, we all know that they DO have some say in our government, but that's what we REALLY need to be fighting against. By taxing them, we would be dismantling the separation of church and state for them. The moment they start paying taxes, they have every right to demand a seat at the decision making table. We're better off trying to push evangelicals back into the marginalized position they held before the Cold War. Yes, taxing the hell out of Joel Osteen would be incredibly satisfying, but instead of inviting him to the table I'd rather tell him to keep his money and kick him out of the hall completely.",

      "text": "Jesus on Paying Taxes:\r  \n\r  \n**Matt 22: 15-22**\r  \n\r  \n15 Then the Pharisees went out and conspired to trap Jesus in His words. 16 They sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians. \u201cTeacher,\u201d they said, \u201cwe know that You are honest and that You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You seek favor from no one, because You pay no attention to external appearance. 17 So tell us what You think: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n18 But Jesus knew their evil intent and said, \u201cYou hypocrites, why are you testing Me? 19 Show Me the coin used for the tax.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd they brought Him a denarius.\r  \n\r  \n20 \u201cWhose image is this,\u201d He asked, \u201cand whose inscription?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n21 \u201cCaesar\u2019s,\u201d they answered.\r  \n\r  \nSo Jesus told them, \u201cGive to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s, and to God what is God\u2019s.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n22 And when they heard this, they were amazed. So they left Him and went away.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n**Mark 12: 13-17**\r  \n\r  \n13 Later, they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to catch Jesus in His words. 14 \u201cTeacher,\u201d they said, \u201cwe know that You are honest and seek favor from no one. Indeed, You are impartial and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or not?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n15 But Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said, \u201cWhy are you testing Me? Bring Me a denarius to inspect.\u201d 16 So they brought it, and He asked them, \u201cWhose image is this? And whose inscription?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCaesar\u2019s,\u201d they answered.\r  \n\r  \n17 Then Jesus told them, \u201cGive to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s, and to God what is God\u2019s.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nAnd they marveled at Him.\r  \n\r  \n\n\n**Luke 20: 19-26**\n\n\r  \n19 When the scribes and chief priests realized that Jesus had spoken this parable against them, they sought to arrest Him that very hour. But they were afraid of the people.\r  \n\r  \n20 So they watched Him closely and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They were hoping to catch Him in His words in order to hand Him over to the rule and authority of the governor. 21 \u201cTeacher,\u201d they inquired, \u201cwe know that You speak and teach correctly. You show no partiality, but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. 22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n23 But Jesus saw through their duplicity and said to them, 24 \u201cShow Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n\u201cCaesar\u2019s,\u201d they answered.\r  \n\r  \n25 So Jesus told them, \u201cGive to Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s, and to God what is God\u2019s.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n26 And they were unable to trap Him in His words before the people; and amazed at His answer, they fell silent.\r  \n\n\nWell Jesus' opinion on paying taxes is in the holy book 3 times, and came right out of Jesus' mouth so I'm sure there won't be any argument against churches paying taxes. Unless, of course those in the business of preaching are actually con artists. Then we would expect that they would come up with various alternative interpretations that would benefit themselves financially instead of doing what Jesus said. Hmmm. I wonder what will happen. /s",
