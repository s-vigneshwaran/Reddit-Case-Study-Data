Not to mention how much we change it. It has an extraordinary amount of slangs. \n\nI say I love this culture while being a man that lives in it, but trust me, my mind is not limited to it. I've seen many other cultures. Brazil is simply the most interesting.\n\nI assume you already know about the crime statistics. It seems everyone gets robbed at least once living here. But in rich neighbourhoods, you can even walk out at night. Just don't get involved with the wrong people. Never look like you're lost and never look like a foreigner. People will try to take advantage of you. \n\nWhere I live, some people have no respect for each other. Most of my neighbors make noise and don't care about others. However it's a poor city. The third-world parts of the country are not pleasing. There's always idiots who remove the muffler in their bikes. \n\nBut it's completely worth to meet the respectful part of it.

It's not just about the money you see on paper, that's just the country's white money. India has a fuck ton of black money, and it really becomes clear why when you have to get anything even mildly legal/government related. There's always a guy who'll charge you an absurd amount for anything you need, but he'll get it done most of the time.\n\n2. Know how to talk to people. If you wanna reside long term in India, you've gotta gauge the nature of the person you're talking to, especially if you're a foreigner, cuz you'll get scammed a bunch of times before you can have an understanding of the culture and society. You'll have to bribe your way out of most situations if you want a hassle free life.\n\n3. Are either heartless or just don't give a fuck. The political and social atmosphere is sometimes very depressing. \n\nThese 3 things and some time and experience are probably enough to get anyone started. You'll learn asking the way as you talk to people. It gets harder it you wanna avoid that, but as a socially retarded individual myself, I can say that you can get a lot of help from the internet and avoid talking to people.\n\nI'd also like to mention that your life probably won't be very enjoyable if you're not checking any of these boxes, but that might be a stretch idk I'm high.",

Criminal organisations from, or just begging organisations, usually, the east move poor people to the west and have them beg then pocket the cash themselves. If you go to Sweden for example you'll quickly notice that the beggars are never swedish people. There's the occasional junkie asking for cash for their next fix but the people you see sitting around begging all day are doing it as a profession. The last five years roughly 700 million norweigan crowns, somewhere around 70 million USD, went to Romania through begging scammers. Its a huge industry.",

They won't do degen sex shit for you. \n\n>You get the best food ever\n\nYou'll need a private chef who is trained to sterilize all food properly, or else you'll get tagged no matter what because the food sanitation standards throughout the whole supply chain in india is really bad. Most indians just build up an immunity to it.

It made me realize why the Brits wanted to rape that land for its spices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: General rule, stick to eating at places you see foreigners and avoid having ice in any of your drinks.
