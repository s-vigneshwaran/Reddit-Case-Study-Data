Are you aware of how it feels to be someone with FAS who knows that so many people look at them and think \"that person is probably a bad person\"?  Do you think that makes that person feel accepted by society or like an outsider?  Are people who feel like outsiders more or less invested in the welfare of society in general?  Are people who are less invested in the welfare of society more or less likely to engage in antisocial behaviors?",
