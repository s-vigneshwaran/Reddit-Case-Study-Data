  "text": "TIFU by gag gifting my daughter\nFound out today this humorous chain of events - well humorous depending on where you are in the chain.\n\nI saw a month or so ago that someone bought a box of ferrero rocher chocolate and wrapped Brussel sprouts in the wrappers so I did this to my daughter. I unwrapped each piece and carefully wrapped a Brussel sprout in each wrapper and returned it to the box. Then I sent the gift and waited.\n\nChristmas morning we talked and she thanked me for the candy. I asked her if she enjoyed them and she said yes - I knew she hadn't opened the gift yet, but why lie? I then realized that she probably re-gifted them. Then I asked again and she admitted that she had too much candy and wanted to get rid of some of it and her boss loves ferrero rocher. So I told her what I did.\n\nShe was amused but mad - mad at herself for regifting something I gave her as we are always doing stuff like that. It gets better.\n\nShe called her boss on Christmas day to tell her and her boss was like, \"Oh shit!\" She had re-gifted them to a client she was trying to keep after they'd had a heated exchange. The client is overweight and by the time my daughter's boss was able to call her it was too late. She wouldn't come to the phone. She was convinced that the wrapped vegetables was a slight and a message.\n\nAs far as I know she lost the client but isn't mad at my daughter.\n\nEDIT: Glad this post amused so many people. Here are a few notes addressing the comments.\n\n* It wasn't a giant box of candy, it was a 5 piece box. \n* I ate the candy as I wrapped the sprouts. No chocolate was harmed as a result of this prank.\n* The candy was one of many gifts and stocking stuffers we brought over. It wasn't like a $200 box of chocolate was re-gifted. \n* I wrapped the sprouts on the 23rd and gave them to my daughter that afternoon. She took them as an afterthought to a party at her boss' house to add to a gift box she gave  to her boss.\n* Her boss dropped them at the clients house on the 24th. \n* My family all agreed a few years ago to stop giving each other candy at holidays as we are all always trying to lose weight. \n* My opinion on regifting. It's actually a great thing if thought is applied. When it comes to gift giving I believe that it is the thought that counts. If I give a gift you can appreciate the thought and still share the gift with someone else. Whatever. To each is own. Thanks everyone :)\n\nTL;DR I gave a gag gift that was re-gifted until it ruined someone's Christmas.",

New waitresses always fall for it.  \n\nThe other good one is mayonnaise topped with melted sugar as \"creme brulee\".  \n\n\nOh another is make a cheesy bechamel (milk gravy) and set it in the fridge, top with berry compote (jam/jelly) and say it's a Panna Cotta.  \n\nYou can also make \"chocolate mousse\" from eggs whites and gravy browning.  \n\nI like those sorts of pranks because they're hilarious but harmless- it's all food, just not the food you were expecting so there's a moment of delightful confusion before they spit it out.",

(duh...)\n\nBut seriously, you can probably do most of those while avoiding using new allergens. For example interchanging cream/butter/whipped cream/milk should provide plenty of prank foods all by itself.\n\nOr in the mayonnaise example the mayonnaise can replace the Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9 since it and mayonnaise have similar ingredients (eggs, dairy being the main ones if I recall correctly). So you shouldn't have to worry too much, especially if you give all ingredients involved a quick Google beforehand.\n\nI agree these are the kind of pranks that are fine in my opinion. Nothing wrong with it if you do it to some people you know and it's harmless like this. Even the early prank YouTube stuff was ok.\n\nIt's fine if you know your friend well enough that he won't mind getting slapped in the face with shaving cream or similar, the problem came when they all started outdoing eachother, and idiots started copying them.",

How are you a comedian?\n\nGeorge: he's right. I've never heard you laugh at a joke.\n\nElaine to George: I laugh at you.\n\nGeorge mumbles to himself and pops the newspaper open. : It's not THAT funny.\n\nElaine: ok, come on. Name one funny joke I didn't laugh at. \n\nJ: I---\n\nE: no. NO! I know you're about to try your new routine. I'm talking about objectively funny jokes that you've already told. We'll get expert opinions it ai still don't agree they are funny.\n\nJ: OK, George can be our judge.\n\nG: don't drag me int--\n\nE: George can't be the judge. George isn't funny either and he would just agree with you.\n\nG: I don't agree with everything Jerry says.\n\nJ: yes you do.\n\nG: ok, sometimes I do.\n\nE: Kramer. We'll call him over.\n\nJ: oh Kramer thinks everything is funny, but he never laughs either.\n\nE: exactly. He's the perfect judge. KRAMER!\n\nKramer pops through the door. \n\nK: at your service.\n\nJ: where you just listening at the door?\n\nKramer looks around suspiciously.\n\nK: If they listen, you listen back.\n\nJerry and Elaine shake their head, George folds up his paper to watch it unfold.\n\nE: listen, Jerry and I have a bet. A...$100 bet\n\nJ: well played. It's a bet.\n\nK: and you need a bookey? I'll call Joe Sacamonto.\n\nJ: no no, just to see if I'm funny or if Elaine has no sense of humor.\n\nK: oh...(waves hand at Jerry) you're funny.\n\nE: Jerry says I don't laugh at his jokes and I say they aren't funny \n\nK: Jerry is a comedian. The world says he's funny. Pay up.\n\nJerry points to Kramer : see?\n\nE: enough, just tell me one funny thi g I didn't laugh at.\n\nJ: I got you that gag gift for your birthday.\n\nE: That's a prank, not a joke.\n\nK: gag gifts are funny.\n\nG: I didn't hear about that. \n\nE: wait ...what gag gift?\n\nJ: the chocolates. You never said a word.\n\nE: how is chocolate a gag gift?\n\nJ: i dipped brussel sprouts in chocolate and rewrapped them.\n\nK, reaching in his pocket: that's funny.\n\nElaine, laughing: I regifted them to George.\n\nGeorge, swallowing.: Why would you do that?\n\nE: I'm trying to lose weight, I didn't want the temptation.\n\nJ: so you didn't even eat one? George, how were they?\n\nG: i regifted them too. To Kramer.\n\nE: you regifted my gift?!\n\nG:that you regifted first! i don't like the little nuts.\n\nLooking to Kramer, eating one of the chocolates. Everyone looking in horror.\n\nJ: can't you taste that?\n\nK: I love chocolate.\n\nE: were you not paying attention? That's a brussel sprout.\n\nKramer looking at it in confusion. Takes another bite.\n\nKramer, tearing up: I can't taste it.\n\nG,J,E at once: COVID!\n\nElaine pulls her mask up, Jerry sprays disinfectant everywhere, and George has headed for the fire escape.\n\n----\n\nOk, not my best /r/redditwritesseinfeld but I tried.

I scratched it and it was a 10k winner and I had a mini-heart attack.  \n\nDo I split it?  Do I even say it was a winner?  If I split it, will people think I should just give the whole thing over?  Do I even have to split it at all?  Will the entire office expect me to take them to a fancy lunch and drop a couple grand?  Everyone in the office will have an opinion and some will turn hostile and jealous.  This is about to be a can of worms.\n\nSo he comes back over and asks, \"Did you scratch it?\"  And I said, \"not yet\" and he walks away again.  I need time to think.\n\nI'm still contemplating what to do.  While doing that, I decide to turn it over and read how to claim it.  As you probably have guessed by now, it was a gag ticket.  Godfuckingdammitsomuch.\n\nI can't even imagine what stink it would have caused if I had said it wasn't a winner, everyone would have called me out for being horrible, which wouldn't be wrong.  I would have had a mark on me for the rest of my career there.\n\nI would rather hand over 5 grand not to have that stigma, I'm so glad I kept my mouth shut.  I think about this story every time someone gets busted lying.",

I just ripped it to shreds and flushed it down the toilet.\" The look on his face would've been priceless!",

You're socially obligated to get someone something for a certain occasion, even if they don't need anything and you don't know what they want. As a result, you're very likely to get them something they don't want or need. And what do you do with things you don't want or need? You can hold onto it until your house is filled with useless clutter, you can trash it, or you can give it away.\n\nIf the gift was heartfelt and sentimental, then yeah, giving it away is kinda jerkish. But if we're being honest, most gifts given for Christmas and etc. are only given because of the social expectation. So if the gift was only given to fulfill a social obligation and not very heartfelt, it's kinda hard to say that giving it away is a heartless move.\n\nRegifting is actually a very smart thing to do, because it simultaneously gets rid of something you don't want while also fulfilling a social obligation to someone else.",
