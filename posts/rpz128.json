  "text": "The fact that the government forgave literally billions in PPP loans to religious organizations should be illegal. The fact that the politicians refuse to forgive student loans for tens of millions of Americans shows they serve the fundies and not the people.\nBillions of dollars in PPP loans to churches have been forgiven. Basically religious institutions got free money from the government. \n\nBut the government refuses to forgive student loan debt for millions of Americans. \n\nThis is so fucked up. \n\nChurches got free money while people suffer under crippling debt. \n\nPeople deserved that money. Not your local con man who gives a speech twice a week.",

Several other Catholic congregations, schools, or institutions in Michigan got more than $1 million.\n\nTwo Jewish groups in Oakland County also each received $2 to $5 million in PPP loans, according to the data: Yeshiva Beth Yehudah, a Jewish day school in Oak Park and Southfield, and Jewish Vocational Service and Community Workshop in Southfield.\n\nPresbyterian Villages of Michigan, a faith-based nonprofit with 500 employees that has 30 locations and operates senior citizen homes, also got a $2 to $5 million loan, according to the PPP loan data.\" \n\nOkay. On the one hand yes, that is a lot of money. On the other hand those organizations are employing a lot of people. Detroit (I don't live there, but I do live in Michigan) probably can't afford to lose all those jobs, so it pays to keep those people employed (even if it's by religious orgs that effectively produce nothing). Also, like it or not, the majority of people in this country still want religious organizations and want people working in them to provide spiritual \"services\". Economics dictate that *somebody* is going to fill this gap. At least there are probably a lot of more-or-less normal people getting paid to work in these places, and probably some of the jobs are borderline secular or totally secular (such as in homes for the aged). It's not like hundreds of millions of dollars are all getting poured into the personal bank account of some fatass pedophile priest. We're talking about hundreds/thousands of \"small potatoes\" workers here.",

The people in power decided that the PPP was a tool to help struggling businesses weather the storm of the pandemic. We can debate who should have gotten it or that it was to easy to get forgiveness, but once it was in motion with the rules setup as they were it was going to run it's course.\n\nI didn't think religious organizations should be part of it, but they were and they had the same rules as everyone else for how much they could get and if it was forgivable. The $ amounts weren't arbitrary, but based on documented payroll. And forgiveness well relativity easy still required documentation of certain conditions.\n\nI haven't checked in a while but last time I did the PPP didnt even hit the amounts of funding it was allocated, less organizations took it than they planned for.\n\nI think they should have had stricter rules for forgiveness, and been more limiting so it was primarily organizations with true pandemic related hardships, but that's not the world we live in.",

Did you read the article or just look at the headline? The definition of literal I'm referring to is just as valid and has been for a long time. For you to claim otherwise IS a misuse though. \n\nhttps://blogs.illinois.edu/view/25/96439\n\nSo who needs more schooling here?

The sad thing is that, even the PPP money that went to businesses didn't always get distributed to the employees. I'm willing to bet that holds true among the churches that received those loans as well. Direct payments to employees would have been ideal, but that would have prevented the rich folks from getting money they neither needed nor deserved.",

It was meant to cover ALL business expenses, that includes payroll and everything else. \n\nOnly a certain percent had to be used on payroll costs in order to be forgiven.

Employers pay an equivalent amount of Social Security and Medicare taxes as the employee pays (7.65% total each from the employee and employer) on what the employee earns. But that's a drop in the bucket to what most churches make, and it STILL is not \"the church\" paying it's fair share of taxes. \n\nWhat I've proposed for decades is have churches use the business tax structure with exemptions on all income that goes toward doing the things churches were given tax exempt status for to begin with. Every penny a church spends on *ACTUALLY* feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, housing the homeless, helping the widows and orphans with child care and job training, could be directly written off against total income and not taxed. But printing and handing out bibles and other religious propaganda doesn't count, *AND* they can't make \"attending services\" or other indoctrination a contingency for receiving help. Even their Jesus said people would know they're his disciples by the work they do. In my 6+ decades, I haven't seen much that truly impressed me-- even when I was a church-going Christian and my entire family were out doing the good works. It always seemed to be the same few (not wealthy) families out doing the work while the rich bastards took the credit. And this wasn't once or twice, or just one church. It's systemic and I've seen it my entire life.",

Look up any Bond mutual fund and you\u2019re likely to see in its categories of holdings a portion of CMO or CMO like securities. CMO stands for collateralized mortgage obligation, which is someone bundling a bunch of mortgage debt together and selling it for interest. Someone can then bundle that derivative with other derivatives and sell those for interest, and so on. They do the same thing with student loan debt, and many other kinds of debt (auto, payday, etc). It gives short term liquidity and helps accelerate the economy, but the intrinsic value is about as much as my Diet Coke Monkey NFT. As long as a bunch don\u2019t get called or a huge chunk doesn\u2019t default, no problem.

One party promises to obstruct the government as much as possible, does everything to subvert voters, and entrenches the power of capital. They actually do these things. Republicans consistently gerrymander, block judicial appointments by Democrats, repeal legislation to protect the working class, etc. Recently they also collectively decided not to investigate an insurrection and attempt to overthrow the results of a fair election while at the same time claiming that it was the other party's fault. \n\nClaiming that it doesn't matter who you vote for president is at best misguided and at worst actively encouraging a fascist political party to seize power. Not to mention there are thousands of other elections across the country that are for political offices other than president, most of which have no party affiliation whatsoever.",

      "text": "The economic impact of forgiving millions of student loans would be catastrophic. There's an interesting video on the matter, I believe it's called \"money as debt\". The basic premise of it is that, the more a bank lends, the more it can lend.\n\nIt revolves around the idea that you can lend out money you don't have based on someone's _promise_ to pay you for a loan.\n\nSo they can lend out that same money again, and again, and again. Racking up millions/billions/trillions in interest payments for money lent that they don't have.\n\nForgiving a few dozen entities (or even a few hundred or even thousands) of their debts has a far smaller economic impact. Sure, it's a few million each, but far less than the 1.7 trillion in student debt.\n\nFor organizations that don't even pay taxes.\n\nIt would be far more likely for the members of Parliament to approve a repayment assistance programme to basically have the government pay a portion (or all) of your monthly dues on student debts. Then they're maintaining the level of debts owed to the banks so they can earn that sweet interest, and \"helping\" the students get on their feet so they can \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps\" and finish the debt themselves.\n\nWhen you look at the total cycle, it's sadistic. Someone from a poor family (or even middle class, honestly) takes out a loan to get an education, then gets thrust into a world of hurt, crippling debts and the treadmill of interest, for years and years, while they can't find a job in their field (they've been outsourced to \"low-cost centers\"), so they work minimum wage as their employable skills from those few years in post-secondary school are withering away to nothing for years and years. Meanwhile, the fat cats at the schools are living it up on your loaned money while the teachers beg for scraps, the banks are laughing and rolling in all your interest payments as they out-source your job to India or Puerto Rico or whatever, and everyone gets rich except you.\n\nCompare with someone in an upper class family, where their education is paid for by their family, they walk out with their diploma and zero debts, walk into a highly skilled and in demand job from either the family run business(es) or a friend of the family's business, make top dollar for what they do and get to keep 100% of it for themselves.\n\nThose with money tend to get a faster lead and better chances of success than the unwashed masses. Every once and a while someone breaks the mold and gets a good, well-paying job straight out of school on chance, but it's by far not the default outcome that people want you to believe happens with \"higher education\". Those exceptions can pay their education off in a matter of years instead of decades, and actually have a chance to move up in the world. Those success stories are the carrot that gets people to keep paying educational institutions for paper that for most, is a decoration and commemoration of a future dream that never happened.  A Requiem to a dream, if you will.\n\nThis won't change because too many people with too much money have a stake in you continuing to pay interest on those loans. The best you can hope for is to have someone else pay it for you, through taxes. The people with the money won't let you get out of the debts by any other means.\n\nAnd truely that's what happens, I've heard stories that educational debts have survived everything, including, but not limited to bankruptcy (often education is specifically excluded from this) and even death. I've heard stories of educational debts falling to the next of kin....\n\nThe whole thing is a sham for a worthless piece of paper to put on your wall, that you can lament about as you put on your Wendy's uniform and go to work. The rich and powerful want it that way.",

The largest block of eligible voters don't vote for Democrats or Republicans; they stay home. Maybe if the Democrats tried to run on popular policies and appeal to the millions of people disillusioned with our two party theater, more of them would win. The fact they consistently fail to do this and seem to spend more time pushing back on their left flank than people like Manchin and Sinema while insisting the latter are essentially the only reason we don't have everything we want leads me to believe the party as a whole isn't sincere about wanting to help people as their first priority. When Republicans insist that they value freedom and prosperity but do little more when in power than persecute social minorities and craft legislation to benefit the wealthy, most of us logically conclude they're not being honest about their goals. Why shouldn't we apply the same standard to the Democrats?",

The PPP costs less for taxpayers & is better for our economy vs letting people lose their jobs. It\u2019s not just \u201cgiven to the employer,\u201d the employer has to distribute it to their workers. The employer is basically just a pass-through. And from the start, PPP loans were expected to be forgiven in most cases.\n\nAny employer could apply for a PPP loan: for-profit businesses or non-profits like food banks, shelters, YMCAs, and yes churches too. If you paid staff, you could apply for PPP. Not allowing churches to apply would have been religious discrimination. Further, considering how many food pantries and homeless shelters are run by churches, you\u2019d be shutting down operations that unemployed people need, during a crisis when they have never been more desperately needed.\n\nThere are lots of things to complain about re: churches, but them being allowed to apply for PPP and have the loan forgiven same as any other employer is not one of them.",

We paid them to take free money and still allow them to claim losses for the things we paid.\n\n\nAnd then there is the fact that 1% of \u201cborrowers\u201d took 25% of the loans\u2026",

Inciting violence isn't, but hate is, especially since that had a very generic definition.\n\n> Tormenting non-binary folks, trans persons, gays, and queers is free speech?\n\nDepends what you mean by tormenting. It's no different if they torment then for how they walk or how they dress.   Is you attacking the religious considered tormenting by that same definition?  I get you loathe this specific action, and I agree, but to extend it to neuter the first, fuck that.\n\n> Conversion therapy is free speech?\n\nForcing it on someone clearly isn't.  Advocating it is.  Just like idiots advocating ivermectin.  But the world where the government says what you can and can't advocate isn't one I want to see.  Next time you talk of restricting rights based on your opinion, imagine Trump had that power and how he would abuse it.\n\n> Denying women their basic rights is free speech?\n\nNo.  Advocating what rights should exist and for who is.  \n\n> Religion clearly goes against common sense and equality.\n\nAnd conservatives will point to the left and say communism and socialism are evils.  You can't just outlaw people from advocating things you disagree with.  Shit you go beyond that.  You say because religious groups advocate things you disagree with, all of them can't exist, by force of the government.  Well maybe whatever groups you active to shouldn't exist because you are advocating authoritarianism...\n\n> Religion clearly goes against common sense and equality\n\nAgreed, but to effectively cut off any voice you deem not in those interests is evil.  Sorry dude, but you need to look in the mirror.  Fight the bullshit and horrible ideas of religion.  But don't become a fascist to do it",

You see the financial big boys were betting big on a financial collapse due to covid, but instead the stimulus efforts, and the death of boomer dragons, gave us historical jumps in economic growth. On top of that many big time illegal practices were revealed in cellar boxing a number of companies, and when retail investors found out after being flushed with stimulus money, they turned the screws by buying up companies with greater than 100% short interest being held against them. The result is that some of our largest financial institutions are on the ropes and are barely keeping themselves alive on a daily basis. Taking out the supporting card of SLABS right now via debt cancelation would remove them as a source of collateral, and possibly bring the whole house of cards down. This is why so many are investing in things like gamestop that have been ultra shorted. When the house falls those shorted companies are going to explode in value temprorarily as short positions are forced closed.\n\nIt is the same reason biden did nothing when the republican states axed unemployment months early, people where taking that money and investing in these shorted stocks, putting huge pressure on the big guys.\n\nAfter the midterms he may not give as much of a fuck, and actually pull the trigger causing an economic collapse, that will likely be mostly resolved before the presidential election.",

If you can\u2019t find a job to pay for your ridiculous expensive degrees, it doesn\u2019t mean your rights are being denied.

Financial institutions and investment firms buy these securities not to earn meager interest payments, but as collateral to borrow against. Say one of these securities has a 5% yield. Firms can buy these for $95 and receive $100 at the time of maturity. The $100 is its nominal value. Since these securities/bonds are 100% safe (they will garnish your wages if you default on the student loans), firms can borrow at or near the nominal value, meaning they can buy these for $95 a piece, and can take out a loan against them and receive $99 or $100 to invest elsewhere or increase liquidity. \n\nIn other words, you don't owe the federal government your student loan payments, they have already gotten their money back and wiped them off their balance sheets. You are now indirectly making payments to just rich assholes and hedge funds. And if that debt were canceled, the federal government would most likely have to pay back these rich asshokes and banks to prevent causing any hiccups in the financial markets, and they just don't have the cash on hand to do that.",

I knew a lot of ministers. Most churches are intended to be for-profit.  They just extract the profits differently than corporations and taxable small businesses.\n\nChurches get away with all kinds of shady operations that non-religious non-profits get away with.  In the US all non-profits must file 990 forms with the IRS every year.  If they are paying their organizers or leaders too much they are in big troubles.  Churches do not have to file 990 forms.  They are exempt from most financial reporting.  They enjoy exemptions like the \"Parsonage Allowance\" that allows the church to pay their ministers with housing that is not charged to the minister's income tax.  That is how you get Televangelists living in $10 million mansions that are completely tax exempt.  Even the ministers of modest churches in my community live in small mansions complete with inground swimming pools and paid lawn service.  They go on tax-exempt \"retreats.\"  Those retreats are on cruise ships, ski lodges, and tropical locations.  The same ministers talk about how little they are paid.  But they neglect to mention all of the perks.  Did I mention the church-owned luxury SUV they drive?\n\nI used to work in a job that involved church real estate.  There are so many shady deals under the guise of church operations.  They would not be permitted to any other organiation, including non-profits.  But prosecutors, the Justice Department, IRS, and SEC are extremely reluctant to look into any church activities.",

      "text": "That's because the churches have lobbyists and are organized. Nobody advocates for students. That's why college students in America need to belong automatically to a union of students. There are already student union centers in every campus. They're just being used for the wrong purpose. They should be used to collectively bargain for better student rights, lower tuition, and debt forgiveness at the federal level. 10 bucks from every college student in America would buy some serious lobby power. If all American college students were members of one union the Democrats would have no choice but to take them seriously. Right now students have no power and think that if they tweet enough then something will change. Power never concedes nothing without a demand. That's not my idea, it's Frederick Douglass.",
