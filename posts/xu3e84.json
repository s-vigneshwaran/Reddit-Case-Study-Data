Yet i'm pretty happy that such issues get to be talked about nowadays rather than ignored as it was for the past two decades. there is some upgrades, we just have to make sure that the word keep on spreading and make more and more people aware of it though generations to come, we will never truly get rid of how we are seen as men, but we can make sure that we are treated with at least half the respect that is given to women.",
