  "text": "TIFU by going on a date with a girl from Tinder who seemed way too good to be true and not seeing the red flags.\nI (23M) was talking to this girl (23F) for a week on Tinder and Instagram. She was gorgeous and she seemed very fun and outgoing but she did have a investment girl boss vibe to her (and that's ok but I should've seen it coming). \n\nI asked her for a coffee date and she says yes, we meet up and she looks good but not exactly like her photos, no problem there let's see if we connect I thought.\n\nThe first 10mins goes great, conversation is flowing and I ask her if she wants some coffee (after all we're at a coffee shop on a coffee date), she says no, because she had some earlier (first red flag, I mean who goes on a coffee date but drinks some just before the actual date?)\n\nA tells me to go and get one for myself if I want. Alright no problem, I go and get my coffee and when I come back, there's another girl at our table. \n\nShe says, hey this is my partner (we'll call her B), I was working with her earlier. That's when it hit me that this wasn't a date lol.\n\nB starts asking me questions about my job, my studies and asks me If I would listen to their business plan so that I could make more money each month (lmao).\n\nSo she takes out a notepad and starts explaining me their business model and how much money I would make If I would find 3 other persons who would find 3 other people themselves, etc. \n\nI straight up tell her : \"So this is like a pyramid scheme right? This ain't no date?\" To which A responds : \"Oh it is a date but you seemed like a cool person to become our partner (lmao what) and this isn't a pyramid scheme, it's multi-level-marketing (MLM)\". Okay so exactly the same thing. I couldn't believe that this was happening to me.\n\nOh boy, so I sat there for legit 15 more mins and listened to them explain to me how I could make up to 5k a month if I were to get 100 people to join this business.\n\nI told them I had to leave to go to the vet with my dog. They didn't seem happy that I wasn't interested in their MLM lmao. I laughed so much on the way home that I was crying. \n\nTLDR : Went on a coffee date with a gorgeous girl from Tinder and when I went to get my coffee she texted her business partner to come and pitch me their pyramid scheme business model for 30mins.\n\nEdit 1 : Thank you so much for the awards, upvotes and comments! I did report A's profile on Tinder as spam as soon as I got home. The product they were trying to sell were some vitamins, proteins, Omega-3 tablets and some \"very good collagen\" lol.",

I\u2019ve been with my fianc\u00e9e for 10 years; so before Tinder was even an app, or if it was one, it wasn\u2019t as popular at the time and we didn\u2019t know about it. \n\nI take it you are either in a committed relationship with someone, or with yourself? Or you just are fortunate enough not to have had to report anyone recently? \n\nIf it\u2019s the former and not the latter, and your relationship with your partner (or yourself) goes well, you\u2019ll be so amazed at the changes in dating and finding partners and eve life partners. \n\nTwo of our friends have been dating for four years and they met on Tinder. They are now getting married! It\u2019s crazy how much the style of dating has changed.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I joke that if we ever break up or divorce (after we\u2019re married) then we won\u2019t even know how to date since we don\u2019t even know how to use Tinder. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9e likes to get on our best friends\u2019 Tinder accounts and help them find girls when they come and stay with us for awhile to get out of the city life (LA and NYC) and it\u2019s hilarious. \n\nOne time she accidentally swiped the wrong way for a girl our best friend (basically brother) did NOT find attractive or was not in the least bit interested in haha. He wasn\u2019t mad but he did find it funny. \n\nOur best friends say all the time they wished they had a relationship that didn\u2019t involve Tinder, but they just use it for hookups, not for actual finding a significant other.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the long story, your comment just reminded me of mine and my fianc\u00e9e not knowing a damn thing about Tinder and feeling old as shit and I just wanted to say it only gets crazier and worse (or better, depending how you look at it) from here haha.",

Competition is fierce. not having good money and a decent places CAN be detrimental. it requires game and a lot of social awareness they actually teach classes on it. but, a lot of it is men noting knowing to ....date or not understanding women.\n\nthere is also a lot of low quality people on tinder, HOWEVER it depends on the area and YMMV.\n\ni quit tinder a year ago along with a few other apps.",

Or we will do 2 or 3 40h projects in a week. Best part is they profit margin on these products is 40% and im talking final bill in the 100s of thousands. \n\nIts just the way the design and engineering field works. You have 2 paths. Contract on a project basis and get paid very good but most projects are only 3-6 months so risk is high, or w2 but you get shafted on pay in exchange for steady pay and pay through the luls. Ill go weeks at times without a project and just doing upkeep/optimization which is a cost for the company in there eyes.",

I.e. you are one of the starters who brings in 100 people, and those 100 people bring in 100 people each.\n\nFun fact. It doesn't have to \"sell goods\" either.\n\nMost commission based brokerages do this. Real estate, financial advisors etc. \n\nLet's assume you're a high earner. You get a 90/10 split. A newcomer gets a 60/40 split.\n\nMost real estate agents know this, because they likely started at a 60/40 split before earning high. Well.. they like to bring in new people for 2 reasons.   \n1) The referring real estate agent to the brokerage gets a % cut of the 40%. (Let's say 5%) \n\n2) New people in financial advisors/real estate etc. usually bring in friends and family as clients... then.. if they sink, they sink.\n\nBut the recruiter doesn't care. They just pulled in 5% extra revenue off of you, and you win, they win. You lose, they still won a little. They have 0 losses in recruiting you.\n\nSo so many people get pulled in by high $ commission as the selling point, only to be used up for their connections and then dropped.",

So a new agent who needs constant help and uses a bunch of staff time while making say 50k in commissions maybe is paying 25k a year for office space, that help, copiers, admin staff etc.  A more experienced agent making 200k in commissions might pay the same 25k but now hes closer to 90/10 split.  \n\nAt some point people aren't dumb and understand the services they get cost money that is generally fixed so the percents get negotiated down and capped.\n\nThe big difference is the agents are producing actual sales vs the mlm stuff where it just is getting people under you who pay fees without producing shit",

Worked at a real estate brokerage for about 2 years doing the entire back end finances and accounting.\n They had a commissions plan breakdown and each person had a their own plan.\nThe only difference is the brokerage takes less of a cut. But the brokerage is fine with that because 2 agents selling is better than 1. Etc.\n\nHappens in financial advice too.\nI won't name companies but a wealth management group in Canada interviewed me straight out of university.\n\nWhen I started out my career years ago I had an interview with them and they literally broke it down that that's what they do.\nIts essentially cold calling for sales to try to get people to invest money with them.\n\nBut.. it was literally them telling me to bring over my family and friends first. \nAnd that \"if you know anyone else that you refer and joins as an agent you get a 1% commission from all their lifetime earnings\"\n\nNow obviously not everyone is in that gig.\nBut brokerages are literally all about trying to grow their employees (contractors) so they can retain more clients.\nWe had a recruiter/agent working on commissions. Literally pulling in agents from other agencies to work for us. Or telling friends and family to become an agent because it's good money. \n\nWe had about 150 agents.\nTop agents were making a million a year. Bottom..maybe $2000? These people got suckered into thinking it's easy money. Or had a relative who was selling a home and they didn't know how to get clients after.\n\nBut the recruiter was tied to every deal behind the scenes as a referral payment. \nSo let's say you sold a house and total commission was $20,000.\nHalf that goes to the other brokerage.\nSo your brokerage gets $10,000.\nYoure on a 60/40 split. Meaning you get $6000. You don't know the recruiter took a cut because it's not your loss.\n Brokerage gets $4000.\n\nBut before brokerage gets paid. The recruiter gets 5% of the $4000.\nSo $200 for doing nothing except bringing them in.\nNow it's like \"big whoop\". But if you brought in 20 agents and they sell 10 homes each.. you made $40,000 doing nothing except convincing them to join. \nAnd the brokerage is happy because they have more market share and 20 more agents and 200 clients.\n\n\nWhich.. literally is how MLMs work. \nNow in the case of canada.. recent years have been easy for real estate agents because homes would sell like candy.

Some brokerages take a cut too.\nFor example.\nYou work for a branch of Remax or ColdwellBanker or Century 21.\nThey charge a $50 monthly fee to brokerages per agent. Plus another $50 for brand marketing.\nThe brokerage may charge the agent $120. \nThey may waive it for a short period.\nThey might charge you $100. But its up to the brokerage.\n\nThen there's office rental space. If you work there you may have to agree to an office space rental fee. \nThe office I worked for didn't have that fee because the owner got rid of those fees to entice new people.\n\nBut many other brokerages still had them or still have them. \n\nHell check out eXp realty. They literally pitch it the same as an MLM. \n\nJust Google \"exp realty mlm\" \nIts very similar to Keller Williams model... hell check out KW mlm. \n\nBut you know, the only difference is..  they don't jam it down your throat to recruit new people.\nThat is..  if you're not involved.\nMy office had about 15 satellite offices. 15 managers who took a bonus on the performance of agents they brought in. \nEveryone was encouraged to bring in new talent and they mention it during the hiring phase.\n\"You can profit share if you recruit someone\"",

She was cool to hang out w/ I guess but beyond that she was the type to fall for MLMs even though I don\u2019t recall that happening.\n\nShe\u2019d participate in penny auctions though & instead of doing the math on her loses she\u2019d tell you the great deals she got \ud83d\ude02. I was like girl.. I know you wasted a ton of money on those sun glasses, don\u2019t even pretend w/ me.\n\n2 other things that worried me about her besides finding out she was mixing drugs of who knows what was her being attracted to army life & not having to think for herself & \u201ckush\u201d jobs that pay well but don\u2019t expect much.\n\nI was like seriously depressed by her talking like that \ud83d\ude02\u2026 just like.. all that sounds really horrible to me - I want difficulty & rewarding things about my job(s) almost irregardless of pay & I\u2019d never thrive in an environment where I\u2019m not to think for myself.\n\nBut I dunno - people that don\u2019t grow up in fundamentalist environments often do romanticize environments of structure & not having to think for themselves in various ways imho. They really just don\u2019t want to grow up & be an adult imo.",

There just wasn\u2019t any excuse for her behavior & I was getting tired of justifying her mood swings as \u201cmaybe she\u2019s had a bad day\u201d or any other thing. There really was no rhyme or reason to her behaviors.\n\nLiterally the only person I have a story about & having sent her a post card from where I was telling her to F- off.\n\nTbh we were such different individuals I dunno how we remained friends for as long as we did \ud83d\ude02\u2026 I\u2019m guessing though that I was likely one of her only friends at the time because I hadn\u2019t thrown in the towel w/ her like others had likely done sooner.\n\nI probably had some self esteem issues & too could sense a similar level of loneliness w/ them as I had experienced once.

Why don't you meet us at...\" ...and it was some cult-y pseudo church thing. They were recruiting me to join their Jesus brigade. Dangling friendship and cute chicks as bait to sucker me in.

There are just way too many men, and nowhere near enough (legitimate) women.   This leads to a situation where attractive women basically have the pick of the litter.   Women can be selective because they know that if this one doesn't work out, there are plenty of other attractive men on the site to choose from, along with plenty of older guys who have no issues with being openly used for their money if it means they occasionally get to bang a younger, attractive woman.  Guys don't have the opportunity to be nearly as selective as women because there are far fewer of them, which means they bascially *have* to hope that this time, the woman is actually real instead of another bot or scammer.  \n\nAnd if a woman goes on a \"date\" and something like this happens, the result is very likely going to be exactly what you see here.  Guy laughs it off and leaves, women move on to hunt down their next victim, everybody forgets about it in about 5 minutes, and nobody gets in trouble.  But if it's the man going out and pulling something like this, it's going to come off as incredibly creepy at best, and could even lead to having charges pressed against him if he's a little too aggressive with his sales pitch and the woman starts to feel threatened.  There's no realistic situation where a guy could run something like this and not quickly find himself neck deep in shit.  \n\nThe fact that the ratios are so lopsided can only create a situation where it can be a pretty enjoyable experience for women who get to select from a variety of attractive men looking for dates while men basically have to hope that this time the hottie with the nice rack isn't the third bot that he ran into today.",

From the OP post, OP seemed to still be under the impression, that it *might* have been a date. I knew that it wasn't. But if I called OP an idiot or made him feel stupid about it, that would just be a dick move. That's why I phrased it the way I did. I don't need a dozen replies telling me the signs were obvious. I *know* it was never a date. I was just trying to clear that up to the OP the nicest way possible. Literally bump off with some of these replies man.",

She starts asking about my future plans and it was a relief to have a lady be upfront with her expectations in a partner and knows exactly what she wants. Things were going so unbelievable smooth. My confidence was over 9000 and i felt like i hit a glitch in the matrix with this one. She was a cute driven nurse and I thought about calling my mom after coffee. Then before I could finish my cup she is laying out the notepad, books this was amway btw. I almost started laughing right there too. Of course I got bait and switched. Pretty effective way of recruiting I must say. I swore to take that experience to the grave. Even my younger female colleague witnessed this chick put the moves on me and asked for my number. She was like that \"She's into you. You better not flake on her\" and would constantly ask to read my texts and was also reading like she was aggressively pursuing me. She always tries to ask what happened and I just tell her the truth. We are just not compatible. For context she waited for the 3rd date to bust that out. It was all so surreal",

I forgot what specific sect or group they were, but they wanted to talk to me about how God was actually two beings (male and female) and then also attempted to convince me about how different selected prophetic stories were enough to be mind blowing because the stories predated scientific studies of the same topics (for example, some random story about a saint who, through a series of observations, learned about the different cycles of water in nature. I had to explain to them that learning through observation is not new. Like navigating with stars and whatnot). I was too nice. I stayed for like an hour just humoring and rebuttaling all of their arguments.\n\nThw worst part was that the coffee they had was a keurig machine (I still drank it). I was bamboozled.\n\nApparently this specific group ended up building a church up near a town where I live now and they solicit people in Walmart.

Our first \"date\" was at an event she invited me to where we were building bird houses at this new community center with underprivileged kids and their families. It turns out she was one of the people running the event (didn't know this). Without sounding like an insensitive asshole, it was nice to volunteer my time but it was not a great first date. We spent little time together and she basically put me to work overseeing one of the building stations outside in the heat. I think I got a paragraph worth of conversation with her in the 8 hours I was there! At the end, I asked her if she wanted to meet up again later that afternoon for dinner and drinks. She declined because of how tired she was but had the balls to ask me to volunteer again the following week, at a different event. My initial response was to make something up for not being able to help, which I did at first. Halfway through the week I changed my mind, told her my original plans fell through and decided to go for it. Although we didnt get much in person time together, our phone & text conversations were fun and I really liked this girl. Plus based on what she told me about this event, it would be less chaotic and would allow us to spend more time together. The morning of \"date\" #2, I packed board shorts and a towel (she told me that water would be involved) and I headed her way. When I got to her house she told me to park my car and get in hers, she then drove us to the beach. She made up the whole volunteer event for that day just to see if I was truly interested in her. It was a little crazy but I kinda dug it. We ended up having an amazing weekend. We dated for years but eventually drifted apart, no regrets there, it was a fun run. But I was close to saying \"nope\" after that first \"date\".",

I got pulled into two different \"interviews\" when I was younger, thinking that I was interviewing for basically a part time evening job, and thought it was weird to be doing a job interview at a Subway, but figured that since it was basically just side work, that maybe the dude didn't have an office, and was just being super casual. Then he gave me his whole breakdown, and I was like \"thanks, but no thanks!\" Then, dumbass young me, my buddy was telling me that he had a \"sales\" gig, and that I could pretty much work my schedule around my regular work schedule. Now, you would think that after being burned the last time, and the fact that this one was at a coffee shop, I would have all the alarm bells going off. And the thought did cross my mind. But I figured there was no way my buddy would try to get me caught up in a pyramid scheme! Yep, I was wrong! After I kindly noped my way out of that one, I decided then and there, unless they have an actual office/permanent location, or I knew for a 100% fact that there was zero possibility of it being an \"MLM opportunity\", I would never be meeting for any type of job like that again. It sucks too, because the way my luck goes, one of these day someone will probably want to offer me the gig of a lifetime, but want to meet at a gas station, and I will be like \"oh, hell no!\" and miss out! Op, if you are ever in that position again, try to get a piece of paper somehow, and act really interested, like you are taking notes. Then, just basically draw a diagram of a pyramid scheme on the paper, and give it to them as you are about to leave",

Still laugh just thinking about it. He went on a few times now and then for a few months trying to convince me but I just shut him down. He invested a ton of money into it and obviously was desperate at that point. It's a shame people fall for that shit, ruining their economy and relations to those around you as you desperately try to make back what you've lost..",

      "text": "I met a nice young man back in the nineties at church, when I was young and still single.   The only problem was, he was heavily brainwashed  by people who had lured him into the cult of AMWAY - one of the most famous multi level marketing companies, ever.   \n\nIt was absolutely disgusting, the things that they were using to pull him and others in, and keep them \"mesmerized\".   The gaudy flaunting of and bragging about wealth by top leadership at their big convention meetings was debased.   It was also creepy, because as an outsider, I was not brainwashed like the rest of them.  I had already been through all these things, and I knew what they were really about.   You had to be very careful around them, because these people were so committed to their group think, if you dared say anything against it, or even have the wrong expression on your face, they would ostracize you completely.   It was literally as if there was a lynch mob ready to pounce, at the slightest hint of non conformity (somewhat reminds me of a few sub reddits \ud83d\ude06).   \n\nWe had also known a really nice married couple who were friends of our family, when I was younger. I remember the wife talking about how Amway had completely bankrupted their lives. The people above them were convincing them even to sell the furniture in their home to be able to invest in their business, and they eventually realized that they were being used.    It was awful what they went through.   \n\nI saw the same thing in this young man, as they were convincing him to constantly be paying for these \"peptalk/coaching\" cassette tapes that the people who recruited him would make for him to listen to all the time.  He wasn't making any $, but he was investing all his hopes, dreams, energies, and money, into this idea of getting rich easy.   They especially take over your mind, they want you to constantly be thinking just how they tell you to, constantly finding ways to pull others in.   It is like they want to strip away everything about your thinking, goals, interests and beliefs before you joined, and just make you a cog in their machine, another step in their ladder to \"the top\", to big money.   His parents were pleading with me to help him, it was scaring them, seeing what was happening. I eventually talked him into seeing the light, but had to move cautiously, it took time.   He actually seemed relieved, in the end.   I seriously deprogrammed someone, in a way.   Crazy.  \n\nNow they have rebranded the company's recruiting/brainwashing \"jargon\", and are careful not to use the word Amway to newcomers, lest they scare people off.   \n\nMy stepfather also has always been an Amway enthusiast. But my mom knew it was a bunch of baloney, and told him he had to find side gigs to pay for his addiction to the multi level marketing scheme.   There just wasn't money in the regular budget for this type of thing to go on, year after year.    It's been decades, he's hasn't made a penny at it yet.",

However, in the real world, a scheme can have elements of both of course, but the definitive difference is if there is a sign-up fee due to the recruiter (independently of any future sales of non-recruitment goods/services).

We go to Cora's which is a super busy breakfast restaurant and a few mins in to them making normal small talk with me she looks at her boyfriend's watch and goes \"omg babe, is your watch scratched already? We should call the lawyer\"... I was like a lawyer? That's weird. They proceeded to have a very scripted sounding conversation and told me a story about some random person who got stuck in another country with no passport and stuff cuz it got stolen and a lawyer got them out. \n\nThey THEN proceeded to take out their fucking laptop in the middle of a super busy restaurant that had a line of people waiting to be seated and give me a whole business presentation on some lawyer thing that I still have no idea really what it was because I was just so embarrassed and pissed off that they tricked me into this and I was trapped since they were my ride home that I wasn't paying attention at all. \n\nThis fun little \"let's get together and catch up!\" Was the last time I ever talked to her... Which was probably about 7 years ago now. Sorry for the rant but it still boils my blood that she and her boyfriend did that to me hahaha. I remember looking at the waitresses every time they came by just pleading with my eyes for them to tell us we needed to leave because we were over the max time allowed to sit after eating but unfortunately they never did",
