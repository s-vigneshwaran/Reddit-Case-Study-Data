I have no fucking clue what in the actual fuck happened in that one case where the woman was being charged. The more extended detail was the prosecutor pushed for a murder charge on the abortion. Then later dropped it after admitting she did not commit a crime. This was BEFORE details of a miscarriage came out. Everywhere I look, there's no detailed information.\n\nThe laws don't allow the police to arrest you for it.  But someone can sue who ever assisted you, as they are publicly enforced.\n\n As for the kidnapping? My dad worked family violence for some time in his career. They handle most domestic violence cases, abuse, and kidnappings. Most of the people hated this particular law as it makes very little sense. A lot of times their hands are tied because of the language of the caller alone. \"Can't find my kid\" versus someone just yanked the child off the street and ran. Which... Details of what he saw isn't ever pretty. In short. Kids are usually killed very quickly. Or worse. And yeah... There really is shit worse than death.\n\nOne of the officers he worked with was fired and charged for homicide after killing a handcuffed suspect. The sight was that bad.",

Because I owned any kind of property at all, I was disqualified based on the ground of \"assets\". Yes they literally wanted me to sell my condo and rent in order to get assistance, thereby meaning I would require it for substantially longer to fix things and end up in an even worse situation.

We arrived on scene and let\u2019s just say it was not optimal living conditions, the house was a complete mess, the parents had clearly smoked packs a day indoors (they smoked the entire time we were there), they were probably drug addicts. Sad situation all around. \n\nThe officer was familiar with the family and she had runaway before, and he had a feeling he knew where she went. Sure enough, we went to some apartment complex and he found her, I\u2019m not to sure what the environment there was as I had to stay in the car but ultimately she didn\u2019t want to go home and the officer had to either take her home or to juvie. She chose juvie. \n\nThe family has had CPS involved multiple times (the officer reported this situation as well) and yet the children are never taken. It\u2019s fucking tragic for everyone involved.\n\nThe officer knows she shouldn\u2019t be living in that situation but can\u2019t do anything. The child can\u2019t leave and CPS is seemingly useless. Should that child\u2019s only choices be juvie or \u201chome\u201d?\n\nEdit: I should add that the parents did not at all seem worried about the child. Seemed more like they were punishing her knowing the officer would likely have to take her to juvie.",

It really does seem like in the 70s and 80s, which most of the forensics files cases were based on, there were a significant amount of people targeting *and* killing boys.\n\nThat being said there were plenty of ones targeting girls or adults as well. \n\n\n>maybe foster care system plays a part as well?

You're coming across as \"they're runaways who are just trying to avoid juvie and their parents aren't that concerned\".\n\nThe solution should really be more robust social services and not sending runaways to juvie if their home life is bad. Even early emancipation processes and funding if a kid's life is really that bad so they can be alone in a safe location, able to make a safe living without putting themselves at the same risk of a runaway.\n\nThe solution just isn't \"don't take runaways seriously\".",

Tylenol is *probably* okay, but research from this year calls that into question. So the safest call is \"No pain medications.\"\n* No hot baths\n* No deli meat\n* No sushi\n* No bagged salad\n* No runny eggs\n* No steak that is less than well done\n* No sleeping in any other position than on your left side. \n\nNow... I *want* this baby and I want only the best for her. But I'm still not following all these rules. Why in God's name would I follow all these rules to benefit a fetus I don't want and am only carrying by force? There's going to be a lot of fucked up babies. Or there's going to be a lot of women being confined during their pregnancies and forced to follow all these rules.\n\nThe only people who should be pregnant are the people who *want* to be pregnant.",

Kids who are actually kidnapped represents a vanishingly small number of reported cases. And of those, 80% are kidnapped by a noncustodial parent (mom or dad). \n\nPolice shouldn't immediately assume that Timmy was kidnapped by Ted Bundy. That would be poor detective work. First, the parents should contact the friends and relatives. If the kid can't be found that way, then there is reason to worry. \n\nThe most likely situation is that the kid either ran away or is out doing something mom and dad wouldn't like (e.g. snuck out to go to a concert). \n\nI know parents panic when their kids vanishes for a while. The idea that police won't jump on the \"John Wayne Gacey has my kid\" can make these parents angry. They have a right to be angry. However, they don't have a right to expect the police to contact all their friends and family for them. They do their job, and then the police can do theirs.",

You can recognize two separate issues without justifying either, just an FYI. Both are problems that need resources to be fixed, difference is a first world nation can actually dedicate resources and report on those problems and expect progress to be made on them. Which there will continue to be specifically because resources are dedicated to them.\n\nHave you ever lived in a country where there are aluminum towns with tens to hundreds of thousands of people in them with no running water or services? Where if you are driving anywhere around them if you stop even for a minute you are liable to get immediately killed, if not worse? \n\nYou thinking I was justifying one using the other is a sign of your bias and privilege.

Most of the time, either the kid wants to be gone, or is too young to know any better.\n\nEven the worst of people, like sexual predators, rarely take kids anymore. They groom them online and abuse them during the day. The odds of Ted Bundy taking your kid is less than 1%. It happens. The police simply can't assume the worst case scenario when the odds of it happening are so tiny. \n\nFor a police department, it isn't about cost. It is about manpower. \n\nA parent should first call friends and relatives. If their kid isn't hiding out there, and they haven't vanished with friends to do something mom and dad said no to, then you get the cops involved.",

Rather, the term BIPOC comes from a desire to differentiate between the *types* of experiences these groups have had.\n\nIt is true, for example, that many Asian-American immigrants were blatantly discriminated against in many terrible ways. However, it\u2019s also true that for the most part, they were not forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands and used as slaves, nor did they have their native lands stolen from them. Pointing out this distinction isn\u2019t intended to diminish the experience of Asian-Americans but rather to state the differences.\n\nIn addition, generally speaking, BIPOC folks have darker skin tones. Many people who are visibly different in this way from white people can experience negative reactions that are different from those who are Asian-American, and especially different from white Hispanic folks, many of whom can pass as white.\n\nSee my other reply about white Hispanic vs. indigenous Hispanic for another example of why noting BIPOC as a subgroup of POC can be valuable when it comes to explaining the varying experiences of POC.",

I'm not speaking to their content, just that I've *literally* heard the term used on there often.\n\nDifferent creators use the term BIPOC, both white people and those that fall under the BIPOC umbrella. In fact, almost every non-white creator I follow uses the term, where applicable, in their videos. How does the videos being posted on TikTok invalidate that? Are you saying that they aren't using that term? As topics #BIPOC has over 358 million views and #BIPOCTikTok has over 124 million views. If they're using the term shouldn't we follow their lead?\n\nI have no idea where BIPOC originated from but as that's the community I hear/see using it the most I'll respect their wishes.",

Do you think those Mexicans living in East Austin wanted their grandkids to grow up in a gang infested hood? Don't you think they saw the opportunity to move to a place with better schools, less crime, and more opportunity for their family as a good thing. \n\nStop treating us Hispanics like we're zoo animals that white people need to keep in a ghetto zoo so that they can feel good about living in a \"multi-cultural\" area. We want good schools, safe neighborhoods, good paying jobs, and opportunity - just like everyone else. \n\nPoverty isn't romantic. Generational poverty isn't either.

This makes climbing the ladder of income harder than in other states. \n\nIf you are a millionaire, you don't care; You either hide the money, hire an army of accounts to \"invest it\", or you simply have your official residence elsewhere. \n\nIf you are poor, you don't care. The only tax you pay is a sales tax. And you get money back at the end of the year.\n\nIt's middle class families trying to climb the ladder who confront an unassailable wall of high costs, taxes, and fees. \n\nThe comparison I like to make is this:\n\nCalifornia has several key industries, like Hollywood, Silicon Valley, the farms of the Central Valley, endless forests for wood, and petroleum. It has both raw materials and talent combined with every type of weather you could want. \n\nMost of Texas is either desert or ranches. The major cities all form a triangle in a section in the far east of the state. It has plenty of oil, a little farming, and a growing tech sector. The weather is either doom hot, frozen doom, or for a few months, fairly nice.\n\nIn short, California has advantages in weather, industry, access to materials, talent and everything else - and yet people move by the hundreds of thousands to Texas. \n\nWhy? Because the roadblocks to success aren't as big. The cost of living is lower, access to good schools is easier, and there is a lot to do. As a middle class family, you can make it in Texas, and then move wherever you want. It is the land of opportunity.\n\nYou can not say the same of California.",

I conned the robber into providing them. Then they arrested a serial Subway robber like two weeks later. The guy had hit something like 6 or 7 Subways throughout the Phoenix metro area. So your saying you already knew there was a guy robbing Subway restaurants all over the city, had video of those crimes, discounted the fact that I intentionally got you his prints with video proof of that and still thought it might be the 19 year old with no car?

No the people of most Islamic states view the laws very positively by and large. For example 84% of Muslims in Palestinian are in favor of stoning as the punishment for adultery. For another example 86% of Muslims in Egypt are in favor of the death penalty for converting away from Islam.\n\nThis is very well documented. The Pew Research Center asks all these questions every few years.\n\n\nYou hear about shit in the USA so much because such a large chunk of the USA disagrees with what is happening / being discussed.",

Now look at these laws in certain USA states that are trying to use religion to control women? Doesn't seem that farfetched to compare the two nations. \nWe hear about shit in the USA because a lot of upsetting shit tends to come from this powerful allie of ours and its concerning as they tend to have a global influence.",

In Texas, children are charged with conduct in need of supervision or delinquent conduct rather than the actual defined criminal offense. This section is defining being a runaway as a criminal offense, not as a cover to not do your job.",

It's cheap to attract people. That's what happens in places that are trying to get people to move in. It's called capitalism. Cheap generally means it's not in high demand.\n\nLots of jobs? Sure because gentrification made everywhere else so expensive so now they're even developing shitty barren land. Capitalism. Once the good spots are too expensive, it makes sense to move where it's not so good, but cheaper. The loss in possible revenue from being in a less than prime spot is now more than made up for with how cheap it is because no one wanted it yet.\n\nEndless growth won't last forever. It's power problems are going to get worse and worse.\n\nThey're building a deck of cards and playing fast and loose.\n\nIt's gonna crash at some point.

You're simply shoving the information you hear into your belief.\n\nTons of people move to California too.\n\nLarge states get lots of people. It fucking happens. Especially when you start overpopulating area, they start to go to where there's land that isn't doing shit, so they can build more housing.\n\nTexas is fucking empty. Most of its population doesn't even cover nearly half it's land.\n\nBut this information doesn't fit into your narrative.\n\nPeople move for a variety of reasons.\n\nIt is not proof it's the best state in the country.\n\nFuck.",

And it\u2019s really the major ones seeing as how pretty much 3/4ths of the population in major cities is in democratic controlled cities. Maybe that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t want to provide a link.\n\nI did a quick cursory look into trafficking statistics, and you\u2019d know that it\u2019s a contentious topic either way. Nothing really lines it up, and you trying to shut the conversation down is pathetic to say the least. You can\u2019t pull facts out to save your life, that\u2019s why you try to deflect and turn away from it.\n\nHuman trafficking is one number, sex trafficking is another and it\u2019s a hard one to nail down because it\u2019s murky waters when it comes to prostitution and whether it\u2019s trafficking or not (that being ONE of many things that comes up when looking at the numbers, most studies are done as estimates so we don\u2019t know).\n\nWhen it comes down to it, it\u2019s a problem for sure. But bringing it down as party politics is a dirty lie. It\u2019s a bigger problem in a bigger market (bigger cities) and the top ten google results don\u2019t even break it down all that well. You saying it\u2019s \u201cextremely easy to look up\u201d yet it didn\u2019t seem to be so it should be trivial for you to link out to them.

If you're close to majority it might be long enough till they catch up with you that you're not a minor any more and they can pound sand while you enjoy your new life in NotRedState. \n\nIt sure would be convenient if you could plan your getaway around something like a major sporting event, so you can plan for months in advance and quite possibly be on a plane and fucking gone  within hours. No need for accomplices, you can probably Uber your way out of there in minutes. If this teen had a job, with money? Shit. \n\nIt's not like there's no possible way this isn't what's going down. It's Texas. When things go full *Handmaid's Tale* it starts there. We know this. I'd fucking flee too. \n\nMaybe this theory wouldn't make any sense if I knew more details, maybe the kid's only 13 and that's different, but no matter what I can see why the cops start from the runaway situation first, instead of jumping straight to kidnapping. They're kind of the same investigation, honestly. You're finding out where this kid went, the only question is how. \n\nBut, you know, Reddit's hivemind narrative.",
