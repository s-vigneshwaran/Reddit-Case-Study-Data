  "text": "TIFU by taking a job beyond my capabilities and I owe over $4k\nMechanic here, I mostly work on older vehicles like early 2000's and older. I was working on a 2013 grand caravan to replace a timing chain guide and everything was going good until I tried to start it. Well, the timing was slightly off and I didn't know the sensors for the valve train had to be reset. Well, I got it put together and tried starting. No start. Gave it back to the customer on a tow truck and told them to take it to a different shop. Bent valves, off time and messed up cylinder heads is the damage. I didn't take any payment and I told them that I would cover the cost of any repairs as any honest mechanic should, but I didn't realize the extent of the damage and now I have to make it right and pay $4,138 to get it fixed properly from a different shop. Thankfully the customer was civil about it and will hopefully not put any bad on my name, but yeah, I messed up and now I have to pay for my mess up. \n\nTL;DR TIFU And took on a job I couldn't do so now I have to pay someone else to fix my mess up.",

I've only fired people for fucking up when they've tried to cover it up and pretend they didn't (which usually ends with much worse results then if they'd just admitted it right away). In a previous job, the most likely mistake staff could make was a medication error, either giving someone the wrong dose or giving them someone else's meds. I spent so much time in training emphasizing that everyone is going to make a med error at some point, and when you do as long as you notify people right away you'll be fine. And still the majority of the time people would try to alter the med counts or throw away extra pills or dilute solutions to try to cover it up. Tell someone immediately and if it's life threatening we can fix it before any severe damage is done (most of the time). Try to hide it and there's a negative reaction and the doctors have no idea why, and you just killed someone. And yet, somehow, most people still choose to risk someone's life then admit a simple, completely understandable mistake. They'd rather face negligent homicide charges then say \"hey, I fucked up\" and hear \"thanks for letting me know, let's do what we can to fix it.\"",

At least for us, I imagine somewhere that deals with cancer meds or hospice meds would be much more dangerous. We weren't lackadaisical or anything about it, and repeat offenders didn't last long. The key was that if you told someone immediately, the odds of adverse effects were decreased massively. So we had to balance strict enough discipline that staff did everything they could do avoid it, with lenient enough punishment that they wouldn't feel inclined to try to cover it up. Where that fails is that the default human position is to never admit a mistake.\n\nThis is completely anecdotal and I don't have anything peer reviewed (that I know of) to confirm it, but from what I've seen people with \"cushy\" BA degrees are much more likely to admit a mistake, while people with \"hard science\" BS degrees are much more likely to cover it up. My completely untrained guess is that \"softer\" fields instill a mindset that redoing something a hundred times (painting over a finished painting, editing and reediting a script or a novel over and over and over), encourage a mindset that \"hard\" science strives for at it's best: if something doesn't fit as it should, then change it. However, in undergrad studies, only well established \"this is the only way to find a correct answer and if you deviate at all you are wrong\" are taught for \"hard\" sciences. That's not to knock hard science, if anything it's because it's done such an amazing job that we've advanced so far in those fields, to get enough understanding to see where the unknowns are requires doctoral level education. But I'm so far off topic now that all of this is just meds-have-worn-off ADHD ramblings.",

The 1/1000 time that you mess something up, your boss and maybe your coworkers see it who've also seen you have a stellar record of doing it perfectly the vast majority of the time. The mistake is fixed and in the king run no one even notices it. People with those jobs forget that in a service job, 1/1000 fuck ups on the provider's side of usually 25-100% fuck ups from their (the customers) side.\n\nIf everyone abandoned their entire career and started a new field from scratch every time they made a mistake then everyone would be absolutely horrible at whatever they're doing. Admit your mistake, do what you can to make it right, and learn from it so you don't make the same mistake again. Based on this post, I'd be way more likely to trust op with my vehicle then a random mechanic I knew nothing about. I know that they'll now very readily realize and admit when a certain job might require different expertise, and know that when it fits their expertise they'll excel at it. No one knows what they don't know until they know they don't know it. Learning what you don't know makes you better, not worse.",

The best thing you can do is continue to model that process for her and reassure her that it's a totally normal, human thing to make mistakes.   \n\nIf I make a mistake while teaching, I'll stop, acknowledge my mistake out loud, apologize to the class/to the student, and correct it/say what I will do in the future to prevent it. Sometimes, that process happens after the fact once I've gotten a chance to calm down and think about a situation that I should have handled differently.\n\nYou can also teach her some calm down techniques to help her break that frustration cycle. Practice these with her before she does anything that could cause her to get into that cycle. \n\nOne thing I've found particularly helpful for my kids this year (9-11-year-olds) is to take 2-3 minute breaks when they feel themselves getting to that point. During the break, they can go get water, use a fidget, pace at the back of the room, take some deep breaths, doodle, or whatever else helps get them recentered. When the timer is up, they try again. For some of my kids who don't have strong emotional regulation skills, this takes a few different cycles, but as long as they aren't distracting others or using it to get out of work, I don't have an issue with that. We all have to start somewhere.",

The idea is that risk is adjusted such that the premiums each insurer receives across all accounts (not just the one that makes the claim) cover the odd individual that makes a claim plus allowing room for profit.\n\nThey still need a sizable pool to cover a worst-case scenario but they have math wizards that determine how much it should be based on guaranteed premiums, sub-insurance, likelihood of that scenario, and dollar-amount caps on claims. \n\nIt's all a racket anyway.

Most insurance companies make their money in two ways - underwriting income (money in minus money paid to claims) and return on investments.  Usually you pay for you policy for a whole year - the insurance company technically hasnt earned that money until the end of the year.  So they invest a good chunk of it.  MOST of an insurance companys profits come fro  investments not underwriting income. \n\n\nIn a bad year some companies even LOSE money on underwriting - eg they pay out more claims than they took in in premiums, but still make money on the invested premiums.   I know the company i used to work for ran at about a 98% loss ratio.  You can make it better than that by diversifying products, locations, types of business etc.  For example maybe you lose money on auto but commercial you make big money. \n\n\n\nA lot of people call insurance a scam because you dont realize the value of your policy until youve had a claim.  I worked in claims and can say I paid out waaaay more claims than i ever denied.  Most of the time it was people who wanted stuff covered that explicitly wasnt covered - eg contents stolen from a vehicle or things like neighbouritis - my neighbour got a new roof from hail damage so i want one too! I guess it depends on the company though.",

After a *month* of trying to get the case adjuster on the phone, the adjuster called me and said \"our driver claims she was behind the stop sign and you drifted over and hit her.\"\n\nI was thinking \"No, she didn't. YOU might be claiming that, but I bet money those words never left her lips.\" The lady was nice as could be and tripping over herself apologizing, even admitted fault to the responding police officer at the scene. I responded that the photos I took of the scene would belie that claim, considering the location of my skid marks and the fact that I'd have had to break through over 6m of steel guardrail, that was still perfectly intact, to be *able* to hit her if she were stopped at the stop sign. I emailed the photos and they sent my check the next day.\n\nIt was only $6500. A '96 Nissan Maxima with a quarter million miles on it in 2011.

Unless you lose your phone in the first few months, new phones will have come out and replacement costs on your phone go way down.\n\nWhat if you bought a 128gb iphone 11 18 months ago.  You paid $220 for full applecare+.  Say you lose your phone tomorrow (broken screens aren't that expensive to fix, so lets say worst case scenario and hte phone is just gone).  You pay another $150 deductible (I think? Some articles say it might be 200+).\n\nSo now you're at $370.  I can find refurbished units on ebay for about $450.  So at most, the insurance is really saving you 450-370=$80.  \n\nBut that's not even true.  You said you've been through 5 phones.  Say your loss happens on the 5th phone (and assume the apple care prices are the same).  You''d have paid 5*220 =  1100 in Applecare+ costs, plus 150 in deductibles, for a total of 1250...and all you are getting for that is a replacement iphone 11 that's only worth about 450.\n\nApplecare is a HUGE profit center for apple.  And that's even after adjusting for the moral hazard fact that people who are clumsy/careless and know they are more likely to break/lose their phones are the people who are also more likely to buy the insurance.",

First off the apple care you got on phone #1 has nothing to do with phone #2 and same for 3 and so on. You didn\u2019t spend money on phone 1 to protect phone 5 so adding them up is somewhat misleading. Second if you get a new phone you can refund remaining month of apple care so say you paid $200 for it then 8 months later you got a new iPhone. You call apple and tell them you want to cancel the apple care on the old phone and they\u2019ll refund you the remaining 16 months. Obviously a lot of people don\u2019t do that but they should. \n\nIf you replace your phone so frequently you should just be paying the monthly apple care fee instead of buying 2 years straight if you want apple care. \n\nAgain though what you paid 5 years ago had nothing to do with what you\u2019re paying now. Someone who gets the new iPhone every year and apple care who loses their phone doesn\u2019t have to spend 1000 on a new phone. The old iPhone\u2019s value is entirely irrelevant to the current ones. You paid for that old ones apple care when it was a high value item to protect it when it was a high value item not to replace it years later when it\u2019s worth less. \n\nReally the value isn\u2019t that bad to protect a new device for the first and possibly second year that the device is actually worth money. And that\u2019s what it is an assurance that you don\u2019t have to buy a new device if something goes wrong in that first year of ownership. Apple care only lasts 2 years as it is so I\u2019m not sure why we are even talking about the value of phones way past their relevance.\n\nHowever yes insurance is a huge profit maker and that gives it a bad look. What\u2019s worse is how often insurance companies do whatever they can to deny a claim which makes them look even worse. It looks bad right away because most people shouldn\u2019t need to file a claim. It\u2019s a protection that should go unneeded. Usually \u201cinsurance\u201d and extended warranty services though aren\u2019t bad about claim denying. When you pay for it at say Best Buy and actually need to use it you don\u2019t even have to pay a deductible. You just walk in and replace the device free of charge. If you never need it you feel ripped off. If you replace a $500-$2000 tv for an upfront cost of $200 though it feels pretty damn worth.",

Point is, failure to reset the cam sensor doesn't cause the issues described.\n\n4) OP clearly says \"the timing was slightly off\", and confirms \"off time\" is part of the final damage. That's the main problem here. They changed timing while working, and failed to verify it before cranking.\n\nIn other words, this was caused by not knowing how to do timing work.",

I put the timing belt on one time off by a couple of teeth. I had very low power but didn't hurt anything.\n\nWhat's more likely is that the timing chain guide wasn't installed correctly or failed.\n\nHere's the weird thing - how many mechanics that you know, would have a no-start after doing timing belt work, and **not take it apart to see what was wrong**? It makes absolutely no sense that OP would just throw it on a flatbed and ship it out to someone else.

If you are the type of person who has three claims a year or loves to get pulled over for speeding than yeah you should be charged more. But no reason for someone that has 10 years of no driving history or claims to be getting rate increases every year.",

You are right Reddit is very left leaning but that doesn't mean proper argumentation is ignored, in fact it's praised because we are in such short supply of it. Remember \"assholes exist but if everyone is an asshole it's more likely you are actually the asshole\". If you really feel this way it's telling that you keep trying to argue instead of just accepting that your viewpoint won't be accepted. That's willful ignorance and stubbornness and does make you look as if you are arguing simply to argue. Your lack of self awareness to this fact doesn't change that but does it feel good getting angry at people in the comments? I just feel like you are doing yourself a disservice by repeatedly trying to force your viewpoint on those you know will disagree.",

They have a number cruncher look at the details and calculate how likely it is that X will happen over the length of the policy, and how much it will cost if it does.  They take that info and come up with an \"expected value\", tack on a percentage for profit margin, and then divide that cost out over the length of the policy to determine your monthly payment.\n\nIf a business has a history of filing costly claims, the number crunchers use that and determine that X is more likely to happen, and so the next time they calculate the premiums it'll be higher.  If the premiums for a mechanic who filed claims constantly were the same as a mechanic who never filed any claims, then EVERYONE'S rates would be higher to subsidize the guy who keeps making mistakes.  This isn't a scam, it's just how insurance works.",

Didn\u2019t realize bills nor food needed to be met. Wow you should run for congress. Get out of here with that logic. Oh better yet, how about hospitals? Shouldn\u2019t they be nonprofit and do it out of the goodness of their hearts? It\u2019s not like anyone has to eat or has bills to pay. Every time I hear some sort of insurance is a scam comment, I just think how dim witted they must be. So if someone gets into an accident that causes millions worth of damages or better yet let\u2019s just say thousands, if an insurance company had no reserves and it was non profit, how would they pay for it?",

I didn\u2019t plan on getting a new bumper for the few scrapes it had so the $200 \u201cextra\u201d money was helpful, especially since I was between jobs and about to graduate college. I was so thankful for that money that I went to the mechanic and declined the $500 they would have had to pay me. It was a rural area and I don\u2019t think the shop had more than 2 or 3 employees.

Start at TDC on #1 , check timing gear alignment marks, rotate engine two full turns, check alignment marks again.\n\nI did the timing belt driven water pump on my son's car a few weeks ago. The exhaust camshaft was one belt tooth out when I first set it to TDC before I even took the belt off, and I was working without a manual. I reset it when I put the belt back on and wound that thing over by hand about 6 times before I was confident enough to crank it over with the key.\n\nAaaaand then there was a god-awful noise when I started it. Turned out the timing cover was rubbing on the water pump pulley where I couldn't see it (east-west motor and not much room). I nearly had a heart attack, but 15 minutes of careful poking and prodding and readjusting of covers fixed it.\n\nOne day later, there's a video on Instagram of some guy adjusting the timing belt tension on the *exact same model* Daewoo engine that's 17 years old. I wish their algorithms had shown that to me before I had started, there was a fair bit of head-scratching when I was trying to get the tension right.\n\nWith regards to engines with variable cam timing..... yeah I'd really like to have a good look at the repair manual before starting on one of those.",

I've only put hand power into a crankshaft once myself, just doing a valve clearance service. My concern from that experience is that there's still so much resistance from the engine itself that you'd probably still slightly bend the valves before things really jam up and you realise how much trouble you're in. Unless this was an engine I really knew the feel of, I don't think I'd notice the slightly increased resistance of a valve in the way.\n\nIs that the case or am I just paranoid? Either way, it would certainly do less damage overall, but you'd still be in a little trouble, no?",

We'll after 6 months they drive it to my driveway smoke bellowing out of the hood, none if the electronics working, a mess of a job.  I tell them to fix it right and another 6 months go by and finally just pick the thing up myself.  They did really good work up until they encountered sensors, rewiring, and newer engine components tech.  Shit was ducktaped and epoxied... fucking mess.  Lossed two long term friends that day.  Cost me thousands to bring to a reputable shop and at the end of the day no resale value since salvaged title.\n\nIf they were just honest, said its not going well or we don't know what we're doing, kept me up to date in the progress,  I could have fixed the situation.  But just strung me along for a year.",

There are always timing marks and link or tooth spacing. If something moves, it all has to be set to zero or known condition. It can never be disassembled without resetting re-setting to known or marking the locations so exact reassembly can be done. Some engines even have marks on the block or head to help out with cam position, and some chains and belts have marks to match.",

If you can turn a wrench, it\u2019s no more difficult than any other job on most cars. The fuck up here isn\u2019t that the job was beyond your capabilities. The fuck up was your arrogance.",

Granted, most of my experience comes from small performance oriented motors, but other than a 2 or 3 cylinder motor, everything with an overhead cam system going to need to be timed pretty carefully so it doesn't slip out of time as you put on the new belt or chain. To do that level of damage, either it was off by 3+ teeth or flipped 180. And if you, as a mechanic, couldn't hear the rattle trap going on as you cranked the motor, you are either deaf or, again, need to be in a different line of work.",

If the timing is let's say 2-3 teeth off, could the advancement or retardation of the cam by the variable valve system cause a valve to meet the piston? \n\nObviously an experienced mechanic would notice a lack of resistance or compression when turning the engine over, but that's not really as simple as \"just turn it over by hand first\".\n\nOn second thought, does the ecu/pcm check to see if there is a correct cam/crank correlation before engaging the system? I think this could very well be the case. Which would mean it is as simple as \"just turn it over by hand first\".

Apparently he drove it with a leaky line for a bit and got air in the whole system, including the ABS module. I tried to bleed it in the driveway for three days using one floor jack and jack stand.

Her boss played a lot of golf and left her to decide how to deal with most of it. I had two friends who worked at a local Nissan dealer as a service writer and the other at a local GM dealer. Whatever I told them had happened, they'd done it themselves or one of their friends had. One of my wife company's mechanics took a brand new very hard to get high performance car, it arrived with them needing a brake recall before it could be handed over, rerouting a sensor wire of something. It was a cold day so they had the shop doors closed. Our hero completed the brake work, which had included dismounting the brake calipers. He fired up the beast and accelerated towards the door while hitting the opener. He hit the brakes and his foot went to the floor. He hadn't pumped them up. He put the car straight through the almost closed door. Right through the heavy bar across the bottom. Door and car were ruined. They found another one at another local dealer and begged them for it, eventually cut a deal involving selling something below cost to them and finding them a replacement which could be there in a week. Customer turned up the next day and the car new new car was ready. Behind the scenes they lost a bunch of money on the repairs, then selling the 'used' car after running it as a demo for a while. When I'd finished telling the lads they had an array of similar stories. Dropped cars off lifts, driven into pits, crashed on road tests, grabbed the wrong gear (only disabled people drive automatics in the UK) and blown apart a bell housing, or trashed an engine. So what I learned no matter how bad you think you fucked up, someone else already did it.",

I did them manually because I needed to move it out of the way till I could do it. Had pedal and figured it was ok to move across the parking lot. Put it in reverse and pedal went to the floor. Clipped another car in the panic. Didn't damage the one I hit but the one I was in crumpled back quarter panel and trunk.  Ended up being about 7k in damage. It all happened quick and I couldn't get the e brake, tried to just throw it in park. Hardest part was calling to tell them what happened. I still feel terrible about it. He had money and didn't seem too upset. My insurance covered all but 1k and it got fixed and he traded it in.",

Next time I went to start my car there was a loud bang and then nothing. The belt they had just replaced was now loose. Dealership did they'd take a look and make sure nothing else was damaged once it was back in their shop. Come to find out, the tensioner broke. No biggie, fixed and back on the road. Then a few days later, things were running really rough so I had them look again. There was suddenly a hole in my transmission. Their guess was a bolt got lost from something and lodged in there. They said it was most likely from having someone work on my engine and asked who had worked on it recently. I told them they were and the last shop that had was month prior for an oil change. Blank stares and then some spiel about there's no way it came from their work etc and I had to pay for Partially new transmission, which was about $3,000 and due to covid, I was only getting about $200 a month.\n\nI hope you benefit from this long term, because I have yet to go back or even recommend anyone go back there.

They also tore out the entire back end interior paneling because they were, I guess, concerned about the wire for the towing hitch?? They replaced the engine with some shitty junkyard engine that I have no idea how many miles it had and lost working A/C too. I'm assuming they left the old compressor on when they did the swap because that also worked previously.\n\nFuck me for being young, poof, and having to have a vehicle so I had to buy from Carhop.\n\nI started to leave with the key and then snapped. I *drove* the vehicle in to the shop. If it didn't start, that was their problem to figure out. The transmission also leaks/leaked about a quart per 100 miles, they refused to fix that despite it being covered, so the whole thing was for absolutely nothing. It's just a giant paperweight.",

I'm not an ASE certified mechanic, I just work on my own cars because I enjoy it and I work on my friends cars because it saves them money. I don't buy a Haynes manual for every car I touch. I don't Google torque specs for every bolt I tighten (only for engine internals). Most cars work pretty similarly so it's oddball issues like OP ran into that get you. These armchair \"mechanics\" don't have any idea what I'm talking about because they haven't touched their Harbor Freight 300-Piece Mechanics Tool Kit in the last year or have only ever worked on one single car and couldn't point out the timing chain (well, timing cover I suppose) on a 2013 dodge.",

So I immediately knew the F up and shame on me for not being more involved to help him make sure everything was correct.\n\nTook it back apart and found the timing was 180\u00b0 off, bent all 8 exhaust valves. Sent it back off to get repaired, got it back together and all three of us double and triple checked every little detail, turned it by hand to check some more, then started it and it fired right up.\n\nWasted a combined ~12 hours of labor and almost $400 in valve repairs, obviously didn't charge the customer for any of it and I wasn't going to make our guy pay it either. So the company lost some money and time, and a valuable lesson was learned that week. If he does it again that may be a different story, but I'm a strong believer that accidents happen and shouldn't always be punished. I'm pretty sure he learned his lesson either way.",

I get it road legal, then immediately start investigating getting the chain replaced. Asked my Dad \"No need, don't mess with it until there's a problem.\" Brought it to my mechanic. \"No need, they make a lot of noise first.\"  To a third friend who's a mechanic \"Naww, it'll be good for awhile, don't even worry about it\"\n\nTwo weeks later, not even 100 miles later, driving home, engine revs then nothing. Have it towed. I guess technically they were all correct - the chain was intact. However, that year they started using nylon teeth to make it quieter - those stripped and instead of a $400 maintenance job I had a new engine job instead. There were a lot of electrical problems after that too - think a few wires must have gotten kinked in the process and was constantly trying to track down strange electrical issues. Should have trusted my gut.\n\nAnyway, I feel you! We all pay a fuckup tax from time to time. Good on you for making it right.",

Sprockets are keyed to only fit the camshaft in one position, and the sprockets are visibly different for inlet and exhaust. The sprockets have timing marks, as does the timing cover. Easy.\n\nMy newer 1.6 Ti-VCT Ford from 2012 is DOHC and also uses a timing belt, but it has cam phasers on both camshafts. You have to not only correctly set the position of the crank (using a special pin) but you also have to set the position of the cams themselves (with another special tool) and *then* correctly set the position of both cam phasers (with yet another special tool). These special tools can only be used on like 2 or 3 different engines, as they're *very* specific and not a general use tool.\n\nThe former needed to be changed every 6 years or so, and I always did it myself. The latter needs to be done every 10 years, and I had someone else do it before I collected the car after purchasing it. The car will likely be scrap or not worth the expense by the time it needs to be done next time.",

This was in a time where printers were not disposable and there were dedicated printer repair people.  I was not one of them.  I was in IT, but I in no way specialized in printers aside from being able to install and deploy them to users.  Certainly not repairing them.  I argued this point, but I was sent onsite anyway and told \"do your best\".\n\nI managed to find a massively huge manual for this beast online including how to disassemble it.  I did not have the correct tools for this, I had a philips head screwdriver.\n\nI managed to get the entire thing apart, put it back together, and it still didn't print, and still made a horrible grinding noise when printing.  Customer was like \"WTF you have been here for like 6 hours\" I said \"Yeah, sorry, I'm not actually at all qualified to be here but the guy who would normally do this is not available today so they sent me\". \n\nMy boss understood and apologized to me and the customer.  My company owner threatened to fire me over it.  I told him I've have him in court in half a heartbeat for unemployment along with the emails where I said I am not qualified to do this and have no idea what I'm doing, along with a follow-up that told me to just do my best.\n\nHe didn't fire me, but I did end up leaving about 6 months later.  Super shitty place to work, but I needed the experience.  About 3 years after I left the owner got arrested by the FBI and spent several years in prison and paid several million in fines.  He was buying VoIP phones directly from China without going through US distributors and reselling them in the US.  Highly illegal, he was making money hand over fist and it finally caught up with him.\n\nAlso answered the question as to why all of our warehouse deliveries and shipments happened at 2am.  I thought we maybe had 1-2 pallets of VoIP phones at a time, turns out (via others who were there late at night), that there were often up to 100 pallets of phones going in any out in any given night.",

Wouldn't it be cheaper on your end to buy the engine and swap it out --- saving you 2k?  I know you'll be out the labor but you can save yourself a few bucks while still providing an entire engine under warranty to the customer for piece of mind.  I always give at least a year warranty with parts and labor on any job we do.  \n\n\\*\\*\\*BTW you said you ate the original job because you didn't finish/it got fcked up.  But if you swapped the engine and left everything satisfactory with the customer, couldn't you also ask them to pay the original bill?  Like I said I would do the timing for let's say 1k and the engine costs you 1500 --- you'd lose all the labor and a few bucks but way less than 4k.\n\nAt the end of the day it all depends on the customer and how they feel --- I've been in your shoes and I've paid for everything to be done elsewhere and I've also replaced engines on the house using my guys and my time if the customer is cool with us un-fucking the situation.  I AM ALSO A SIMPLE MOM AND POP SHOP.  The reason I mention asking the customer to cover the original bill IF THE CUSTOMER SEES FIT AND AGREES is simply because shit, at the end of the day that's a hit that could break me.  I started off small and some months I could barely get by.",

On these newer cars that require special tools to hold cams in place etc. I'd pass on. Sound like you are a small operation (that's awesome, keep working for yourself), I would invest some $$ into alldatapro. It's great with R&R procedures and a list of tools needed (for most jobs). Looking through this before taking on a job has saved me so much headache. This particular era porche needs this particular specialty tool for timing work? Sorry we don't have that equipment. Objectively Idenifix is better, but I find it so much faster to look things up on alldatapro. \n\nGood on you for keeping a good and honest reputation. I guarantee it will pay off in the end. Once your reputation is out there, people will come to you for that, regardless of cost. I have had customers spend $500+ more (labor cost) for us to do a job than the cheaper place down the street. The only reason is because they want to know they are being treated right and you aren't screwing them over. Once your customer base is there for your honesty, work gets really easy. At least, that's how it worked out for me.",

      "text": "Could be worse. My friend told me about the time he had his Honda in for repairs at a small dealer. The mechanic showed him an engine they had on the bench for major repairs. The mechanic says \"look how little friction there is - you can turn the engine by hand\" since the timing chain was off, and turns the crankshaft a few turns.  However, this resulted in the mechanic learning the engine was zero-clearance and he'd dinged and bent a couple of the valves - remove head and re-do some valves. \n\nI took our Audi A4 to a non-dealer mechanic for a timing belt replacement, and even though he had the tool from the dealer to set the timing, the timing was off and the engine chugged when approaching highway speeds. He redid the timing and fixed it, but I suspect during all this major work he had not completely refilled the oil - the V6 engine died a few months later. After an oil flush, and we were never sure if it was the classic clogged oil pump screen (for the first few years they had not used synthetic oil, their excuse factory spec did not say to, and we drove very fast for extended periods)  or whether the engine overheated from lack of oil - but after the flush, the oil light came on whenever you backed off the accelerator.  The oil flow was too fast for the pump.  A new engine cost more than the car was worth.",

Not trying to bash you, we perform hard dirty cramped work and it's only getting tougher. I've been doing this for a long time, my first go to... is always TSB's and read the procedures on repairs. I chose this trade cause I hated school...surprise!! I spent my entire career going to update trainings/night school and certifications/license tests.

They're generally seen as \"life of the engine\" type deal.\n\nAs a separate thought online the same topic;\n\nHave you see anything about the \"wet belt\" cam drive that Ford use in the 1.0T 3 cylinder EcoBoost? That's a wild design.\n\nIt's literally the worst of both worlds, with the only benefit being reduced frictional losses for increased fuel mileage.\n\nThe belt is internal to the engine and runs in oil, but apparently the belts like to perish and disintegrate, which either clogs the oil pickup or the belt snaps and trashes the valves.\n\nAnd because they use a keyless crank, you need some beefy AF torque multiplier to do the crank pulley bolt. Apparently it's like 16 hours of labour to change the belt + about \u00a31000 in special tools!\n\nGonna be a lot of 10 year old Fiestas out there in 2023 that aren't having their belts changed!",
