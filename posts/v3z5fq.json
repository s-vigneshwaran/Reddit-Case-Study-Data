Hell, even if they tell a story about the water crisis in the west and interview a climatologist or water expert and mention climate change. \n\nI've actually gotten mad at NPR when they bring on a talking thumb of some republican thinktank, or legislative slackjaw and let them spout their conspiracy ridden nonsense, or worse, their marketing spin and don't press them in an interview. Because several times they've gone soft on those thumbs, then have a follow up by a progressive voice and absolutely grill them on facts. \n\nIf you watch or listen to right wing media, it's astounding how narrow the topics are. The actual reporting is maybe one statement of \"this happened\" then the rest is intentionally designed to rile their audience up by poking at their sympathetic nervous system. The result is that there's actually very few topics that you can converse on, and any other media source is automatically invalidated because any topics outside of their bubble are \"liberal propaganda\". \n\nI really struggle with how to handle not only misinformation, but media masquerading as news. I guess you could call it \"trigger news\"? Where the whole point is to spin, obfuscate, omit, lie, enrage, terrify, induce anxiety, and create \"others\". It's clear that humans are not equipped to deal with synthetic emotional pumps like Fox or NewsMax, and it makes me wonder how to regulate that shit.",

Even during the time period you mentioned, the US previously used 30.06 during WW2, which makes .223 look like a kids toy.  The advantage of the AR platform and similar models was that the ammo is smaller/lighter and the gun is lighter as well, making it easier to carry for long distances, while still being effective on as an anti-personnel round.\n\nIf the claim is that \"rifle ammo does a lot of damage to human bodies\" then yes, that's true of pretty much all rifles/guns, because that is literally the point of them?  It's still ridiculous to make all these absurd claims about exploding bodies and decapitating adults, or to imply that if different rifles/guns were used on children that they'd possibly be able to overcome an armed attacker",

I pointed out the other rifle calibers to further illustrate how ridiculous that idea is after you made the claim that because a 50 year old document indicated that the rifles were useful in combat (as well made rifles tend to be) as a supporting statement for their article.\n\nThe AR's popularity in mass shootings is meaningless.

It's the equivalent of people noting that Jeep Cherokees are the most common \"vehicle of choice\" to drive people to mass shootings or to commit other crimes (they're simply the most commonly driven car found in America).\n\nHandguns are the \"weapon of choice\" for civilians that have stopped and/or prevented mass shootings from becoming mass shootings, though ARs have been used as well.

You asked if based on that attempt at irrelevant shock tactics the reality of the situation (and therefore my position) would change. So I then pointed out that being killed with any of those other things would also easily result in being unidentifiable if they were used to heavily damage the face (and they very easily could be). Just as if a car drove over someone\u2019s head they would be unrecognizable.  It seems I\u2019m your haste to reply you forgot what your original point was, and therefore didn\u2019t understand the arguments pointing out why it made no sense?  \n\nAs for proficient shooters being able to stop multiple attackers, that\u2019s true for any gun.  Which is also exactly they work so well in defense as well, and why claiming they should be heavily restricted harms far more non-criminals than criminals.  5 muscular 200lb criminal men would have to fear a 100lb woman with a gun, because even if they all rushed her at once, she would have the distinct advantage, as opposed to being essentially a helpless victim otherwise if both she and they were unarmed. \n\nAs for all the legislation/restrictions you proposed, none of the safety measures in cars prevent them from doing what they\u2019re supposed to do.  The rate of accidental deaths from guns is already extremely low, so I\u2019m not sure what kind of built in safety measures you believe would make sense on guns (other than the ones already in place)? \n\nAlso, licensing requirements again do literally nothing to reduce crime. Leaving aside the fact that criminals already ignore such requirements, do you really think there is any situation where a murderer would go \u201chmm I was going to go out and murder a bunch of people with this gun in my possession, but I don\u2019t want to have my license taken away\u201d and/or I don\u2019t want my insurance premiums to go up?  That\u2019s just not realistic.  Additionally gun insurance would generally only protect you against theft or fees if you were wrongfully sued.  Insurance doesn\u2019t cover illegal activity.  Just as if you go out and use your car to run over a bunch of pedestrians, your insurance doesn\u2019t pay you to repaint it, nor does it pay anything to your victims, because again, insurance doesn\u2019t cover illegal activity, so obtaining it again prevents a grand total of zero crimes",

People really do have a poor media digest... We often take our own thoughts as fact when we, by human nature, constantly lie to ourselves and misremember key parts of even important events while over-estimating our knowledge and efficacy, so is it really so difficult to understand why the average person will take information as truth from questionable sources as long as it supports what they already believe?\n\nI make an effort to use sourcing as politically neutral as possible, but some people will straight up ignore established scientific research from respected journals. Still, it saves time when your original post or first response includes solid information to backup your viewpoint so if someone wants to argue on the internet you can let them go wild without feeling the need to respond. The information should speak for itself and we have to be okay when it doesn't because arguing with strangers on the Internet might be one of the biggest wastes of time that your average person engages in on a daily basis. I say that knowing this post comes dangerously close to that, but I can assure you that I probably won't respond if someone has an issue with it unless I find it reasonable and interesting. Now, if someone has real questions, I love having substantive discussions, but that's rarely reciprocated... Most people just want to be right.",

The whole point of Fox News was to prevent another loss of power like what occurred when Nixon was forced to resign. \n\nUnfortunately it\u2019s been quite effective in that regard as is demonstrated by the fact that, even 2+ years after the fact (he was committing crimes before and during his tenure in addition to after his loss), the obviously guilty, conman, former president and failed businessman who commit numerous crimes in the public eye and made no attempt to get pardoned for them (likely because part of the stipulation of a pardon is admitting wrongdoing and a listing of all crimes for which you are being pardoned and his narcissism won\u2019t let him admit to that) has yet to be charged with anything. And nothing has happened even though failing to prosecute him for those crimes presents a very real danger to our democracy as what\u2019s to stop the next guy if this bumbling idiot gets a pass despite the mountain of evidence of wrongdoing he left in his wake?\n\nIf Fox News has ever been about actual conservative journalism and not blatant propaganda it wouldn\u2019t\u2019ve turned into the monster that it is today. As an actual conservative journalism outlet would have just chosen to cover the stories and topics that are important or of interest to conservatives and presented current events from a conservative point of view. It would never have had to essentially state that you cannot trust the information on their **news network** to be factual in a legal defense against defamation.\n\nAlso:\nhttps://theweek.com/articles/880107/why-fox-news-created\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/nixon-didn-t-have-fox-news-will-make-all-difference-ncna999761",

Some people will work themselves to the bone, but not something complicated enough to merit high pay. That's all they're capable of, either mentally or physically, but it doesn't mean they work any less hard. We just don't value their output as lucratively and this has an effect down the line on their kids. Their kids are going to develop with less effective resources and opportunities through no fault of their own. They may not even get the chance to finish school before being forced to work a dead end job and setting back their own kids. They all work hard, generally, they never get a chance to stop working hard to pursue something that would better their lives.\n\nI have a degree and make six figures, but I also understand I'm incredibly privileged with advantages others will never have. If you asked if I worked hard for it, I'd probably laugh. Absolutely not, I coasted through and never pushed my potential. I got through on intelligence alone (millionaire father helps), imagine if I had actually tried. 12 years seemed too long when I was recommended to become an anesthesiologist, went with the engineering instead.\n\nSuccess is a terrible indicator of hard work. Some of us fail upwards.",

The thought of a supreme being existing outside of time and space, then one day thinking it's a good idea to create a universe and put a bunch of people in it, then send a bunch of them to hell all while telling them it's their fault, and while knowing all things past, present, and future, like it's some sort of sick game.. I guess it just doesn't make sense in my little brain. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to be religious.",

I would openly bash on gay people online because it was wrong according to the bible, same with abortion, same with all those issues on the economy, Medicare, etc. I considered myself a proud conservative. \n\nFast forward to present day me, all my values completely changed. I would be willing to pay a little more in taxes if it helps fund public medical services, public education, and homelessness. I think men shouldn't even get to vote on if women should have an abortion. I'd never vote against gay marriage, and there should definitely be stricter gun laws.\n\nI want to say that just breaking away from my family and meeting people who come from all walks of life really changed my perspective on the world and pushed me to change my views from conservative to moderate. I just wanted to mind my own business. Then January 6th happened, and from that day I went from moderate to progressive.",

I've come to learn that many of my opinions are flawed and would think twice before trying to vote something into law. When it comes to abortion though, that is something I have given thought to and would confidently vote in support of it.",

Working different jobs, I was even a contactor for this law firm where I was reviewing people's financial information. Unfortunately, most of the time when someone needs a lawyer, they are struggling because of some tragedy in their lives and that job really gave me compassion to learn that people aren't just lazy, they have legit bad things happen and should get a break.  \n\n\nI don't want to write my whole life story, but in short it was gradual over time and the biggest thing was just getting to meet, know and care for other people.",

Meanwhile, energy companies buried the truth about global warming, all large companies profit off slave or near-slave labor in other countries, they ~~bribe~~ lobby congress to erode tax law and regulations that keep them from abusing different systems,  etc\n\n>All those people you look up to like Pelosi are multi millionaires.\n\nYour first mistake is thinking we look up to democrat politicians",

              "text": "When I was in grad school, I read a journal article that explained the phenomena you\u2019re referring to (bibliographic info at the bottom).\n\nThe premise is that we think in schemas.  A schema is a mental structure that connects related concepts and ideas and creates a unified system for comprehending the world.  So, for example, your schema for \u201cRepublican\u201d might contain positive associations (polite and well spoken gentlemen like Reagan, Christianity, low taxes), it might contain negative associations (opposed to expanding minority rights, overly religious, cuts to social programs).  Your schema will depend on your political affiliation and opinions.\n\nWhen new information is obtained, you have to fit it into your schemata.  But sometimes, it doesn\u2019t fit.  For example, if your schema of \u201cRepublican\u201d contains \u201cpolite and well spoken\u201d, then Donald Trump has broken your system.  You cannot maintain cognitive dissonance, so you either reject the data or you rebuild your schema.  Rejecting the data is easier, and is the more common response.  This often requires downgrading the source of the data\u2019s reliability.\n\nThis is a study from the 70s, but it still shocks me how well it fits the battles we fight over truth in media.  For example, I distrust Fox News.  I have heard numerous claims from them that seemed suspect, and when I checked them against other sources, it became apparent that Fox was spreading misinformation.  So I rejected their claims and downgraded their reliability.  \n\nThis obviously results in cognitive distortions, though, and I suspect this is one of the major issues behind our political fracturing.  Because in my mind, Fox News is unreliable, but that doesn\u2019t mean that Fox News always lies.  In fact, I would guess most of what they say is reliable because they are trying to peddle an ideology and facts made from wholecloth are not a good way to win people over.  Unfortunately, our brains are not made for such nuance, and it is hard to remain open to a source that broke a schema with what turned out to be a lie.\n\nAnyhow, hope y\u2019all find this as interesting as I did (and still do).\n\n\nBibliography:\nAxelrod, Robert.  1973 \"Schema Theory: An information processing model of perception and cognition,\" The American Political Science Review. 67:4 (Dec. 1973) 1249-1266.",

[There are many small cities with higher murder rates; Chicago is 28 on this list](https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/murder-map-deadliest-u-s-cities/39/). \n\nAlso this conservative BS about \"strict gun control\" is also almost completely fabricated. Illinois doesn't have strict gun laws. To be frank...nowhere has strict gun laws. Any felon can buy a gun in any state without a background check in minutes, and they don't even need some shady connection, just a cell phone. So saying that literally anywhere has \"strict gun control\" is a joke.",

You're correct that just dividing the raw number by any number would result in the same rankings. The idea with per capita calculations is to compare places with disparate population sizes by looking at them on a like-for-like basis. In other words: x murders for every 100k people in the country.",

I am sure there is a study out there and I'm sure the numbers are skewing the overall dataset. It think it is unfortunately probably due to the result of low taxation, under funding and to some degree, racial segregation. I wonder about this because many, many Europeans now think the US is unsafe to visit, when in reality it is not (even in low socio-economic areas the chances off being murdered as a tourist will still be very low).",

Strictly speaking, I imagine that's false and it isn't literally every weekend, but I recall from Memorial Day stories that its at least true some weekends.\n\nSo I appreciate the accidental correction, and thankfully I didn't misremember so badly as to undermine my point, because the Texas Governor was still making a pretty specious claim comparing raw totals across different populations.",

It goes into averages and medians and expected values and such the same as any other event. Probably the most well-known book on this today is Nassim Taleb's *The Black Swan*. (and to be clear school shootings don't even count as black swans on Taleb's view anymore. Columbine perhaps did. But it has been almost 3 decades now of repeated events, so you have to expect them even if they are unlikely and cannot be predicted.)",

Even if we were to imagine a scenario in which crimes per capita were uniform across the board, cities would obviously have a higher amount of crime because there are more people there. If we were to assume that one in every hundred people is a violent criminal, then a city of 100,000 people would have 1,000 violent criminals and a town of 400 people would have 4. The amount in the small town is significantly lower but the amount per capita is the same; the only reason the city has more criminals is because it has far more people in the first place.",

This is true, but it works both ways. The town of 1 million people is likely mostly safe basically all the time, but with pockets of violence in certain areas. Not always bad neighborhoods, but crimes tend to occur in pockets. Sometimes all the same place, sometimes specific crimes in specific areas. This is for a bunch of complex reasons, but the point you're trying to get at is if you took the crime rate of JUST that pocket, it would be very high. That specific place would be dangerous. The greater city itself, not so much. (I could be wrong, if this isn't what you were building toward let me know.)\n\nThe problem is that small towns have this issue as well. Not only that, but crime rates in small towns are deceptive in the opposite direction as the one you seem to think sometimes. Because it's a small town, and everyone knows everyone, lots of crimes might go unreported or under reported. Domestic assaults are under reported. Someone getting into a bar fight gets taken to sleep it off instead of charged because \"Thats just Hank. He's a poor drunk, but great guy really!\" \n\nSource: I grew up in a small town, now live in a major metro. Small isn't safer.",

Yes. Going back to my original point that per Capita only works if you're talking about the trend. A town of 10k that averages 1 murder a year does have functionally 10 times the murder rate of a town of 100k with 1 murder a year. Not only is that true, it's actually worse for the small town because the chance that you're directly affected in the small town is also higher. Violent crimes in small town have a higher impact. In a large city that impact is insulated. \n\nThe second way you're is this idea of sample size. Big cities actually suffer from the sample size problem because there are less big cities. If you say, \"the average is town of 10k-20k people has less than one murder\" you're again using statistics to paint a picture of the relative safety of small towns that isn't really accurate. Every town that has had no murders ever is lowering the data for every other town in the group. Cities of 1 million plus residents on the other hand are relatively few in number, so while relatively murder free large cities might help, there are no actually murder free cities of 1 million plus people. \n\nLastly, your whole point about subdivision isn't actually how crime works. As I said, crime happens in zones. Here's an example: 10 years ago... I want to say this was Minneapolis... Anyway, a large metro area had a spike in graffiti based crimes in the poorer areas of town. If you were gonna say \"well, let's exclude that from our statistics for the city as a whole!\" what you're doing relating crime to people who might have actually had little to do with it. While there were certainly people in those neighborhoods tagging buildings, a large percentage was kids from the suburbs.  They were coming into the poor areas because they weren't gonna commit crimes in their own neighborhood, their neighborhood was nice!\n\nThis same issue is present in small towns as well. When my friends and I wanted to drink before we were 21 in the small town we grew up, we drank in the trailer park. None of us lived there, but that was the easiest way to do it for a bunch of reasons.\n\nCrime is a city wide issue. \n\nI know where you're coming from. I'm not calling you stupid. I'm not saying you're thinking is bad or evil or anything like that. It's just overly simplistic. Crime is complicated. Measuring it the way we do is to limit the amount of bullshit in an already decisive topic.",

I would NOT want to live in any of those places today!\n\nNorth County may not be a literal \"war zone\" but the way a lot of people choose to behave, it's easy to see why people would call it that.\n\nThe Florissant Walmart has issues at least weekly with shootings, shoplifting, cars stolen from their lot, and more. And then residents all complain they can't get more nice stores to open near them!\n\nAnd there's a whole area up there around N. Lindbergh and neighborhoods off it where gangs are regularly doing drive-by shootings. \n\nThere's also a big issue with a group of street racers driving mostly American muscle cars with neon underglow and the like who keep nearly causing accidents racing up I-170 and I-270.  I've encountered them several times and they almost always exit someplace near Florissant or Hazelwood. So good bet they're from that area too.\n\nThat said? It's too bad because Florissant still has some good parts and I have lots of fond memories of it. But yeah, it's rough overall.

Granted, I don\u2019t do much on the north side other than live. The gas stations are a little rough on weekends and late at night, but nothing worse than that BS that was at the end of the loop off goodfellow lol I go to Aldi, but they\u2019ve redone it and it\u2019s really nice. Other than that, I work/go to school in south city, hang out downtown or south city, etc. \n\nThey also fixed the streets just this past year to make it less available for racing. It\u2019s literally impossible now (I\u2019m talking kingshighway and natural bridge). It\u2019s annoying asf, but wayyyyy safer. \n\nOddly enough, where I\u2019m at, more middle class white folk with young kids are moving in. The school in this neighborhood is actually pretty good and Lutheran north is literally down the street, UMSL is the opposite way down the street so oddly lots of young professionals. It\u2019s weird, but not at all surprising because this neighborhood is probably the best in North county. Beautiful homes, very green, a pond and a fountain\u2026we have neighborhood functions all the time\u2026a hidden gem that middle class black folk tried to keep quiet lol\n\nThat being said, Florissant is not it and it\u2019s too far anyway.",

You're right ... it has nice homes and is pretty quiet and tucked away.\n\nThere's still some crazy stuff that happens near there though ... like around the Lucas and Hunt / Natural Bridge intersection. \n\nThe Village of Bel Nor is another one of those little areas with nice homes and quiet neighborhoods (or at least it used to be when I remember living over that way). But it was surrounded by municipalities that weren't, like Normandy and Bel Ridge and Berkeley. I think it, too, was largely made up of professors who taught at UMSL and wanted to live near the college?\n\nYou know the thing I find kind of crazy? Back when I frequented the Florissant/Spanish Lake area -- Hwy. 367 used to just be two lanes each direction with a median between it. And all the exits like Parker Road and New Jamestown Rd. were these funky things with 4 way synchronized traffic signals. Now that the area has gotten a lot more run down and traffic through there is less? They finally finished that project to redo the highway out there with more lanes and nice overpasses and off-ramps.  All those traffic signals are long gone. Seems like a waste of money having all that up there now, vs back in the 1980's and 90's when it would have been really useful!",

                          "text": "Okay. Full disclosure, I support the Second Amendment (as I do all of the US Constitution). Some arguments I have heard are the quote often attributed to Reagan: \u201cUnder no pretext should arms and ammunition be surrendered; any attempts to disarm the people must be stopped, by force if necessary.\u201d Of course, knowing that Reagan never wrote or said any such thing never stops gun nuts from quoting it and calling people who want to control guns \u2018Communists\u2019. The funny part about that is that those people are too stupid to realize that two words were changed from its original source. The word \u2018people\u2019 was substituted for \u2018workers\u2019 and the word \u2018stopped\u2019 was substituted for \u2018frustrated\u2019 in the original quote from Karl Marx - yeah, the guy who WROTE THE BOOK on Communism. \n\nThe next thing I love to hear are all of the people saying they NEED an AR-15. Now, those people need to find a dictionary and look up the word \u2018need\u2019. The primary (verb) definition of the word  \u2018need\u2019 is \u201crequire (something) because it is essential or very important.\u201d So, exactly what makes an AR-15 ESSENTIAL or \u2018VERY IMPORTANT to a civilian? \u201cI need it for hunting\u201d doesn\u2019t work. Neither does \u201cI need it for self defense\u201d. Of course the \u201cI need it to defend myself against a tyrannical government\u201d is going back to that Marx guy because \u201cMarx said the workers must first overthrow the capitalist system of private property. The workers would then replace capitalism with a communist economic system, in which they would own property in common and share the wealth they produced.\u201d That was, by the way, where he saw tyranny coming from - the wealthy oppressing the poor workers. If you think about it, he isn\u2019t really wrong about that. But I digress. Let me explain why hunting and self defense are invalid reasons for having an AR-15. \nThe AR-15 has a maximum range of 2.2 miles. If you shoot an animal from two miles away, you have to go get it, drag it out of the woods, etc. that would be two miles plus the distance you walked into the woods before taking the shot. Okay, we\u2019ll, the rifle is not really effective at that range. That maximum range is cut down to 500 yards for the M4 model and 625 yards for the M16. Again, if you are shooting that far, you need to drag the animal out as well. Plus, I don\u2019t know about you, but the open sights on the M16 were never that great for me. So, most people need a scope. That defeats the purpose of having a light rifle and a semiautomatic one at the same time (cartridge ejection is not exactly predictable). So now you are stuck aiming at a target that is often smaller than a human at a distance of five or six football fields away. Now, self defense can be equally ruled out. A mile is about 1833 yards. That means your maximum effective range is around 1/3 mile. The average city block on the east coast is about 0.1 miles long, making that effective range about three blocks. How much danger are you in from someone three blocks away? You can\u2019t hide? You can\u2019t flee? If you need an AR-15 to defend yourself against someone who can shoot you from three blocks away, you seriously pissed them off. By the way, police would also not need AR-15\u2019s if civilians didn\u2019t have them, so pretty much, nobody outside the military NEEDS them. \n\nNow, for the final argument. I am a veteran. I used to hunt. I nearly worked as a PA State Trooper. Everyone in all three groups - hunters, veterans/active military, and law enforcement - we have all met \u201cthat guy\u201d. You know, the one who shouldn\u2019t even be allowed in the same state as a gun, let alone own one. If you don\u2019t know \u2018that guy\u2019 then, as the saying goes, you might BE that guy! This is the person who cleans a loaded gun, looks down the barrel of a gun to see if it\u2019s loaded, twirls the gun by the trigger guard, or points the gun in random directions saying \u201cPew! Pew!\u201d or something equally as careless. It could also be the guy who \u2018always wanted to shoot someone to see if he could get away with it\u2019 or who flies off the handle because the neighbor is playing his stereo too loudly. So, just think about it this way. Ask yourself and your friends \u201cAm I \u2018that guy\u2019?\u201d If you aren\u2019t you can probably keep your guns. If you are, though, maybe you might want to give up those guns for the sake of your fellow gun owners, so you don\u2019t hurt them.",

Per the usual qualification we were using an M-16 and firing at targets ranging from about 50 meters to 300 meters. The targets were outlines of people from the waist up. They were painted in green I am standing in a fox hole and the guy scoring me said ok the 300 meter targets are up. I then asked him where they were located because the targets blended in with the background that looking down my sight line the target would disappear on me. They blended in so well with the background they could not be seen. I might mention, I was not the only one with this problem. Taking my experience with the M-16, I wonder if the sight picture on an Ar-15 is just as bad at a distance. If it is, then the AR-15 does not seem like a very good hunting rifle. The sights on my M-16 left a lot to be desired.",

Given that the crime rate per capita is lower in Chicago, this implies that you feel more of a connection to crimes that happen close to you geographically than you do to crimes that happen to people you know, since the latter is more common downstate, and the former is more likely to happen in Chicago. \n\nI don't actually think you're a nutcase who thinks this, and you're right that trauma is quite far reaching, but I think you're forgetting that trauma mostly comes from human connections. To take the extreme example - everyone in a community served by a school would be affected by a school shooting; but whether the school was a mile away or a tenth of a mile wouldn't really change that.",

This is a dangerous way of thinking. Take ALL the guns from law abiding citizens (TRY) and crime will be the same. Only difference is will be KNIFE attacks will skyrocket. Kinda like the U.K. is having to deal with as we speak. All it takes to stop school shootings is to put an armed Guard at every School with an AR 15 WITH 30 RD MAGS and that's the ANSWER. Every VETERAN I know said they would do it for free. But if you try and outlaw guns or try a gun grab, then America will wake a sleeping giant, and REVOLUTION 2.0 WILL START. Guns are the last line of defense against tyrannical Government.  The Constitution says, \" if the Government becomes destructive to the means of the people, it's the right of the people to institute a New Government. They wasn't talking about voting. Our forefathers would literally be at war right now with our current government. It's sad. Freedom once lost is NEVER given back. And we are far from free. We live in an illusion of freedom.",

But, they can't actually conclude that because we haven't been given the source of the other \\~87% of the weapons that weren't traced to the US (\\~26,000 that we haven't been given a source country for). They make a lot of conjecture, but there aren't really any hard numbers to prove or disprove the claim that the majority of weapons seized in Mexico come from the US.\n\nThe author goes on to essential say this.\n\n\"Of course, some or even many of the 22,800 firearms the Mexicans did not submit to ATF for tracing may have originated in the United States. \"\n\nIn fact, I'd argue that the 90% number still has relevance as it seems to be the only analysis done on the source of any of the weapons seized in Mexico.",

I'm not sure what use either of them thought a gun was going to be in those places.\n\nIntriguingly, rural Walmarts are kinda upscale, more like Target, than urban Walmarts.

Most rational people would point to the fact that they are cities with abnormally high levels of poverty, and black people as a whole are the victims of centuries of systemic oppression, so they are where there is poverty. The Democrat thing is pretty much useless info since almost all cities in America are run by Democrats, so pointing out that the ones with high poverty are also on that list doesn't indicate any sort of correlation.\n\nHowever something tells me your explanation is about to get super racist.",

His claim, which is one a bunch of conservatives falsely make, was that if you just got rid of the worst offenders of urban gun violence, then the rest of ***real*** America actually fairs much better in terms of murders. If you look at the data from the politico article, that's categorically false in every way. It's not just a bunch of Democratic outliers causing the problem with violence in America. However what you *can* point to is the fact that America, with its extremely lax gun laws, is the only developed country with the kind of violence that is here (with or without those evil Democrat cities) and the only place where mass shootings are just a regular thing. \n\nTrying to control guns using local laws is impossible because, and I don't know if you know this, US cities don't have border checkpoints. I decided to take your arguments in good faith (something I feel I'll soon find was a mistake) and check out the 5 most populous cities with Republican mayors (Forth Worth, Jacksonville, Oklahoma City, Fresno, Mesa), and compare their murder rates to those of the Democratic-led cities with the most comparable populations (Columbus, Austin, El Paso, Tucson, Kansas City). What I found was that in 3/5 of the match-ups, the Republican city had the higher murder rate. So there goes your brilliant thesis.",

I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe that you were interested in a genuine attempt at comparing actually similar cities to get a sampling of how the handful of Republican-led cities compare. What the data shows is that they rank about in the middle of all cities. If there was actually a statistical correlation like you keep trying to imply; they would be heavily skewed towards the bottom of the list. The only reason they don't happen to break the top 5 is because there's so few of them.\n\n>You want to assign blame of crime in democratic cities to a myriad of complex issues\n\nYou say this like it's something only I want. Are you seriously questioning that stance and going to pretend that having Democrats on city council is what causes crime?\n\n>and in the same argument chalk up American gun violence to \u201clax\u201d gun laws.\n\nHaving more guns causes more gun violence - there is a clear and obvious cause and effect. Other similar countries have poverty. Other similar countries have big cities. America is the one with all of the gun violence.",

Chicago doesn't have customs and border enforcement. If the country as a whole made it harder to procure guns, then yes it would be much harder to procure one. Fully automatic rifles have been illegal for almost a century and you don't see many criminals using them anymore like they used to.\n\nEven with the significant limitations of local regulations, [research shows that stricter gun laws reduce gun violence.](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1921965117) I know people like you really want it to be the case that there's nothing to be done about gun violence so there's no reason to, but the facts and figures disagree with you. You say you wish I were right, but that's a bald-faced lie. You are desperately clinging to whatever you can to not admit that more guns means more gun violence, and that gun regulations reduce the amount of guns.",

You focus only on the section at the beginning that talks about various people's predictions, while ignoring the extensive sections actually analyzing the real data. I'm not surprised that you say your beliefs are based off of you \"watch[ing] democrats (and republicans) try to regulate in the shadow of tragedy and fail often.\" It's just the vibe that you get from watching the news, not anything approaching a rigorous study of the data. So long as gun violence isn't 100% eradicated you can say \"hah! See? Gun laws don't do anything.\"\n\nIf you actually cared to read the whole report, you'll see they have looked at the effects of individual, local laws on the rate of gun violence, and it consistently causes a decrease. Even with the limitations of trying to regulate guns on a local level, it makes a difference. By framing the outcome as \"gun regulation in general only causes a 5% decrease\" you are either just flat out lying, or willfully misreading their conclusions.\n\nYou've also completely ignored the other studies that I posted that repeatedly and conclusively show that stricter gun laws result in less gun violence\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5801608/\n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l542\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6283012/",

No one is saying that the killings don't matter. In fact the left talks about the harms of gun proliferation in general all the time. Additionally, the deaths attributable to gang violence are a result of systemic poverty - something the left *also* talks about a ton and wants to fix. What makes school shootings like this stand out is that there are no larger forces at play that you can point to as the cause of the mass murder; it's just the fact that one horrible person was able to get their hands on an extremely deadly killing machine.",

Before you said no one was talking about them, and now you're just saying they don't get the same level of attention as one guy (who wasn't white btw, so sorry about that argument of yours falling apart) shooting 18 small children. No shit one of those events is a bigger story than the other.

I just did a quick Google, 2021 saw 800 murders in Chicago compared to under 600 in England but England has a much larger population. Obviously that's nearly all down to England's stricter gun control laws.\n\nI know you're implying it's cos of racism. But for stupid people who don't understand what per capita means.

They weren't cartel members, and likely wouldn't seek out those kind of people to purchase that weaponry. Multiple barriers makes it harder for communities that prey on lonely / maladjusted individuals to propagandize and convert them into shooters (like America's equivalent of bombers).\n\nAccessibility is a huge part of the issue, and while yes, criminals intending on doing something serious could go about it through dark channels...\nThey are still far more likely to be caught if the burden of monitoring is lessened in scope as well. \n\nThere isn't a panacea to 100% solve the issue, but there is a lot that can be done so that the States aren't several hundred percent higher in gun violence than other continents.\n\nThe way politicians (especially those with a fat NRA purse) propagandize any regulations at all, and American gun culture, will likely mean American gun enthusiasts accept daily deaths and consistant massacres as the price to pay for not having more barriers to entry for their hobby though. (I've seen a few who are eager to add more safety and regulation measures, but they don't seem to be a voice loud enough to compete with the NRA)",

I think a realistic approach and not a never happening dream approach would help.\n\nI for one noticed that every federal building and sporting event, concert, etc. has security with metal detectors and we don't get shootings much less mass shootings.

I also think in comparing the whole of the US is disingenuous if you are doing it to a singular country, which is why I specified continent in my own post. Europe as a whole would be a better stat to compare to, than all of the states versus another singular country, as a future reference. Try to group by similar population, otherwise, of course you'll get skewy statistics without context.\n\nI do hope you notice the NRA also bans guns at their events, on top of checkpoints and making sure no one can bring them into the convention centers. Creating a secondary TSA incarnation of safety theatre rather than directly addressing the issue seems... not a good direction to go in. Especially when some state governors (Florida the biggest offender currently) are indirectly attacking schools funding in retaliatory manner. If it was genuinely to be done, you have to understand that that level of security in schools would still go through state level legislature, and be awarded through government contracts (if its county level, it'd likely end up being ineffective or increases local taxes to cover all schools by quite a bit!).  Which would be an additional way NRA lobbied politicians can funnel state and federal money to their own businesses.",

Which a whole other debate as current criminals obtain firearms illegally on the regular.\n\nBut if we did, the data shows the homicide rate is already way higher than EU 1st world countries who don't have firearms. Restricting the easiest weapon may work, it may not. People who don't plan on murdering others will not have the ability to use a gun for self defense. So that can be an unintended consequence of having more victims of violent crimes. There was a study that I saw somewhere that there are about 70,000 gun self defense uses per year. \n\nAll things to consider.",

There will always be a way of getting them, but the aim is to make it harder to get them so bad actors have less of a chance of being successful. \n\nWe already have examples of strong gun control working in the US. You cant have an fully automatic weapon without special permits.

There is a clear correlation between people who are treated as outcasts and segregated and people who commit violent crimes. We saw it with Italian and Irish immigrants before WW2 forming mafias etc. After WW2 they were no longer treated as outcasts, got war pensions and moved out of the ghetto. \"But that was prohibition, this is different\" when demand is made illegal the outcasts of society will fill it, whatever the demographic.\n\nI don't think there is anything inherently violent about black people but some live in areas segregated by old redlining laws with low land value, shit schools, shit opportunity, and when we don't invest in our fellow human they don't turn out as productive. Many of these areas have such little investment put into them they are taxed more than they cost in taxes. These slums are subsidizing the suburbs (a tax net loss) further out of the city.",

So ill explain my claims more so you can look into them if you like. I bring up old Italian mobsters because if you tried to look at crime statistics in the 1920s you could make the same \"despite being only...\" argument with them. Italians had wildly high crime rates. Italians were able to break out of the poverty cycle because of the post WW2 GI bill, which was incredibly [racist in implementation](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-world-war-ii-vets-gi-bill/), created a windfall for Italians. I also recommend looking into redlining which forbade black people from using the mortgage help the GI bill provided in most cities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe tax stuff was referring to city and municipality taxes eg property taxes, but I think it's a fair argument because it's up to these cities to invest in these crumbling neighborhoods, because the federal and state cant.",

As in its classism but with racism on top since color of your skin is more distinguishable. \n\nLook at how major city areas were created in US history to what they are today. Its all cloaked in racism/classism. These large cities are the way the are due to it. If you want to better understand it then you need to read up on a lot of US history from many different sources. \n\nAnd it wasnt just from one group, Republican or Democrat back then, the entire system was basically put in place to establish classism. Which they even sort of flipped flopped in the civil rights era when Johnson backed the civil rights act. Who was then proceeded by Richard Nixon...\n\nThats why when people say \"All democratic cities have the most gun violence\"\n\nIts a disingenuous argument with racist undertones, as they are discussing the outcome but not the history that made it that way.\n\nIts doesnt make the person racist, its just obvious what they actually mean, its prejudice or if those labels are hurting peoples feelings, its biased. \n\nTheres a lot of historical proof backing this, and its pretty easy to find. But people have to want to understand and seek that information, those who say what I quoted often dont because of exactly what I said, theyve already established their bias and believe the propaganda that supports it. \n\nBasically what all the protests were about recently. Poor communities have more crime, historically when an entire system is built on keeping those communities \"poor\" its a self fulfilling prophecy. And now its apart of that culture, to an extent. \n\nThis is why the other poster brought up Italians, it was an example of a similar phenomena but to a lesser degree as they aren't as distinguishable, now, as it would be with skin color.  When they were first starting off as first generation immigrants it was more noticeable/easier to put them into a different class. \n\nThe reason Chicago is picked often is because yes it does correlate, its the \"easy pick\" to make a disingenuous argument due to its past history and how that history was (incorrectly) taught in schools. Its used as regurgitated propaganda basically from prohibition years Its also very liberal. Butsimilar issues happen in places like Jacksonville, FL. But why isnt that city used as an example by those people? Because its more Republican.\n\nThe great migration to cities, like Chicago, happened in the 1920s due to black people trying to escape Jim Crow laws. These cities were becoming major producers that needed workers, and it was cheaper to employee black people than their white counter part. \n\nBut these same areas wanted the labor but didnt want to give them the same rights, of both easily distinguishable first generation immigrants and blacks.\n\nThats why you have large urban centers, mostly all democratic leaning, with large black populations. \n\nThats also why a lot of black people are moving out and away from these Urban centers now and going back south as no Jim Crow laws exists, but also weather, work opportunity, again production etc.\n\nIts way more complicated then ive attempted to lay out here ive left a lot out. But its a okay jumping off point.",

                  "text": "IMHO, USA can't handle multiple parties. It's not cos the system of voting etc means it's classed as a \"flawed democracy\" (iirc it's ranked 20th best in the world so that's still pretty good though), nah, it's because the culture there is super heavy on definition and us vs them. Not just in politics, but in everything.  \n\nWorldwide the importance of labeling your personality (eg. I'm a hungry hippos soccer fan, or I'm Portuguese, or I'm a hippy) and through that belonging to a group is universal. Humans like their tribes.  \n\nAmericans seem to have more emphasis on it then elsewhere and want everything in black and white groups. The tribalism is strong. Perhaps because of their short history in a large country of immigrants, it was important to have clear cut major categories. So it generally skews towards yes/no us/them black/white etc.  \n\nAmericans will ask \"are you a cat person or a dog person?\" Whereas elsewhere you might hear \"do you like animals?\" Or \"what pets do you have?\" Or \"what animal do you relate to?\". This/That vs more open ended allowing for multiple answers. Sure, you can say \"neither, I'm a hippo person\", but people will think you're weird. You have to be a dog person or a cat person. That is the question.   \n\nOr they'll ask \"Are you pro or anti X?\". They don't like nuanced answers about how you think the x needs altered, parts of x are good and parts bad, or you like x but think it needs redesigned or restricted. Worst is if you say you like Y. \n\nThat's my opinion on one reason why multiple party systems would struggle in USA. The culture wants to know are you red or are you blue, and doesn't like when there's more than two answers. Generally, hardly anyone in the states wants to be different and support team green or yellow or people or whatever. They want everything clear cut yes/no red/blue.  \n\n I'm going to get to downvoted to hell for this post because I rambled a lot and it's all opinion, but whatever.  \n\n It's not meant to be critical, just a cultural difference I've noticed.   \n\n**TLDR; The tribalism in USA is different to elsewhere (where it's just as strong), and prefers black/white yes/no cat/dog options. The mentality is not my tribe vs multiple stranger tribes, it's more like my tribe vs the other tribe, so third parties will always struggle**.",

Or, as one of many alternative explanations, it might be that the higher crime rate is actually caused by a small number of (overwhelmingly) blue voters, leading others in these states to vote red as a consequence (because they think red will do more against crime or whatever). \n\nI'm not saying the latter is the actual mechanism (it might be, I'm too lazy to look up stats about who actually does the killings in these red states), but obviously infering from aggregate correlations to individual statements is dead wrong and so are most of the statements in this thread.",

The exact same stat is true for Wyoming vs Massachusetts. Hawaii is statistically a very safe state but it doesn't seem to have any correlation to its gun laws in and of themselves.

You have to attach your ID/passport to the application and prove that you are legally allowed to own a weapon in your home country. And after that, the police get to decide whether or not you're allowed to purchase a weapon. \n\n\n>All I have to do is own a few guns and no I\u2019m showing proof I\u2019m a collector.\n\nIf you were a Swiss citizen and you already owned a few guns, then you've already gone through the process a few times, so yea, it would be easier. As a foreigner, especially from the states, they might not take your previous gun ownership as proof of being a collector.\n\nEdit: also no, they're not lenient. They have more requirements to obtain a weapon than Massachusetts and Hawaii. Which is where this conversation started.",

Because Duke was (and is) an open racist. So now people could just point at the Republican party and say they're racists. Which is what Atwater wanted to avoid because he knew racism was indefensible, but he also wanted to continue being racist.\n\nSo yeah, I'm not going to pile accolades on him for doing what was in his best interests.",

[SOURCE (PDF)](https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2017/October/GTR2017.pdf). The same is likely true for the other cities listed. Since it's relatively difficult to legally obtain firearms in those cities, they have to come from somewhere else. \n\nAs for those cities being \"controlled by Democrats\", that's just true for most big cities. Large metropolitan cities tend to have a more diverse population, and diversity tends to skew politics to the left. That's why the majority of small rural towns are red from top to bottom. Lack of diversity in population translates to lack of diversity in thought.",

But I'm pro gun.\n\nFor three reasons. \n\n1 it's literally in the founding declaration of this country, and to take it out or ignore it is illegal.\n\n2 there's already too many guns in the wild to pull back now. There's no way to remove guns from criminal hands without a huge and rights breaking movement from the government. There will be pushback and problems. And the difference between one gun and another is a joke. It's an illusion for the government to ban one kind of gun but allow another, they want you to think that will do something but... Really seams dumb to me. Other than automatic vs semi automatic, which does make a small difference... Maybe.\n\nAnd 3 if the government is the only body allowed with weapons... The people can lose all of their power to corrupt and tyrannical officials. And how would we ever get it back? No guns means no fight... We would be powerless. Better to keep our power then to hand it over just for safety. It's not that we should ever use it, but just having it... That's enough to make assholes think about if they can get away with something. They have to do their dirty deeds in the dark or be caught which limits them. (Hopefully I'm getting my point across ok)\n\n\n\nThe only argument against guns, is some people are crazy and might shoot kids... But try as we might we can legalize our way out of crazy people they've been around since long before America existed and the only way to defend against them is to prepare a defense and offense not cripple everybody to try and stop them.\n\n\ud83d\ude13But I don't know anything like I said, so maybe the world would be better without guns in the public hands...

You probably don't even agree with half the stuff the Democrats or progressives want, and your family probably don't actually agree with half the stuff the Republicans want. I think people need to ask themselves if they are offended when someone calls out their \"brand\" of politics or affiliated party (e.g liberals are lunatics, conservatives are stupid). If you feel personally attacked, you are probably already playing into the world of identity politics. People should be critical of every government or political party and avoid labels. People should also respect the position of government. Obama and Trump had flaws, and should have been called out on them, but in a respectful way (As they say, respect the position not the person). But being critical of either should never make someone feel personally under attack. Politicians and political activists aren't your family - they are elected to represent you and work for you. Your family is your family.",

      "text": "Crime stats, especially crime stats around firearms violence in the U.S. are fascinating to dive into. My ultimate conclusion from my own research is that both restrictive and permissive gun laws have little effect in either direction regarding violent crime in the United States. Regional culture and other socio-economic factors seem to be the only reliable predictors of firearm homicide rates. \n\nFor example Idaho has a firearm homicide rate of 0.8 per 100,000 residents while New York has a firearm homicide rate of 2.7 per 100,000 residents. Pro-gun people will say that this is because Idaho's lax gun laws make it safer than New York. If we flip this though and compare Hawaii with 0.5 firearms homicides per 100,000 residents to Florida's whopping 3.4 firearms homicides per 100,000 residents it could be easy for anti-gun people to equally say Hawaii is safe with its restrictive gun laws while Florida is unsafe with its lax gun laws. \n\nThe truth of the matter is that the only crime reduction that seems to statistically directly correlate with high rates of firearms ownership is reducing home invasions (people don't want to kick in doors of houses when the owner is home when the odds of the homeowner being armed is high). The only firearms violence that seems to directly correlate to high firearm ownership rates in and of themselves seems to be suicide by firearm. Guns are essentially magic \"painless\" suicide machines and their availability unsurprisingly correlates to firearm based suicide. Virtually everything else seems to boil down to regional culture, population density, and other socio-economic factors. \n\nA final aside for this, I live in Portland Oregon and the city's gun laws are more or less forced to match the state due to our state's preemption statute. Portland is by far one of the most violent and dangerous parts of the state while having a regional culture that largely demonizes gun ownership while certain rural cities in Oregon like Pendleton (with robust gun cultures) enjoy a violent crime rate comparable to cities in Norway and Finland. Portland and Pendleton functionally have the same gun laws but have wildly different outcomes regarding firearms homicide. The reasons behind this seem to be locked in the previously mentioned differences in regional culture and other socioeconomic factors.",

That\u2019s based on a murder rate of 6.4 per 100,000, with 20,982 murders in 2020 and a population of 329.5 million.\n\nNow for the cities to be removed: 1. Chicago: 774 murders, pop 2.7 million 2. Detroit: 267 murders, pop 672k 3. Washington DC: 298 murders, pop 702k 4. St Louis: 263 murders, pop 305k 5. Philadelphia: 499 murders, pop 1.6 million\n\nSo that\u2019s a total of 2101 murders, and 6 million population. Subtract those from the nation total and we are left with 18,881 murders and a population of 323.5 million. That\u2019s a murder rate of 5.8 per 100,000, which is a bit better, but still leaves the US at 65th highest murder rate (out of 195). Every 1st world nation on the planet, and quite a few 2nd and 3rd world nations would still have significantly lower murder rates than the US even with those 5 cities removed.",

It's not like anyone is suggesting we get rid of hunting rifles. But yes, continue to believe that people will fight tooth and nail to have access to a particular subclass of weapons.\n\nThe issue is one of narrative, not one of practicality. In fact, I would not be shocked if most responsible gun owners would happily agree with the new laws if they realized the laws would have little to no impact on their actual gun ownership.",

It requires 2/3rds of the House and Senate or 3/4\u2019s of the states approval after a Constitutional Conference which requires 2/3rds of the states to start, it\u2019s extremely unlikely to get repealed. If it did it\u2019s generally accepted we\u2019d have to buy back the estimated 81 million guns. Let\u2019s go with a very low average for a gun, let\u2019s say $500. That\u2019s going to cost taxpayers $40 billion dollars, what about firearms accessories? Does Jim-Boi get to keep his 25 30 round AR magazines? Holographic sights? Scope? Slings? Extra parts? Ammo? Equipment to make his ammo? All the stuff for skeet shooting? Stuff non-gun owners don\u2019t care or think about. On top of that we have to hire people and buy equipment to process those guns. If it only cost $25 to process each gun (wages and logistics, locations, transport and destruction, all combined) that\u2019s only another $2 billion. Now imagine if the government didn\u2019t buy the guns back, and I\u2019m sure plenty of vocal anti-gun people would be happy with that option to literally make gun owners pay. Pretend there was no civil unrest from that, no violence from Proud Boys, Oathkeepers, Cospatriots, people that wear confederate flags, roll coal, fantasize about \u201cowning libtards\u201d, cops, basically the worst Americans. Are all those people going to bring their firearms and turn them in? What percent of legal gun owners will not? How would the government know which ones since there is no list of people who own guns (8 states require registration.) How would the government get the firearms away from criminals? Even if there wasn\u2019t due process and the 4th Amendment\u2019s protection from searches without warrants, how much would door to door searches for guns cost? There are 130 million households in the US at last count (2018). If searching a home cost $300 and you only had to search 5% percent of homes it will only add another $2 billion dollars to the cost. Plus the costs of the Constitutional Conference. Just a thought experiment with napkin math. \n\n\n - For comparison the total 2022 US military budget is $773 billion.",

And anecdotally speaking, I\u2019ve met many people who hold values and opinions \u201cfrom both sides\u201d, and I think to say half their philosophy is garbage without knowing their reasoning would be a unfairly conclusive.\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to comment back genuinely. We may disagree on some things but intelligent and courteous discourse can help people understand varying perspectives",

Biological males can grow breasts and sometimes even lactate when taking estrogen.

It's kind of hard to believe conservatives are still pushing such a lazy talking point years after it was throughly debunked. There was bipartisan consensus in the US and within our allies in Europe  that Shokin needed to be removed. Biden wasn't going on a rogue shakedown, he was representing the stated foreign policy interests of the US government. Shokin was so obviously corrupt that this wasn't even a controversial position at the time (you know, before conservatives lined up like lemmings to get force fed this narrative). \n\nIronically, it's *still* in dispute whether or not Shokin was even investigating Burisma at the time, part of the reason there was such a wide, cross-interest desire to see him gone was his habitual *refusal* to investigate corruption. \n\n\n>something Trump was impeached for doing.\n\nMore ridiculous false equivalencies, but it's nice seeing a conservative at least implicitly admit they think Trump did something wrong. Maybe we're moving forward.",

It's not even a rounding error. \n\nWhat is not insignificant, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths: \n\n\u2022 22,938 (76%) are by suicide which can't be prevented by gun laws (3) \n\n\u2022 987 (3%) are by law enforcement, thus not relevant to Gun Control discussion. (4) \n\n\u2022 489 (2%) are accidental (5) \n\nSo no, \"gun violence\" isn't 30,000 annually, but rather 5,577... 0.0017% of the population. \n\nStill too many? Let's look at location: \n\n298 (5%) - St Louis, MO (6) \n\n327 (6%) - Detroit, MI (6) \n\n328 (6%) - Baltimore, MD (6) \n\n764 (14%) - Chicago, IL (6) \n\nThat's over 30% of all gun crime. In just 4 cities. \n\nThis leaves 3,856 for for everywhere else in America... about 77 deaths per state. Obviously some States have higher rates than others \n\nYes, 5,577 is absolutely horrific, but let's think for a minute... \n\nBut what about other deaths each year? \n\n70,000+ die from a drug overdose (7) \n\n49,000 people die per year from the flu (8) \n\n37,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (9) \n\nNow it gets interesting: \n\n250,000+ people die each year from preventable medical errors. (10) \n\nYou are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital! \n\n610,000 people die per year from heart disease (11) \n\nEven a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save about twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). \n\nA 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides. \n\nSimple, easily preventable, 10% reductions! \n\nWe don't have a gun problem... We have a political agenda and media sensationalism problem. \n\nHere are some statistics about defensive gun use in the U.S. as well. \n\nhttps://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3#14 \n\nPage 15: \n\nAlmost all national survey estimates indicate that defensive gun uses by victims are at least as common as offensive uses by criminals, with estimates of annual uses ranging from about 500,000 to more than 3 million (Kleck, 2001a), in the context of about 300,000 violent crimes involving firearms in 2008 (BJS, 2010). \n\nThat's a minimum 500,000 incidents/assaults deterred, if you were to play devil's advocate and say that only 10% of that low end number is accurate, then that is still more than the number of deaths, even including the suicides. \n\nOlder study, 1995: \n\nhttps://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6853&context=jclc \n\nPage 164 \n\nThe most technically sound estimates presented in Table 2 are those based on the shorter one-year recall period that rely on Rs' first-hand accounts of their own experiences (person-based estimates). These estimates appear in the first two columns. They indicate that each year in the U.S. there are about 2.2 to 2.5 million DGUs of all types by civilians against humans, with about 1.5 to 1.9 million of the incidents involving use of handguns. \n\nr/dgu is a great sub to pay attention to, when you want to know whether or not someone is defensively using a gun \n\n\u2014\u2014sources\u2014\u2014 \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr64/nvsr64_02.pdf \n\nhttps://everytownresearch.org/firearm-suicide/ \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhamcs/web_tables/2015_ed_web_tables.pdf \n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2017/?tid=a_inl_manual \n\nhttps://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-accidental-gun-deaths-20180101-story.html \n\nhttps://247wallst.com/special-report/2018/11/13/cities-with-the-most-gun-violence/ (stats halved as reported statistics cover 2 years, single year statistics not found) \n\nhttps://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/faq.htm \n\nhttps://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/812603 \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/02/22/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-america.html \n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm",

Restricting access to firearms would SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the number of successful suicide attempts in this country, especially considering most suicide attempts are during moments of acute feelings. \n\nLaw enforcement is shooting people because those people also have guns. Again, lessening the number of guns in private hands lessens the need for police to shoot.\n\nAccidental firearm discharges \"don't count?!?\" Yeah, I'm sure those parents whose toddler shot themselves really don't think their kid mattered. What the actual fuck. Wouldn't mandatory gun training and lock laws be effective at helping to prevent accidents?",

Right off the bat you claim that 77% of gun deaths don't really count and aren't preventable because they are suicides. I didn't see you mention injuries from firearms, so I'm not sure if that counts to you either.\n\nHow do you get to determine what counts?\n\nHow do you know they aren't preventable? There are plenty of times where I thought \"if I had a gun right now...\", but I don't, and I'm still alive.\n\nAlso the premise \"why care about this problem when there are other bigger problems no one cares about\" is false. First, you can care about and work on multiple problems at the same time. Second, if you look for it, many people and organizations are trying to reduce leading causes of death like heart disease.\n\nFinally, there's a level of connection to the cause that's not the same. In many cases, health issues and car crashes can be mitigated by the people involved. Certainly many people just have bad luck, like getting hot by a drunk driver or having a rare genetic disorder. However, with school shootings, there is no connection at all - just innocent bystanders caught up.\n\nWe can ask people to take better care of their health, we can ask people to be safer drivers, we can't ask people to not be at the site of a mass shooting.\n\nI'm not refuting any of your data and I appreciate that you brought it to the table. There absolutely should be more done on some of the larger scale causes of premature death, but it's not fair to say that 95% of gun deaths don't count or draw these other subjective and misleading conclusions from that data.",

Doesn't matter- you didn't die, so you don't get in the statistics. \n\nThe argument seems to paint it as black and white and \"ALL OR NOTHING\".  \n\nProgress isn't instant fixes - and is seldom quick.  Just because a solution doesn't immediately eradicate EVERY possible bad outcome doesn't mean it's not still progress.  People still die in car accidents, but that doesn't make seatbelts pointless. \n\nRight away, the argument is changed because someone is talking about  one, specific item \"DEATH by firearms\" and another person is arguing about \"Firearm violence \" - two related, but different things.\n\nStats are just data.  How they are read/interpreted tells stories. The people who write the articles interpret them.  \n\nSaying not enough people die from a thing to warrant change is just one way someone could choose to look at something.\n\nSaying you're statistically unlikely to die from a specific incident is a great way to dismiss just about anything.  *Most* people die of \"natural\" (and often preventable to a point) causes.  So \"all or nothing\" attitudes say the rest isn't worth focusing on.  It's anti-progress. \n\nAlso, the first link and refence (firearms related deaths) is from a 2016 report - the more recent 2020 report is about 50% higher.  And, perhaps as important \"The total excludes deaths in which gunshot injuries played a contributing, but not principal, role. (CDC fatality statistics are based on information contained in official death certificates, which identify a single cause of death.)\" \n\nIt also shows that suicides \"only\" accounted for 54% of gun related deaths - not the 76% quoted.\n\nMore goodies:\n\n>The 45,222 total gun deaths in 2020 were by far the most on record, representing a 14% increase from the year before, a 25% increase from five years earlier and a 43% increase from a decade prior.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/\n\nThere's always stats to pick - and there's data that can be used to argue multiple views.",

Also what kind of solution is it to require security in every school, when many school districts across the country can't even afford adequate supplies or books for their classrooms?\n\nStrict lock door procedures--how do you know this school didn't have those? The fact that procedures weren't followed doesn't mean they didn't exist. \n\nAn aware community that reports severe mental health issues - - what severe mental health issue symptoms should the average person in this community should have reported? And how do people distinguish between \"this person has mental health issues but won't commit violence\" or \"this person will commit violence\"? Or are we just going to assume everyone with mental health issues who does something that makes us uncomfortable should be monitored by the police? Does that really seem like a plausible long term strategy? \n\nAlso I'm not sure that most people are asking for a blanket ban on guns; that seems like a strawman argument more than anything. But the point of targeting lax or nonexistent gun restrictions rather than these other things is (1) most of what you were suggesting already existed and was not enough, (2) most of what you're suggesting requires literally an entire community doing everything perfectly to prevent an armed dude from exploiting a weakness in the system, which is unrealistic, and (3) when you make it harder for people to have weapons like guns, you make it harder for people to make the decision to go out to kill a bunch of people (easier to feel like a big man who's ready to go out an inflict pain on others when you have body armor and a gun than it is when all you have is your mom's butcher knife), and make it harder for them to actually kill or wound a bunch of people even if they decide to go through with it (because it's easier to be unarmed and take down a guy with a knife than it is to do the same with a guy with body armor and a gun). It mitigates the amount of potential death and destruction a person can actually accomplish, in other words, in the event that imperfect people inevitably slip up in this system of self-reporting and security you propose we have.\n\nAgain, you don't need a blanket and total ban on guns to get there. You just need more oversight than what most states have right now.",

No. Ive talkes to a dozen or so people since this happened whove wanted massive gun restriction.\n\nPlus, its what dems say every time there is a school shooting. Politicians are yelling at the NRA and saying the seller of a weapon should be charged with crimes parallel to the shooter.\n\nDo you think this was a snap decision on the kids part? It was not. It rarely is. There are often manifestos and thought out plans. So make it harder to get a gun? How? How would that prevent this? It would affect law abiding citizens fsr more that it would stop school shootings. \n\nThe solutions i provided are direct and deliberate. They dont affect much outside the problem area. Blanket laws to marginally reduce school shootings, maybe, while making it harder for law abiding citizens, isnt something i can get behind when direct solutions are brushed aside.\n\nEspecially because guns are used in stopping crime more often than theyre used in comitting it.",

Then the cycle repeats. \n\nI agree you can\u2019t eliminate all guns, but I think you can\u2019t eliminate all opportunities either. Instead I think you need to be proactive on all fronts. So yes, improve security but also make it harder for people to get guns quickly, and make it easier for them to get help when they need it. \n\nThe big question everyone seems to be ignoring is why do so many Americans feel that the way to deal with being hurt is to hurt other people? What can be done to change that?",

Gun ownership correlates with suicide rates (rural men). Gun access is absolutely tied to suicide rates and is a serious issue.\n\nI'm ambivalent to to guns and I'm not calling for gun control here. If owning a gun makes you feel safer, cool, but please be responsible.

That is what I'm saying is inhumane. \n\n> Certainly rare enough to justify the benefits, particularly since banning them won't change anything.\n\nI don't know to me it looks like the benefits are a pretence of self-protection that isn't really working as the US are less safe than other demographically similar countries with stricter gun laws and less guns in civilians hands. I also don't think that the joy of going to shooting ranges, or whatever the tons of reasons you mean are, outweigh dead children, non-lethal gun accidents and lots of successful suicide attempts.\n\n> Address mental health, home situations, and major news networks' continued decision to plaster shooters' names and faces all across the world as a guarantee of fame for future shooters, and if that doesn't work *then* talk to me about \"common sense\" gun control.\n\nThat is a very fair point but why even distribute or rather have guns easily accessible amongst a population with said mental health problems?\n\nEdit: phrasing.",

It clearly starts with a hypothesis and then tries to find data from years that fit it and use false equivalencies. America also has a big problem with heart disease which it does little about, who knew? \n\nhttps://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/\n\nIn 2020, the most recent year for which complete data is available, 45,222 people died from gun-related injuries in the U.S.\n\nThough they tend to get less public attention than gun-related murders, suicides have long accounted for the majority of U.S. gun deaths. In 2020, 54% of all gun-related deaths in the U.S. were suicides (24,292), while 43% were murders (19,384), according to the CDC. The remaining gun deaths that year were unintentional (535), involved law enforcement (611) or had undetermined circumstances (400).\n\nI truly do not understand this point of view. How can you possibly believe thousands of people dying is not a problem. Especially when a decent proportion are children/teenagers/young adults. It's something a sociopath or a dictator might say. How can you be so cold to avoidable early death?\n\nThese stats also don't take into account the pretty uniquely American phenomena of mass/school shootings which just do not happen in the developed world with the same frequency and deadliness.",

For other countries famous for very strict gun control, Australias murder rate in 2021 was .8 and Japans was one of the lowest at .2. \n\nSorry for any grammar or spelling issues, I typed this out on my phone.",

Chicago: 774 murders, pop 2.7 million\n2. Detroit: 267 murders, pop 672k\n3. Washington DC: 298 murders, pop 702k\n4. St Louis: 263 murders, pop 305k\n5. Philadelphia: 499 murders, pop 1.6 million\n\nSo that\u2019s a total of 2101 murders, and 6 million population.  Subtract those from the nation total and we are left with 18,881 murders and a population of 323.5 million.  That\u2019s a murder rate of 5.8 per 100,000, which is a bit better, but still leaves the US at 65th highest murder rate (out of 195). Every 1st world nation on the planet, and quite a few 2nd and 3rd world nations would still have significantly lower murder rates than the US even with those 5 cities removed.\n\nSo all of it is untrue.",

People in the middle of a murderous fury don\u2019t have good survival instincts.\n\nIf everyone were rational, no one would murder currently because they don\u2019t want to go to jail.  Clearly there are a lot of people who make irrational decisions.",

Reason why that schools are as bad as they are. Everyone, simply, does not immediately become a shooter once they have access to a wife. They now have the ability to protect themselves and anyone who would violate their property or their life. \n\nI don\u2019t think I will ever understand why people want to get rid of guns, because gun control with in itself gets rid of the individuals ability to protect themselves, especially from the state. Throughout history, when a  government owns all the guns they all won a total monopoly over violence. Meaning that they use this to get rid of the individuals ability and the right to experience liberty. \n\nA free society does not come from a gunless society, and that\u2019s the entire reason why the second amendment was implemented into our constitution in the first place.

The only false part is that we have the third highest murder rate in the world but the idea that he was trying to convey that a tiny number of urban poor areas are responsible for the vast majority of violent crime and murders in America is 100% correct.

Fact check is proving itself again to be useless and misleading, yeah the exact murder rate was wrong, but the general claim is 100% correct.",

Ask him \u201cwhat makes you think that?\u201d \u201cWhere are you getting this information from?\u201d \u201cwhy should you believe them?\u201d \u201cHow do you know they\u2019re not just lying to manipulate you?\u201d \n\n\nActually show an interest in him coz goddamn - you\u2019re mean to him",
