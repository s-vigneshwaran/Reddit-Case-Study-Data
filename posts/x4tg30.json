Bart is alone in the classroom, standing next to a couple of animal cages.]  \nBart: [voice-over] I was trying to breed the hamster with the lizard to create an unholy super-creature, when I saw an even worse crime against nature.  \n[Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel burst into the classroom, kissing and locked in a passionate embrace. Bart, unnoticed by the couple, quickly hides in a closet.]  \nSkinner: Ah, Head Lice Inspection Day. While the kids are out gettin' their nits picked, we can have our own private cootie call.  \nMrs. Krabappel: Oh, you talk too much. Let's do it on Martin's desk!  \nSkinner: It is usually the cleanest.  \n[They go to the desk. Mrs. Krabappel brushes a pencil off and Skinner sets her down on it.]  \nBart: [Watching from inside the closet] Eeeeewwwwwwww!!!! [closes the door and turns his back on it]  \nBart: [voice-over] I needed to get my mind on something else\u2014anything else. And for the first time in my life, education was the answer.  \n[Bart looks at the wall and notices a chart of the Solar System, with illustrations of the planets.]  \nBart: [reading chart] Mercury... Venus... Earth... Mars...  \nSkinner: [offscreen, in the classroom] C'mon, Edna, don't be tardy!  \nBart: [now even more focused on the chart] Mercury... Venus... Earth... Mars... Jupiter... Saturn... Uranus... Neptune... Pluto.  \n[Back to the present.]  \nBart: So when I took the test, the answers were stuck in my brain. It was like a whole different kind of cheating!\n\n-Homer vs Dignity, airdate November 26, 2000",
