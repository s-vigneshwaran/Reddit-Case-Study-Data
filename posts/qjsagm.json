A law passed in July 1955 by a joint resolution of the 84th Congress (Pub.L. 84\u2013140) and approved by President Dwight Eisenhower requires that \"In God We Trust\" appear on all American currency. Two years later, the phrase was used on paper money for the first time \u2014 on the updated one-dollar silver certificate that entered circulation on October 1, 1957.[8] The 84th Congress later passed legislation (Pub.L. 84\u2013851), also signed by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1956, declaring the phrase to be the national motto.[8][a] Several states have also mandated or authorized its use in public institutions or schools;[9][10] while Florida, Georgia and Mississippi have incorporated the phrase in some of their state symbols.",

Churches are definitely allowed to participate in politics, they simply have to give up their tax exemptions the same as any other 501(c) that acts as a political group instead of a charitable organization.\n\nThe motto on the currency is an example of the courts blatantly lying to promote religion when they know it is against the clear meaning of the Constitution. Sooner or later it will be recognized that invoking the name of a deity is definitely religious in nature contrary to the standing claim that is has no religious significance. No one belies the lie.\n\nThere are plenty of laws that have no secular basis that are still enforced today. I live in a dry county and anyone that claims it is not a evangelical misunderstanding of their own religion is lying. Those people have to ignore reality to maintain their delusions. The central sacrament of Christianity is the Eucharist which involves retelling the Last Supper, a Passover seder, which requires taking of wine. Passover is and always has been in spring. Grapes ripen in the fall and there was no way to retain grape juice without refrigeration. The Hebrews and Romans knew what wine was and didn't mean grape juice when they wrote about it but this remains today the reasoning behind prohibition where I live. Sailing on a ship of fools.",

People only tolerate him because he fell ass backwards into undeserved wealth and the idea that he was some genius businessman was played up as a joke that he never even realized he was the butt of. Nobody took the guy seriously except for rubes who didn't know any better and they got clued in real quick when he stiffed them on the bill.\n\nThe fact that fucking *Donald Trump* is their guy just blows my mind. At this point, I can barely respect anyone that still feels the Republican Party is worth supporting, but anyone who supports Donald Trump is a flat out moron.",

There is no sense of flow or movement beyond the faint impression that the Trump figure might accidentally topple onto it's face and I suspect that's not the sense they were going for. There is no inspired imagery, sense of wonder or pleasure in looking at it. It's message isn't subtle or clever and when you finally, blessedly, get to drag your eyes away from it, it doesn't leave you pondering some profound complexity. \nThe only surprising thing about it is that the perpetrators didn't feel compelled to clearly label each figure, which is a particular feature of right-wing cartoon humour. I give it a solid  2/15 and a heartfelt apology to each of the 9 Muses that such a monstrosity was ever conceived. I may or may not be joking.",

This has none and the subjects are even divided awkwardly by the borders of each canvas. One large canvas would have been much more effective since the artist seemed to be attempting to adhere to the rule of thirds. Composition wise it\u2019s a real mess. Now let\u2019s get to the subjects. Proportions are all over the place. If you can\u2019t paint anatomy well, at least use a reference model. You\u2019ve got a giant light source in the sky, both thematically and literally, and yet the lighting appears to be coming from every direction at once. The drapery on the robes is also pretty poorly done. Overall, this is painting is bland and pedestrian.",
