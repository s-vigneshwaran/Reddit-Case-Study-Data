What kind of bullshit is that?\n\nSome may say caring for the kids leaving is part of it, but there are social systems capable of handling parenting. Also, any 16 year old boy up to 60 year old men are not allowed to leave (those above this age are pensioners who are also not leaving). So there seems to be an interesting silence there. Speaks volumes, that 16 year old girls are not also told to stay and fight. The mother arguments does not work there, and who says a father should die for others?\n\nVery clear illustrations of the hypocrisy of feminism, and the idea that men and women are equal.

          "text": "Note really. The best way to go is to set up a government subsidized education system. Subsidized meaning you still pay for accommodation and about 30% of tuition. Then begin restructuring how these loans are paid. You only pay if you're actually working, and it doesn't affect anything in your life. You are required to pay, but it is an isolated loan.\n\nThis is how most reasonable countries do it. Mine effectively solved the problem of education expense by making it a mostly taxpayer issue. The little that's left can be loaned to a student, and the accommodation may also come from the loan.\n\nWhat the job requirement does, is it encourages the government to pass policies that would increase job opportunities. This essentially makes the loan pay itself. The isolated loan also means one can take business loans, and that improves job opportunities, and the fact that people can actually pay the loans. The truly open market also means business is easy to start and thoroughly competitive (which forces self- imposed higher quality regulations apart from those in policy).\n\nI could write a whole article on how exactly to solve this. But I'm not American, so Americans will have to come up with their own solutions. That said, phuck feminism!",

In school there is always group work and the group is mostly female with a small bit of males always. The groups are graded by what they produce in the end so there is no serpration the grading is the same for all. If the girls want to do nothing they can. If the boy does not want to fail or boy they must do all the work themselves in order not to. The reason behind this is that they can ask to be resigned and give the reason but they will be denied always. Plus both male and female teachers favor female students.\n\nEdit: group work is a major part is school now. Just about every day or 3.",
