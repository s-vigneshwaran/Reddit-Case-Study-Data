  "text": "TIFU by letting a delirious woman into my house thinking she had heat stroke. She was a mental patient from the hospital who proceeded to sit on my sofa and masturbate\nThis happened yesterday in the UK while we are going through the hottest heatwave on record. It's 4PM and I'm minding my own business in my back garden tidying my shed when i hear somebody trying to get into my back gate. I peek through the gap to see an elderly woman looking very hot and distressed, she notices me and starts shouting please help me, please help me. I can't open the gate, so I tell her to go to the front door. I ran through the house and told her to come in and take a seat while I get her a glass of water.  She's mumbling gibberish and rocking back and forth. Tells me she is lost. I suspected she had heat stroke and was suffering from delirium and exhaustion. Poor woman, thank god I saved her.\n\nI pop upstairs to get a damp towel and the fan. When I return I find the woman sitting on my sofa, smoking a cigarette, masturbating. Great.\n\n\"You can't do that\" I yell in bemusement but she carries on, telling me how nice it feels. \"Can you lick my clitoris?\" she asks, to which I said no way and she needs to leave. \"Do you have a dog?\" I see my chance to get her out of the house. \"Yes I have a dog, come with me\" and I managed to get her up and out into the garden.\n\nShe collapses onto the floor. Making gagging noises, telling me she's going to die, still with her hand between her legs. It is 40 degrees and I myself am struggling to be fair, so I know she will be in trouble if I don't get her out of the heat. \n\nI call 999, they take 5 minutes to answer, and eventually they tell me there are no ambulances. \"Is she breathing... is she conscious... OK then, if she passes out, put her in the discovery position and fan her, then call us back and we will try to hurry up.\"\n\nShe keeps asking for the dog and that she wants us both to make love to her. When I try to move her into the house she keeps grabbing me and trying to kiss me. What the hell am I going to do?  \nThe hospital is a 5 minute walk, so I make the decision to get her there by carrying her or she is going to die from heat stroke. So I tell her I know a really nice dog across the road and I'm going to take her to it. Her eyes light up and she heads with me out of the garden. \n\nI get her to put her leggings on and begin to walk to the hospital while being sexually assaulted the whole way. 999 rings me back and I tell them the plan. The closest door is the ear and throat department or something like that, so I carry her in there where there is air conditioning and sit her down. I shout for help and a nurse appears, she fetches some water and I leave her in their capable hands. They all seemed to know who she was and apparently she had been on the mental ward. As I walk out she yells \"Where is this dog to lick my clitoris??\"  The nurses look puzzled, I shrug my shoulders and walk out. \n\nI return home, lock all the doors and gates, and have a shower to wash the woman's sweat and fanny juice off me. I've not seen her today, hope she is feeling better.\n\nIf the mods so wish I can verify the story with video evidence as my house has Nest cameras, but I won't post these publicly for obvious reasons. \n\nTLDR: I let a delirious woman into my house thinking she had heat stroke. She turned out to be a mental patient from the hospital who proceeded to masturbate on my sofa and sexually assault me\n\nEdit 1: Gonna leave in the typo of recovery/discovery, I believe they call that a Freudian slip\n\nEdit 2: Getting lots of requests, so here is a photo from my back garden cctv: [https://imgur.com/a/GtZG37Q](https://imgur.com/a/GtZG37Q) The inside video with sound is much better but will remain unshared, sorry.\n\nUPDATE: Thanks for all the awards. I won TIFU of the month! I\u2019ve not seen the women again, and my friend who works in A&E has never seen her either. I hope she is OK. \n\nFor the dozens of you asking about my garden, I did most of the work myself!

All were confined to wheelchairs and had nasty combinations of things like poor motor skills, inability to speak, blindness, deafness, etc. We were encouraged to dress in very covering, loose fitting clothes.\n\nIt's easier to be sympathetic when you try to contextualize\u2014and let me preface this by saying I genuinely care for the children and try to speak about their disabilities in a way that is caring but also cognizant of the blunt reality that things are shitty.\n\nMany of the people we worked with were teenagers with raging hormones and a complete inability to communicate or use their hands for more than motioning. With a lot of things affecting the brain, too, there's often no way to understand concepts like appropriateness and privacy, either.\n\nFor long term residents, they would spend their lives trying to communicate their needs until met. So as children they learned that x combination of grunt and grab would eventually result in that empty stomach feeling being alleviated. When doing activities like crafts, they learned that grabbing at the orange sticker because it's the most attractive to them would get people to stick the sticker on their artwork or wheelchair and maybe bring more orange things. So it makes total sense that living in such a way would eventually develop into things like \"I feel an intense attraction to that boob, I will try to grab it\" or \"I feel a new sensation between my legs and need to touch it, or communicate to this person to touch it for me\" in the same way that caretakers deal with all other bodily functions.\n\nObviously with different levels of cognition there are also different standards\u2014a child like I just described should not be treated as a rapist for grabbing a caretaker's ass, whereas someone on the other end of the spectrum who struggles with impulse control due to ADHD just has to learn you can't go around grabbing asses (and is capable of doing so\u2014that difference in capabilities is the whole point of having mental health defenses). But I like to think my little anecdote is helpful context.",

The next door neighbors had a girl who was a year or two younger than us who had come over to party a couple times. One time, she shows up and is clearly on something. She sat on the couch, put her hands down her pants and started playing with herself. Then she started trying to kiss the guy on the couch with her. He was defending himself for a bit, until her hand came out of her pants and she reached for his face, at which point he jumped up and got away. Idk of that was when she started getting upset or not, but at some point she did start getting frustrated with us telling her that she needed to leave. She also went to the kitchen, grabbed a jar of pickles out of the fridge and started eating them by hand (yeah, that hand), out of the jar. \n\nEventually she was forcefully told she had to leave and suddenly she couldn\u2019t walk. A couple guys walked her home and most of us walked with them. Apparently the mom thought she had been drugged by us and was throwing out rape accusations. Luckily, some of the people there were women and talked to the mom about what happened and she later apologized. Pretty scary shit. Also pretty eye opening for what could have happened if there wouldn\u2019t have been any girls with us.",

Old lady in slippers sort of collapsed against the doorway and asks to come in and sit down. I let her in, sit her down and she tells me she has asthma. I also have asthma if I get a cold or infection, and fetched my inhaler and asked if it was the same as hers. She replies that no, it isn't but a shot of brandy usually makes her right.  \n\n\nI am dubious about this but go and get her a shot of brandy and bring it to her. And another. By this time my then husband comes down and asks what's going on and I explain. He asks her where she lives, but she's determined to get more brandy. He says she can't have any brandy can we phone someone for her? She says no, she's very comfortable here. We explain that we're going to work and so she needs to leave.... She refuses.  \n\n\nJohn helps her up but then she grabs the side of the sofa saying \"Ma name's Bernadette BUT I'm NOT LIKE THE SAINT!\" No shit Sherlock.\n\nJohn had to manhandle her out of the door with her grasping the side of the door, the stair bannister, the edge of the porch etc. She seemed pretty feisty with two large brandies inside her and not at all in need of help. She walked off, feathers ruffled. I was a bit more careful about who I answered the door to, after that.",

You're a better person than me. \n\nA few years ago, a man began aggressively banging on my front door asking/demanding to be let inside because he was cold (it was below freezing outside) but there was no way I was gonna let that guy inside. Instead, I called the police. I informed him of this and he walked away. The police came and searched the area but didn't find him. They suggested he was homeless, and was probably camping in the woods on my property. The next day I walked my property and found several empty beer and energy drink cans plus fast food wrappers where he must have been camping out. \n\nOn one hand, I felt bad (and still do) because he probably was in genuine need and meant no malice. On the other hand, based on his aggressive tone and demeanor, I feel justified in not wanting to let him in my house, especially since my mom lived with me. \n\nIf it happened again, I think I still wouldn't let him in, but I would put some blankets, hand warmers, and warm food outside for him (after asking him to back away).",

It is a very strong lesson in pushing for the state to look after homeless people in\u2014well, in all situations but especially in life-threatening weather.",

So she asked me if I could give her some pants because she didn\u2019t have any. I ran to my bedroom and grabbed some pajama bottoms whose elastic was stretched out enough to fit her and gave them to her. As she put them on I asked her if she was ok, thinking maybe she had just been assaulted or something, but she said no, she\u2019s fine, she just pissed in her pants and didn\u2019t have any others. \n\nThank goodness I was awake, I can\u2019t imagine would have happened if she had walked in while I was sleeping. And I changed my front door lock to the electronic kind that automatically bolts the door so I don\u2019t have to worry about this happening again.",

In my department we've been running just over max capacity for 6 months. Last night we had 25% extra attendance from our baseline due to heat. I'd guess about half of these were preventable (people below 60 falling asleep in full sun or drinking too much. Whether people who got heatstroke at work is preventable by UK law is another discussion to have).\n\nI think saying ambulance service is useless when they're working flat out, still needing full PPE in some cases, is too harsh. There was enough immediately life threatening stuff going on that was being prioritised but yes the whole of emergency services would love to have the extra staff and resources to get to the important stuff on time.",

Category 1 is immediately life threatening (someone collapsing with no pulse or a major trauma) and they aim to get there within 7 mins or 90% within 15mins. Cat 2 is less urgently life threatening, cat 3 is urgent but not necessarily life threatening, cat 4 is not urgent but needs assessment. https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/resource/ambulance-response-times#background has an overview of response changes- globally worse but the hours and hours of increasing waits are cat 4. \n\nThis is because of a mix of resources available (over the years we have lost a lot of beds and have the third fewest hospital beds per 1000 population in Europe), which pressures hospitals into discharging people early as possible increasing risk of bounce back. Staffing in all areas is 20-40% below safe so delays in the department mean ambulances get stuck outside EDs waiting for a space to bring patients in rather than dropping them quickly then going to another job. We also have an aging population so people come for a medical bed when they actually need social support. \n\nI'll end my Ted Talk here but basically standards are deteriorating and it's multifactorial but mostly due to underfunding and stripping of resources with population having increasing needs \n\nIf anybody says \"immigrants\" I will just say Brexit has wrecked our staffing and we're not close to recovering.",

We\u2019re actually moving back home, where it\u2019s a higher altitude and cooler, though not as cool as it used to be and our ski resorts and winter tourism are dying there, and for many other reasons of course, but one of them is because of our pets, specifically our two huskies.\n\nIt\u2019s getting so hot where we live now, just within the last six to seven years, that we cannot keep them here and be sustainable or financially sound, as the electric bill becomes like $300 USD a month, just to keep it cool enough for them.
