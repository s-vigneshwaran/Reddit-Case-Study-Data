If they can pull a hose off the engine, get it to a doorway, and hold onto the nozzle while opening and closing it, that's good enough for us.  Anything more, well, that's why there's a company officer with them, they've been around long enough to know the intricacies of the equipment we work with and the environments we work in.  God forbid things ever start going sideways on a call with these kids, they don't know their asshole from an open butt, and somebody is going to get killed one of these day.\n\nAnyways, same for something as \"simple\" as moderating.  I'm the mod of a couple subs that sounded like they might be a good idea but never really took off, and if I had to handle reports, suspensions, bans, etc on a massive scale, I would be up shit creek.  I'm just smart enough I could probably figure out some automod stuff and try to plug-and play somebody else's scripts, but again, there's a huuuuuge learning curve since I mostly drive trucks, spray water, and work a little construction on the side",

It wouldn't be difficult, so long as it was a number of people working in concert to do so, to convince them that they deserved more and that going on strike would be a worthy way of getting what they are entitled to.

Their narcissism is far stronger than their sense of caution, even if they know what the plan is.",
