  "text": "TIFU By volunteering to research and report back to my (VERY) conservative pro-life family the cause of my grandmother\u2019s mysterious death at the age of 32. She died following an incomplete and (then) illegal abortion in 1958.\nMy paternal grandmother\u2019s death in 1958 at the age of 32 has always been shrouded in mystery.  \n\n\nThroughout the years, there have been various bits of hearsay that have lead to theories and speculation of her dying of the flu, hepatitis, a heart attack, appendicitis, etc.\n\n\nAfter another recent round of speculation at a family gathering, I volunteered to take the lead in researching  the exact cause of her death, if such could be determined.  Further, I offered to report any findings back to all, so as to finally put the speculation and matter to rest. \n\n\nAfter some digging on ancestry.com, I found both her and the actual copy of her death certificate, and which lists \u201cSepsis(?)\u201d and \u201cIncomplete abortion, infected.\u201d as the cause(s) of death. \n\n\nI\u2019ve checked and re-checked the information - it exactly matches her in every category\u2026name, maiden name, DOB, location of birth, address, mother\u2019s name, father\u2019s name, date of death, city / county / state of death, etc. etc. \n\n\nIt\u2019s 100% her.  \n\n\nThis is 100% her death certificate. \n\n\nI\u2019ve included a link to the image of her redacted death certificate both for any who wish to see it, but also to serve as proof of the veracity of my claim and sincerity in posing my question. \n\n\nThe problem is that my family is extremely conservative, very religious, and not unexpectedly, very (VERY) pro-life.  Needless to say, this news will no doubt be extremely upsetting to multiple generations of my immediate and extended family - and which still includes some of her living children, and my aunts and uncle.  \n\n\nWhat if my telling them only further injures my grandmother\u2019s already tragic tale by sullying her memory in the minds of her living relatives?  This is far and away my greatest concern. \n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to say, if anything, or how best to do so.  I\u2019ve sat in this information for a little more than a week, weighing my options on the best path forward.  For their part, they\u2019re all understandably and anxiously waiting and wanting to know what I\u2019ve found, and regularly asking me for updates. \n\n\n\n[Paternal Grandmother\u2019s Death Certificate ](https://i.imgur.com/ZBAquao.jpg)\n\n\n\nTL;DR  Volunteered to research and report back on exact cause of grandmother\u2019s death to VERY conservative / pro-life family (immediate and extended), and discovered that it resulted from an incomplete and (then) illegal abortion.  I\u2019ve now got to figure out whether or not to say anything, and if so, what.\n\nEDIT - Some quick info that might be helpful, by the comments.  \n\nHer family (her, my grandfather, four kids (app. 17, 15, 14 and my father was 9) lived in ~~abstract~~ abject poverty.  They\u2019d regularly skip meals for days until they had enough money to buy more food.  Because my grandfather would not accept help of any kind, my grandmother would sneak garden-grown food given to her by her sisters who lived nearby.  \n\nAll agree that she was very sick and suffered with a high fever for some days before she sought medical attention. \n\n\nEarly into her illness / ailment, her sister found her struggling to do laundry on one of those roll-top machines on the back porch and had to take her inside and put her to bed for fear that she was about to pass out.\n\n\nShe stayed in bed and my grandfather prohibited anyone from entering the room, and he alone saw and spoke to her.  Some believed that he limited contact out of fear that she was somehow contagious. He told the kids and her sisters that she only needed rest. \n\nOn the second or third day, sometime before lunch, an ambulance was summoned to the home.  This was immediately understood to be an extraordinary measure, given its cost.  \n\nOnly my grandfather accompanied her in the ambulance, and urged no one to come to visit her once admitted to the hospital. Instead, he told the older kids to look after the younger in their absence. The sisters of my grandmother, my great aunts, immediately came to be with the children.  \n\nMy father, then age 9 and the youngest child, recalls seeing them wheel his mother out of the house on a gurney, and gently waving to him as she was being placed into the rear of the ambulance.  It was the last time he would see her alive.  \n\nLater that night, my grandfather returned home alone and informed the family that she had died. \n\nAccounts vary, but my grandfather essentially refused to leave their bedroom for a number of days after her death, except to use the outhouse and to attend her funeral services, and which her sisters prepared and arranged, while also caring for the kids.  \n\nDespite remarrying another woman less than a year later, and being married to her for 50+ years, he never moved her clothes and shoes out of their closet, and forbid anyone else from doing so, even until his death in 2010 or so. \n\nMy grandmother\u2019s death had far-reaching implications for her family, essentially fracturing it, and which causes consequences still dealt with today.  \n\nMy father developed a drinking problem a few years after my grandmother\u2019s passing, with such only being greatly accelerated and further exacerbated by a tour in Vietnam, and which lead to his untimely death in the early 90\u2019s.  \n\nIn a very real sense, my children never knew their grandfather because of the tragic events that occurred with my grandmother\u2019s tragic passing.\n\nAlso edited \u201cabstract\u201d for \u201cabject\u201d.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\n\nI have requested an autopsy report from the State Chief Medical Examiner.  Will update if any such report exists, and if so, it\u2019s findings.\n\n**UPDATE 2**\n\n\nThe State Chief Medical Examiner doesn\u2019t have records before 1975.  I am contacting County Coroner on Monday.",

The medical term \u201cabortion\u201d includes both natural miscarriages as well as procedures or medical abortions. Based on my reading of the death certificate and the story, it is most likely she had a spontaneous miscarriage, did not pass the products of conception (fetus/placenta), and those products of conception became infected, which caused her death. \n\nIn a modern world, she would have been seen by her OBGYN, diagnosed with fetal death/miscarriage, and would have undergone a safe sterile procedure to evacuate those products of conception.\n\nI hope this helps.",

What doesn\u2019t happen is someone just adding in \u201cabortion\u201d when there wasn\u2019t one, so I figure that parts true. In 1958 through 2022, few signing death certificates or doing ME paperwork are gonna write what kind of abortion it was, because that\u2019s a great way to get angry phone calls, and angry phone calls means you\u2019re not cutting meat. \n\nIf there was an autopsy, you could maybe tell what had happened relative to the condition of the uterus and the fetus.

Technically speaking incomplete abortion means part of the products of conception have passed naturally, but some didn\u2019t.  A missed abortion is a miscarriage where essentially nothing passes naturally.  Today both are typically treated with a D&C to completely remove everything from the uterus after the baby is known to have died.  This is done to prevent the exact scenario your grandma went through.  I do this procedure regularly (unfortunately) for these indications, and the procedure note will say \u201cincomplete abortion\u201d or \u201cmissed abortion\u201d.  I don\u2019t know what technology was available when your grandmother died, but it is unlikely there was anything close to what can be done today.\n\nThe chances that this represents a botched termination in comparison to the very common miscarriage is, in my opinion, so low that it isn\u2019t worth considering.  Certainly, no where near the level of likelihood that would be worth upsetting an entire family.  I\u2019m not being critical of you OP.  This is just a case of misunderstanding that the term \u201cabortion\u201d is a medical one that is used in multiple situations.",

Meanwhile, mom is dying too, bleeding to death. \n\nThis can of course be avoided by removing the embryo from the fallopian tube before it ruptures. Once it ruptures it becomes an emergency situation to stop the mom from bleeding to death. If it ruptures when she's not close to a hospital, she could die before getting help. Women die from this all the time already, this will now get much worse. \n\nEctopic pregnancies are very common. And particularly common in people with problems like PCOS, of which we see continuous increases in diagnosis. Our planet is full of microplastics, pollution, bad food.. and our bodies are struggling. We also have seen crazy increases in cancer diagnosis in people under 35---prime reproductive years. Colon cancers, bowel cancers, weird brain cancers. More and more pregnant women are being diagnosed with cancer. People are living longer (technically) but we aren't healthier. \n\nForcing someone to die from bleeding out from an embryo that implanted in the wrong place is insane. Want to talk about murder? That's murder. That is cold-blooded murder.",

Missouri is one, I believe. So unfortunately no, several state governments are actively removing even exceptions to save the mother's life. They basically say if the mother dies, it sucks, but oh well. I have a young kid, and I'm someone who even wants more kids, but if I die from an ectopic pregnancy I would leave behind my family, my child.. I am also the breadwinner. My husband would never recover, and he unfortunately has issues himself where if he isn't super careful he could die in his late 40s and our child would be an official foster care orphan. \n\nRoe vs. Wade granted abortion rights until 20 weeks, which is pre-viability. It takes 40 weeks for a normal pregnancy. I don't know the laws of every state, but I have lived in 4 states and none of them allowed the type of abortion you describe, and Roe vs Wade also does not grant access to the type of abortion you describe. So the type of abortion you describe already is illegal everywhere I've lived. \n\nI have known 5 women who had to be saved from ectopic pregnancies. I've known ZERO women who had a full-term abortion. I challenge you to try. Pretend to be seeking an abortion and start calling around. Tell them you are already 37-39 weeks and the baby is healthy but you want to terminate. You will not find a single legal clinic or hospital in the USA that will do that abortion. In my state, all of my research found that you cannot obtain an abortion past 14 weeks, and a few select locations offering up to 18 weeks. None allow past 18 weeks, which is already less than the 20 weeks granted by Roe vs. Wade. However, my state has now passed a law so restrictive, you cannot get abortions, basically. In my particular state so far they haven't outlawed abortions to save mom's life, but they can decide to at any point like Missouri has. \n\nI think the ONLY time they terminate here in the USA beyond 18 or 20 weeks is for conditions completely incompatible with life (mother or fetus life), like when the baby has no brain at all. When I had a baby I asked my doctor about that, because I am a worry wart, and he said about 1 in every 1000 babies has no brain, and it's quite common, and not to feel bad if it happens..... I know definitions of what life is differ, but if you literally have zero brain you are not alive. You cannot be alive without a brain. While in the mother's womb, such fetuses may still seem alive, though. But it is a fool's hope, because they only appear to be alive while the fetus is connected to the placenta. It is a cruel trick of nature, but the baby isn't alive.",

They weren't ready to be parents yet, but they loved each other and wanted children.  They felt an understandable mixture of relief and sadness about the miscarriage. The last thing he needed (she wasn't there so she didn't have to deal with the asshole co-worker) was that anti-choicer getting in his face about a personal matter.\n\nOne of the many reasons why anti-choicers shouldn't be making laws.\n\nIf they really cared about reducing abortions, they'd be advocating for better contraception access, sex ed and increased parental leave, benefits for women having babies etc.  The Handmaid's Tale clownfuckers are all about control.

I've worked in reproductive and maternal health in low- and middle-income countries for many years, including helping set up a system of maternal death reviews ([https://reliefweb.int/report/world/maternal-death-review-guidance-2020-revision](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/maternal-death-review-guidance-2020-revision)). These are important because causes of death are often vague (with terms like \"abortion\" that don't specify spontaneous aka miscarriage or induced) or even deliberately misleading on death certificates, and this is especially true if the person died of something highly stigmatized  in that community like induced abortion complications, HIV,  and COVID recently. Immediate systematic reviews of the cause of death  are the only way to get a real sense of what % of women's deaths are due to unsafe abortion in places where abortion is heavily restricted. \n\nAlso relevant: miscarriages are very common ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532992/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532992/)) , and your grandmother was likely undernourished, which can increase the risk of miscarriage ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5134748/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5134748/) ). So it's entirely possible that she had a miscarriage.  \n\n\nWithout more documentation, you're never going to be able to be 100% sure. I agree with Docdynasty, the death certificate wording can totally mean that this was a miscarriage that was incomplete and got infected. For your situation, might as well go with that.  It's definitely more accurate than the flu or heart attack.",

If the baby dies late in the term I believe they keep a close eye on the mother and either induce labour or wait for it to start naturally.  A stillbirth would follow, a very tragic occurrence.  This has nothing to do with late term abortion. \n\nI think a late term abortion should be limited to cases where the mother is sick or the baby is found to have a serious problem that will make its survival unlikely.    If pro-abortion people insist on allowing unrestricted abortion of a viable fetus (a fetus able to survive outside he womb)   they are going to lose a lot of support.  A healthy mother aborting a healthy baby past about 20 weeks seems creepy as hell.  I'm almost certain that most countries where abortion is legal restrict it to the first trimester, or maybe a little longer, unless there are special circumstances with the mother's or baby's health.  An abortion is also much easier and safer in the first trimester, apart from the weirdness of aborting a baby that could survive outside he womb.",

Your body definitley doesnt prioritize the growing baby, because again what good would that do if the mother, and consequently the baby, die before the mother gives birth?

A lot of the nutrients our bodies need we dont even produce ourselves, and if we do its usually not enough to fully sustain us. It would be nearly impossible for a fetus to take everything it needs from the starving mothers body because her body wouldnt produce most of what it needs. There mightve been some women who have given birth in concetration camps but it is well known that lack of nutrients can cause misccariages so id say theyre the exception not the norm.\n\n\"Malnourished pregnant women run an increased risk of miscarriages and the anguish they cause, along with anemia and even dying during childbirth. Their babies may be born prematurely and, if they survive, suffer from a low birth weight and stunted growth.\"\n\n\"Insufficient vitamin D linked to miscarriage among women with prior pregnancy loss. NIH study suggests the importance of preconception vitamin D in maintaining pregnancy.\"\n\n\"During pregnancy, poor diets lacking in key nutrients \u2013 like iodine, iron, folate, calcium and zinc \u2013 can cause anaemia, pre-eclampsia, haemorrhage and death in mothers.

It was never about babies, fetuses, or murder. It is always about control. They want to control women, and then move on to everything else. Outlawing abortions with broad generalizing language means they can sneak in access to health records for husbands, gaps in privacy laws on everything from period trackers to pregnancy tests, etc. All of this leading to a firm grip by the husband on his wife's anatomy.

I thought sepsis was caused when a fetus had died and all that extra biological material was essentially rotting in the uterus.\n\nThe following inquest answered this question in great detail. \n\n The Ireland and Directorate of Quality and Clinical Care, [\"Health Service Executive: Investigation of Incident 50278\"](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2013/06/savita-halappanavar-hse-report.pdf) is the full report. \n\nThe report detailed that the fetus was still in the amniotic sac but septic. If the amniotic sac ruptured then it would spread that sepsis to the woman. There was advanced care, preemptive antibiotics, advanced monitoring, but .... they just couldn't keep up with how rapidly an infection spreads and the mother is **killed** when in the 2nd trimester the fetus still has a heartbeat but septic and about to rupture.\n\nIt's like doctors saying they can't take care of an infected appendix until it bursts. Nobody who has an inkling of logic or reason forces people to wait until a appendix ruptures (and spreads poisons like wildfire) before they can remove it. \n\nIt was part of why Ireland got rid of their ban on abortion. The report went on to say: \n\n* the law impeded the quality of care.\n\n* other mothers died under similar situations because of the \"fetal heartbeat\" law.\n\n* this kind of situation was **\"inevitable\"** because of how common it was for women in the 2nd trimester to have miscarriages.\n\n* if one was to save mothers and follow evidence-based medicine the main change needed to include changing the law because their evidence-based medical recommendations couldn't be implemented unless the fetal heartbeat law was changed.\n\nQuoting:\n\n> We strongly recommend and advise the clinical professional community, health and social care regulators and the Oireachtas to consider the law including any **necessary constitutional change** and related administrative, legal and clinical guidelines in relation to the management of **inevitable miscarriage in the early second trimester** of a pregnancy including with prolonged rupture of membranes and where the risk to the mother increases with time from the time that membranes are ruptured including the risk of infection and thereby reduce risk of harm up to and including death.\n\nand\n\n> We recognise that such [medical] guidelines must be consistent with applicable law and that **the [medical] guidance so urged may require legal change.**\n\nand\n\n> the patient and her husband were advised of Irish law in relation to this.  At interview the consultant stated \u201cUnder Irish law, if there\u2019s no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, our hands are tied so long as there\u2019s a fetal heart\u201d.  The consultant stated that if risk to the mother was to increase a termination would have been possible, but that it would be based on **actual** risk and not a **theoretical** risk of infection \u201cwe can\u2019t predict who is going to get an infection\u201d.\n\nand\n\n> The investigation team considers that the situation was complicated by the difficulty associated with the application of **the law in Ireland** relating to the termination of a pregnancy.  The investigation team is satisfied that concern about **the law**... **impacted on the exercise of clinical professional \n\nWhen you read the report and all the attempts that staff took to PREEMPTIVELY help with antibiotics made it clear that even that wasn't enough  ...  this woman was killed because of the law forced \"belief\" over scientifically-validated, evidence-based, best-clinical-care medicine practices.\n\n>  **our hands are tied so long as there\u2019s a fetal heart\u201d**\n\nInterestingly, after the investigation from Savita Halippanar's death they found other women had also been killed because of the foetal heartbeat law in Ireland. The national uproar ended up changing the law in Ireland and made abortion legal. Ireland already had one of the best maternal care records in the world. But it got better as Ireland's maternal mortality went to 0 for each year after.\n\n|Year | Maternal Deaths  Per 100k Births: Complications of pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium (O00-O99) | Context\n|--- | ---|---|\n2007  | 2.80  | Abortion Illegal\n2008  | 3.99     | Abortion Illegal\n2009  | 3.97     | Abortion Illegal\n2010  | 1.33     | Abortion Illegal\n2011  | 2.70     | Abortion Illegal\n2012  | 2.79     | Abortion Illegal\n2013  | 4.34     | [Abortion Illegal: Savita Halappanavar's death caused by law and a \"fetal heartbeat\"](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2013/06/savita-halappanavar-hse-report.pdf)\n2014  | 1.49   | Abortion only allowed with mother's health at risk\n2015  | 1.53    | Abortion only allowed with mother's health at risk\n2016  | 6.27    | Abortion only allowed with mother's health at risk\n2017  | 1.62    | Abortion only allowed with mother's health at risk\n2018  | 0   | [Constitutional change Abortion Allowed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44256152)\n2019  | 0 | Abortion Allowed\n2020  | 0 | Abortion Allowed\n\nDeath Data Source: https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/VSD09/JSON-stat/2.0/en Birth Data Source: https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/VSA18/JSON-stat/1.0/en from the Ireland's Public Health records at Ireland's national data archival.    https://www.cso.ie/en/aboutus/whoweare/ and stored at https://Data.gov.ie\n\nNote this is ONLY *mortality* and not also *morbidity* (e.g. kidney failure, hysterectomies, etc.).\n\nIf it was one year it might have been a fluke but it was 3 years running.",

My own great grand father fucked my grandmother, her mom knew but couldn\u2019t leave the bastard because women couldn\u2019t even hold credit in those days. Grandma had to get married at 16 and leave home but her first-husband soon divorced her because obviously she need mental health treatment but he took her first born daughter so she could never see her again in her lifetime. That daughter went on to marry a man who murdered her father. Today I\u2019m just another embodiment of female bitterness and resentment toward the patriarchy.

When I called our insurance rep (we get insurance from the Christian nonprofit where my husband works), she assured me that they would get it sorted out and covered.

Let\u2019s go back to your first comment to me since this is where the argument began. \n\nI\u2019m not saying the grandmother should bear any responsibility for any wrongdoing whether she had a natural abortion or medically induced one. What I\u2019m saying is that due to the family\u2019s conservative background they may find the word \u201cabortion\u201d shocking and think less of her (which they absolutely should not, no matter how it happened; naturally or on purpose).  \n\nThe bottom line is this, none of them know what actually went down. I was trying to relay that message to OP so the terminology doesn\u2019t make them think less of her (again, conservative anti-abortion family we are talking about). I hope that clears things up. \u270c\ud83c\udffb\n\nEdit: I meant to add you\u2019re right, it doesn\u2019t tarnish her image in our eyes, but the family has a much different view on that.",

Over the last decade or two the ultra conservative religious right wing happened.\n\nNow for history of abortion laws in the soviet union. As said harmonized across all states.\n\n\nFirst legalized in 1920 due to many women wanting abortions on account of being unable to raise children due to the famine, war and general unrest.\n\nIt was the. Restricted somewhat by 1924 to having to be before the 4th month of pregnancy, 6 months between abortions and prioritizing women who were deemed too poor, single, or who already had several children as there wasn't enough capacity to meet demand. Did I mention that live in 1920s Russia was trash and not a place were one could reasonably raise children.\n\n Between 1936 and 1955 it was banned, still allowed if the pregnancy endangered the woman's health, with the argument being that they hinder population growth (significantly more relevant due to WW2) accompanied by a host of measures to support families and make being a mother and having a job compatible (implementation was spotty, only kicked in once you had multiple children and only lasted a few years from birth. Meaning it didn't really work). Babki and the like still provided them anyway. The law faced opposition from urban women who argued that raising children massively impacted their ability to further their career, see spotty/bad implementation of family support policies.\n\n\nAnd then it was once again legalized in 1955 with some restrictions for how far along you could be before requiring a medical reason and that it had to be performed in a hospital by a trained doctor. Still accompanied by policies that were supposed to help mothers raise a child and lower abortion rates that way, which didn't work due to the implementation of the policies being rather shit. And that was the last change until the union fell apart.",

She got sepsis because the only treatment would have been abortion, and possibly the removal of her uterus.  Not only wouldn\u2019t they let her get an abortion, they refused to allow her to go elsewhere where she could get one. (She was going to go to England to have it done, but they wouldn\u2019t let her out of the hospital.). Once it became public that she died, and they wouldn\u2019t help her because it would involve an abortion, the protest was quick snd loud.  They had a referendum and it was voted in as law.",

Priest thought they\u2019d dated long enough, and told them to show up for a wedding. They still weren\u2019t sure, but when they didn\u2019t show up, the priest had them remove the kids from the woman - she never got them back. 2 boys went to the priests, the girls went to a convent.  Hired the girls out as maids, but the older one decided to skip work and go to the movies aline. When she got back, they forced her to have a check to see if she was still a virgin, and sent her off to the laundries.  They cut her hair off, changed her name, and forced her to work. Her mom\u2019s sister in America went over to find her and take her to America.  That\u2019s how she got out.  She also took her sister to America, all with her mom\u2019s blessing.

Her father is a fox-news -gobbling conservative asshole. I took him to a United Methodist Church when he visited for Easter because it was nearby and the website was similar to the church he attends in Texas. He said he didn't much care for the service, that they're \"basically holy rollers.\" I've never been to that church (we dropped him off and went for breakfast).\n\nOkay, I lied. The real reason I took him to that church is because I'm passive aggressive with him because I think he's an abusive asshole, and I wanted to stick him in an environment that I knew would challenge his beliefs.\n\nI kinda rambled, but I guess I just needed to get my \"malicious compliance\" story out there.",

In either case, the result must be ratified by 3/4ths of state legislatures before being added to or replacing our current constitution. \n\nIn our current political climate I can't imagine 2/3rds of both houses agreeing on anything, much less 3/4ths of state legislatures. And that's probably good given our current highly polarized society.\n\nFar more likely, in my opinion, is the possibility that the United States will fall apart with different regions going their own way, likely after a protracted period of extreme civil unrest.",

It's bad enough when people have this mentality when they have no insight, but I personally find it notably worse when a woman who actually has the inside point of view, to still behave this way. That's just mind-blowing. How are you going to victim-shame and label other women as murderers or whores, but then say when it happens to you, that it's not your fault? Where do you get the fuel for your denial and hypocrisy? Get off your high horse. You're human just like the rest of us. People make mistakes, people live with their regrets.

For me it's the reverse, it's really easy for me to see and understand large scale issues and their ramifications. My partner is like that, it takes many discussions about large scale events, but it always stays abstract until he sees it concretely played out or someone personally affected talks about it. On the situational aspect I'm terrible at it, when we watch TV half the time I have to ask my partner why people are reacting the way they do, what is going on, because no matter how much I try, I can't see it. For my partner it's clear as day. We both have past trauma that makes one aspect easy and the other aspect difficult.\n\nWe all have different capabilities, and empathy is no different. It's highly influenced by family upbringing, life experience, personal skills and aptitudes and many other factors. Your capacity for understanding and empathize with others is a wonderful quality. And because you possess it, you have the opportunity to try and understand where they are at and the obstacles that prevent them from getting there. It's quite a privilege. I get it, it's not easy to understand and be emphatic those that are intolerant, it takes me ages sometimes to get there, but it's an option you have that they don't and condemning them out like that makes their road even more difficult and breeds negative feelings in you you, it's a rotten deal for every one.",

OP's grandfather may have tried to help her end it because of what it was doing to her, or maybe just wanted to be with her to provide support through a difficult miscarriage. Either way, I suspect the pregnancy was already over and the only question was whether OP's grandmother would survive. \n\nWould she have lived if abortion was legal? My guess is not. For OP's grandmother to have gotten the medical assistance she needed, then: 1) abortion would need to have been legal; 2) abortion would have to have been fully funded by the government so that it was accessible even to people in abject poverty; and 3) OP's grandmother would need to have availed herself of the government funded healthcare despite OP's grandfather's reluctance to accept help. Legal abortion couldn't have hurt, but I don't think it would have been enough, given the circumstances.",

It's a very small minority that are even close to absolute selflessness or absolute selfishness. So really we can only judge people by where they fall on the gradient in between because to expect all of humanity to dedicate themselves to one extreme is unrealistic and unreasonable.\n\nAnd really it does nothing to change the hypocrisy of claiming to be \"pro-life\" when on average the actions, beliefs, and political stance of the person claiming that doesn't reflect that.",

Do you save someone's life if doing so would mean failing to save a different persons life? Is someone evil if they do something evil even if they generally do good? Does one good deed redeem someone who generally does evil? Can you describe yourself as an environmentalist if you've ever driven a car?\n\nIt's just absurd to make everything that a person does that doesn't explicitly align with their stated principles a \"gotcha\" that makes their position inconsistent or their views hypocritical. But what you can do is look at how they *generally* act and see if their actions are *generally* consistent with their stated principles.\n\nAnd the majority of self-proclaimed \"pro-life\" individuals do not generally act in a manner that can be considered \"pro-life\". Which makes it a dishonest label, but it's one they stick with because it produces an emotional response. The same reason why they describe abortion as \"murder\". The language they use is about evoking emotional responses rather than rational ones. Life good. Murder bad. Don't actually think about it, just get angry.\n\nSo yeah we shouldn't enable these people by using their language. Call them \"anti-abortion\" if you want to be civil, and much less polite words if you don't have the patience for it.",

We use certain methods in medicine and I think it\u2019s very helpful for patients as well as for the ones breaking the news (which can be surprisingly difficult). It can also prevent the conversation from going off the rails. Personally, I always start off by asking how much do they want to know. May seem like a weird question, but sometimes people just want to know the bare minimum and you can save them a lot of unwanted burden. \n\nOther times, they want to know everything and so I set the stage so to speak, and let them know that this news may be upsetting or frustrating to hear, but that whatever emotions they feel are totally valid and normal reactions. \n\nHere are some links that are helpful for me when I have to break bad news. I know they\u2019re geared towards physicians, but the methods can still be applied to giving bad news in any setting. \n\nhttps://www.aafp.org/afp/2001/1215/p1975.html\n\nhttps://www.osmosis.org/blog/2021/03/15/breaking-bad-news-using-the-spikes-protocol-vs-the-breaks-protocol",

An abortion is the clinical term for the termination of pregnancy - whether deliberately or through miscarriage. If you haven't found anything that suggests she intentionally had an abortion, it's possible she actually spontaneously miscarried. \n\nFor context, a miscarriage can also result in infection. That's why women nowdays often have to go to the hospital after for a D&C. If any fetal material was left behind because the miscarriage was incomplete it can be very dangerous for the woman.",

The decision to have the abortion in a extremely conservative family is the judgment I'm referencing. If she had seen a proper physician earlier in the pregnancy she might have survived. Also, once she finally saw the physician (once her condition almost certainly deteriorated to a critical stage), there would likely have been resistance to getting the abortion, even though it was apparent that it would be medically necessary. This resistance + delay may have directly contributed to her death. There's speculation involved to be sure, but it all fits.",

Unless you can prove that your grandmother sought to actively end her pregnancy, I would be prone to assume that it was a spontaneous abortion or miscarriage. It is referred to an incomplete miscarriage when the \"products of conception\" (ie the fetus, placenta and all other tissues), are not naturally expelled by the body.  Typically in today's day and age, a woman who seeks medical intervention due to an incomplete miscarriage  By the body not expelling the failed products of conception, this caused the products to essentially decompose inside the body. This then would cause a blood infection or \"sepsis\".  would be taken to the operating room for a D&C ( Dilation and curettage). This is a surgical procedure which dilates the cervix and allows a surgeon to remove tissue that is unwanted in the uterus. If this had been done for your grandmother, she would have been less likley to have  suffered a very bad infection which took her life. \nThere is no shame in a miscarriage.

Both intentional and unintentional abortions (often) require a D&C (dilation and curettage) procedure after a certain point or the mother will die from sepsis as the rotting mass of cells inside her poisons her bloodstream. Clearly, Grandma did not have access to this fundamental abortive procedure and she died. This is what happens when women don't have access to reproductive healthcare. Full stop.\n\nIf you don't want women dying, provide them access to the procedures they need. Without a doubt, even if Grandma suffered a spontaneous abortion of a wanted pregnancy, she died because of draconian laws and cultural attitudes aimed at limiting reproductive healthcare prevented her from getting appropriate care. Anti-abortion laws hurt ALL women, not just ones who want abortions.",

If it is (or just in response to you, if it isn't), I'm not sure that it is in fact in OP's interests to use against their aunts and uncles the story of their deceased mother in the name of a strand of social justice that they likely won't suddenly support. On that point, just as on the original point, we don't know any better than OP. \n\nBut who does know better? The people who have pointed out that it could have been a miscarriage! The people that the comment is so quick to dismiss. Hypocritically. Those are the appropriate comments, and this one could have been appropriate too (I'm no conservative myself!) if it weren't for that strange first sentence (and your strange conclusion from the unpleasant truth presented).",

They believe that women exist solely to give birth so when something interrupts a woman's ability to do that - whether by their choice or happenstance - that woman is now less of a person and needs to be punished.\n\nWhen people advocate for laws forcing a 12 year old to give birth to her rapist's child, or blocking the removal of an ectopic pregnancy that's needed to save a woman's life, when they say that women can't get pregnant from \"legitimate rape\", why would reason and common decency work on them?",

There are still normal pregnancy hormones, blood, resources all being diverted to the fetus even though it's passed on. This stops once the fetus is expelled.

The stress of trying to feed 4 kids, skipping meals, keeping everyone housed and clothed\u2026 it seems to be perfectly reasonable that she might not even have known she was pregnant to begin with. MAYBE she sought out an illegal abortion. But it could have easily been a miscarriage, and just as easy for her to not even know she was pregnant. Grandpa could have also kept it quiet because he sees it as a demonstration of his failure of his ability to provide for his family, and maybe spent the rest of his life living with extreme guilt over both the potential baby and his  wife. There\u2019s just no way to know for sure. If it were me, I might just show it to them and say miscarriages are also categorized as abortions and given the stress she would have been under it seems likely.",

That would also cost money they didn\u2019t have. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the attitude towards all women of the period and culture - some were not even legally persons in 1958, yet. \n\nSo yeah, a sad, complicated story. \n\nOP, I\u2019d tell your family that she died of sepsis, an infection gone wrong. The incomplete truth may be sufficient, if you still feel it would be somehow shameful to add \u201cfrom a miscarriage\u201d.\n\nEdit to fix a word",

Look at the countries that ban abortions - El Salvador, Honduras, Afghanistan, Somalia, etc. Women are forced to give birth in situations of abuse, of poverty, when they are sick, when they are mentally unwell, when they have been raped, when they are surrounded by violence, etc. And those children's brains are trained by and wired in response to those experiences. \n\nForced birth often creates traumatic childhoods. Traumatic childhoods create a lot of adolescent and adult problems, including addiction, crime, and even higher rates of cardiovascular disease and other issues related to systemic inflammation from exposure to toxic stress.

See if any family members are around that were adults during that time and close to her. Ask some gentle questions about her health leading up to it, slip in a question about how you're curious if she wanted more kids at the time. Or try and get someone to get access to her medical records-might be a long shot.",

Whether ot happens on its own or intentionally is actually irrelevant. Still an abortion. Also, it doesn't necessarily have to result in death of the fetus or baby either. A C-Section is *technically* an abortion as well, but you won't generally find people describing it that way for what I assume are obvious reasons.",

Was the dead tissue left behind after the procedure? This may have been a medically required abortion to sustain her life. There is still a lot of context here that is missing. While this may not answer the questions, should put some ease in those people who are so reliant on faith.\n\nGiven her age and that she was married, maybe it is more likely that this was not an elective procedure.

Patients in restrictive states are less likely to seek help out of fear or access, leading to more complications like this.",

I was in middle school and big into the youth group at church. I was a bit of a thorn in the side of my church because I believed that abortion should be allowed for rape victims and when the person carrying the baby's life is at stake, or when the baby is not viable. But I didnt think it should be used for anyone else.\n\n(Spoiler, I've been Pro-Choice since college, which was awhile ago. And nobody has to explain to me why they're getting one.)\n\nAnyways, I was in middle school, and I was talking to my aunt. I had known previously that she had an extremely hard time giving birth to my two cousins. My cousin (her daughter) had increasingly hard deliveries, and almost died delivering her third child. Somehow, abortion came up, and I stated my opinion.\n\nShe then told me about when she had married my uncle (her second husband), and became pregnant. She had two kids by that point and he brought two kids with him, too. So there were four kids in the house. If tmshe carried the baby to term, this would be a child they had together.\n\nBut the doctor had warned her when she gave birth to her second child that the next pregnancy would kill her.\n\nSo there was a few days where my aunt and uncle had to ask if they should tempt fate, or play it safe. And they decided it would be much better to have an abortion and not have my four cousins lose their mom then the alternative.\n\nIn an absolute terrible bit of irony, her body decided for her. She miscarried. So no, she didn't get an abortion, but she was about to.\n\nAnd that moment had a profound effect on me. Here was my aunt, whom I dearly loved, telling me about her own personal experience. If she had gone through with the pregnancy and died, i would have never known her. And it really made me start to think.\n\nHaving a face really helped me start to look at things differently.\n\nSure there's the argument that we should be doing these things without having to put a face to it, but that would dismiss all the hard work people have done to tell their stories. And sometimes, the most important thing is that first step in the right direction.",

      "text": "TLDR - \"incomplete abortion\" *is very unlikely to mean what you think it means*! Please don't tell your family your grandma had a termination. Its far more likely she had a miscarriage, the correct medical term for which is \"abortion\" (the correct medical term for what we call an abortion is a \"termination\") \n\n**************\n\nEhm, someone else has probably mentioned it, but medically speaking - as in, what would be recorded in a death cert - \"incomplete abortion\" DOES NOT NECESSARILY mean (and indeed generally doesn't mean, in my understanding) that it was a human-induced termination. So be very, very, very careful about saying this to your family, because there is absolutely no reason whatsoever, based just on this death cert, to assume it was a termination. \n\nIn medical terms a miscarriage is a \"spontaneous abortion\". A missed or silent miscarriage is an \"incomplete abortion\". It's when the foetus dies but the body doesn't eject it, and it is *extremely* dangerous because the rotting foetus can cause - you guessed it - sepsis. This is why we have D&C, or Dilation and Curettage, to remove the \"retained products of conception\".\n\nGoogle Savita Halappavanar, because this is more or less exactly how she died. She went into critically early labour - basically having a miscarriage - but it didn't progress. She was dilated and most critically her waters broke, which meant her uterus was open to the world, just like it was an open wound. The foetus was dying because of the non-progressing Labour - and in any case was only something like 16 weeks' gestation, so 150% not viable outside the womb - but was not actually dead. There was still a very faint heartbeat. Because of our (Ireland's) fucked up and uncertain laws at the time (equal right to life of mother and foetus), doctors were afraid to give anything to actually kill the foetus, or to bring about contractions or anything, even though the acknowledged and only treatment for a septic uterus is to end the pregnancy. But they kept expecting the foetal heartbeat to stop because by all rights it absolutely should have.\n\nBut even if it hadn't, the pregnancy was no longer viable. The waters had broken, there was no way of plugging Savita up to let gestation continue - she was literally miscarrying, it had just stalled.\n\nAnd then, because her womb was open to the air, she contracted a uterine infection, which developed into sepsis.\n\nThe worst thing though was that the bloody signs of infection and sepsis were missed. If that had been noted even something like 6 hours earlier, 1) she'd have been given antibiotics but 2) at that stage the mother's life is in imminent danger so even our old laws would allow for termination. But by the time it was realised, she was in systemic organ failure IIRC.\n\nSo honestly, based on what you've written here, while it is definitely *possible* that your grandmother accessed some help for a termination, it is IMO far more likely that she had an incomplete miscarriage, the foetus wasn't ejected and that caused an infection. Also because on a medical certificate, especially back then when formal language would be much more likely to be used, they wouldn't use the term \"abortion\" if they meant \"termination\". In medical terms the two things *are not the same*, regardless of modern usage. If you see \"abortion\" on a medical cert it generally means a miscarriage. If they meant a termination it would say termination.",

You can love someone and disagree with their choices and actions, I hope your family would not think less of your grandmother but instead have a greater appreciation for the struggles she went through. Imagine her despair knowing she was about to have another child when her current ones were already hungry? The fear she must have felt getting the procedure done, the pain and suffering she endured for the sake of her kids. \n\nPutting a real person in the shoes of this issue, especially someone they loved, could certainly be a struggle for them. But I don't think it is your responsibility to shield them from reality. I think following the previous advice on breaking it to them gently is good, but as far as not telling them at all- it is not your job to protect them from what could harm their beliefs. I cannot speak for your grandmother, but I would think she would want her family to know she loves them and clearly did what she thought was the best thing for them. I would imagine she would be disappointed if they thought less of her for her sacrifice to help her children.",

There is also an entire season (8) which revolves around illegal abortions and complications / deaths from resultant infections, although that might be a little close to home. \n\nI'm not sure if it would be something you're interested in, but all the women are portrayed with kindness and by most accounts pretty accurately, so it might help you understand what your grandmother went through, and how she ended up in that position.",

The fuller story suggests that, perhaps, your grandmother was in early stages of pregnancy, her body had tried to spontaneously abort, and that led to sepsis and her death. Your grandfather perhaps knew what was going on, treated the event as serious and private, and forbade others from knowing. \n\nI consider spontaneous abortion more likely than an intended abortion in this case because of the use of the term \"incomplete abortion.\" Even today, that refers to a kind of early pregnancy miscarriage ([MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001488.htm)), and it would have been dangerous back then precisely because of the risk of sepsis. According to this [1939 guide on listing causes of death](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Manual_of_the_International_List_of_Caus/ivKMbZFF4qEC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22incomplete+abortion%22&pg=RA1-PA48&printsec=frontcover), \"Incomplete abortion\" was considered 141d, \"Abortion (spontaneous, therapeutic, or of unspecified origin) (without mention of hemorrhage, trauma or shock, or toxemia\", and distinct from self-induced abortion (141e). \n\nI know that \"abortion\" is such a touchy term because people see it and assume a self-induced abortion, but this story touches instead on the different, distinct taboo of miscarriage. It's still a tragedy, in particular that your grandfather felt he had to keep it secret.",

I\u2019ve been cut off from my family for a variety of reasons (for some it was my gayness for others it was my autism/ADHD/mental illness, for some it was my apparent behaviour when in an abusive relationship) so I know that family loyalty is flexible. But when one relative almost died because of mental health issues related to being in the closet the family realised they\u2019d rather have living gay family than otherwise. And at that point the family that had ostracised me for being bi/gay came around (at least on that score).\n\nI don\u2019t know. I just think they have a right to know. Even if it hurts.

My mom didn't talk much about it, but it always seemed to me that she blamed him performing the procedure on a litany of other traumatic events in her and her family's life.  My understanding is that all of them knew.\n\nI only knew him as a kind (if occasionally stern) and caring man, but apparently during the 60s and 70s he struggled with depression and substance abuse. To the point where he had the means set aside to end his life.\n\nHe was also a Navy surgeon during the later portion of Korea and the early part of Vietnam, so I could not tell you if it was abortions or stitching marines back together that broke him. He got better, at least to the grandkids he lived long enough to meet.\n\nThis is still an open secret in the family, and I think it is something that still fractures the extended portion of it more than a bit. Tell the truth to your family, it cannot make things worse. It took me a long time to adjust from a categorically anti-abortion stance to acknowledging even the occasional necessity for the procedure.\n\nEdited for spelling and clarity.",

Because I was 5, they couldn\u2019t explain that to me, and it was a source of confusion for me when it happened as they explained it as a still birth but I didn\u2019t really understand what that meant. \n\nWhen I became an adult, my mum told me what had really happened, and suddenly things made a lot more sense. More than anything, I was so grateful that she had made one of the hardest decisions anyone can make based on her love and dreams for me and my future. It\u2019s hard to think of a stronger expression of love than that, going through an extremely traumatic experience to make things better for your child. If your grandmother did in fact elect to terminate her pregnancy (as opposed to having a miscarriage that was classified as a spontaneous abortion), she did it for her 4 existing children, your father and aunts/uncles, to have enough food to go around that they wouldn\u2019t starve. She died for them, and if you do decide to tell your family, I hope you will emphasise that, because she does not deserve to be demonised for making what she thought was the best decision for her (your) family.",

I personally would find it especially important to do so if the people I would be telling are lioely to be in favor of policies that would force other women, other families, to suffer similarly. Perhaps it will get through to some of them; perhaps not.\n\nBy the sound of it, your grandfather knew to some extent what had happened, perhaps even encouraged the procedure, and the result destroyed him. Make it clear that anybody who would shame her memory for this should themselves be ashamed. If their opposition to abortion or their shaming her is in any way religious, (I'm assuming Christian,) they need to know that they are very bad Christians.\n\nThe truth is, just about every family has a variation on this story, and every woman who was alive in the pre-Roe era knows a woman who was either horribly injured or died. My grandmother, for instance, was friends with a girl in high school. At some point that girl got pregnant, and after what must have been a thoroughly agonizing decision, that girl secretly went to some shady place in downtown Detroit. She died as a result. My grandmother was raised Catholic by German and Polish parents, and she has been staunchly pro-choice ever since this happened. She has told me that even though she does not like the idea of abortion in the abstract, she cannot believe that any woman should ever have to go through what her friend did.\n\nThe silence of the women who suffered, and the ignorance of their stories, is what allows people who would want them to suffer to gain support; it strengthens the system that perpetuates the suffering.",

Every teaching hospital has old MD's, emeritus professors that stay around after retirement to teach medical students etc.    \n The term \"incomplete abortion\" does not imply a mechanism of how that pregnancy came to an end.  What I am trying to say is that your grandmother's story is exactly how an illegal abortion would have entered into the medical record during the time.  Your grandmother was young, and early in her pregnancy (people did not know she was pregnant).  It would be very rare for a miscarriage in the first trimester to end in sepsis.  Uterine contents are essentially sterile, and early pregnancy loss is usually just like a heavy period.  Blood loss during menses almost never spontaneously results in ascending infection.  Retained products of conception (which are not uncommon) are usually mummified and absorbed.  It was the illegal abortion that contaminates the uterus and causes the infection that leads to sepsis.  How do you think that the coat hanger became an internationally recognized symbol of deadly illegal abortion?  The act of pushing the end of a wire into the uterus to rupture the gestational sac seeds the uterine cavity with bacteria.  And think about it, why did so many young women having \"sepsis... incomplete abortion...\"  not present until they were almost dead?  It was the fact that they were having illegal abortions that made them not seek medical care until it was too late.  It is almost unheard of in the present era for young women to be hospitalized with \"sepsis...incomplete abortion...\".  Before Roe, they literally had hospital wards filled with nothing but these women.\n\nWith Roe being put down we are going to see more and more of this.  I am taking the time to write all this because I saw people trying to change your mind.  Your grandmother's story is exactly what we will be seeing in the near future.",

You would be doing a great disservice to your grandmother's memory by letting your family go on judging her and women like her, denying them life saving medical care. They are the same people who forced your grandmother into this position and cost her her life. Are their beliefs worth it now? Did grama deserve that?  At a time such as now, such a tumultuous and meaningful time for women's healthcare, you learned this information. I think the best thing to do is share the truth, and i sincerely hope that's what you do - and important conversations that lead people out of the dark occur thereafter. If it were regarded simply as health care, your grandmother might still be alive today. Everyone's lives could have been profoundly different. Your life could have been very, very different.  The smaller and smaller the number of families this happens to, the better we all will be. Please help your family members come to some understanding of what this kind of thinking does to families. What it did to your family.",

From a medical point of view, which is the perspective from which this was written, this reads as an incomplete miscarriage that wasn\u2019t managed quickly enough and sadly led to serious infection and sepsis and cost your grandma her life. You can read it as an illegal abortion that went wrong, but I suspect it wasn\u2019t. Miscarriage was (and still can be) quite dangerous. I\u2019d report this to family as septicaemia from an incomplete miscarriage. Medical care was, and is, expensive and you mention their poverty so I think it\u2019s very likely she assumed she had the flu or something she could get over without a doctor and unfortunately delayed treatment until it was too late. She may well have hidden the pregnancy from family as it was early and have been ashamed to tell her husband about the miscarriage- it was an incredibly taboo subject back then.",

Unfortunately, where ever she went (OP were you able to find any of that out?) did a shit job. It could've been the neighborhood midwife for all we know.  \nThis is why abortion became ILLEGAL in the first place 100 or so years ago. Too many men were being left with a gaggle of children after their wives would have an failed abortion. It wasn't their job to look after children. So many children wound up abandoned, put into orphanages, sent away as a result. This contributed greatly to generational dysfunction in families. This was also WHY R v. W became legal at the Supreme Court level 50 years ago. It was to save the life of childbearing aged women. Society was different then.  \nI am sorry for your grandmother, OP, that happened to her, and sorry for her children, and other relatives.  \nRegarding your family---it was 1958 and they were poor. GrM couldn't deal with having another mouth to feed and did what she did. Just tell them that. It's not on you how they respond. If their religion can't handle it. If they're in denial and want proof and you're willing to share copies of the D.C., so be it. You may get grief and be temporarily shunned till they come to gripes with it all. Just be factual.",

Put together some sort of presentation or video for your family focussing on your grandmother/grandparents and highlight their hard work and struggles. Most importantly your grandmother was a person, not just a mother or the victim of a failed abortion.\n\nWhile you will never know your grandmother's exact reason for seeking abortion it's probably pretty safe to assume that they were not in a position to care for another surprise pregnancy. They were no strangers to the burden another child would place on them. I'm also thinking your grandfather encouraged her to seek an abortion or at the very least been told at the hospital. He seemed to feel immense guilt from what your grandmother went through.\n\nThis is your grandmother's story. Since she's not here to tell it, do some digging to see how life was during this time. What would her options have been? What did their struggles mean? Ect ect\n\nOverall, you are not responsible for the feelings of your family. Good luck OP",

They stayed at a few different places and apparently she had hid from everyone that she had gotten pregnant after her husband died in the service by a foreign service member who was training in the US. \n\nShe had found a DR who would deliver the baby for free and put it up for adoption somewhere in Arizona. Of course they doped her up to give birth and the baby was a still birth but they wouldn't let her see it and said they already buried it after a couple of hours. Her mom believes they just wanted to cheat her out of the compensation for all of this stuff for the adoption. Family members after the birth came and picked up my MIL and her brother and took them to disneyland which was a newish thing back then and pretty much that is most of what they remember. They think they have a half brother out there somewhere but have literally no info to go on since her mom wanted to just forget and don't have anything except the name of the little town the dr was from. \n\nWomen get victimized because of unwanted births and I just can't see a way to fix this that is even possible at this point",

All she could remember was there was something \u201codd about the circumstances of his death\u201d and being in the 1950s in England, the family never talked about it again.\n\nUk death certificates aren\u2019t available online like the US ones are and I had to dig really deeply to find anything.  A big step was unlocked when I came across his name in the National Archives, a large file that will remain closed for another 50 years.  There was enough information to see that it was a court case involving the murder of a lady.\n\nFinally I was able to search newspapers and found out that he was implicated in the murder of his lodging house owner.  But before he could be arrested he committed suicide.  It was a scandal in the papers for weeks.  Later a former partner of this lady was found to have been her murderer (but it was quite a while after so the family would have concluded that he was a murderer).\n\nI thought for a long time how to gradually and gently introduce the information to my cousin - obviously a long time had passed and she was already bracing for something awful.  I left it to her to pass on the news to the rest of her family.  \n\nMaybe in your case, choose one of the more moderate relatives and have a quiet conversation rather than sitting everyone down to a big reveal - especially if you are concerned how they may react.  It will be easier to manage one person\u2019s emotions and you can gauge their response.  Hope it goes well for you.",

I think in this situation you can only act as honorably to yourself in what you set out to achieve, as that's the responsibility you've created for yourself in this moment. But the reactions of others to this news is no more your responsibility than if they'd taken the same steps themselves and found out this information independently of your involvement; it is what it is, it's the truth, and how they handle or react it is their responsibility.",

For some people, though, that ambiguity could make it worse.\n\nThis is a bit like those genetic ancestry testing things you hear about.

      "text": "\n\nOP first off sorry for the long post and the circular thinking that comes out in my writing, I'm autistic I srsly don't realize I'm doing it it's just how I communicate. \n\nAnyways if you see this will you pls update everyone? Im so interested in knowing some things. Did your grandfather know? Do you think he wasn't letting anyone in the room because he knew what was wrong and didn't want to tell anyone? There's so many questions. It sucks you have no other records especially hospital care records, because it could have been a perfectly healthy pregnancy that turned bad and she was delivering a dead baby so it was already septic(they had to call an ambulance the fetus must have died in utero and then sepsis set in?) How did they know the baby was alive when they did the \"abortion\" to call it an abortion? Why didn't they consider the baby died in child birth? How long was she in hospital for and did she become septic after the \"abortion\". If the ambulance took her to an actual hospital surely no doctor there at that time did an abortion because of the laws back then so why did they word it like that? Did she try to do it herself at home and that's why the ambulance was called? I doubt it.  Policeay have come round your grandfather's house had she done that to herself yeh? Maybe it's different depending on where you live and the local police and how they are. \n\nI would say talk to a therapist about this but your family wants answers now and don't know any of this and if you go to a therapist and aren't telling family what you found out they'll wonder what's going that you need therapy before you can even talk to them about it...... \n\nI think the best thing to do is to remind them all it was a different time back then and no one has any answers really since your dad kept everyone away from her only he really knows right? So maybe talk to your family and tell them what you learned will be hard to hear if they can't keep an open mind about medicine back during that time. It's possible she didn't know she was pregnant or it was an ectopic (that means anywhere outside the uterus not just the tubes) and if her death certificate says sepsis I would think the child surely had to have died in utero unless she became ill with sepsis after the procedure(which they may have been doing to save her life) and it wasn't sanitary by today's standards then sepsis set in? I think your family should know that there probably is a reason why none of them knew how she died but I think your grandfather most likely did and just didn't tell anyone. He never let anyone move her clothes or shoes so I don't think this is something malicious or bad like she had an affair and got pregnant or she didn't want another child or  she tried to self abort at home(BUT you've said nothing to indicate this or that they would do this and I doubt this but no one knows, you just make it seem like your grandmother and grandfather would never willingly abort any of their children.) \n\nSeems like your grandfather remarried so he would have a partner for his children(I've told my husband to pls remarry if I die and find someone who is leaps and bounds better than me for our children) so I'm sure back during that time a single father wasn't really a thing they would certainly remarry, but it sounds like he still very much stayed in love with your grandmother. So I think the death certificate and the way it's worded will shock your family and cause a million questions(I have a million surely your family will have more) but no one really knows the circumstances and it's not fair to assume the worst when she isn't here to defend herself. Tell your family to try and not apply modern day thinking(Evangelical style crazy style no offense) but to try and keep an open mind it's not for them to judge, and if it helps tell them God is the creator of all man kind, who are you to elevate yourself to that od your god your creator to judge his creation for him.(I tell this to my own family they are Muslim so the judgement in our family can be harsh)  You have the cause of death but no real answers surrounding it and what led to it, no medical records I'm guessing to see what care she received or any baby she might have tried to deliver. If abortion was illegal and it was listed on her certificate and her husband was there would authorities come round to ask him questions? Not sure how they handled it back then. \n\nI would tell your family that this will be difficult to hear but that no one knows the circumstances leading up to her death or what they did to her in the hospital. The abortion label alone shouldn't tarnish your grandmother's life. The people who knew her and loved her seemed shocked at her sudden death and had no answers but your grandfather must have known bc of the death certificate and even still he kept her things in the closet not to be touched. \n\nIt very well could be that she learned she was pregnant and there was already a problem leading to fetal death which caused her to become septic something not many people live through especially back then. I'm sure the doctors realized she was pregnant and maybe upon examination her body was in the process of aborting and they had to help her deliver the child. That is total speculation from me my point is your family needs to understand you'll never know all the answers and this doesn't make her a bad person, your grandfather most likely knew and still held her things so he wasn't angry or bitter about her maybe getting an \"illegal\" abortion and wouldn't it say illegal on the death certificate? \n\nAlso your grandfather was with her alone for 3 days? Who knows what they spoke about and kept between themselves, who knows how sick she was I mean if she stared off in bed and ended with an ambulance ride and died of sepsis I really think her fetus was already dead sadly. I mean that's just how sepsis works. I suppose she could have became septic from something else and I don't even want to type this but I doubt very seriously her and your grandfather tried at home to self abort and failed. Surely there would have been a mess and everyone would have known in the house? No amount of whiskey is going to make it not hurt if a woman does a self abortion the way they did it back then. Sorry for the circular talking I'm sure it's happening I just have soanu questions. It's possible she became septic after an unsanitary delivery of a stillborn? I'm guessing your grandfather wasn't in the room and she came in by ambulance surely they had no idea what exactly to expect or modern science to help them but I'm sure they tried to save her life and things weren't as sanitary back then as they are now, that could have caused sepsis. How long was she in hospital for before she died? My brother died of sepsis but mainly his heart lining became infected and it was from a dirty needle. So he used and within 15 hours he died from sepsis so it happens fast. I have so many questions about Al this. \n\nSorry for the rambling at the end of the day you have the answer but you also have no answers. There are still too many questions for your family to tarnish her memory bc of what her death certificate says. To automatically assume the worst in this situation bc of how religious they are now would be wrong(and no offense Christianity and extremism have been holding hands for a few years now in a way I've never seen before). The members of your family have life because of your grandmother, they have their own children because of her, they can't learn something new but shocking and then hate her and maybe even your grandfather and then destroy her image forever bc of a piece of paper with a cause of death that leaves way more questions than answers. \n\nThose answers may have died with your grandfather.",

They might be able to give a perspective you can't see because you're so close. In the end, only you can decide what you'll do. The way I see it, your family asked for an answer. They didn't ask for an easy-to-digest-answer, they just want to know what really happened. You took on the responsibility of finding out, not the responsibility of deciding if your family would be able to handle the truth. I also personally believe they deserve the truth, and they deserve the chance to have their reaction to learning the truth. If you withhold this from them, you aren't even giving them the chance to respond to it, some might surprise you. It would also require you to keep lying to your family for the rest of your life about this, and I don't think you deserve to carry that burden, especially since they wanted to find out the truth about what happened. \n\nYou know your family, and yourself, so you are the only one that can make this decision in the end. For what it's worth, I would want to know, even if this family member went against one of my core beliefs, and I would've told my family, because the importance and the value of truth isn't based on how easy it is to hear. \n\nI would recommend you make sure that the vulnerable people have a support system to go to after you tell them, make sure there isn't alcohol at the get-together when you tell them (if that's applicable) and to make sure to check in or make others check in a bit more often with certain family members in the weeks afterwards. \n\nWhatever you decide, good luck, and kudos for how compassionately and diligently you are handling this.",

So,  your family might already know.",

Given the \"[abject] poverty\" the family was in, the number of children at the time, the secrecy surrounding grandpa wanting to be alone with grandma, and the extraordiariness of the ambulance, I'm tempted to lean towards thinking the grandpa may have discovered the pregnancy and feared even worse conditions for his family, and influenced, if not pushed, grandma into receiving an abortion. The anti-abortion sentimentality in the family may have resulted from this event, and from the sound of alcoholism later on coupled with grandpa's refusal to let his deceased wife's belongings be moved nudges me towards believing he carried some guilt for what happened then. \n\nI mean even though it's illegal then, it seems strange to list \"abortion\" as the cause of death if it was meant to be kept secret from everyone and anyone, instead of \"miscarriage\" or other listed cause. The official status of it sounds much like it was approved by all involved, but that's harder to determine.\n\nWhatever the case, the number of questions you get from curious family might exceed your expectations. Its a good idea to ask yourself everything you'd want to know before approaching your family. Good luck, chief.",

          "text": "Abortion in medical terminology does not always mean a voluntary termination of pregnancy.\n\nMiscarriages are also called \"spontaneous abortion\" because the body naturally aborts the fetus when the fetus dies. It is wholly possible that the mother had a natural miscarriage and her body failed to abort the fetus naturally and that lead to an infection. She may have not even known she was pregnant.\n\nJust wanted to point out that \"incomplete abortion\" doesn't necessarily mean that there was a voluntary termination of the pregnancy. It could just mean that she had a miscarriage and the body didn't properly abort the fetus and the decaying tissue lead to sepsis.",
