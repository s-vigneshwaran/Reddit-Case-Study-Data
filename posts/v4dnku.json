Re-cementing a crown that took so much tooth structure with it is likely a short term fix (if it's even possible), but a lot of people do it for cost reasons. The more reliable alternatives are much more expensive (like tenfold or more).",

Despite the fact that the defendant remained silent for nearly three hours during the police interrogation before answering a few questions towards the end, the Court ruled that he failed to invoke his right to remain silent because he did not actually state that he wanted to remain silent. The mere act of remaining silent on its own was insufficient to establish that the suspect invoked the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent. The Court reasoned that mere silence is ambiguous because the suspect might be taking the time to think of a good explanation or to consider options before speaking.\n\nhttps://versustexas.com/blog/miranda-right-to-remain-silent/",

The cops here decoupled *Miranda* rights from one another, which makes no sense logically.  Taken to the extreme, this ruling appears to allow authorities free reign to violate the Eighth Amendment: \"Sure, we've held him in our county lockup for two years without trial, your honor, but he wouldn't tell us anything, even that he wanted to *not* tell us anything!  We just assumed he was taking a reeeeeeeeaaaaallllllly long time to contemplate our first question!\"\n\nWhatever this defendant said after they sweated him for three hours without counsel should indeed have been given \"backsies,\" because it was essentially coerced.  Otherwise, the standard *Miranda* warning isn't even enough and needs amended: \"You have the right to remain silent.  If you choose to invoke that right, you must affirmative do so by stating, counterintuitively, 'I invoke my right to remain silent.' ACTUALLY remaining silent, e.g. the right we're telling you you have, is NOT a right until you claim it by doing the opposite.\"",

Joe Barton, R-Texas, who, according to the claim, once said, \"Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up.\"\n\nApparently he didn't actually say that, but what he actually said was something including \"\u2018Wind energy is a finite resource. At large scale, slowing down the wind by using its energy to turn turbines has environmental consequences. A group of researchers at Princeton University \u2026 found that wind farms may change the mixing of air near the surface, drying the soil near the site.\" \n\nSo, as usual, there's a grain of truth in the nonsense... just a little dash of actual science in there, but they're still morons who don't understand what they're talking about.",

I let her talk.  she told me that the US needs to ally with Putin because Putin already controls Trump, Desantis, Murdoch, the GOP media and most GIOP congressmen and senators. She said that is a good thing because Russia under Putin would be a great ally for the US. She also told me Trump had won in 2020 and Biden was not legit so he must be overthrown ASAP and then the US can be friends with Putin (and Xi by extension) and be even more powerful and dominant.  She also lied that Russia has free press, free speech, free elections and that they laugh at sanctions and think Biden is a weak old man. She also told me the old USSR belongs to Russia and unifying the old USSR would be a great thing.  That was before the Ukraine invasion.  So to my Republican friends, I ask you, assuming Putin really does control your party and media now, is that really something you want to be part of?   I say vote democrat 100% no matter what for the next 3 years, even if you dont like the dem candidate vote for him anyway because this is the alternative. Btw my Russian neighbor figured out I am not a Putin supporter and now she wont speak to me and looks terrified whenever she sees me, because she knows she talked too much. I believe she is an Russian agent, one many many especially in Florida which is Putin central. used to be trump Tower NYC now it is Mar a Lago.",

They buy other people so they can install they're shitty regimes and make more conflicts and get money. Yet we're totally going with it. It's like no one realises that political party's are just a joke at this point. they're all the same, you can compare to religions, they may look like they're doing something good right? But really they're fueling death and taking your money to go touch children at Epstein's island (which the FBI decides not to release the names of the suspects involved). They're literally saying to our faces, hey! Your government is full of old vegetable corrupt assholes and no one cares. It feels like the school shooters have bigger balls than even republican gun owners even though they're motives are completely shit. If there's nothing stopping a school shooter to shoot children than what's stopping the people to shoot up congress to get what they want? No, but the only time it's okay to revolt and burn down your local Walmart is if a drugged up black person gets wrongfully killed. 19 children aren't ever gonna be enough. Yeah I'm done, this countries in peak clownville at this point, its truly lost. I'm just thankful to God rn I was given the opportunity to get out.",

The answer to what we need to do needs to come from someone far more intelligent than I am, but one thing I do know that we need to do is stop saying this is ok. Stop believing everything we hear and apply logic to it. \n\nCommunication is not the same as 10 years ago. Yes we have the same social media sites and whatnot but things have been evolving ever since. Even if it wasn\u2019t, 10 years is not a long time (if you think it is you are just proving the tunnel vision I accused you of in my previous comment).\n\nYour comments are so full of emotion, exaggeration, and ignorance. I don\u2019t mean to say that as an insult (but I do admit I\u2019m not friendly). The reason I bring it up is that you\u2019re showing a lack of understanding for history and time. Governments change all the time, ours has been called the same thing but is not the same as it was when it started. I\u2019m not even suggesting we change it, I\u2019m just saying we modify it. There\u2019s a lot of bad shit out there but staying in an echo chamber is toxic and makes you chase after a boogeyman when the real bad is far more complicated and not so black and white.

But plenty of them are shitting on people like Pelosi and her stock nonsense. Many posts are just about decisions that aren\u2019t directly tied to one party or the other. And no, you did not get banned just for saying something negative about liberals. You most likely got banned for repeated offenses of the same rule violation, which might have been the civility rule. It\u2019s pretty rare they just ban someone over one thing. I\u2019ve had multiple temp bans from there but am not banned. \n\nWithin any given post there will be many different opinions, and just because people are critical of the GOP does not mean they aren\u2019t also critical of democrats. Just because something is posted does not mean that every top comment is saying the same thing. \n\nNow r/conservative, on the other hand, WILL happily ban people after a single rule breaking report if it doesn\u2019t fit with the current narrative. I\u2019m banned there for breaking the civility clause when I replied to a non flaired user comment of \u201cliberalism is a disease of the mind\u201d with my own \u201cconservatism is a disease of the mind.\u201d  Both of us said the same childish thing. I got banned for being uncivil, they got made a flaired user. It is certainly not \u201cthe only page that says anything critical about liberals.\u201d  They also love to accuse each other being fake conservatives and can\u2019t imagine that someone might have a different opinion on their team. It\u2019s hilarious seeing someone with 2 downvotes make the inevitable claim they\u2019re being BrIgAdEd!\n\nNot sorry to say this, but buddy, it turns out a majority of people don\u2019t like conservative ideas that much in this day and age. Which is why the GOP is a minority party and are actively trying to make it harder to vote them out with regressive voting laws and unconstitutional gerrymandering. \n\n(Who are you talking to?)",

Democratic socialism focuses more on providing basic needs to all people, such as health care and education. Democratic socialism, unlike socialism, would achieve this through democratic means and not an authoritarian rule.\n\nNone of this has anything to do with whether Dems and QOPs are \"both bad\" and in any case, I'm listening for your brilliant plan to get us out of the two-party system.

Trump\n\n> Using the powers of his high office, President Trump solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, in the 2020 United States Presidential election. He did so through a scheme or course of conduct that included soliciting the Government of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations that would benefit his reelection, harm the election prospects of a political opponent, and influence the 2020 United States Presidential election to his advantage. President Trump also sought to pressure the Government of Ukraine to take these steps by conditioning official United States Government acts of significant value to Ukraine on its public announcement of the investigations. President Trump engaged in this scheme or course of conduct for corrupt purposes in pursuit of personal political benefit. In so doing, President Trump used the powers of the Presidency in a manner that compromised the national security of the United States and undermined the integrity of the United States democratic process. He thus ignored and injured the interests of the Nation.",

The problem is because some of you hate Republicans, you refuse to see the rampant lying that Democrats have done and are doing.\n\nI don't like politicians but even I have to say things under Trump were better and much less expensive.  I don't care what your reason is(outside of an electric vehicle), you would have to be a dolt to be ok with paying $6 per gallon at the pump.  Does that mean I like him as president when he was?  Nope.  Would I vote for Trump if he runs again?  Nope.  He lost his balls and became a politician.  \n\nTrump gave me some hope because I don't want politicians to become presidents.  But then he took it away when he became a politician.  Tbh, I have no hope in the next presidential election.  It's going to take more than just the president to get us out of the deep hole we dug ourselves into as a nation.  That means people, business owners, and politicians alike.",
