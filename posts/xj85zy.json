So, now he's in that \"I'm agnostic\" phase on his way to the truth any year now. \n\nSo, for all the horror stories we hear daily about the evangelical kooks, I thought I'd share a positive story of one (always decent) old man finally reaching enlightenment through his own person journey. :)",

Televangelists) are by far the most passionate about Trump and the theocratic Fascist ideology he seems to embrace. \n\nI think that's because they see it as a great way to maintain their power at a time of declining religious attendance/belief throughout the country and siphon tons of money from their followers in the process. This definitely was amplified by Covid where you saw lots of preachers who didn't care about the health and well-being of their followers demanding that they do everything possible to fight against quarantine rules and show up for church in person no matter the health risks (which I'm sure totally didn't have anything to do with making sure the church kept getting the tax free, largely untraceable cash donations they were used to receiving every Sunday). It shouldn't be a shocker that many of these churches that demanded people show up and couldn't be bothered to temporarily conduct services online due to the risk of losing members/donation money seem to be heavily aligned with Trumpism despite all the supposed rules out there about expressing political opinions at the pulpit.\n\nOn the flipside though, this type of reactionary backlash seems to have happened before in places like Europe and led to a rapid decline in religion in the long run after periods such as WWII. Lots of these religious institutions pinned their hopes of survival on far-right fascist ideology but ultimately were abandoned by much of the population. Hopefully, we will see the same thing happen here if we're lucky...",

If you truly believe abortion is murder then it\u2019s *always* murder and should be treated as such. Let\u2019s take their assumption that from conception forward a zygote/fetus is a human life murdered by abortion. I\u2019m going to speak next like I\u2019m one of these asshole zealots.\n\nIt follows that *all abortions or actions that purposefully cause abortions are murder and should be treated as such.* Anyone involved in a murder should be tried and punished: the mother, doctors, nurses, drivers to the crime scene\u2026just like for any other murder. Trial and jail.\n\nPregnant by rape or incest? No abortion. Why should you be allowed to murder a baby based on the manner of conception? Your fetus is malformed and perhaps cannot survive outside the womb? No abortion. It\u2019s murder and that baby deserves every chance of trying to survive after birth. It doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019d suffer for years with disabilities because we can\u2019t go murdering people just for being disabled. IVF culling? Murder. Those babies should all have a chance to survive. Mother could die? Oh well, not an excuse to murder a baby. Your religion says it\u2019s okay? Well, we don\u2019t let your religion tell you you can beat or rob people so it can\u2019t tell you to murder a baby. Etc. If willful murder is wrong then it\u2019s a crime. Can I bomb an empty abortion clinic? Yes! It\u2019s a location where people gather to murder.\n\nAn old boyfriend and I got into an argument before I left FB. He said abortion clinic medical staff should go to jail for murder. I asked about the mothers. Oh, he says, not them! They were just led astray. All of them. The hypocrisy was ugly. His infantilizing of women was appalling and I told him so. I guess us women who want abortions are too stupid to understand the consequences of our actions. I dated him - he knows I\u2019m a smart woman with a college education but suddenly I\u2019m too stupid to recognize murder when I see it.\n\nI say let \u2018em talk like this. It\u2019s logical.",

Even if you originally consented, you should be able to withdraw consent.  That's part of why I think the original *Roe v Wade* court arrived at the correct conclusion:  Life begins at viability, i.e. the moment when it is possible (however unlikely) for a fetus to survive outside the womb. \n\nA woman has absolute rights over her own body, but there is a point where the person/possible person within her can survive without her.  If it's possible to remove the fetus/baby while giving both the mother and child a reasonable chance of living, then that should be the standard of care.  Any abortion before the point that the fetus has a reasonable chance of living outside the womb is entirely within the discretion of the host/\"mother\".",

You could claim that the fetus has the *potential* to be a person and should be allowed to come to term, however what about in cases of rape or in instances where the mother's health would be jeopardized if she carried the baby to term? Should the mother's lives, already fulfilled, be secondary to the chance of life?\n\nYou say trying to draw the line for when life starts is stupid, but it is a very real question we have to ask ourselves as a society because, up until a certain point, the fetus can't survive outside of the mother's womb.

But nowhere in the Bible do we get these four simple words: \"Don't get an abortion\".  Instead, we get Leviticus 19:27 \u201cDo not trim off the hair on your temples or trim your beards.\"  Pretty sure God just prioritized the type of haircut men can get over specifically proscribing abortion.  Maybe God decided there wasn't enough room in the Bible and decided to keep the thing about haircuts because that seemed really, really important?  Seems like a poor choice for God to demand a type of haircut that men everywhere will ignore and not get (except for Hasidic Jews), and leave out something as important as the four words all Christians are hot to force into God's mouth: \"Don't get an abortion\".\n\nThe Christianity claim is a flat-out lie, and only used as a shield against accusations of abject Republican misogyny and fascism.",

I'm talking about the New Testament.  The Jesus parts.\n\nHelp the poor, the sick, the foreigners.  Nope, no way that works in the QOP.\n\nEven their extreme position on abortion isn't supported by their holy book.  So many verses about the breath of life.  Verses that detail the punishment for injuring a pregnant woman.  Centuries of religious and legal traditions go against their position that life begins at conception.  Not only that, but the Bible goes into detail outlining a procedure that can only be described as an abortion. \n\nThey are Christian in name only.",
