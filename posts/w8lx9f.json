  "text": "TIFU by talking about sex with a patient (NSFW)\nThis was a few hours ago and I'm still embarrassed. I (26F) am a home health nurse and I work with a (17M) patient that is mentally challenged. He is very high functioning but has the mental capacity of about an 8 year old.\nAnyway this patient is very fixated on the fact that I am pregnant. He asks me every time I'm with him if I've picked a name and when I'm having the baby. \nToday as soon as I walked in the door to his house he says \"I know you had sex\" I am a little shocked by this and don't say anything. He follows up by saying \"I know that how you got pregnant.\" His mom is upstairs so I'm stuck navigating this by myself. (Important to the story) So here's where the FU comes. I said to him \"you're not wrong but sex isn't something you and I should talk about together. It's something you should ask your mom about.\" I had completely forgot this kid has an extreme fear of doing anything wrong and took my comment as he shouldn't have said that to me. I thought the conversation was over and done with but then Him, His Mom, and me all get in the car to go to school. \nAs soon as we are all stuck in the car together he very nervously yells \" THE NURSE AND I TALKED ABOUT HAVING SEX TOGETHER.\" Now, as a nurse I've seen and hears many awkward things but this one takes the cake. I very awkwardly had to explain to his mom the situation and no, I did not talk about having sex with her mentally challenged son. She thought it was hilarious but I'm still mortified.\n\nTLDR: the mom of my mentally challenged underage patient thought I talked to him about having sex together",

          "text": "\"I know you had sex!\" Lmao. I laughed so hard here. People have this crazy thought that mentally challenged kids don't or shouldn't think about things like sex but they should try to function in every other way like everyone else. My nephew is autistic and my SIL tries to shelter him from the whole world. \nI caught the kid trying to peep I to the bedroom where me and my husband were changing after our wedding. He pulled the door open a bit but you could see his whole face looking right at us lol. I thought it was convenient to change there en route to the honeymoon spot but man! I still have guilt over not telling her about that since I know she'll blow it out of proportion.",

A couple of times she told me stories about the crushes the clients would get on each other, like basic teen romance drama, but almost universally xxx and bisexual (I assume \"a friendly person with a warm body is a friendly person with a warm body\" is a somewhat accurate way to describe their mindset). \n\nFor all the disadvantages they had, I admired their lack of socially pressured boundaries. She also mentioned how the staff (all women IIRC) were trained to deflect any, um, flirtatious inquires that clients would occasionally pose to staff members (much more than \"just say no\"; it had to be friendly and conversational discouragement, not scolding).",

I genuinely thought other people could compartmentalise like me, had as much impulsivity as me and just controlled it better and I was just a massive fuck up... but I'm medicated and can figure out what's appropriate for societal expectations I never knew were there.\n\n\nI've been non monogamous for ages, I'm seeing someone & my long term partner is having some burn out recharge time living in another city &... there's no law that says you HAVE to live together. It seems to be working really well?? I'm super fulfilled?? And I'm way way better at communicating now I know there are gaps in what each party assumes & everything needs to be said because I apparently lack instincts about a lot of social pressures. It was genuinely a shock to me that straight people exist. I assumed everyone was like me and it was just a practicality thing when people hit puberty and wanted to have kids, that's why so many mixed sex couples were around. I'm that level of oblivious, but because I had gifted level intelligence elsewhere (fuck me, I can read but I can't understand shit unless it's explained to me - I thought Madame Bovary was tragedy & couldn't understand the tone of it at ALL until I read somewhere it was satire) everyone just assumed I was wilfully being an asshole",

My brother proceeded to stare at the earring for about 5 seconds and then asked the guy, \"did you know pirates wear earrings\"? My dad was speachless and trying not to laugh. He couldn't even be mad, because my brother was right, pirates do wear earrings. Pirate guy on the other hand was not as amused by the roasting he just had endure while waiting to poop in a McDonald's bathroom.\n\nAt this point, he decided he would rather prairie dog it than wait in the awkwardness until a stall opened up. I'm not sure what happened to him after that, but I think about him regularly.",

I made a fist and told her to lean her tooth into it till it came out, which she did without hesitation and laughed about crazily afterwards.

When we were teenagers and whenever my older brother and I were out with my mom at a store, my brother would say loudly \"Mom! Get that *item* out of your purse!\" or something similar that made her want to disappear. We, of course, thought it was hilarious.\n\nOnce when I was about 6 or 7, at the dinner table while religious friends of my mom's were over, I blurted out \"mom pooped in the dogs dish earlier!\". She had taken a rectal suppository (laxative) and I was on the toilet and wouldn't get off in time, the only other option was the dog's water dish hahaha\n\nGet ready!",

This also led to frequent diaper rashes because it was such a struggle to get her cleaned up. \n\nIt all came to a head the time my husband was trying to change her in a restuarant bathroom. She was her typical uncooperative, crying and such, but then she chose to start screaming over and over \"DON'T TOUCH ME! STOP TOUCHING MY LADY PARTS! YOU ARE HURTING ME!\"\n\nThe manager was summoned to the bathroom by a well-intentioned customer who overheard, and it was a whole  thing. Needless to say he never changed her diaper again in public.",

You will never find a news story about an innocent person who is rightfully not arrested, not sued, and not convicted. That is not seen as newsworthy, because I suspect that is what usually happens.\n\nJust because it's not in the news, does not mean that it doesn't happen. If you think it doesn't happen, because you don't see it in the news... Well, that would lead to a very biased worldview.\n\nOf course I don't want to deny your personal experience. If you have personally experienced that innocent people have been arrested without any due process or investigation, then I am not going to deny that. \n\nHave you experienced that?",

I wasn't convicted because it was obvious the police officer was an idiot for charging me in the first place, but it still cost me several thousand dollars in attorney and legal fees, and also an almost eviction from my apartment for even being *charged* with a crime. When all I did was choose the shortest lane at the grocery store.\n\nI met and spoke to Darryl Hunt, who spent decades in jail, even after DNA evidence showed his innocence. \n\nWhen I was in high school, several people were charged with felony kidnapping because they simply went with a girl to a dairy queen. The girl had \"run away from home\" and her parents had reported her missing. No one knew that though, she had neglected to mention it. So when the police came looking for her, they brought multiple people down to the station in handcuffs and actually charged 2 people with felony kidnapping even though the girl admitted that no one in the case knew she had run away from home and been reported missing. The cops didn't care, they charged the high school kids with felony kidnapping for going to eat dinner with a friend. They charges were dropped before the court case after they hired attorneys, but they still had to be bailed out of jail and all the social consequences of being arrested and charged with kidnapping.\n\nTell me again about my media selective bias though....",

Actually, wtf to a lot of these comments I'm seeing, I'm pretty sure my sex ed instruction in 5th grade catholic school in 1986 was better than some of the shit I'm seeing here. I switched to a public school in 6th grade and had it again as part of our health class, and it was awkward (because the gym teacher who taught it was obviously much more comfortable talking about nutrition and exercise than sex) but at least we learned the basics. Certainly neither class was ideal or as comprehensive as what we should have gotten, but ffs it's been three and a half decades since then",

For that one, I remember we were taken as a field trip someplace to watch a presentation about it. It was really introductory type stuff, and went over basic anatomy and things like that.    \n  \n6th grade was in rural northern Illinois, strongly skewing conservative but not insanely so (at the time, can't vouch for now). That was a unit of our health class, and like I said, the teacher was obviously uncomfortable, but bless him he tried his best, lol. Like I said, it definitely could have been more comprehensive, but at least he did quickly and awkwardly attempt to explain how sex worked. I don't really understand why sex ed didn't continue into high school when it really could have been more helpful, but yeah...geez, at least it was *something*",

As I pour the cup the of tea she looks to me and grabs my hand to hold it and says my name followed by \"can we not have sex tonight, I'm still very sore\". I went as Red and flushed as you could imagine. Before I could say anything the daughter laughed at me and said \"don't worry (my name)\".\n\nShe had dementia and thought I was her deceased husband. Gorgeous lady but it made for some awkward interactions. Another time I was washing up from the evening meal when she approached the window, naked asking if I was coming to bed! Had to get the nursing staff to help me with that one.",

As I was helping him with the Light Fury I asked if he was already getting Toothless or had Toothless and he said he had Toothless at home, I asked if they would be friends. He very firmly told me \u201cThey\u2019re BOYFRIEND and GIRLFRIEND.\u201d And I was like yeah they are aren\u2019t they and he was like \u201cThey\u2019re going to have babies!\u201d And I was like [indicating the baby dragons] \u201cI see that!\u201d And he was like. Top of his lungs. \u201cTHEY\u2019RE GOING TO HAVE **S E X**\u201d\n\nHis mom turns *bright* red and opens her mouth to chastise him but clearly doesn\u2019t know where to start and I\u2019m still just. Chipper, customer service, interacting with kids voice. \u201cThat\u2019s how babies are made, you\u2019re right!\u201d End of conversation and we moved on. His mom was so embarrassed and tried to apologize to me and I get it but he\u2019s a kid they just *say* stuff.

Not to be nit picky, but it\u2019s pretty degrading to people with support needs when you refer to them in terms of their \u201cfunction\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d. This implies that there is something inherently wrong with them as people. We try to avoid measuring them based on their functional capacity and focus more on acknowledging what kind of support needs they have. \n\nPs to all the ableists thinking about replying, I\u2019m not interested in your uneducated opinions on inclusive language. If you don\u2019t care about being inclusive and respectful, just say that and move on. This is for those of us who want to be more conscious about how we refer to people, treating them the way we would want to be treated.\n\nPurely informative. No shade intended. I had to learn all of this not too long ago after working with people with high support needs.\n\nEdit: spelling",

      "text": "I was a behavioural therapist (M28) and was working with a high functioning  10 year old autistic boy. He would sometimes try to kiss me since he kisses his mom and we were both important to him - my response was to go \u201cyuck\u201d and tell him not to. It was never a serious thing, it usually made me laugh. At first I\u2019d have to hold him away from me like a puppy trying to lick your face.  So he got the idea that he would ask if he could kiss me ( I\u2019d redirect it into a hug.).\nHe also had a thing where sometimes I\u2019d say \u201cmaybe later\u201d to something he wanted but when he needed to focus on schoolwork or speech work etc.\nSoooooo one day he has a temperature so when his mom gets home she takes him and me to the doctor.\nI was there to keep things from going sideways as he didn\u2019t like doctors dentists etc.\nOnce we got in the room with the doctor he checked his temperature and wasn\u2019t concerned and the boy thought it would be a good time to kiss me. So I\u2019m holding him away from me as he giggles and squirms trying to get at me. I say no kissing!\nOf course he goes \u201cmaybe later??\u201d\nThe doctor looked like he was going to call the cops. The mom was just whatever he does this. But it was a moment. This doctor looking at me like he caught a molester when it was the other way around!!!\n\n(Never mind the time he was 11 & he took his clothes off in the bathroom of a mall because he spilt juice all over, then decides to run out into the mall COMPLETELY NAKED.\nSo I\u2019m running after a nude boy in a mall. I catch him and am carrying him away and he\u2019s screaming \u201cnooooo nooooo let me go\u201d and I\u2019m trying to SOMEHOW act casual with a naked boy (they are hard to hold on to!) telling a let me go, under my arm. Yeah a tiny bit awkward)",

My nephew (approx 8yo) was really interested and wanted to watch. So I took him on a tour of my farm. In the barn one of the cows was sitting in the corner, and as I was introducing him to all my cows names he asked what that cow was doing. I said that was where the pregnant cow waits, and of course was followed up with why, in which I replied... it's the spot the cow gives birth to a calf.\n\nAfter I had returned home, my sister rings me half laughing asking what we had been doing and talking about. Apparently he had gone to school and told his teacher how his aunt had come to visit and she showed him her birthing spot.... mortified haha",
