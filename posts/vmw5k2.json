Thank you r/atheism for giving me the strength to do so.\nYesterday I made a post asking people whether or not I should leave my Christian boyfriend, in spite of everything else being fine, due to his anti-choice views. I expected to only get a handful of replies, but much to my surprise there were over 700 responses. I read them all, and couldn\u2019t be any more grateful for all of your thoughts. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019ve had a few people message me about what I decided to do, and the answer is that I was honestly on the fence, but after reading all of your wise words, I realise that leaving is the only option, and so as tough as it was, as of today my life is now Christian free. \n\nI know I am just some random woman on the Internet, and most of you probably don\u2019t care, but I just wanted to thank you all for giving me the strength to make this decision. I\u2019m now looking forward to open up a fresh chapter of life where I am now free to find a man who would respect me: an atheist man.\n\nThank you all!",

Why all the talk of white vs non-white birthrates?  Why harsher punishments for and tighter scruples on women, especially women of color?  Why is the state pushing for \"traditional family values\", and why do those values specifically command that we have more children?\"",

I consider myself pretty hard left (anti-nation-state, anti-billionaires, pacifist, pro-immigration etc.) and I find some of his lectures to be of value and containing interesting thoughts.

I find this acceptable because it promotes public health, and is a net positive for humanity as a whole to have fewer of us dying.

Society incentivizing women to have more children would be the only correct option in this case.\n\nFurther, a major difference between mandated vaccinations and forced birth is that nobody is being forced under pain of imprisonment to get vaccinated. People who insist on refusing vaccination are free to remove themselves from situations where vaccination is required. So no more air travel, concerts, or restaurants for them, but they preserve their bodily autonomy if they really want to.",

And let's not forget that the procedure known as an abortion is lifesaving for women who have had an incomplete miscarriage, to diagnose or resolve certain medical conditions, and in some cases is needed after a birth if the placenta is not completely delivered.\n\nThe government should not be involved in medical decisions, but if they are going to cross that line, then let's apply it equally.  All male adults should be required to register for living organ and tissue donation for blood, plasma, liver and bone marrow.  Think of all the lives that would be saved if there were shorter waitlists for donations of this type.   Women of childbearing age should be excluded, as these procedures could be a danger to a fetus.  No medical costs or paid leave will be provided for these procedures.  They can use FMLA, and take unpaid leave unless their employer will pay for their leave, especially after liver donation which is major abdominal surgery.  If they have complications, too bad, so sad.",

Please don't call me christian, let's not take things too far. \n\nAlso, my description relates to any relationship of two people with different beliefs. They might even be both christians, just protestant and catholic for example. One who believes stronger will try to impose this belief on a child. I mean if they truly believe their path leads to salvation, they will want the same for their child, and if they don't believe that, they wouldn't subscribe to this religion.  \n\nI had several examples in my life that showed how it may end, and i can tell you, it's just not worth the risk.",

As time passed, she went deeper into her faith and I pulled further away from mine. This was likely a factor in her and I disliking each other so very much. I never mocked or judged her for her faith but I did not participate and this excluded me from her circle of friends and her family.

She was incredibly violent at times, emotionally and physically abusive towards me while hiding behind this facade of a good, godly, Christian woman. My experience with her probably solidified my lack of faith forever.",

While a lot of people are foolish enough to fall into the trappings of religion, some of those are genuinely kind people that just fundamentally misunderstand the workings of the world because of how well indoctrinated they were as children. I know their hypocrisy and foolishness all too well, but we Athiests should understand exactly what it's like to be generalized and excluded based off of those generalizations. We don't need to make their same mistakes. There are good and smart people that admit to following religions, same as there are absolute smooth brains that are Athiests. Individuals can be flawed while still being great and exceptionally worthy.\n\nEdit: for examples of smooth brained Athiests, look below! People are so dumb they thought this comment was somehow in defense of the piece of shit I congratulated and supported OP in dumping. Probably just reading the 2nd sentence and getting upset I won't be an absolute fuckwit and deal in absolutes. In the same way not all religious people are horrendous creatures that want to tear your rights away from you, not all athiests are even intelligent enough to fucking read. We treat people as individuals because while some traits may be more common within a certain group, they are not exclusive or guaranteed.",

Yeah, there are *some* religious fanatics (too many writing legislation) who believe God would never let someone die to a complicated pregnancy, but for the most part (71% according to a quick poll I looked up) anti-choicers are in favor of having the choice of abortion when there's \"a danger to the life of the mother\" (e.g. ectopic pregnancies).\n\nWhat they're not in favor of, are medically unnecessary abortions, particularly the further along in development the fetus is, and when they hear \"This legislation will kill women\", they don't think you're referring to women with ectopic pregnancies, they think you're referring to (as some are) women who just wanted an abortion badly enough to get one in a back alley. Nobody likes being emotionally blackmailed with \"If you don't let me get what I want, I'm going to kill myself getting it\", which is why they will never find those particular arguments compelling.\n\nAnd when they see testimony like this (one minute video, important exchange right at the start) https://v.redd.it/ezlseyim5g091 , they don't see the pro-choice side looking reasonable. She's a doctor, and even though she's talking to a fucking wingnut, she ends up the one sounding insane because she can't muster up a common sense answer like \"No, of course we wouldn't abort a healthy fetus moments before delivery\".",

The proof it\u2019s more than just they don\u2019t want someone killing a fetus because they\u2019re ignorant to how harmful pregnancy is, is when you confront them about forced organ donation when the victim\u2019s ailment was caused by you (or not), if they don\u2019t end up throwing expletives at you because they can\u2019t argue back, they argue your autonomy is trumped by their right to life or that a woman should be forced into pregnancy anyway even with the risks involved. There\u2019s no discussion with someone of this level of stupidity whether they\u2019re religious or not, they actively wish harm on women in spite in some cases.\n\nBut I have to agree with you, people who argue on the prochoice side really have no idea how to do so with prolifers and they rarely use any of the irrevocable arguments nor educate them on the relevant points such as the complications or pregnancy, rate of miscarriage, autonomy, medical nuances etc. the list goes on. The humanity of the fetus is also a pretty mute point that I wish prochoicers would stop using because it\u2019s irrelevant compared to autonomy and actually weakens their argument, because, yes, the fetus has human DNA, but so what?",

However, there's a fundamental issue with the idea that the people in charge of the GOP are acting on behalf of the unborn, namely that if it truly was about looking after the well-being of the people they wouldn't constantly be opposing pretty much every social welfare service.\n\nI know that there are people who do genuinely think it's murder and don't want to make life harder for the mother. I go look at r/CatholicMemes sometimes and while they oppose abortion they also generally support services such as better maternal healthcare, so with them, I can believe they genuinely care. However, those are not the people who are in charge of the political party which has been trying to ban abortions.\n\nThe GOP's goals appear to be to appeal to an extremist faction and to normalize policies that erode the privacy and the autonomy of the populace. Even if some of their supporters have good intentions, those good intentions are being abused to push much less pleasant goals.\n\nOn top of that, even if someone genuinely feels like abortions are murder, to argue against the right to abortion is still an argument against bodily autonomy for pregnant females. Intentions matter, but intentions can't change the fact that if a pregnant female can't choose to have an abortion she doesn't have bodily autonomy.\n\nThe best argument an anti-abortionist could make is that they are merely prioritizing the life of the fetus over the autonomy of the mother, but even then they're still voting against bodily autonomy, and that's significant enough an issue that someone who is pro-choice might not consider that an acceptable position, no matter how much the anti-abortionist reiterates that it's really about the fetus.",

There are multiple ways to interpret this, and I will address each one.\n\n1: Ensure they're voting blue, if not, break up with them. This one is probably the most reasonable interpretation of this, I don't think it's necessarily wrong to leave someone who disagrees with you on fundamental levels of politics.\n\n2: They have to vote blue. No, they don't, they have the right to vote however they want, regardless of your politics. Look, I'm blue all the way, but we have the right to vote however we want.\n\nFor both of them, this seems an unreasonable waste of time, you should be worrying more about who you're going to vote for than who your partner is voting for.\n\nI get where you're coming from, I wouldn't want to date someone who is pro-forced birth, but that's where breaking up comes in, if you fundamentally disagree with someone to such a degree it will tear a relationship apart, leave them.

(I think anyone not pro-choice is crazy, lol)\n\nI know many people who are Christian that I aslo think are good people. They are pro-choice, anto-violence, open to other life styles. I even dated one because our beliefs about life in general matched up in other areas. \n\nI am really happy for you that you loved on from someone who was clearly not the right person for you.

Some religious people are tolerant enough to be permanently ok with that. I've been in relationships with some :). But they have to be REALLY ok with that. No hidden agendas. But if you can find someone like that, then religion gets out of the way, and the other components of personality can be used to determine the future of the relationship. As they should :):).",

I know you're not really an atheist and that this was just a social experiment to prove what you thought was a point: that all athiests have the same militant beliefs and that \"atheism is a religion\".
