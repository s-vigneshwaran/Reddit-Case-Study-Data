The pursuit of the glorious utopia means anything in the way of it is *evil.*\n\n*\u201cOf all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be \"cured\" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.\u201d*\n\nC.S.

That friend was into social activism. I don't remember the cause, but it was some social reform in some country that I don't remember, either. They lost contact. One day, a monk found a book. The book told of horrendous atrocities in that country. There was a photo in the book. To the monk's complete amazement he saw his friend in the photo of the people who committed the atrocities.\n\nThis is why I'm an anti-progressive. I know that, deep down, their hearts are filled with a sense of injustice. This leads to callousness and anger.",

Those traits and characteristics are now bad and you will get shamed, labelled, ostracised, excluded, etc. In some cases it will be overt (like a bad date or the reason why you aren't getting promoted) but most often it's covert or subtle (like harder to make friends/business partners since you would be an outlier compared to everyone else who is going along with... or are deep in the 'new think'). \n\nThere are some men who hate it.. don't believe in this new age craziness where being a man is inherently bad... BUT they go along to get along which is just as bad because it promotes it by placid acceptance. They understand the best and selfish way to make their way in the world is to say/do/don't say whatever is required to further their self-interest in sex, relationships, business, etc. \n\nTLDR: I wouldn't hold my breath.",

I have already laid out scenarios where abortion is allowed and where the fetus is forced to be carried to term. \n\nIn which scenario are you referring to?\n\nMost abortion should be allowed under fringe scenarios, and even then only early in the pregnancy.",

If the fetus has complications, and is doomed to a life of pain and misery, then abortion is allowed so that the child doesn't suffer in life. Again this stance is utilitarian.\n\nIn the 2nd case, the justification is a little harder to explain, but the issue is one of consent. Did two adults willingly engage in sex, whether or not the intention was to create life, that is the result. So their burden is to nurture that life.\n\nIf the woman was instead raped. They now have 15 weeks to prepare the legal paperwork and evidence of rape to terminate the pregnancy. The woman never willingly engaged in sex, so she shouldn't be held with the burden of carrying it past the 1st trimester, where it becomes a fully-fledged viable fetus.",

Would she regret not getting an abortion if her boy decided to be a girl?\n\nEdit: This isn't anti-Trans btw before anyone thinks it is.\n\nLeading on from my point above; does anyone think that gender disappointment from parents can guide someone's mind down the route of thinking that they're the wrong gender and need to become trans? \n\nLike if a girl is born and the father wanted a son but got a girl and so pushes her to do men's sports, watch TV that boys would watch, wear boy's clothes etc. Does this make it more likely that this girl will become a trans-man?\n\nAnd likewise if a mother wanted a girl but got a boy (before aborting...) and so pushes him towards playing with Barbie's, learning make up and being a cheerleader instead of a player; does this make it more likely this boy will become a trans-women.\n\nJust a couple things I thought about.",
