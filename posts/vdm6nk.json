One is to forgo luxuries, due to Jesus' temptation by Satan in the desert as well as the fact that Jesus himself was poor. Another is because on Friday, the Sixth Day, God created animals, and Jesus' death was also on a Friday, so it's symbolic of retraining from the shedding of blood. Fish are exempt from this because they are cold blooded, whereas animals (like Christ) are warm blooded. Jesus even recommended fasting altogether since it allegedly brings one closer to God. \n\nThink before you speak.",

Had to un-brainwash myself and it wasn't easy. Believe me, a lot is wrong with religion on a fundamental level.\n\nWhichever flavour you give your religion, it will always be based on the concept of believing in ideas because they make us feel good, as opposed to believing in what makes the most sense.\n\nThat's a very dangerous way of thinking and the perfect breeding ground for propaganda and conspiracy theories. Not a coincidence that Qanon has a mostly Christian evangelist base.\n\nIronically, believing in what makes you feel good doesn't seem to actually make you feel good in the long run, cause you're chasing a lie preventing you from addressing the real issues.

There is a legitimate critic to religion and they're missing the point completely.\n\nBut so do you: the green doesn't vindicate the red. Just because some people (how much?) decided to distort their religions enough so that it would end up promoting humanitarian values, this doesn't vindicate its existence either.\n\nIn any case, I'm a Stirnerist, so I don't believe in humanitarian values either. I believe in being yourself and finding personal joy in participating in your community.

You wouldn't understand.\n\n>> Explain the high acidity oh human gastric juice.\n\n> What even does this question means\n\nDon't worry about it. It has to do with nutrition.\n\n\"It is interesting to note that humans, uniquely among the primates so far considered, appear to have stomach pH values more akin to those of carrion feeders than to those of most carnivores and omnivores. In the absence of good data on the pH of other hominoids, it is difficult to predict when such an acidic environment evolved. Baboons (_Papio_ spp) have been argued to exhibit the most human\u2013like of feeding and foraging strategies in terms of eclectic omnivory, but their stomachs \u2013 while considered generally acidic (pH = 3.7) \u2013 do not exhibit the extremely low pH seen in modern humans (pH = 1.5). One explanation for such acidity may be that carrion feeding was more important in humans (and more generally hominin) evolution than currently considered to be the case [...]\" - [\"The Evolution of Stomach Acidity and Its Relevance to the Human Microbiome\" (2015)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0134116)",
