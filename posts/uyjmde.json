It also increases if the teachers are willing to bring in outside information to suppliment poor corriculum material. unfortunatly, I have worked with both extremes in the same facility. a teacher who glossed over areas they didnt agree with personally, and several who were burnt out and taught what they were handed and nothing else. \n\nI had a great time in my younger years and was fortunate to have excellent teachers in sprinked in all of my grades. I have been homeschooled, including sponsored activites by the state to go to museums and historic sites and conventions, as well as 6 years in public schools. It sounds like you didn't have great teachers, or at least feel like you have been lied to. (I have been SUPER baited lol) I feel sorry for that. there isn't anything I can do about your past, but if you want to have some friendly banter and debate I am always down.

One of the books (among several) we had to read was the Communist Manifesto and were educated on the several stages to achieving a \"true\" Communist state and we spent over a week on the subject. In fact, there has never been a true Communist country. Countries such as China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, etc. always declared themselves as being in one of the \"socialist\" states (hence their use of the word \"social\" or \"socialist\" in their names), which were needed before getting to a \"true\" Communist state, which has no true government. We were also taught the difference between the \"socialist\" stage before achieving a Communist state and a Socialist -Democracy. Of course, Communism, like many other \"Utopian\" doctrines, always fails to consider one important factor in their recipes: Human traits such as greed, corruption and a great ability to fuck up the most simplest of things. But here in \"Murica,\" we tend to use words such as \"Socialist\" and \"Communism\" as boogey-man tropes to instill fear into things we don't like.",

Again, my teacher taught us that Communism is when you have a police state and no rights. Nothing more nothing less. Without my teacher expanding on that it's a bit like saying a liberal democracy is where the wealth class bribes politicians for power and you get to kill your unborn children. Even though that's true in a many cases it doesn't define what a liberal democracy is.",

Its a bad idea rooted in good intentions and if people keep thinking that good intentions are more important on a macro scale then incentive structures they will be rudely awakened by another failed 50 years of people dying for a \"better future\"\n\nAnd I mean it, most of the people that still fantasize about communism are the ones that were obedient and/or snitched on their family, neighbors or anyone else for that matter and got something in return or were part of the party structure.

This is basically social democracy you're describing. \n\nSocialists oppose the private ownership of the means of production on moral principle. They view the system of capitalism as inherently exploitative.  This is the entire basis of the Proudhon \"property is theft!\" argument - he's talking about capital property (stockholdings, factories, real estate, etc) and not your toothbrush/car/house. Proudhon basically distinguishes between \"property\" and \"possessions\". \n\nThe argument in \"Property is Theft\",  aggressively simplified, is made in the example of a tenant farmer ; \n\n1. Tenant farmer works, produces value, improves the property  \n\n\n\n2. Property owner seeks rents, denies compensation for improvements made, and accepts no cost not paid by the tenants to improve the land \n\n\n\n3. Tenant every year pays money out for the right to use the land, if he becomes more productive and successful then his rent likely rises \n\n\n\n4. Landlord becomes wealthier every year, loses nothing by renting land he is not working, his land improves by the labor of his tenant  \n\n\n\nThe landlord has stolen value the tenant farmer created. It's not possible to be a socialist and believe that capitalism and socialism are mutually compatible. Capitalism is literally theft in a socialist moral framework.",

(I\u2019ll add a historical explanation at the end of this post.)\n\nIn countries where there isn\u2019t a taboo on socialism, there is little distinction between socialism and social democracy.\n\nIt\u2019s only in the US and other countries where people on the right have demonised the word \u2018socialism\u2019 that people feel the need to exactly define socialism and exclude social democracy from the definition.\n\nAnd often not in a good way.\n\nPositive examples of socialism are often met with: \u2018that is not socialism, let me explain what socialism is, and why socialism is bad\u2019.\n\nSocialism is both an ideal and a set of evolving ideas.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nJust to be clear about the history of social democracy:\n\nSocial democracy started in Germany in the 19th century and was a socialist and communist movement.\n\nSocial democrats were not necessarily anti-capitalism, or proponents of a revolution. They wanted to use democratic systems to create more equality. They wanted to change systems based on capitalism, not eradicate private ownership of the means of production.\n\nPeople tend to forget, but once upon a time, capitalism was quite progressive, it gave power to common people instead of the nobility. There is a link between capitalism and democracy.\n\nWhen under the influence of the work of Karl Marx, communism became more popular, many socialist started to distance themselves from communism.\n\nAfter the Russian revolution, most socialists in Europe united as social democrats, to make it clear that they were not communists interested in a revolution.\n\nAfter WWII, social democracy and socialism were pretty much used interchangeably in Western-Europe. Social democracy is mainstream socialism.",

If German socdems wouldn't have failed so hard, then we may not have seen Hitler even rise to power.  \n\nCapitalism has never been progressive, it's literally a vestige of royalty and the common law system of property ownership is a hand me down from literal Magna Carta days. The original corporations were East India company, Hudson Bay company  - privateers under the English flag allowed to enslave and murder.   \n\nYou've bought into some romanticized ideal of capitalism, but it's always been a reactionary force. \n\nAlso, I just don't understand how Europeans are processing what socialism means if they are just lumping welfare capitalism, social democracy, and actual socialism together. Just either sloppy use of words or understanding of the concepts.   \n\nThere are certainly socialist aspects of capitalist countries, and I understand what you're driving at, but socialism should be the end goal of any socialist and that necessarily means opposition to capitalism as anything other than a transition state.",

And their influence will be directed with one goal - to earn more money. What can ordinary people do to go out and riot and what will be the result? And the rich will simply buy congressmen and those who make laws, and here the result will already be visible. Anarchism? Communism is currently an advanced formation in social relations.

This is a pretty abstract concept, but the idea behind it is that those who do the work also reap the benefits. Health care in the US is predominantly for-profit, meaning that certain individuals reap disproportional benefits from health insurances without actually doing any of the work. Lowering the cost of healthcare would shift the ability of profiting from healthcare (I mean profiting in the general sense, not just financially) from individuals to the general population a.k.a. the workers. So, in that sense I think it fits in nicely with the ideology of socialism.  \n\nThough I get the sense I'm off on this, as people are downvoting my original comment and replying in the sense that I'm wrong. I'm willing to concede to that, but would like to know what I'm missing here. Got to grasp any chance to learn.",

And of course a lot was rules in what insurance could not do (kick people off parental insurance before 26; kick people off for being sick; etc.)\n\nSocialism's theoretical approach to soaring medical costs would be to remove all large-scale private ownership of medical care (arguments could be made for people running their own one-man clinic, especially for entirely elective procedures like boob jobs.) If the state centrally controls prices, salaries, and (duh) production and distribution, it also ensures adequate supply of doctors through state funded education. It also would control production of medical goods. And it would fund r&d into new medical goods and techniques. Or at least it tries... centrally planned economies could never be described as particularly efficient at meeting demand for just about anything. Even vodka in russia had shortages. Maybe when we get Asimov's Univac doing it for us, but hasn't happened yet. But certainly there would be no insurance middleman because you wouldn't need a middleman between you and the means of production you technically own, in theory. \n\nSocial services paid for by taxes and fees ... isn't socialism, even if they both contain the word social.",

The savings and the less is paid for healthcare because govt regulation of reflection of actual costs and supply and demand can be lost all by the company administration being private/profit-driven. If admin decides the profit margin cannot be impacted, the workers will be and if the workers are impacted the services are impacted and the value of the end product/service has dropped. I really see your point but calling any US govt program, regulation or whatever anything close to socialist/socialism seems simply like alarmism and the ACA was not even a tiny step towards 'socializing' the US economy, it just subsidized massive profit-driven capitalist healthcare companies and insurance with some regulations IMO. Even if we had single payer healthcare you can bet that it would just turn into a capitalist money pit like defense companies contracts, as long as those companies are capitalist but that's not to say it wouldn't be better/fairer than employer based healthcare. I write all this completely out of my ass though so take it with a grain of assy salt \ud83e\uddc2",

Just like abolition of slavery meant freeing all slaves.\n\n> Socialism ends up causing problems. It ideally has solutions, but in reality tends toward starvation.\n\nWhich problems does socialism cause that do not exist under capitalism? And how exactly does socialism lead to starvation?\n\nYour entire reasoning stems from misunderstanding socialism as some sort of government controlled centrally planned undemocratic system, which it just isn't. Please tell me where you got your ideas about socialism from, because it sure as fuck ain't any theory",

People in this thread told me that.\n\nYes, and when all workers own the means of production it is meaningless. It does not improve anything. Especially for the workers. The workers do not become rich in that model.\n\nThe better way to own the means of production is with the stock market. Capitalism giving employees stock options is also a great opportunity for workers.\n\nThe central planning of capital allocation is where socialism  tends to have a problem. Capitalist nations have this problem on a limited degree when governments start trying to spend to influence things and mostly just cause inflation. Governments can do good things, but often it is better to let the markets and companies allocate capital instead.\n\nI get my ideas about socialism from socialists, and socialist nations. Real socialist nations, not the capitalist Nordic nations some try to claim are socialist. Too many people confuse social programs with socialism. Social programs are fine with capitalism as the Nordic nations have shown.",

Hitler\u2019s Third Reich had been born, and it was entirely fascist in character. Within two months Hitler achieved full dictatorial power through the Enabling Act. In April 1933 communists, socialists, democrats, and Jews were purged from the German civil service, and trade unions were outlawed the following month. That July Hitler banned all political parties other than his own, and prominent members of the German Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party were arrested and imprisoned in concentration camps. Lest there be any remaining questions about the political character of the Nazi revolution, Hitler ordered the murder of Gregor Strasser, an act that was carried out on June 30, 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives. Any remaining traces of socialist thought in the Nazi Party had been extinguished.",

But, if all you've ever heard about is Capitalism and Communism,  with Socialism being equated to Communism,  then yes, you would believe Capitalism is the best.

Capitalism works fine with unions and regulations. The 40 hour work week is irrelevant to this. Workers rights are part of both systems. Unions are a part of the markets. Some unions are good, and some are bad.\n\nObviously you can have systems that are not perfect ideals of either system. That said the more socialist it gets the worse it gets. Sure you can make a profit in some light socialism, but in harder socialist nations that isn't allowed.\n\nPrice controls can be a problem. Cuba suffers greatly. It's healthcare is a joke even when some try to praise it. Doctors can barely survive on their wage and make more driving a cab as a second job.\n\nGovernments need to be more hands off with the economy. Governments tend to just ramp up inflation with their efforts.",

If anything they are examples of how good things can be.\n\nCompanies buying their competition is a mutually agreed deal most of the time. Hostile take overs are different. For the most point it isn't a problem. Some might say it is a great thing.\n\nAgain, it is a good thing when companies use their resources to the benefit of their product. This is called on ovation for the most part. I am not sure how you could put this in a way that it would be a bad thing.\n\nLoss leaders are far more common than you think. It's a normal part of business. It happens in every industry. Even in the other way of taking a loss in order to gain reputation from the work for future profit. A lot of construction will see this where companies take a loss to build something like affordable housing that turns into later work that makes up for the previous loss.\n\nAdvertising is a tactic. Sadly the only solution to it is to change people into better spotting and ignoring it. Sometimes it is informative, and honestly sometimes I prefer ads for sales of products I like and use instead of random ads.\n\nAutomation is not only a good thing, it may actually lead to deflation one day. As more labour it automated more wealth is generated faster. Prices of common goods will fall and we might see a type of economic deflation. Cathy Woods has some interesting predictions along those lines. Her research approach has a good track record.\n\nCan you give any good examples of these things being harmful?",

They were a small start up that used vertical integration and new technologies to innovate and provide something legacy car makers couldn't because of their established supply lines and infrastructure.\n\nHell, even when the legacy companies tried to use loss leaders Tesla was still able to compete and start making a profit while legacy companies still struggle to profit on an EV.\n\nEven with the advertising budgets of their competition Tesla has been able to use word of mouth and letting social media promote their product. They don't sue people for using their brand, so people are free to use the Tesla logo and give Tesla free promotion. It was an innovative idea for a small start up.\n\nIf they can actually make the Tesla bot then automation will go on an epic level. At that point economics would change a lot. In the same way that it use to be that everyone was involved in getting food for everyone and now only 1% of people are needed to feed the world we could see wealth generated by a small portion of people for all. That one remains to be seen of course. Automation is coming though.\n\nAs for monopolies they are a problem. At that point you are reaching an example of when regulations are needed. More important we need to have regulations that do not enforce monopolies.",

Do you really expect massive companies to let most of their staff go because their skills are not relevant to EV's? To suddenly break a ton of supply contracts negotiated for years in advance?  They make engines and bodies, and then outsource a lot of the rest. Reinventing their business model isn't easy just because of money.\n\nThe key takeaway about early Tesla is that Martin Eberhard made a shell company that was a name only. They wanted to make EV's and only had a name. Elon and JB came along with funding and a similar goal. They joined forces. Martin ended up being more of a liability than an asset.\n\nYes they had money, but that isn't all. It wasn't a simple matter of having a big bank role. It really wasn't that big considering the business they were making. Making a car company isn't easy. Making an EV company before anyone else really had was even harder. They didn't have deep pockets.\n\nI am hardly blind. I guess I've just learned more about these things beyond simple Google searches.",

And while the US definitely was in a better position economically, the biggest boom eras in the US were after the foundation of the Soviet Union, but before the Cold War.\n\nThe problem the Soviet Union encountered, just like any other command economy, was poor allocation of capital.  They could throw as much money as they wanted at something, regardless of the net result.  There were segments of the Soviet economy producing things nobody wanted or needed.  To be clear, there were segments of the American economy, and every other market economy, doing the same.  When they ran out of capital, they \\(generally\\) collapsed rather than being propped up by a constant inflow of capital.  That's not to say that there was no market economy in the Soviet Union, at least not after the economy collapsed early on in the history of the country.\n\nObviously, especially following the Great Depression, the US economy transitioned to a mixed economy also, and hasn't been a fully market economy in a very long time.  But the US economy is still much more strongly leaning toward a market economy than the Soviet economy ever was \n\nOn the Soviet side, there were other factors involved, of course, not all of which I can explain.  Corruption can happen in any system, and it happened to a great extent in the Soviet Union, and was one big factor.  Yes, the US had and has corruption, but nowhere near the level in the Soviet Union.  Also, the factors you mentioned to an extent \u2014 they were at a distinct disadvantage in some respects.  I'd argue that their diplomatic disadvantage was largely self-imposed, though.  The Soviet Union saw themselves not just as a nation, but also as a catalyst for the global Socialist movement, and encouraged Socialist groups in the West to engage in sabotage to further that.  Western nations did not to the same in the Soviet Union, nor among each other to a great extent.  Yes, I am ignoring a large number of nations that they did meddle in, because they did so without much peril to their diplomatic standing.\n\nJust to be clear, I'm ignoring the causes of the actual collapse \u2014 mainly the lowering of the iron curtain and allowing people to see the difference in quality of life versus the West.  This wouldn't have happened if the Soviet economy grew at the same rate as the US economy.",

The command economy was however also massively advantageous for them as the leaped generations ahead in development. But for sure they stuck to it way too long.\n\nI think Russia was always going to be worse off than the US as they are even now. As to your argument about US booms. Its always been better to be American than Russian excepting those in power. Even during the great depression.\n\nYou're right to call out governance issues, which the type of economy really doesnt seem to impact. Im not sure you can say that the ussr is more or less corrupt than modern russia is. It seems endemic to Russia, maybe the bolsheviks should have had more foresight to establish a strong independent judiciary.\n\nI think without military threat of the US and a predominantly worker owned market economy, rather than a predominantly state owned command economy the USSR would have become a viable state. Better for Russians than what they currently have but not necessarily better than Americans have. America is a far more effective imperial power just by virtue of geography, this contributes massively to its economic growth.\n\nThe reality of geopolitics in the last century is that communism isnt viable because of the US.\n\nIve explained why I think the US made it harder for a large power like the USSR.\n\nFor smaller countries than the USSR the US has responded to nationalisation of strategic assets and socialist governments with sanctions, and financing opposition factions within those states, leading to economic failures and instability in the developing regions of the world. Before ww2 the US even sent troops to south america in response to labor disputes.",

This is done, not in order to \ufb01ll the coffers of the State with practically worthless paper, but with the deliberate intention of destroying the value of money as a means of payment. There is no justification for the existence of money in the Bolshevik state, where the necessities of life shall be paid for by work alone.\n\nExperience has taught us it is impossible to root out the evils of capitalism merely by confiscation and expropriation, for however ruthlessly such measures may be applied, astute speculators and obstinate survivors of the capitalist classes will always manage to evade them and continue to corrupt the life of the community. The simplest way to exterminate the very spirit of capitalism is therefore to flood the country with notes of a high face-value without financial guarantees of any sort.\n\nAlready even a hundred-ruble note is almost valueless in Russia. Soon even the simplest peasant will realize that it is only a scrap of paper, not worth more than the rags from which it is manufactured. Men will cease to covet and hoard it so soon as they discover it will not buy anything, and the great illusion of the value and power of money, on which the capitalist state is based will have been definitely destroyed.\n\nThis is the real reason why our presses are printing ruble bills day and night, without rest.\u201d\n\nMaybe you need to study some more.

It is different than socialism.\n\nSocialism is an ideology. It's a shared belief system. It's fluid in that it can have multiple variants and definitions because it's just a word that was popularized by Marx who also popularized Communist ideology.\n\nDo you have any idea how unrealistic that whole 'seizing the means of production' stuff is? Your entire foreign policy is based on jacking other people's resources for the oil and energy industry. How about start with realistic goals like getting Universal Healthcare and affordable utilities?",
