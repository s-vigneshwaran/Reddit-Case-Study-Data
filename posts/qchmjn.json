She wasn\u2019t too bright in general. Not sure why she was a teacher.\n\nTbf, I think she was a decent science teacher and actually a nice person. I don\u2019t think she or the kids were happy either the math situation. I really can\u2019t fathom why they chose her to substitute math when she wasn\u2019t well versed and was already teaching a different subject that she actually knew? I\u2019m totally just rambling now sorry.. Just my two cents and also felt the  need to give her credit regardless of the poor situation. Pretty sure nobody benefited from that.",

The third squaw weighs 300 pounds and she sits alone on the hide of a hippo.\n\nSo the squaw on the hippopotamus is equal to the sons of the squaws on the other two hides.\n\nThis story was accompanied by a cartoon filled with caricatures. It seems wildly inappropriate today, but I have to admit that it was a pretty effective mnemonic for the theorem.",

Just at my humble university that was tiny notch up from community college, about half of the chemists and physicists were Russian or European, and about 50% of the math teachers were Chinese also Korea was represented in Chemistry. But literally the sciences, excluding biology are 50% foreigners. Which is lovely in itself. It makes for a colorful cast of characters in your class schedule.\n\nWe're like some bloated overlord... \"bring me the wisest humans in the land so I can ignore their advice!\"",

However, I think what the teacher is satirizing is the rainmaking ritual, which exists in some southern Aboriginal tribes as well as other peoples in different countries where rain/water is scarce. I think christians would call this \"praying for rain\".\n\nBut this teacher... this *hwite* lady... is comparing it to pagan rituals because that's how most christians still view us. We are, to many of them, pagans, heathens and uncivilized. We may as well be sacrificing babies and scalps to some totem god as far as some of them are concerned. And yes, that is something I heard a few times from *hwite* people (this was back in the late 90's mind you) because we were learning about South American history and the like. Because they were sometimes referred to as *indigenous* and *aboriginal*, and we identify as indigenous and/or aboriginal... You get the idea.\n\nIt's not the first time I've seen *hwite* people mishmash our culture with some other culture because of similar sounding words or phrases... in English. So that this *hwite* lady heard \"rain\" from rainmaking rituals and \"rain\" from praying to some pagan rain deity and thought \"hmmm, these two things are exactly the same...\"...",

We likely have a shit ton of language that's so similar our elders and some current members could speak easily in Ojibwe, also the name of our language, but pronouncing various words is different, many words are slightly different but similar enough to figure out what they mean, and much of our oral stories are from the same history. Much of our culture is dissimilar, as just a few hundred years of being from different regions quickly results in differences like what types of homes our families built, what we ate, where we travelled during various times of the year.",

On the board behind her you can see \"TOA\" as part of the sketch she is projecting from her computer.  This mnemonic is commonly taught to students of trigonometry.\n\nHowever, for her lesson, this teacher has put on a headdress with feathers.  She talks about wielding tomahawks.  These are all symbols of native american culture.  At the end of the video, she talks about receiving \"all\" her feathers, with an associated illustration on her presentation, this time adding tipis.  In this video she dances around frenetically, chanting \"SOHCAHTOA\" over and over again.\n\nWhile she is doing this SOHCAHTOA presentation, she is chanting, dancing, roaming through the classroom, and climbing on desks.  That behaviour is unusual and certainly questionable during any class.  However when she has clearly indicated that she is portraying a native american character, she is attaching that questionable behaviour to the character she has conjured up.  The fact that she is capriciously attaching her bizarre behaviour to a native american character is insulting to native americans.",

Actually, this lady looks about my age.\n\nI'm not saying he behavior doesn't need to be reoriented, but I have a hunch there's less ill will and more ignorance involved. I've always thought we should try to have a conversation with people like this before punishing them so harshly that they become bitter enemies. As far as I'm concerned, jerkoffs like Trump are a reaction to the left's hyper-aggressive cancel culture. Destroying someone's life because they screwed up in ignorance is pretty mean-spirited, too.",

While some of the things she does here could look similar to actual rituals used in the various communities, this looks exactly like portrayals of 'indians' in western movies where they are largely villains or dehumanized and how I've seen people make fun of those cultures due to those movies being the prevailing narrative in the US until very recently. I suppose it technically is possible she was making fun of the stereotypes themselves, but I really doubt it. Also this is apperantly happening in a math class and I really cannot figure out why. My best guess is her aim is to get the students to remember 'sohcahtoa' (what the lesson was about) and it sounds like it could be a native American word-however me thinking that may also be from false narratives",

I didn't state that they are often far more complex than what she is doing, from the ones I have seen at least. The knowledge behind and the intention of the portrayal is often a large part of the difference as well. Her wearing a slapped together (paper?) headdress, praying to be shown the \"secret indian chant\", and the reaction of the students, especially the one who actually is native American, are all pretty telling in my opinion.\n\n3. I did point out that she may have been calling the stereotypes ridiculous. I never blanket statement said she definitely was making fun of actual cultures and traditions. Could she have been calling herself ridiculous? I personally don't think it likely but it's not impossible. The stereotypes themselves? Maybe. I also find it unlikely that the student would post this, if it were either of those possibilities.

What could students possibly learn from the latter?\n\nIf you wanted to teach students about medieval Europe, what do you think would be more effective - showing them a documentary about medieval Europe that is based on actual scholarly research, or taking them to a Renaissance fair where they can see a bunch of completely made-up stereotypes about the era? Sure, they\u2019ll find the second more engaging, but they won\u2019t actually learn anything.\n\nI mean, if you really want to be interactive, you could root your interactive exercises in *actual information about the cultures or history you\u2019re trying to teach about* instead of whatever you\u2019ve been exposed to in pop culture.",

This was like *just* before everyone started having smartphones and people didn\u2019t record everything. \n\nAnyways, the teacher tried to defend herself saying it was a joke and not a racist word. The Muslim kid calmed down a little... until the teacher turned on the projector to show everyone what \u201cgunga din\u201d was to prove it wasn\u2019t racist. She shows a clip of a half naked Indian beggar wearing a turban and acting like a slave to a bunch of white British soldiers... half of the class starts **laughing hysterically** and the Muslim kid freaks out again, he starts dropping the f-word and calling the teacher a racist bitch and storms out of the class.\n\nAgain, this was our **first day of high school.** This was at a private Catholic school that was very selective (you had to take an entrance exam, then do an interview with the principal and other teachers, and strong preference was given to kids who belonged to the Catholic Church). The school was also like 99% white. He was the only Muslim kid in our whole grade (and maybe in the whole school?) and he was seriously humiliated **by a teacher** on his first day of high school. Man, I never forgot that day and felt so bad for him. He got switched out of the class the next day but the nickname stuck for **four years**\u2014kids are fucking brutal. He was one of the smartest kids in the whole grade but the dude was bullied almost every day for four years. Honestly, don\u2019t know how he stuck it out the whole time. \n\nHaven\u2019t thought about that kid in years but this dumb bitch mocking native Americans reminded me of it.\n\nMan, wherever you are, I hope you\u2019re doing ok dude.\n\n**EDIT:** A lot of people find it unbelievable that a Muslim kid would be allowed in a Catholic School. In the US, or at least in my home state, private Catholic Schools were always among the best high schools for both sports and academics. My school alternated as both the top academic and sports school in the state every year (and still does). There are a certain number of spaces reserved for non-Catholic students to enroll but everyone (including Catholic kids) had to go through a tough application process which included exams and interviews. There were also a small number of kids who were clearly recruited and given scholarships from poorer families to play football (thus, our school\u2019s reign as one of the state\u2019s football powerhouses). Aside from the Muslim kid there were also non-Catholic Christian and Jewish students enrolled. Everyone had to go to mass on Fridays and the non-Catholic kids would participate in everything except receiving the sacrament (they would just stay seated in the bleachers). It was a great school overall but, like any high school, some kids are gonna have a shit time.",

Sometimes a whole family is bonkers and you can see it comes from quality parenting but other times some kids just have issues. Rules one is don't blame a kid for their behaviour before you meet the parents and the first rule is treat every kid in every lesson as if you have no history with them. Fresh start every time.\n\nEdit: damn I forgot this was the internet and have to be specific and 100% accurate in my use of language or someone will either think I'm stupid or have a melt down. Yes, I know 2 first rules. I was being silly because there is no order in which one has 'rules' on how to treat students. Now stop being such literalists.",

I couldn't control it. \n\nShe was absolutely convinced that I was doing it on purpose to be funny, despite me never disrupting any class in any way other than those occasional burps. She would literally stop the class to lecture me about how rude I was and make me personally apologize to her. I also got sent to the principal several times to be punished.....\n\nUntil one day a doctor diagnosed me with a slight medical issue that was contributing to the gas and burping while I was digesting. My mother took the diagnosis to the principal and they forced the teacher to apologize to me lmfao",

The city is home to the Republican Party of California and it was not a politically correct environment to say the least we had nazi skate punks thinking back on it it was truly a bizarre place to grow up. Now that I\u2019ve painted you a lovely racist picture of the environment let\u2019s get to it. We had a teacher who repeatedly told a black student to keep his cotton picking hands off his phone the teacher tried to defend himself saying it was just a old phrase but no one bought that shit since he was a self declared cowboy lol he didn\u2019t get fired or anything just publicly shamed. I had a lot of trouble in school because I had adhd and some learning and behavioral issues so I was well known with the teachers. I had been on a million different kinds of medications because I kept getting diagnosed with different conditions but the side effects of the medication kept making the staff think I was using drugs illegally so I ended up having to tell all my teachers and other staff what medications I was using and why. One day I wasn\u2019t paying attention and pissed off a teacher so her response was to out me very loudly saying just because you\u2019ve got this this and this doesn\u2019t mean you can behave this way take your medications you freak. Naturally I was hurt but didn\u2019t say shit however other students in my class felt bad for me and reported her and she ended up getting let go at the end of the year not really fired but not allowed to return. Due to all me shenanigans my brothers freshman year the teachers sized him out differently at first but were so different once they saw that they liked him. Sorry bout the rant",

I attempted suicide and landed myself in the hospital. I was there for six weeks, during the school year. My trigonometry teacher was aware I was in the hospital for an extended period of time. I had to get homework brought to me to stay on top of things. My other teachers were great. This teacher though... Refused to give me homework, lessons, nothing. Said that I needed to come to class if I want to get anything. Also said, there's no point in me giving you things because it'll be a zero anyways since you won't come in.

She dragged my desk into the hall and put a cardboard wall around me so I couldn't see out at all. She called it \"isolation\" and put me in it everyday. It went on for a month or so before I told my parents I wasn't learning anything because I wasn't in class and just cry in a box all day. They lit up that school and she got fired for abuse. I guess she threw a stool at a kid and hurt him pretty badly. I didn't know any different because it was first grade so I thought school was just torture.\n\nEdit: I apologize to anyone I have offended about the \"mean lesbian\" comment. She talked about not \"liking men\" and about how she would get so mad at the kids she would go home and throw firewood across her yard naming kids as she threw the logs and re-stacked it on the other side. WTF! She also liked to stand out front of the school on cold days and stick her hand down the back of the boys (including me; a lot) shirts and press her ice hands against their warm back. She was so mean. I hate that I had a bad image of lesbians for many years because of her. Now I have been to multiple gay weddings and have many lady friends that prefer women (understandable; if you have ever seen a nude man it looks like a joke)",

I had a racist black woman as a teacher. She grouped the only 4 white students in the class in the back corner together, and were the only kids in class with assigned seats. If one of us was struggling to understand something, we would help each other. I usually ended up helping the one boy next to me most often because I really clicked with math. The teacher would spend about half the class period preaching to us about different things, an example being \u201cevery time you buy Liz Claiborne or Tommy, you were giving money to the devil.\u201d I was the kid that wore all black so she always made a point to stare at me when she said it and stop in front of my desk before making a big point. (Public school as well so it was very illegal for her to be preaching). She rarely taught us math. Just handed out worksheets. I ended up failing her class by 1 point despite all the kids I had to help every day ended up passing with 80\u2019s or above. The school counselor noticed I had good grades in every other class so they put me in advanced algebra and after that I never had a problem again. That teacher was fired after the next year.\n\nMy home room/algebra teacher also was a dick, which funny enough, the preaching lady replaced when he got fired after his first couple months. The guy talked to my parents during open house and they specifically asked if I was allowed to wear a studded bracelet and choker I had on, he told them \u201cI see absolutely no problem with it as long as it doesn\u2019t cause any problems.\u201d The very first moment of his class on my very first day of school he looked at me and said \u201cmam did we NOT already go over this in open house? Remove that NOW.\u201d The guy proceeded to start problems with kids every chance he could get as kind of a power move. He was fresh out of college 20 something year old with a serious chip on his shoulder and a serious issue with abusing authority over his students. He lasted less than 3 months in his very first year teaching because he was so mentally abusive. \n\nOne of my English teachers I really liked also tried to get my other English teacher fired when he saw me reading a book he didn\u2019t approve of. My current teacher had had a discussion with me about drugs and different effects they could have on people and we ended up talking about William s Burroughs. He was a heroin addict and you could tell through his writing when he was lucid and when he was high. I thought it was interesting, AND this was when perks of being a wallflower (the book not the movie) had gotten popular in my school and it\u2019s one of the special assignments he gets from his teacher in that book, so I was reading Naked Lunch. Well, the other English teacher and the world history teacher were very religious and highly homophobic. He stopped me and asked why I was reading that \u201ctrash\u201d I was excited to tell him about the discussion we had about being able to see the negative effects of drugs through his writing, and being able to identify the different styles. He immediately went to the school board and got her in trouble because he didn\u2019t like the fact that the man was gay. He could care less about the drugs. He was just highly upset because he was so homophobic. \n\nThe ironic part? The same homophobic guy went on to co-write a west side story like rendition of lysastrada where we got to play the roles of girlfriends of two street gangs that were at war, and hold back sex from our boyfriends until they quit fighting. Gay people aren\u2019t ok, but teaching a bunch of 10th grade girls that it\u2019s ok to use sex to get what you want and gang violence was ok to put on the table. Shit was a mess.\n\nI went to the principal twice with fist sized chunks of concrete that had been thrown at me, and showed the nurse and female asst principal the bruises that resulted from it, and nothing was done about it. But I got caught throwing a single French fry back at the kid that hit me with a handful of nuts and screws they pulled off the lunch room chairs and got suspended for \u201ctrying to incite a food fight\u201d because \u201cI got caught, he didn\u2019t.\u201d Despite me having a cut on my scalp from a screw. \n\nI know parents are sometimes right. Just the fact that the teacher didn\u2019t get away with being the bully in the past may have lead to the grudge later.",

Until the daughter of the superintendent joined our class, and said she wanted to try the drumset. The teacher was essentially just going to suck up to this kid because of her fathers position so I thought, what the hell, she gets first pick I guess. Then when we're in practice, the sheet calls for her to hit the ride, she's hitting the crash, everytime. I try to mention this to her, and she says \"why does it matter there's no difference anyways they're both cymbals\" then the teacher yelled at me for \"distracting her\" \n\nI stopped band after that",

Apparently making comments about a student's bodies in a negative and mocking way is strictly off limits.  They immediately transferred me out of the class, she then proceeded to fail the 5 of my friends that testified against her.  The school made her raise all of their grades to at least passing so she gave them all a C+. \n\n\nMy best friend had told me I was being absurd but I told him that I thought the teacher was mentally unwell and wanted out.

Usually by 14 they are able to say \"my mom is a nut job, I'm not going to do what she does.\" So yeah 8-12 really are the key years for teachers to pay very close attention to what is happening in a childs life, and what their behaviors are trending towards after that those behaviors may (not always, but often enough to be a concern) have permenenant or at least long term impact on the child.\n\nThis of course is all thanks to living in a country that realizes the issues of tomorrow can be mitigated or completely prevented by investing in the children of today.",

Same, bruh.\n\nHad a language teacher that was a real shit to everyone but the ones from her country. She met the eldest sibling, who had issues with lashing out when bullied. She grew the grudge then. First kid flunked that language ever single year after that.\n\nShe then met the second sibling, who behaved well, was quiet, well behaved (as prim as first grade middle schooler were), did their homework, never caused trouble, and generally well liked by the other teachers. She picked on them endlessly, and pulled second kid aside to humiliate them often. Same deal, flunked the language all the way past high school, where it was no longer necessary to score for it.\n\nI was the third kid. Same thing happened. Alienated and bullied. At that point in time, I had already developed social issues and tendency towards aggressive escalation. I remember this one exam, where the top score was 100%, second was 99.5%, third was me, 99%. Lost 1% from a missing full stop. They were praised to high heavens and I was singled out humiliated in front of the class. She practically threw my exam papers onto the floor. Luckily for her, I don't punch adults. The rest of my classmates though, weren't as lucky. Chivalry isn't dead...?\n\nFor us siblings, the first one gets passive aggressive, the second one gets snide, the third one gets *violent*. If the other kids didn't time their bullying to the moment the teacher arrives in class, I would have beaten more than a few unconscious. I was pretty poor at recognizing motivation, but what I *do* know was that young me would have continued beating and kicking them *until they stopped moving*. Which, in context, includes breathing.\n\nI never realized I was heading towards murder, but that was one of the starting factors that would eventually push me towards planning a school shooting years later. (I never managed to get the plan off the ground, so no worries, everyone was safe.)",

Later in 12th grade he told our class to go to hell, because some of the smarter students would make machine gun noises anytime anyone walked up to him or raised their hands to ask a question. The reason, he had a practice of shooting down their question by insisting students use the correct nomenclature.\n\nI went from being a 3.5GPA student in math to being a 1.5GPA student. Mainly due to fractions and his insistence on nomenclature use. Got into college and I was a 4.0 student helping others out with their math skills.\n\nHowever, I had the opposite experience when it comes to siblings, everyone loved my sister, so I always had the benefit of the doubt with teachers she had.\n\nSiblings can be a curse and a blessing no matter who they are or where you are in life.",

The whole poem is basically the narrator feeling bad for how terribly the guy was treated by the British and is full of examples of the horrible things the soldiers said to him, ending with the line \"you're a better man than I am Gunga Din'. \n\nThen someone made a film based vaguely on the poem. \n\nLater it became a racist shorthand for anyone who looked vaguely Indian, as in ignorant British people in an Indian restaurant might snap their fingers and go \"Oi! Gunga Din! More beer!\" A more modern equivalent might be calling him \"Apu\" after the Simpsons character. \n\nSo in this case, the teacher was basically saying, \"your name is \"too hard\" so I'm going to give you this name that ignorant fucks everywhere have assigned to people that look like you. You could well be of Pakistani origin rather than Indian, and were likely born in the US but you aren't a person in your own right in this class.\"",

The poem ends with Gunga Din saving an oppressive British soldier who used to torture him. In an act of selfless humanity, Gunga Din sacrifices his own life to save the soldier who used to physically and mentally torture and dehumanise him regularly. In the end, the soldier realises what he has done and says, \"You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din.\" \n\nSo the racist white teacher used the example of a brown man who sacrificed himself to save his white oppressor, to \"prove how she she was more superior than her brown student\" (who was of an entirely different religion, btw)",

Lactose intolerance in adulthood is most prevalent in people of East Asian descent, with 70 to 100 percent of people affected in these communities. Lactose intolerance is also very common in people of West African, Arab, Jewish, Greek, and Italian descent.\n\n**The prevalence of lactose intolerance is lowest in populations with a long history of dependence on unfermented milk products as an important food source.**\n\nhttps://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/lactose-intolerance/#frequency",

I knew I wasn't trying to compare people to animals, rather the methods of classification of dogs vs. humans, but some of the people I spoke to about it were offended by the implicit comparison non the less. It is not for me to decide whether or not someone else is offended, but I can decide a more sensible analogy.\n\nWith that being said, I don't wish to discuss the parallels between the two at length but I will say this, the classification of dog breeds is *not* scientific. The scientific classifications stops at Canis Familiaris.\n\nI am a fan of [this](https://evolution-outreach.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12052-019-0109-y) paper which takes a critical look at the similarities and differences of human races and dog breeds by bridging scientific literature with popular culture regarding race.\n\nThe fact of the matter is natural selection is not comparable to artificial selection. The genetic isolation of breeds is far more apparent in dogs than in humans based on geography, which in and of itself was not a huge barrier for sharing human genetic pools. Even then, neither differences in breed nor race are biologically enough to consider them genetic subgroups.\n\nHumans have always bred with neighboring tribes, as well as far away tribes to a lesser extent, adding foreign genetic diversity into local genetic pools. The genetic differences between breeds is just not comparable to the genetic differences between races.",

It is equally important because it allows us to to identify when our society is being subdivided in harmful ways, by people who answer no to the first question and assume one race has advantages over another in some area.\n\nAn example of this is when you said:\n\n>Genuinely, why do you think most of America\u2019s basketball teams are African?

But as I'm in Europe, I don't know too much about the issues faced in that part of the world, other than what you see on social media, in the news, and read in articles. I'm not saying that society is fair, I'm not saying that people are *treated* equally, I'm saying that every human child, no matter where it's born and how it appears, deserves the same universal membership in Club Earth, one planet. I know it's idealistic, and we'll never get there, but in 250, 500, 1000 years, maybe?\n\nAll I can do is try to do my part, like one ant out of a colony, in moving us towards a world where unity is the driving force, not diversity and adversity.",

It's an attempt to invalidate Native American cultures and dismiss them as inferior\u2014the exact same justifications used for the murder and torture used all the way into the 20th century.",

I'm saying she can't wear cultural clothing that she didn't earn.\n\n>How\u2019d you learn about racism in the US? Did they bring in slave owners? How about Nazis? Did they bring them in?\n\nNo, and they didn't dress up as enslaved people or Holocaust victims either. Because mimicking and stereotyping oppressed groups is wrong.\n\n>This is what teaching is. You have fuck-near zero resources and no money and you do your best to try to engage with your students. We still don\u2019t even know what all she did, we just see one snippet that makes her look ridiculous, which I think she may even acknowledge there in the end and y\u2019all take it out of context because you\u2019re fucking experts with cultural sensitivity and experts at judging someone\u2019s entire character by a 10 second clip of their life\n\nIf you can't teach without resorting to racist stereotypes, you don't deserve to teach.",

Is it racist to believe in a different cultures religion? \n\nI know this is a long shot, and incredibly unlikely but imagine a weird, overly enthusiastic individual who is a true believer. They may come off sounding like her. \n\nI know it\u2019s weird but there is a precedent for this. \nNon-Asians who practice Shinto and Buddhism exist. There are the Beta Jews which are Jewish people of Ethiopian / Somali descent, which is atypical. There is a small sect of Black Scotts that believe in Asatru. None of those are considered racist, most likely due to freedom of religion. \n\nThe reason I ask is because I have met a guy who was white, who believed wholeheartedly in Shinto. Built himself a shrine in his backyard, wore ceremonial garb, etc. but he was awkward, smelled funny, bought cheap katanas and Naruto ran everywhere\u2026 which at a cursory glance can come off as casual weeb racism. \n\nIs religion and religious beliefs exclusive to native believers. I.E. only ethnic Jews can be religious Jews, for example. \n\nIt\u2019s an interesting topic with no hard answer.",

There's tons of ways to do math, there's no \"right way\". At the end of the day, the way that gets the answer effectively is a right way.  What is most undoubtedly wrong is a teaching method that makes kids thinks that math is hard and they aren't good at it.\n\nI can respect that some ways are better for people than other ways, and exposure to many ways in order to find those best ways for each student or different situations. I competed in math competitions throughout school, so I employed many math techniques, but one that involves significant writing on paper should never be forced on anyone who can do math in more effective ways.  \n\n\nI also have a problem with how some topics are taught (or avoided) to cater to some groups of people. Then as adults, these people are missing information to make well informed decisions. You can see it everyday in arguments on social media.\n\nWhether its regional or national doesn't really matter at all.

It's like if a history teacher were to dress in slave clothes and blackface to teach kids about slavery.  It's inappropriate for the classroom and can offend many students even if the teacher was initially well intentioned. She should be told not to do similar things in the future and should apologize to the class and explain why what she did was inappropriate.",

In other words - remember the principle, not the mnemonics. It's more universal. It will train you to figure things on your own, which is undoubtedly a useful skill, and might lead you to find something nobody else found.\n\nWhat's much more important for our era (and what nobody is teaching) is how to find information efficiently, and how to recognize misinformation.

Am machinist, in an apprenticeship shop. \n\nThe mnemonic helps to remember when first being introduced, to ease working towards understanding of the principle. Its only for beginners or classrooms where the concept is being taught. You use it over till you no longer need it, that's the entirety of its purpose.\n\nIts a complicated enough relationship that it's not readily grasped and for most people they need to work the problems back and forth till it becomes second nature. The order of said relationship matters, much like PEMDOS. Mnemonics are a still necessary human invention because understanding is not instantaneous, and said understanding needs to be innate within and not on a paper in a book.\n\nIf you're googling every time you need triangle math you don't understand the relation needed to set up the function. Certainly ain't gonna teach a trick for complicated mathematics governed by geometric principles for answers I need now to manufacture a part correctly on time when the instance does not always apply.

It arose, in some big ways, from Natives trying to break into Anthropology in order to write our own history, instead of being treated like national geographic subjects. As in, \"You can't just tell us what your culture is, you have be studied like strange animals and let us come to strange conclusions.\" The anthropology scene didn't like Natives trying to undermine it, and that new, more or less social rule came into being; it's only real if it's told by an outsider. It spread. Very recent stuff, and also only recently being undone. IE: artifacts and human remains being returned from museums and universities in the last five years.  \n  \nPersonally, I don't have much faith in \"people\" who say shit like you experienced when in areas near reservations. Too much racism. They have their own bias, and they *need* you to be undone in order to maintain their narrative.",

Then some guy found the fossils / bones of said bird and suddenly it was now real. \n\nI have so many ridiculous / enraging stories, as I'm sure you do as well. My name is nature related (you can guess from my tag, Anishinaabeg) so sometimes people in town wouldn't believe my name and kept asking me what my real name was, super aggressive and all. Fed up I told them in Anishinaabemowin. No joke, dude told me to literally go back to fucking Europe if I wanted to speak different languages and shit, that he was a real American and to get that shit out of his country. His friend realized at that point and then they all just sort of stood around looking awkward and then walked away. The one guy apologized for his friend. \n\nAll the on-rez cats used to laugh their asses off at us and say they didn't know why we even bothered to live off the rez. Fortunately things have gotten so much better since then for the tribe in general. Its good to hear your are working for yours! I heard about the progress on the Crazy Horse Memorial awhile back..still a ways off I hear.   \n\n\nThanks for your time / replies, it made me happy!",

In my opinion, you can advocate for the removal of those things without advocating for the removal of faith altogether. \n\nMy point is: I think people should be allowed to believe that they want. They should not be allowed to violate others rights based on their beliefs.

And I specifically asked for the thing you believe that would be the easiest for me to shit on. And if I said anything about it, it's likely you wouldn't like it. So yeah, your self-protection here is very understandable. Thanks for being honest about it. Most folks with organized religious beliefs aren't able to manage any level of honesty about their reasons for believing or the core of their beliefs. \n\n\n>Do you know any of my moral opinions? Or have you possibly assumed them? \n\nI have not assumed anything about your beliefs, that's why I asked. I put in that religious beliefs can be used to promote atrocities simply to say why, in general, they should be avoided. Non-organized religion is harder to weaponize just because the groups are smaller and often have to be manipulated individually, and thus take more effort to manipulate. But it's still an attack vector into the person's mind, even if it is less attractive because you can't attack a hundred million minds at once. \n\n\n>I've experienced the most religious hate and mockery in my life from atheists. If demonizing other religions is a religious thing, then I think many atheists are leaning more towards religious behaviors than they realize.\n\n\nThat is an interesting perspective. But I disagree with the unstated premise that helping someone realize their religious belief is unfounded is a bad idea. Religious people d this to others in order to then infect them with their own religious ideas. Atheists (in my experience) do it with the intent that the person will then become immune to more types of nonsensical and unfounded beliefs. \n\n\n>The right to freedom of religion is a human right, and it should be as long as it doesn't infringe on other's human rights.\n\nYes. But religion has a nearly perfect record of ALWAYS infringing on others' human rights. \n\n\n\n>That means that if you're an atheist and you support the tearing down of religion and the social and/or legal removal of religion as a whole, then you are advocating for removing a human right.\n\nNo. Quite to the contrary, I think that compulsory teaching children about the world religions when they're between the ages of 6 and 15 would be GREAT. Children need to see that there are lots of styles of belief systems. We don't need to tell them that any particular one is right or wrong, presumably their parents will do that. But they need to know there are other beliefs so that they can put their own religion into context. \n\n\n>Granted, this is more complicated because countless religions have human rights violations written into them and many followers still play it out.\n\ndamn straight. \n\n> In my opinion, you can advocate for the removal of those things without advocating for the removal of faith altogether.\n\nAgreed. But that brings up the question, if people can \"use\" faith to believe that they should commit atrocities, doesn't that mean that faith can be used to believe literally anything, regardless of how wrong or harmful? And if something like faith can be \"used\" in such a way, why would we not do all we can to get rid of it by convincing people it's a really bad way of choosing what to believe. \n\n>My point is: I think people should be allowed to believe that they want.\n\nI've never understood this statement. We have no way of stopping a person from believing something other than by presenting them with very good reasons to NOT believe those things. \n\n\n>There are people who hurt no one with their religious beliefs, and I don't think it's acceptable to punish the entirety of religious people based on the (admittedly disgusting) acts of others.\n\nIf a particular religious belief is incorrect, in what sense is it punishment to make it very clear to people who hold that belief that it is incorrect (or, as is often the case, incoherent)?  \n\nAn example: If a person believes erroneously they'll be reunited with their family after death (for this paragraph let's both agree that nothing about a person survives their death), would it not be doing them a favor by showing them how we know there's no way for that to be true, so that they'll realize that they should cultivate those relationships now, while they're alive? Helping a person see this, or perhaps helping all people who are Hindu see this, would help the individual. But in the case of all Hindus, it would help get rid of the caste system. I say this to point out that disabusing people of religiously-held wrong notions is not a punishment.",

If a religion, for example, is teaching women they are second class citizens, then yes I agree that they should be told that's not true. That's because it's violating their human rights.\n\nIf a person believes they will live after death, or believes in God, or anything at all, then no, it's not acceptable in my opinion to attempt to \"teach\" them to feel differently. That belief is not violating anyone's right and it's arrogant to attempt to prove them wrong in some way. It's punishment if you don't understand what religion is to people. It's an incredibly deep, personal thing. To many, their religion is a part of their family and apart of their entire world.\n\nWhen you advocate for \"teaching\" people that they're wrong and to feel differently than they do, you're saying you want to destroy a part of them. You disrespect them. Regardless of whether you think it's a positive thing in their life or not, it's simply not your life to decide.\n\nYou have the right to say what you want. But if you want people to start being more open minded regarding religion, then you need to open your own mind first. Why should we listen to you? Why are you talking down to us like we need to be taught by you? Maybe you have something to learn from us instead. No one wants to listen to someone who thinks they're smarter than them.\n\nThe proper answer is to make science widely accessible. All schools should teach evolution and natural sciences. My high school biology class discussed where religion could fit with science and we were never told that our beliefs are \"incoherent\" and that we should stop believing. We were told that we absolutely can believe and that it's good to think critically about science and religion existing together and how that feels to us individually. Things like this will allow people to see all the sides of the situation and make their own choice. I don't believe parents should be pressuring their kids to follow a religion, and I don't think teachers or anyone else should be pressuring them not to either.\n\nWhat this comes down to is whether you feel you should decide what's healthy in someone else's life and if you feel it's acceptable for you to push that opinion onto them. I personally believe that unless the person is harming others, then no, you shouldn't be pushing that opinion on anyone. Sure, you have the right to within reason - but that will greatly lower my respect for you as a person and I certainly won't be taking your advice.",

What aspects of their faith tradition do you think are FACTUALLY wrong? \n\n\n\n>There are thousands of religions across the globe, many of which are so closely tied with culture that removing faith would destroy culture.\n\n\nAnd seriously, you haven't even said what you mean by \"faith\". And please, please, please tell me some aspect of a culture that can ONLY be believed on / adhered to,  because of / according to      faith. \n\n\nThe best examples I can come up with are mutilating baby boys' penises shortly after birth because you think a god told you to do it. Well, that's not right. In America, people do it because their doctor tells them it's good for the baby, and they'll just believe the doctor without bothering to think that, you know, the penis evolved to have that foreskin there, as evidenced by the fact that basically all mammals have it.    Regardless, anything that can only be believed or adhered to by faith has no inherent value. Because otherwise, you'd justify it using that inherent value. \n\n\nSo seriously, describe fore me something that YOU think is valuable that would disappear without faith, and why it disappearing would be bad, seeing as how it has not enough value to be carried on without faith?",

I'm willing to put a lot of money on the first. That said, students and young people today are also pretty aware so both really don't need to engage in this other than to bring it all back up about the dirty past. That matter is obviously hairy, and probably best to leave it up to people of these cultures in some organized way to decide if we need to remind ourselves of what people of the past were doing.   \n\n\nI think the ultimate yawn and ignorance here is to assume this is a video of a teacher who is acting racist and so insensitive to even add that \"all these things from this culture are obviously ridiculous\". That is probably the mouth breathing angle to take, but maybe many here do breath through the mouth.",

Personally, I didn't consider my comment to be particularly \"woke\" as much as it was just pointing out her bizarre commentary. Regardless, judging from your question I'd hope we can have a civil conversation about it regardless. I definitely prefer not to argue over the usual bullshit, it's all been done.\n\nUnfortunately, unless you live in areas the reservations were placed, most people haven't even *met* any Natives. I lived in Massachusetts for a while and was treated like a unicorn haha.\n\nWhat it comes down to, really, is that the lack of exposure can serve to further ingrain these weird, old, chicken dance type habits. None of these acts are even remotely accurate representations, nor are they based in a representation that was accurate to begin with. Luckily, the strange and convoluted perceptions of Natives, as we've been satirized over generations, is relatively quickly coming to a stop. It'll take a while to stop completely, but it's not nearly as bad as it was even five or ten years ago. Public shaming is... sadly, a powerful (good or bad) way to influence. You'd be surprised how many people out there legitimately \"didn't know it was wrong\" because of the caricatures that have been everywhere, this whole time. *Peter-fucking-Pan* has the caricatures. Is this lady overtly racist? Probably not. She did likely grow up seeing the caricatures everywhere, and likely has a tendency towards being one of those teachers that's silly or \"out there\" and it just didn't work in this context. I do feel bad that she's going to get raked over the coals for being out of touch. At the same time, I know exactly the deep sense of hurt and embarrassment that comes from being a Native kid, watching a person of authority perform in this way.\n\nThe / in tribal/cultural is because my job crosses quite a few areas, internal and external politics, as well as creative projects and social impact. I've consulted and am co-writing with an author who is referencing my tribe, as well as on documentaries for cultural sensitivity, history and language usage. I have also consulted medical providers on how to donate or provide or sell equipment, temp and long term alternative housing projects. I've consulted tribal officials on how to find alternative housing that fits their needs, or most recently, things like ventilators and covid tests and popup hospitals, and online schooling through google classroom. During the election, we assisted the DNC by providing insight for reaching Native communities, and we're currently working out logistics on if we're attending the climate meeting next week or not. It's all over the place, but as we joke about, Native Country is like, 12 people, and we're only just now getting an influx of experts in various fields as the post-boarding-school-generation graduates from college. How to communicate with tribes, and how to help tribes communicate/access outside resources, is a field of study on its own.",

I'd agree if you said something along the lines of: \"Some people might find wrongful caricatures of their culture offensive.\" When you say it's \"wrong\", you're setting your own standard for what you believe ought to be permissible and what shouldn't. If you YouTube: \"Native ritual\", \"Natives Dancing\", etc., you'll find hundreds of different styles of seemingly authentic natives performing their own unique tribal rituals. I guess I'm a little confused as to what sets your standard for who is allowed to perform what and on what basis, or who is allowed to pass such judgements? I personally find it more \"wrong\" telling someone they can't do a certain thing because of their race/ background/ skin color; to me, that seems more \"racist\".\n\nYour last paragraph implies that your line of work heavily revolves around melding the gap of disparity between natives and non natives. I find it wholesome that different communities are willing to work together. However, my understanding is that the whole point of Native Americans demanding reservations was to completely limit the intrusion of the outside world onto their ways of life? It seems like most natives take pride in being independent from the overarching society, free to make their own rules/ laws how they see fit. I guess the idea of reservations and trying to do \"outreach\" seem a little contradictory. If you try and ingrain society with native life, some will claim that you're overimposing. If you give them what they want and leave them alone, others will claim neglect and disparity. Seems like not matter what \"the white man\" does, it's going to be considered \"bad\" by somebody.",

Let me share what I just said to someone else\u2026.\n\n\nI\u2019m watching videos on mute while trying to contain a toddler, I didn\u2019t study the sheets they\u2019re holding.\n\nPlease understand, all I saw is a teacher who appeared to be trying, which is a lot for a job that\u2019s underpaid and under-appreciated. Then I saw a bunch of people get uppity and over sensitive, saying someone (who I thought was genuinely trying) was racist and a piece of shit. All from a bunch of goobers probably subbed to r/antiwork.\n\nWith more context, I see that this was in poor taste, but nobody gave me that context until after a deep dive. Maybe they could have said \u201cX, that she is doing, is wrong and outdated.\u201d Not act like this woman should be fucking hung, although they seem to know her heart fully, somehow.\n\nI challenge all y\u2019all armchair judges to go try to teach and see how it works out for you. I still don\u2019t think this woman had hateful intentions, she actually likely had good intentions and should be applauded for at least trying where many don\u2019t. She does need to bring her lesson plans to date though, because we live in way to sensitive times where people will literally ruin your life for an honest mistake like this.",

It was very racist.  And there should in fact be disciplinary action. \n\nAnd as someone who has been an adjunct professor, challenge accepted. I have taught and I understand that she was trying to reach her students. But being racist is not an a sortable way to do that. \n\nHaving previously don\u2019t the research on this issue( and not just armchair judging) this story has been used for years as \u201cThe Legend of SOH-CAH-TOA\u201d. It is a fantasy sometimes features a smart young boy (often the son of \u201cChief Pythagorus\u201d) or an  \u201cIndian princess\u201d. It implies that the tribe was advanced because of their innate understanding of trigonometry. But it often frames the protagonist as unnecessarily angry (almost savage). In most versions his anger gets to he better of him and he kicks a rock. So he needs to soak his toe. While doing that, he solved a problem. And since he gained his wisdom while soaking his toe, he was renamed Chief SOH-CAH-TOA. \n\nCool story bro. \n\nBut this is about indigenous peoples as having uncontrollable tempers, being a little more civilized than than contemporaries because they used western style math (the acronym is based on English, even though the math itself is not), and mocking the cultures\u2019 naming practices to make a racist pun. This whole story is meant to make it easier to remember the basics of trig. \n\nThere are much easier ways to make people remember trig without a made up racist story, about indigenous people succeeding because of their adoption of western principles, all based on the initialism sounding vaguely like the gibberish someone would use while imitating indigenous languages. It\u2019s both racist and incredibly lazy. \n\nThis person took that and dialed it up to eleven. The headdress she\u2019s appropriating is used in religious ceremonies and has great meaning. Hers mocks it. The dance she\u2019s doing is also an attempt to recreate something culturally significant. The chant is so he same. Especially chanting SOH-CAH-TOA, which in mathematics is absolutely fine, but in the context of this story is absolutely not. The getting on the desk and pretending to pray to a \u201cwater spirit\u201d is probably the most offensive part. It is analogous to a non-Muslim mockingly pretending to pray towards Mecca for a cheap laugh. \n\nShe also lives in a place where there is a large population of what is left of the indigenous peoples that this story uses mockingly to make a very weak pun-based point. She should know better. She may not have realized what she did was offensive, but that might be just as big if a problem. She needs some serious training if this is how she teaches. Notice how none of her students are even engaging with it. She\u2019s being knowingly or not, super racist, to deliver a pun, in an attempt to create engagement and it\u2019s not even working. Fails on every level. \n\nIf she has a past of being racist, she should be fired. If she\u2019s somehow just SUPER ignorant, she should absolutely be sent for training while on leave. This behavior is unacceptable. \n\nBut I do agree with you. If it was stupidity, and not malice, behind this cringeworthy display, she shouldn\u2019t lose her job. I do sympathize with her. But the ignorance on display is vast and must be corrected. We need to trust the people teaching our children. Teaching lazy racism in math class is just not acceptable.",

As a society we make rules based on them. I assume that you don't support murder even though you're not religious, right?\n\nThen great, you understand how it works then. It's simply a moral code.

Or morals. Atheists can be people with morals most people would agree with, or they can be cruel monsters. This isn\u2019t BECAUSE they\u2019re atheists. It\u2019s because of things they already believe. The lack of a belief in a deity or supernatural power doesn\u2019t figure into it. So again, it\u2019s not like a religion.

The only thing that makes me *not* atheist is that I do believe in a higher power of some sort. I don't believe in a dogma and there is no requirements for me to be a spiritual/religious/whatever person except for believing in something.\n\nAgain, when I said \"practically like a religion\" I wasn't talking about the rules of religion. I was talking about how the majority of atheists you'll meet all have the same opinions on religion (that it's shit and that everyone who practices it is shit) and to me, that's very similar to some of the practices of organized religion. (Ex. X religion thinking other religion is bad and so is everyone who follows it.)\n\nIt's exhausting. And depressing, actually. Because I literally can't have a conversation with an atheist anymore without getting shit on. In previous times I've been nothing but gentle and had nothing bad to say about atheism or atheists, but then I just could never speak to one without being told what a delusional piece of shit I am. They'd never ask or care about my opinions or what I actually believe in. I could agree with them morally on almost every level. But as long as I'm not atheist, I'm a stupid brainwashed pile of shit. Both online and in real life relationships.\n\nAnd the thing is, this is considered normal because organized religion has had such nasty history and connotations. An atheist giving me shit without even knowing me is socially acceptable now. So yeah. Not against atheism in general, but I'm wary of most of them until they make it clear they don't want to remove the right to religious freedom.

I realized that religion is a huge part of culture, that it's a deeply personal thing, and that it's a human right. I changed my behavior and mindset and now I'm disgusted by all of it.\n\nSo that's why it bothers me that most atheists I've met, haven't moved past that point yet. They're still in that angry hateful mindset and haven't gained the awareness. And now, hilariously, I'm a target of the own hate I used to spew. Guess that's what I deserve but my point still stands. Many atheists are just as toxic as religious purists and they don't even realize it. My comments are polarizing to them because they don't want to accept it.",

They often asking how atheists can have moral while don't have god who makes them follow the rules. Like the children who behave only when the parent looking on them.\n\nSaying that morals is the religious rules is like to say that laws are religions rules or empathy towards other living beings is religious. Religious people or not you still should comply with the laws. And same with morals. Some people would do it because they fear of consequences: from god, from society or from law. Some people would do it because they have strong moral compass and they own feel what's right. So religion can be an instrument of coercion, but the very concept of morality is non-religious.",

My high school biology class even had a discussion about how religion could fit after we learned about the big bang theory. How could any kid get taught about big scientific concepts like that and not experience *any* questioning or doubt about their beliefs? Again, I don't think people just shouldn't believe (obviously - I'm not atheist) but it's just confusing to me.\n\nKeep in mind I'm from the Northeast US. Christianity isn't shoved into school nearly as much here. No teacher I've ever had has said anything majorly Christian or religious around me, and school was very liberal. One of my male teachers dressed in drag and danced with another male teacher during a school event, just for shits and giggles. So maybe I'm uninformed on how most US teachers behave.",

I understand that belief is important to a lot of people's sense of comfort and place in the world. It's also a defining part of countless cultures. People deserve to have that. \n\nReligion becomes a problem when it affects human rights, and unfortunately, the majority do. When many atheists use that same hateful mindset to shame, mock, and demonize every religious person, and advocate for the social or legal removal of religious freedom, then I consider them to be equally toxic. A lot of atheists consider themselves morally superior or that they have moral high ground over religious people, and thus don't realize they are a part of the same problem.\n\nI'm not anti-atheist at all.

Skin color doesn\u2019t mean anything to me it\u2019s just a color \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I think all people are equal so i treat everyone the same.\n\nThe people that are afraid to say the word black are people who are racist. They look down on black people and think of themselves as so much better that they live in constant guilt/fear that others are going to find out so they spend their life trying to prove how not racist they are. They think that if they constantly point out racism then no one would ever think THEY are racist. \n\nThey are the equivalent of Edgar Allan Poe and their racism is the heart beating under the floor. \n\nPedophiles do the same thing. They jerk off watching kids and then join all these pedophile hunting groups so no one suspects them. They can keep a computer filled with child porn but it\u2019s for \u201cresearch\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s always White liberals too. The ones who are screaming the loudest about racism are the biggest racist of all. The average liberal thinks that blacks are so useless they couldn\u2019t possibly get ahead unless THEY HELP",

Which of course is a trademark feature of white privilege, and which I recognize as a systemic problem, but also in my experience here in Germany it's just less of a life-threatening issue on day to day basis. On the contrary to your assumption however, I don't think at all that racism shouldn't be called out - I think it should be called out and talked about a lot. Which Germany does. The city of Berlin has recently launched a campaign raising awareness of positive racism specifically, because that is what's much more prevalent here. My main point of interest here was protecting the notion that teachers are sometimes forced to make fools of themselves and not always for the guaranteed benefit of the lesson, which is what had stung me the most - the sheer amount of cringe. As I said in my original comment, whether they are racist or just an idiot did not concern me, but instead I was much more likely to subscribe to some of the other observations ITT: obnoxious; insensitive; culturally deaf.\n\nBut anyway my assumptions that it was the student(s) who have uploaded the video were wrong:\n\n> Speaking to\u00a0Newsweek,\u00a0Brown, who is of Kanaka-Maoli and Taos Pueblo descent, explained that she posted the video with the boy's permission so the world \"could have a small glimpse into the type of abuses Native children face in U.S. schools everyday. This is not a one off scenario... \"We're standing up for our children and setting new a standard for the treatment of Native people.\"\n\nSo this defeats my argument that students should seek council before uploading to the internet. This student did seek council with a person who they trusted (an activist from what I understand) and it was them who wanted to upload the video. This makes it a lot more about racism than I originally interpreted. I think they handled it the right way and I stand corrected.",

It definitely captures what it would be like to live inside a mentally disturbed persons mind. More so than something like Foot Fist Way, which was like watching a mentally disturbed person from across the room. \n\nEither way, I\u2019m always happy when Jody Hill is working on something new.",

Loved everyone, not racist in the slightest, had a baby with an African woman after this incident. One day, during a bad rain storm, he came home and the wind had blown down the American flag. He experienced a break. He suddenly was convinced the next door neighbors were Muslim and had taken the flag down and thrown it in the mud. He picked up the flag and started waving it furiously screaming \u201cWE WILL NOT BE SILENCED! WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED!\u201d It took us(his wife and me) over a half hour to just get him to come inside and he didn\u2019t fully calm down for many hours.

I worry that either he will seriously injure or kill someone during a break or that someone will shoot him because it\u2019s the only way to take him down. I wouldn\u2019t actually blame them for doing so because he is terrifying to behold when he\u2019s in a rage and, again, I don\u2019t think anything else would take him down.

I have been your friend for over a decade, I have helped you raise your children.

It's a rough gig!!! But we'd be in one hell of a mess without it. \n\nWhenever I make a mistake, I go straight to my manager and talk to them. I have a wonderful one, thank goodness. We work out the issue together as a team and make corrections where possible.

When the nurses and CNAs complained that we were being overworked with our assignments (CNAs were being given 14 or more patients each shift because of staff shortages. And we were non-union), administration straight up said \"it's legal for us to give nurses 40 patients at a time and CNAs 20 each. Be happy we aren't doing that.\"\n\nI realized pretty quickly that I probably have some sort of generalized anxiety issue and noped myself out of that. I'm still under the impression hospitals do have it worse with all those acute patients even if it's much fewer of them.

She may have been a pushover in that respect, but I can't blame her, I wasn't there. As her friend, I wasn't going to armchair quarterback her life choices before she met me.\n\nMy point is that more often than you know, some people get pushed into professions that were not their choice, but that were \"expected\", and they may not always excel in them.",

Like think about Germany.\n\nSome people dislike Germany, because their country got conquered by them in the second world war. Other people dislike them because of the holocaust, while Greece dislike them for the way their debt crisis was handled. Go back a hundred years and Denmark would hate them for the war of 1864, the French would hate them because of the unification wars and a lot of africans would hate them because of their genocide. Go back another hundred years and the french will hate them for the napolonic wars. So why does people hate germans? Lots of reasons.\n\nI live in Denmark. Two kinds of jews used to live here. German and spanish jews. Few had problems with the spanish jews, who had been invited by the king. The german jews on the other hand faced much discrimination, because they were germans.\n\nIn some countries jews were a big part of the banking industry and thus hated like most other bankers. Palestinians hate them because of Israel. Some extreme christians hate them because the jews killed christ. Jews have historical been spread out and a minority in many countries, which have given many countries reason to hate them.\n\nIt should be noted that there is no good reason to hate jews as a group.",

I guess because I came from poverty and a lot of teachers come from solidly middle class households. imo, the main issue with teaching isn't the pay, but the workload and lack of support from administration.\n\nClass sizes are too big to be able to adequately help your students, the curricula is increasingly like a flowchart that a robot could follow, and we have to serve as social workers on top of teaching because schools don't hire enough counselors and our society in general doesn't hire enough social workers.\n\nRegardless, I still find it rewarding. Working at the grocery store, getting carts from the lot, stocking shelves, bagging groceries repeatedly for hours all made my body ache when I got home and I felt like nothing I did had any meaning. Now, I go home and my soul aches a bit but I feel like what I do is important and helps society.",

                  "text": "I remember two instances I would like to share of this. I'm 42 so these stories take place a long time ago. \n\nI was in kindergarten going on first grade ( US ) the first time this happened. I was very poor when I was young, my mom was a single mom of 3, and we lived in the projects. Apparently the school district I went to had completely filled 1st grade classes and had an overflow, not enough room for students, so they looked for a reason to send kids to the pre-first class that was under-filled instead. I was one of those students ( I would like to point out an ironic fact, my IQ is actually very respectable, and I was placed in advanced placement classes for the rest of my schooling ). This was early 80's. The statement given, and I believe my mother still has it, was that I had not managed to use cursive handwriting \" To a satisfactory manor \"  and needed extra instruction in handwriting.\n\nPlease let that sink in. Yes, I was held back a YEAR, from FIRST GRADE, because my HANDWRITING wasn't up to snuff. Also please remember I was like 5 to 6 years old at this time.\n\nSo I went to pre-first as a poor young white kid. My pre-first teacher, I SWEAR I wish I could find her ( I have TRIED ), just made me the worst of everything. I remember thinking as a 5+ year old \" why does this lady hate me, what did I do to make her not like me so much? \"\n\nI caught lice, and not because I was dirty, believe me my mother was MORTIFIED, but I got it none the less. This teacher made me come to the front of the class, and BTW I wasn't the FIRST to get it, but she made me come to the front of the class, as she checked me, declared I had bugs in my hair, and then made me sit in the corner IN FRONT OF EVERYONE LIKE I HAD DONE SOMETHING WRONG, until my mother came to get me. I will NEVER forget how HUMILIATED I was, and why I asked myself WHY, as a young child I just didn't understand ( OH I DO NOW, FUCK that bitch, she shaped my life and not in a good way. She just hated poor people, and I WAS FIVE, like I had a choice in the matter ), what was going on. \n\nSo that was my first experience with a rotten teacher.\n\n( I want to interject here that as a 42 year old in AP when I was a kid I loved almost ALL of my teachers, I just remember these two as standouts because they just sucked so much )\n\nMy 2nd time was in 10th grade, in AP Calc. I had a teacher whom well, I just DIDN'T like, and she equally didn't like me. She would ask me questions like she though I didn't know the answer when she asked the class, and then she got mad when I got them right. Basically there was nothing I could do to make this women happy with me no matter what I did. So let's make a long story short, at the end of the year I went to hand my textbook in ( both you and the teacher had to sign when in got turned in ), and she got nasty with me, and I basically told her I didn't give a shit anymore because  she was no longer my teacher. Fast forward a day and I get called to the principles office and I am being charged with NOT turning in my textbook. A 100USD Dollar fine ( at the time, who the hells know what it is for inflation anymore ), AND a possible expulsion. Now here is the kicker, when I turned in the textbook and she sigened it in front of me, I WATCHED HER AS SHE PLACED IT ON THE SHELF. So when the Principal said there was no evidence that I was right, I told him to follow me, walked right down to the classroom, and pulled out that textbook with both my name AND her name signed on it. When he asked her about it she said something along the lines if \" he most have forged it, or I I don't remember doing it ).\n\nThe miraculous part about all this, she got fired for what she did to me, and I never even asked for it. It was wrong, I didn't do anything to HER, or anything WRONG, and there is no reason for TEACHERS to behave this way.\n\nAnyway have fun with my 2 drunken late night ramblings and why you should listen to kids when they bitch about why their teachers might suck.\n\nAND I MEAN SUCK.",

To reply, it was not about me not being able to do cursive, that is just what they SAID was the reason. The real reason was because all first grade classes were overfilled but pre-first was under filled, so they came up with any reason to ship kids off to pre-first as they could. Since I was a poor youth from the projects and a poor background, I was deemed dumb and therefore should be shipped off to special classes, simply since my cursive sucked.\n\nIn High school I took AP classes fyi, and I was always around a year or so older then my classmates. I ALWAYS knew why growing up. Thankfully the NY Dep. Of Edu. started looking at how smart I was, and not how RICH I was, after a few years into grade school.",

There's some truth to it. As a general concept, I'm not very fond of children, but I find my students fascinating. It's a proximity thing, I suppose. \n\nTeaching can quickly cause burnout and resentment and it's hard to disengage when it's the only job you've ever had, but teachers really need to know when to pull the ripcord and either retire or start a second career. Everyone needs to vent, there are days when kids aggravate the shit out of you, and there are students that you're just never going to get along with. When that isn't the exception is when you need to think about other plans because you're hurting yourself and the kids.",

He wouldn't keep up with how students were doing and yet at the end of the year as we were putting together our exhibition, he would start bossing around and make changes and make people cry, because he only cared about how it would make him look if the exhibition wasn't perfect. And I could go on about him.\n\nBut yeah, basically, he is not the type of person who has a passion for teaching, for guiding other people, for passing on his knowledge. No, he's bitter he's got to do this job just because his mediocre paintings didn't make him successful.",

She would get extremely angry if we pointed out that we'd already done something or if anyone asked a question. One day she said that Africa was a country and the countries in it were states, and a student tried to correct her and she doubled down hard and got extremely erratic and upset - just screaming at the student what a dumbass they were.

We all had to do push-ups, after he screamed at us 9-year-olds. I don't know how or why anymore, but he singled me out in the aftermath, having me do crazy stuff again, for instance, making fun of me, then having me stand in front of class for significant time without actually doing something, but mostly push ups for the slightest of his perceived infringements - it got worse when my parents fought for me by taking these stories to the head of the school. He also played military marches during tests. He got transferred after the schoolyard ended to another school, and I heard he got removed as a teacher shortly after, but that year was not nice.\n\nI had enjoyed school the first two years, and I enjoyed it afterwards. But I can't say I have any fun memory from that third year. Hm - the class teacher from our first two years was pretty great, and had been around for decades (my class was the last before retirement). When I got home after college, I visited her in the old people's home a few times, and sometimes met other former pupils of her. I somehow can't imagine anyone was sorry the 3rd grade teacher had to leave - what a contrast.",

It's probably fair to say that there should have been support coming from the government to help ease the reentry for the people who work these job, but that's a tall order for a country that has their public school classrooms filled with a headcount of over 25 kids to a single teacher.\n\nanyway, many layers to an onion and you can peel them all away, but you're still left with a racist karen that should know better to not kowtow while wearing a native headdress in front of high schoolers.",

They are mostly considered \u201cwhite\u201d now. They changed the logo/mascot for the previously-named Washington Redskins, but nobody is outraged by Chef Boyardee or Mario\u2019s voice. This is like blackface versus dressing as Luigi for Halloween.\n\nI agree that a lot of people who point at cultural appropriation are actually pigeonholing instead of liberating. When you say things like \u201cBruno Mars is appropriating black music\u201d it\u2019s like, what would you like him to play? What style do you consider acceptable for his racial and cultural background? *That* is a case of people being so \u201cwoke\u201d that it\u2019s actually 360 degree shitty. But this is not that. Whether or not she means offense isn\u2019t really relevant here. She\u2019s not respectfully educating a class about history or traditions.

That God created the world with words so words are the most powerful thing and we must be careful how we use them. That we must respect a person's culture and tradition because that is a big part of who you are and without tradition society would fall apart. And that you must always put yourself in someone else's shoes and see how they feel, because being 'technically right' is not enough. You should try to be GOOD and KIND.\n\nI don't think that if someone makes one mistake they should lose their job and all their friends. I don't think its okay for people to shout and scream at each other in public. And I don't think people should make an effort to hunt for misunderstandings taken out of context. I also generally think people should be able to express their opinions even if they are offensive, but if someone threatens or directly insults someone else you can shut them down because that in itself sabotages the conversation.\n\nBefore 2016, these ideas lived peacefully in my head. The first set were called being polite and socially adjusted, and the second set were called being tolerant and patient. Nowadays, if you believe in being polite, culturally sensitive and careful with words, that means you are a sensitive woke SJW who is too scared of being cancelled to say anything at all. And if you believe in the second you are a bigot who doesn't truly understand the damage that words can do.\n\nThis is just a long winded way to say thay long before 'woke' became what the word means today, people still believed in respect for other cultures and being polite. The fact that you have to prefix your statement with an apology for sounding woke is so sad.",

Sure, it\u2019s less rare for them to be leads now, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a director wanting to do it if they are written well, like the protagonist of _Alien._ On the other hand I am confused why I was lumped with the alt-right by social media because I criticized the new Star Wars movies, especially the first one.

Or even saying they were wrong just to get out of losing their job but still internally agreeing with themselves. \n\nThis teacher didn\u2019t make a \u201cmistake\u201d. A mistake is grading incorrectly or honestly even having a bad day due to something happening outside of work and accidentally bringing to work. That can be corrected and the person can and should reflect on the mistake and work hard to not do it again. In the future something they can\u2019t get over they should talk to their boss and get the day off to adjust. That\u2019s called being responsible (bosses who don\u2019t understand when the person is sincere and not faking are shit bosses so let\u2019s not bring up anything about people taking advantage or whatever). \n\nWhat this teacher did though isn\u2019t a mistake though as far as we can tell. It\u2019s a mistake if the context is that she is trying to teach students why it\u2019s offensive and show a bad example of how history portrayed native Americans because that\u2019s her going about it wrong. It\u2019s not a mistake if she\u2019s serious which it really seems she is.",

A bad title and thumbnail can make even the best video in the world never get seen, because no one will ever click it to see the content.

AT BEST, what this teacher did was participate in a culturally insensitive spectacle to try to leave a strong imprint of a pneumonic device. AT WORST, what she did was act out her own blatant racism thinking she could be shielded by the excuse of it being a teaching lesson. What it absolutely is not, however, is violence. There is a big problem with the \u201cwoke\u201d crowd in America misusing the word violence. And there\u2019s an intentionality behind it. You can justify a wide range of reactions to something if they are in response to violence being committed against you. You cannot justify nearly as many of those potential reactions if they are because, \u201csomeone did something that I found offensive.\u201d\n\nObviously the main take away from this video is that this teacher acted completely inappropriately and should, at a minimum, face serious disciplinary consequences from the school administration. The quote in the title of the video, however, opens up another important conversation.",

It\u2019s been FAIRLY informative from what I\u2019ve seen right now, especially for her age level.\n\nBut they apparently refer to them as Indians in her class, and I gave her the fun talk of \u201cwell, you don\u2019t want to say Indians because some people will get offended, you want to call them native Americans\u201d. She tried telling me that she has a Native American in her class and he thinks it\u2019s cool to be called an Indian. I let her know that may be the case, but I HIGHLY doubt his parents would be too cool with it. \n\nI learned that lesson the hard way. A dude I worked with was Native American, and I wasn\u2019t aware and said Indian in front of him. I got a good 1 1/2 hour lesson in history from him about how horrible the white man is (and not to say Indian). Then my dumb IGNORANT ass brought up scalping because I legit thought it was something only the native Americans did. \n\nThat extended the lesson for at least another hour.",

We literally colored pictures, a dude went out the window 1 time to leave and she just watched him leave and went about reading her book... I mean I had all my credits done by senior year and totally set my schedule up for the easiest path to graduation possible, even set a record for most P.E. classes possible (they even called me into the office because they fucked up and allowed my schedule to be accepted, theyve since changed a rule to make sure it doesnt happen again) ... But in this class even I was kinda embarrassed. It was like preschool without snacks. Naptime was acceptable though",

Half the time, he was passed out at his desk before class was over and we would wake him up before we left. That class was fantastic. Lift weights if we wanted or just go wander the halls.\n\nFriday night football games with him were a shit show. I'm not quite sure how the head coach or coaching staff.... or any school staff didn't turn him in. All the players and students knew he was wasted.

I have Dyscalculia (aka math dyslexia, I get confused by numbers and operations) and ADHD that I've only gotten proper help for in the past few years as I've grown to stand up for myself more. Teachers always just... Brushed me aside, whether it was a lack of time, will or care, I don't know. The school system kept forcing me through classes even after I failed the prerequisites.\n My high school is much better but of course it still has its issues. \nOne of my teachers wouldnt let me bring my backpack to class even though the school had given it to me to carry around the equipment I get as learning supports through my IEP. Every other class has let me carry it, from art to science lab to gym. \naaaand I didnt understand my work but he refused to help me every time (usually he was just sitting there on youtube or drinking coffee!) and told me to ask my classmates who didnt know enough to be able to teach me.

We noticed that the natives in the mural got more civilized as time went on, in the first set they were making syrup in like loincloths in February, by the end of it they had on full winter gear. Mentioned it to the person running it and their excuse was \"it's old, what can I say\". Just because something was made in the 1970's isn't an excuse for perpetual racism.",

She was the type of teacher who wanted to be liked by the popular kids, so she was extremely inappropriate with boundaries. one day after we finished some sort of acting game she started doing impressions of several kids in our grade who had intellectual disabilities, laughing and mentioning them by name. Thank god those kids weren't present in the classroom, but my friend and I stood there shocked while the other kids laughed and contributed their own impressions. I still regret that we never reported her to the principal. We were two nerdy 13 year old girls and were scared people would ostracize us if we got the \"cool teacher\" in trouble. :/",

Seek to make your life long and its purpose in the service of your people. Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide. Always give a word or a sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger, when in a lonely place. Show respect to all people and grovel to none. When you arise in the morning give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself. Abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision. When it comes your time to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. Sing your death song and die like a hero going home.\n\nThat man was a legend.",

I explained how a bunch of modern day people drove off a broken bridge one morning in the fog because they were just following tail lights in front of them, and they were off the bridge before they could figure why the lights ahead of them suddenly disappeared. (The car in front went in the drink, so the lights disappeared.) This was the Tampa bridge that got hit by a boat, I think a shrimper, thus getting replaced by the current Sky Line Bridge.  He said \"Young lady, do you drive?\"  I said no, to which he replied that I had no idea what I was talking about and should stop talking.\n(He also thought Columbus was a genius because he could balance an egg on its end.)\n\nTold my parents that night and their response was that the next day my dad brought in various native artifacts and tools to \"help him teach\" the genius of the various tribes that were here long before we were.  The teacher left the room since he was so prepared to teach, thus leaving us unattended.  \n\nBad idea.\n\nMy dad taught EVERY student how to use a fire starter properly.  They each had to make three attempts, in different spots on the top of his prized antique wood desk.

You don't handle being corrected very well, and that's ok, but that's still a you problem.\n\nIm glad youre making fun of mental health by using triggered as an insult, it really shows of your scummy character.\n\n\n>I said mental breaks weren't instantaneous,\n\nYes, and I literally never once said otherwise.\n\n>Mate, they aren't mutually exclusive things,\n\nAgain, I literally never claimed otherwise.\n\n\n> What you're witnessing in this video is mental illness.\n\nNeither you nor I are a psychiatrist so thats not really for us to say. What we can say for 100% certainty though is that she is being racist.\n\n\nI cannot comprehend where in this incredibly simple explanation you are getting lost.\n\nAnd again, you clearly have lots of issues of your own that you desperately need to work on.

Never heard of it till now at the age of 40, specifically from your comment. I learned more algebra in college than any of my years from elementary to high school combined. It was a moment of sudden clarity that quite literally felt like someone flipped a switch. It just suddenly made so much sense, all thanks to one professor. I made it a point to tell him how grateful I was on more than one occasion, and he got very long and glowing reviews from me. \n\nI'm from Texas, by the way. Shocked by how bad the math education is? Yeah, me either. But it gets worse. \n\nMy grandmother was a teacher, retired before I was born, and taught me more than I learned in class. I was one of only 3 that could read well out loud in class from middle school through high school. The teachers only picked the 3 of us to recite the books in class everytime after they each realize who were the best readers. I remember especially well when we started Chaucer's Canterbury Tails or any Shakespeare. Every one had to read out loud for it, and to hear them trying so hard and be clearly uncomfortable is deeply heartbreaking. It was crushing to realize how much of the class was barely literate. For Romeo and Juliet, we watched a movie, not a documentary but the one with Paul Rudd and Leonardo DiCaprio: Romeo+Juliet. The teachers and parents absolutely failed those kids. Is it any wonder that things are going the way they are in my state with education like what I'm describing?\n\nI got lucky that my mother was deeply involved in my childhood in positive ways no matter what she was going through as a single mom trying to keep my abusive father away as well while he was in his stalker phase. And my grandmother took great lengths to teach me after school and even before school. I will always be grateful. We just lost my grandmother at the age of 96 right before covid started. I'm glad she didn't have to see the things that happened afterwards.\n\nI somehow wound up on a rant. Sorry about that.",

Opposite is the leg not touching the Angle and is literally opposite. Asjacent is the leg touching the angle, but is not the Hypotinuse. Hypotinuse is the leg of a triangle opposite of the 90 and of a right triangle.\n\nThen getting more advanced is trig identities and their relation to the unit circle and all those relation to periods and some how back to triangles again for physics.

I also didn't really need to have it memorized, since I still looked it up to make sure I was doing it right. Looking it up would have been just as easy regardless of whether I \"learned\" trig years ago. I also had to look up something calculus related for a project once (I was trying to make a 4D software raytracing engine). I have never taken calculus. I was able to just take the equation from an online source and move on with my day.\n\nAs a software engineer, I think schools put way too much focus on math. I have always been above average at math in every math class I have taken, but the simple fact of the matter is that 99% of people don't need anything beyond simple algebra. People who pursue fields which actually require advanced math can take those classes when it becomes relevant to them. The only time I've needed any math beyond basic algebra were the 2 personal projects I mentioned, which both exceed the level of difficulty of anything I've had to do professionally.",

But in effect it also means you've set up a fucked up system like this where students who are being failed by the school system are forced to participate regardless. The solution is schools need to take it really seriously that they need to make it a place that takes into account people from EVERY background. If you're gonna FORCE people to go there, you need to account for everyone too",

The fact that if you don't do what those in power want could lead to poverty was seen as a threat of violence. It's crazy to me how far you conservatives have strayed from that basic understanding.

It's ignorant and it's racism. It doesn't matter what your \"intent\" is, it's still harmful. *Especially* when the culture in question is one that we literally tried to assimilate out of existence. \n\nThere is absolutely no need for it. This is a math class. It's fine to tell a story to help remember an acronym but the native american association is completely unnecessary. It also alienating anyone who may be from that culture in the class. If your teaching method assumes that everyone in your class is white, or at least that there's no one from the culture you're stereotyping, that's a problem.",

I used this example above but it's literally like if the acronym was \"ching chong\" and the teacher pulled her eyes slanted and talked in a bad stereotypical 'Asian' accent, making up a story about a Chinese person. They are mocking what they think the language sounds like, and mocking the culture.\nYou can't just say a nonsense words e, decide it sounds like a certain language, and then make up what you think is a story that sounds like it's from that culture. It's ignorant and it's racism. It doesn't matter what your \"intent\" is, it's still harmful. Especially when the culture in question is one that we literally tried to assimilate out of existence.\nThere is absolutely no need for it. This is a math class. It's fine to tell a story to help remember an acronym but the native american association is completely unnecessary. It also alienating anyone who may be from that culture in the class. If your teaching method assumes that everyone in your class is white, or at least that there's no one from the culture you're stereotyping, that's a problem.",

I have pretty thick skin and am not predisposed to being offended (for example, I never minded the Cleveland Indians' name; I thought the Land O Lakes logo was tasteful and actually a sense of pride, etc.)\n\nThat's not to say I don't find this offensive on some level -- I do -- and that I don't have tremendous empathy for those that are offended on a deeper level. It's not for me to tell others what should offend them.\n\nI'm more outraged that the child that took this video had to endure this. At that age, minds are fragile.

The real \"weirdly lax\" prescription era was in the 90s and 00s, which was the first \"wave\", but current prescribing rates are half of what they were 10 years ago.  Heroin overdoses began to rise starting in the early 2010s, as patients who had become addicted and dependent were cut off by doctors and they began to increasingly turn to the street drug, the second wave.  \n\nShortly thereafter heroin producers and dealers figured that they could make more money by stretching the heroin without reducing the potency if they cut it with illicitly produced fentanyl, and in 2015 fentanyl overdose deaths eclipsed those of prescription drugs and heroin.",

Some dictionaries like Merriam-Webster are notorious lately for letting ideology rather than language inform their definitions.",

I'd tell you to go back to school or read a book so you can know what words mean, but that's probably where you learned incorrect meanings in the first place. The definition you're referring to is using the word in the context of a sentence where you are describing something being overwhelming in a sort of way as violence. Like the Oxford suggestion: \"I was surprised at the violence of my own feelings\". The violence describes the severity of your own feelings in this case, not a violent act someone is committing against you.",

You can't conflate the two definitions, they have have different meanings if you use it as a noun vs. adverb. They are two totally different concepts. For example, you can speak violently, that does not mean your speech is, itself, violence. It is your manner of speaking. That is not equivalent to physical violence, ie. the noun. Or you can violently swing a door shut, but that is not violence. But if you violently swing the door shut in someone's face and it hits them, that's physical violence, the noun. Saying something mean is not violence, you'd literally have to have no more than a grade 6 or 7 education to not understand the difference.",

Throwing in a red herring to muddy the waters is a tacky tactic. Your comment is quite racist as well. That last statement crosses a line.\n\n\n\nAbout Oktoberfest : \n\n> The Oktoberfest (German pronunciation: [\u0254k\u02c8to\u02d0b\u0250\u02ccf\u025bst]) is the world's largest Volksfest (beer festival and travelling funfair). It is held annually in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. It is a 16- to 18-day folk festival running from mid- or late September to the first Sunday in October, with more than six million people from around the world attending the event every year. Locally, it is called d\u2019Wiesn, after the colloquial name for the fairgrounds, Theresienwiese. The Oktoberfest is an important part of Bavarian culture, having been held since the year 1810. Other cities across the world also hold Oktoberfest celebrations that are modeled after the original Munich event.\n\n> During the event, large quantities of Oktoberfest Beer are consumed. During the 16-day festival in 2013, for example, 7.7 million litres (66,000 US bbl; 1,700,000 imp gal) were served.[1] Visitors also enjoy numerous attractions, such as amusement rides, sidestalls, and games. There is also a wide variety of traditional foods available.\n\n> The Munich Oktoberfest originally took place in the 16-day period leading up to the first Sunday in October. In 1994, this longstanding schedule was modified in response to German reunification. As such, if the first Sunday in October falls on the 1st or the 2nd, then the festival would run until 3 October (German Unity Day). Thus, the festival now runs for 17 days when the first Sunday is 2 October and 18 days when it is 1 October. In 2010, the festival lasted until the first Monday in October (4 October), to mark the event's bicentennial.\n\nHistory of Oktoberfest : \n\n> Kronprinz Ludwig (1786\u20131868), later King Ludwig I (reign: 1825\u20131848), married Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen on 12 October 1810. The citizens of Munich were invited to attend the festivities held on the fields in front of the city gates to celebrate the royal event. The fields were named Theresienwiese (\"Theresa's Meadow\") in honour of the Crown Princess, and have kept that name ever since, although the locals have abbreviated the name simply to Wiesn.[2] Horse races, in the tradition of the 15th-century Scharlachrennen (Scarlet Race at Karlstor), were held on 18 October to honor the newlyweds. It is widely believed that Andreas Michael Dall'Armi, a Major in the National Guard, proposed the idea. However, the origins of the horse races, and Oktoberfest itself, may have stemmed from proposals offered by Franz Baumgartner, a coachman and Sergeant in the National Guard. The precise origins of the festival and horse races remain a matter of controversy. However, the decision to repeat the horse races, spectacle, and celebrations in 1811 launched what is now the annual Oktoberfest tradition.\n\n> The fairground, once outside the city, was chosen due to its natural suitability. The Sendlinger Hill (today Theresienhohe) was used as a grandstand for 40,000 race spectators. The festival grounds remained undeveloped, except for the king's tent. The tastings of \"Traiteurs\" and other wine and beer took place above the visitors in the stands on the hill. Before the race started, a performance was held in homage of the bridegroom and of the royal family in the form of a train of 16 pairs of children dressed in Wittelsbach costumes, and costumes from the nine Bavarian townships and other regions. This was followed by the punishing race with 30 horses on an 11,200-foot (3,400 meter)-long racetrack, and concluded with the singing of a student choir. The first horse to cross the finish line belonged to Franz Baumgartner (one of the purported festival initiators). Horse racing champion and Minister of State Maximilian von Montgelas presented Baumgartner with his gold medal.[3]\n\nHow Oktoberfest became an Annual Celebration : \n\n> In 1811, a show was added to promote Bavarian agriculture. In 1813, the festival was canceled due to the involvement of Bavaria in the Napoleonic Wars, after which the Oktoberfest grew from year to year. The horse races were accompanied by tree climbing, bowling alleys, and swings and other attractions. In 1818, carnival booths appeared; the main prizes awarded were of silver, porcelain, and jewelry. The city fathers assumed responsibility for festival management in 1819, and it was decided that Oktoberfest become an annual event. In 1832, the date was moved some weeks later, as a Greek delegation came. It inspired them for the Zappas Olympics which became in 1896 the modern Olympic Games.[citation needed] Later,[when?] the Oktoberfest was lengthened and the date pushed forward because days are longer and warmer at the end of September. The horse race continued until 1960, and the agricultural show still exists today and is held every four years in the southern part of the festival grounds.\n\n> To honour the marriage of Prince Ludwig and Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, a parade took place for the first time in 1810. Since 1850, the parade has become an annual event and an important component of the Oktoberfest. Eight thousand people\u2014mostly from Bavaria\u2014and dressed in traditional costumes walk from Maximilian Street through the centre of Munich to the Oktoberfest grounds. The march is led by the M\u00fcnchner Kindl\n\n> Since 1850, the statue of Bavaria has watched over the Oktoberfest. This worldly Bavarian patron was first sketched by Leo von Klenze in a classic style and Ludwig Michael Schwanthaler romanticised and Germanised the draft.[citation needed] The statue was constructed by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier and Ferdinand von Miller.\n\n> In 1853, the Bavarian Ruhmeshalle was completed. In 1854, the festival was cancelled after 3,000 residents of Munich including the queen consort died during a cholera epidemic. There was no Oktoberfest in 1866 because Bavaria was involved in the Austro-Prussian War. In 1870, the Franco-Prussian War again forced the cancellation of the festival. In 1873, the festival was cancelled due to yet another cholera epidemic. In 1880, electric light illuminated more than 400 booths and tents. In 1881, booths selling Bratwurst opened and the first beer was served in glass mugs in 1892.\n\n> At the end of the 19th century, a re-organization took place. Until then, there were games of skittles, large dance floors, and trees for climbing in the beer booths. Organizers wanted more room for guests and musicians which resulted in the booths becoming beer halls which are still used today.\n\nContinue to learn more here : [Oktoberfest ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest)",

What's currently being taught in US schools is that China is a bad country(well they are if im being honest), but they're including the people from china as well. This creates a domino effect that causes students who just got off from school to see innocent chinese civilians in the US in a negative way. Children who graduated from US schools seems to be more ignorant when compared to other countries such as germany, france, canada, and pretty much those who are catching up to them in terms of wealth and military strength. Even china who's a little poorer than the US in terms of wealth have better education system.\n\nI suggest that they cut off just a minor amount of money, say, if the military's budget is $180B, take something like $5B and use it for training teachers and improving the school quality.\n\nFrom my perspective, the way they're spending large amounts of money, maintaining their defense while pretty much ignoring how fucked up their education system and health care is, is a bad move. I get it that China and probably Russia is a threat to the US but once the feud between the two country is done ,the country'll be left with millions upon millions of ignorant, undisciplined, whiny, people, and I'm sure as hell that that won't be a good thing for the US who was once known as the greatest country.",

Most teachers don\u2019t stay long unless they\u2019re married to a tech worker because they\u2019re not paid enough to live here. Districts are building teacher housing, but even then when teachers no longer qualify to live in them (you get 7 years and then the idea is your pay rate should be good enough to survive in the real world) - people have to leave because they can\u2019t rent more than a studio apartment on their own.\n\nIt\u2019s bad for teachers.

At least that i can see\n\nThe definition you used is a new addition and is not wildly accepted\n\nand frankly i dont give a shit about what the dictionary says because the dictionary does not define the language, the language defines the dictionary. Not the other way round. This is why some words are found in some dictionaries and not others, its the editors choice and is not always an accurate reflection of the language\n\nlanguage is constantly changing and constantly in flux. This recent change in meaning for violent is one that is not widely accepted and in my opinion obfuscates politicised discussion and is born of hyperbole.\n\nIn short i do not recognise the definition you used and i object to it on the basis that it is used to complicate already complicated discussions.\n\nWe shouldnt have to change the English language to make a valid point. \n\nWe shouldnt have to change the English language to end racism\n\nFrom my perspective you are being the dumb one but im not gonna insult you personally because there is no need.\n\nI get what you are trying to do and i get that you are well intentioned, i really do. This sort of behaviour in the original post needs to stop but saying it is violent is just gonna alienate the vast majority of people who dont think it is violent because they do not recognise that definition. They will use that as an excuse to think you are crazy and ignore anything else you say. \n\nIf you have alienated a majority of the population then the conversation is over and no change happens.\n\nThe majority is needed to enact any meaningful change\n\nThats one of the reasons racism still happens - the conversation around it has devolved into a toxic mess of hyperbole and misunderstandings.\n\nI want to solve racism, but changing the language is never gonna help and only ever gonna make it worse.\n\naccuracy with the language is really important, its the starting point of any conversation needed to actually solve the problem.\n\nIt might sound dumb to you but trust me when i say its really important",

That's me by the way. The words \"trailer park\" is literally on my birth certificate, and I am not ashamed of it. I find it... humorous considering the places I have been and the circles I have travelled in. Kinda led a \"Forrest Gump\" type life. \n\nAnd I am telling you this because I want you to understand this when I say it... white people, for the most part, no matter what echelon they are in, whether they are eating lunch with a billionaire, down to the lowliest trailer park and everything in between, tolerate racism in our ranks. It's \"just a joke\" or \"people are too sensitive.\" Bullshit. We know what we are doing and make excuses or outright lie. Plausible deniability as a lifestyle.\n\n\"They would do the same to us if they could.\"  - something I actually heard a town councilman say when I challenged his stupid ass about a policy around a pool. \n\nI have seen a cross burned to run out a family and I watched the cops drag my neighbors, a Black family out on their lawn at 3am over a neighbor claiming they stole his shovel. And I have had my own mother tell me her version of the \"replacement theory.\" Oh, btw, if you ask, she \"doesn't have a racist bone in her body.\" \n\nSo what part is predicated on my whiteness?\n\nAll of it.\n\nI'm sick of the excuses and the lies.\n\nThis woman did this because she could. Because she has always gotten away with it before. \n\nBut don't worry about her, when she is hopefully shit canned, she will make a GoFundMe and folks who don't really have it to spare will donate to her.",

As a teacher, if one of your co-working teachers pulled this stunt, why wouldn't any other teacher at least either talk to her or turn her in?  This is absolutely not ok and to hear that she had done this before is quite crazy.",

I'm not making any kind of value judgment about it; it's just a fact.\n\n> Being an american website its not an excuse, the internet is global not national, everyone can upload anything.\n\nAgain, you are totally wrong. Even on a fundamental level, the Internet isn't really global. China effectively has its own Internet. On top of that, just because people can do something doesn't mean they will. Many websites, including Reddit, are mostly American content - about half of Reddit's users are American.\n\n> So thats no excuse either.\n\nI suppose it isn't really an \"excuse\" so much as a perfectly valid justification that I used to think was painfully obvious.",

But there is a difference between some people acting a fool and others who are genuinely having some kind of mental issue.  My mother has bi polar.  She has said and done some awful things during manic episodes.  It unfortunately goes with the territory.  The thing about mania is when people are in those episodes they always go for the jugular.  Whatever will be most hurtful.  If you are their child it's probably going to be the thing you are most sensitive about.  I know that from experience.  I have also heard my mother say racist things (thankfully never in public and never to someone).  I am not going to say she is not a racist or that she doesn't have some deep seated racism but I have never heard her say something racist when she is \"level\". In fact when she level is generally kind hearted, warm and I can't imagine that person ever saying a bad word to anyone. \n\nI am not excusing some of what she has said.  I struggle to forgive her for some of things she has said to me.  But I am grateful no one has ever pointed a camera in her face and posted the video online during some of her manic episodes.  Usually after mania comes depression and I just don't know how she would cope if that happened to her.  She also doesn't deserve the vitriol and judgement of the internet for deeply personal and mental health issues she deals with on a daily basis. \n\nMillennials and gen z are great at owning their own mental health issues, even wear it as a badge of honour but they fail to recognise it in older generations where it was taboo to ever talk about these things and never truly been able to deal with them.  They are very quick to judge and hold a trail by media without ever looking at or questioning the context or what is going on behind the outburst.  We (millennial and get z) are not as empathic or understanding as we like to pretend.",

Also let\u2019s be honest recording some of the shit minorities go through with white people is the only way other white people will believe it- and even then they will come up with excuses for their vitriol and an explanation. There\u2019s always an explanation, there\u2019s always a mental health issue, there\u2019s always kindness. While others receive nothing and are expected to just deal.

Including the video played so the principal / super can watch it in all its glory.\n\nThere\u2019s no excuse for whatever \u201cthis\u201d is. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely a different thing to post it to social media (who are powerless to do anything except for well, cancel I guess?) so that the entire world can get their 2 minute glimpse into someone acting ridiculous and rip her to shreds. \n\n\nThis teacher has made a mistake that will obviously effect her career and as it should, in whatever form that may be.\n\nBut forever when you type her name in, you will see even decades later this video. Is this teacher mentally unwell? Is she an unrepentant racist? Who knows, but on the Internet that doesn\u2019t matter. Even if this woman goes to get a job bagging groceries, employers will see this video of her on her worst day and act accordingly.\n\nThis will follow her for her entire life, and has likely ruined it. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not condoning what she did in any form or function here. She clearly needs to go into racial sensitivity training and perhaps get a deep dive into what she did is not okay whatsoever.\n\nBut posting things like this to social media needs to be treated by society as something of more a serious event IMO. Everyone has a camera, I get that, and they\u2019re never going away.\n\nBut posting everything we see just for\u2026 Internet likes i guess? Carries a lot of unintended results for the victims that are very likely forever life altering.\n\nAgain, I support recording this in general. I support using it as a way to get disciplinary action against a teacher that you find is acting in a racially insensitive / racist manner that is clearly offensive towards a particular culture (in this case, native Americans).\n\nBut I do think that for generation Z and late millennials we do need to question why something like this needs to be posted on Reddit of all places. The consequences for posts like this are forever life altering, and usually for the negative.\n\nFor all we know, outside of doing dumb things like this she\u2019s an excellent teacher and the students love her. But we will never know that now, she\u2019s forever branded a racist and judging from a lot of these posts, should never work in any capacity ever again. Social\nMedia is an extremely Cruel place. \n\nAnd again, what she did is 100% in the wrong and deserved punishment no doubt. But global condemnation is a very very heavy sword to wield. I kind of question why for the younger generation \u201cto the Internet!\u201d Is the first thing on anyone\u2019s mind when they see someone acting out.\n\nThis was a stupid culturally ignorant display that she pulled no doubt, but her punishment (before the school board can even do anything) is complete scorched earth. Her life for the most part is destroyed and can never return to how it was before this video was posted. \n\nAn interesting observation of society at large I suppose being played out here in the comments. \n\nUnfortunately the lesson likely to be learned here is that people are always recording, so act like everyone\u2019s got a camera and watch at all times.",

I  think it's justified when its someone in power (such as politicians or cops or even teachers) or when someone who puts themselves in the spotlight but when  its just some random woman on the street who is clearly not in their right mind I can only see my mother.   I'd like to point out as well I never specified only white women.  I was referring to women and more specifically older women.  I've seen POC posted over the internet for acting \"crazy\". Often for black women its perpetuating the angry black woman stereotype when in reality it's just a person who probably needs help or is suffering from mental issues.  I don't see anyone making excuses for either case honestly.  It's only if they are wealthy (and less face it, conventionally pretty) that they get a free pass or people make excuses for them.\n\nI am just saying any of these viral videos could have been my mother and she wouldn't deserve it.  I am sure there are many who have fallen victim to that who didn't deserve it either.  I just wish everybody could be a little more understanding and compassionate to each other.  I know that is idealistic and perhaps  unrealistic but I just feel this is a thing we will look back on as being a negative reflection on society, much like we look back on the love of tabloids in the early 2000s.  Every generation seems to come up with a new way vilifying women and placing them on public trial.  Currently it's trail by social media.  Before it was trial by media.  Before that  it was literal witch hunts.   I hope we can move past this some day.  As you said, all women can fall victim to it and it's  even worse for POC.  Surely that's even more of a reason to  call it out when you see it.",

I was a teacher for a few years right after college and while there are some very smart and capable ones who are there because they love teaching, there are more than a few absolute nut jobs. The bar for getting a teaching license has been lowered (at least in my state where they have trouble finding teachers) so if you have a degree -in any subject- you can take a few extra courses and a couple of tests and become a teacher. The base pay is something like $32,000, the work is much harder and time consuming than most people realize, and you get the same respect as an Amazon warehouse worker. The only bonus is that the state employee insurance is decent and you might get 4-6 weeks off between school years. (I say \u201cmight\u201d because they required me to spend a lot of summer break in continuing ed or other training, and I also had to cram in a graduate class almost every summer to keep my license current- tuition paid out of my pocket of course.) The vast majority of new teachers in my state exit the profession within the first five years. Of the ones who stay, some truly have a calling to teach, and some don\u2019t have better options. This is what you end up with, and it\u2019s not even one of the best examples of lunacy in the classroom.",

What is amazing is that it\u2019s believed this mythical tribe was actually discovered, their mummified remains and countless artifacts, in a mining cave. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting as while they were claimed to be giants, I\u2019ve always wondered if they were descendants of Vikings (as it is now widely accepted that Vikings landed here long before colonialism started), perhaps stranded here and turning to cannibalism of other people/tribes to survive if they were unequipped to farm their own food or survive without knowledge of these lands etc. I don\u2019t know it was always a theory. \n\nThis teacher is a moronic meltdown in the making and nothing about her behavior or her attitude is okay or acceptable. She completely proved that no matter how far we come, no matter how much we learn and grow, stupidity will always exist because ignorance will always exist.\n\nEdit: honestly I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what she was attempting to teach aka disrespect and mock (her apparent version of teaching). But I saw cah on the white board and it sure sounds like she\u2019s ranting si-te-cah at one point. So I could be totally off.

King James had the Clan Chiefs killed, and the women and children sent to work hard labor on plantations in Ireland. After 3 generations working on the Plantations they were given 2 options. Stay and continue working here or help England build there new colony in America in exchange for freedom.\n\nThey chose the second option not knowing anything about the native people. 500 years ago they built the towns and cities that would become new york and Philadelphia. Working with some tribes that were friendly and fighting other tribes that were hostile.\n\nI feel horrible about the plight of native americans in this country. But Im also reminded by many that this is not my home, and when I trace my roots back i find 2000 years of a people moving from place to place never being allowed to stay one place, always being told this isn't their home.\n\nI am the last of an indo European tribe that was pushed off their land half a millennia ago and I either have no culture, or I have the shared culture of 500 years in the americas and 1500 years roaming northern europe. We can be one people or no people.",

This here is a failed attempt at creating engagement in a lesson overdramatising an abbreviation in a racist way (unintentional or not, still not good).\n\nI appreciate all teachers, bad and good, especially during COVID but this is just fucked.\n\nEdit: I realise now that saying \u201cweird ass outfit\u201d may sound rude but that\u2019s what we all thought when we were teenagers so I\u2019m keeping it for authenticity :)",

Are you telling me that you want a teacher, a representative of the school she works for, to go unpunished for racist manner towards Native Americans? Like, there is no question: this was racist, you don't even try and deny that. There are subtleler forms of racism that I think that, if you truly didn't know, then an apology coupled with a true effort to correct the behavior, then sure, let them back on a short leash. But there comes a point where it is either reckless ignorance or active malice.

It very well could be, I just didn't want to say that it was when it in fact wasn't.\n2) Even if she has Native American heritage, she is still using a stereotyped caricature to mock a vast array of cultures. I would assume that the first lesson in any Native American dance class is avoiding stereotyped costumes and potential pit falls. Regardless of her amateurish experience in this hypothetical scenario, there were some key steps that were skipped. The faux-prayer at the end was the icing on the cake. \n3) White face is a little different. Blackface came from around the time that slaves were being set free and many white people hated it. So they started putting on performances aimed in showing how poor and uneducated they were, all the while showing how they were too stupid to even understand that they weren't supposed to be happy. Which is obviously 15 levels of fucked up: the only reason they were poor and uneducated at the time is because they were beaten, punished, and killed for trying to change that.

I don't know how accurate the quote is in OP's title, but if I'm assuming the kid recording actually said it, then I can also assume he's just trying to convey the same point I'm making, but he's just young and doesn't really know how to express that idea accurately. Teenagers are drama queens, and tend to use exaggerated language to describe negative feelings and experiences. I just think that's the case here, rather than him seeing this as literal violence.",

Saying you feel violence was committed against you when no physical harm takes place is not the same thing. \n\nYes, violence can be an emotional descriptor when you have outwardly violent feelings or are in danger of bodily harm, not when you\u2019re teacher is making a fool of themselves. Nothing that teacher did was violent and as far as we know, the demonstration was not directed at the student recording.\n\nUpset? Attached? What are you even on about?

However, the part that is ridiculous is the way that she is making a mockery of an entire cultural belief system. I'm not a snowflake liberal, nor am I a cultic conservative, but what the fuck lady... How tone deaf and culturally insensitive can you be in such a short amount of time...\n\nI don't typically like cancel culture, but this is something worth her losing her job over. You can't expect to keep a job teaching students while being bigoted and racist with such a tone deaf display. \n\nFor all the people who are going to argue about this or down vote it, how would you feel if your entire cultural upbringing and/or religious ideology was made a mockery by somebody \"teaching\" a lesson plan in school.",

Yeah, most people would stop.\n\n\nedit: to be clear, I am saying that being an asshat is not violent. It's just a bad thing to do.",

I find it such an odd take when you look back at human history and its \"The so and so war, the so and so conquest, etc\" then its \"stolen land\" for the US.\n\nFurthermore, native americans were also guilty of war and slavery. Pretending they are some how special victims instead of just another culture that fell to another is asinine. Were atrocities committed? Sure, and its terrible. Should we work to prevent them as humanity progresses? You bet! But I'd be willing to wager that if someone dressed as some long forgotten european tribal-warrior and ran about, you wouldn't be concerned over racism even though their land was \"stolen\" and their culture basically erased, be it by romans or whoever.\n\n>it\u2019s not the same. it won\u2019t ever be. i\u2019m white, i\u2019ll be the first to admit that yeah, it IS more insensitive because she is white.\n\nSo all white people had a hand in what happened in the US? If this chick had a Russian accent would it still be as bad? I think you may be a racist if you think all white people are somehow responsible for everything any white person has ever done.\n\nNow, I'd agree she shouldn't dress up like that and act like an idiot, simply for the fact that I don't see any educational purpose to it at all. That doesn't necessarily make it racist, she may just be dense.",

You'll also need an airlock system for transferring ghosts into the unit. You're then going to need a proton pack, which is simply a Neutrona Wand or any off brand particle thrower connected to a back pack sized particle accelerator. In addition to this pack you need an echo trap capable of storing the pke (psycho-kenetic energy) of a ghost - I suggest the Echo 1-B Super Slammer Muon Trap, it's relatively affordable and just as good as any other Muon Trap.   \n\nYou're going to need to fire a stream of highly focused and radially polarized protons to electrostatically capture the negative charged energy of a ghost and *hold* it in said stream then transfer to your Muon Trap to be emptied in the containment unit via airlock.  \n\nSo ghosts go in containment units, not closets.  \n\nSkeletons are a much better thing to hide in your closet.",

I know the conquistadors introduced small pox to the native Americans but they didn't try utilizing it as a weapon to kill off all of them. You don't realize that germ theory wasn't even established until the 1800s so these people had little to no idea what diseases came from let alone how to spread them. \n\nIf you do an ounce of research you'll find there is no indication that the conquistadors fully utilized germ warfare en masses to kill off the natives. There is the blankets story which already is a hotly debated story but even assuming it was true (which I personally believe it is true) doesn't explain the literal 10s of millions of natives that died from the spread of disease.\n\nOnce again it was all incidental. \n\nAlso next time read your own sources before you tell people to read them thinking they are proving whatever point you're trying to make.",

Because The Europeans used it as a biological weapon as a biological weapon it's spread faster and  Was systematically direct is systematically directed at the Native American populations. If a tribe across the river died out from smallpox but was never given a blanket that contaminated with smallpox but instead took in the survivors and the sick from the initial recipients of the smallpox blankets means the Europeans using biological warfare killed those people off. Even if it was indirectly the European still cause that. How fucking stupid are you?",

Because The Europeans used it as a biological weapon as a biological weapon it's spread faster and  Was systematically direct is systematically directed at the Native American populations. If a tribe across the river died out from smallpox but was never given a blanket that contaminated with smallpox but instead took in the survivors and the sick from the initial recipients of the smallpox blankets means the Europeans using biological warfare killed those people off. Even if it was indirectly the European still cause that. How fucking stupid are you?",

But what I was really arguing before was that the colonists weren't intensively using biological warfare as a means to reduce the native population. \n\nAlso although that did exacerbate the rate of death for natives that did have contact with settlers it doesn't explain the mass dying of native populations who didnt even come into contact with settlers. And although the issues with resources, the slave trade, and territory disputes sped up the process where the Europeans settled all it did was speed up the inevitable. \n\nIf you look into the accounts with the conquistadors there were already huge swaths of Native Americans dying before they even developed a large enough infrastructure to do any of those things. And they weren't just dying off slowly it was VERY rapid. Entire cities would get cut in half before the conquistadors would even arrive with bodies piled up everywhere. The extent to how deadly the combination of all these disease were are insane. \n\n90% of Native Americans died between 1492 and 1600 including many that lived in the area that was soon to become the US even though hardly any Americans lived there yet.\n\nThere is more to say but I have to get going.

It's really simple, before you commit to any decision ask yourself who is my audience? \"What is my intent?\" how might my actions be interpreted by others, and most importantly what message I am conveying at large, the implications of my actions.  Cause sometimes as people we are blind to the abuse we subject others to, we rationalize it,  we expect others to think exactly like ourselves, I get it, I grew up in that environment. It comes down to this though, you as an individual don't really get to decide for someone else what they can or cannot be offended by, it's like the bully who has no clue why his victims hate him..  and then you imply that we should use behavior conditioning to \"teach\" people what they should or shouldn't find offensive.. like fuck me dude.",

I it's similar to crying wolf pointing out things like this as racism. It takes away from the real issue of racism. It devalues the actual cause of ending racism to claim everything is racism.

Just saw a video where black students tols these two white guys that white culture isnt a thing so whites shouldn't be included in a multicultural building on a college campus that they needed to leave. I just find it funny the ones who fought against segregation for years \"and rightfully so\" are demanding segregation now. I always stand up against racism but I'm just tired of the bullsh*t. People want to pick and choose what's racist when it's convenient. A lady dancing around with feathers on her head is racist now? Do you live in America? Sign your property over to Indians then.. or make sure to have your parents and or family do it. I agree what happened to them is disgusting and we should be fighting real racism not igniting uneccesary fires while avoided the actual fire burning that is truly the fire that matters.",

I can't imagine how uncomfortable, humiliated, misunderstood, and isolated this must have made the student feel.\n\nThere are plenty of great ways a teacher to make the minority students feel included and seen, and plenty of good ways to help our classmates understand all the differences and how that's great and should be embraced.\n\nThis lady....she just crossed the International Date Line in the opposite direction holy fuck.\n\nOne silver lining: it is SO much easier to just hide your face, try to ignore it, and hope at the very least your friends know better. This kid instead decided to speak up, KNEW how many problems it would cause, and still went through with it. That took some serious courage, and it's wonderful that so many people see and agree.\n\nThis is so so muc",

I'm glad there's some that can do it, cus I couldn't.\n\nThe blatant challenges and disrespect from students, the heartbreak you feel when you know a kid is being abused or bullied and you can't get anything to change, the pressure from higher ups (that never spent more than a few minutes in a classroom) to implement some weird new edu strategy that doesn't work at all, being incapable of paying your bills, and parents and society blaming you first for everything going wrong in the country. \n\nI'm too selfish to carry that burden to teach your dipshit kid that'll probably never amount to more than stocking shelves at Walmart.

I have heard a lot of insane things come out of the mouths of people from all generations.  This is some asinine thinking.  Just because you are being subjected to some racist shit by a moron in a very inappropriate setting there is no violence being committed.  Just because your pride and feelings are being [figuratively] trampled upon and you are justifiably upset, this is not anywhere akin to violence.  Of course this may be something lost in translation with the language of the student should they be fluent in their mother tongue.  \n\nDo not get me wrong.  This teacher is doing something insensitive at best and absolutely tone deaf.  There should be some pretty tough action taken against the idiot teaching the class.  Can someone please elucidate upon how this act is considered to be violent?Calling this violence is how we get another 4 years of Trump or one of his lackeys in office as president instead of whichever lackluster, unappealing, flawed and mired in scandal candidate the opposition puts forward.  This idea has all the hallmarks of someone who has never been on the receiving ends of a few punches to the jaw.  Great job of creating another talking point and clap trap to some talking heads in the conservative culture war.",

Why do you think there is a teacher shortage?\nMy reasons are:\nA) The amount of education a teacher has to receive is not worth the pay they may receive.\nB) Students treating them poorly is not a great incentive. In middle school I witnessed my science teacher break down into sobbing tears after the class laughed at her for tap-dancing. All she was doing was trying to get the class to show each other a special talent we had as an ice breaker.\nC) My high school debate teacher had a masters from Brown University he was very qualified the same for my science teacher also had a master\u2019s while he was working on a doctorate in biology. My high school also had its fare share of bad teachees",

I'm sure it was just supposed to be fun, but looking back on it now, massive cringe. During an assembly when the parents could come it. We sang a song called, \"dance, dance Indian man\" or something like that.  I do think there was any I'll intensions though.\n\nThe only one, was egged on by our class in highschool. I guess we were talking about WW2 or something. Some how our class was introduced to the word, Jap Slap, which means:\n\nJap Slap\nWhen a person is slapped twice across the face, and the repercussions are equivalent to that of two atomic bombs- Hiroshima and Nagasaki style!\n\nSo nothing too bad from the teachers.",

      "text": "Hmm, I guess I\u2019ll say it. I\u2019m going to start this with saying that what this teacher did was stupid, racially insensitive / racist and what the student did by recording such a random outburst was 100% in the right since he/she was clearly witnessing something that offended them in the classroom. \n\nShe 100% should be disciplined and properly dealt with by whatever the principal / school admin deems fit (and if that\u2019s termination, so be it).\n\n\n\n\nSo I guess my question is why was this posted to social media instead of being given to school admin? They can never deal with this accordingly now. Or was that the intention?\n\n\n\nThis teacher is 100% in the wrong, but this will forever follow her for life. She will forever be seen as the racist riverside teacher. Anytime someone puts her name on the Internet, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll see. She\u2019s essentially going to become (or likely already has) a pariah. The school will have to fire her, her life is destroyed. Any disciplinary procedure or learning experiences to learn from this are now completely out the window. She can\u2019t go back to the life she had before the video was posted. \n\nAnd honestly for some of the stuff that gets posted online it may be deserved. But I\u2019m not so sure this is one of those things.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know is well, is she actually a good teacher? Do the students like her outside of this one instance? Is she racist? Is she not? Does she hate native Americans? Does she respect them? Is she manic? Bipolar? On drugs of any sort? Actively writing racist skits in her spare time? Or was she just ignorant? \n\nSo many questions and yet, None of that matters anymore. And judging from a lot of the comments here, she should forever be forced as a jobless pariah pushed to the extreme outsides of society.\n\nBut like, does the punishment fit the crime?\n\nAgain, not condoning the behaviour in any sort. And if the school board decided she shouldn\u2019t be employed during the course of their investigation, so be it. It would be justified (IMO).\n\nBut social media is a heavy, heavy sword that I think the younger generations don\u2019t quite understand right now. If you posted this video hoping to see change in the world towards racial insensitivity / cultural appropriation, unfortunately that\u2019s likely not going to happen.\n\nThe second something like this hits social media and goes viral, the only response is basically termination and public ridicule. This teachers reputation is fatally destroyed forever, and that is forever tied to her with a quick google search of her name, even decades after the fact. She can\u2019t go back to that classroom after this for sure, and if she did she would likely come back in a completely different form and be extremely paranoid. \n\nAgain, she likely is going to have been terminated anyways, but the \u201cto the internet!!!\u201d Trend among younger people needs to be (IMO anyways) examined a bit. Not saying outright stopped, but examined a bit. \n\nEveryone has a camera, and anyone can record anybody on their worst day. But the reality of that is, being recorded when you\u2019re at your low now has the power to forever effect your life going forward. This has never been the case in history ever before.\n\n\nAgain, recording this is 100% the right call. Putting it on social media??? Ehhh I don\u2019t think I agree with that given the context. Putting things like this on social media basically means you are throwing them to the fire. If that\u2019s your intention, sure, go for it. But remember that when you put people to the fire, they\u2019re going to burn. \n\nHer social life is forever destroyed over this incident. Warranted or not, this is the only outcome of posting videos to Reddit / Twitter / Facebook / Instagram.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is, that posting things to social media is 2021 a bigger decision with enormous consequences than I think people (especially young people) quite fully understand right now. The results are extremely harsh. If you\u2019re looking for that, then by all means post it. Because it\u2019s the only thing you\u2019re going to get (saw a post talking about how they\u2019ve already doxxed the teacher for instance, which is crazy to me). Not everything needs to be put out for global consumption.\n\nThis video IN MY OPINION should have been handed over to admin and the teacher should have been dealt with internally (and likely terminated). But I don\u2019t necessarily agree that intense Internet mockery and scorn for the rest of their life is an appropriate punishment. That is an extreme punishment that carries significant social weight for the rest of her life. \n\n\nThis was an opportunity to have a serious discussion and have a learning experience for the teacher, but instead that conversation will likely never happen now. And who knows, she probably would have been terminated anyways, since this is an incredible display of ignorance for a math class of all things.\n\nUnfortunately, If you were a racist / insensitive teacher operating in America right now, the first thing you do after seeing this go viral and this teacher being forever doxxed is to ban phones in the classroom. That\u2019s the harsh reality of life and the actual lesson being taught, even though many of us would never agree with that.",
