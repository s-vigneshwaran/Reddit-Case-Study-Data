It\u2019s true we\u2019re not in a vacuum, and I think that the \u201cwe don\u2019t negotiate with terrorists\u201d attitude towards the opposition neglects the urgency of the current state of reality for too many people.  At the moment, the \u201cterrorists\u201d are here and the power dynamic is in their favor, so how do we make the best of that? \n\nI still can\u2019t quite see why you think a gridlock is the lesser evil here, but if you\u2019re willing to elaborate what you hope to play out, I\u2019m open to hearing it.",

That bill never passed.  I'm not sure how you're gathering it means hospitals could refuse to treat trans people for any reason.  That is illegal.  \n\nAdoption laws are set by states.\n\nGay marriage is legal. At the time Republicans were opposing it, so were a lot of Democrats including Obama.  It was definitely a bipartisan issue opposing it.  Your beef should be with politicians and the Federal government in general.  They hold too much power and control over everyone's lives.",

Fuck whoever you want.\n\nI do have issue with making up genders because in the past our forms that list \u201cgender\u201d have always referred to sex. So in reality idc if you make up gender as long as you can recognize the differences between sex and gender. If we can agree that we call all males he and him regardless of whether they\u2019re masculine, feminine or neither. Then we\u2019re in agreement.\n\nIt goes without saying that forms that list gender would be changed to list sex instead. Heck you can even have a masculine male, feminine male, masculine female, and feminine female as all genders (they encompass every sub gender). Agender would be missing the function of of masculine or feminine and thus isn\u2019t a gender, but they still have a sex. So to include them into pronouns we\u2019d switch those to based on sex as well.",

Someone can be more masculine or feminine than another person. You can also be fluid with your masculinity or femininity. There also exists people that don\u2019t like being masculine or feminine.\n\nMale and Female is the binary. You\u2019re either male or female. Someone isn\u2019t less male than another person even if they\u2019re less masculine.\n\nThe left and the right have a really hard time with differentiating male and female. The left believes that the definition of role I provided is the entire definition gender, but they\u2019re missing the other half. The right believes that the definition of gender is no different from sex, but they\u2019re missing the other half.\n\nGender is a measure of how sexes act in a society. It\u2019s not some personal preference of identity it\u2019s how you act. This definition means that we can measure how many males are feminine and how many are masculine. feminine and masculine only really meaning how the sexes act.\n\nGender used to just mean masculine or feminine, and sex used to not have any part in it other than that masculine traditionally would be how to describe how a male should act. With recent changes in people\u2019s beliefs it\u2019s important to be much more precise than we have been.\n\nThe right disagrees with me because I want there to be 4 genders.\n\nThe left disagrees with me because I don\u2019t think role is all that important when calling someone by a pronoun because it may change.\n\nI thought of this definition with input from both sides. It\u2019s carefully put together only with facts. I can assure you no one is left out with this definition.\n\nAgender fit in by not being masculine or feminine thus not filling both requirements to have a gender. They just have a sex. So role based pronouns wouldn\u2019t apply to them, even gender neutral pronouns would be wrong as they imply having a gender.\n\nGender fluid are accounted for as they can be masculine or feminine without fear of being bullied for \u201conly changing their pronouns for attention seeking\u201d\n\nTransgender are accounted for as they don\u2019t need to modify their bodies to be transgender. So those without hormones or bottom surgery are no less trans than those with those things. They can just be as feminine or masculine as they are comfortable with doing.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t make me an ally to the Alphabet mafia then I guess I\u2019m not.",

In Minnesota we have the DFL, Democratic Farmer and Laborer party. They've been instrumental in pushing for things like mandated sick pay in Minneapolis and our $10 minimum wage, which frankly with cost of living beats out both California and NYC with their $15. A labor party also keeps the state blue even as more and more of the rural areas fall for the Trump grift. Still plenty of Democrat holdouts out in Trump country, but that won't last.",

Running as a Republican does not mean the person is a conservative. \n\nLook at Bloomberg in his mayoral race. Giuliani had done a great job turning New York around and handling the 911 attack. Bloomberg knew the city wanted to keep a conservative Mayor so he ran as a Republican even though he has been a Democrat all his life. And not just a middle of the road Democrat he is openly supports the Progressive ideology. And yet when Bloomberg ran for President, he ran as a Democrat. \n\nIf you look to Former President Trump as an example of a middle of the road conservative you will never have an accurate picture. He\u2019s not a conservative.",

Humans are fallible/imperfect, but there are still plenty of good/better places to get your news diet... Not to mention multiple sources, even including shit stains like Fox and CNN.\n\nThe 24-hour cycles are the worst of the media, IMO, and that's typically what people compare due to viewer absorption and emotional/entertainment appeal. So let's take a look: Fox averages 1.3 million viewers a day, while MSNBC had 919,000 and CNN only had 787,000. [2021 Source.](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/585987-fox-news-tops-yearly-ratings-rankings). I've personally known DOZENS of people who keep Fox News on in their household for 2-3 hours per day. I've only met 1 person for each of the other two networks. Tucker Carlson constantly rakes in the most, and [he spews white nationalist talking points.](https://www.insider.com/tucker-carlson-replacement-theory-david-duke-kkk-trump-2021-10)\n\nYes, he constantly regurgitates white supremacy points. \n\n* [First source.](https://youtu.be/JEIeT0OtBM0) \n* [Jon Oliver was able to do a whole fucking 25 minute comparison.](https://youtu.be/XMGxxRRtmHc)\n* [the ADL called for him to be fired, and he doubled down](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/04/12/fox-backs-tucker-carlson-and-rejects-adl-call-his-firing/7197805002/)\n* [fourth source](https://youtu.be/SkQKVMYyPoM)\n* [his old co-worker confirmed it.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/08/08/tucker-carlson-colleague-shepard-smith-white-nationalism-real/1952866001/)\n* [even conservative-leaning the hill confirms it.](https://thehill.com/homenews/media/456498-tucker-carlson-white-supremacy-is-a-hoax-not-a-real-problem)\n\nDo I need to go on?  While there's a very real bias problem, and scandals/corruptions that appear on other MSMs, you can't fucking compare them to Fox.\n\nNo one here is condoning when CNN does something awful (the Cuomo's say hello, many people who ingest CNN were angry about them), but don't be delusional to just how bad conservative-MSM has become, especially since you already acknowledged OAN's garbage.\n\nSo once again; there is no such thing as perfect journalism. All humans are fallible. That's why it's important to cross reference and remain skeptical. However, knowing where the worst of the worst stand, relatively, is extremely important.",

In December, [UK courts ruled that Assange could be extradited to the US](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/10/world/europe/uk-julian-assange-extradition.html). The initial ruling that blocked extradition because it would be \"bad for his health\" argued that prison conditions in the US would be bad for his *mental health*.\n\nWhy did you ignore my second paragraph? Ignoring any involvement Biden may or may not have in this, extraditing Assange to assassinate him makes absolutely zero sense. The US wants to extradite Assange from the UK to charge him with violating the espionage act. Assassinating him while in US custody would just further reinforce the idea that the US government is the evil entity that it's made out to be in WikiLeaks. It would absolutely decimate global opinion of the country, which already isn't too great to say the least. It would also make any proposed extraditions in the future much more difficult. \n\nWhat benefit would the US gain from assassinating Assange? WikiLeaks has already aired the United States' dirty laundry, killing Assange doesn't undo that. There is nothing to gain from assassinating him, there is only downside.",

Not convincing at all.\n\nAlso, why is it \"CNN lies\" when CBS reported it first?\n\nCNN breaking news tweeted \"The White House wanted to have 10,000 active duty troops on the streets of Washington and other cities earlier this week to quell protesters, but defense officials pushed back on the idea, a source says\" with a link to an article.\n\nThe CNN article says \"a senior defense official\" told CBS first, and a second source confirmed it with more details. \n\nCNN also says Bill Barr and the White House denied it. (Added later, with quotes from Bill Barr and Alyssa Farah. The original article was posted before the denials.)\n\nCNN says they have two witness accounts. Barr and Farah say they're wrong. *Someone* is lying. Reporters from both CNN and CBS? The 2 \"defense officials\"? Bill Barr and Alyssa Farah? All we can do is speculate.\n\nThere are 3 options:\n\nCBS made it up, they had no source. However, CBS and CNN added the denials from the White House. If the original article was just a lie, why would they bother?\n\nWe don't know who the \"defense officials\" are, but maybe they made it up. CBS wouldn't be lying, they were lied to.\n\nMaybe the White House and Bill Barr are lying to protect their boss. This seems the most believable to me. People have lied to protect the President plenty of times in the past (from both parties).",

And that\u2019s exactly what I plan to do. I don\u2019t plan to give up. I know that I wouldn\u2019t be here but for those that fought before me, so I\u2019m going to continue this fight. We can\u2019t let up. If we say we\u2019ve been defeated, then they have won. This is a war. This isn\u2019t a battle, and we absolutely will win this war.\n>CROSS: It is a war, it is indeed a war. And I have to say, they have won some battles, Jasmine, but we have to keep our eye on the war. And everybody needs to pick up a weapon and get involved because this is for the safety and lasting of the country.\n\nWhatever your thoughts on black women discussing voting rights, this is not calling for violence. Have you ever heard something like \"lost the battle, but won the war\"? This is obviously extending that metaphor. Tiffany Cross is clearly not \"Advocat(ing) Armed Violence,\" unlike what the title claims.\n\nlidblog.com is lying here",

That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to the reporters.\"\n\nHe admits that he was talking about disinfectant, not light.  And no, he wasn't being sarcastic.  He was being deadpan serious.  If you watched more than 5 minutes of Trump speaking, you would know when he's being sarcastic and when he's being serious.

Republicans are held bent on taking the nation in their direction with no ifs ands or buts. And when those party lines put others at risk of not being equal or keeping them from equality and even worse putting them in jail or having it easier for them to be killed. I believe trying for bipartisanship is flat out wrong. \nDemocrats need to learn to fight and fight hard.  \nWe the ppl also need to learn how to vote in every election, be aware of what is really going on. \n\nAnd I'm proud that Joe Biden said what he did about a certain reporter. \nJournalism is supposed to be about the truth, not a they said, but they said.\nDemocracy dies in the light when journalism doesn't do their job.",

You state it's not attack on the press, but Trump even started attacking Fox news when Fox got tired of Trumps shit. He was trying to manipulate his base. To make them believe what he wanted them to believe. He weaponized the followers against any news agency that didn't bend to his will. This is literally how Trump does everything.

Hell, it made his secretary of defense resign. \n\nTwo- Not to be a dick, but sacrificing lives to save lives of our Allies is absolutely a better move than just dipping out without giving a heads up. Here\u2019s the best part- Literally he just had to warn them. \u201cHey guys, we\u2019re leaving. We checked the ovens turned off, and refilled the brita. Good luck!\u201d Hell, US troops weren\u2019t even aware of the plans until they were waking up. \n\nThree- Linked to the above, US soldiers dying for a foreign land is not my idea of a good use of their lives, but they volunteered, and died in service of protecting civilians and allied soldiers. In Syria, we left our Allies high and dry- But moved troops to Saudi Arabi- The actual planners of 9/11 by the way.\n\nFour- Both are shit. We shouldn\u2019t have been in either country, but we were. Both presidents fucked up. \n\nAlso- Stop dodging the argument and shifting the goalposts. I\u2019m really not sure what point you\u2019re trying to prove- I\u2019ve already said I don\u2019t like Biden. \n\nOh! And! Yes, I watch both conservative and \u201cliberal(bullshit)\u201d news.
