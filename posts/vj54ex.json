When I was 14, a bra salesperson at a large chain told me I had a 32 band and should get a 32B. When my boobs were popping out, she gave me a 34 B. Because the band was so massive, my boobs weren't half out of the bra, but the band rode up my back. Salesperson said that was my size. Believed it for years, and never understood how most women could be wearing the wrong size. Got properly sized at a boutique and found out I was a 30F. Changed my life.\n\nEveryone should know they have *one* bra size at any given size. If you don't undergo any changes in your body, that's your size and you shouldn't accept any bras that are a different size. This is so so important.",

How far apart are your boobs? Do you have wide or narrow roots? Are you shallow or projected? How tall is your ribcage?\n\nJust as an example: I have NO space between my boobs, and I have a short ribcage.

The model in that post you linked is definitely not an F cup, I would have put them at about a US 34K or something.\n\nThe bra they are modeling is way too small, and you can tell by looking at the cleavage, and the fact that the cups are too far down on the model\u2019s chest. Do you see the area where the cup meets the strap, near the armpits? I\u2019d say that the bra needs to be about 4 inches higher up on the model\u2019s chest. Give it take, based on how tall they are and where their bust sits naturally.\n\nYou can also tell by the fact that the gore (middle part between the cups) is sitting *on* their cleavage, not on the sternum.

You\u2019ll need size 65.\n\nIt comes from (I\u2019m assuming) this silly idea that people in the US and UK should add 4 inches to their band sizes (so someone who measures 30 inches should wear size 34). Europe did not want to tell people \u201chey you need to add 10 cm\u201d, so instead they put those 10 cm into the sizing. That means a size 75 band will fit someone with an ~85 cm underbust, not 75 cm.",

At a 10 inch difference we\u2019re already at J cup if we go by using the alphabet as it is. Many UK brands go up to a KK cup (P cup in a normal alphabet), so there\u2019s lots of people who need those sizes as well. After P there\u2019s still a good handful of sizes left until you get to Z. While conditions like macromastia and breast hypertrophy might be not be super common, there\u2019s many people with those conditions.\n\nThere\u2019s a Canadian brand who makes bras that start the alphabet over again when it gets to Z. So the size after Z is not ZZ, but ZA, then ZB, ZC, and so on. I think that\u2019s a good solution as well.\n\nThere\u2019s another reason why I think many people like UK sizing. Saying that you have GG cup might sound less \u201cextreme\u201d for some people, than saying J cup. A lot of people are horrified when they learn their actual cup size, because there\u2019s a lot of hurtful language around breasts, like \u201canything above a C cup means you\u2019re fat\u201d.

European size 95 would be for someone with a 90-95 cm underbust, if I'm not mistaken (range because I'm not sure which one it is in theory as in practice what size a woman wears also depends on her preferred comfort level and the \"padding\" she's got on her rib cage).\n\n>In French sizing, size 95 is for someone with a 90 cm underbust.\n\nAgain, that's European sizing. A French size 95 would be for someone with a 75-80 cm underbust.\n\nJust checked one of my bras: 60 in European sizing is equivalent to 75 in French sizing.\n\nEdit for anyone who might read this thread later: this is a mess and I misunderstood some of the points made by the previous commenter.

You got it the wrong way around.\n\nHere, you're telling me that me, a woman with a 60cm underbust who wears a European size 60 and French size 75 (once again, this is what is written on **one** bra), am simultaneously wearing a bra made for a 55cm underbust and a 85cm underbust ? What ?\n\nThere's also the US/UK size on the tag if you want: it's 28 (so US28 = FR75 = EU60). Because they add 4 inches (60cm=24in). And France does a weird thing too. In comparison, European sizing looks like the sane one.\n\nI don't know what the commenter you're copying is talking about, tbh. Maybe they're basing themselves off of an old standard that has since been changed ? Or maybe they/bra fitters confuse loose underbust measurement and tight underbust measurement ? On someone with a bit of fat on the ribcage I could easily see why two sizes smaller than the loose underbust measurement could be needed.",

But 60 cm is 24 inches, so the UK size is adding 4 inches to the European size. Are you saying that European sizes **remove** 4 inches so that 65 means 75, and that UK/US sizes are actually correct ? I thought the \"+4 inches\" thing was the other way around: English sizing adding a whole 4 inches on the tags because silly. And actually, salespeople have tried using the +4 thing to try and put me into whooping UK32s even though I'm tiny, so I did have a reason to be confused.\n\nAlso, I don't know if it's because I'm such a small size that I'm completely out of the market and thus might have never ever seen a bra of my \"correct\" size let alone tried one, but I don't see how my 60 to 65 cm (24 to 26 inches) underbust could fit in a FR65 = EU50 = UK26, let alone one more size smaller, so I'm a bit skeptical still. Also if you're right I need to have a chat with the calculator of r/ABraThatFits because it also said I'm a UK28.\n\nI think I need to just stop wearing bras if I want my brain to survive.\n\nThanks for taking the time to explain btw.",

Which makes it confusing that a band size called \u201c60\u201d used to fit me when my underbust was ~70 cm. But I\u2019m not trying to trick you or lie to you here.\n\nStores will say that 32 is the right band size for you, because adding 4 inches to your underbust makes it easier for them to sell you a size they carry. I wear UK 30FF/EU 65H right now, but most stores would put me in a 34D/75D. That size doesn\u2019t fit me comfortably, and I have tried it (and surrounding sizes like 75C and 75E) from many different stores. 65H (or sometimes 65I) seems to work best for me in every brand.\n\nI often see people with band sizes below 34 prefer to size up. So if your measurement is between 24 and 26, you might prefer a 26 (or even a tight 28). Many people I know with band sizes above 34 prefer to size down. I have one friend who was suggested a 36 band, but is most comfortable in a 34. It seems to have something to do with how much give, or \u201csquish\u201d, your skin has.\n\nNo problem.

They are paying for the picture- *that\u2019s it*. Absolutely *nothing* entitles them to more than that. The simple fact that they even act like she owes them more than what she\u2019s charging them for is them treating her like a product. She\u2019s not a phone, she\u2019s not a car, so those examples on how you purchase those have no place here at all. It\u2019s not the same business, it\u2019s not even the same business approach. If they don\u2019t like it, then they need to find something else. It\u2019s pretty simple.\n\nEdit- nothing like deep-rooted misogyny to keep your Friday going \ud83d\ude44 There are 3 kinds of people who would think this behavior is okay: 1) blatant misogynists 2) people who don\u2019t have the self reflection skills to see they\u2019re misogynistic and 3) dumbasses. Maybe take time to self reflect on why you think women owe you more than what you\u2019re paying them for.",

Why does logic and reason just fly out the window when talking about this stuff? **No one claimed she is required to do anything**. They are pointing out how these reactions to someone *wanting* her to does not make sense and makes you/her look incredibly silly. If someone goes to a garage sale and asks a couple questions about or related to something they\u2019re selling, *the person selling is obviously not forced or required to answer*, **but it\u2019s really fucking weird to act like they\u2019re crazy or weird for asking**. It\u2019s so simple. You\u2019re so excited to call people misogynists that you\u2019ll do anything, including completely separate yourself from reality to make absolute nonsensical Reddit comments.

Which ultimately proves how garbage OP is on the business aspect for the sake of some below-par pornography a twelve year old boy only might find cool. Having your business on Reddit out of all places, no wonder she ain't successful on OF. Can't have your cake and eat it too.\n\nE-thots like her are absolute cancer. I won't get into debate if sex work is work, because it is. But I don't respect it since people sell their self-worth for easy money because they don't want to do decent work (if they have the means to, of course).\n\nBut we all can collectively agree that the dude is a moron, not because of the question of bra size, but because of his \"do your own research\" shtick, which is the only reason as to why this post is on this particular subreddit. And that she was being a bitch in her replies. \n\nA baker wouldn't tell you to \"guess\" the size of their cakes, but she does to her own product. Which is a reason as to why no one wants her product (the other reason being because of the insane prices, and I'm guessing this is due to her low amount of customers and even lower self-esteem. No wonder she's so rude.)",

The letter represents your overbust measurement with your underbust measurement subtracted - an A is a 1 inch difference, a DD is a 5 inch difference and a GG is a 10 inch difference.\n\nEU sizing will give you a migraine but works off the same principle, but is in cm and has 10cm padded into the band. So if you're a 70cm underbust, you'd wear a 60 band. The cup sizing works largely the same but the letter progression is different as there are no double letters iirc.\n\nThe form of your breast is called shape, and there's generally two kinds - projected and shallow. That cannot be told by the bra size, but some specific measurements can indicate which way someone is leaning.",
