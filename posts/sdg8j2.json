I'm saying that the absence of a religion to push back against the notions of government effectively *makes* a theocratic state *itself*, with government prescribing morality. That's *far* more dangerous than when law was separate from morality and pointed at minimal involvement in our lives.\n\nWhere we saw variation in behavior in the past, religious society had a live and let live mantra that could be applied. No longer. Now it's dictatorial moralism demanding compliance and painting the non-compliant as evil-doers. The extra dangerous part is that it pushes for uniformity in behavior with a monopoly on violence via government.\n\nI think it's pretty apparent that certain religious communities massively outperform others. Certain societies are more productive and functional. Perhaps religion 'just telling you what to do' works better when they tell you the right things to do?\n\nPerhaps the law standing back and letting better outcomes rise naturally is better than it becoming your religion and cramming down on the non-subscribers.",

Nothing but virtue signaling. No solutions, no discussion just a shouting match on who is the most oppressed and the most \"moral\"\n\nThere is definitely a problem with workers rights and it's a very good cause to fight for. But take example from your fathers and grandfathers who actually fought and won 50-70 years ago. A bunch of mentally unstable teens on an internet forum pretending to be revolutionaries and declaring that \"laziness is a virtue\" are pathetic and deserve all the ridicule they get. \n\nRedittors and twitards  just don't realize that the real world is actually hard work to get what you want and simply shouting what you want and removing those who don't agree with you only works in your shitty safe space circlejerk",

In a completely unexpected turn of events, it turns out that a mcretard that constantly spins on their chair, clean their room, or use proper lighting isn't a good representative of the population that works 80 hours of the week. It doesn't help that they're bad at math as well since they prior said that they only work 2 hours for 5 days of the week.",
