Saying teachers are underpaid for the amount of work they do and shit they put up with is just a statement of fact, nothing more.\n\nyou can say the same about retail, hospitality, social work, restaurant management, and many other professions as well. That doesn't make the statement that teachers are underpaid untrue nor does it imply that only teacher should be paid more.\n\nwith that said, it really depends a lot on the district where you work. On average, teachers are underpaid, in some districts embarrassingly so, but there are a few districts that pay quite well and many more that pay adequately.\n\nThe benefits however have been eroded for decades now. The idea of teachers getting great benefits is a bit on an anachronism. That's not to say the benefits are awful, they just aren't anything out of the ordinary either. Health insurance is generally crap and overpriced, the pension system is nice but can be lost due to a hostile legislature and we don't get to draw social security on top of the pension, at least not in my state. Our 403Bs are standard.",

I'm crossing out homeless because there's not really female homeless people, they can just sit on the side of the road and get $100+ a day panhandling or just get a boyfriend, or actually living in a homeless shelter and getting helped. Of course there's not zero of them, they're just extremely extremely rare. I've never heard of a single case of a homeless hooker. Maybe if anything they'd be homeless for 3 days before they're just living out of a hotel from their profits.",

Someone else might prefer an escort because they are shy/not socially skilled enough to have success on apps. Someone could use escorts because there is less chance of being robbed or assaulted. Maybe they have a favorite sex worker they like. \n\nI mean, straight men pay for sex even when they have other options because they want to.

They are, as a rule, nice people, some are, for lack of a better term, \"higher class\" than others.  One that I gave a ride to on a semi-regular basis, and had no problem talking freely about her business, had a master's degree in journalism, and was considering going back to school for another degree.  But according to her, she made good money, and enjoyed what she did, so was in no hurry to get a \"regular\" job.\n\nIn talking with them, I get the impression that $100 would be on the low end of the scale as far as a \"date\" with them, and some of them (including the lady with the graduate degree) would not even consider meeting a guy for that amount.\n\nThe \"higher class\" ladies would probably start around $500 for an hour of their time, and go up from there, I know the lady with the graduate degree said she charged $3500 for an overnight stay, with dinner at a nice restaurant, and dancing/movie/show/other activity also paid by the client **required**, not just banging away for the whole night.\n\nI don't know how many people she saw a year, but I suspect certainly less than one per day.\n\nSome of the other ladies, who were not among the \"higher class\", told me that most of their day was spent texting or talking on the phone to prospective clients, but a couple told me that most of the time, those prospects ended up ghosting them, so a lot of time trying to reel the fish in, but not a lot of success.  Sometimes no success at all.  Plus all the risks that go along with allowing such intimate contact with strangers.\n\nAnd before anyone asks, no, I don't have phone numbers, nor will I give any clues about who they are, or how to get in touch with them.  I'm not a pimp, and don't want to have any discussions with law enforcement about these ladies.  I don't have a problem with what they do, and I personally believe the laws in the majority of the US regarding sex workers are backward, short-sighted, and stupid.",

Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the \u201closer,\u201d and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3\u00d75 card reading, \u201cPlease use this M&M for breeding purposes.\u201d This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&Ms. I consider this \u201cgrant money.\u201d I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one.",

Like going to college will make you wealthy, haha, cute, funny, hilarious. But not true. \n\nIf they did want to prostitute themselves, they could most likely get away with doing guys for $500 for one session, which means if they look really good like a 9/10 aesthetic they can easily charge $1k+ & men out there would still pay. If they did 2 to 3 guys a day that's 2k to 3k a day. \n\nBut realistically no human being would want to do it every single day of the year, that's too draining mentally & physically. Lets say they do it half of the days in a year. \n\n182 \\* 2500 is $455,000.\n\nProstitution is illegal in America, so how tf will they pay their taxes?\n\nClaim self employment and say its from Onlyfanz or camgirl or twitch or all their instagram/tik tok influencing?
