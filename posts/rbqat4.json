Just because the bomb didn't completely reduce anything to rubble doesnt mean that the thing was spared.\n\nAfaik, if a bomb explodes and something is damaged by the explosion, then it counts as 'the thing got bombed' or 'the thing survived the bombing'",

By making Bishops essentially state employees the Government gets to set standards for bishops, like a PHD at a public university.

Just compare the German catholic church where many bishops officially want to allow female catholic priests, with the American catholic church that calls the current pope the antichrist behind closed doors because he is trying to not be a total asshole.\n\nOf course you can do that way cheaper by cutting out the middleman from all those church hospitals and other social institutions that are government funded and but church run. And of course in a better world religion would not exist.\n\nBut keeping at least bishops as regulated government employees is a good thing that should be expanded to mosques and other religious centers as well, as it gives the government a say and some control over the \"teachings\" made by religions.",

Getting it back is difficult and sometimes impossible. There are countries handling the problem and finding the people doing this tax fraud, for example Great Britain.\n\nIn Germany the \"Federal Financial Supervisory Authority\" got the information to go after those people, same information the Brits got. He and his agency said that the information are not suitable to do THE EXACT SAME THING the Brits are doing.\n\nScholz was the mayor of Hamburg and the Warttburg bank stole 47 mio Euros. It is proven that he met in this time 3 times with the owners of the bank and failed to start investigations against them.\n\nHe denies what he had to deny and the rest he \"cannot remember\". So if you are benelovent, you could say he made a terrible, huge mistake and let people steal money from the government (which is btw still possible, so if people are getting away, they will do it again). If you are not so benelovent you could say it was a deliberate obstruction of justice. \n\nIt is a difficult topic, which is why people don't inform themselves about it. Most people don't understand what a huge thing that is, that a lot of mighty people are involved and those people are pressuring and influencing people in politics. \n\nScholz is now the mightiest person in Germany. This is a terrible terrible thing for everyone who isn't super rich, it's almost as bad as American politics.\n\nBut that is not all. In the huge wirecard scandal Olaf Scholz is again the responsible person as the finance minister, 30 billion lost again.",

How much got caught or found out and whether or not it was everything is unknown. Now it's just a couple of millions as far as the public knows but his government did get rid of a whole lot of documents shortly before the investigation and swept all of it under the rug multiple times. It helped him a lot that the subject matter is rather difficult to grasp, so the public was not as outraged as it could have been.\n\nHe also severely underestimated the security risks of a G20 summit which caused a lot of damage to the city of Hamburg and pissed the whole city off big time. \n\nHe's still the least corrupt alternative compared to everyone the christian democratic party had to offer and he's by all accounts a proper statesman. He came across as rather boring but generally liked in Hamburg pre G20. Not as much afterwards and he quickly left for Berlin shortly thereafter.",

Dividends being a form of income (if not held in some sort of tax sheltered investment vehicle, which I have no knowledge for in Germany) would be taxed. \n\nMy guess is that there was some alleged fuckery in registering stock sales for dates around the dividend date to get around paying taxes/fraudulently requesting a refund. It's been done before.",

On a three votes ballot with first, second and third choice you can also choose if you give all of them to one party, to one specific candidate within a party, so they\u2019ll more likely get in despite of perhaps their lower ranking within said party, to different parties and to different candidates as well. (Counting them all accordingly is of course another process, but overall it helps voters feel like their votes actually count, even if it is just for a smaller party).\n\nOf course the system over here ain\u2019t perfect and our laws allowed merkel to stay chancellor for\u2026 16 years now I think\u2026 and let\u2019s just say its downsides and flaws have shown over here.\n\nThere are after a heckton of reasons why the CDU this election had a historic low, even without mentioning how much they messed up the covid-response in hindsight (current high infection rates in Germany are still a result from the CDU\u2019s incompetence in that during their election campaign).\n\nEven if the current coalition looks like neoliberalism with a green coat over in the US\u2026\n\nmay I just mention that first, we are glad that the CDU is out (okay, tbf. Spd was in government as well during that time, however most of the time they were the smaller party in that regard and every other coalition attempt tended to fail, so they\u2019re tolerated for now)\n\nAnd secondly for comparison that Bernie sanders over here would\u2019ve been seen as a more conservative politician for his policies.\n\nI may have delved deeper than at first intended into the subject matter here\u2026",

(I know it is in the US and a source of many political annoyances for the voters.)\n\nThen there is also the 5% hurdle for parties that they have to pass to get into parliament in the first place (a result from the chaos that happened without it during the Weimar Republic times, that ended up aiding the nazis into power as well, since it made the policy making impossible and the rule very unstable\u2026 unfortunately afd is still above that hurdle as a true right wing protest party there).\n\nAh yeah, and prior to a election you can participate in you usually get a letter with the date and location on where you can vote\u2026 and choose to either take the letter with you as proof, request to vote per mail, or just take your ID card there, so local helpers know that it is you who voted and not some rando (will usually take a bit longer to find your name and number then, but it is also accepted).\n\nAdditionally elections are always on a Sunday where most shops and businesses are closed here (yeah, that\u2019s an actual thing and yeah that had religious reasons originally, but nowadays it\u2019s just part of the week for most living in Germany independent of confession), so work will be less likely to get into your way of doing your civic duty of voting.\n\nAlso: you can participate in a local election as well, if you\u2018ve been living around the area for long enough (I think half a year is enough, but I might be wrong on that one).\n\nWhat\u2019s another thing? Campaign times being far shorter than in the US, meaning you\u2018ve got to get permits for most ways of campaigning as a party, for example especially with targeted online campaigns, while that time length overall is at most\u2026 two months I think? Maybe a half one more if want voters to hate your face with absolute distain?\n\nThere is so much more I could talk about, but most of these are easier to explain when you are there during an election, be it small and local or big an national or even EU wide (that one is a different can of worms overall though, since it\u2019s in this case an election through local national parties there).\n\nBut otherwise that\u2019s it for now",

They figured NDP supporters would put Liberal as their #2 to keep the fascist Cons from winning, and Cons would put Liberal as #2 to keep the commie NDP from winning, ensuring nearly every election would be a Liberal victory.\n\nI'm a fan of mixed member proportional representation.  This system still lets people vote for their local representative, without throwing away the votes of everyone who voted for the non-winning candidate.\n\nIt will pretty much ensure majority governments never happen again, and if you look at Canadian history, our greatest programs were formed by minority governments working together with other parties.",

And without the greens climate change won't be addressed in a sustainable way at all. This is the first hurdle and it won't move.\n\n2. Economic feasability. It doesn't pay enough to run nuclear power in Germany. Most companies originally interested in doing so have already said that they won't spend the initial cost again.\n\n3. Technical feasability/necessity. Even if we assume that nuclear energy is a preferable way to produce low carbon emission energy, it would still not be suitable for Germany anymore. The old reactors are not safe to reopen, we would desperately need new generation reactors and without **SEVERE** government subsidies and law bending, they would not be up and running fast enough to make a significant impact until other low carbon solutions are ready to take over.",

              "text": "> if you make $60k+ a year you will have a higher standard of living here than anywhere in Western Europe.\n\nHard LOL! Only 35% of households have an income of $60k+... Of course, If you're rich, you will have a higher standard everywhere, not just the US. 55% of American households earn less than $50k, and 30% less than $25k. Good luck raising a family on that!\n\n> Gasoline is $6.93 a gallon on average in Germany. It gas was that much here people would riot.\n\nFirst, those are due to taxes for climate change: money is redistributed back to the population as a whole. 2nd Germany, just like Switzerland, and other Western countries have mostly built for pedestrians and cyclists. Most people *walk/cycle* to school and for grocery. And also public transportation is widespread and affordable. \n\n>  it\u2019s still cheaper to live here because of lower taxes\n\nYour infrastructures are falling apart, many of your schools heavily underfunded (with poor teachers having to finance students' books and lunches), your under-financed universities cater to students like a Gucci store to clients, look what happened in Texas and its electrical grid, [your government has legalized corruption and is  selling itself to the highest bidders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig), US government debt is exploding, \n\nLow taxes aren't necessarily a good thing!\n\n> French politics are at least as fucked as US politics.\n\nBut they do deliver: virtually free education (up to a master degree) and universal healthcare, 30 days/year of paid holiday, lengthy paternity and maternity leave, strong workers' rights, etc. etc.",

                  "text": "I think you are missing swaths of what I said. It does indeed suck to be poor in the US, or to live in shitty conservative states like Texas (which I explicitly used as an example), and we need to fix that with better regulations and by getting people healthcare. You'll find no argument from me on those subjects. It is not hard, however, to make significantly more than the median income, if you go to college and try a bit. But if you make any amount of real money, it is better to live here. \n\n\nI live in a conservative, shithole of a state, and my college was almost all paid for by the state and federal governments. I paid out less than $6k over three years of a bachelors degree (I took college classes, 100% subsidized, during high school, so I graduated early). Nearly everyone who went there worked at least part time. Very few graduated with any debt. It is a state university. Frankly, when you see astronomical student debt, it was avoidable every time. Don't bother going to college if the degree you want won't land you a job that makes any money. Don't go to a private university where a 4 year degree costs $125k. That's stupid, and if you do that, it's your fault. The taxpayer shouldn't have to pay out for fantastically high priced tuition. Most people don't need to go to college anyway, employers need to nut up and train people instead of expecting the employee to pay for it. I see entry level jobs wanting Master's degrees because everyone now has Bachelor's degrees. It's stupid. \n\n\nWe wouldn't have electric cars as a viable alternative to fossil fuel powered ones if Tesla hadn't been founded. Elon Musk, btw, didn't actually found Tesla. The United States has been and remains the greatest center of innovation and higher learning the world over. It would not have been possible to do, certainly not as quickly, elsewhere. If gasoline was taxed here at the rate it is in Europe, then all of those people who don't make significant money wouldn't be able to go to their jobs or travel anywhere. It's just not how things can work here. \n\n\nInfrastructure is actually being addressed by the current government. A trillion dollars towards repair and replacement is a great thing. It will create good paying construction and project manager jobs, and keep the economy moving along nicely. Under funded schools are an issue only in poor areas. There are many issues pertinent to the US educational system. Currently, funding is from property taxes. Therefore, rich areas with expensive housing have well funded schools, and poor areas get shit. Tying funding to standardized test scores has to go, as do teachers unions. Generally I am pro-union, but teachers unions are a massive part of the problem here, protecting bad teachers and acting to pass regressive policy. My opinion is that property taxes need to be pooled statewide and then distributed based on the number of students. Also, teacher salary needs to double at a minimum and there need to be twice as many teachers. It is an issue. But again, if you make enough to send your kids to private school, they'll get a vastly superior education. I went to both private and public schools (mostly private), and the difference once I got to college was apparent immediately. \n\n\nThe US debt isn't an issue. It's denominated in USD which we can obviously print more of any time. The only way the US government defaults on debt is if it chooses to. It won't. Most of it is in 30/20/10 year Treasury securities, paying out well below inflation. Other governments also have big debts. The difference being, the US debt is still backed by the largest economy in the world. \n\n\nIn summary and summation, if you make less than $60k USD a year, Europe is nicer. If you make that or over, and live in a decently nice area, then Europe offers you no real benefits. One of these days we're going to get universal healthcare and that'll solve so many issues.",

Contrary to popular belief, WW1 reparations weren't harsh, it's a myth, German government simply didn't want to pay.\n\n>  creating more evil by driving people from their homes. \n\nYou mean German people who were sent by Nazi Germany as colonists to Germanize Poland? Or those who had Polish slaves? Pretty much every German household used slave labour.\n\n> Why did you ask for Poland and not Czechoslovakia if they had it that much worse?\n\nFirstly Czechoslovakia didn't have it worse than Poland. About 300k Czechoslovaks died, 270k of them Jews. Meanwhile 6 million Poles died, 3million of them Jews.  Occupation of Czechoslovakia was mild compared to Poland. Secondly because OP mentioned Poland.",

And maybe the new government will go a different route than the conservatives.\n\nThis is what's being discussed in the green party:\n\n>Germany must show \"that it is prepared to do its homework. To this end, Sarrazin has now submitted six concrete proposals in a paper. For example, as part of a humanitarian gesture, Germany should set up a fund from which medical costs for still-living victims of war and occupation can be covered. Another fund should be used as a \"gesture of goodwill\" to pay compensation to victims or their children who have not been taken into account in previous payments. There are still \"hardly considered blind spots of German guilt during war and occupation in Poland\". This applies to the so-called partisan and hostage shootings, but also to the death lists of the Reich Security Main Office from the first weeks of the war and the victims of the \"People's German Resistance.\n>\n>In addition, a framework for the support of Polish culture was to be created. After all, the goal of the German occupation policy was not least to destroy Polish culture. Sarrazin calls for \"symbolic compensation\" for places where Germans committed war crimes. In addition, all murder victims of the occupation should be documented, if possible. A \"correct and important step\" would also be Germany's willingness to \"contribute substantially to a major cultural project in Poland.\"\n\n\nBtw. that's Manuel Sarrazin, not known racist and grifter Thilo Sarrazin.",

I lived in Berlin for a while and the only indications that religion exists, were the church bells and mosques making noises every now and then. And those were barely audible within a metropolis like Berlin. The north-east is a wild mixture between the most conservative and the most liberal people however. They clash together in regular demonstrations for whatever minor reason but none of them are because of anything christianity related. The east is especially known for being quite poor. If you ever plan to go there - leave out most parts in the east. Dresden, Berlin and Leipzig are fine, the rest should be avoided.\n\nThe west is more modern and peaceful, the south the most old fashioned (and religious). Especially in bavaria, you'll still find tons of crucifixes randomly displayed in forests and fields.\n\nThe churches are allover tame here however. They're not invasive, they won't go out of their way to convert you, they're just...there. Only mildly annoying if anything.",

If anything, atheism and agnosticism are natural companions. If you don't believe knowledge of something is possible, nothing compels you to believe it exists *or* to believe it does not. [This lack of belief is called atheism.](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atheism)\n\nAtheism also refers to people who actively disbelieve that *your* pet god doesn't exist, but I suppose those atheists are comparatively few. Since it amounts to defining oneself in terms of what one does not do, it would be like Baptists meeting on Saturday night for the express purpose of *not* dancing.",

That goes against literally every scientific principal there is. Does it mean that there is not a God or higher being? No. That's why it's called a belief. Religious people look at things they don't understand and chalk it up to a higher power. Atheists look at things they don't understand and think \"wow, I can't wait until science has figured this one out\".\n\nBelieving that there is a God because of a lack of knowledge is an argument from ignorance.
