  "text": "TIFU by scaring my partner\nwoke up at 4 am to some of the most severe abdominal cramps of my life. I nearly threw up, took 4 acetaminophen and waited for them to work. They didn't work. I woke up my partner, worried that my IUD had gotten misaligned during sexy time earlier and that I needed to go to the ER just in case. \n\nThey're panicking, I'm panicking, I'm crying in pain. \n\nWe get into the car to go to the ER, both of us frantic. \n\nHalfway there, it happens, \n\nMy body lets out the loudest, longest, nastiest fart of my life and all the pain goes away.\n\nI'm not joking when I tell you it filled the entire car with the stench of rotten eggs and death. \n\nMy poor partner is choking for air as we turn around and go home. They're not mad at me but I feel awful for it. I'm gonna get up early and make them a good breakfast as an apology and luckily they have today off.\n\nTL;DR I thought they broke my IUD, lots of pain, on the way to the ER, I farted, pain went away, we went home..",

Yeah, bad gas.  Baby hot gotten big enough combined with more-than-routine pregnancy constipation, she had a gas bubble in her left upper quadrant we could see on chest X-ray that was causing her pain. \n\n I tell that story to all ER patients who come in crying with pain from gas/constipation that feel embarrassed after work up shows nothing serious.  Severe gas pains can mimic life threatening disorders.",

          "text": "On Monday my husband had open inguinal hernia surgery, fine for most of the day but around 6 hours post op started getting pain that I recognized as gas pain. Unfortunately, it's not like he could just bare down and fart. It was coming in waves, and at about 11pm (10-11 hours post op) we called the nurses line because it was really bad. They asked if he was able to stand and walk. I got him up, and he immediately was throwing up, cold sweats, and in excruciating pain. I had to call 911. \n\n2 doses of fentanyl on the way to the hospital and 2 of morphine earlier in the visit (that did *nothing* for him) he would still call me screaming in pain. It was the middle of the night, I wasn't allowed with him, and he was in a hall. I had to go into the waiting room and advocate for him because he wasn't being treated well. He was finally given dilaudid which helped but made him throw up even more. Blood work was standard, CT was standard, and he didn't see a doctor for 7 hours. All for them to say \"he just engaged his abs too much\" which wasn't even true.\n\nThe nurses lied to me, told me they were waiting on CT results when he hadn't even gotten the CT. The nurses were openly breaking HIPAA, talking about patients using full names and describing their charts in front of everyone. The CT tech almost made him asphyxiate on his own vomit when they strapped him down and refused to listen when he said he was gonna throw up, then the tech ripped his IV out of his arm and ripped the blanket out from where it was, placed near the incision. \n\nMy husband thought he was dying, and that the staff didn't even care to try to figure out why.\n\nIt was hands down the worst medical experience either of us have had. My best friend who is a surg tech and my sister in law who is a nurse, both agreed it was more than likely gas pain and a vasovagal response to the pain from it. \n\nI was also surprised to find out they didn't even give him a Zofran for the road, he was immediately throwing up in my car after discharge, and we had to wait 2 hours for the pharmacy to open. \n\nHes good now, but definitely popped a stitch or 2 during the whole process. We just hope it was only exterior stitches and not any on the actual hernia fix itself.",

The surface ships I was on sometimes had a \"movie night\" in berthing, but each large berthing usually had like a lounge type of area with a tv in it, so it was up to each berthing, basically. We did have a dodge ball tournament in the hangar bay of the Bonhomme Richard underway once though, that was pretty cool.",

I\u2019m glad you are ok. 12k is still a lot. realistically it\u2019s not a lot to have but it\u2019s a lot to need. \n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re ok!\n\nBut still, as a young person here where the average house price where you live, you know you\u2019ll never afford- it gives a sick feeling. And to know that is common with people in my generation across Canada, it does not bode well for our future. We have so much foreign investment and speculation. And in turn the current homeowners are afraid to sell because they a) hope for a bigger payout in the future b) are afraid they are priced out as well. Not sure how in tune you are with Canadian media but it\u2019s a huge crisis and we are all feeling it. So many young people I\u2019ve talked to about it are waiting for the \u201cnext big crash\u201d. Which is sad to plan your life along something like that. \n\nAnyways, to summarize- yes I can break my leg/have a baby (but can\u2019t house them lol)/get cancer and not go broke! But I also can\u2019t buy a house, and a basket of goods/foodstuffs is rising like crazy. Im not comparing our struggles cause they both suck and need to be addressed. But it points to some bigger picture issues that both Canada and the US need to address!!! Best of luck - we can do a trade, a house on your side of the border and medical care on ours \ud83d\ude1b",

Your description of the Canadian housing market and cost of living situation closely mirrors what is happening across the many cities I've lived in in the US on both coasts. The cost of housing, transportation, education, food, and medical care, have gone up dramatically over the past 30 years, while wages have barely kept up with inflation until very recently.\n\nMost of my coworkers are in their mid to late 30s, and have no hope of ever buying a house here in Utah on our current salaries. I'm honestly not sure what the long-term outlook for us is either, maybe we'll be renting well into our 50s and 60s, and forced to retire way out in the remote countryside or maybe a flyover state like Oklahoma or North Texas. Maybe in a generation or two, we'll see the return of multi-generational housing, with multiple generations living under one roof in much smaller houses. Regardless, the future does seem dystopian, right?\n\nHang in there, My plan B is to retire in South America where I was born, where I could easily afford a small property and live comfortably. I would miss the amenities, as well as my friends and family here in the US terribly, but financially, I don't see how I'm ever going to retire unless I land a much higher paying job",

Also curling into the fetal position and uncurling. If you can't lay I also suggest squatting all the way down then stand up. I like to squat because it's good for the muscles but I accidentally found out it's great to get gas moving. Fair warning I'm no doctor, this is just anecdotal evidence. Gotta get the guts to move. There is one yoga move I like that I've always heard called \"wind relieving pose\" which involves laying on your back and drawing your knees up to your chest.  Might be better for someone not in shape enough to kick their legs",

I had to explain that \"yes, I know about it, no, it won't make me fart _less_\".\n\n[Edit] Because I wasn't clear enough, the reason it's in quotes is because she is literally the only person I've ever met who had this opinion, and I've worked with a great number of people in much closer quarters than I worked with her. I fart a perfectly normal amount, thank you, she was just of the opinion that any farts ever = problem [/Edit]\n\n[Edit2] Everyone saying that I've somehow only ever met people who are too polite to comment on it, I have had more than one girlfriend. Sometimes the breakups involved a list of my faults. You honestly,  _honestly_, think \"you fart too much\" wouldn't make that list?[/Edit2]\n\n[Edit3] To those people who seem to believe that she's somehow a credible source, this is the same woman who, when my girlfriend (now wife) stopped by the office one time, she said \"I always wondered what kind of person would ever want to be with him\". IN FRONT OF ME.  That's the person whose word you're taking over that of me, my family, my friends, and my wife. She was a huge bitch.[/Edit3]",

Usually, we'd only hang out a few hours, and then go our way and what not. But this time, we're outside her dorm and just talking for a while. Pain started around 9pm from holding in gas, and i didn't get home until 3am. The second she left my car, I started farting. But the pain was still there. Just assumed I really had to poop.   \n\n\nGet home, I poop, still feel pain, but I also feel like I haven't pooped out all the poop, but nothing im doing is making it come out so I go to bed.    \n\n\nwake up at 8am to go to work, try pooping again. still feel pain. But it still feels like \"gas pain\". It's constant, but it's not \"omg this hurts\" kind of pain, and nothing really made it worse.   \n\n\nUntil about halfway through my shift, I realize that walking is now making the pain worse. I worked retail at the time, and we weren't allowed to sit, but I got permission from a manager to sit on the stool. during my break, I made a doctors appointment. I told my boss before I made the appointment that if they had something available immediately, I would take it. but otherwise i'd just stay to the end of my shift (it was still largely \"discomfort\" over \"pain\" at this point). doctor's office had an opening right after my shift, so I took it.   \n\n\nGo to the doctors, doctor presses once on my stomach once and based on my facial expression alone goes \"yea you need to go to the ER\". Dad came and picked me up and took me to the hospital. Turns out I had acute appendicitis. The next morning they took it out. The pain was worse after the operation than before it, but I also get that it easily, and quickly, could not have been.   \n\n\nAnd all because I held in my fart while with my lady friend.    \n\n\nI've since had comparable pains while holding in gas. but nothing as bad as post-op. that first day post op was hell. and then they wanted me to go for a walk around the hospital floor, and i wanted to die.",

          "text": "A few years ago, (Typing this, I realized it was about 13 or so years ago) I was in agonizing pain. My stomach felt like it was imploding on itself. After a couple days, I called my PCP. Lady on the other end was like, \"it's probably just a stomach ache. ... I mean, if it really bothers you, we can schedule an appointment.\" \n\nSchedule that appointment. Doctor says, \"Well, I doubt it's appendicitis. It's been well over the grace period for your appendix to burst. Go home and rest.\"\n\nAfter a week, I couldn't move. I was hunched over in pain. My mother was like, \"we'll, I guess we'll head to the ER. Maybe they'll actually figure it out.\" \n\nI call my buddy:   \n\"Hey, man. Are you busy right now?\"     \n\"I just hopped on CoD, wanna join?\"     \n\"Actually, I was hoping you could take me to the hospital.\"     \nHis end went something like: \"YOU MOTHER FUCKER! WHY THE FUCK DID YOU ASK ME TO TAKE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL? NO! YOU FUCKING TELL ME YOU NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL! I'M ALREADY ON THE ROAD, ILL BE THERE IN 2 MINUTES!\"\n\nWe get to the hospital and the nurses are giving us a hard time. Telling us it's probably just the stomach flu because it's been a week since I've been in pain. My mother starts yelling at the lady, \"LOOK AT HIM! DOES THIS LOOK LIKE THE FUCKING FLU?\" \n\nThey finally took me back and gave me my contrast for the MRI.     \nBonus note, my vein is scarred from where the intern botched the IV and now I can't get blood drawn there. When having my blood drawn a few years ago, I was accused of being a heroin addict. That was fun. \n\nAnyways, I get into the MRI and the lady is like, \"I need you to take off your pants and any other metal.\" I get into the MRI and she immediately called to prep the OR. *It was, in fact, appendicitis. It took a week for it to rupture. I passed out. Pretty much as soon as I got into the bed. \n\n\nI was in the hospital for 2 or 3 weeks and was so fucking high. My friend who drove me there came with my other-friend and other-friend's girlfriend. \n\nThey asked to see my scar. Well, they got to see my dick as well.",

One could do that trick where they could suck small amounts of air in through their butthole and fart on command. I couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it, but I can do the burp stuff. I sat there just sucking in and swallowing air for a good while, wondering if it would come out as a giant fart. After about 10-15 minutes, I was in a fetal position on the tent floor. My stomach hurt so bad. After about another 5 or so minutes it all sank down to the danger zone. There was no time to make it across the campground to the public facilities. I hauled ass towards the tree line, dropped my pants and proceeded to shoot shit all into the woods. It was seriously like awful smelling grapeshot out of a blunderbuss. The smell wafted all the way from the tree line to our tent for like 20 minutes. I learned that night how badly people shit can smell when not submerged under water. My friends and I still refer to that night as the \u201cAlpo Prime Cuts & Gravy\u201d night due to the shit debris shotgun and the ass gravy that went with it. Never tried it again after that.",

Some weeks I will poop everything out each morning no problem, but other weeks I just know the sick is building up into rock hard bricks.\n\nI will take a dose of miralax when the gas build ups get painful. Gigantic farts I take over the toilet incase any poop wants to come out. I generally will feel relief when I get the mass amounts of gas out.\n\nMy last experience with miralax was bizarre. It usually worked within 24 hours for me. Last time it took like 4-5 days. I began to figure I would need to step it up to get all the poop out.\n\nWelp finally one morning it all hit me. Insanely massive amounts of miralax softened turds just escaped my ass.\n\nThe pile in the bottom of the toilet was insane. It iceberged the toilet bowl and broke the surface. It smelled so awful. I felt empty on the inside in a good way, like I had just popped the biggest fucking zit ever.\n\nlol I can\u2019t believe I got gold for this! Thank you all for your support!",

When I went to my dad's house for the weekend, he bought me a bottle of laxatives. The dose for my age (as I recall nearly 3 decades later) was 3 teaspoons. I was taking it all weekend, but after taking it on Sunday morning, I noticed the measuring cup I had been using was in tablespoons rather than teaspoons. Sunday afternoon, we went fishing in a local state park (fishing is legal and encouraged in this one). At one point, I got the urge to pee and was walking away to find a good place with some bush cover. Didn't make it halfway when I unloaded in my pants against my will. My sphincter didn't have the strength the resist that flood. Waddled back and went home to cleanup. Took another dump in the toilet that doubled the water level.",

My dad had to take care of my crippled grandfather and I was beginning to feel a bit more self-confident wanting to explore this new land.\n\nI never really got far from my father but this is sort of important to mention.\n\nWe were at the Baltimore aquarium and I think most likely I had some cheese pizza and Coca Cola for lunch. My bowels were having some weird stuff going on, traveler\u2019s constipation.\n\nSo we are walking throughout the aquarium and all of a sudden my bowels were just ready to let go. As cool as I can I tell my dad I\u2019m going to the bathroom, he lets me know he will wait outside by an exhibit near the bathroom.\n\nI go in and the entire bathroom is empty. It was like a Tuesday and I had been brought out of school for this trip. \n\nI get to a stall and proceed to let out the loudest, stinkiest diarrhea I have ever produced. This is worst then anything I have produced since, it was insane. It also wasn\u2019t one and done, it kept going.\n\nAbout a minute later a group of boys walk in, I believe they are on a school field trip. Immediately they are like \u201choly fuck that smell!\u201d to which I respond with another machine gun burst of diarrhea.\n\nI am mortified. The bathroom is full of boys reacting to my ass. I try to be as quiet as possible but the diarrhea does not want to be quieted and it does not want to end.\n\nEventually the boys all left and finally my ass can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I clean up as much as possible and get the hell out.\n\nMy dad and grandfather were right outside the door, seeming a bit worried. I had been in there for about 30 minutes, my dad was about to check on me.\n\nThey asked me \u201cwhat happened, traveler\u2019s diarrhea?\u201d. Surprised they seemed to know exactly what happened, I respond in the positive \u201cyes I just had the worst diarrhea ever!\u201d.\n\nThey asked me if I felt well enough to continue with the aquarium or if I wanted to go to the hotel. I tell you during the whole experience I wanted nothing more to be in privacy. But now that it was over, I felt different.\n\nI felt good.\n\nI had poophoria.",

I\u2019ve been almost 4 years off of street drugs but the methadone is really wracking my body, I\u2019m finally ready to be done.\n\nThe constipation issues combined with gas issues are just so insane. Some weeks I will poop everything out each morning no problem, but other weeks I just know the sick is building up into rock hard bricks.\n\nI will take a dose of miralax when the gas build ups get painful. Gigantic farts I take over the toilet incase any poop wants to come out. I generally will feel relief when I get the mass amounts of gas out.\n\nMy last experience with miralax was bizarre. It usually worked within 24 hours for me. Last time it took like 4-5 days. I began to figure I would need to step it up to get all the poop out.\n\nWelp finally one morning it all hit me. Insanely massive amounts of miralax softened turds just escaped my ass.\n\nThe pile in the bottom of the toilet was insane. It iceberged the toilet bowl and broke the surface. It smelled so awful. I felt empty on the inside in a good way, like I had just popped the biggest fucking zit ever.",

Methadone was the absolute worst opiate to kick. Heroin had nothing on it as far as withdrawal. Taper down to around 30mgs and switch over to subs, after 2-3 days of kicking. You have to get all the methadone out of your system before. I took it too early once and got precipitated withdrawals. Worst feeling ever. \n I loved methadone! More than my friends or family. It was killing me and I had to stop. I was under 100lbs and I\u2019m 5\u201911.  I wish you the very best and I hope you can beat your addiction. Suboxone really is better. Methadone will save your life. Suboxone gives you your life back.  Day at a time my friend.",

I have halved my dose from 160mg to 80mg in under a year. I\u2019m going to go slower now.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\nMaybe when I get to 20-30mg of methadone I can switch to subs and get off that way, I don\u2019t know and I have a while to go.\n\nI also wonder about Kratom. But for now I\u2019m stabilizing at 80mg and will continue to taper slowly from here. Already my libido has returned!",

I just have to go slowly. She can fuck right off if she believes she has control over how long it takes for me to get off. It is going to take however long it takes.",

If you have a decent relationship with your clinic counselor it might be worth having your partner come see them with you so they can explain to her how dangerous it is to rush through titration. My absolute idiot of an ex used to say shit like \"you've been taking this stuff for so long, you can't possibly need it anymore\" LIKE WHAT? Didn't matter how many times I tried to explain it to him that it actually worked the exact opposite way, he just didn't get it. \n\nNobody who hasn't gone through withdrawal has any right to dictate to you how fast you should wean yourself. They couldn't possibly wrap their heads around the physical and psychological misery of it. If your dose is still the first thing you think if when you wake up IMO you're not ready. It was only when I started to realize that I was forgetting to take it on a semi-regular basis in the morning that I felt ready to start going down again, and I've been holding at a 69mg split dose for awhile now because I'm not rushing it again.\n\n I'm also lucky that 1. I now have no out of pocket co-pays so I've lost the financial burden, 2. my clinic is in walking distance from my apartment so it's no trouble to get there, 3. I now only have to go once per week because of all the take homes I've earned and most importantly 4. my now-partner is of the opinion that he doesn't have a say in regards to that part of my life, so he supports whatever I decide to do. Add all that up and I'm really fine with taking my time. It's night and day compared to how it was before. \n\nWhy is she pressuring you? Is it the money? Because you could remind her how much money you used to blow on street drugs lol",

I realized I didn't really drink much water or much of anything. my parents started monitoring my water intake and things got better. My first year in college I ended up at the doctors with severe dehydration. They gave me 3 liters of IV fluids before they felt comfortable that I wasn't going to collapse. The nurse was joking with me they generally don't get men in here with dehydration this severe, its generally girls that were partying the night before and only drank alcohol the entire weekend.",

Thankfully no enemas lol. I just always thought it was normal unless you drank coffee or smoked. I was actually just diagnosed with gastroparesis (GP) last year after throwing up for days on end until I was hospitalized every 6 weeks and my GI dr did a gastric emptying study. You eat some foods with radioactive isotopes in it & then sit in front of a machine & it measures how fast the food drains from your stomach at different time intervals. At 4 hours, I still had 80% of food in my stomach. (Normal time frame is 1-2 hours). My GI thinks between my history of severe constipation & all the surgeries I\u2019ve had on my stomach it caused the GP. Last Oct, I had a J tube & PEG tube inserted and I am NPO except for clear liquids. I feed thru the J tube directly into my jejunum and I give meds and vent my stomach thru the PEG tube.",

My mother would feed me food I am allergic to then strap me into the back seat of the car and drive me around so I didn't have access to a toilet. This trauma broke my interoception signals so now as a 39 year old, I still have issues with knowing when I need to poop or pee. 99% of the time I go from not knowing I need to pee/poop to running to the toilet in two seconds bc I'm about to be incontinent. \n\nTL;DR: Butts are complicated when you're neurodivergent.",

I would hold it in and then forget to go when I got home and store poop for 3-5 days sometimes a week or over. I\u2019d then get such bad pain in my intestines that I wouldn\u2019t be able to walk. It always took awhile for this to happen and I never really felt \u201cfull\u201d. My father was a paramedic so brought me to see a Dr friend at the ER who did an ultrasound. He then asked me when the last time I pooped was and I couldn\u2019t tell him. I did tell him I pooped maybe once a week and thought that was normal, my poops were always just \u201cbig\u201d. He then proceeded to tell my dad and I that I have one of the longer intestinal bowel systems he\u2019s ever seen, like really long. Then he said \u201cno wonder you can hold your poop so long and not he uncomfortable!\u201d After all these revelations I then started to suffer the embarrassment of my dad telling all of his firefighter/paramedic friends about the size of my poops, \u201cthey\u2019re like my forearm!\u201d I personally knew when It was a \u201cgood one\u201d and I remember showing them one, and the look of amazement had me cracking up. They kept looking at tiny little me and wondering how something that size could come out of me. To this day if I don\u2019t make sure to poop once a day, I can usually clog the toilet with the shear amount. Thank you for reading about my bowels!",

My parents were like he sounds\u2026 fine but we ended up arriving at the vet anyways for imaging just in case. Vet calls me says my old chihuahuas sitting there staring at the er vet staff puzzled and they\u2019re also just scratching their heads at him too. $500 later we determine it was gas and because his breed isn\u2019t known to have bloat (bigger dogs like labs will) to next time monitor and massage the gas out. The vet did mention tho that he treated a pug last week with bloat so it wasn\u2019t totally out of question that\u2019s what it could have been. I just hated seeing my poor old pup suffering. We later had to put him down Dec 2021 after he had a seizure and passed out. RIP Finnigan",

She's stressed from work, I had just lost my job, and we lost a roommate so we aren't really focused on eating as well as we should. She calls me into the bathroom one night complaining about some intense stomach pain. The area she indicates is right where her appendix would be. She's crying from the pain, I'm freaking out because how are we going to afford this but my worst fear is that her appendix ruptures and she's in real trouble. She can't walk from the pain, it literally has her doubled over. So I pick her up, put her in the car and we drive to the ER. We're pulling into the parking lot and she says her anxiety is really acting up and she needs a minute to calm down before she goes inside which is normal for her. So we wait. About 2 min later she goes, I'm so sorry, and me knowing what's coming next starts to roll down the windows and she let's out the most putrid, drawn out, eye watering, nasal clearing fart I've ever heard come out of a human. She's suddenly feels perfect. She's of course embarrassed, I'm thinking that it was well worth the price of admission for that show compared to an ER visit.",

But my gut said something wasn\u2019t right. So I went to the ER. My BP was like 98/45. They did a CT with contrast & without contrast and didn\u2019t see anything but the dr told me that if I had a stroke & didn\u2019t get to the hospital within like 6 hours then it wouldn\u2019t show up on CT but a spinal tap would show it. So he did it and omg that HURT. My spinal fluid had blood in it, which indicated I did have a stroke & spent 3 days in ICU & another 4 in the hospital. That was in 2016. I still have short term memory problems but that\u2019s it thankfully. So now anytime I get a migraine I get paranoid that I\u2019m having another stroke.",

Unfortunately I was taken off anti-biotics a little too early while still at the hospital and wound up having to go through the procedure a second time because the infection came back.\n\nOnce at the hospital, the worst parts of the experience were just trying to use the bathroom and enduring the boredom of just sitting around in bed for a couple weeks. Wound up needing a catheter for some of the time so my bladder didn\u2019t burst from not being able to pee after the procedure.\n\nWhat I learned from the experience: if you\u2019re in enough pain that it\u2019s disturbing your sleep for several days, don\u2019t mess around - just go to the hospital.",

They can cause stomach ulcers and other gastric intestinal problems easily** I am of course not a doctor but what I am dealing with has been made many times worse because of taking ibuprofen\n\nIf you need to take pain medication and haven\u2019t talked to a doctor yet try acetaminophen instead. In moderation ofc~\n\nExplanation:\nI am currently going through something gastrointestinal related and need to see a doctor about it next week. It\u2019s most likely stomach ulcers/GERD or a mixture of both, possibly being made much worse by IBS\n\nI get \u201cgas pains\u201d like this very very often. They are intense, sometimes the acid reflux gas pain stuff is so bad I can\u2019t breathe and hyper ventilate and the pain doesn\u2019t go away for hours. I get attack after attack and it\u2019s horrible, my husband says my lips turn blue and I get super cold and clammy. Farting doesn\u2019t help, burping kind of does but the pain comes back quickly. Feel like I\u2019m dying\n\nWhen it first happened 2 years ago I was incorrectly told by a doctor they thought it was *panic attacks* and to take ibuprofen for the chest pain and I got a prescription for buspirone.\n\nSo here I am 2 years later and despite my daily anxiety being much better the pain from these attacks has gotten much worse. Guess what I was taking super regularly? Guess whats coincided directly with some of my worst attacks?\n\n\n1.\tIbuprofen \n2.\tfatty foods. Not like pork, more like oily peanut butter or actual butter, or anything that says \u201cfull fat\u201d absolutely kill me\n3.\tnot eating all day and having food with fat in it and taking an ibuprofen after dinner\n\nI\u2019ve completely stopped taking ibuprofen and even though fatty foods still anger my stomach I haven\u2019t had a single extremely painful attack since. Tele-doc said this definitely sounds more like stomach ulcers and similar acid related issues\n\nIt\u2019s very possible I\u2019ve fucked myself over with ulcers and gerd for the past 2 years because every time I\u2019d feel my chest get tight I\u2019d take some ibuprofen. Because I thought it was panic attacks I hadn\u2019t made the connection that certain foods were causing it (normal foods too, like certain bread or fish or peanut butter that I thought was perfectly healthy, had small amounts of in moderation). It\u2019s a wide range of food so it\u2019s been pretty difficult to narrow down what I can and can\u2019t eat cause it\u2019s not as simple as \u201cstay away from fried or greasy food\u201d. Yogurt, certain fish, certain foods with too much protein or fiber, my stomach literally can\u2019t handle digesting right now\n\n\nJust please please be careful guys. What I\u2019m going through sucks ass and even though ibuprofen was not the cause, it has definitely been a large contributor to to how bad it got. Now that I\u2019m not taking it I\u2019ve gotten much better",

These problems may develop at any time during treatment, may happen without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, or who drink three or more alcoholic drinks per day while taking ibuprofen.\u201d\n\nEdit: got a better first link!\n\nBasically ulcers can be formed by bacteria, taking NSAIDs can make them worse, which is what\u2019s happened in my case as what is actually ulcers/gerd was diagnosed as panic attacks and I took ibuprofen to manage the pain, actually making my situation worse\n\nNSAIDs can also cause ulcers and gastrointestinal problems and then continue to make them worse if you keep taking them",

She was a young lady from Thailand or something and was pretty stressed because she'd never traveled alone before, wasn't completely fluent in English, and had no idea how to navigate this situation. So I offered to let her tag along with me until we got back to the hotel. All the while, I had a terrible headache that I mentioned a few times. This girl reaches into her bag and offers me some medication - paracetamol. I politely decline because I had no idea what kind of weird foreign drugs this stranger was trying to offer me and wasn't feeling very adventurous. So I continued enjoying my excruciating headache until we made it to the hotel and I was *finally* able to get some Tylenol.",

I ended up needing to go home to my dad's because I was just devastatingly sick and living alone. We went to a doc and I got antibiotics and opiate pain meds. \n\nTo set the stage for the next three days: I wasn't eating for a couple days before the doc because it was too painful. Opiates also make me instantly and completely constipated. Like no movement going on down there. Antibiotics also turn my guts to muds and give me the worst watery diarrhea (as I learned during this story).\n\nI took the Vics first and then the antibiotics. And then started to feel better. This was a Sunday. By Wednesday the worst of it was over and I was happily off the pain meds because they make me feel weird and halfway through my antibiotics regimen. \n\nI realized at some point I was feeling worse and had shit since Sunday. Guts were bubbling but nothing was moving. I asked my dad to pick up prune juice at the store. He brought me a quart and without a thought I drank the whole thing. About an hour later I was on the toilet holding the walls and sweating as cramps gripped my guts. Stuff was happening.\n\nIt started with the biggest turd I've ever passed. It felt like a demon was slowly clawing its way out of my asshole. After a minute of this monster wrestling itself free it finally broke loose and landed with a solid plop. This was the opiate turd. It was followed by 20 high pressure squirts of diarrhea each shot punctuated as my upper guts refilled my lower guts so it could fire again. It splatter my legs , etc. \n\nFinally, if all stopped and I took a shower. I'll never forget my dad's face when I came out of the bathroom. We've laughed about facts all my life but it was all concern, \"you okay?\"\n\nI slept for like 12 hours after that only waking up eventually poop again...\n\nTldr: careful with opiates and antibiotics",

When chrones was ruled out, i was given a preliminary diagnosis of Gastric Lymphoma (my family had a history of pediatric cancer and apparently i had many signs and symptoms). They were 90% sure i was going to be a cancer patient \n\nThey decided to do a colonoscopy to confirm the diagnosis since i was so young they put me under for it. The conversatiom my family had with the doctor after i woke is now the stuff of legend.  \n\nHe said that he looked everywhere for the signs of the cancern when finally he felt alot of resitance on the scope. He pushed a little and felt the resistance give way. He then heard \"the loudest fart he has ever heard from either child or adult in his entire life\". \n\nI didnt have cancer...i had a fart trapped in my intestines that just couldnt get out due to chronic gastritis. \n\nAt the end of the day, after a week in the hospital the last few days i dont evem remember because they wouldn't feed me anything and i just slept most of the time. My family was just happy that i was okay.\n\n\nMoral of the story....dont worry about it. Shit happens \n\nTLDR: when i eas 12 the entire pediatric wing of the hospital thought i had cancer, but it turned oht to be mythically large fart",

It didn't get worse or better, but I got a sharp pain on my face so I went to the hospital. They decided the danger if appendicitis was bigger, ignored my face, made me wait hours for an ultrasound, more hours for a CT scan, had to explain to the CT technician that the bright thing in the image was a genital piercing, discovered I have a duplicated left ureter, and no appendicitis. They released me at 1am, no taxis wanted to accept the ride because gas prices are absurd and I live too close to the hospital, I had to call a cousin to save me with my phone at 2%, and the pain went away with a fart, too.",

In this case, it's clear that you've heard a bit about gender-neutral language and I hope you're interested in understanding more, rather than just dismissing it. I'm going to give a general explanation because I'm not sure what part of it confuses you, so apologies if some of this is unhelpful/you already know it.\r  \n\r  \nOP's partner is nonbinary (OP confirmed this in the comments) and uses they/them pronouns. If you've never met someone who uses they/them pronouns I'd encourage you to do some research, so that if you do meet someone you know how it works. Basically some people don't really feel like they fit into either the \"boy/man\" box or the \"girl/woman\" box, so people using either \"he\" or \"she\" to refer to them both make them uncomfortable, and they want to use another pronoun that's not explicitly gendered. (If you feel comfortable with the gender that you were assigned at birth, like I do, this can be hard to understand, but we just have to trust that each person understands themselves and their own feelings about gender -- doing research and hearing people talk about it might help.) The only gender-neutral third-person pronoun English has is \"they\" (besides \"it\", which most people don't want to be called for obvious reasons), and it has been used to refer to people of unknown gender for centuries. For example, you might say, \"Oh no, the person who was just sitting here left their coat behind!\" In recent years, more people have begun to use it to refer to themselves, as well as to people they don't know. These people, like OP's partner, might call themselves (gender) nonbinary, agender, gender nonconforming, genderqueer, or other labels, and they will often say that they \"use they/them pronouns\" when they introduce themselves. Some people also use other, newer, pronouns that are also gender-neutral.\r  \n\r  \nIf you have any more questions and you're not finding the answer on google, or you don't know what to search, feel free to PM me. I use she/her pronouns myself but I have many friends who use they/them or other pronouns, and know people of lots of different genders :)",

You might notice also that the gender-neutral word \"partner\" is used, instead of \"boyfriend\"/\"girlfriend\" or \"husband\"/\"wife\".\n\nEdit: OP has said in a comment further down that said partner is nonbinary, so the answer that they use they/them pronouns rather than that OP just didn't want to share their gender.\n\nEdit again: I wrote a much longer explanation to other people further down so if you don't know what I mean by \"they/them pronouns\" or \"nonbinary\" feel free to ask follow-up questions :)",

For example, I've seen it a lot and I didn't even really notice it in this story before I went down to the comments -- it didn't confuse me or detract from the story at all. Hopefully as it gets more common it'll stand out less and cause less confusion. \n\nAnd in this case, I really do think that the OP didn't have much of a choice in how they wrote it -- their partner is nonbinary, so I'm sure it would feel rude and even cruel to the OP for them to write about their partner using the wrong pronouns. It's a much more charged issue for someone who uses they/them pronouns than for someone who uses he/him or she/her, because I'm sure their partner has been misgendered constantly in real life and it's something that's important to them to get right.",

Yeah, I'm sorry about the downvotes -- there are a lot of people who deliberately pick fights on this topic by pretending they don't understand it, so people tend to assume the worst even when it's actually a genuine question.\n\nIt makes total sense though that you would be confused by it if English isn't your first language. Although \"they\" is primarily the third-person plural pronoun, it's actually used a lot in English as a third-person singular pronoun as well. Traditionally people use it when they don't know the gender of the person they're talking about -- for example, you might say, \"Oh no, someone left their coat behind after the party.\" It's clear in this case that it's one person, you just use \"their\" because it's gender-neutral, unlike \"his\" and \"her\", and you don't know the coat-owner's gender.\n\nIt's also becoming more and more common to use it for people who are non-binary -- so even if it's a friend (rather than someone you don't know), you might know that this person doesn't feel like either a man or a woman, so they have asked you to use the pronoun \"they\" when you talk about them. That's the case of OP's partner. If you've never met someone who uses that pronoun, it can be confusing at first, but just remember that it's the same \"singular they\" pronoun as I mentioned above, and hopefully it will make more sense.",

If I'm right, I'm very sorry for the downvotes and reddit's general tendency to downvote questions :(\n\nThere were only two people in the car: OP and OP's partner. OP's partner is nonbinary (OP confirmed this in the comments) and uses they/them pronouns. If you've never met someone who uses they/them pronouns I'd encourage you to do some research, so that if you do meet someone you know how it works. Basically some people don't really feel like they fit into either the \"boy/man\" box or the \"girl/woman\" box, so people using either \"he\" or \"she\" to refer to them both make them uncomfortable, and they want to use another pronoun that's not explicitly gendered. (If you feel comfortable with the gender that you were assigned at birth, like I do, this can be hard to understand, but we just have to trust that each person understands themselves and their own feelings about gender -- doing research and hearing people talk about it might help.) The only gender-neutral third-person pronoun English has is \"they\" (besides \"it\", which most people don't want to be called for obvious reasons), and it has been used to refer to people of unknown gender for centuries. For example, you might say, \"Oh no, the person who was just sitting here left their coat behind!\" In recent years, more people have begun to use it to refer to themselves, as well as to people they don't know. These people, like OP's partner, might call themselves (gender) nonbinary, agender, gender nonconforming, genderqueer, or other labels, and they will often say that they \"use they/them pronouns\" when they introduce themselves. Some people also use other, newer, pronouns that are also gender-neutral.\n\nIf you have any more questions and you're not finding the answer on google, or you don't know what to search, feel free to PM me. I use she/her pronouns myself but I have many friends who use they/them or other pronouns, and know people of lots of different genders :)",

I can guarantee it because if you speak English, there are many common situations where they/them is used in the singular.\n\nThe only reason you're pretending to be confused is because in the story, you inferred that OP's partner is male and think OP should be using he/him pronouns. Biologically, it does sound like they are male but if OP's partner doesn't want to be identified as a man with he/him pronouns, then OP is simply respecting their partner's wishes by not referring to them as such. It's only complicated if you want it to be.",

It's often more likely that someone's trying to stir the pot than that they actually have never encountered someone using singular \"they\", especially if they spend time on the internet. I try to give people the benefit of the doubt in my responses but it's easy to get tired after a while. And, of course, downvoting people for not having heard of something/asking questions about it is peak reddit, on a variety of topics, unfortunately :)\n\n(Also just a note that this actually does have to do with singular \"they\". Saying someone is nonbinary just means that they don't fit into the gender binary, and someone like that using they/them pronouns is an example of singular \"they\" just like using it for someone with unknown gender is.)",

I wish people would do that more often -- I think using they/them all the time unless it's relevant or you're talking about someone the listener also knows who uses she or him would do a lot towards getting people used to it. But I digress.\n\nI'd encourage you to look more into the differences between gender and biological sex, and even the many different things that make up biological sex (it's so far from just chromosomes or just genitalia, and there aren't just two biological sexes, let alone just two genders). I think it's really interesting to learn more about.

Why would I not?\n\nAnd you DO call your sibling \u201cthey\u201d if they\u2019re non-binary. And I, honestly, do not get the confusion at all. The context pretty clearly tells us that the people present are OP and their partner, so any confusion seems completely dishonest - to me at least. And yes, some people may be confused and some people may not have English as their first language (me included), but there are way more tactful ways of clearing up any confusion you may have.\n\nOf course I wouldn\u2019t normally refer to my cis-gendered sister as \u201cthey\u201d. She\u2019s completely fine with being called \u201cshe\u201d, so that\u2019s what I do. Same with my brother. If my sibling was non-binary I would definitely call them \u201cthey\u201d (or whatever they told me to call them).\n\nWhether you know someone or not isn\u2019t what defines if you refer to them by gendered or neutral pronouns. What defines your use of pronouns is what you\u2019re asked to use by the person you\u2019re referring to. \n\nAnd yes, the specific use of \u201cthey/them\u201d singular as a neutral pronoun for identified people may seem new, but the logic still stands (in my opinion) - you use they/them when you can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re talking about a \u201che\u201d or a \u201cshe\u201d. Whether that\u2019s because you don\u2019t know the person or because that person doesn\u2019t fit into the \u201che/she\u201d binary system shouldn\u2019t really matter, should it?\n\n\nI\u2019ve read comments on this post giving OP \u201cpermission\u201d to use gendered pronouns, telling OP that it doesn\u2019t matter to \u201cus\u201d. I\u2019ve read comments ridiculing and judging OP for using neutral pronouns and I\u2019ve read a lot of comments that seem to come from a bad faith standpoint (especially when seeing the commenters other posts/comments). This isn\u2019t a new concept, we\u2019ve all had well over half a century to wrap our minds around \u201cthey/them\u201d being used as a singular, gender neutral pronoun. There are plenty of resources online and in print talking about this.",

If I'm right, I'm very sorry for the downvotes and reddit's general tendency to downvote questions :(\r  \n\r  \nOP's partner is nonbinary (OP confirmed this in the comments) and uses they/them pronouns. If you've never met someone who uses they/them pronouns I'd encourage you to do some research, so that if you do meet someone you know how it works. Basically some people don't really feel like they fit into either the \"boy/man\" box or the \"girl/woman\" box, so people using either \"he\" or \"she\" to refer to them feels wrong and uncomfortable, and they want to use another pronoun that's not explicitly gendered. (If you feel comfortable with the gender that you were assigned at birth, like I do, this can be hard to understand, but we just have to trust that each person understands themselves and their own feelings about gender -- doing research and hearing people talk about it might help.) The only gender-neutral third-person pronoun English has is \"they\" (besides \"it\", which most people don't want to be called for obvious reasons), and it has been used to refer to people of unknown gender for centuries. For example, you might say, \"Oh no, the person who was just sitting here left their coat behind!\" In recent years, more people have begun to use it to refer to themselves, as well as to people they don't know. These people, like OP's partner, might call themselves (gender) nonbinary, agender, gender nonconforming, genderqueer, or other labels, and they will often say that they \"use they/them pronouns\" when they introduce themselves. Some people also use other, newer, pronouns that are also gender-neutral.\r  \n\r  \nIf you have any more questions and you're not finding the answer on google, or you don't know what to search, feel free to PM me. I use she/her pronouns myself but I have many friends who use they/them or other pronouns, and know people of lots of different genders :)",

Why do people have the need to feel different   in such a logical argument that has predecided features .\n\n\n\n\"Have you seen Dave?\n\n\"Yeah, he went that way\".\n \nFixed .\n\nThat's my opinion.

Even if you wouldn't use \"they\" in this particular instance, I think if you listen you'll find that many people do (and have for a long time), and you might even do it in other situations. \n\nRegardless, people have been using it for people they don't know for a long time, and recently more people are also using it as an alternative to \"he\" and \"she\" for people who don't feel comfortable with either of those. A lot of people don't fit into either the \"boy/man\" or \"girl/woman\" boxes, and so when people use \"he\" or \"she\" for them it feels uncomfortable and wrong. This can be hard to understand for people like us, who do, but we just have to trust that everyone has different experiences of gender and for some people, like OP's partner, \"he\" or \"she\" just doesn't fit. It might help to do some more research on this if you want to understand it better, and feel free to PM me if you have questions or don't know how to research it :)",

The verbs right after singular \"they\" are still conjugated in the plural (as far as I know it's always been used with plural verbs historically). So you would say, \"I have a nonbinary friend named Em -- they are really cool!\" But as you saw in the earlier reply, if the verb isn't directly after the pronoun \"they\", people tend to go back to the singular forms. It's obviously not a 100% satisfying solution but it's the one we've adopted. It does get easier to navigate with time. For example, I've seen it a lot and I didn't even really notice it in this story before I went down to the comments -- it didn't confuse me or detract from the story at all, nor did I have to think twice while reading comments. Hopefully as it gets more common it'll stand out less and cause less confusion.\n\nAnd in this case, I really do think that the OP didn't have much of a choice in how they wrote it -- their partner is nonbinary, so I'm sure it would feel rude and even cruel to the OP for them to write about their partner using the wrong pronouns. It's a much more charged issue for someone who uses they/them pronouns than for someone who uses he/him or she/her, because I'm sure their partner has been misgendered constantly in real life and it's something that's important to them to get right.",

I can honestly tell you that I was not at all confused. If you read/hear more things with singular they in, it might help you get more comfortable with it. As a gentle reminder, while using singular they for nonbinary and other gender-nonconforming people is currently gaining ground, as a general concept it is centuries old. I can almost guarantee that you have used singular they before, and even if not I'm sure you will hear it if you listen.

If I'm right, I'm very sorry for the downvotes and reddit's general tendency to downvote questions :(\r  \n\r  \nThere are only two people in this story: OP and OP's partner. OP's partner is nonbinary (OP confirmed this in the comments) and uses they/them pronouns. If you've never met someone who uses they/them pronouns I'd encourage you to do some research, so that if you do meet someone you know how it works. Basically some people don't really feel like they fit into either the \"boy/man\" box or the \"girl/woman\" box, so people using either \"he\" or \"she\" to refer to them both make them uncomfortable, and they want to use another pronoun that's not explicitly gendered. (If you feel comfortable with the gender that you were assigned at birth, like I do, this can be hard to understand, but we just have to trust that each person understands themselves and their own feelings about gender -- doing research and hearing people talk about it might help.) The only gender-neutral third-person pronoun English has is \"they\" (besides \"it\", which most people don't want to be called for obvious reasons), and it has been used to refer to people of unknown gender for centuries. For example, you might say, \"Oh no, the person who was just sitting here left their coat behind!\" In recent years, more people have begun to use it to refer to themselves, as well as to people they don't know. These people, like OP's partner, might call themselves (gender) nonbinary, agender, gender nonconforming, genderqueer, or other labels, and they will often say that they \"use they/them pronouns\" when they introduce themselves. Some people also use other, newer, pronouns that are also gender-neutral.\r  \n\r  \nIf you have any more questions and you're not finding the answer on google, or you don't know what to search, feel free to PM me. I use she/her pronouns myself but I have many friends who use they/them or other pronouns, and know people of lots of different genders :)",

It's like it came loose and moved into a position in my guts to stab me. I walked out of there a new man. I sat down and ate my food that was gonna get boxed up. I have no idea why I felt it in my stomach and not my intestines. Every few years I get a lighter version of that feeling but always know what to do now.",

So we could only have 2 tablets every 4 hours- you say you had 4. \nSo I just wanted to say not to overdose on this stuff, everyone thinks acetaminophen/ paracetamol is harmless so they pop extra tablets , but it's not, it can fuck up your liver if you keep taking too much of it. \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol_poisoning#:~:text=Studies%20have%20shown%20significant%20hepatotoxicity,kg%20could%20potentially%20cause%20toxicity.\n\n\nThis website (amongst many others) says that it's safe to take the normal dose of paracetamol along with a non-paracetamol pain killer like ibuprofen- you could do that for severe pain rather than overdose paracetamol https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/paracetamol-for-adults/#:~:text=5.,other%20medicines%20that%20contain%20paracetamol.\n\nNow you know that pain could be caused by a trapped fart, try some \"digestion yoga\" or \"fart yoga\" on youtube- it'll help get it out. I mean of course if you don't know what the pain is you'd likely want to seek medical help just in case it actually is a serious problem, but while waiting for that help to arrive you can try the yoga",

It would for 325mg or 500mg tablet if taken in under 4 hours.\n\nYou should be careful because overdose can cause liver damage. A one off isn't likely to kill you, but you don't want to do it regularly.\n\nIf you need extra pain relief then alternating with an NSAID like aspirin or ibuprofen is safer option IE take acetaminophen at recommended dosage, then 2-3 hours later take ibuprofen, then 2-3 hours later take acetaminophen etc. That way both have the 4-6 hour interval but you are getting double pain killer.\n\nAnd if pain persists see a doctor etc etc",

The maximum dose for Tylenol / acetaminophen / paracetamol is very close to the threshold for a dangerous dose.\n\n**Taking more than the recommended dose of Tylenol *just one time* can cause liver failure and death.**\n[A research article from 2006](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16294364/) found that in the US, Tylenol overdoses led to around 56,000 ER visits per year. 458 overdoses led to death. *100 of those 458 fatalities were unintentional.* \n\n[Another study from 2016](https://www.healthline.com/health/can-tylenol-kill-you#overdose-dangers) found that liver failure caused by Tylenol overdoses resulted in death 28% of the time. 29% of the people in liver failure needed a transplant. Many of those that got off \"lucky,\" as in they survived and didn't need a transplant, still had permanent damage to their livers.\n\nJust because a medicine is sold OTC doesn't mean it is \"safe.\" You still have to follow the directions to use the medicine safely.

Sat there for another couple of minutes and the pain just kept getting worse, and all of a sudden my vision started getting spotty... A minute later I wake up head down on the desk with the rest of the class staring at me. Nurse for the school came and hauled me off to the nurses office, and I'm still feeling pretty crappy, but then I get the most intense feeling of needing to shit, so I shuffled my ass to the restroom and destroyed that poor toilet...

If I'm right, I'm very sorry for the downvotes and reddit's general tendency to downvote questions. I'm going to give a general explanation because I'm not sure of the exact source of your confusion -- feel free to ask follow-up questions if I don't address why you were actually confused.\r  \n\r  \n\"They\" is OP's partner. OP's partner is nonbinary (OP confirmed this in the comments) and uses they/them pronouns. If you've never met someone who uses they/them pronouns I'd encourage you to do some research, so that if you do meet someone you know how it works. Basically some people don't really feel like they fit into either the \"boy/man\" box or the \"girl/woman\" box, so people using either \"he\" or \"she\" to refer to them both make them uncomfortable, and they want to use another pronoun that's not explicitly gendered. (If you feel comfortable with the gender that you were assigned at birth, like I do, this can be hard to understand, but we just have to trust that each person understands themselves and their own feelings about gender -- doing research and hearing people talk about it might help.) The only gender-neutral third-person pronoun English has is \"they\" (besides \"it\", which most people don't want to be called for obvious reasons), and it has been used to refer to people of unknown gender for centuries. For example, you might say, \"Oh no, the person who was just sitting here left their coat behind!\" In recent years, more people have begun to use it to refer to themselves, as well as to people they don't know. These people, like OP's partner, might call themselves (gender) nonbinary, agender, gender nonconforming, genderqueer, or other labels, and they will often say that they \"use they/them pronouns\" when they introduce themselves. Some people also use other, newer, pronouns that are also gender-neutral.\r  \n\r  \nIf you have any more questions and you're not finding the answer on google, or you don't know what to search, feel free to PM me. I use she/her pronouns myself but I have many friends who use they/them or other pronouns, and know people of lots of different genders :)",
