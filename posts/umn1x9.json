Any deity that bestows the rights listed in the Constitution would be consistent with the USA as founded. \n\nAnyone who agrees that those rights are sacrosanct for any reason benefits from living under those protections, and they are welcome to pursue amending the Constitution if they think more or fewer listed rights are appropriate. Your reference to the treatment of women is a perfect example, please see the 19th Amendment.\n\nNot sure why you mentioned abortion, it's not in the Construction, and almost always requires the labor of another to carry out. Food, clothing and shelter are also not inalienable rights for that same reason.\n\nTo eat pork or not eat pork or wear a bikini or not is irrelevant to the discussion. Any religion that an individual chooses to follow or not follow is protected under the 1st Amendment. If that is morally repugnant to some, they are free to live in a community that shares their views or to decide that they prefer another country that more closely matches their values and desires.\n\nI understand that the idea that God exists, yet still allows free will is very disquieting to many people. And yes, there is definitely no consensus on the scope and totality of His nature or what pleases or displeases Him.\n\nBut that's the beauty of the Constitution. It captures the parts of that scope that allows for a peaceful, productive, and moral society. It will never be perfect, but there is a simple mechanism to pursue a more perfect Union.",

                      "text": "That's a rather militant view.....\n\nThere's a large gulf between separating church and state and outright banning faith on government property.   Americans have a right to self-expression, regardless of where that expression takes place.\n\nIt's people with your flawed viewpoint that are forcing statues and monuments featuring Moses, the 10 Commandments, the Hammurabic Code, etc., being torn down and removed from any public place, and that's just not feasible.\n\nCan you not see that having a quote from Hammurabi or King Solomon on the wall in a police station or a courthouse is not religion, but history?  It's the history of the system of laws that this country was founded upon.\n\nIt's funny....  My nephew is a young man of very strong faith.   I too am a man of faith, but I tend to keep it to myself unless I'm sure I'm in like-minded company (like in church).  Well, one day, my nephew decides that, right after the Pledge of Allegiance (which was voluntary at his school) he decided to recite the Lord's Prayer (you know, the \"Our Father...\" one) loud enough that most of the class heard him.  He got sent to the office and was actually suspended for a day.  I refused to allow him to be punished for that.  I decided to take that day off from work and we went on a whale watch, drove some go carts, I bought him some new Jordan's, took him and two of his best friends to dinner at their favorite place,  etc.   Well, just a couple of months later, it's 4th period, almost the end of the school day.  But it's also sundown in New England in winter.  So this Muslim student put on his prayer hat (Taqiyah) and took out his little rug (Sajj\u0101da),  and proceeded to do his whole prayer routine, including the \"Allah Hu Akbar\", the terrible singing and all that.   Scared a few of the kids right out of the room.  But they did nothing to this young man.  Not a damned thing!   Not a detention, not a day's suspension, not a demerit in his file, nothing.   That is BULLSHIT!!  Not only did I ream the principal, I also threatened to sue.   The next morning the Superintendent of Schools issued a statement affirming the right of any student to pray in school or in class if they felt that they needed to.   Awww....  Wasn't that sweet of them?   They also called a meeting for me and my nephew with the Principal where in he apologized to my nephew profusely.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but if you want to get anything done in this society, you're going to have to threaten a few bureaucrats with some due diligence.  That's just a fact of life!\n\nBut, going back to what you were saying, the top of the Supreme Court Building in our nation's capital has 18 figures carved into it, along with the inscription \"Equal Justice Under The Law\" - which I hope we start practicing any day now.  But many of those 18 figures, each of them made of Spanish marble, each standing approximately 7'2\" tall and looking down on the SCOTUS judges from 30 feet up, are effigies of the following people:\n\n* Moses (from the Old Testament) \n* Confucius (father of a religion that is big in China, and one of the few religions that isn't outlawed by the Chinese Communist Party) \n* King Solomon (the Son of David, the second King of Israel, builder of the First Temple and author of the poems in the Book of Psalms, The Song of Solomon and the wisest king of all time)\n*  Hammurabi (a Babylonian King who was considered a living diety)\n* Darius the Great of Persia (also considered a Good-king)\n\nBut those people are up there not as religious figures.   Not at all.   They are there as famous lawgivers!\n\nIn fact, they're joined by Chief Justice Taft (pictured as a youth), Secretary of State Elihu Root, Cass Gilbert (the building's architect), Chief Justice Hughes, Aitken (the sculptor), Chief Justice Marshall as a young man, etc.\n\nThen, when you walk into the building via the front entrance, you walk through monumental bronze doors at the top of the front steps.  Those doors weigh six and one-half tons EACH  (that's 13,000 pounds). \u00a0The doors' panels, sculpted by John Donnelly, Jr., depict the trial scene from the Shield of Achilles (as described in \"The Iliad\"), a Roman Praetor publishing an edict, Julian and a pupil, Emperor Justinian of Byzantium publishing the \"Corpus Juris\"; King John of England sealing the \"Magna Carta\", the Chancellor of Parliament publishing the first \"Statute of Westminster\", Napoleon Bonaparte writing the \"Napoleonic Code\" and Lord Coke barring King James from sitting as a Judge.  These scenes aren't religious in nature, unless you're a pagan Greek (meaning the Achilles one), but they are all important moments in the evolution of the rule of law.\n\nAs such, none of them is any more or less \"religious\" than any other.   All were lawgivers, some of them giving the actual law(s) that they're famous for.   The religious status of any of them is completely irrelevant.",

They're like the time-share salesmen that force you to listen to their pitch before letting you get on with your life. The people on the ground usually think they're actually helping the people and 'saving their souls' at the same time. The people at the top, however, just want to expand the flock to rake in more donations if these poor fuckers ever get on their feet.",

It's funny, if I were going to pursue involvement in a faith, Christianity wiuld be last in line because of its insistence on proselytizing and condemning other faiths.

It's not so much about Christianity or nothing, and more about being all in as a christian, not wavering. Years ago I visited a Buddhist monastery and the first guy I talked to said, essentially, Buddhism is good, other approaches are good,the problem is more bouncing around and not committing, because every faith would challenge you deeply at some point, and that's when you bounce to the next flavor, so no personal work gets done. But so many Christians seem to make believing in jesus the main thing. Like, \"I believe that believing is the only valid belief.\"  It's so idolatrous, lol.",

They want everyone without the money to own a house living in the also overly expensive \"luxury\" apartments that the city gets a kickback from. They want to force poorer renters into Missouri or Wyandotte.",

Truman lost Kansas in 1948 and he was from KCMO area.  Governors are different there, and it's not a popular vote thing, otherwise we would see more variance in presidential elections.",

Furthermore, given the historical context around the origins of its use in the United States it is clearly intended as a reference to the Christian god and is biased in favor of that religion in particular.\"",

The new BSL-4 facility in Manhattan, NBAF, is a good example. I guess what I'm trying to get at is that through my travels across the country, people are people.

That means out of everyone in the state, nearly half voted Democrat.\n\nIf you asked anyone that didn't live here what the population was like they probably think nearly everyone is republican, Christian conservative when that's really not the case.

Awful wind the whole way with 70mph+ gusts. Very nerve wracking.\n\nWe just thought it was windy but as the sun set, we began to see dust clouds and a storm on the horizon. My girlfriend had been driving for a bit and blurts out, \"Are we driving into some tornado shit!?\"\n\nWe laughed. Later in the evening and I finally convinced her we need to pull over and wait out the storm. We park in a stripped out abandoned gas station, get frisky and then lay down to watch the storm. Positively giddy until her phone beeps and warns us of the two tornadoes that had formed north and south of us. \n\nAll of the air seemed to suddenly get sucked out of the atmosphere. We had nowhere to go. I thought, oh fuck, we are literally going to die here. After some tense discussion as to what we should do, we agree to press forward west to Colorado.\n\nAs luck would have it the tornadoes both traveled to the east of us. Minutes after crossing the state border and the wind began to die down. We slept soundly at the reservoir that night. \n\nDorothy had it twisted. Kansas is a dangerous place.",

People are pissed about the pool, and they're pissed about this because the commission didn't post an agenda of what would be discussed like they should be doing. They're using it, from what I've seen and heard, as a catalyst to get involved in local government and advocate for more transparency, which is actually really cool to see. In God We Trust never should've been normalized, anyways, and a lot of these people that I know are upset about it being removed, but it's always great to see more people getting involved in local politics.",

That makes it unfair for other religions. \n\nYou'll also see this argument when Christians try to put statues and 10 commandments up in public places such as schools. These are usually taken down once people start requesting Muslims or the Satanic Temple icons and teachings.\n\nTake the article below for example. After they started saying Christian prayer at a local government meeting the Satanic Temple fought for their prayer to be said as well. However, the government only said the prayer once and then it was banned. That is a prime example of the problem this poses. \n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hail-satan-prayer-protest-alaska-kenai-peninsula-satanic-temple-a8968581.html",

(a few gram)  Buyers more and more want to pay electronically and the coffeeshops accommodate that. However, the GROWING of cannabis is still illegal (welcome to the Dutch policies) so the shops cannot legally buy their products. They have to buy it from homegrowers or professional criminals and the government allows this.  (yes, we are crazy) and obviously they have to use cash to pay for it.  So they get a large share of their income digitally,  and they have to go to the bank and take it out in paper money to pay the supplier.   But now the banks have more strict rules about cash money, to counter money laundering and terrorists. Any client with 'unusual'  behaviour is getting scrutinized in detail.    So the bank is asking a lot of questions  (ordered by law) but the marihuana shop can't answer all those questions  because some of them involve their illegal supply chain , (but remember that illegal supply chain is part of our governments policy and is officially permitted)  \nSo the bank says, sorry we can't give you a business account.\nand now the coffeeshop has to go to court to ask the judge to force banks giving them an account, so they can draw cash to pay their shady suppliers......",

You aren't an atheist yourself, and most religious people were raised with religion, so it's statistically a little unlikely that you've had the experience of having been one in the past.\n\n\nAnd that's okay, but the reason it's so easy for you to make this statement is because you probably see atheism as less legitimate than religion. Religion is something to be taken seriously and respected; atheism is not. We are not on equal footing. \n\n\nAnd I mean, I kinda get it. As a religious person, how do you take the absence of belief seriously? You probably imagine taking all of the faith and devotion you feel, and directing it towards a vacuum, and that seems silly. It's much harder to imagine yourself *genuinely just not believing* in something you hold dear. \n\n\nOn an individual level, this doesn't bug me. I don't even have to brush it off as silly. We're allowed to believe different things. If you were standing in front of me, I wouldn't be trying to talk you out of your faith - unless you wanted to talk me out of my lack thereof. But it's the institutional stuff that bugs me. \n\n\nIn disputes about factual issues, like, say, whether evolution is real, how old the earth is, etc, it's entirely easy for religious people to be taken seriously on the sheer weight of belief. Atheists don't have that luxury. We don't get to say \"I just feel very strongly that evolution is real\". Atheistic beliefs are held to a standard of evidence that religious beliefs are not, but it doesn't really matter because no amount of evidence can effectively argue against a faith-based stance. \n\n\nSo \"in god we trust\" is a constant reminder that I have to play by your rules, but you don't really have to play by mine. I never get to make the argument that \"I just believe this really hard\". \n\n\n\n> I believe the word \"god\" in that sense refers to the being or entity responsible for our existence, which you obviously think is absurd \n\n\n\nI don't think it's absurd, I just don't think there *is* a being or entity, so that's kind of a meaningless statement to me. I'm an equal opportunity atheist. All the gods of all the world's history, christian or otherwise, carry equally little weight with me. I'm not mad at Christian God, I just don't believe in gods, they don't make sense and you can't prove they're there, so there's no argument you can make for them that isn't based on faith. That just isn't enough for me. \n\n\nI also want to point out that if your argument is \"this is okay because this word doesn't mean what the definition of the word is\", that doesn't hold much water\n\n\nThanks for engaging in this with me. I don't think we'll change each other's minds but I appreciate you not trying to convert me or tell me I'm going to hell or whatever.",
