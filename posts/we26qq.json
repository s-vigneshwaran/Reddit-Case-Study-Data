      "text": "Who thinks this?\n\nThe guy on the left who I will call Olly looks the most uncomfortable and is def the least attractive. His smile is almost close mouth rictus. I wonder if this lot are British based just on his smile.\n\nI think Olly thinks he\u2019s into the girl but he\u2019s def in the friend zone with her and she sees him as a \u201cbest friend\u201d because she\u2019s slightly more attractive than him.\n\nThe girl, who I will name Emily, seems comfortable-ish as the only one with a relaxed face but her arms are pulling away from the guys suggesting otherwise. She is wearing a relaxed but kinda revealing outfit. More power to ya\u2019. But this suggests she feels comfortable around these guys and they\u2019re not a threat but then also not seemingly a love interest.\n\nI don\u2019t know what Emily\u2019s doing but girls generally like to look good and def around guys they like. Emily doesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s making an effort here. Her body language suggests she\u2019s more comfortable with Olly but that she\u2019s not into him. I think he\u2019s closer to her because he wants to be but it\u2019s not reciprocated. \n\nThe guy on the right, who I\u2019m calling Sebastian, is technically the only half attractive one and obviously Olly is into him but just won\u2019t admit it to himself. His hand is kinda around Emily but outstretched to Sebastian suggesting that\u2019s who he craves to touch. It may be love or maybe he just never had a male friend until his late 30\u2019s.\n\nOlly doesn\u2019t feel comfortable platonically fully hugging Emily. If they were together he would hug her no probs. Or if he was genuinely just her friend she\u2019d be more akin to a sister and he\u2019d have his arm properly around her.\n\nSebastian seems the most relaxed but then he doesn\u2019t appear to be touching either of the other two. He has the most uncomfortable rictus grin. I feel there\u2019s distance between him and the other two. \n\nWhat\u2019s his left hand doing? If he felt comfortable with them his left arm would\u2019ve been on the back of the couch all hugging together. I don\u2019t really know what Sebastians deal is but it\u2019s such fun when you\u2019re so repressed you can\u2019t even hug your friends. \n\nI think maybe Emily likes or had a thing for Sebastian or vice versa. Either way they\u2019ve definitely thought about it. He\u2019s a guy so with a girl in a top like that he\u2019s definitely thought about it. Girls always decide in the first millisecond if there\u2019s any chance they\u2019d doof you.\n\nI just get the feeling she hasn\u2019t ruled out Sebastian just yet. Not too sure but there\u2019s definitely some distance or something there. Maybe it\u2019s just the two on the left are closer or have known each other longer. But then why aren\u2019t they hugging properly either?\n\nEither way I\u2019m looking forward to all the r/relationshipadvice we\u2019ll get out of this car crash when it all falls apart.\n\nI\u2019m predicting Olly confesses his love to Emily and the friend group all falls apart. Sebastian will have to choose Olly as per the code and Olly will just head into his next unrequited love friend zone relationship.\n\nEmily and Sebastian never getting to explore their feelings or their weird shaped bodies. So sad. Could easily be avoided. Go take some Molly together you\u2019ll work it out. I\u2019m rooting for the Semily!l",

It appears not.\n\nWhat's this? Two males have taken notice of the desperate female and begin to make their move. The female will attempt to friend zone the potential mates, her naturally engrained daddy issues take over - an ancient defense mechanism used exclusively by the homo bonerkiller.\n\nIt appears like she does not select a mate, instead choosing to form a parasitical relationship known as \"just friends\" where the female relies on the males for emotional support while leveraging the two males against each other. For now she will take advantage of the gullible males, until the opportunity arises for her to lay her eggs in the males chest cavity and continue the beautiful circle of life.",
