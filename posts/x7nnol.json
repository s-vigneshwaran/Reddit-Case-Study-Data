  "text": "TIFU by taking my friend's fiance out for a drink.\nThis happened 2 weeks ago:\nI (f) met my friend's (m) fiance a couple of months ago when he moved with her back to his home town. The fiance and I got on well enough and we tentatively started to form a friendship.\nThe night before their wedding, my friend stayed over at his brother's. \nI stayed the night at their house with the bride. She had no friends or family in town and I was by default the bridesmaid.\nFeeling kind of sorry for her for not having had a Bachelorette party or anyone around, I suggested that we go out to have a few drinks, celebrate her last few hours of singlehood. \nShe agreed. I ordered a beer and a tequila each for the first round, thinking that we'd start with a shooter, have a few beers and end off with a shooter, nothing wild. I didn't want to be the cause of a severely hungover bride.\nAfter the first tequila hit her stomach, she changed, became more animated, I put it down to just pre-wedding excitement.\nNo one told me that she was a recovering addict who hasn't had a drink in 4 years. No one. \nIn the past when I visited, my friend and myself would drink beer and she wouldn't, I always thought that it was because she wasn't particularly fond of beer or alcohol. I have lots of girl friends like that, who will only drink on certain occasions.\nBut I like beer - (the Hon. Brett Kavanaugh)\n\nThe bride started chugging beers and shooters like a fratboy. I tried to stop her, she wouldn't listen to reason. She became more and more aggressive, so I just backed off. Had I known then what I know now, I would've made a bigger effort, even if that may have meant a black eye or bloody nose for me.\n\nAs Murphy would have it, she chose the exact moment to go to the restroom as a girl who was doing lines in the stall next to hers. The bride asked and got given. Anything for the Bride, right? 'Oh my gawd, oh wonderful, you're getting married tomorrow, here's another'\nThe night went downhill from there. She was like a freight train, with me barely hanging on.\nShe phoned her husband-to-be and told him that the wedding was off, that she's changed her mind.\nI felt like dog-shit.\n\nI eventually managed to get her home at around 04h00. He was waiting for her. She screamed at him and he shouted at me. \nThey postponed the wedding.\n\nI feel so, so bad.  I never wanted to cause shit for either one of them.\n\nTL;DR I took my friend's fiance out for a drink the night before their wedding, thinking I was doing a nice thing. Didn't realize that she was a recovering addict and the wedding got postponed.",

People you love can always change, and the longer you stay in a marriage and do things like buying a house and having kids, the more complex it becomes to leave if necessary.\n\nIt sounds like an irrational fear, but the brain tends to give a lot of bandwidth to \"what ifs\", no matter how unlikely, as a defense mechanism.",

You'd then have to spend time finding somewhere else to live, figure out who keeps what if you bought something together, move your stuff to your new place, etc.\n\nThat was my original point, your lives are already intertwined.

You can work things out on your own, and you are not obligated to combine finances if you don't want to before getting married. Once you get married and things go south, it becomes harder.\n\nThe other problem is that divorce is still highly stigmatized in society despite how common it is. We tend to subconsciously view divorced people as being broken or bad at relationships unless they were a victim of cheating/abuse.",

Buy me a few apps or buy all my sodas? Asking the bartender (this one is hard to find) to make a fancy non-alcoholic cocktail. I did it once and it was delicious!

Even though it\u2019s the truth, I let it out with a laugh, \u201cno, but thank you. I\u2019m in Recovery. One drink will turn into my ass waking up in jail tomorrow. Haha!\u201d\n\nIf she was willing to accept an invitation to go for a drink, and did not tell you she\u2019s a person in Recovery, that\u2019s is 100% on her. She saw an opportunity to go drink with somebody who didn\u2019t know she shouldn\u2019t be drinking, and convinced herself it was just gonna be a few drinks, be fun, and it was a secret nobody would ever know about. Then she did what alcoholics do and went off the rails. \u201cOne is too many, and a thousand is never enough.\u201d She knew exactly what she was doing.\n\nThey didn\u2019t even warn you she was in Recovery. That\u2019s a fuck up on their end, and something her addict brain convinced her she could \u201cget away with.\u201d (I say this without malice towards her. It\u2019s tough, as an addict/alcoholic when your own mind is working against you. It\u2019s incredibly difficult. But, as others have said, the relapse generally happens mentally long before it physically takes place. She knew exactly what she was doing, and it\u2019s shitty that she pegged you as a scapegoat.) As a general rule, even the nicest of us addicts/alcoholics, for lack of a better phrase, really suck ass when we use. \n\nI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t write you a better, more encouraging and detailed response, but it\u2019s past 3 AM and I\u2019m fucking tired. Last thread before bed!\n\nTL;DR - Coming from an alcoholic/addict in long-term Recovery, this is so completely NOT your fault and NOT your fuck up. Don\u2019t even entertain the idea of blaming yourself here. You did nothing wrong!",

She will disappear for a few days until you get the call from a hospital.\n\nHer last relapse put her in a coma for almost two days. She is now 3 months sober and doing very well. Im not going to leave her because of how she acts when drinking because i know that is not her. But there's also not a whole lot i can do if she doesn't want to help herself.

And the urge never really goes away. It may become dormant so people think - 'hey one drink won't hurt me', but it also can come back in most unexpected moments.\n\nIt's an illness that's never really cured.\n\nFWIW I am not an alcoholic but two of my uncles were (as well as one of their partner and some of their children now; one of the uncles recovered, second never did). It's a vicious, vicious thing, addiction, and it's not something that goes away, it's something you have to live with unfortunately.\n\nEdit: i actually read now that for some people craving alcohol stops after years of not drinking, but for some they don't.

Gangs and criminals use it to rob people they blow it in someone's face and (if they don't die) they wake up the next day in an empty house with an empty bank account and no memory of what happened.  They then find out from neighbors and/or the bank that they themselves packed all of there stuff in a van and they themselves closed out their bank accounts. \n\nIt's called the Devils Breath on the streets . I have only seen two actual news reports on it . One was from vice back when they were pretty new and I think dateline or one if those had a story where it was used. \n\nBut I assume with all the MK Ultra and project Monarch what have you where the C.I.A. was surching for a drug like this that they know all about it and use it if need be.\n\nHaiti has similar using blowfish but it just zombiefy's you and or kills you. Ask Bill Pullman on that one . During filming of Serpent and the rainbow in Haiti . Pullman told the Oungan ( Voodoo Priest) who was consulting on the film that he wished he could have an authentic voodoo experience.  The man laughed blew powder in his face ( just like in the movie) and Bill Pullman woke up in a Miami hotel a week later with no clue what. How, when or where he was. I think the interview is on the special features of the dvd.  The director said they shut down filming and brought Pullman back to U.S. for safety and the doctors if I remember that part right .",

Sorry about that. \n\n\nWhat I mean is, that TO SOMEONE WHO IS NOT AFFECTED SO MUCH BY ALCOHOL, which is most people ever as far as I\u2019m aware, it is very easy to be unaware of, or even *not believe when told about* the dangers. \n\nLike, yes, someone who continues to insist you drink, after you make it clear you don\u2019t want to, is a jerk. But that\u2019s just not the same as being malicious or evil. \n\nI love reading. I can\u2019t understand how someone could read a book that suits their tastes and *not* enjoy it. But many of my friends literally refuse to read. It\u2019s never, ever, going to happen.\n\nSo to them, I\u2019m a good reader who enjoys reading, but asks them every once in a while if they\u2019d want to give (insert book) a try. \n\nNow, if books were addictive poison, then it would be a jerk move of me to keep asking. Seems to me that we both agree on that point. \n\nHowever, my friends would probably say that I \u2018badger them constantly\u2019 about getting into reading, despite them politely declining every single time I\u2019ve ever asked. \n\nSo, what I\u2019m saying is, what my friends might consider \u2018badgering them to do something they\u2019ve made it clear they don\u2019t want to do,\u2019 I simply have a hard time seeing it that way. I\u2019m just trying to spread some of the joy I\u2019ve found, to the people around me. \n\nNow, I also can drink without it being an issue for me. I can see a potential situation where a younger me, might have offered my friends drinks every time we party. Even if they said no the last ten parties, I don\u2019t see any harm in asking once per party. They can always just say no, right? \n\nAnd to me, that would be the exact same level of evil as asking them once a month if they wanna try reading. Since I\u2019m stuck as myself, I\u2019m not capable of realizing that alcohol is freaky mind control-crack-poison-water, because why would I? I didn\u2019t know alcohol did that to people until I saw it happen. \n\nSo tell me, what\u2019s the difference (from the perspective of the offerer) between those two situations? \n\nOffering your friends something that makes you happy isn\u2019t inherently evil. Maybe people should be better about taking no for an answer, but all I\u2019m arguing here is that it doesn\u2019t necessarily make them bad friends, or bad people. \n\nPeople make mistakes, you know. And I\u2019m sure that there are plenty of things that we all do, that someone else would consider bad. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re all evil.",

I can drink half a bottle and I\u2019m not risking anything serious, but some people take one sip and can\u2019t stop. Or they become violent. In other words, they\u2026can\u2019t handle it. Is that offensive? If so, how else should I express that concept? \n\n2nd, what I perhaps didn\u2019t explain well enough, is that alcohol and reading are very similar *for me.* If I ask you if you want a drink, I\u2019m doing it for the *exact* same reasons I\u2019d ask someone to try reading Game of Thrones. \n\nNow, I fully understand that, *TO YOU,* the two aren\u2019t the same. I understand that there are *potentially* different consequences between drinking and reading. But TO ME, someone who can safely and responsibly read and drink, I think I should be forgiven for treating others the way I\u2019d like to be treated. \n\nAnd as I said in my previous post, it\u2019s different if you\u2019re aware of how many people have drinking problems. Once you\u2019ve gone out into the world, it\u2019s reasonable to be expected to understand that even just offering repeatedly can be putting someone in a compromising situation. But it doesn\u2019t always mean someone is evil or malicious just because they ask you a few times if you\u2019d like to join them in enjoying something they find safe and fun.",

This reads as if you're unaware of a significant third group, which is those who don't drink because they don't want to, which can have nothing to do with how well they handle alcohol.\n\nI'd also say reading and drinking are inherently different. And it requires a certain amount of denial or other form of distortion to equate them and say they're the same to you. \n\nI find it difficult to accept the idea that someone, an adult who drinks, can be oblivious to the many issues that alcohol cause. There's belligerent drunks, drunk accidents, puking, hangovers, regretful actions, forgetting last night, weight gain, etc. Even if you and your friends somehow manage to avoid it all, which is doubtful, I don't believe it's possible to not see any of it. Not without a certain amount of denial being involved.\n\nThose are my two cents based on limited information. I don't mean to insult or degrade you. You could be a great person, better than me. So I'm not claiming to be holier than thou or anything.",

Most people understand \u201cbadgering\u201d to be what it normally means, not what you interpreted. \n\nSo, to answer the question you gave me is that the difference between badgering somebody and asking them a genuine question is the annoying harassment. And harassment here isn\u2019t what people typically thing as lane angry and deliberate annoyance. If you just can\u2019t get why somebody won\u2019t drink, and you ask them, and they don\u2019t want to give you answer, continuing to ask is badgering them for a reason. \n\n> But, I will say, while you have every right to your own reasons and your own privacy, there\u2019s no need to be so hostile about other people having their own thoughts and feelings on the matter.\n\nThe person I\u2019m responding to, like you, failed to understand the standard definition of the term \u201cbadgering\u201d. That said, they then go on to explicitly explain that they they they should get a pass if they want to keep on pressing for answers because \u201cit\u2019s interesting\u201d to them. I would rather be mean now, and have them learn what they\u2019re Justifying is wrong *now*, than sugarcoat the fact that they\u2019re foo f to end up annoying the wrong person one day and receive a royal telling off. \n\nI\u2019m going to be clear: **continuing to ask somebody why they won\u2019t drink is badgering somebody to drink**. Drop the damn issue. I\u2019m being more polite than whatever person at the receiving end of this behavior would do when they run out of patience. I\u2019m another reply, this same come user tried to claim there is a difference between their asking and someone else\u2019s because their intention is different, but their isn\u2019t. After being denied a drink, you get 1 shot to ask a question as genuinely as possible, if that, because people who don\u2019t drink are likely going to be annoyed simply by the fact that there always has to be someone who asks. \n\n> If I offer you a drink and you say no, I\u2019m not gonna ask why not unless I know you to be a drinker in general. But I do find it super weird how defensive you are about your reasoning. Then again, if people are often pressuring you to drink after you say no, then I guess it makes sense.\n\nBecause what you and the other poster are justifying is *at best* a nuisance. \n\nI was constantly asked to say something in Spanish by kids who found out I was Puerto Rican. At some point, it didn\u2019t matter who asked the question and why, **I got tired of essentially being asked to perform Spanish to prove my ability to speak it**.\n\nIt\u2019s the same for people who don\u2019t drink, or don\u2019t participate in other normative cultural behaviors. \n\n\u201cWould you like a drink?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo thank you?\u201d\n\n\u201c<insert question that person has likely heard hundreds of times before>\u201d\n\nTo **you**, it\u2019s simple curiosity, and a harmless mistake. To somebody who doesn\u2019t drink, it\u2019s another confirmation that people will assume something f is \u201cwrong\u201d with them.\n\n> I dunno. Seems to me like you should have good reasons for not drinking, and maybe other people think that if you don\u2019t share your reasons, you don\u2019t have any? I can\u2019t speak for those people. It doesn\u2019t upset me if people don\u2019t like drinking.\n\nI have a great reason. I just don\u2019t. If anybody asks me, I\u2019ll say \u201cI don\u2019t drink like that\u201d. If they ask again, they\u2019ll either get the same answer, or I\u2019ll signal that they\u2019re being a nuisance. \n\n> For what it\u2019s worth, I love drinking since I was born responsible, but I wish it didn\u2019t fucking exist. Most people are too stupid/irresponsible to be trusted with alcohol. It\u2019s caused my loved ones far more pain, than it\u2019s brought us joy. I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s true for most people.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, how you feel about drinking doesn\u2019t matter. At the end of the day, the point of this conversation is that there is no reason why people who don\u2019t drink should be asked \u201cwhy\u201d. Alcohol is nothing more than a preference, just like the decision to eat or not eat practically anything else. \n\nThe only time asking somebody why they don\u2019t partake of any food item is acceptable is when trying to consider dietary restrictions/considerations. If somebody is severely allergic to a specific ingredient, If they\u2019ll end up being affected by the medication",

                              "text": "I\u2019m so sorry to hear that. I used to work for a small company that did Friday drinks. Most people had a drink or two, some didn\u2019t. We also had soft drinks (soda) and juice too. When a Muslim man joined the company, we got non alcoholic beer that he would drink. I\u2019m not sure if he asked first or if it was offered first, but once we knew he liked drinking it we got it for him, and asked what kind he liked so we knew he was enjoying it. Obviously you (or any other non-drinker) doesn\u2019t have to drink non alcoholic beer to fit in, but he liked it so we provided it. It would be so much better if your job gave you an option you could have if you wanted to join in on the Friday drinks. Personally I don\u2019t like beer so I wouldn\u2019t have had any, but they often have wine too. They really should have non alcoholic options as well, even just juice or soft drinks/ soda. \n\nWe did have two coworkers who just didn\u2019t get it, and would continually ask why they didn\u2019t drink, or how they relaxed at the end of the day/ week without alcohol, or watched sport without drinking. Personally I was a lot more worried for those people than the non drinkers. I did try telling them just to drop it, but this one guy just couldn\u2019t see that he was being rude. Once he did joke about spiking his coke with bourbon, in front of him, and I said that was absolutely not on and not to joke about it. We were out at lunch in a small group, no management present, but I ordered all the drinks then and assured him it was non alcoholic. I also mentioned it to management and they had a talk with both of them separately. They put the idiot joker in his place, and reassured the non drinker that no one would ever do that to him, and that the joker was told it was not acceptable and he would be sacked if he ever tried, which he was. The joker finally left it alone after that. \n\nWe also made sure there were Halal options for any food provided, or just bought all halal meat for the BBQs (grills in America, not American BBQ). We\u2019re Australian, in a big city with large Muslim populations so it\u2019s easy to find Halal food. It tasted the same as regular sausages, I didn\u2019t notice a difference. He said he really appreciated it, and liked that he didn\u2019t just get his own little plate or section for him. I was admin so I booked the dinners and organised the meals, I\u2019d consult everyone for preferences but made sure he knew what the halal options were, and never went with a place that couldn\u2019t provide any. Sometimes they only offered vegetarian or fish (which I\u2019m pretty sure is all halal by default, but I\u2019m not 100% sure), but I always wanted to make sure it was something he was happy with, and most of the time they could do a halal meat option too. \n\nWe had halal pizza a few times too. The salami was a bit different (normally it\u2019s made with pork, so it tasted different to what I\u2019m used to) but still good. Although I didn\u2019t have the spicy one which was apparently better, I just don\u2019t like spicy food. I\u2019m so sorry your workplace doesn\u2019t do better by you, and any other Muslim staff, or those who don\u2019t drink for religious reasons. Any reason for not drinking should be respected and not questioned. The most I would ask is \u201care you just not drinking today/ now, or should I stop offering you altogether?\u201d",

Stimulants suppress the \"downer\" effects of alcohol, meaning it'll take you more drinks before you feel noticably intoxicated, and far more than usual before you get to severe intoxication. For binge drinkers, the worst-case-scenario is you keep drinking before your body responds by being too sick to continue, and you end up comatose or dead due to alcohol poisoning before you or your friends realize you probably belong in an ER.\n\nThese two factors are why it's generally bad practice to mix stimulants like coffee or amphetamine like Adderall with alcohol - if you do, be mindful to drink slow and remember if you're drinking before the meds have totally worn off, you might not feel as drunk as you actually are in the moment.\n\nOh, and DRINK WATER",

Either she\u2019s not seriously in recovery/not taking recovery seriously, or it could not be that she was a legitimate addict that experiences dangerous WDs, and needs the shit to function, which is why she didn\u2019t take it as seriously. \n\nI know girls like this. They choose to stay sober not because they were really an alcoholic/addict but because they are just one of those people who can\u2019t handle drinking and binge drink and do other drugs \u201cto come back up\u201d when they do it, but it happens to be on small occasions, which is the worst part because it takes years of fucking up before they realize. \n\nIt takes years of waking up hella hungover and missing work and losing jobs, or other fuck ups before they realize maybe they shouldn\u2019t drink, even if it\u2019s just once a week. So it could be likely that she probably had learned by years of drinking and being stupid that she shouldn\u2019t drink and then after four years of watching herself, she went and did it anyway. \n\nRegardless, this woman\u2019s fianc\u00e9 did his future bride a major disservice, and she did herself one. They BOTH put OP in a shitty situation, and it\u2019s 100%**not OP\u2019s fuck up** in my opinion. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n*Personally to OP: I wouldn\u2019t be too hard on yourself OP! Maybe it worked out for the better? It\u2019s clear the bride still has room to grow. Maybe they will come out stronger after this or, if over, then maybe your friend dodged a bullet, or maybe they both dodged a bullet by wasting time with someone they aren\u2019t ready to settle down with. Either way, it\u2019s definitely NOT  your fault.*",

I'm a recovering heroin addict with about 5 and a half years, and damn near everyone knows I'm in recovery. I even organized a rally for International overdose awareness day and got the news to come and interview me, the whole bit.\n\nChemical dependency is similar to many other diseases, and the fact that it has a behavioral component doesn't make it any different from say, certain types of cancer, diabetes, or other mental health disorders. And it is ***extremely*** common, though the shame that many still feel around it keeps it in the shadows. Which can keep people sick and increase risks around relapse, like in OP's story. Nobody with a history of addiction should feel shame for it. Certainly, accept responsibility for doing everything it takes to stay sober. But don't feel bad for having the disease in the first place; that isn't anyone's fault.",

Getting a solid night of sleep the night before is so crucial to the day going well. \n\nEven if the night went as planned and they had tequila shots and a bunch of beers she would still have been waking up dusty as hell on the morning of her wedding and probably would have struggled to even get up in time. How often does a night of drinking ever go as planned either? 90% of the time when you go to the bar with a friend for \"just a couple of beers\" it turns into a big night regardless of how good your intentions were. Completely boneheaded move by OP. Not to mention it didn't sound like she did anything at all to slow down the trainwreck in progress like asking the bar staff to cut her off or even phoning her husband and explaining the fuckup and asking him to come help and get her out of there before things went further downhill. Instead she just went along for the ride until 4am.",

According to an article I found online that's not too far off from a lethal dose of sugar:\n\n\"In order to give yourself a 50-50 chance of consuming a lethal amount, you\u2019d need to ingest 13.5 grams of sugar for each pound of your body weight \u2014 and you\u2019d have to do it all in one sitting, according to the American Chemical Society. The average American man tips the scales at 195.5 pounds, according to data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. At that weight, he would have to eat and drink nearly 2,640 grams of sugar to have equal odds of living or dying.\"",

You say she had been sober 4 years - in that case she would've been quite aware of what was going on in her head. And whatever pushed her to drink again (maybe the marriage situation wasn't really up her alley?) she very likely relapsed mentally before she took the actual physical action. Which, by the way, is fairly normal - we have this movie concept of sobriety where it's a yes/no proposition, but a large proportion of addicts who become sober for life, do so after one or two or more relapses. I even did this myself - the one relapse I had, I actually planned. I sent my family off on a vacation and spent 6 days chugging supermarket wine before I called a few people and set my shit straight again. So, IMO, you may have catalyzed some shit happening, but the shit was a long time cooking.",

Same goes for parties where drugs are present etc. A relapse doesn\u2019t start with the first drink/ use of a drug. It\u2019s starts before, giving you the willingness to use again. She could have said that she didn\u2019t want to go drinking, she could have refused a drunk when she got there, but she didn\u2019t.  You have nothing to blame yourself for, unless you knew she was Al alcoholic before which you didn\u2019t.\n\nI hope she gets back on the wagon soon, bc when you relapse you start off where you left of, which is often basically in the pits of hell as you use, lie, steal etc and ruin your life. IMO she needs to go to rehab asap, and go to AA or NA. \n\nIf a friend invited to me at lace where my drug of choice was plentiful, I would be terrified, immediately say no.

I would also avoid the candies, personally.\n\nYour question is a little hard to answer, because -- can I eat them? Sure, I PROBABLY could and it would PROBABLY be fine... but I don't want to, because why would I risk undoing years of work with a little candy?

Have you ever had someone check something once before you left the house for a few days away, but maybe you also could've checked, even if the other person already did? Like setting the air conditioning or heat to an away temperature to not waste energy and money. Only to find out that they made a mistake before you left, and had you double-checked them, you'd have caught it? That's kind of like this. The responsibility lies with the bride, but the groom/friend could've done better than he did without actually currently being at fault for anything.",

Nobody's body should be forced to serve another just so that the other person can live. And furthermore, a choice to have sex does not deprive you of your right to bodily autonomy.

Why should a dead person have a greater right to their own body than a living woman?\n\nChildren have already been born, if someone doesn't want to be a parent, they can turn the kids over to the state or an adoption agency.

A dead person has a right to their own organs even if they could be used to keep someone alive.

And keep in mind, there are no states where late term abortion is even legal unless it is medically necessary to save the mother. Late term abortions are actually the most necessary abortions.\n\nAnd for the record, there is literally nothing in your link talking about viable fetuses being killed. It's just talking about how abortion is defined as well as how many procedures are performed each year that meet that definition.

They can only save your life involuntarily when you aren't conscious to be able to do so. Not going to a doctor is an option as well.\n\n>Anyways, bodily autonomy as you put it is not being physically depended on by anyone for labor of any sort.\n\nOh ffs how are you not understanding this? You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink, I guess. \n\nLabor has absolutely nothing to do with bodily autonomy. Bodily autonomy means control over your own living cells, nothing else. That means that nobody can do anything to your body, let alone reside in it, without your express consent. If you're working, it's because you chose to work. You don't have to work if you don't want to. Nobody can touch or put anything into your body unless you say they can.",

It almost sounds like she was harboring these doubts for a while and while I'm not suggesting that alcohol opened her up to the truth, she definitely wasn't 100% in it and it's probably better that she postponed.

It might have been easier for her if you hadn't taken her to a place with drinking, but again, I'm sure you would have gone that way had you known.\n\nLet them know you're sorry, but also lay it in that they should have told you. That's EXTREMELY important information when you're taking someone out. Drinking is implied, and extraneous circumstances should have been clarified.",

      "text": "I had a similar situation (though I was the bride so at least I didn't feel like I ruined a wedding.) \n\nI don't have many girl friends, and the ones that I did have at the time were my stoner/party buddies. I was by far the mildest of them, they partied hard. For a while before my wedding life was just hectic, we all went from working together and living near each other and hanging out every day to more distant - one friend lost her job and apartment, moved to another city to live with her mom, and pretty much dropped contact. We were never the call/text and chat types so it wasn't super weird to not hear from her when we weren't hanging out in person. \n\nWhen it came time for my bachelorette party I gathered my two party girls, a kind of mutual accquaintance I was just getting to know, a friend from school that I had only reconnected with once or twice over the years, and my brother's girlfriend. We went to a local bar for a concert/party and just hung out and drank and had some fun. We took a few rounds of shots and had a few beers, then the party girl who moved away started going to random people literally saying \"hey man, do you have any drugs?\" Singing \"drugs, drugs, gimme lots of drugs, I want to do drugs!\" etc. The school friend and brother's girlfriend were baffled, they'd never been in a group with someone who was so wasted, and definitely not someone asking for \"drugs.\" We decided to call it a night and had to drag/carry her across the parking lot to the car. Got fast food on the way home, she ate it in the car, then got pissed off that they left her order out when we got to the house and her food was gone. We finally convinced her that she already ate it and determined that she did not want any other snacks from around the house, then she passed out in a chair and pissed on it. She didn't even wake up when I changed her clothes and moved her so we could clean the chair.\n\nWe couldn't figure out why she got so hammered so fast - she was by far the heaviest drinker among us and was usually the last one to leave/pass out at parties. We knew she wasn't on anything else because she had stayed with the other party girl the night before and if she had anything she definitely would have shared it with her. \n\nTurned out when she moved away she *went to rehab* and had been sober for several months. Her tolerance tanked, she way outpaced herself trying to drink as much as she could as fast as she could, and she basically blacked out while her body went on a mission to find literally any drug. I felt fucking terrible about it, if I knew she was sober we would have just stayed at my house and had pizza and popcorn and watched horror movies or something. She definitely intentionally kept it from us and showed up ready to party. It sucks, but she made that choice. Your friend's fiance did, too. She very easily could have said \"actually I'm sober\" and suggested going out for milkshakes or something instead. It sucks a lot, it feels like your fault, but it's something that she has to deal with and come back from. I'm all for supporting recovery and not enabling addicts, If you knew it would have been a dick move, but you didn't know and couldn't know. The best thing you can do is be supportive of your friends as they work through whatever their next steps are.",

But it\u2019s so much more then that! It\u2019s a whole lifestyle change. Not just abstaining from your drug of choice, but changing your thinking, how you treat people and the world around you, & doing a lot of inside work to figure out your stressors and what makes you want to use. Sounds like she wasn\u2019t fully in recovery or just wanted an excuse to get out. Whatever it is, it\u2019s not on you! She\u2019s a grown ass adult who can make her own choices.",

It can be really easy as a person who isn't in recovery to want to take blame away from her for this, but in recovery there is an overwhelming responsibility placed on you to keep yourself out of situations precisely like the one you described and she knows this better than anyone; the reality of what you do and don't have control over is drilled into you.\n\nShe should have said no the moment you suggested drinks, and if you are as close to her as you seem to be, she should atleast let you know she doesn't/can't drink specifically so she doesn't have the ability to weaponize you against her recovery. Using people who don't know you aren't supposed to be doing what you are doing is a very, very common way people relapse.\n\nNot your fault.",

Just because she is an addict doesnt mean she needs to go off the rails in the way she did. What happened after she drank is still her responsibility. She absolutely did fuck up. Its unfortunate. There may have been something deeper lurking there, alcohol removes inhibitions, but typically doesnt cause people to do things they don't already have a desire to do, so there was probably a major problem with the relationship if she just broke up with him right there. And its very possible that this fuck up is actually a blessing in disguise and saved them both a lifetime of misery. But its still a fuck up.",

I stayed the night at their house with the bride.\n\nIt took me ages to sort out wtf was going on here.\n\nOP is female, her friend is male and has a \"fiance\" (male, not \"fiancee,\" female). So they're gay.\n\n\"When he moved with her\" okay, not gay, OP just put the \"(m)\" after friend by accident. The friend is female, the fiance male, she's forming a friendship with her female friend's husband-to-be. I think I know where this is going. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nOP's female friend stays over at her male SO's brother's ... uh oh, double trouble brewing here! But then op started at their house with the .... bride? Wait wtf is going on here? I thought op's friend was the bride, and she's at her so's brother's house...\n\nThat took a lot of effort to piece together.",

If somebody changed the whole peer group, it might be for a reason. If you moved for a partner, wouldn't your friends still to the Bachelorette party?\n\n2. Humans are for the most part social beings, we enjoy to exchange views or compare impressions. If you see someone getting quiet/distracted, it might be a hint for something in the bushes.\n\nBtw: whats wrong with the husband to be? He should have known about that problem and told you.

The bride yes, she said yes while sober, she walked into the bar sober, and she intentionally hid the fact that she was an addict while sober.\nYes, it can be hard to resist, but that's why we \nHave things we need to remind ourselves we wouldn't have without sobriety. I earned this with my sobriety. For example: I never wouldve developed this relationship that makes me so happy or have such a wonderful person in my life that i love so dearly and dont want to lose.\nWith what should have been the happiest day of her life on line, and she knew him even knowing she had a drink might do that... she was having those thoughts of doubt and cold feet before she took a sip.\nI'm not saying the friend should end the relationship per say, but her behavior doesn't bode well. She might already have been off the wagon as someone else here suggested. Regardless, a part of her didn't care about him. Is it the addiction or real feelings? Only she knows. He just needs to know that a relationship with alcoholic always runs the risk of another relapse. Especially because most of us have underlying mental health problems we either don't notice or refuse getting help for. He just needs to know that there will always be that risk that he will get his heart shattered, because that's what addiction does to our loved ones. Loving an addict isn't easy. I'd know. I'm in recovery, too. Thankfully able to refuse a drink easily for now, but the point t stands.\n\n\nEdit:\nActually I have more thoughts. Most people don't realize how easy it is as an addict to make a complete 180 based on your mental state and environment. She was probably nervous as heck, and convinced herself she could handle it, and then was like \"well I'm already drunk let's get high.\" It's a spiral that takes minutes at worst. And now I'm sure she feels awful, I do feel bad for her. I really do. But it's just not fair for anyone to shift blame on OP. Giving an alcoholic a free excuse is the worst thing to do when they're vulnerable and could easy dive deeper now that they are already ashamed of themselves. She needs to have accountability and go back to treatment now.",

I also take meds you don't ever want to mix with alcohol, unless you have a death wish. I tell people as we are planning \"I'd rather not go for drinks. A smoothie?\" I always have alternatives ready on hand, or order something else. \n\n\nFor example I live in a country where drinking is everywhere, all the time. If I won't  be able to drink but can't skip the event, I'll ask for coke, virgin mojitos or lemonade. Still looks cool, won't affect my health. If people are getting shots, i ask for a decoy shot or a coke and shot glass so I can participate in the activities. \n\n\nThere are a million ways out. She already chose to do so before you ever got to the bar, you don't have anything to blame yourself for. \n\n\nSome people say she should've told you, she or her bf. And I kinda disagree . Iam not ashamed of my past addictions but I can't judge actual or other recovering addicts for it. It takes a while to understand falling for it was hard, but climbing out of it is harder and you're a fucking badass for doing it. But she should've said something about it. I don't drink is a full sentence, and I like I said you have maaany other ways to get an out.\n\nHer fuck up not yours Op. You sound like a caring lind friend who got roped into something much above your pay grade. It's okay, sending you your friend and his fiancee love and good vibes.",

Every emotion and reaction they have after that is also their responsibility. Actually, even before that, too.\n\nActually, and some people who aren't super accountable may be upset about this statement, I would argue that EVEN IF you knew they were a recovering alcoholic, it is still on them if they chose to consume alcohol. That's part of being an adult, knowing that you are susceptible to certain scenarios, and avoiding or mitigating those situations.\n\nYou didn't fuck up. Your friend did.
