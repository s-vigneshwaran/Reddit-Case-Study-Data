Women will have a kid and the attitude of \"I don't need men\", and then be championed for being so strong because she is a single mother.  Which if you are trying to shape society, because as women we are the ones who have that power (motherhood), it seems so strange to do something that is statistically overwhelming against what you are trying to change but take power and pride in something that seems to be a big root cause (referring to how it's like 85% or whatever of felons were raised by a single mother).  Like why not have a good man as a role model for your boy to grow up into, wait for it, a good man?  Instead it's single mom power! and telling their boys how shitty they are by proxy telling them how bad men in general are.\n\nWomen, feminism, could literally reshape society in a generation, mothers have that much power (they are the primary teacher to kids), yet they choose to continue to repeat the cycle basically out of spite.  Sometimes I think a lot of feminists want to raise bad men or make men filled with spite, I can't come up with a logical reason why you would be so counter productive to your mission.",

Not to mention by the time they might cone to terms with their contribution to the issue it's too late.\n\nA guy can clean up his act, get his ducks in a row, and go on to have a better life as late as his 30s or 40s... a woman doesn't have that ability, and certainly not as a single mother. She'll most likely no longer be marketable to find a good partner and fix her home, and without that her kids aren't going to actually learn to appreciate how important fathers are, so the chances they'll listen even if she's warning them are low. \n\nWe need to not only stress the importance of fathers and male role models more, but we need to incentivize men and women to get involved as a community to fix the issue. Not having a good father can be partially overcome by having other reliable male figures around... the mothers need to support and seek out men willing to fill that role even if they're not a marriage partner, and men who want to fix the community should try to make themselves available to bond with and mentor the kids.",

But these dumb feminists on the net go out of their way to belittle our contributions.",
