Double clutching is (was) very much a thing.\n\nIt just means to use the clutch pedal twice when shifting gears. You clutch to shift into neutral, then Rev to appropriate rpm, then clutch to shift into your new gear. \n\nWhy you might have never heard of it is because it isn't necessary on any halfway modern car and hasn't been for what I understand a pretty long time, transmissions handle meshing gears themselves now",

Say your in 5th gear at 1500rpm, and if you shifted down to 4th at the same speed your engine would need to be running at 4000 rpm (I'm pulling these numbers out of my ass), before you had more sophisticated transmissions you would have to do that yourself (or get it close) so that you don't put added strain on the gear shift.\n\nFor example, You would shift into neutral because it's a safe gear to shift into, Rev to about 4000, then clutch again and shift into 4th.\n\nIf shifting up you would let the engine rev down before making the shift.\n\nYou could probably use it to jump gears as well, although I could only see that being useful in something like an endurance or rally race and you've lost a gear or something.\n\n[This guy explains it really well](https://youtu.be/tescWzTlGQ0)",

The neutral shift and clutch release is pointless unless you're just learning how to drive and gives you an extra second to think and not grind the gears. Or something like that.",

Water can only become more hot by getting heat energy from other sources. So in this case, the nuclear reactor core is getting hit and creating heat energy. The energy transfers to the water causing it to heat up annd vaporize. When the heat energy goes to water it leaves the nuclear reactor- energy can not be created or destroyed, only transferred. So yeah, hope that makes sense.",

I think she meant strongest consumer computer, but she only has one graphics card, and she never listed what CPU it is, so what benchmarks its flexing is kinda unknown. Also is that the 3090 gtx? Because they are notorious for graphic based crashes. I think she asked for the strongest computer her 10000 dollars would get her, and she took it as the strongest computer in the world.....",

A gpu is IN a graphics card, but is not the graphics card.\n\nA graphics card consists of the GPU (the expensive chip, which looks a lot like a cpu, and is made by one of two or three companies), RAM, and a circuit board with a bunch of other shtuffs, plus fans, plus casing. Graphics cards are based on a general architecture the GPU manufacturer comes up with and then made by one of dozens of third party manufacturers\u2026 including the one that made the GPU.\n\nYou rarely see GPU\u2019s sold separately to the graphics card. But they are different. GPU is a tiny chip, and the graphics card is a big block containing a bunch of stuff that you slot into your motherboard.\n\nAnd, fun note, your GPU itself can also contain memory called cache memory. Just like the CPU. I don\u2019t know if any GPU\u2019s do, but it\u2019s a possibility. So you could have memory in your cpu, memory in your gpu, ram memory in your graphics card, ram memory on your motherboard, m2 memory on your motherboard, an ssd on a sata cable, an HDD on a sata cable, and an external hdd or ssd connected via usb. That\u2019s a lot of different types of memory.\n\nAnd the reason we have so many different types is because the speed of light traveling a few centimeters is much too slow for computers to operate as fast as we want them to. Stupid lazy electrons. Go faster!!!",

Their customer support is also killer, they mailed out replacements to people whose cards got burned out by New World before they even confirmed the issue themselves.",

Their customer support is lacking for sure, but their cards have largely been fine. \n\nEVGA had a model early in the 2000 series that would consistently have a specific component fail violently if the customer complained about a specific performance issue. We could put the card on a bench, start filming that specific spot, boot up firmark and BOOM. Their warranty would just say that their cards don't fail like that and it must have been tampered with/user error, even with the video. We had to drag them kicking and screaming to replace them.\n\nNot every brand is infallible.",

I think the card is either just slightly bigger or smaller than a 3090 by the way. (It was actually very quiet though, until one of the fans gave out and started making a loud rattling noise... Which is weird since they would only spin when under heavy load? idk probably just a shit-tier fan.)",

And honestly, the market for PC components isn't that big in the top end so this might as well be the \"most powerful PC in the world\", or tied to first anyway.\n\nBut it also really depends on what you consider to be the most powerful. If you mean pure processing power, then you'd have a built that looks like this:\n\nCPU: 2x Intel Xeon Platinum 9282\n\nRAM: 24x128GB DDR4-2933\n\nGPU: 3x Quadro RTX 8000\n\nA PC like this *could* be built into something that looks like a regular ish desktop, like the one in the video, but it'd also cost just shy of $100k so i *really* doubt that's what this is.\n\nIf i were to guess, this PC has the following specs:\n\nCPU: 1x AMD Threadripper 3990x\n\nRAM: 8x32GB DDR4-3600\n\nGPU: 1x GeForce RTX 3090\n\nThis rig would cost around $7000-8000, so less than a 10th of the previous PC, but for most workloads it'd perform about as well even if the raw processing power isn't quite there. In some tasks it'd even outperform the $100k rig, meaning you could in some way call this $7000k PC the most powerful PC in the world, if you build one with these parts.\n\nThat said, this chick has ZERO idea what she's talking about, period.",

Ram is just for temporary storage of things like variables or images. The only storage neccesary is to tell the processing unit how to process a calculation.\n\nHowever, going to the other side of the spectrum: A lot of so-called supercomputers are made out of multiple computers, meaning that they function on par with eachother, they might all calculate the same, for performance(to see which gives the first output), or different parts of an equation, to see how fast they can work together.\n\nBut if you look at the exact situation: She's really not much more than someone who presents things and makes videos about it. Exaggerating means content, so that's what she does. A bit part of her audience likes cars, and a lot of them probably won't care for shits about gaming computers, they just like to see the cars she presents to them.",

This chick doesn't know what she's talking about. \n\nThis has nothing to do with her being a woman and everything to do just with not knowing about pcs. I'd say the same thing if that was a guy. That's probably the first time shes seen a PC case that lights up lmao\n\nThe most powerful graphics card in the world !!! It's called a GeForce rtx!!! Wow you can tell she has no clue what she's talking about. And it's cooled by....water!?!?! Whoa it's one of a kind, never seen anything like it.\n\nIf you wanna talk pcs, you better know your stuff.
