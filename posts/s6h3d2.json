Point is that Martin Luther was kind of a piece of shit.\n\nMartin Luther was also a raging misogynist. His goal wasn't to form a protestant church, which is what ended up happening, but instead to simply reform the catholic church. He had good arguments against the catholic church of the time (as there are arguments against it now as well as much of institutionalized Christianity). But he was antiscience, against people like Galileo, who went against church authorities to publish the truth. And again, raging misogyny. You're not off base to be critical of Martin Luther. I say this as a Christian who was raised protestant. People valorize him for his 99 theses, but I'm not so sure that's called for. And as you say, Christian antisemitism is a serious problem and has been for centuries. Martin Luther was part of that problem.\n\nEven MLK had some shortcomings. That said, he was murdered in cold blood while working to further a movement that owed much to the work of black women. So the way I see it, OG Martin Luther was arguably far worse than even Jesus on women's issues. But MLK, while not perfect, has a legacy genuinely worthy of an actual defense in public life and in our history books. Especially when the right seeks to whitewash him.\n\nEdit: also, related to the original comment on this thread, Lincoln himself is also not really a good antiracist figure. But I'll leave explaining that to some else because my thumbs are tired.",

                      "text": "Yeah we all have cultural baggage to shed for sure. I once heard Brother Ali talk about how he regretted having used the f slur in his older music. And it\u2019s been really awesome to see his content progress from mostly ego flexing to messages of universal love and justice!\n\nI haven\u2019t heard Technique talk about it but he strikes me as a humble and educated dude. If he hasn\u2019t yet unpacked that baggage I bet he will when he\u2019s ready. \n\nI don\u2019t recall Tribe explicitly going against that type of programming, but they did have a chiller vibe than most. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if they were the first but if you\u2019ve never heard that Coup album \u201cKill My Landlord\u201d from my link above, definitely check it out. That was from 1993, and in 94 they dropped \u201cGenocide and Juice.\u201d Both of those were extremely revolutionary especially for that era. \n\nAnd though they probably had some toxic masculine energy due to being from the mean streets of Oakland, their DJ was a woman and a lot of their messages were pro feminist. Like in their song \u201cThe Coup\u201d from KML, Boots spits\n\n> The uzis that were once used to kill each other\n\n> are now used to serve and protect the brothers\n\n> And the sisters cuz they packin 45\u2019s and 9\u2019s\n\n> We down for revolution not just down for they behinds\n\nIn 19 fucking 93. Around the same time Snoop and Dre and them were pushing nothing but bitches this and hoes that. No wonder the industry made them household names and blacklisted groups like The Coup, smh\n\nAnd agreed, I was never a fan of Eminem. Obviously talented but his vocal tone is obnoxious to me, and of course so is his shock value content. \n\nI did gain some respect for him a few years back though, when he did that BET cypher shitting on trump. Mainly because he said something to the effect of \u201cif you\u2019re a fan of me and also a fan of him, then fuck off I don\u2019t want you as a fan\u201d\n\nGranted, he could afford to lose fans at that point in his career, and I\u2019m not saying he deserved the Nobel prize or anything. But I respected it because he was one of the few massively popular voices who probably had a lot of trump supporters in his following, some of whom might have taken a step back and reconsidered when they heard that.

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\u2019s great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen\u2019s Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to 'order' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: 'I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action'; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man\u2019s freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a 'more convenient season.' Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\"",
