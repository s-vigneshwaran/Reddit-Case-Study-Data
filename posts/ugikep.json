  "text": "TIFU by helping drunk coworker and trusting HR\nEdit: [UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/user/HeyItsYonder/comments/ujzpso/update/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) is posted on my profile\n\n\nI (29M) work in digital marketing. Company held party to celebrate the completion of big project. As I was walking to my car, I noticed a drunk female coworker (mid 30s). We worked together for 3 years, but it's a big department and I don't know much about her. \n\nShe was having difficulty walking. I offered to help and she held out her hand. I asked if she drove here. She took an Uber. Helped her call another one as she vomited. Uber driver arrived, saw the condition she was in, and took off without saying a word. Understandable. \n \nI decided to drive her home. I have a duel front and rear dashcam setup. I moved the rear camera, placed it in front, and adjusted angle to make sure inside of vehicle is covered (lifesaver). \n\nFast forward one month to April 25 (last week) and I was called into HR. My manager was sitting with a serious expression. They asked what I did after the party. I immediately became defensive and asked what the meeting is about. \n\nHR person said that they received a complaint from an employee accusing me of inappropriate behavior. I responded, \"I have no idea what you are talking about. I did nothing inappropriate during or after that party. Whoever complained has the wrong guy!\"\n\nThey stepped out into the hallway for a couple minutes. I'm starting to sweat even though I did nothing wrong. Thinking, I remember giving coworker a ride home. That must be it. They step back into the office, manager says they have a witness who saw me put drunk coworker into my car. \n\nI said, \"Yea, I drove her home. Nothing happened...and I did not 'put' her in. She accepted the help.\" Silence. They stare at me like I'm guilty. Nothing but suspicion and judgement. HR says they'll continue investigating and will speak to me the following week.\n\nI received an email today, telling me to make a statement for the police and that I'm suspended until the case is dismissed. I'm pissed. Really pissed.\n\nI hired an attorney and submitted statement to police. After asking around, I learned the coworker I gave a ride to is apparently the ex-wife of my manager's golfing buddy. Yea. \n\nLittle does the company know I protected myself with dashcam footage as well as a short cell phone video of me walking her to the house. I am innocent and will fight this.\n\nTL;DR - I drove drunk coworker home. Accused of inappropriate behavior one month later. Suspended by my company while they investigate. I hired attorney and have video footage proving my innocence.",

Not nearly as serious as OP, but I was part of a group of seven people that came forward to report a school principal for CBA violations, gender discrimination, targeted harassment, numerous infractions that violated district policies. HR did everything they could to protect their administration and image, including not speaking with witnesses, dismissing non protected employees, transferring some of us and verifiably altering dates, times and emails. The results of the investigation were given when I was on vacation and I was only given ten calendar days, not business days, to write a written appeal. This was done over winter break where there are only 4 days our administrative office is open. I sent an email letter demanding an appeal before the board. The email appeal didn't count, and my Union didn't fight that decision. We're still trying to get a legal case for CBA violations and damages.\n\nDon't trust HR and lawyer up. You're being accused of rape because someone got in your car. The police are involved so it's moved outside of HR. Be as proactive as you can. I know a woman who's husband was accused of something similar. It took two years to clear him. Best of luck to OP.",

I don't know how the law works in that (or any other really) matter, but being in such a situation must be hella stressful and generally hard on someone's mental state.

Working the door in front of my friends bar/lounge for a after hours event. \n\nA young lady came up and said this guy was aggressively flirty with her and her friend and she *thought* she might have saw him attempt to put something in her friends drink. She gave us a description of the guy. Sure enough as me and another guy walk in and start scanning i find the guy and point him out to the other guy and we kind of just watch him, not even a minute later after we start watching him he went up to another girl who was more receptive of his flirting but we saw him reaching and dumping some powder out of a capsule into her drink. We immediately came up to them and i grabbed the drink from her hand and the other guy partially steeped in between them and asked him what the powder was that he poured into her drink. He said it was \"bc powder because she has a headache\" looked towards the girl who now has a disgusted look saying she doesnt and didnt know he put anything in her drink. (he continued arguing it was nothing while we escorted him out and outside kept insisting it was BC powder but had no explanation for why it was poured out of a popped in half pill capsule). \n\nI waved another staff to take her from there (we got her a new non laced drink now lol) and we kicked him out. He came back up a few minutes later trying to get in and we had to physically stop him from pushing past us and he just kept getting more agitated saying he left his phone, so we werent total dicks i sent the other door guy to where he was sitting and sure enough his phone was in the side of the chair cushion along with a baggy of about 30 more pills (we suspected molly). Gave him his phone and told him to leave... he had the nerve to ask if we found anything else by his phone? When the other door guy (who found the baggy) asked what else should we have looked for he just insisted on coming in and looking himself, we eventually told him if its the drugs he wants back he can wait to talk to the police and get them back. He ran off after that. \n\nTurned the drugs in to some passing cop told him the story but since none of the girls were there anymore that dealt with him and there were no cameras in the lounge at the time, they just took the baggy and his description and continued down the strip. \n\nWent off on a tangent there but yeah he balled up his fist and tried to step up to two security/door guys because we caught him slipping molly or something else in a girls drink and then tried to fight us again when we wouldn't let him in to look for his drugs after kicking him out for that.",

If he dropped her off and immediately left, he should be able to demonstrate this with the timestamp from the in-car security cameras. Showing footage of him leaving a minute or so after dropping her off would be near dispositive in this instance, depending upon the precise details of the accusation. But this crucial piece of evidence is not mentioned. Why? He documented everything up to his arrival at her door, but nothing after? Color me skeptical. \n\nHis behavior suggests he was reasonably certain he would be made to answer questions about his conduct that night. Additionally, he is clearly omitting some relevant details. The fact that his video documentation ends at her door suggests he spent some time at her house. Otherwise, he would have mentioned video of him driving home as evidence of his innocence. The abrupt end to his video documentation suggests to me that the impetus for documenting his behavior before he got to her house was the behavior he had planned once he got her inside. Moving a security camera and recording walking to her door is strange behavior. It suggests fear of accusation. But if he were simply being unusually cautious, the exculpatory evidence would not end at her door. His behavior describes a pretty good strategy for cultivating reasonable doubt in the minds of any potential investigators. Perhaps this is a coincidence. Perhaps this isn't his first brush with this type of investigation.",

The implication that the accusation is being leveled due to an acrimonious divorce seems to be a non sequitur deployed as a desperate post hoc explanation for why OP would be subjected to malicious accusations. If the divorce was contentious and the manager unscrupulous, wouldn't the retaliation be directed towards the ex-wife? And if the dissolution of the marriage was a mutual desire and everyone remains friendly, why would anyone care that she was seen leaving the party with a single man? To be explicit, why would a vindictive ex-husband care that his ex-wife was allegedly assaulted? Would he not delight in her misfortune? And if they are friendly, it would not explain why there would be a false accusation.\n\nAnd of course the insinuation that HR would reflexively back the accuser is itself flawed. The incident occurred following a company event in which alcohol was served. If the claims against OP are substantiated, there will be severe reprocussions for management throughout the corporate hierarchy. It would be best for the manager, his boss, his boss's boss and the entire HR department if nothing untoward happened that night. The incentive for unethical behavior works entirely in OP's direction. Yet OP claims that his manager and the HR department are arrayed against him, despite the professional reprocussions that will happen should the accusation be substantiated.",

The assault accusation was made in good faith because, despite the divorce not going well, the ex wants to get back with her, and thus will act in (what he thinks is) her best interest outside of the breakup. Or, in a similar line of thought, the ex would be hurt by the thought of her doing anything with someone else willingly, but can handle it if there's a legal case saying it wasn't consensual.\n\n2. The assault accusation was made in bad faith to punish OP for helping her, hoping to alienate her from others that might otherwise help her. \"OP got in trouble for helping her, therefore I will just ignore the issue to avoid trouble for myself.\" Or, another similar line of thought, punish them both in case there was mutual interest.\n\nYou could be right, but it's not cut and dry.",

Perhaps my own loquacious tendencies obscured my point. If the accusation were made in service of a malicious campaign following a contentious divorce, it would have not have produced an investigation absent the participation of the accuser. There is absolutely no reason the accuser would affirmatively take action to contribute to her own ongoing abuse. There is also no reason for the manager to risk his job to cause an investigation that is automatically triggered by an accusation. An accusation is necessary for an investigation to begin and an accusation is sufficient to cause an investigation to begin. \n\nOP would have us believe that multiple people are engaging in a tortious conspiracy to defame him. Additionally, two members of this conspiracy are exposing themselves to civil liability by inserting themselves unnecessarily into the process. Moreover, the accuser has also invited criminal exposure by filing a false police report that has zero influence or relevance upon the internal HR investigation. And all of this misfortune has befallen OP despite his unusual efforts to document his behavior that night. That story is not credible, and OP knows it isn't credible. He needed some explanation for why he would be so unfairly maligned. But his explanation is irrelevant and not exculpatory, just like his video of his interaction and conduct towards his accuser prior to the time at which the alleged misconduct occurred.",

Not to the police?\n\nThe other twist is that ex husband did see him bring her home and did it himself and then blamed OP and had that \"proof\" to shield himself. But yea I can just see it being simply an overly concerned party trying to speak on her behalf when even she was fine. It sounds like a place that would put in place a policy where coworkers can't drive each other anywhere alone. Always has to be a group with one manager or something.",

A written statement either makes the author admit fault to a problem or blame someone specifically - either way, it shifts the blame away from the company and onto a specific person who made a bad choice. \n\nIf they collect a written statement from you and they want to get rid of you, they have unlimited time to read through everything you wrote to find something to fire you for. Alternatively, they can collect written statements from other coworkers/managers and if there are conflicts between the two, they can fire you for lying in a written statement and they have another statement to \u201cprove\u201d it. \n\nAlso, HR can collect written statements and bring them into a meeting where they decide how to handle the situation and then use them to write a short explanation of why they made the decision they did and use those statements to back it up - regardless of what *actually* happened. At this point, the unscrupulous ones among us may \u201close\u201d certain statements and retain only the statements that corroborate the version of events they like the most. Honest HR workers won\u2019t lose any statements, but either way the actual truth of the matter is only secondary to what is in the written statements. \n\nThey can also hold on to your written statement indefinitely. Something could happen 5 years from today, and HR could whip out a statement from today to \u201cestablish a pattern of behavior\u201d if they want to. \n\nHR exists to protect the *company*. Sometimes that lines up with your needs and sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\n\nTL;DR written statements essentially force you to put all your cards on the table while HR puts none of theirs (aside from admitting that they\u2019re \u201ccurrently investigating\u201d). It\u2019s like playing poker with someone except you literally put your cards in their hand while they decide how to play theirs.",

So as a teenager she was told this happened when she was a young child. \n\nThis is not in my dad's nature AT ALL. He is literally the chillest (too chill) guy I know.\n\nAnd also, if he DID he would never be dumb enough to do it in front of a witness.\n\nBut after years of my SIL telling my neice she heard this, she thinks she did.\n\nI have to wonder if this went from \"Oh OP helped Sally out\" to something more nefarious over time and suggestion and retelling. So glad OP has those recordings, really sad he needs them. \n\n(For the record, even though she is now ex SIL my parents have never bad mouthed her in front of her kids. She's a real piece of work.. Ruined the birth of her first grandchild, when another grandchild was on the hospital the kids were straight up shocked when she sent a text acknowledging it, etc).",

As an example if the woman believed she was assaulted, but either it was not him or did not happen then it's possible for her to believe he did that and report it even though it is false.\n\nThis is a relatively common problem: people attributing a crime done to a wrong person or making a mistake and thinking something is a crime when it is not.  These are not criminal actions.\n\nMaking a police report for something you do know IS not a crime or that you know the person you accuse did not do, however, is a crime.",

If the boss who's friends with the drunk co-workers ex-husband filed the complaint and said they saw more than just OP driving the co-worker home as a favor to them then that IS ill intent and willful deception. \n\nHell we don't even know what the original complaint stated or if the co-worker also complained. Maybe she was assaulted that night after being dropped off but can't remember anything and the only lead they have in investigating it is the complaint stating OP was the last person seen with the co-worker. The job of the police is to investigate that lead and see if it reveals what happened.\n\nThe key is INVESTIGATE. If OP is found to have no fault then it should be clearly made known they were deemed not responsible via the evidence provided from the OP's video's.\n\nDue process is extremely important, otherwise I could file a complaint against you for trying to get the person arrested for filing a false complaint when in reality you are jumping to conclusions that you really don't have any basis to make.",

Misunderstanding.\"\n\nHe should also include in his statement the rejected uber. Uber can provide the record that proves their driver declined the ride on arrival due to the condition of the rider, but won't without a subpoena. Having that in the police report enables his attorney to file that subpoena without much resistance in case the magistrate is an idiot.\n\nThe company is 100% on the hook if things happened the way OP saod they did, and OP?

In the case of the police it's the government first and then the public.  In HR's case it's the company first and then management.  This is because the public and\\or management has so much power to influence their job that they can't ignore them.\n\nThere are times you need to provide a statement but it should be carefully thought out and to the best of your ability include professional help to navigate the dangers of what you're going to be telling them.\n\nAs an example of if in the video proving his innocence he admits to several burglaries in the area and is smoking crack rock, his lawyer may suggest he not bring those videos up to the police at all.  He doesn't mention this here, but generally one doesn't brag about those things unless they get caught a lot and don't mind.\n\nIf the video doesn't implicate him in other crimes and just proves his innocence, then the lawyer will suggest that the video be given to the cops with a careful statement well written to minimize risk that the cops will use it against you in some way.\n\nLikewise OP's lawyer can probably suggest that they bring the company legal department in on this and I bet HR gets a lot less sure of themselves really quickly.  the only thing HR is more scared of that management, is the legal department.\n\nedit:  side note -- HR is scared of the legal department because their job is mitigating risks to the company and they know what happens if they become the risk.  They get mitigated.  Bringing organization legal into the picture greatly increases the risk that HR will become the threat to the company and get mitigated.  This tends to solve your problem for you, because HR will suddenly do everything in their power to make you go away and because legal is in the room firing is generally off the table.  This situation played right and not overly leveraged can make you nearly invincible for a short time as it any firing they would do will need to be vetted by legal as a result of this to make sure they don't suddenly become the risk again too.",

So if questioned by the police, say your legal name and \"I would like to talk to a lawyer\". Do not say \"I would like to talk to a lawyer, dawg\" because there is case history that says a defendant asking for a lawyer dawg is not asking for a lawyer because police are incompetent assholes protected by corrupt judges.\n\nIn the Netflix series Luke Cage, there is an amazing scene of one of the \"bad guys\" going through an interrogation correctly. Every answer he gives is asking for a lawyer, even though police are supposed to stop interrogating after someone invokes their right to an attorney, any statement to police can still be used against them.\n\nAlso be aware the best interrogation techniques actually don't involve any torture or inconvenience at all. There was a cold case where investigators met with the prime suspect 5 years later in the lobby of a hotel. They carried on a friendly conversation for hours until the the guy voluntarily confessed. \"good cop, good cop\" actually results in more confessions than intimidation. So if cops sit you on a comfortable couch and offer snacks or a drink \"outside the interrogation room\" you're still in the interrogation room. A comfortable sitting room interrogation doesn't make for good TV. Fortunately most police departments aren't that smart, and it's something even the intelligience agencies haven't formalized.",

OP should definitely talk to a lawyer about the situation, regardless of whether or not the suspension is paid, and can talk about that factor with said lawyer if they are not being paid.\n\nAs you said, OP should also be able to apply for unemployment. I do know that (in some states at least) you can apply for unemployment while on suspension, even if you are being paid for that suspension.\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a lawyer and, as already stated, the facts surrounding things may change based on location and specifics of the situation.",

It's often very, very scary to be the woman in that situation - we're constantly told that we need to protect ourselves, we constantly hear about what happened to our friends, we very often have very scary/upsetting memories, and men are big and strong. It can also be very scary to wake up, sometimes with bruises you don't remember (from falling or someone pulling you away from doing something stupid or whatever), only remembering that a man moved you around. When you're very drunk, being picked up/physically manipulated in a helping way doesn't feel much different from being picked up/physically manipulated in a scary way. Obviously I'm not saying that only men rape/commit assault, but so many more men do that you end up finding strange men scary in a way that strange women just aren't. It's really unfortunate, but it's true. Flagging down a woman is likely not only to be less scary to the drunk woman at the time, but also potentially the next morning. Finally, from the other side, I have ALWAYS been grateful to be flagged down to help a drunk woman - I'd rather help her and know she's safe than see her go off with a strange man (which I know is sad), and rather her possibly be more comfortable (which might mean I can do more to help her - I've had a woman refuse to say anything to my male friend and then tell me her mum's phone number), and I'd rather someone did that if I was in that situation. Also, we do understand your position - we don't want you to be put in the position of helping her with a danger to you.",

The cops were great and treated you like people. You could go out and miss the last bus of the night to get home and ask an office for a ride home - no questions asked, no problem. The will give you a ride or give you a voucher for the taxi. I tried that in the city and everyone I was with stopped me because they didn't want to deal with possibly getting arrested for being drunk in public, even though we were just trying to get home. I knew a few of the officers in the mountain town and they were, and are, genuinely good people, as are the others on that police force. I could joke with them and give them a hard time and we all would laugh. This is how it should be, everywhere. The assumption that they are out to get you and are as bad as thugs does not apply to everyone, and shouldn't be anyone's first reaction",

If the US really wants to get out of this hole we're in, we need to focus on strengthening civil rights, clean and green renewable energy (including vehicles), and do away with outdated systems; i.e. daylight savings time, electoral college and a two party voting system. Let everyone be included in decision making. It would be rough at first but we could do it, but most of the GOP and half the Libs are scared of any change because they were all born in the 1940s and think rent is still 71 dollars a month.

So I wouldn't necessarily say that the majority get what they want since we can't have the things other 1st world countries have; i.e. health-care systems that aren't predatory, real workers rights that protect the workers over the large corporations that union-bust, and an education system that isn't completely bottom of the barrel.",

Right, I claimed they are more likely to be bad than your average citizen, which is true since citizens have to actually worry about being arrested and losing their jobs. \n\n>Based on selective media attention and few extremely left leaning ideologies.\n\nNope even ACAB isn't saying every cop is going to harm you, just that cops don't rat each other out so even the \"good\" ones are bastards for siding with their fellow cops over the public at large. \n\n>Unless you are telling me that you have interacted with every single cop from every district, if you haven\u2019 you are generalizing.\n\nAnd you're clearly generalizing in saying cops are good and r should trust them.

Police aren't known for being kind to people, especially drunk people, when arresting them\n\nThen there's the whole charging process. The lady could (and very likely would) be charged with public intoxication. God forbid she is homeless or for some reason (spousal abuse perhaps) doesn't want to return to her house. Then she's in legal trouble for not having a house. \n\nThe risks to her are high, with both a high severity and a high likelihood of occurrence. The risk to me would be lower, my life isn't at risk, and the risk for lesser damages are lower (not many women falsely accuse others of sexual assault).",

Plus, plenty of people thought I was a creep for the rest of college.\n\nAfter that, I record everything, don't offer help directly, and generally try to stay away from any drunk women.

                          "text": "> Fighting in court is no easy task and will scar you for life.\n\nThe thing is, even if you manage to get the absolute best possible outcome, meaning you're completely cleared legally and you managed to get back your legal fees, you've still wasted tons of time, you've still gone through that emotional rollercoaster, and you can still look like shit in the court of public opinion.\n\nJust because you end up safe legally doesn't even mean everything will go back to normal. I've heard quite a few cases of similar situations on Reddit where guys have won false rape accusation cases and they were still pretty much socially exiled from their community. They end up losing friends and family members, and sometimes even their job because not all employers will keep you around even if you're found innocent.\n\nThis kind of shit can seriously ruin a person's life. In my opinion, anyone involved in aiding or spreading of false rape accusations should get the same time as someone who actually committed rape. There needs to be a serious deterrent in place to keep people from even considering lying about being raped. Obviously it should have to be proven with solid evidence that the rape accusation is fabricated, so as not to discourage legitimate rape victims from coming forward, but there really needs to be harsher punishments for the liars out there because of how much damage this can potentially do to a person.",

So I'm with her, and I'm not just gonna abandon her in the outskirts of a major city at 3AM with no way home with NOBODY around.  So I call an Uber, and bring her back to the Airbnb.  She had trouble finding it, so I ended up having to change the location a few times.\n\nThe driver was giving me the dirtiest looks in the rear view mirror - and like, I totally understand.  This absolutely looked like a potential abusive situation, like, good on him.  But me, whose just trying to get this girl safely home, is being seen in a very potentially damaging light.  Like she was way too drunk, no way I was going to try anything, even though this was a date.\n\nFinally, she finds her address, and at that point it's 4AM. I've racked up over 100$ in a single Uber ride.  She lets me crash on the couch of the AirBNB she was staying in.",

Previously, the company took a gender neutral stance and helped those who were closest to their centers first. The woman claimed they were not treating her equally to men, made a stink on social media and forced them to change their policy. A man who is stuck on the roadside is no less vulnerable and yet a woman's life is being treated as more valuable than a man's.\n\nWhen society throws this shit at you, and when lending a helping hand could destroy your life, it's better to do nothing and just leave the drunk woman where she lies. She needs to take personal responsibility by not getting blackout drunk first. He owes her as much as she owes him if the genders were reversed, which isn't much at all.\n\nHow seriously would a complaint about inappropriate behaviour be taken from HR were the genders reversed? Would a woman even need dashcam footage?",

Someone unable to walk from being too drunk is not a crime. You have a responsibility as a citizen to report a crime in progress.\n\nAnd yes, she could have accused all three men of raping her. Who would the media and the public believe?\n\nGo look for the story about Mattress Girl and the title IX violations at universities. Universities adopted the policy that women could accuse anyone of rape or sexual assault. The university denied the accused the right to due process and expelled these young men with nothing more than an accusation. As a result they are getting sued for millions now. Many of these young men had text messages proving it was consensual. They were lucky.\n\nWhat about the man who doesn't have digital footage? What happens if he doesn't have a witness and he is doing the right thing? One accusation and his reputation is ruined. Everyone will believe her first.\n\nCan you really blame someone for not wanting to get involved when doing the right thing may ruin their lives?\n\n>I feel so sad for the human race truly to know we mostly view each other as potential threats instead of brothers and sisters.\n\nThing is that people keep pointing this out and people keep arguing against it. Why must a man ignore his personal safety for that of a woman? Why is it sad that men are not willing to risk their lives for women when women would never do the same? Women have made it clear that they have power in this situation and enough of them have abused it that men are doing the logical thing and staying away. \n\nIf you want to change this, don't ask men to double down on the risks. Ask women to support those who were wrongly accused and to stop abusing the power they have. Or, if they are truly strong and independent, to take it on the chin like men have always done when they are alone and vulnerable.\n\nWhat is truly sad about this is that no one cares when men are the vulnerable ones. But when women are finally treated equal to men, including suffering the way men have always suffered, then and only then do we want to do something about it.\n\n>Bro lmao women are rarely ever believed when raped so that's super funny\n\nOP gave you an example. But like I said, go look at the title IX violations. Moms even had to setup support networks for their sons because of false accusations.\n\nLook at the Depp Vs Heard case. Look how much evidence he had to come with to try to clear his name. She just made an accusation with no evidence and his career was ruined. It is false to claim women are never believed. Women are almost always believed first. If the genders were reversed, would a drunk man be taken seriously if he said his female coworker was inappropriate with him?\n\nWomen are taken so seriously, companies pay out millions to accusers and have to establish strict policies for sexual harassment. Look at how sexual misconduct is handled at schools when the teacher is male Vs female. A female student can ruin a male teacher's life with an accusation alone. Female teachers get slaps on their wrists and the media will call it a \"relationship\".\n\n>most cops throw away rape kits, these are stats you can google anywhere by the way.\n\nBecause most of the rape kits are useless. They don't actually prove a rape happened. Additionally, they don't have the money to test them. You want them to test the rape kits more often? Pay more taxes. But that means you cannot defund the police. The barrier here is not sexism but practicality. A witness or text or video evidence is much stronger in proving a crime is committed.\n\n>Most rapist don't face any real consequences anyway so.\n\nThis is unprovable. In order to be proved a rapist you need to go to court and the judge needs to find you guilty. This is like saying most thieves face no consequences. Maybe, but how do we know who is stealing without investigation and proof? An accusation alone is not enough to prove someone stole something.\n\nBut even if you were to claim that these rapists are sneakily getting away with it, then perhaps we need to investigate the accusations or claims more closely.\n\nAccording the CDC, women are now [raping men as much as men are raping women.](https://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers/). It is also legal for an adult woman to get child support from a rape she committed, which resulted in a pregnancy. Including if her victim was a minor. So the ones who seem to be getting away with rape are women.\n\nPerhaps we need a rethink on things like accusations, who is really harming who and how we approach issues such as rape and sexual assault when women are the perpetrators.",

It was your responsibility when you decided how much you were going to drink, and/or did not get help for conditions that took control away from your ability to do that like being an alcoholic.\n\nObviously someone getting drugged doesn't fit under this, and when possible those people should be helped, but if you don't think it's gonna be problematic to turn some roofied girl/guy over to the cops who might have been assaulted and implicate you in all of that, then you've got rude awakening coming your way.",

I could sense where that was going so i tell her that I am getting her some ibuprofen and a big glass of water and she's going to bed and Im going back down to the bar. i got out of there as fast as i could and head back downstairs.\n  \nthe next day, she basically told me she appreciated me \"not taking advantage of the situation like a lot of guys would\". i was glad i helped her out, but man, I opened myself up to a potential shitstorm by trying to do the right thing. in retrospect, i should have helped her but had another coworker (one of the other female coworkers) go with us. cant be too careful about things like that. it ended up fine but things could have gone very badly for me, and very badly for her if someone less scrupulous had taken her up there.",

Also said person might end up in jail for public intoxication.  Best to just not get involved unless the person is a trusted close friend.\n\nFriend of friend, coworker, or complete stranger?  Probably don't even bother unless you're in a crowded area, then tell the bartender or some authority figure at the venue.  Don't ever leave or be alone with said person.  Classmate in college got fucked by that after rebuffing some chick's advances because she had the hots for him (friend of friend) at a party then she followed him out of the party.  \n\nIt's really not on you to make sure others are safe, it's not your burden or duty.  It's nice if you can but, don't single yourself out either.  Keep in mind there's probably a few other people that witnessed it and this person acted of their own volition to put themselves in that situation generally.  Assuage yourself of guilt for not acting.  Again, feels horrible to type it out though.\n\nLots of people disagree with this view and statement IRL, what if they were drugged, etc.  No real good answers to it unfortunately, everything sucks about the situation.",

A reasonable person could have concerns about those facts, and reporting it to HR would be an acceptable course of action. Equally acceptable is HR choosing to open an investigation into whether an employee has raped another employee after leaving from an official work function.

And what about the statement \u201cthey have a witness who saw me put a drunk coworker into my car\u201d suggests to you that they\u2019re concerned about consensual sex? Make no mistake - they\u2019re investigating whether or not OP assaulted his co-worker.\n\n>\tAnd, about the sexual harassment? They\u2019d have a case in the capital of misogyny known as Israel (Israeli with severe PTSD here).\n\nAgain, the situation as far as anyone knows pre-investigation is that OP was seen leaving with a co-worker he barely knows and who was drunk enough to be vomiting. That is not a person who can consent to sex. So the general guidelines and laws as they relate to this situation would suggest that an investigation into whether an employee has raped another employee, especially after leaving an official work function, is warranted. If that\u2019s misogyny to you, great. Personally, I think it would be more misogynistic for HR to refuse to investigate when an employee is suspected of committing sexual assault, but we\u2019re all entitled to our opinions.\n\n>\tAre you a lawyer?

It's like saying you breathe air to exercise your lungs, not to ingest oxygen.\n\nThe requirements to cover your ass are you isolate all involved people from the evidence and then determine what information you have available from the parties or on your own to make this assessment.\n\nThis generally includes things like investigating communications between the parties and from the parties to other third parties related to this incident and determining what the risk of retaining either or both employees is.\n\nAt that point you might request any further evidence from both parties again if they have unresolved claims.  If it becomes a legal matter at any point during this, you better have already brought legal in to participate.  If you fail to do this, and a party has to involve legal before HR does, there's a good chance someone from HR is getting fired as a part of all of this.  If there are claims of illegal activity between co-workers this has definitely already reached that threshold.",

Like virtually everything legal related it heavily depends on specific case facts.\n\nHe is definitely suspended on the grounds that he has been accused of sexual misconduct of some kind.  This is definitely putting the company in a place where they are in danger of accusing him of this conduct without evidence beyond testimony of another employee that he did this.  Likewise if it his statements are true and he has evidence to contest this claim he should make a statement (with his lawyer looking it over first) to that effect.  If he believes it is a false statement he should state that as well.  If the company continues to treat him in this way it is a clear accusation that he has engaged in the conduct.  This is very problematic for the company.  Org legal generally will become HR's worse nightmare in this scenario.\n\nIf these are all true it is also wise to probably recommend that you will only meet with HR if they have a representative from legal present.  This is kind of a nuclear option with HR as there are a lot of legal landmines in what they do and this creates the situation that they are very likely to make themselves a bigger problem than you and they know that.  On top of this due to the legal impact to the company associated with this, legal will WANT to be a part of this.\n\nFun management fact: Anything legal wants to be a part of that HR is doing is not going well for HR.",

Once you give them a reason that's not based on performance, you are opening yourself up to liability even if you are in an \"at-will\" state. Simply state that \"we no longer require their expertise\" or \"no longer meeting our expectations\" and move on.",

It's not the companies place to do that. And then to suspend someone via email? If they are worried OP might be a danger an email is a weird way to tell them to get out.\n\nAlso what is OP being accused of? Standard \"natural justice\" is to know the allegation so you can respond to it. Not a fishing expedition of \"what did you do after the party\".\n\nBut I'm really hung-up on how you just \"move\" a hardwired rear dashcam to the front. It took me hours to install mine. That's really not something you can so a quick switcheroo on!\n\nMore holes than a sieve.",

All he needs to do is present the video evidence. More than likely, HR would have dropped the whole issue after seeing the video. If they still wanted to accuse OP of something, *then* it would make sense to shut up and have his Lawyer do the talking. But right now, he doesn't even have to say anything, so he's basically choosing the long road instead of the short road for no discernable reason.\n\nThe video evidence would be the first thing presented in court anyway, so there's no harm in just showing it now.",

The first responders quickly decided she wasnt in danger and began to leave. boss man asked what she was on\r  \n\r  \n\"WHAT DID YOU FIND IN HER PURSE?!\" the paramedics refused to divulge. citing privacy laws.\r  \n\r  \nThe boss was now fuming. He declared that my ex must be taken to LabCorp for U.A. immediately.\r  \n\r  \nThe plan was simple, my exes male boss was to drive her to LabCorp. Ex had other ideas.\r  \n\r  \nIn her impaired state she was still quick enough to refuse the ride from him. declaring loudly that she wasn't comfortable being in a car in a car with a man, whilst she could hardly stay awake. Boss was quick to get the message, subsequently backing off.\r  \n\r  \n\"Who then? WHO!\" her peers exclaimed.\r  \n\r  \nthe office rumbled with excitement.\r  \n\r  \nHer co-workers stood around her trying to ascertain the situation. Entertained yet concerned.\r  \n\r  \nShe informed me later on that she had been franticly calling my phone since the fiasco began.( I was asleep like a trash person. )\r  \n\r  \nFemale co worker's began offering rides. \"NO! I want my fianc\u00e9 to take me!\" she exclaimed.\r  \n\r  \nfinally I awoke from a deep mid day slumber. my phone vibrating wildly.\r  \n\r  \n\"I will lose my job if you aren't here in 20 min! Work wants urine analysis! like NOW! Get synthetic urine and come Save me!!\"\r  \n\r  \nI rubbed my eyes. the house was eerily silent WTF?!\r  \n\r  \nConfused I sprang to my feet, already dressed in last weeks clothes. I fumbled around the room for my keys in a hazy panic. Her job was our only income at that time. The money she earned supported our two kids, and myself. the prospect of her getting fired swirled around in my head.\r  \n\r  \nmy own voice echoed in my mind\r  \n\r  \n\"My god, what will we do??\"\r  \n\r  \nBefore I realized, I was halfway there. Stopped at the head shop, grabbed the synthetic urine. I ushered the teller on like a madman.\r  \n\r  \n\"TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE\"\r  \n\r  \nI was greeted by suspicious stares as I pulled into her office parking lot. The doors burst open and she came sprinting.\r  \n\r  \nI got her to the lab\r  \n\r  \nDrug test.\r  \n\r  \nshe tested clean. (with synthetic urine)\r  \n\r  \nI saved her job.\r  \n\r  \nShe still has the job till this day.",

Being a victim is better regarded in our society than most \"embarrassing\" behaviors, especially sexual ones.  Due to the way these things escalate, a woman with no intentions of making false accusations can find herself in a slippery slope of doing just that by trying to deny the latter and appearing to be the former.\n\nI actually know multiple women who have implied something along the lines of \"i was taken advantage of while drunk\", because they were sexual with a person they normally wouldn't have been sexual with while sober.  Luckily, they all walked back such accusations and admitted they were just embarrassed, and made sure no reputational damage was done.  Most of the women I'm referring to are smart, ethical people too; they still found themselves in that situation and made that mistake.\n\nIf you're a partier in general like I was, you've likely been in a situation where you tried to avoid blame for doing something stupid by pointing fingers at others in a knee-jerk reaction.  Hopefully we come to our senses and realize we are in the wrong, but some people don't, especially when peer pressure comes into play.  And when sex is involved, it all escalates way too fast, and all emotions are magnified.",

Seems like none of them have standing to report a crime based on giving a person a ride & nothing else... and why would HR tell you to make a statement, rather than the police themselves?\n\nFurther, if it was a company event where the employee overindulged, the company itself could potentially be liable for getting an employee too drunk & then causing an accident or being unable to consent (the former from the state, the latter from a lawsuit). I was an HR employee for multiple companies for 12 years, & still work closely with them... no way would we have called the cops over a non-crime (esp without talking to the alleged victim employee). There would need to be something more alleged than just giving a ride.\n\nIf true, though, I do wish you luck! Sounds like you should find another place to work, though.",

But here's what he said:\n\n>I received an email today, telling me to make a statement for the police and that I'm suspended until the case is dismissed. I'm pissed.

They'll just tell him there's no case, and any threat now has no teeth.\n\nThere's also no way to \"submit a statement to the police\" like that - they'll bring you in for questioning on an active case, with your attorney, but they don't just accept statements from random people walking through the door. If he was a person of interest in an active investigation, he wouldn't be hearing about it from HR, and if he wasn't, I don't know who he \"submitted his statement\" to, but it wasn't the police, and his attorney is not a real attorney or they would have advised him as such.\n\nSomeone's not gonna do all that work with the cameras unless they've been accused before, or are close to someone who has been, so that was somewhat unbelievable, but I could make my peace with it.\n\nHR doing all this either on a complaint from a 3rd party, but not involving the actual alleged \"victim\" or not making it clear that the victim is involved in the complaint is exceptionally strange, but if HR is grossly incompetent and corrupt and doing this because their buddy is asking for a favor, that's not the strangest thing I've ever heard. I can make my peace with that, too.\n\nYou'd think he'd bring up the cameras to the company in the first place, long before it reached this point. But I can deal with that, too.\n\nBut the stuff with the police, and an actual attorney not pointing out the massive holes in what's going on, is a bridge too far. This is totally made up.",

The advice in this comment thread is really terrible don't go making matters worse by listening to some of the nonsense high in the comments here.\n\nFirst and foremost when there is a complainant involving \"inappropriate\" behavior which could be some type of sexual harassment, or worse, you absolutely suspend the person being investigated. If no wrong doing is found, you are brought back and paid for the time you were suspended, which is the case almost always. Whether is it legally owed depends on a lot of factors.\n\nWe're missing a lot of details here. I don't understand why any sort of statement is being made to the police or why the police are involved at all. The only reason would be if a crime is reported to have taken place or suspected to have. My gut tells me that the individual who OP gave the ride home made a complaint after blacking out and being told weeks later she in fact was not driven home by an Uber.\n\nWhat are the details of the complaint outside of \"inappropriate\"? I certainly could see this complain as being \"OP drove me home drunk and recorded me in this compromised state without my knowledge or consent\". This also makes the police report make sense to me as well. Which if that is the complaint, you are very likely fucked. \n\nWhat can you actually do to protect yourself here? \n\n1) Get the full nature of whatever this complaint is.\n\n2) Ask in writing about being compensated for the suspension when this misunderstanding is resolved.\n\n3) Beat HR to the follow up whenever you are asked questions which allows you to dictate the narrative - Like a following up emailing saying this is what I said, and you said. \n\n4) I would give some thought to if you have been acting differently towards or communicating more frequently with this coworker you barely knew for three years.

          "text": "It\u2019s really fucking weird honestly to record that much. I\u2019ve given tons of people rides even drove for Uber and never a single issue, seems kinda made up. Not that it couldn\u2019t happen, but the way it\u2019s told seems off.  Like what someone thinks might happen in that situation vs what would actually happen. \n\nDoes remind me of this funny as fuck story that happened to me. I worked in an office and was one of two dudes in there, there were however 9 women who worked there. We\u2019d get shit often for being the only dudes but it was all in fun. Nothing inappropriate ever happened besides some jokes but it was one of those places everyone laughed no one took offense. \n\nMost nights I was the closer because I hated getting up early and would rather come in at 10am than 7am. I usually closed with just me and another lady J.  She was about 10 years older than me so in her late 30\u2019s or very early 40\u2019s and a lesbian so we would talk all sorts of dirty shit and occasionally the manager would walk by on his way out and be like OH MY GOD!! And we\u2019d laugh about it while she made fun of him in Spanish (she was Hispanic). \n\nNow a relevant piece of information is J used to be FAT. Like super fat 400+lbs at 5\u20193 or so. She had gastric bypass surgery and lost a bunch of weight, but she was still pretty over weight. She was closer to 200lbs or so if I had to guess at that point. \n\nWe were good friends as far as coworkers go. Every once in a while we\u2019d get out of work late and she\u2019d have to call an Uber to get her to the train station rather than walk so she didn\u2019t miss her train. J didn\u2019t drive at the time. One day we are swamped at work and don\u2019t get out of there until really late. She tries to get an Uber but her train is leaving before the Uber will get to our work, so she\u2019s going to miss her train. Then she will have to wait over an hour and won\u2019t get home until super late. She asks me \u201ccan you drop me off at the train station?\u201d\n\nNow this isn\u2019t a problem for me as it\u2019s a short drive like under 10 minutes and we\u2019re friends. Of course I have no problem giving her a ride to the train station. The problem? I was driving a new Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel with a 6 inch lift sitting on 37\u201d tires. On the weekends I like to camp out in the desert so I need the big tires (and the lift to fit the tires) to be able to get to where I camp. The issue was... I hadn\u2019t had the truck long so I didn\u2019t have running boards. I\u2019m a big guy and could just jump into the truck no problem. For my 5\u20193 over weight coworker? Yeah... she couldn\u2019t get in it. She says no worries we will figure it out. \n\n2 minutes later we are in the parking lot. I\u2019m trying to help her into my truck because she\u2019s no where close to getting in alone. She\u2019s wearing a shorter spring dress (we live in the south west) which I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s helping or hurting. She\u2019s got 1 leg up on the inside and the other on the ground and I\u2019m trying to help her up. She\u2019s going just push my butt. I was like uhh that feels inappropriate. She\u2019s like this isn\u2019t sexual I need to make my train I start lifting her butt and her dress is riding up. At this point my hands on her bare ass and she\u2019s got a thong in. I\u2019m like I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m sorry and she\u2019s like just grab my ass and lift its fine. Grab my ass grab my ass grab my ass. With legit 2 handfuls of her ass we get her in the truck and off we go. She makes her train and all is good. \n\nThe next morning I get to work and my manager asks to see me. He\u2019s playing the video surveillance of me trying to get her in my truck and her just screaming \u201cit\u2019s fine grab my ass, I know you like girls with big butts\u201d. He looks at me and goes \u201cwhat the fuck\u201d before he breaks out in laughter just dying. He\u2019s like I saw that shit when I got in here and I couldn\u2019t believe it. He hands me a 12 ounce redbull (I love redbulls) and goes \u201cthanks for being a team player\u201d. I go to my desk and get to work. I tell J and she\u2019s like fuck it I made my train (nothing is going to get to her). \n\nIt gets even better because after lunch the manager makes a run to get stuff for the office. When he gets back he has a step stool he puts in her cubicle and goes \u201cjust in case you need a ride again\u201d. I nearly fell out of my fucking chair, tears rolling down my face losing it. It was pure comedic gold. She looks at him and goes \u201cthanks... I mean I still got in but this would have been nice\u201d.",

She told me the thing about beards and porn, and I obviously said I didn't do it (since I didn't do it). \n\nShe kept insisting it had to be me, because I was the only employee with a beard. I said someone was either outright lying about me, or perhaps it was one of our many other locations in the city and that it's messed up to accuse me like that. \n\nShe then backpedaled and said \"no one accused you of anything. I was ASKING if you did it.  If I was accusing you of it, you'd have been fired already. So last chance before we look into it - did you do it or have anything to do with it?\"\n\n\nI mean if I could be accused of spreading pornography based only on something as vague as a customer saying \"a bearded guy was giving out nudes of me\", I have no doubts that I'd be in a lot more shit if I'd taken a drunk coworker home on camera and had nothing to back up the fact that we didn't have sex afterwards (whether forced or consensual).

Several years ago a false allegation was leveled at a friend of mine.  It was completely fabricated.  No criminal charges were filed in the city / state it happened due to a lack of evidence a crime had been committed. However, he is an officer in the military and had to go to trial to defend himself.  Had he lost he could have gone to military prison.  The court sided with him and the case was dismissed but it was a difficult process, simply based on an allegation.  Like I said, maybe living in CA has skewed my perception but running the dash cam seems perfectly normal. Having dash cams is more normal now because people are shady af with insurance claims too\u2026 again maybe just a CA thing.",

The issue with domestic violence situations like this is that they are extremely hard to disentangle due to a phenomenon called \"reactive abuse\" where the *abused* victim will actually begin to demonstrate abusive behavior against their abuser. The Abuser will then often use that abuse as evidence that they are the innocent party. In situations like that bystanders should be extremely careful about deciding guilt before both parties have been able to present their case.",

The degree to which people are scrutinizing these events is unavoidable, but it is also something that the human brain is just not meant to deal with.

                                  "text": "That is a hard question. Open trials are generally a good thing because it keeps the proceedings more honest. It is a lot harder to railroad people if the trial record is easy to see. On the other hand a vast majority of trials are not going to get any scrutiny regardless, and that benefit is limited.\n\nFor the case of celebrity or high profile trials you just end up with *too much* scrutiny, but there is not really a way to reduce that without cause. In some cases it can lead to harassment and ruining people's lives.\n\nPeople are just way less reasonable than they think they are. The trial of Kyle Rittenhouse is a really good example of that. Prior to watching the trial and researching the statutes I will admit that I was pretty sure he was guilty just based on the circumstances, but the prosecution absolutely failed to prove that at trial. It ended the way it was should have legally. However, his exoneration was so widely publicized that people have had really bad takes on what it means in a larger cultural context, effectively seeing it as a *moral* victory and not a legal one. While he definitely acted in self defense, he unarguably created the situation that resulted in that, and was obviously prepared for it when it happened. He was not guilty of murder, but that does not mean he is a hero or even that he is \"innocent.\" (Courts only find \"not guilty\" rather than innocent, as the burden is on the prosecution.)\n\nBut due to the coverage you basically just got a bunch of echo chambers of people pushing themselves to the most extreme edge opinions on the subject. For some he was a representation of how unjust society is for whole classes of people, and for others he was an example about how all the protests were actually violent \"ANTIFA\" actions and that they were right all along. He should not serve either of those narratives, as he was just an individual who did something colossally dumb, and had to defend himself to get out of it.\n\nSo I am not sure. I think I lean on the side of them being open because the potential harm from closed trials is I think larger than the potential gain for those with high profile cases, but it is so easy to see how badly people interact with the legal system from a media standpoint.",

He was formally charged at the conclusion of the interview and arraigned the following morning. If my memory serves me right, I think he did 2 years for an armed robbery he didn't commit before being released after the discovery of new evidence.\n\nSure, he won a lawsuit for an obscene amount of money, but think of all the people that never get the new evidence brought to light.

First and foremost: if OP *had* hired an attorney, the first thing they would have been told OP is \"Do not talk about this situation with others and *definitely* do not post about the situation.\" Secondly, I don't think Uber drivers drivers just drive away without any sort of communication. How would the driver know that was their passenger? OP says this was a party, so it doesn't sound like they were the only people around. Thirdly, *why* would *your HR* tell you to report a non-crime to the police when they haven't otherwise been involved whatsoever? [u/australiaisok](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ugikep/comment/i702xv3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) brings up several other points (as do others in the thread).\n\nAdditionally, based on OP's [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HeyItsYonder), I am a bit skeptical of their version of reality. Here are some lowlights:\n\n* Demonstrating an impressive lack of understanding of what [consent is](https://twitter.com/HeyItsYonder/status/1277305803720933377?cxt=HHwWgoCmxY2387kjAAAA).\n* Showcasing their ignorance related to [covid-19 (and mask wearing)](https://twitter.com/HeyItsYonder/status/1276958462291742720?cxt=HHwWgMCgnZa91bgjAAAA). [Part II](https://twitter.com/HeyItsYonder/status/1276932641724354561?cxt=HHwWgsCmgZzeybgjAAAA) (I'm sure there are many options to choose from).\n* Pretending [Trump didn't sharpie](https://twitter.com/HeyItsYonder/status/1270469377897279488?cxt=HHwWgMCh-d_KzqEjAAAA) on the official NWS map.\n* Defending people [running over peaceful protestors](https://twitter.com/HeyItsYonder/status/1269591317337632770?cxt=HHwWhMCj_fKkv54jAAAA).\n* OP tweeting about *their current employer* that some of their colleagues have [personal hygiene issues](https://twitter.com/HeyItsYonder/status/1248532471794126848?cxt=HHwWgMCi_eDq1tMiAAAA).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf OP's story is in fact legitimate, I will absolutely delete the above comment and will apologize for sowing doubt (and for minimizing/questioning the intentional steps you took to protect yourself and your colleague). But based on what OP has provided (and what they haven't provided), this feels pretty damn suspect.",

If she says you groped her at the door and you obviously got out to \"help\" her, then it'll look bad. It would also be helpful if you prove that you contacted an Uber. I think the app has a history you can look at, but Uber will be able to verify that a driver at least drove up, either way. \n\nIdk who needs to hear this, but if you stumble across an incapacitated coworker then you need to *immediately* find somebody to help *you* help them. I'd have called the cops and let them deal with her before offering her a ride with me alone in my car, much less messing with my cameras so that it'd be obvious that I understood how bad it might look...\n(edit: I'd personally never put a person in a taxi/uber, either.

I secretly hope the only people at this point that know about the video is your lawyer and because the more the other side is confident about their case against you, the more they will experience shock. Im also not a lawyer just going on a hunch.\n\n**Next, record any public profiles this woman has on facebook, instagram and so on, NOW and before her lawyer tells her to remove any such content. Go back to the day it happened, look for anything to suggest you are being slandered, even implied. Record with video screencast or screen record.\n\nSee if friends of hers are doing or making such comments and record those.\n\nPrime suspect to identify is the witness that saw you. THAT person is either jealous or did not like you before that celebration day or started/made the original rumor to contribute to the office political narrative (some power struggle). Get evidence (online) or email exchanges that may exist or people have offered you.\n\nBOTH of these people you can absolutely sue for damage to reputation, stress and anxiety. Ensure you also meet with a psych to address the stress and which will be used to support that this is indeed a traumatic experience.\n\nI cant stress enough to identify a lawyer that has a solid track record, has demonstrated examples of similar cases he/she has handled.  Reread that last sentence. If you do a full search now for one in your area and identify someone better, I personally would change lawyers.\n\nWhat a horrific, horrific experience.

No then someone is projecting and needs a slap!! \n\nThis sadly though is a classic case of HR protecting the company and being willing to throw anyone under a bus for their own narrative. \nBe prepared for a quick end to this so work out what a serious financial apology from your company looks like and a glowing reference. Get the CV up to date as you may not be going back there. \nAdd a clause that states any defamation after you leave will be met with public refutation and financial compensation (had this once and did the trick). Anyone who tried to throw mud after I left got censured and in one case dismissed. \n\nBest of luck!",

The problem is that a lot of people\u2019s ethical compass is absolutely screwed in the modern world. \n\nI say this as someone whose job currently involves Human Resources. It\u2019s not my absolute main job (there\u2019s a legit HR department) but I effectively have to do all the leave tracking for my team, field interpersonal complaints, and occasionally deal with sexual harassment (which gets escalated to legit HR) as part of my admin role. \n\nTo that end\u2026\n\nI designed a spreadsheet to track the different types of leave more easily for me. Has a nice running tally feature. \n\nPeople accused me of cheating them when i started denying leave requests, when I\u2019m following the contract (and apparently previous people hadn\u2019t noticed or tracked as \u201cdiligently\u201d). \n\nThat doesn\u2019t make me an asshole; I\u2019m just doing my job. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m NOT concerned about the continued smooth operation of this company; it\u2019s literally in my job description.\n\nRedditors hate HR because they don\u2019t know that difference.

However, I think the HR department has done right here (assuming you are being paid while suspended).\n\nHR have a responsibility to investigate any claims to ensure the safety of the work place. You know you did nothing wrong but the HR team don't. HR haven't said you're innocent or guilty, they're just investigating.\n\nNaturally, while investigating they would need to suspend you. If claims like this were found to be true and you had been allowed to stay at work, they would have been putting other employees at risk.\n\nWhat I find strange is that you have evidence that you are innocent and you haven't shared it with HR. Should this situation end in the worst for you, the fact that you withheld evidence from the investigation will go against you in court. It could come across like you did so just to get money out of your employer.\n\nWhy not just share the videos so you can go back to work?",

Since you literally just gave her a ride home, you've done nothing illegal and did not breach any workplace rules.\n\nBy intentionally hiding the evidence, you've just **created** a more serious problem for yourself. With video evidence, you don't even need an attorney. If the video shows you helping her out of the car and then getting back into the car a few minutes later and driving home, then you're in the clear. If HR sees the video and still wants to accuse you of something, then you can hire an attorney to go after *them* for whatever it is they're trying to pull.\n\nThis childish game of cat & mouse that you're playing is idiotic. I used to work in insurance (auto claims) and would have customers pull the same crap. They would say \"*I have a video of the accident*\". I would ask for it and they'd say \"*I'll show it in court\"*. \n\nBut......if you show it to me now, WE WON'T HAVE TO GO TO COURT! \\*facepalm",

Again, I worked in insurance and dealt with this on a daily basis. This is not my opinion. These are just facts.\n\nEDIT: Also, most property damage claims never even go to court. They go to *arbitration.* There is no in-person hearing, and no judge. So it's a complete waste of time to '*hold your cards'* because there will never even be a criminal aspect to the case. The insurance companies basically just send a few emails back and forth and the case is closed.",

Ended up a week later I got called in for inappropriate sexual comments at work. They'd just invited me out to eat w/ them outside of work days prior too!

Is he doing it because he was worried? Or because hes an asshole? \n\nI mean if you reported someone to hr you\u2019d want them to ask questions, I do believe the husband probably was over stepping but that\u2019s what hr is there for, to protect its employees from harm, harassment, sounds like you and this guy are deciding on the nuclear way to solve this problem lol. \n\nHr had one side of a story, op could have easily proved his side of the story but decided not to. Sexual assault is a serious thing, being black out drunk and not knowing what happened to you is a scary thing. \n\nIdk idk this is a giant fucking dumpster fire in my opinion a dumpster fire.\n\nI do hope OP gets the husband in trouble for all the headache the man caused.",

Collisions and other adverse events are also forensically studied if serious enough. These cases deal in facts, not feelings. But also, its pretty normal to have dashcams in vehicles for a similar purpose.\n\nThe risk of false allegations is an external threat where an individual's conduct, despite being honourable and just (ie not talking about predatory or unsavory behaviour) is largely ignored if a woman raises the allegation against a man (or a woman is seen to be victimised by a man in OPs case) and such allegations are supported by sexist laws which define women as a protected segment of society. This is a risk which you have no way of seeing, unless you disengage with all non-related females. You never know what someone is thinking or how they may think in future. Or in OPs case, how a third party viewing his well intentioned and honourable act may perceive it.\n\nThe men's perspective is also minimised or ignored through lower levels of courts (civil or tribunal, such as those on university campuses, HR fallout or \"damage\" claims for monetary benefit) where the standard of proof is on the balance of probabilities vs beyond  reasonable doubt. They deal in feelings, not facts and unless you can provide incontrovertible evidence (such as a video or audio recording), you are less than likely to succeed. \n\nSimilarly in criminal courts, particularly regarding historical allegations of sexual abuse, where there is no physical evidence to rely upon, a man is at a significant disadvantage without said incontrovertible evidence. This doesnt even require a conviction to be laid for significant harm to come to the respondent, the process of defending against the allegations is long and arduous, leaving mental and emotional scarring for years afterwards and the \"aggrieved\" is almost never held accountable for their lies.\n\nIf you are familiar with risk matrices, the likelihood of occurance is but one factor in determining a risk rating to an event. The damage caused by the event and the strategies to negate or minimise loss in the event occurring are also significant factors, which usually have greater weight attached to them. In this case, I would say the incidence rate of this is low for the most part, but the psychological, financial and potential cost of personal freedoms are significantly high enough to ensure risk mitigation techniques are required in almost all circumstances. You may call recording creepy, and it can be if used in that manner, but in OPs use case, it is both necessary and desirable to take these actions to safeguard himself and also the woman he was assisting (remember this incident is a spurious claim made by the womans ex husbands mate and her reputation is at stake also). \n\nIts unfortunate, but in today's society where men are looked upon unfavourablely more often than not, recording equipment is as necessary for personal safety as a harness is for a worker at height or an airbag in a car. You may think it is \"creepy\" or over the top, but that shows you either have vested interest in men being vulnerable to such allegations or you are so woefully naieve to think its not threatening enough to someone to need to manage risk for. In either case, your position is not justified and your comments about it being \"creepy\" are nothing more than denigrating the need for men to protect themselves from such occurrances.",

Am assuming a statement from the lady you gave a ride to.\n\nAnother thing to consider is whomever has laid the accusation was in the car park at the same time, so you want to request any and all security camera footage for at least the night in question be handed over to police as evidence.\n\nIf you want to jump down a rabbit hole and see how far it goes, statements about the party from the female co-worker and any of her friends who were with her. It may be that you actually intercepted her prior to your accuser doing something nefarious. While it would be nice to say that is far fetched it's a possibility, so knowing if anyone was plying her with drinks may well be pertinent later on and if someone was enabling her to become drunk, having testimony of who it was may well help your defense.\n\nEDIT : changed the description of the female co-worker who was taken home",

Adjusted the angle? Record walking her inside on a phone? Why even claim these things so specifically in the post? Sounds either made up by some incel, or some guy trying to defend himself knowing he did something fucked up while driving a drunk coworker home, just making up the part about the recordings.)\n\nMaybe I'm just cynical, but really, statistically speaking... And honestly, who says \"Little does the company know I protected myself with dashcam footage as well as a short cell phone video of me walking her to the house. I am innocent and will fight this.\"\n\nI mean if it's true I'm really happy the guy has video proof (even though word against word would still mean he would never get into any trouble even without video proof.

I declined, called a taxi (company was paying for those anyway for drunk partygoers) and I left it at that. I spent the entire evening by myself perched under security cameras to make sure I was trackable.\n\nBrought into HR for not giving her a ride home. After explaining why, they suspended me again while \"investigating\", and suddenly when I was brought back I didnt have a final written warning and my record was nice and clean.\n\nMoral of story, as cruel as it is, no one at any job is your friend.

If I thought a male colleague was plying a woman with drink to get her drunk then take her home, or felt suspicious in any way I would intervene at the time and get her home myself. I\u2019m a woman who has had lifts home before from male colleagues, just me and him in the car. It\u2019s a kind gesture, but you\u2019ll rightly never give a colleague a lift ever again.

But in fact it's actually a very human thing that cases like these pop up because it's people deliberately trying to abuse the systems in place. \n\nI generally don't have to deal with things like this because I work at smaller companies where things are more or less generally fairly straightforward but I did remember one case when I was an apprentice mechanic at a dealership. The dealership was part of a larger company but the location itself only had about 10 employees in total. I was apprenticing through a program my trade school had with various companies but many of my classmates were hired in the same company after their internship period ended. They didn't keep me and I didn't mind much because I had a few other options. I kept in contact with some people though and to this day still drop by every now and then to chat. It was on one of those visits last summer that I learned, almost two years after having left that company, that I'd been suspected of stealing based on something someone saw in security footage. Thing is, I never stole anything, and nobody at the time even came to talk to me or ask me anything. Even when I heard of this the dude who told me refused to elaborate further but he seemed to believe that I did steal something. Honestly I didn't feel good hearing this but ultimately it doesn't matter. \n\nI'd hate to have to watch my back constantly and have to always think of ways to cover for myself every day but I guess it's a good habit and good on you for making sure you're covered.",

Awful that you can't offer help but similarly awful that it ultimately comes down to who is friends with the boss\n\nEdit: I haven't phrased this particularly articulately - I hope you know I'm not comparing you directly to that situation, just that it comes down to office politics in terms of who is believed",

First, be wary of offering help. Second, make sure there are witnesses, if they are female, even better. GREAT idea with the cameras and even the cell phone video. Genius. Record everything and always assume you are being recorded. \n\nIMO, this isn\u2019t a fuck up, but I hope people can learn from your experience. \n\nGood luck!

Getting yourself cleared in a court of law gives you added leverage if the company tries to pull any funny business in retaliation, which it shouldn't, as HR is there to protect the company.  \nIt's like saying \"Why didn't you tell this to the police officer?\"  Because you don't tell the cops a fucking thing, they are never there to help you, they're just there to collect evidence they can use against you.",
