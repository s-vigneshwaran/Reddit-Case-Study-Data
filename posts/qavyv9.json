  "text": "TIFU by smelling my feet and ending up in the ER\nThis TIFU actually happened today! Or at least in the last 24 hours, either way I\u2019m counting it. \n\nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that my feet are sometimes a little bit smelly. Some of my friends and family have lovingly said they are \u201codorly challanged\u201d. I wash them in the shower every day, I\u2019ve tried the fancy creams, but none of it seems to really help and I\u2019ve at this point accepted that I\u2019m just naturally a stinkfoot and will live my life with a constant faint corn chip aroma wafting from my toes.\n\nI live alone, and when in my apartment prefer not to wear socks or shoes. This is occasionally a point of contention with my girlfriend, who visits often and insists I at least wear socks when she comes over. Its mostly fun banter where she teases me for my feet smelling and I tease her for a loud burp or something like that, but sometimes after a particularly long day the foot factory releases emissions that would surely get me fined by EPA, which she rightfully hates. \n\nYesterday she came over for dinner. It was a nice day so we decided to get delivery from one of our favorite restaurants and eat on the balcony. Well, I\u2019m at home and I\u2019ve already liberated my tootsies from their foot prisons, and I figured it\u2019d be nice to set the table with some flowers for my lady. I was outside setting up when she arrived, and she came outside to greet me. IMMEDIATELY she smelled my feet and recoiled in disgust. The most dramatic reaction ever. Fake vomiting, fake crying, she was hamming it up as part of our banter. I HAVE gone a bit nose blind to them over the years, so I lean against the railing to balance and go to smell them myself to see how bad they were. This was my mistake. I\u2019m a burly guy, and this poor railing could not handle my equally overdramatic reaction of throwing my head back and screaming. It gave way.\n\nLuckily I\u2019m only on the second floor, so I only fell maybe 25 feet, but it felt like it lasted a solid minute. It was at least long enough of a fall for me to reflect on the situation and feel like an idiot for dying from smelling my own feet. The aftermath is a fractured rib and dislocated shoulder, and my girlfriend never letting me live this down. \n\nTL;DR: smelled my feet, railing went yeet, almost died and I feel like sheet.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit: Okay guys, I appreciate the foot health advice but please stop PMing me weird remedies. I\u2019m not going to pee on them or soak them in a tomato-bleach medley. I will go back to to the doctor though once I\u2019m all healed up!",

They won't be noticeably darker, but they will seal up your pores and ducts enough to control for sweat from accumulating and creating a moist environment for smelly yeast and bacteria. Worked amazing for my brother. Like he did it once, and hasn't needed to do it again and it's been like 10 years.  \n\ntl:dr - soak your feet in tea to tan your toe hide.",

(I have to add that part because we all know there are many religious authorities who are sadly not good or kind.)\n\nAnecdote: the chaplain at my mother's hospice was the #1 most helpful and comforting person to me while my mom was dying. I'm a Christian but I'm also very secular and was struggling with the idea of what was going to happen with my mom. He helped me make peace with her death and find strength to keep going, and he met me where I was without pushing any of his own ideologies on me. There are amazing religious guides out there for people who want them.",

Some people aren't comfortable with therapy or feel they want more spiritual needs met that a priest could meet better, so in those cases, a good priest can fill a similar role a good therapist can fill. A therapist has more specific psychological training, of course. I've had a pretty severe anxiety disorder all my life so trust me, I will never not appreciate the value of a good therapist :)\n\nEdit: I'm actually not sure if you meant I should have just talked to a therapist about my mom's death instead of a chaplain, or if you mean people in general should. I talked to loads of therapists, both during my mom's illness and after her death. Talking to the chaplain met a different, more spiritual need and didn't really replace the therapy. I needed to talk about the death of my mother *a lot* to recover from it, as many people do, so having a couple different therapists *and* a religious person at different points during my grief helped a lot.",

It was super embarrassing to fly with him, because I could smell the foot stench and I knew other people could smell it. \n\nHe actually blamed me for our no sex life.

They never want to give guidance or routine discipline to their kids and even mentioning this on reddit constantly gets me downvoted, like I'm some big dictator. The fact is, parents have the kid version of a person, and need to create routines with them, and a hygiene routine is important for society, so that when they are  adults they have that regular thing going on without much thought. Regular dental hygiene means they get to have their teeth as an adult--maybe for years. Regular washing so they not offensive to those around them. If parents are going to be lax because then themselves would have to do something as example, well, that's another story. By the time a kid is a teen though, even without parental input, he should have learned some of this and put it into practice a little.",

I can smell if he\u2019s anxious from across the room. I can smell what he ate for dinner on his skin a day later. He also took a job on the road recently so his routines are all off. I feel for him and try to comfort him. But he had me pick out a cologne for him the other day and he picked out a bunch of nice things like beard oil and body wash and new deodorant. That\u2019s what I meant initially by my complacency comment. He\u2019s not a slob, he\u2019s just establishing new routines and rediscovering the importance of hygiene for attraction and self confidence purposes.",

On my side, I live in the tropics so bathing once a day is the absolute minimum. Step out of the house and within 10 minutes you'll be sweating. If you go even one day without bathing, pretty much everyone can notice it. People can stink within 4-6 hours since their last bath.\n\nBut yeah, my bad.\n\nBut regardless of whether it is okay to bathe once a day or not, the guy had 7 years of smelly feet that he refused to deal with. **He stank to high heaven to the point where his wife wanted to divorce him**. So yeah, I stand by the manchild comment.",

You don't need to change your sheets monthly, or clean your bathroom weekly/monthly, or vacuum weekly. Really, if you just get anything that rots or is wet in the trash and out, you basically can let everything else just be. Will it look great? Nope, but it's not gonna smell too bad or be too gross.

Sure, It's fine during the honeymoon phase, but I imagine 15 years of it would be tiresome.  \n\nOr maybe OP will win the lotto of relationships and  it'll do the complete opposite and she'll rewire her brain into having a foot stink fetish?   Then if you ever leave her she's gonna be a gender flipped Cinderella story but instead of a glass shoe she's gonna go around whiffing on dudes' feet.  *You will have ruined her for all other men!!!!*  \nFun to think about but super low odds so OP should get this checked out with full funk going on.  \n\nCheck them out now!

At some point I guess they've become synonymous within the international medical community.",

We both regularly just roll off our ankles. We rarely get full blown sprains, but it often hurts a bit. So we use elastic ankle braces at night whenever the pain gets bad. We both rely on the extra mobility there for balance and general walking so we try to avoid braces during the day. My dad didn't walk much until he met my mother so we just all assume it's normal. I've had multiple foot and knee problems requiring medical attention and physio.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to me a few years ago. I finally meet a good friend and go on lots of long walks with him. He's concerned with my flippy dippy ankles and mentions that he's pretty sure it's not normal. I tell him of course it is and his ankles are probably just stiff due to CP. Finally, I have a nasty ankle flip. Snow, heavy backpack, super tired, hole in the sidewalk. The works. It's pretty OK at first but it just keeps getting worse over the next week despite my usual regimen of brace, ice, rest, aspirin. So he takes me to the doctor. Doctor asks if I had any injury, anything unusual. He was the one who ended up telling her about my ankles. She was so excited. Apparently very few people make it undiagnosed to adulthood with ankles that hypermobile.\n\nAnyway, it's kind of too late to fully move to normal ankle movement. But I am trying to be a bit more cautious. And she hooked me up with an awesome heavy duty brace to use whenever I need. But yeah, not really anyone's fault. My parents even had me treated for gait problems as a small child, but I had so many hypermobile joints then that got corrected, I think the doctors just assumed didn't notice my ankles or assumed they would grow out of it.",

I know it's weird, but you may even try some monistat cream.. Yeast infection treatment for lady bits... you can get the monistat 1, 3, 5, 7 which means 1 dose, 3 doses, etc.. Some doses are a capsule and some is a tube of cream, make sure you get the cream... I'd do the 7 day with the biggest tube of cream..\n\nThen you need to get at least 2 if not 3 pairs of shoes and alternate. Label them if you need to, 1/2 and wear 1 on odd days, 2 on even days. You need to have some insoles or something that are cooling and drying! Get good moisture wicking socks as well.\n\nYou need to keep your feet clean dry and cool to assist the meds and get yourself cleared up! Save your home insurance and your ribs from future bumps!

Dilute it enough so it can't get through your protective layer of dead skin. Any single-celled organism living on your skin is dead but there's no harm to you. It's perfect. You don't even need to know what the single-celled trouble maker is. Rubbing alcohol or salt water is the same.\n\nWhy then do we have all these fancy medications? Because for a lot of things, you don't actually want to go scorched earth, nuclear option. If you're going to put something in your body, it has to target the bad organisms and not do too much damage to you or the good organisms inside you. What can be really dangerous is taking these targeted things improperly. Medications have side effects. It's always a trade off between the good effect and the bad. If you won't benefit from the good effect, you're just stressing your body for no reason and possibly impeding its ability to deal with whatever you've got. So don't take antibiotics for a cold or flu, don't take horse de-wormer for covid, don't ingest essential oils for any reason etc. Placebos can be helpful, but should not be anything with side effects. I'm personally a big fan of hot water. It's my secret, never failing cure for homesickness and eating too many marshmallows at camp, lol.",

Results should be pretty noticeable within an hour or two.\n3. Some kind of foot scrubbing pad like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Soapy-Soles-Foot-Scrubber-Massager/dp/B003DLTG2G/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=foot+scrubber+pad&qid=1634604041&sr=8-5) to use with the foot wash.\n\nNone of these are very expensive and should last a month or two of daily use. Maybe double check wit h a podiatrist to make sure there is no fungal infections, but this should absolutely stop any smelling issue you have, especially the antiperspirant (BTW, if your feet start getting too dry, just applying a lotion in the evenings after your feet are cleaned and dried off). You friends and family will thank you.",

              "text": "Scrub them with dish soap twice a day and then apply a lotion. Then wash your shower. Sometimes you can get rid of it and then it just keeps coming back from areas you stand barefoot. That even happens with people with health issues who try to use the foot antifungal sprays who CAN'T scrub them properly then they say those sprays don't work. If you have a dedicated chair for instance where you keep your bare feet on the floor then clean that area too. I wouldn't put you to work cleaning the whole walking area since it shouldn't be dispersing that much; just clean the areas where your feet sit consistently. Maybe get you a pair of slides to walk around the house. As for your shoes they MAY be a lost cause, but soak them in white vinegar for 4 hours then throw them in the wash. Place them open side down over a vent and they'll dry in a couple hours depending on if it's blowing warm or cool. \n\nI have a brother who was one of those guys who figured it was just fine letting soapy water run down his body to clean his feet. He almost killed us in that camper we were staying in and I had to walk him through it. He was embarrassed for a bit since apparently I wasn't the only person who had to mention it to him. I guess the other parties just didn't take the time to do what I did which was get him one on one so he wasn't too shamed by it and explain in detail how to fix the issue.\n\nGood luck man.",

I\u2019m not sure if your feet smell even when dry, which would indicate an actual fungal situation. Like do your feet generally only smell after wearing shoes/socks all day, or sleeping even? Or do they stink ALL the time? Wearing breathable socks and shoes may improve, although some people simply just sweat more on their feet. I\u2019ve also heard of people doing a listerine (yes, the mouth wash) like once a week.\n\nAnyway, if you haven\u2019t tried being more vigilant in keeping your feet dry yet, think about it.

You need shoes that breathe, closed leather boots/shoes are bad if your feet are sweaty, get sweaty fast, or you're in a wet/humid area.\n\n1. Change your socks 3 times daily if you can\n2. Keep them powdered with something safe to you, check with your doctor\n3. Avoid caffeine for a while, while you treat yo' feet (makes your hands and feet sweat in a lot of cases)\n4. Pull the soles of your shoes out and let them air out, I prop mine in the heel of my shoes/boots\n5. Scrub your feet well, trim your claws \ud83e\udd9e\n6. Treat you and your lady to a foot spa day, if you can\n7. Swap shoes out daily, if you can, I have 3x pair of boots, shoes and dress shoes for this reason. Do it over time, don't break the bank\n8. If you feel your feet are dry or you're getting heat spots, try turning your socks inside out, fluffy side out when using powder\n9. If you have boots loosen the laces when you're driving or sitting\n10. Elevation of your feet will help blood from pumping so hard to the feet\n11. While you treat your feet, use socks when your shoes are off, if you have fungus you don't want you or your lady to get infected elsewhere... Don't sleep with socks on...\n12. Clean your floors and bathrooms regularly until the smell disappears\n13. Go see a doctor and give them, as they said, the full experience.\n\nAll of this can take upto a year. Clean your feet like you maintain your car, they may be your only means of transportation someday!\n\nGodspeed!",

Often months to fully kill the fungus on or in the skin and or nails. 2. You must get rid of or serious treat all your socks and shoes! No point in treating your foot and then sticking it back into an old sock and back into the same shoes. Foot Fungus needs warm, moist, dark environment to florish. Guess what that's your shoes and socks. Start treating your feet in the winter and when you start seeing results, get new cheap shoes. Then through spring and summer keep your feet dry and keep treating them. Use flip flops, saddles etc. If all goes well and you disinfect your other stuff really really well. You could be well on the way to less smelly feet. Not a doctor but studied feet and infections for esthetics.",

Lush makes one called T is for Toes I use when I wear closed-toe shoes w/o socks.  There are probably other similar options at the market, especially at a natural foods store.\n   * If rubbing the foot powder into your feet everyday feels like a chore, you can also sprinkle some into your socks before putting the socks on your feet.\n* When you get home, wash & dry your feet!\n* Set your shoes outside somewhere (patio or garage) to let them dry out before you put them back in a shoebox.\n   * Please use a shoebox to store your shoes, having a closed container will help keep your bedroom / closet / home from smelling like your stank ass shoes.  Feel free to slip crumpled newspaper in them to absorb extra moisture, or use a half dryer sheet to help them smell better.\n\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk.",

Regular laundry doesn't kill fungi, meaning your socks start smelling in no time when put them on.\n* Consider that when you find a cream that works for your feet, you might need to wear flip flops or other well ventilated feet wear in the house that you can easily clean/disinfect. Otherwise you'll keep reinfecting your feet just by walking around the house.\n* Try Terbafine Hydrochloride for athlete's foot. It's much more effective than alternative creams. Discipline is key here.\n* Dry your feet well after showering (I am sure you already do this). Always, without exception. With a different towel than you use for your body.",

(like for me, I had 2 on my back - the normal tinea corporis and also tinea versicolor! Which also means I have permanent discoloured patches on me) usually done in an hour.\n\n\nAlso **don't use steroidal cream** if itchy. It itches like a bitch but steroidal creams calms down the skin, which reduces itch but help the fungus grow. :(",

Guard rails are meant to stop people from falling and absolutely should have been able to support your weight leaning against it. I wouldn't be surprised if this triggered an inspection of all balcony railings at your apartment complex. I've seen countless apartments replace balconies and their railings over the years due to water damage, it's a fairly common occurrence.\n\nWhile I'm not advocating for you to sue your complex, you'd absolutely have a case for them to cover your medical costs and lost wages at a minimum. Up to you whether you'd want to, but I'd retain a lawyer and absolutely wouldn't sign anything brought to you by your apartment complex trying to absolve them of responsibility. Don't even talk to them or say anything more than \"I leaned up against the railing and it gave way\".\n\nThe real fuck up here is the lack of adequately safe railing on your balcony. This is a MAJOR issue, they and you are lucky you didn't die.\n\nI'm glad you're set to heal and hopefully get your feet taken care of.",

I'm sorry man, i've not once had foot odor become a common point of contention. If your feet have become a meme in your relationship, well just like stereotypes the baseline comes from a common truth. She likes you enough with it, but it IS an actual issue.\n\nSee a doctor about it. No joke. Without knowing anything about it, you likely have a toenail fungus. Regardless of that, if you ever want this girlfriend thing to go beyond that you have to change yourself and start becoming a socks guy. Buy/make a footwash station and wash them when you get home. It may seem excessive, but to make a comparative example if you were someone that excessively sweats a lot you wouldn't come home with a completely soaked shirt, and i meant 100% all over damp, and just change the shirt while basting in your residue. If those two fails or are too \"hard\" to start getting into the habit of then start keeping baking soda around the house and just douse your feet in them. Probably not the best for your skin but you gotta do something.",

I had this problem as a kid (fungus feet)  and the only thing that helped in the long run was to treat the feet as if I had a big open wound on the bottom. I had little cracked wounds, but bacteria weren\u2019t a problem so these wounds were not too bad. The fungus was a huge problem tho. \n\nHere\u2019s what I had to do \u2013 I was about 10 at the time:\n\n1.\tNo foot contact with anything but socks, clean bed linens, bottom of the shower stall/bathtub/ bath water, and anti fungal solution. \n2.\tBathroom foot hygiene: out of the shower, the only place I\u2019d put my feet down was a plastic tray of antifungal solution. I had a chair nearby, with a pair of socks ready, and a small towel. I\u2019d generally towel dry in the shower stall but not touch the feet much, then step into the solution, and *while keeping my feet in the tray* get my ass down on the chair. The I\u2019d dry my feet with a dedicated towel, put freshly cleaned socks on, and from that point onwards stand in my crocs, while putting pants on etc \u2013 no standing on the floor. \n3.\tNo contact between other clothes and bare feet: socks went on first, then pants, in that order. \n4.\tEvery time socks came off, they went to be washed, and they were kept in a separate basket from other dirty clothes. \n5.\tSocks after washing and ironing were kept in a plastic food box with one of those sealed airtight covers so that they\u2019d not be exposed to spores falling down on them from air (dust in the air has quite a lot of them). Kinda surgical instrument treatment lite: minimize exposure to fungus, so that feet won\u2019t get reinfected.\n6.\tWhen I began treatment, I had to get new shoes, new socks, new bed linens. Socks and linens were washed on sanitize cycle and then ran through an ironing machine (or ironed with a handheld iron). The small \u201cfoot towels\u201d were kept separately from other towels, in an airtight container of their own, washed with the socks and ironed as well. Towels were used once.\n7.\tThere was some antifungal powdery spray that my parents would squirt daily into my shoes, after loosening up the shoelaces so the tongue was sprayed too, and the shoelaces were sprayed from outside.\n\nYou could call it aseptic technique lite. It worked, and for me, sadly, nothing less was successful. It took about 4 years to figure out all the steps above \u2013 skipping some yielded partial improvement at best, but no eradication. My feet were in really bad shape from the fungus. Somehow the toenails didn\u2019t get infected, only the skin. \n\nOnce the fungus was eradicated, we progressively lessened the prophylaxis, and it didn\u2019t reappear. In the decades since, I didn\u2019t walk around with naked feet almost ever other than at the pool, around a lake/ beach or on sandy roads in the woods I\u2019m the summer, or in the bathroom at home.\n\nIn my case, the fungus could be easily prevented from recolonizing the feet, but once established it was brutal. The dermatologist who was taking care of me said that it was some strain that was really tough to get rid of, and thankfully rare. There were days I could not walk well since my skin was so cracked and it all just hurt. The doc was a godsend. Even in the first few months of establishing some of the routine my feet would not hurt anymore and it felt so much better, but still the fungus was there, just suppressed a bit.",

Even if you don't buy new footwear afterwards, which I'd do, but know other people can't afford, soak them. air dry them. use new, clean socks, footwear. This is needed for you.\n\nI've tried every cream or spray on the market, anti fungals, itch, ALL/everything to no avail. I feel for you. Please, take $3 and do as I suggest.

Like, people walking down the hall outside could smell it with the door closed horrible.\n\nTo his credit he did try a number of things, from spraying his boots and feet with anti-fungal, to putting his boots in a ziplock bag after he took them off to seal that secondary odor away. Showering as soon as he got back from class. Fabreeze spraying, getting a timed scent sprayer, baby powering his feet every morning and night.\n\nNothing helped. I told him to see a doctor and I ended up changing rooms due to normal dorm shuffling. I can only assume they had to chop his feet off.

I ask because I myself developed a really sour smell on my foot but never when Im in a different home, hotel or country as I travel for work sometimes.\n\nI realized it was my damn old carpet at home and office both that never got changed and the zero air circulation in my office also cause me and other co workers to smell extra...uhh musky.\n\nSince Im renting I cant do a full carpet changes for now but places were I lay a runner or a new decorative carpet, my feet wont smell. And someone suggested I soak my feet in alcohol  mixed in water for 2-3 mins before and after work to kill the bacteria.  Worked like a charm. \n\nDiet can play a HUGE role if you are the type that will emit off what they eat.   I have a co worker that smells constantly like onions until he didnt eat it as much. Took a while for his body to purge it out of his system",

Thats right sir, learned it in the army.  Your pee has ammonia or something in it that kills the fungus.  Let the water get hot, turn it off pee on your feet, resume shower.  Think im lying?  Try it.\n\n2.)  Foot powder and new socks.  Throw all your nasty socks away and get some freshies.  Use goldbond foot powder in your socks and be sure to shake them up.  Dont be afraid to use a bunch.  Do this everyday.\n\n3.) Put antifungal cream on your feet before you go to sleep.  Get every crevice.  Sleep barefoot.  Be sure to clip your toenails too.\n\n4.)  Carry extra socks with u and change your socks when your feet get sweaty or nasty.   New dry socks makes you feel like a new man everytime.  I always keep spair socks in my glovebox.\n\nThats all.",

I have learned that with so many types of fungus, there are even MORE treatments available for such. For example, the active ingredients in Selsun Blue vary from something like TGel, targeting different aspects of dandruff. This can be seen in women's yeast infection treatments as well. Could it be that maybe you have yet to find the correct product for your particular issue?\n\nI also found that using a pH balanced soap (usually labeled as a mild vaginal cleanser) on my effected fungal bits helps tremendously. It removes any \"build up\" without stripping the skin of it's natural and necessary oils. I imagine that using the wrong soap on your already infected feet could lead to further irritation, resulting in a constant cycle to correct the current (possible collection) of issues.\n\nLastly, I take a yeast control supplement from the brand AZO. It can be taken to help relieve the effects and minimize the growth of yeast overabundance, but it can also be taken daily to ensure those levels stay normal and healthy throughout the whole body. As I said before, I'm not sure what is causing your issue, but if it is associated with yeast and/or fungus, this may help!",

The fact that each foot can produce a cup of sweat in a day really opened my eyes. All that moisture in your shoes every day. It was a bacterial playground. I bought a shoe/boot dryer on Amazon for like $30 bucks years ago. Life changing.\n\nThis is what I did. Bought several pairs of shoes/boots so I never wore the same pair every day. I never wear the same pair of shoes 2 days in a row. When I come home every day I put the shoes I wore on the shoe dryer. The next day I wear a different pair. The following day I can wear the 1st pair again. At that point they have been on the dryer for a day so they are completely dry. I also wear socks once a day and then wash. Once I come home I take them off try to be barefoot as much as possible at home. You need to let your feet BREATHE. By doing these things I have no more stinky feet, no more stinky shoes.

(be careful not to break the skin, that shit hurts). It didn't exist when I did this but the sanitizer gel might be easier to use on your feet as it sticks. \n   \nI repeated this treatment about 6 times over 2 months, and ended up buying some new gym shoes because they seemed to be a source of re-infection no matter how much alcohol I used.  I haven't had a case of serious stinkfoot since and when they start to get even a bit funky, I spray my shoes and give myself a nice pedicure and it's gone.  \n\nI hope that helps you and anyone else with the dreaded stinkfoot.",

      "text": "I love doing this, it's like my second favorite thing to tell people about that will absolutely change your life. Ready?\n\nWOOL SOCKS, specifically Marino wool. They are soft, absorbent and comfortable. Most of all they don't stink after a 18houe day, in fact they almost always smell like their fresh out of the washer. Don't fuck around either, get 5 pairs. I live by Darn Tough Socks. Their expensive sure, but I work 16-18:hour days on the regular in boots no less and my feet? Their happy and comfortable rain snow or shine. They don't get hot in the summer in wool socks, they don't get cold in the winter in wool socks, they don't stink ever after years of issues with cotton. Don't delay order a pair now and prove me wrong. My feet sweat a lot, they don't stink after long days of work and don't hurt ever after finding Darn Tough about five years ago. I own 2 winter pairs that are extra thick for when it's super cold and 6 pairs of medium thickness for year round. If you wear out a pair you send them back and get credited for a new pair, no questions asked. I've saved hundreds of dollars over the years by not having to replace shit socks constantly and my boots and feet thank me for it. Hit up a doc and make sure you don't have a fungal infection, over the counter stuff has it's limitations. Try to soak your feet in Epsom salt too. Man, women, whatever else people go by nowadays, it doesn't matter DARN TOUGH MARINO WOOL SOCKS for everyone, you won't regret it.\n\nAs for my first favorite thing, sadly this is a men's only thing... Saxx underwear, my god there's nothing better than having a pocket for your junk. Bigger guy? Hung like a mule? Constantly sit on your nuts? How about all day comfort that keeps your junk in a Fronk. A soft pocket that keeps your boys isolated and stowed for safe travelsm. Getting a vesectomy sometime soon? Not until after you get yourself a few pairs of saxx. Their stretchy and soft and support you junk. It's like having your balls craddeled by clouds. No man knows comfort without saxx and Darn Tough Socks. Spoil yourself and your partner this holiday season, spoil your son's and daughters parents and siblings. \n\nMy third favorite thing to tell people about is Luvsac, thanks for asking! A modular couch with a lifetime guarantee? Hell yeah. Wanna know how I got sold? I watched a 400 pound dude using the bases as a trampoline on the sales floor. He pulled everything apart and swapped the layout in minutes and it was comfortable as hell in store. Couches tend to get gross and need special cleaning, run a vaccine across it to get the popcorn and candy bits and throw the cover in the laundry. What about painting the room a new color? Green was in a few years ago but gray seems more your style for that minimalist look, all you do is change the covers and pow, new couch. Having guests over and need extra seating? Lay out your couch in whatever way optimized the ass to cushion ratio. Spilled food or drink on the sofa that would normally leave a stain? Throw that bitch it the washing machine and poof problem gone! Need more seating? Order some more parts and slap it together in whatever way you need to. How about storage? They got that as well, storage bottoms are an extra 50 bucks and can hold blankets, presents you dont want the kids to find or even act as a hiding place for the little kids during hide and seek. Don't need a couch yet but want something comfortable, get a love sac. It's a GIANT fuggin cloud you can jump on as an adult that seconds as a bed. Get a cover to match your couch or room and enjoy! The Big One fits my wife and children and I plus a dog comfortabley. Don't keep wasting money on shit furniture you'll only enjoy for the first year or two. Parts of my couch are 7 years old, other 2 years old. You can't tell the difference in comfort or quality.",

If I towel dried myself, dressed (and I use that term pretty loosely) & popped the slippers on, by the afternoon, things were getting whiffy.  \nIf I dried, dressed & then went barefoot for a while, 15mins to 1/2 an hour,  before putting the slippers on there was minimal to no detectable odour.  \n\n\nI was always curious how someone who couldn't use her feet was such a fountain of knowledge on preventing smelly feet.  \nHi Five Vanessa, where ever you are!",

My son recently had a smelly foot issue because he wore the same shoes daily. It's from the sweat not being able to dry out between being worn. Easy fix that can be resolved in a week or less. Alternate shoes every other day and always wear clean socks. Bamboo charcoal packs work great too. Try it out. Also, your GF sounds like a keeper. Good luck bud!",

Like you, nothing really worked, or it work for a short period of time then be ineffective.\n\nHere's what ya gotta do: First off, keep Lysol spray where you keep your shoes. Give them a healthy spray after you take them off, and a little spurt before putting them on. This part is essential. Because no matter what creams, sprays, or scrubbing you do, you're reinfecting your feet every time you put your shoes on.\n\n Get yourself a Tupperware bin that's big enough to hold your feet, and deep just past your ankles. \n\nGet water as hot as you can handle, mix in Epsom Salts (about 1 cup) until there are few or no salt crystals left. About 10 drops or 2 heavy dashes of lavender essential oil, same amount of Rosemary Essential oil, and 1 dash or 5 drops of tea tree essential oil. Which all have antifungal and skin healing properties. You'll need to do this daily, for 15-30 minutes. On top of this you have to keep all your toe nails cut short, regularly. \n\nThese practices will kill any and all fungus, athlete's foot, ringworm, etc. \n\nI know it's not the funnest thing to add to your routine, but your feet with not only be odor free, they won't have any itching, burning, sweatiness, or inflammation.\n\nI hope this helps homie, I promise it's at least worth giving a try!",

(I want to clarify that none of these are based on any studies or are factual, just things that might be worth considering.)\n\n\\-keep/clean your floors/carpet. Your feet may likely pick up the smell from them collecting dirt and odour over the years. The same way when you wear a pre-worn t-shirt, you start to sweat and pick up the smell of the t-shirt, your feet might be doing the same thing.\n\n\\-Check whether the type of materials your shoes affects the smell. More breathable shoes may keep your feet cool but you would want a pair that is balanced so as not to be too breathable.\n\n\\-Your shoes may be a bit too tight, so it might be worth going up by half a size and looking for a slightly wider pair. (Or start wearing sandals more often without any socks)\n\n\\-You might consider purchasing better, more breathable socks. Bamboo socks are great for odour. You may also be wearing them too tight. By this, I mean leave a little loose at the tip of your toes when wearing just socks or with shoes.\n\n\\-Your diet may also be factor. It may be a by-product.\n\n\\-The temperature of your body or your room might affect your problem as well. Depending on your body, too much or too few layers may lead to this problem.\n\n\\-Aggressive rubbing and over washing leads to the same problem. You need to clean your feet gently and quickly. If your going to moisturise it after with a cream or oil, you may have to look for a specific one that works for you. Just remember, it's better to use a little than a lot; just enough to get a small across your whole foot. Too much might lead to your feet sweating again. Make sure your feet are dry before you apply it and get it in between your toes and massage it in. (For moisturiser/oil, consider looking for one that absorbs well but doesn't leave your feet feeling overly lubricated/oily)\n\n\\-You mentioned that you're a burly guy. This may also be a contributing factor. The burden of carrying extra muscle may be taxing on your feet.\n\n\\-Your daily routine is also worth considering. How often are you on your feet, what are you doing and for how long?\n\n\\-Doctors are not necessarily the best people to talk to about specific ailments. It would be better to speak to a feet specialist (Podiatrist? or maybe to spa staff? (might not cost a thing if you just go in and speak to them)).\r  \n\n\nI hope your injuries heal quickly and wish you the best of luck!",

Alas, a plan was formed. \n\nSpoiler alert: >!He made his feet into a smell-bomb by not taking his shoes off for a week  and neutralized the kids.!< Most epic conclusion of story telling history.  \n\n\nOne of my favorite stories, ngl.

Mix in a cup of salt and a good amount of toilet cleaner or Drano....this is usually some sort of chlorine containing compound or a weak solution of hydrochloric acid which is relatively non toxic. Now place your feet in there, wash for a few minutes maybe 10 to 20. Take your feet out and then rinse for a good 15 minutes in a Normal shower. This will definitely kill anything you had on them causing your smell. Now wash your shoes and your socks. Repeat  every day until it's gone. Definitely a huge difference after the first time. This works. There's no funny foot dissolving business, it's just off the shelve chemicals that are totally safe to use if you dilute them. Do not do this with straight up Drano or you will be feeling tingly food dissolving action for a few minutes until you can't feel tingling.",

Mositure is the enemy, and the infection survived on dead skin on the thick soles of my feat - primarily on the heel & ball of foot. I finally discovered and used a pumice stone to remove the dead skin. Went heavy on the spray powder, simultaneously washed all my socks separately from any other other laundry on the hottest water setting. Threw away every pair of old, smelly shoes. It's a constant, daily battle. \n\nNow decades later, I still wash my socks separately in hot water. It's so hard to cure this, and such an intrusion. Good luck",

She takes something called glycopyrrolate (it\u2019s a prescription) and it has helped immensely. My brother started taking it too after he saw how well it worked for her. Anyway if it\u2019s sweating that\u2019s the problem and you\u2019re willing to take a medication, see a dermatologist. Good luck!",

I have a cure! \nTo be honest I only use this to avoid athlete's foot from gym showers, hotel carpets etc, but despite 12h shifts in steel toed boots I have almost no foot odor since I started doing this so it has really good odds plus it is cheap AF.   \nGet some borax from the laundry aisle. Use a wee bit, a teaspoon to a tablespooon (5-20g if you're modern) to massage your feet once they are soft from a shower. Rinse and dry well. And that's it! That shit kills microbes amazingly well!     \nA bit of a boost may be gained by massaging in a peasized bit of coconut oil (an alleged antimicrobial) afterwards, or a coconut oil with light baking soda in it- upsetting the pH screws with microbes (Primal Pit Paste is a natural deodorant with coconut oil and baking soda the main ingredients, and they sell tiny containers for sample or travel, for like $2 or something which is nice if you wanna just experiment before committing too much money).    \nI used the borax every day or two when fighting the initial athlete's foot infection that led me to discover this home remedy, or if foot odor flares up like from buying secondhand shoes or skipping showers too often or whatnot. Only every couple weeks once things are under control.      \nSince I learned about borax I have not had a recurrence of athlete's foot and any stink is quashed within days. Legit miracle cure!   \nAnd so cheap and low risk!  \nIf you don't like it, you can use the borax up as a laundry detergent booster, great for washing out \"new clothes stink\" or mildew, fragrance, smoke etc.  \nGood luck!",

She had these Ugg boots that she wore a lot. She threw them in the back of my hatchback and after about 8 hours in the sun the car smelled like I\u2019d run over some very ripe roadkill and it was being cooked in the engine. When we tracked the smell to her shoes, they were thrown into the bush.",
