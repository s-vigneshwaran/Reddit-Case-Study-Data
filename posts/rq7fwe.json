They would often get lists from the clubs and bar owners of who they had licenses with and they had to stick with it.   That's where I learned about that world of licenses.  Even the songs on the jukeboxes had to be licensed, and the owners have had agents come in and inspect them.\n\nThat took me down the deep rabbit hole of how there are roaming agents going to chain stores and shopping centers and resturants noting the ones who are playing music.   Something you wouldn't really think about, but it's there.  Rights owners hold on tight and fight tooth and nail.\n\nThat's why later on it kinda blew me away when I learned twitch & youtube gaming could really be shutdown overnight, gaming is the exact same way.  In fact I discovered game publishers used to actively take down game videos on youtube in the early days, until they discovered the free advertising was worth it.   But even today the rights still aren't there and the law hasn't changed, twitch could be stricken offline on a whim which is why they are pretty quick to act on any takedown notices they do get - nintendo for example was been known to actively hunt for emulator players in the past and if it was obvious they would get shut down.\n\n\nSomething like a movie to a room full(ish) of paying customers? hah, good fucking luck cinema-plex place.

As soon as the elevator door opened he screamed at me not to enter. Dude has run the film from one projector, off the platter and up onto a suspension pulley system to another projector. He did this for all of them projectors. So each film was threading through 4 projectors. But not all the projectors were next to each other, so he had to run one film across the area over the lobby and back to get 4 machines together. \n\nI just got back on the elevator and went downstairs. I didn't want to be there if literally anything snagged and brought down 4 theaters of Harry Potter and deal with the absolute shitstorm that would follow.\n\nUnrelated un fact: If you fast forward a 35mm projector too fast the film will catch fire.",

Both for the same reasons oddly, middle aged women can be so savage.\n\nThe most infuriating was probably a single dude rolling in at 1030 to watch the Incredile Hulk on Xmas eve. And leaving 30 minutes into the movie. We hadn't seen a single person since 530 so we figured once it was 1045 we could just turn everything off and go home.\n\nAgain, it was 35mm so it's not like we could just turn the movie off.

Anything remotely modern in a theater is polyester-based (aka safety stock), which really doesn't do anything but melt in high heat, so it's not really dangerous.\n\nWhen they're shooting film, the cameras use an acetate base stock instead of polyester, because polyester is so strong that instead of breaking or snapping if there's a high tension event or a jam in the camera, it'll hold and the camera mechanisms themselves will break (which is way more expensive, obviously).  Acetate will bubble and melt.\n\nYou're thinking of the really old-school nitrate base film, which was *incredibly* flammable, so much so that older film would combust at temperatures as long as 120dg F - it would even autocombust from the decomposing film releasing incredibly flammable gasses.  Nitrate is also known as guncotton, and can be used as a replacement for gunpowder in firearms.  That's what you saw in Inglorious Basterds.",

A non-trained person will have a hard time figuring it out without screwing shit up.  (This of course all depends on the model of your projectors and sound processors).\n\nEx: For our projectors since they are older (> 10 years old), there is no HDMI input directly to the projector.  For us to hook up a Laptop or Console (we did rentals during the pandemic and had people bring their Xbox, Playstation and Switchs in), we actually have to run the HDMI through a blu-ray player installed in the sound tower.  That then connects to the projectors via DVI.  So, you have to know how to operate the blu-ray player to get that on screen properly, which lens setting to select to actually get the image on screen and which output to select on the sound processor to get sound.",

That's a piece of code that other programs can use to do a specific task. In this case, logging. Lots of open source libraries exist. Sometimes, they're maintained by big corporations and get frequent updates. Sometimes they're a tiny project developed by 1 guy who was bored one day and pushes an update every couple of months when he feels like working on it.\n\nThe problem arises when one of those latter projects gets widely adopted, but nobody contributes properly to the project they're using. You can't expect a single person or a tiny team to find every single problem in their code. So sometimes, the library they wrote contains a serious bug which basically makes every piece of software that incorporates that library vulnerable to attack.\n\nThis is basically what happened with log4j2. A tiny team made this library which ended up being used by everyone and their dog and suddenly half the internet turned out to be easily hack-able. From VMWare VCenter control centers all the way down to frigging Minecraft Servers.\n\nI've spent quite a few hours tracking down, patching and mitigating software that contains that bug at work the last few weeks.",

They also have an agreement in place for use of the personal app as well iirc to cover esoteric incidents. To be honest, I have seen one bar shut down for not carrying the proper licensing. Most of the time, unless it is explicitly reported, or caught during some sort of random stop by, nothing will happen. Licensing is the key for all of this. Public radio (which you hear in a lot of places), is licensed per the intended audience of the device. Eg personal radio, 1 listener. So if you have an average of 300 people visit your store a day for a year, you could be hit with a shit ton of fines \u2026 theoretically. Tbh, unless you live in a larger city or draw enough attention, you\u2019ll fly under their radar. They have bigger fish to fry atm.",

Any establishment with less than 2,000 gross square feet, and any food service or drinking establishment with less than 3,750 square feet.\n>\n> 2. Any business establishment with greater than 2,000 square feet, and any food service or drinking establishment with greater than 3,750 square feet provided that they use fewer than 6 speakers or TVs, no more of 4 of which are any one room, and with a screen size of less than 55 inches.\n>\n> To qualify for these exceptions, the business owner must not charge an admission fee nor play any other music other than terrestrial radio and TV.\n\nLong story short, there _are_ licensing requirements, but if you're on Reddit, you probably aren't a business large enough to need a license.",

Back in highschool/early college, I worked for my dad's company, which supplied these jukeboxes to bars and restaurants. At the time, there were really only two or three big competitors in this scene, primarily NSM and Touchtunes. These days it's pretty much all Touchtunes, but the business model has more-or-less stayed the same. \n\nEvery time you've seen one of those Touchtunes jukeboxes, that thing is likely not owned by the establishment it's in. Instead, the business leases the hardware and either pays a flat monthly fee or splits the revenue from the jukebox with the company that leases it to them. Those companies are called \"operators\". So, the operator pays all the licensing fees to ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC, and then provides the hardware to the bar/restaurant/whatever. The interesting part is that the bar/restaurant/whatever can curate exactly which artists, genres, songs, etc they want their patrons to be able to play. So if you've seen some songs available and not others, it means that the owner/management has decided that those are the songs that they want to be played in their establishment. They typically do this to maintain a certain atmosphere or vibe which suits the theme/regular clientele of the business. So if you walk into a bar and most of the people there are middle aged, white, blue collar workers, don't expect to find Katy Perry or Kanye West on the jukebox.",

The radio station is the one supplying, they are the one in control of producing a copy of something and liable for licensing the radio spectrum and the content they broadcast on it. Trying to fine the end user viewing that spectrum is just an attempt to double dip. \n\nTo put it another way, if I\u2019m listening to the radio and a station starts illegally playing music they don\u2019t have the rights for, did I commit a crime? No, of course not because I\u2019m not the one in control of the delivery mechanism. I didn\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d anything to be put in that situation. The same goes for other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and use cases. If you violate copyright and print an image illegally on a billboard, passerby\u2019s are not legally liable for anything by viewing that chunk of the spectrum either. If you\u2019re a busker on the street and play copyrighted content, nearby pedestrians are not liable.\n\nLikewise, what\u2019s the difference between 50 people hearing a song on their car radio and 50 people hearing a song in a deli that\u2019s playing the radio? In neither situation did any of those people create a copy of the content. If the deli radio was tuned to static on an unused frequency they would be committing no crime at that point, but suddenly if a station starts broadcasting on that frequency they would be? Why? What action did they take that should make them liable? They didn\u2019t create a copy of that music they merely provided an spectrum interpreter device, something anyone can freely do with simple technology at home. \n\nIf a creator demands to be paid for every set of eyes and ears that receive their art then they shouldn\u2019t sign away their rights permitting the exact opposite. Blaming the people for nonconsensual receipt is bullshit.",

If you don't get pay, but still watch TV (so you're watching it illegally), you can just tell them when they send you a letter about it, saying that you don't use the TV to watch actual broadcast TV (you don't need a licence to use a TV for video games or streaming apps). Then that's it, they never come round again to bother you after that. They just believe you. It's not a police matter, the TV license people who come around to ask you can't enter your home to check the TV unless you let them in. \n  \nThey can't do anything about it. They aren't police officers, they can't enter your home against your will. You don't have to let them in. And they don't use magical TV detector things in their vans to see if you're telling the truth or not from the street outside your house, that's just a myth that people believe. It was a PR stunt by the TV licensing people to try and scare people into paying for the TV license, and it worked at doing that, scaring people, because they thought they could end up paying a huge fine or even go to prison or something. People who used to work for the TV licence people driving around the vans, say that it was all a myth and those detectors don't really exist. I don't think very many people have ever gone to prison for not having a TV licence either, that seems to be another PR stunt to scare people. It seems to be a thing that only happens if someone hasn't paid the fine in full and is trying to hide out somehwre where they can't be found, and so they go to prison for not paying the fine, rather than being sent to prison specifically because they haven't paid for the TV licence. They're two different things. \n   \nBut yeah the TV licence people just leave you alone once you've told them you don't use the TV for broadcast TV. Or maybe they'll send another year 5 years later, so you just do it again, send the letter back saying that you don't use the TV for broadcast TV, you just use it for streaming apps or games, or input that option on the TV license website, and they won't come back to ask you anymore after that. \n  \nIt's been a fair few years since I watched normal broadcast TV. I just use streaming apps these days. I \"cut the cord\" long ago. You don't need one for Netflix or amazon or Disney+ or anything like that so it's fine. I can even watch BBC shows without needing a license, all the ones that are on Netflix. So like a few years ago I sat down and watched all of the reboot series of Doctor who, without a TV licence, and it was all legal.\n  \nI think it's another myth mainly, another PR stunt, the idea that everyone will be constantly hassled if they don't get a TV licence. There's just nothing they can really do about it. It's a really really low priority thing. The police don't give a shit about it, they've got actual crimes to investigate. They don't go round to houses asking people if they've got a TV licence lol",

As part of that they need to declare how many people attend the events they play at and the fee will vary according to size.

Any music you buy and play at a social situation like a party at your house is fine, but the instant people are paying to attend you need a licence for the music. I actually have no problem with the DJ thing as without the music the event wouldn\u2019t happen, but charging for people to listen to the radio on a bus is stupid.",

I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t have a license and only one event did we charge admission - it was a dog show for mutts - the music was background noise, but still.

Usually these places were showing fights that weren\u2019t purchased to be seen in a large venue or people using their personal Direct TV or Dish for their restaurants. He would roll up and get an appetizer or a drink (which would be paid back at a lesser rate, I think 80%) and then he would take pictures of what was playing and whatever box they might have up. He would then submit them and the businesses would get fined for it, basically for not having a business account. At one point I think he was even doing some stuff for Netflix making sure places weren\u2019t using that but I can\u2019t remember if that was true or not.

You're not even allowed to select individual songs to play, like you can with Spotify. You can pick playlists or genres. But picking individual songs would require a jukebox license from the PROs, which is expensive as hell.\n\nThere are multiple licenses from ASCAP/BMI/SESAC/GMR. Many bars/restaurants/stores have the standard license they get from a background music provider, but if they have a DJ or live music, they need that to be licensed as well. \n\nIt's also way more expensive that you're suggesting. ASCAP is $390 for a year, and if you add in the other three PRO services, we're talking well over $1000 per year. Paying for Soundtrack Your Brand (or any other background music service) is going to be significantly cheaper (some are as cheap as $10/month).",

Then you have to meet the definition of a broadcast. \n\nGenerally speaking record companies have real things to worry about rather than people playing their music for other people.\n\nPedantic assholes are going to crawl up my ass. Just remember this: there is what is legal, and what is likely. You\u2019re intensely unlikely to be fined for playing any type of music anywhere. \n\nMost of these stories are 100% certified organic horseshit.",

The pub did not, and were just playing it off a DVD.\nSo the guy shut the screening down. \n\nOn the opposite side of the spectrum, the company I work with once hired out a screening room for a Christmas party. Our boss played a movie off a Blu-ray, but I remember overhearing him talk about how he had specifically obtained permission.

Because that's what's happening here. Food needs to be produced. An MP3 is an \"infinite\" resource for which is done only once and for which we are still charged for, even so in indirect ways on platforms that seemingly provide it for free, and rightfully so.\n\nThen, why go out of their way to screw people then if we are paying for it one way or the other? Because labels have enough money to accommodate the law so that they are allowed to do that and more, until they realized that the internet got too big for their pants, that is.\n\nWhy do you think most artists nowadays create their own labels or opt to crowd-funding? Because that's the only way (especially for smaller artists) to be able to actually make a living of creating art without going through the risk of bankruptcy if they don't make it even when signed with a label.\n\nAsk Gabe Newell, the man that helped develop one of the most iconic games in history and CEO of the most successful game distribution site, what does he thinks about people who piracy.\n\n\"If a pirate offers a product anywhere in the world, 24 x 7, purchasable from the convenience of your personal computer, and the legal provider says the product is region-locked, will come to your country 3 months after the US release, and can only be purchased at a brick and mortar store, then the pirate\u2019s service is more valuable\"\n\nWhen the music I like is region blocked, I can't pay for it since it's not sold/streamed to my country and my only option is buy an overpriced used import, or simply, I don't have your luck and I'm not wealthy enough to buy non-essencial stuff, am I \"stealing\" it if I download it from SoulSeek?\n\nAnd even more so, because this is entirely the decision of the label (since it's them who actually own the music), rather than the artist themselves?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I do download it from soulseek, do you think the artist would be:\n\na) Mad because I got really inspired and happy with their music that I can't pay for, so I wouldn't have even listened to it or bought if piracy didn't exist and that if I did buy it they would have made $0.007 USD (avg. amount of money paid to per song, then divide that with the musicians, lyricists, producers, etc.) from it.\n\nb) Happy because they like when people appreciate and share the art they made.\n\nI can't speak for most people, but I have my bets on one answer.\n\nDo you genuinely believe they will gain more from 10 people buying their songs and no one pirating it, than 3 people buying it and 100 pirating it? Do you actually value the pennies of song sales higher than the exposure they get, which can later earn them a livable wage out of making art?\n\nThe people that keep defending big corporations who milk society can keep doing so, I personally try to help (or at least, encourage) a change to a world where artists and content creators don't have to be beggars. Patreon is one way, but there are many.",

              "text": "Digital cinema projectors do NOT have a monitor attached to view content.   At my theater, if I'm playing a regular Hollywood current release, there is no way to view the content except on the big screen.   It's part of the \"movie piracy\" security features.  The movie files on the server are encrypted.  The path from the server to the projector is encrypted.   The actual decryption of the movie takes place \"on-the-fly\" while its playing.  \n\n\nThere are no connections for a booth monitor on the projector anywhere.  The reasoning is if you can output the content to a booth monitor, you can also output it to a recording device.\"Alternative content\" like Netflix, Hulu, DVD or Bluray uses an HDMI port on the side of the projector to feed that content to the projector.   In both of my projection booths, we have a rack mounted scaler / switcher that is hooked up to the projector that can feed the projector Bluray, Direct TV, and another HDMI source.  The scaler/switcher has dual mirrored outputs so one feeds the projector, and the other feeds a wall mounted video monitor.  \n\n\nThe theater shown in this thread either doesn't have a booth monitor for their smart Bluray player or laptop, or they were just too lazy to hit the \"dowser\" button on the side of the projector.  Either way, streaming content from Amazon Prime for public viewing is a major violation of copyright infringement.",

It depends if it's 2k or 4k, 2d or 3d, high frame rate. I've seen some come in as low as 25 gigabytes for old and shorter 30s films, and the worst I remember seeing was HFR Hobbit about 10 years back, coming in near 1 terabyte for the full everything included package. It's been years since I did cinema but I doubt they've changed too much since then. Average cinema server is older, custom firmware, mostly Linux based (with only 2 vendors I know of using non Linux), custom hardware, fully encrypted, usually 500GB-1TB drives, some people upgrading to 2-8 depending on their use case. Newer designs are all in the projector using laptop drives or SSDs, or with a NAS right below to store the data. Most multiplexes will use a dedicated system to manage all screens.",

The max spec is 250Mbit/s if I remember correctly, and most films will use 100-150 or so. It's purely down to the film studios choice and usually depends on the type of film. Action films will almost always go to the higher end of the spec compared to a drama. Avengers for example might be around 250GB for the 2k and 4k versions, both set to the same bit rate, but toy story 4 was 185GB for a film of almost half the length, purely because Disney said so.

The media blocks were custom pci (and I think pcie later) boards that were specifically to decrypt the media during playback, and they were time stamped keys. It was then re encrypted to transmit to the projector. The media blocks were setup to only allow one change per year and only by 10 minutes. Anything beyond that required you have the server/media block vendor change it remotely, or in some cases you had to send it in.  \n     \nTo the saavy, old old media blocks (which can't be used any longer, or newer ones if you happened to be doing some keylogging and version control on your system so deleted files could be brought back) could have their media block times changed to bypass the timestamp without any real issue, but really, 99.9% weren't going to do that and it was entirely a breach of contract to do so. Newer ones use a vendor side encryption on the packages sent over, tied to the media block like a film key, so they're much harder to pull off.     \n     \nNormally you'll get your film on the hdd from deluxe or technicolor (though I think technicolor bought deluxe a few years back so it may be one or there may be new ones) and then separately you'd get keys. Some places got them by usb and still do (and have boxes of 1GB-32GB usb 2.0 sticks) , but most get them via email now. If your a single screen or one without a central management setup (LMS is the common term but there's a few names for it), you'd go plug in the drive to the carrier (CRU makes them) and ingest the film package there, be it scope or flat or whatever format they're in. After that you'd ingest the keys in the same method via USB. Once the keys allowed times come around, you can play back the film. Most studios used to give you a midnight key unlock so you could \"verify\" (read: watch early with cinema staff since that's what happened) the content, some (Disney) hate to do that. Sometimes you can get a screening key sent for a single use time box, but that depends on the studio and specifically who at the studio is in charge.      \n     \nAfter the key expires, the content remains but you can't play it. You can delete it yourself for space or you can hold it for whatever reason and request new keys later (read: pay them the $). Newer or multiplex theaters will use a central media server and you'd centrally ingest and schedule all of your screens, next to no interaction with them beyond macro setup and sending the Playlist off. Keys and content both go over the network, Playlist is read, schedule is set up, and viola, at the scheduled time the projector turns on and everything happens.",

We have a GDC Enterprise Storage Plus drive array that has a built in CRU slot at each projector.  No cables or stuff, just slide the drive in the slot and pull up the contents via the monitor on the server.  \n\n\nThe majority (99%) of our content comes in via satellite.   We use a service called DCDC (Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition).  The folks at DCDC came in and installed a 6 foot satellite dish and a Kencast receiver and its associated networked attached storage array.   The Kencast server sits in a rack in our secondary booth and is attached via Cat6 cable to our content media network.   Bigger theaters will have a TMS (Theatre Management System) that will move files off of the Kencast server to the individual projection servers automatically, but my theater (drive-in) only has two screens, so the expense of a full blown TMS isn't practical.    The way my theater is set up I have the Kencast server set up as an \"ingest source\" on each of my projection servers.  When I go to build playlists, I log into my projection servers and tell it \"go look on the Kencast server and copy \"whatever movie file name\" to the projection server.      \n\n\nMovie files or \"feature files\" range from 80gb to 130gb depending on the length of the film.  Each of my projection servers have 4TB of storage in their array.  I currently have 16 full length movies on one of my servers, plus about 80-90 misc. trailers and stuff and still have about 400gb of storage left.   Since we are a seasonal drive-in, I need to go in and delete all of those files to make room for the movies coming in 2022, just housekeeping stuff.    All of the KDM's for those files have expired except for Ghostbusters Afterlife, and it expires in 2 weeks.",

It's literally part of the TOS, stated in black and white, same as it was on Blu-rays, DVDs, and VHS tapes before streaming was the norm. \n\nWhen you rent, subscribe to a streaming service, and even if you \"buy\" a movie/TV show, you're only getting the rights for private viewing, you don't own a piece of the copyright, you're simply paying for a limited viewing permission, whether temporary or for longer as with physical media. Playing films/shows for public viewing is typically not allowed unless expressly permitted by the copyright holder, and especially not for a business profiting from showing the video. Special licensing agreements are required for businesses like theaters, and in addition to a significantly higher licensing fee, often comes with other requirements or restrictions, especially big budget new releases (e.g. number of screens/shows per day, profit sharing, etc). \n\nThis isn't complicated or nuanced law interpretation here, it's black and white copyright infringement. Getting caught doing something like this will result in all sorts of fines, blacklisting, or even possible criminal action for continued non-compliance. This isn't as bad as straight up pirating, but it's pretty significant and you can bet there are copyright lawyers looking into this the moment it gets their attention.\n\nhttps://info.legalzoom.com/article/copyright-laws-related-to-using-movies-for-group-showing",

You normally have the option to rent a copy of the film on a hard drive in DCP format, or get it on DVD or Blu Ray. However as the last decade has gone on it has become increasingly difficult to get DVD and Blu Ray for smaller productions because if they never made a DVD/BR for home release, they don't have them available to rent either.\n\nI work at a museum and we occasionally screen films. We were once asked by a director to just use a streaming service because we are not set up to deal with DCPs (digital cinema packages are weird and the needed equipment is cost prohibitive).\n\nThis was an extremely low budget documentary, and they signed a deal with a streaming service so there were no Blu Ray copies at all.I ended up DLing it off prime and playing it in playback pro because I don't trust streaming like that in front of an audience.",

This practice has been limited since the pandemic of course. \n\nAll in all, it's a pretty awesome thing that some theaters will do. It's a shame to know it's not practiced everywhere though.",

Then go through the menus, get the movie queued up and pause at the start.  Then when it's time, hit play so the menus go away, drop the house lights, open the dowser so the light hits the screen.

          "text": "Two methods are the most common.\n\n1. They use Internet connection or dedicated private WAN connection and download it from the Studios authorized distribution servers.\n\n2. The theater along with the purchasing rights to broadcast the film, sends a hard drive to the theater.\n\nIn both cases the movie is in a format called DCP(Digital Cinema Package), if you read about this it sounds complex, but it really simplifies the work that the projection system needs to display the film.\n\nUsually this DCP format is encrypted with a key, usually just a 128 bit AES key which is a symmetric key.\n\nBut there's usually a meta system for managing and encrypting/decrypting the AES key that can decrypt the DCP. So basically encryption on the key itself. The AES key is usually encrypted with an asymmetric key like RSA 2048.\n\nThe reason they do this is because AES key is pretty efficient/consistent with the speed it can decrypt the file so it's reliable that it will be decrypted by the time it gets to the frame it needs.\n\nWhere as with RSA 2048 it's a bit more expensive to run computationally and therefore more expensive to bruteforce. So it's better to encapsulate the AES key inside of it.\n\nUsually this meta key system has a management service associated with it called a KDM(Key Delivery Message) system. Based on the policies of the theaters and studios the RSA 2048(or whatever that specific studio is using) decryption key is either sent automatically to the projection system after a certain deadline or the studio employee themselves request for the key. Depends on the level of automation.\n\nNow with that RSA 2048 decryption key, it decrypts it and you get the 128 bit AES key which the projection system will store temporarily while the theater plays the film.\n\nThe DCP format/package is usually 'ingested' into the projection system so that it is readily accessible, so the DCP package along with the decryption key, the film can finally be played on the big screen.",

Most of our theatres are <500 seats, many are multipurpose buildings (i.e. a town hall, arts center or stage theatre) and not all have the projection tech to pull off the internet connection or the encrypted drives.\n\nIn these cases we get the licence for the film from the distributor and they send us a physical copy. However, as they are actually licencing the film we aren't tied to their copy. So if the physical copy breaks, gets lost etc. we can just go out and buy another copy to show (or use one of our own discs)\n\nThis is different if it's a brand new, not-on-release movie - in this case they send us a set number of digitally-watermarked discs (say, 10 BluRays) and we have to return all of these at the end or face consequences (sort of like being a BAFTA judge)\n\nAs long as the distributor has given us a licence to show Movie X at venue Y on date Z, we can use whatever source media we like (within obvious reason)\n\nWere we an actual cinema then it'd be encrypted drives all the way - but then we'd have a projection booth with fixed equipment like the 35mm days :)",

These aren't usually permanent, they flash up every 15mins or so.\n\nCopying is much harder because of the digital protection.\n\nBack in the day the copy protection would be something like Analogue Protefction System which actually messed with the AGC circuit of your VHS player and garbled the copy. \n\nThere is less of a focus these days on preventing you and more on 'finding you and fining you'. It's really easy to break DVD copy protection (DVD Shrink or DVD Decrypt were probably the best programs for this and could strip anything) so it's also more effective to focus away from the tech side.\n\nSo it's mostly things like digital watermarks.

If you have a public private key pair then I can encrypt it with your public key, and no one else can decrypt it, not even me (though obviously I still would have the original key) because only the private key can decrypt it.",

Studio creates movie, in order to distribute movie they encode it in a format called DCP. Studio sends movie to theater via internet or physical hard drive via courier. Theater receives file, ingests it into theater's projector system. However movie is encrypted. Theater requests decryption key. Movie can now be played.",

The symmetric AES keys used to encrypt the content essence must be carefully protected, so they are never distributed directly. Instead the AES keys are themselves encrypted using asymmetric 2048 bit RSA. Each playback system has its own unique public/private key pair. The private key is never shared and is buried in the playback systems within secure hardware meeting FIPS-140 security standards. The matching public key is shared with the distributor, who can then create Key Delivery Messages (KDMs) which control access to the encrypted content for each playback system. KDMs are XML files containing the RSA encrypted AES keys that can be decrypted only by the private key within the destination device. A KDM is associated to the particular compositions (CPLs) which may include multiple encrypted picture, sound and subtitle assets, and each playback system requires a uniquely generated KDM. KDMs also provide the ability to define date/time windows within which the KDM is valid. Playback systems will not allow playback outside of this validity window, allowing distributors to ensure that content cannot be unlocked prior to release date and to enforce the rental agreement period agreed with the exhibitor.",

The film came on 20 minute reels, so there was a reel for every 20 minutes of the movie.\n\nThe platter systems came out in the 1970s as a way to automate the process since before them they used \"changeover\" systems where there would be two projectors side by side, you would load the first reel into one of them and the second reel in the other one.  When you get to the end of the first reel, watch the upper right corner of the screen for a big black dot (you can still see it in some older movies). When you see it you start the other projector and say \"1\", then you see it again and say \"2\", and on \"3\" you close the dowser (lever that blocks the light) on one projector and open the other one.  The people watching the movie don't notice at all, but looking back in the theater you would see the projection beam switch from one side to the other.\n\nThis is why it came on 20 minute reels, and this worked great in theaters with only one screen, but when they started building the multiplexes they'd need a projectionist for each screen.  In the 1970s they came up with the platter system, which is basically just one huge horizontal reel that feeds from the center so you never have to rewind it.\n\nFirst you cut the leader (the film before the image) off the first reel, then splice a bunch of trailers to it and the theater logo and \"throw out your shit\" announcement reels, then you splice on the first actual reel. Rinse and repeat until the end and splice on the \"tail\" which is the film you never see after the end of the credits.  Then you put foil tape on the film just before the first trailer and just after the credits.  The projector has a sensor that detects this foil tape and will use that to automatically open the dowser once the leader (the part with the countdown) finishes running through the projector so you don't see that part.  The foil tape at the end of the movie brings the house lights back up.\n\nThe platter system took what used to be a semi-intense job that required a decent amount of skill and turned running a projector into a \"set it and forget it\" kind of thing.\n\nYou have the reel on a \"make up\" table which has a spindle for the reel and the film is coming off that reel and on to the platter where it's winding slowly.",

We still projected the movies from film, but corporate preshow stuff was off a dvd so we had a dinky little digital projector like businesses use for power point presentations or whatever. I remember one time or doofus projectionist scratched the hell out of the replacement copy of a movie he'd already damaged one print of, and since film was dead at that point another print didn't exist and they weren't willing to foot the bill to make another copy for us to negligently destroy, so they mailed us a dvd of the movie. We had to hold a clipboard in front of the digital projector lens because it had no dowser and we couldn't let guests find out they paid $10 to watch a DVD (we did warn them it wouldn't be film and was 'digital quality' whatever the fuck that was supposed to mean). I loved the weird times like that where I would get pulled from my regular duties and paid for something insane like holding a clipboard in front of the projector, or the time I got paid to watch the entire Inbetweeners movie because the rep from the company wanted an employee visible in the cinema at all times.",

DHL didn't deliver both film cans (which held three reels of film apiece; each reel is about 20 minutes), and I honestly only wanted to see the opening sequence. So, they put the first reel on the platter, I watched about twenty minutes of the movie, and that was that.\n\nI don't think any of my local theaters even have film projectors anymore, though, so they're certainly not delivering cans of film. And I've never been up in the booth since the digital changeover, so maybe they're still delivering on hard drives like in the early days of digital, but it'd make way more sense to deliver it as a download, whether from satellite or a hardline. But no good theater would ever stream something, even if they had the license, because there's too much opportunity for a bandwidth hiccup to wreck the experience.\n\nOf course, there's a lot of crappy theaters out there.",

Nobody said Universal wasn't the copyright holder; I fully maintain that Universal Studios owns the 2018 film adaptation of _How the Grinch Stole Christmas._\n\nEven so, though, if the theater has a public performance license agreement with Universal Studios, and if that agreement does not specify that the theater _must_ use a _particular_ copy of the film, then there's no reason the theater wouldn't be able to make the performances _already allowed by the license_ by using a retail copy.\n\nIn fact, public performance licenses that _explicitly_ allow the use of retail copies are not uncommon. As an example, [Criterion Pictures USA](https://www.criterionpicusa.com/) provides licensing for multiple studios--including Universal and 20th Century Fox--and its [title-by-title licensing option](https://www.criterionpicusa.com/licensing-options-for-motorcoach-services) expressly allows licensees to use their own retail copies of films for public performances, instead of having a dedicated performance copy shipped:\n\n> Criterion can provide licensing for titles on a title-by-title basis. All titles can be sourced by the Bus Company (why pay expensive shipping fees if you don't have to!) provided that your movies are:\n> \n> -Legally manufactured and/or from a legal source\n>\n> -From the list of titles that Criterion Pictures represents\n\nWe don't know what kind of license agreement the theater in the video has with Universal Studios--if any--but it's not implausible that they have a license akin to the title-by-title license offered by Criterion Pictures, on behalf of Universal.\n\nIn any case, whether or not this specific theater actually _has_ such a license, it is definitely both _possible_ and _commonplace_ for a commercial entity to get a public performance license that allows it to publicly screen retail copies of movies. It is not _categorically illegal_ to use retail copies in public screenings, provided you have a license that allows that use.",

Again, in older movies this doesn't really matter too much since no one will ever notice it. The only thing that WOULD be noticeable in pre digital movies would be sound. But depending on the movie a remastered soundscape from a 4kbluray might actually sound better anyways. Just depends on how the audio engineers set up the theater. 99.9% of people would never be able to tell the difference just sitting in the room without a side by side comparison regardless. And if we are being real sound quality in theaters dips after the first week of showing so sound is kinda whatever.",

Projectionists have pretty much all the control over how loud the movie is. SOME theaters will start to mix there audio differently than what's recommended. SOME movies are actually only allowed to have certain volume parameters set for the movie. Some theaters also go through and recalibrate there speakers often. Some do not. Usually they do so right before big releases (think avengers). So in general, the best time to watch a movie at a theater for the best sound quality is by sitting near the middle, and in the first week of a big release. Most people won't notice any if much of a difference.",

My line of thinking is mostly about older movies from the 70's and 80's and that in all reality a 4kbluray would probably look better, and sound better now. Since film always got and looked worse every copy you made of it those movies would probably look better now than they did back then. I also don't think most people would even be able to tell the difference unless they had a side by side comparison. Newer movies it would be absolutely noticeable. But I'm not even sure that studio's hand out DCP's for older movies theaters try to liscence. I'd be suprised if they do have 8k scans that are truly any better than what you can get on a 4kbluray. Film degradation is a bitch and even though 35mm is technically 4k what was shown in theaters was always closer to 1080-2k regardless. That's just my thought process tho",

Bear with me on this and I'll try to explain. \nEach cinema has a main server and then each screen has it's own individual server with a specific serial number. \nFilms arrive on a hard drive that is plugged in and content (all versions of the film, subtitled plus various sound options, 5.1, 7.1 and atmos) and ratings card is then ingested onto the main server. \nPlaylists are then created and assigned to screens, this then starts an automated transfer of the content to the screen servers.\nNow, KDMs. These are not only time stamped to only open for a certain period of time but each screen server needs a specific KDM as they're also specific to the serial number of each screen server. So unless you're playing a film at the right time, in the right screen it won't work, the projector just shuts down.\n\nSo, your question... It wouldn't work just changing times as everything is connected so it would likely fail.",

A wise man sent me [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm) and it helped me a lot understanding the quite complex word of the human race called \"sarcasm\". It is easier understanding it in person, rather than in texts, he said. And I think it is time to pass the knowledge over to you.\n\nI've been on Reddit for quite a long time. And I speak from not only my own experience, if I say upvotes are not worth anything. Upvotes and karma is just a number humans try to increase.\n\nPeople describe upvotes as an \"agreement\" with someone's opinion. However it depends on what sub you are expressing it. You can say \"Sex is good\" on an asexual sub and you'll be downvoted. However if you say it on r/porn you can get upvotes\n\nThis is an interesting behaviour I noticed around humans. All try to create a bubble around themselves of those, who are the same as them.\n\nAnd by the way \"do you think you did a good job expressing it\". You might need to get it clarified, that I am not the author of the initial comment, which sarcasm you failed to understand",

This has gone viral and it's all over various social media, and been picked up by the mainstream media. \n\nWhy don't you call up the theater and offer to be their PR person?\n\nOccam's razor. The simplest explanation is usually the truth. Rather than all these what ifs and maybe, the simplest explanation is that the theater didn't want to pay the licensing fees, and defrauded a bunch of customers into paying full price for Amazon Prime videos. $$$$ profit.\n\nHaving worked with criminals before, I can tell you they're not always the brightest. Forgetting to get more than one Prime account would be pretty typical. This is a pretty easy way to make some cash. Open up on a weekend morning, find some old movies you know are streaming, charge people $$$, load up the movie, profit.",

If they are doing this commercially, they deserve to get sued to oblivion.\n\nYou are literally what is wrong with modern society, judging a situation without any information, blindly believing a social media post and an article that literally just describes the video. Answer this, if the tiktok video said \u201cprivate hire of a movie theatre and our Amazon account won\u2019t work\u201d would it have gotten so many views? No.\n\nIf we apply Occam\u2019s razor here we can come to another perfectly simple conclusion. If a theatre is a functioning theatre, they have access to movie distribution channels. They don\u2019t need to stream a 3 year old movie from Amazon. Many theatres though, particularly at a time of reduced theatrical releases, allow you to rent out a movie theatre for personal use. \n\nBut sure, the theatre is going to risk it\u2019s entire business to show a 3 year old movie and it\u2019s totally impossible that they just charged a private group a few dollars to rent out the theatre\u2026",

Our first choice is to get a DCP (a coded hard drive of the movie). These come with code keys to unlock the time frame our theater has agreed to show the movie. There has been a number of instances where they've sent us the wrong movie, wrong code key, damaged hard drive, drive without subtitles when we specifically requested them, the list goes on. Having digital rentals and backups are a great way to have redundancy in a pinch. When we had issues like those I'm not ashamed to say I've shown a movie from Amazon Prime or an Apple rental without the crowds knowledge. I'm not claiming any of the issues I've listed are the reasons in OP's video; in fact, I would be embarrassed to have shown that on the screen. I do my best to make it look as smooth and theatrical as possible.",

You're watching a 3 year old movie using their giant screens and projectors and probably atleast 5.1 channels of surround sound still in a theater. That's the point. They probably had permission from Disney for this type of thing and will still give them revenue even though it's seemingly jank. If not they are super ballsy. Suuuuuper ballsy.",

As someone who worked in a theatre, 90% of the time they just get the movie delivered on a dongle anyway, the quality isn\u2019t going to be much different than paid streaming.\n\nIf this grinds anyone\u2019s gears, those people may not love what the cinema industry is actually expecting you to pay for. They aren\u2019t charging you $15 for the movie only, it\u2019s for \u201cthe experience\u201d in their words, it\u2019s for the feelings of viewing with a group, the camaraderie.\n\nIt\u2019s horse shit, and the cost of food is for the same reason, once people are there and see others laughing and having fun in the (usual) arcade near the concession stand, they realize they want to laugh and have fun with their family too, so money becomes less of an object.\n\nI just don\u2019t really think them projecting from Amazon Prime is the issue or \u201cgotcha\u201d some people think it is. Anyone in this theatre getting upset just doesn\u2019t quite understand they were happy to be slighted until one of the veils was lifted.\n\nTrust me, most theatre managers put ways to make you spend and save them money far before your experience, but they have to maintain the experience too or else the whole facade falls apart.\n\nThe biggest issue with this is the sheer fact they\u2019re selling a streamed service, so it would be like operating an arcade with games you only bought one copy of\u2014you have to buy the license or rent the property. But that\u2019s not really the audience\u2019s problem. \n\nEdit: The best reasoning I\u2019ve seen against this that I do agree with is streaming capacity with the internet, if it slows down that would be abysmal\u2014but regular movie projections have just as many issues with errors, getting choked up tech etc.",

They are put into this position by the studios and distributors.\n\nAll those things you just pointed out should be common knowledge by now. Especially after the struggles we heard about from theater owners during the pandemic.\n\nThe money theaters make had always been about the \"experience\". Anyone that thought otherwise is either ignorant or deluding themselves. Its always been more about the snacks, seating and arcade. \n\nMost theaters don't make any money on ticket sales until the third or fourth weekend. If it's a popular movie, even less so, as the studio extends the cut they take. So they rarely turn a profit even in the holiday third quarter. Some of them struggled to make it through the pandemic and won't be seeing profit at all for another year at least.\n\nSo the owners turn to these family nights and speciality showings to make a little extra money to keep things going. So what if they stream it? If it wasnt streamed it would've been a DVD or BluRay or as you said a file on a dongle. People just don't know that this is nothing new. But that's, as you say, the \"experience\" they are paying for, and always have.",

It all distills down to the question of whethe the copyright licensor permitted the mode of reproduction that was carried out - if not then it\u2019s an infringement and it then becomes a question of who pays if the licensor decides to seek compensation for the impermissible use. In this case, 99.9% probability Amazon\u2019s licence from the studio/licensor did not permit public screening; and likewise Amazon\u2019s terms of use with the Prime account holder (a) contained the same prohibition and (b) made the Prime account holder liable to compensate Amazon for any damages/fines etc caused by the Prime account holder\u2019s breach of those terms of use.  End result is that it\u2019s (1) A grade stupidity; (2) a breach of contract that can attract consequences; and (3) likely a criminal act (depending on the legislation in the place where the screening took place) that can attract different consequences.",

For me personally Movie theaters are bad experience.\n\nSomeone forgets to turn off their phone, other make distraction noises while eating their snack etc. All of that just ruins the movie experience.",

Be a better human). \n\nIt could be the theater itself doing this for seasonal movies, but my gut says this was a private screening.

Man gets arrested by the FBI for disobeying their content warning, unauthorized distribution or recording of content both factors in the arrest, while clearly recording what appeared to be a movie theatre having a simple technical difficulty with their equipment.  In the background you hear laughter as the man records the event, showing what appeared to be the maximum allotted users on the account or movies open at once.  The theatre has chosen not to comment at this time as it pursues charges.  Amazon spokesperson declined related feedback via comment on the event.\u201d\n\nThe attorney for the man has since released a public statement \n\n\u201cThe real issue here is that they did play the movie and it only went in 480p as it continuously buffered in 2 minute intervals for full price admission\u201d\n\nThe theatre staff members attorney also released a comment\n\n \u201cSo no one here torrents, used limewire, or Napster!!? C\u2019mon!  My client was simply following orders, meeting supply and demand. The real culprit is this evil horrible man for thinking it was funny to mock their solution, and we hope the justice system heavily demonstrates their agreement using this man as an example for legal precedents going forward\u201d",
