In places where that is a problem, non-Christians won't even be entertained and nothing will be done about it.\n\nIn this case specifically, I guarantee that a court would rule with the school, probably claiming offensiveness or that it's disrupting the class.\n\nIn short, we're fucked for quite a while, at least.",

In the [Certiorari Act of 1925](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act_of_1925), congress gave the supreme court the power to decide which cases it would hear, instead of hearing everything.  \n\nA group of 4 of the supreme court justices can grant a \"writ of certiorari\" so that a case can be heard.\n\nI propose that congress amend this law such that the four justices who grant the writ be barred from ruling on that same case.\n\nThis would make the four granting the writ be hesitant to do so if it's a personal political hobby horse.  They'd have to believe there was a persuasive legal argument that would convince the majority of the remaining 5 to agree with them on the issue.\n\nThis would most likely have prevented Roe v Wade being overturned, because the four who decided to hear it wouldn't have been able to vote for it.\n\nEdit: before you say nothing would get done, remember that almost half of supreme court cases are decided unanimously.  I'd expect those would still go basically the same as they do now.",

It would only take 3 conservative justices to gut everything. Of course if they can't agree to go forward with the case because they are afraid those 3 justices will gut things, then that means that the lower court had ruled against civil rights and that means in that district its gutted anyways.

We do not expect them to follow the law, we expect them to interpret it according to thier leanings.\n\nI believe this is a bad thing, and I think my idea would make it better, because it would leave issues that aren't a matter of clearly defined law out of the supreme court.\n\nYou're right that this would have downsides.  Roe v Wade might not have come before the supreme court at all if this rule had been in place.  But the fact that the court has overturned it seems to me to imply it should have been decided legislatively anyway.",

That\u2019s what elected officials are for, namely the House of Representatives. The Supreme Court is to uphold the law. Not make new ones. Regarding precedent, the overturning of the case of Roe v. Wade was absolutely correct because the initial ruling was not just a stretch of the fifteenth amendment, which was passed to make former slaves and the children of former slaves into United States citizens. And somehow that got stretched to the privacy clause, and that got stretched to a woman having the right to privacy over how she administers her pregnancy. And THEN, they started hashing out rules on trimesters. Well, there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution about trimesters or pregnancies or anything or the sort, except in the same Fifteenth Amendment, when it stated that anyone born inside the US is a citizen and is entitled to the rights and due process of a citizen. (Incidentally, THAT would have been an argument I could have taken easier, because a fetus is not born and therefore not entitled to rights). The other part is that according to the Bill of Rights, the Tenth Amendment, if a power isn\u2019t SPECIFICALLY granted to the federal government, such as the right over commerce, then that power is invested in the States. \nRegarding the will of the majority of citizens, many times the Supreme Court has to rule in the opposite. The case of the KKK and the one of that awful Baptist church that protested at the funerals of soldiers\u2026 it was a liberal court in these cases. But as they said, it\u2019s not the popular speech that needs protection. It\u2019s the unpopular speech. Why? Because popular opinion is fickle. And the law should not be. If you were able to suppress unpopular speech, then what is there to keep a President from becoming a regime?\nI wasn\u2019t too fond of the prayer after the game case. I\u2019m a big believer in separation of Church and State\u2026. which for Christians out there, separation of Church and State  was established by Jesus (Matthew 22:15-22). But that it was after the game was one reason why it was deemed acceptable, because it was after the game and it was an expression of his religious faith. If he REQUIRED them to stay for prayer, such was the case with school prayer in the mornings, then that is different. Kids cannot leave home room and the teacher is on the clock at that point. \nClarence Thomas is an issue. He\u2019s also a strict constitutionalist. He doesn\u2019t believe in government overreach or rulings that aren\u2019t based exactly on the constitutions and it\u2019s wording. That\u2019s not how the constitution was written. But if you look at all of the cases he\u2019s ruled on, he issues a dissent in just about every single case. This time, he wrote a separate dissent, and the others refused to conscribe to his dissent, and even blatantly added a statement to ease  peoples\u2019 minds that this case has no bearing on others. I\u2019m gay. Gay marriage is rooted in the Constitution because other citizens have the right to marry. If the right is possessed by one group, it has to be possessed by all. One group cannot tell the other that they cannot do what they have the right to do. It is inherent. That being said, if someone wanted to hold a satanic prayer after a game\u2026. And you know it\u2019s coming\u2026. If the circumstances are the same as the prior ruling, then they should have that right as well.",

A small amount of people are already angry. It will only grow. Take the whole monkeypox situation (the right trying to turn it into the new AIDS). It's obviously their way of testing the waters on LGBT+ rights. They want to make the gays look bad, when this isn't even strictly an STI. And people have already been calling that out for the bullshit it is. I hope that US citizens don't let this go any further. But after no national response (in terms of the law) to women losing rights, it is pretty disappointing. Personally, if I had the money to leave, I would've already.",

Put forth motions to require every Christian to wear a cross around their neck. if you go full on super Christian they'll realize how freaking annoying they are.",

We're talking about a public school, which generally don't give full constitutional rights to students and teachers. In particular, students are 100% not permitted to bring guns into public schools. Freedom of speech is limited, but not nearly as absolutely as the second amendment. \n\n(Search and siesure rules are also out the window, as schools don't need an ounce of probable cause and can search a student's backpack or locker just because they feel like it. You didn't mention that, just giving another example of where constitutional rights are limited in schools.)\n\nIf you're talking about outside the school, you'd have to be a little more specific on who's actually being prosecuted for anti-religious speech or expression, because I promise you it will be hard to find, and anything you come up with that may seem to support your case, will have actually have been for reasons other than the content of the expression. Is it possible that certain parts of the country will give more leeway to religious demonstrations over anti-religious demonstrations? Absolutely, and it's bullshit. But nobody is getting thrown in jail for the content of either kind of speech. It's going to be for \"disturbing the peace\" or a \"time and place\" type of law.",

      "text": "That's the hilarious thing about christianity. It's fucking everywhere and you can't ignore it.\n\nAnd yet, christians just don't seem to understand other people exist and matter. Their beliefs are theirs to have, who they are is who they are. You shouldn't and don't need to implant yourself into every human being's life. Your religion is only your beliefs. You are not god.\n\nBut christians hate that. They hate that people can be comfortable in such a stressful existence, and not have to have a fantasy escapism fetish just to get by. It concerns them when people think for themselves. Because then, they'd have to do the same, and why would they when the culture surrounding them constantly supports and justifies every action by saying their personal fantasy daddy loves it.\n\nMorality and ethics isn't a christian principle, it's a human instinct to be good. Needing fantasy to not be a terrible person, needing a culture that damns you for being you and not them, forcing upon the world a cult of hate that's only selling point is it's a bandaid to keep crazy people from killing, is only a problem that's getting worse the more people realise their childish fantasies are harming people around the world. People are leaving the bandaid and now it's coming off for the crazies.\n\nOf course, this isn't applicable to all christians, a majority just claim to be but couldn't tell you what's on the first page of the bible. They're 'fine' but look at our leaders and who supports them and tell me christianity isn't a weaponised cult for most. A child is raped and impregnated and christians are extatic about it and angry that a 10yo doesn't want to risk their life to birth something forced into them.\n\nGross. Gross culture.\n\nIn comparison, you have the satanic temple, take a google and tell me christianity isn't almost soley a train of hate, while satanism, made to counter the hateful cult, has so far been proving first-hand that indeed, being a ethical, upstanding, empathetic human being  is inherent. Sky daddy be damned, being human is better than pretending, or fantasizing. You can do good with no hidden goals.\n\nSo, here we are, again, good vs evil, humanity against fantasy. Christians don't want to see this as evil, but it absolutely is. The satanic temple would not be trying to be allowed in schools had it not been for christianity, once again, stomping all over religious freedom like they aren't a majority already, like they need to forcibly indoctrinate children into lacking critical thinking and basic cognitive abilities just to be apart of a cult.\n\nThem blocking any other religion, that's cult behavior, and has been around as long as religion.",

The Satanic Temple believes that religion can, and should, be divorced from superstition. As such, we do not promote a belief in a personal Satan. To embrace the name Satan is to embrace rational inquiry removed from supernaturalism and archaic tradition-based superstitions. Satanists should actively work to hone critical thinking and exercise reasonable agnosticism in all things. Our beliefs must be malleable to the best current scientific understandings of the material world \u2014 never the reverse.\n\nhttps://thesatanictemple.com/pages/faq",
