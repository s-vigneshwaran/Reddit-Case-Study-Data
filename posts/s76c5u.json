Nordic countries are producing a significant portion of their electricity via renewable sources, should they stop using that energy as they please? If anything, this further drives the point that we should be fighting FOR more renewable sources of energy, rather than stiff innovation for the sake of agendas. I mean, should we stop people from using the internet/tv/radio since most of the electricity provided to it is from \"dirty processes\"? Let people want what they want, fight the good fight and recognize the root of the issues, so that the solution can work for everyone.",

Another power plant not far away has recently been caught fudging numbers in a massive research scandal of international proportions.\n\nOh, and in the decommissioning process, they discovered *two new reactors* that *should* have been disposed of in the 60s but weren't. As for accidents, even here, even now we're living with the consequences of Chernobyl where we *still* have to \"downfeed\" sheep who have been grazing while in the mountains in order to make the mutton slightly less glowy. It's been 36 years. We were barely even operating a reactor ourselves when Windscale struck so that's two nuclear accidents causing problems for people who were not even remotely involved with them.\n\nI trust nuclear. I don't trust politicians to not over- or under-regulate it, corporations to cut corners on safety or humans operating it not to get lazy or complacent.",

You are either parroting something you've heard someone else say or don't understand how cars work.\n\nThe only meaningful difference between an ICE and and EV is the engine / electric motor.\n\nAn EV still has brake pads that will wear out (likely faster due to the extra weight), still will need tires (weight applies here too), still has ball joints, control arms, tie rods, springs, shock absorbers...  The list goes on.  All the mechanical stuff that makes a car a car is still there and just as basic as it's always been.\n\nIf you can change the brakes on an 80's econo-box you can do it on a Tesla.  \n\nIt's all the same basic crap.  Literally.  Not like figuratively literally but actually literally.\n\nDo you think that because an EV has no gasoline motor that the power window motors won't fail in 10 years?  Or the electric motor under the hood (floor actually) makes it somehow harder to fix dents or repair body panels after a crash?\n\nLook, I agree that some things will be more difficult, but a car is like 80% ancillary equipment that functions completely independently from the propulsion source. \n\nIf you want to repair your fancy EV yourself you most likely can.",

Every single one of them requires significant goverment subsidies, and they lose an average of 4.8 billion euros over their lifespan. The only countries that have subsidised nuclear power have done it for military reasons. Nuclear Power being presented as a \"transition energy\" is a talking point put forward by think tanks, because anyone who actually is informed on the issue knows that nuclear power is completely unviable in a competitive market.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.diw.de/de/diw\\_01.c.670590.de/publikationen/weekly\\_reports/high\\_priced\\_and\\_dangerous\\_nuclear\\_power\\_is\\_not\\_an\\_option\\_for\\_the\\_climate\\_friendly\\_energy\\_mix.html\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.kernd.de/kernd-wAssets/docs/fachzeitschrift-atw/artikel/atw\\_2019-10\\_wendland\\_peters.pdf\r  \n\r  \nNuclear power plants are more affected by climate change than any other form of energy on the market. Small changes in atmospheric temperature means that entire reactors have to be shut down. This not only causes blackouts as huge amounts of energy infastructure is no longer accessible, but also causes damage to the reactors themselves that need to be repaired over the course of weeks, as these reactors are not designed to be shut down.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.iaee.org/en/publications/ejarticle.aspx?id=2411\r  \n\r  \nNuclear power uses extremely high amounts of fresh water, which is stated to become the most precious resource of the 21st century. You're wasting one of the most valuable, essential, and irreplacable resources on the planet for an inefficient energy source.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421519300084\r  \n\r  \nWe already have the infrastructure for renewable energy: the only reason coal and gas seem remotely viable is due to significant government subsidies. As soon as government subsidisation of fossil fuels stops, and the free market takes over, fossil fuels will be unable to compete with renewable energy which is cheaper, easier to set up, more resilient to climate change, and more decentralized.\r  \n\r  \nNuclear Energy think tanks has been promising it'll improve and become safe and become economically viable for 50 years, and literally nothing has changed.",

Waves can be used to drive linear actuators though, which are marginally different from turbines.\n\nBut yeah, there are a couple different ways we can turn non-electrical energy into electrical energy, most of the time we use turbines, and photovoltaic is one of the exceptions.",

It takes a huge amount of energy to bring it up to temperature and MUCH longer to let it cool down. When you see pictures of the stereotypical nuclear reactor with the iconic cooling towers bellowing steam a fair amount is being recaptured, but not all of it. That's why nuclear power is specifically well suited for colder climates. \n\nThere are about 9 unique types of reactor layouts that are in use today around the world (about 300 designs that work on paper, but are just not cost effective/safe enough). The amount of water consumed and not recycled varies quite a lot depending on the design but I have heard the older generation 2 reactors use around 20 billion liters per year. Now that's not to say the water is destroyed, its being put back into the environment cleaner than it went in, but its still a drain on the ecosystems. \n\nSupercritical Co2 is highly efficient at converting heat into mechanical energy and then rejecting the waste heat before being recycled. Also, High pressure Co2 has a HUGE range of temperatures it can be used at (400c at 40Mpa) which means the reactor can dump more heat energy in to the coolant without risking over-pressure. And, dry Supercritical Co2 has next to zero reactivity with most metals. High pressure steam will slowly eat pipes, turbines, etc., whereas dry Supercritical Co2 wont. AND to top it all off, high radiation has a tendency to break apart compounds (water turns into Hydrogen and Oxygen). These gasses during normal operations are recombine and put back into the system, BUT if something went wrong like, oh I dunno, a tsunami hits the structure. All that hydrogen and oxygen is free to float around and eventually explode. That's what happened to fukushima daiichi, the explosion everyone saw (and began to panic over) was a buildup of hydrogen and oxygen in the framework of the building. Co2 when bombarded with radiation is MUCH less likely to break up due to the carbon bonds.",

The control rods are raised and lowered into the reactor core, this helps manage the reaction and prevents pressure from building too quickly. Think of it like a big oval, there\u2019s all these little uranium fuel rods in the bottom half, and bigger boron rods in the top, the boron rods can lower down through holes precisely their size to manage the reaction. \n\nThe hot gas heats up water, the steam pushes a turbine. Cold gas and water keep the reactor cool. \n\nThere are four steps for the containment of a nuclear reactor:\n\n- The casing around the fuel\n\n- The metal fuel cladding tubes\n\n- The reactor and the coolant system\n\n- The containment building\n\nThe containment building is airtight and should be able to withstand an airliner colliding into it. \n\nBack in the 80s and 90s nuclear power was demonized as unsafe, you can see it in shows from back then. Lisa Simpson protests nuclear power many times although (had Homer not been involved in it) it would be much cleaner than any of the other options at the time. Chernobyl and Fukushima made the public opinion even worse, but Chernobyl was negligence on many different levels and let\u2019s be honest, a 9.0 earthquake and then big ass tsunami coming in at Fukushima probably wasn\u2019t expected by the Japanese. Nuclear power began operating commercially in the US in \u201858, there are currently 94 reactors in 56 plants and there have been three fatalities from one explosion in 1961. Nuclear power gets safer and safer but because of the name and the idiots who ran the Soviet government it\u2019s the energy we should ban, not coal, not gas, we should ban the clean one in an age where large cities have a permanent smog from how bad air pollution is.",
