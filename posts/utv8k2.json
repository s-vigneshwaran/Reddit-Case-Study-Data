If they actually believed in Satan it would be one thing, it's not metaphorically believing in Satan, it's using a popular religions key words against it for the greater good. Atheists aren't against having beliefs. You can believe in the human race, believe in taxes, wtf ever. Beliefs aren't just religious.

They manage to make the theocrats outraged, an when they're outraged they are so much easier to expose for their hypocrisy. Also, think about the headline \"Satanists are more moral than the church\". \n\n>So is it not logical that if you say you are a Satanist that I shouldn't think you actually believe in a literal Satan?\n\nIt's not logical, because you'd be completely incorrect with your assumption. \n\n>So it's just to make people mad or piss them off?\n\nIt's to make the theocrats mad, which is inherently a worthy goal, but it's also a marketing ploy. It gets attention on them, which allows them to spread their message with ease. They also hold true to their 7 satanic tenets, which are honestly better than the 10 commandments. \n\n>Why even bother calling yourself anything more than a rebel then?\n\nBecause calling yourself a rebel doesn't get you on the news to show the hypocrisy of theocrats.",

I don't think any of what the user you're responding to is anti semitism - I think any anti-theist will eventually say something that can be misconstrued for true anti semitism.\n\nI think what a lot of ignorant people focus on is how Rendazza has undeniably defended a lot of [right wing extremists.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Randazza)\n\n>Randazza represents multiple far-right figures, including conspiracy theorists Alex Jones, Mike Cernovich, and Chuck Johnson; and neo-Nazi, white supremacist, antisemitic conspiracy theorist Andrew Anglin.[11][12][13] Randazza defended a participant in the planning of the violent Unite the Right rally who used the pseudonym \"Kristall.night\" (cf. Kristallnacht). Kristall.night claimed that a federal subpoena against the app Discord following the deadly rally would reveal her identity and expose her to potential harm through doxing.[14]\n\n>Randazza has defended Anglin in a lawsuit filed by a Jewish realtor in Whitefish, Montana, whom Anglin had published the name and address of on his neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer. Randazza had argued that Anglin was not responsible for the subsequent harassment and death threats the woman received, as the personal information was protected as free speech. This claim was rejected by U.S. District Court Judge Dana L. Christensen, who noted that Anglin was actively encouraging and participating in the plaintiff's harassment, and that calls to violence against a private individual are not protected speech.[15][16]\n\nI'm not saying that constitutes him as an antisemite, everyone has a right to a lawyer and free speech is extremely difficult to talk about much less defend. Stochastic terrorism also has a very fine understanding and isn't illegal, but we all know the right wing extremists do it in their main stream media.\n\nEven the ACLU has \"protected\" Nazis in free speech cases.\n\nHowever, that being said, I could never defend Alex Jones or other extremists who hate that different people have the same freedoms.\n\nFree speech is tough, because it's IMPERATIVE that any impositions on free speech can't be used against people who aren't hateful extremists that just want better for all people. I honestly do think that the stereotypical free speech lawyer recognizes that potential spiral, and genuinely thinks they're stopping that.\n\nAlas, the right wing extremists always hide behind plausible deniability, though.",

I didn't know I was ADHD!\" Well, the difference is that I do that dozens of times a day while they do it once in a while.\n\nThe same exists for the [dark triad](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad) characteristics. The extent in which they do shitty things is just more often than the rest of us. The problem with the stigma of \"evil\" is that people are more likely to fall into their stigma than to fight out of it.\n\nAlso, if I say, for example, \"Trump is evil,\" I've just effectively made 28% of the population roll their eyes and ignore me.",
