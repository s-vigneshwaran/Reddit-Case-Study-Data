Hear me out:\n\nFrom toddlerhood-thru-late-elementary, Christian children believe in:\n\n* Jesus\n* Santa\n* Tooth Fairy\n* Easter Bunny\n\nIn the eyes of a child, Santa's \"miracles\" are no less real, powerful, or magical than those of Jesus. It's bona fide polytheism by any metric.\n\nLater, children are told \"Nah, Jesus is the only real one. Sorry, you're monotheistic now!\"\n\nMore to your point, people are conditioned to not merely accept a set of static fabrications. They've been conditioned to accept mutable, evolving, and/or new fabrications--pliable in the hands of the fabricators--making them even more vulnerable to brand-new nonsense.",

There's an organized effort to make the United States of America un-governable using bullshit on TV and bullshit in social media. It is working, and we are losing. \n\nYou almost stop noticing how bad it has already gotten. We have probably lost a million lives to a deadly disease we know how to protect ourselves against, one that we have a vaccine for. Last year, we suffered $95 Billion in damage from an unfolding ecological cataclysm that we have the tools and money to solve. People are poor, people need work, businesses have jobs they need filled, goods that people want are sitting in storage, but all we can agree on as a nation is to cut the taxes of the wealthy and maybe re-pave a few roads.\n\nWhoever is organizing it attempted the first information-age coup against a first world nation, and was almost successful. But we aren't really going after them, beyond a toothless, symbolic investigation. They learned from their mistakes and are hard at work on another attempt while **laws intentionally designed to undo the specific protections that stopped the last coup attempt** are being passed in states nationwide. If something like January 6th happens again after the next presidential election, it's hard to imagine them losing again.\n\nWe know what is happening. We know the death and destruction we've already experienced and how it's only a fraction of what awaits us if we don't act now, but our two political parties are useless to stop it:\n\n* One has been coopted by the attackers, and has an irrational, almost religious conviction that the only way government can fix anything is to reduce taxes on wealthy people and that will make things get better on their own. \n* The other political party has an irrational, almost religious conviction that the only way to fix anything is incrementalism- to find excuses that let them do as little as possible, as slowly as possible, and THAT will cause things to get better on their own. \n\nBut this won't get better on its own, **nobody is doing anything about it,** and I honestly don't have any idea how we can change that.",
