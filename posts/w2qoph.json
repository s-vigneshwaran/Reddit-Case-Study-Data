  "text": "As an atheist, I find it infuriating how Christians are free to openly express their beliefs, but we atheists must keep our atheism to ourselves\nTo me, I find that to be complete hypocrisy from Christians. I also think that it is very controlling and intimidating behavior. Christians are free to 'spread the word of god', but the minute atheists come out, they are given backlash. I thought the Christian Bible stated 'do unto others as you would like to be done to yourself'. Christians can express their views without criticism, but us atheists dear not come out about our atheism.\n\nEDIT: I know some of you are saying that this applies in the US or that you don't receive backlash for your atheism. I'll have you informed that I am a black African, and in the black community, there is a strong emphasis on religion, primarily Christianity. Those that are nonbelievers are usually ostracized from the community. This is what makes it extremely difficult for black atheists to come out about their atheism.\n\nEDIT 2: Looking back at my post, maybe 'infuriating' was the wrong choice of wording to use in my title. I will be honest that this post is mainly based on my own personal experiences with Christianity. This is because I come from a Christian conservative family and have Christianity almost constantly shoved down my throat. The part that I find 'infuriating' is the fact that I am discouraged from speaking out against this. This post is mainly to describe the situation of atheists from religious backgrounds/families that are forced into silence.",

She would likely need to take down the religious decor and refrain from talking about religion at work (that would be the \u201ccoaching\u201d). People rarely get fired for something like this unless it\u2019s extreme. This is just a rogue employee and probably just misguided management. \n\nIf HR/management did nothing and or ignored the claim of \u201chostile work environment\u201d, then they could be in for some serious legal issues. Just depends on how far you want to take it at that point. But it\u2019s the same as sexual harassment where some coworkers has nude pictures hanging in their cubicle. I don\u2019t think religion in itself could/would be considered hostile but combined with the other facts it could be.",

Because they're intellectually dishonest, they'll change their reported beliefs if you challenge them before they've established them. However if you can get them to lay out their beliefs one by one, once you start deconstructing their church brick by brick all that they can do is become hostile and thus admit that they're not here for tolerance at all.",

That they can't seem to recognize that the religious pretense used to galvanize them is nothing more than a facade to allow a few to amass incomparable wealth makes it that much harder to actually stop. Now that their easy majority is threatened and they recognize that they cannot inflict their insanity on us through democratic majority, they've cheated as the system is broken and rendered any reasonable opposition totally ineffective. We have to fix it. \n\nFor our part we can vote and participate in political discourse, but frankly I see clearly that's not nearly enough. Revolution would result almost certainly in a worse Christian theocracy. Thus, as your comment implies, the supposed moral high ground isn't any solace. However, I'm not sure how else to actually convince these people than plainly showing their hypocrisy for what it is... I do feel some satisfaction when I know I've won an argument, but it is a truly hollow pride unless they're convinced. Even just waiting for better ideas to slowly dominate as the common person grows more enlightened is dauntingly failing as they try to regress our already insufficient education. When I try to plot a good course for humanity in my head, I become very jaded. There's simply too many broken people and far more trying to break the others than there are those helping fix the whole mess.",

But so long as they're not actively murdering the people they hate with their own two hands, these preachers still qualify as \"mainstream\", and are in fact entitled to tax exemptions for doing this.\n\nIf this preacher graciously says that gay people should get to *live* (so long as they promise to remain celibate, hate themselves for daring to be the way that God made them, and give up on trying to acquire anything resembling human rights), he might get bumped all the way up to \"moderate\" and \"progressive\" for his \"daring new message of unity and reconciliation\".\n\n\nAnd yet the moment an atheist politely expresses her frustration with this state of affairs, she is immediately labelled as \"extremist\" or \"fundamentalist\" or \"militant\".\n\nDoes that seem fair to you?",

When we find other, better ways, we will change to those.\n6. I once had a boss ask me \"How do you know someone is an atheist?  They'll tell you.\"  I didn't feel very much privilege. \n7. Wow, now your intolerance is really showing.  You hate a group of people, but you've transferred the reason to \"free speech\". You're not allowed to *say* how much you hate these people, so your freedom of speech is infringed. I think you're actually afraid of the responses you might get. Too bad, everyone has a right to free speech, so you're going to get responses.",

After all, if we got here without a god once, there is always the possibility in a Universe of infinite time and where matter is animated to into life that we will return to life. I read in the Blind Watchmaker that when you have an endless amount of time, statistical improbabilities become more probable.\n\nTo take an example from that book, given enough time, a scenario *could* and *will* eventually arise where a cow is catapulted over a moon, for instance.",

Since that nothingness (which he likens to a deep, peaceful sleep) caused us no pain or discomfort, we should not fear the same nothingness that will follow our own demise.\"\n\nI need to find that little book again.

Life doesn't need a god or require magic to have that kind of mystery and connection to it. \n\n>Do you believe in some form of karma?\n\nI do think life tends to teach us lessons, yes. In that sense I believe in karma. And also in a sort of reverse karma where the built-in automatic mechanisms of the Universe ultimately set things right and heal all damages done to us by always providing infinite chances of our reanimation. So no matter what is done to us as one lifeform in this Universe, it will always make it up to us as another lifeform down the line.",

                  "text": "The Satanist approach is to shock religious people by helping challenging their core assumptions. I have met so many people that believe Satan is a real thing. LaVeyan Satanism, which is the mainstream satanic \"religion,\" is nontheistic and just basically serves as a framework for atheists to challenge the presence of religion in society. It also highlights a moral code in 7 tenants. If you search the Satanic Temple, it will pop up: https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/about-us\n\nIn the end their are several approaches. I don't push Satanism due to the semantic response from religious people. I have to work with religious people daily, so creating friction would not be good for the longevity of my career. I deal with faith based decisions on an individual basis, and if anyone tries hard to impress me with their religion, then I hit them with hardcore cognitive dissonance. For example, did you know there is no contemporary evidence of Jesus' existence? Here's a link: https://www.atheists.org/activism/resources/did-jesus-exist/\n\nAlso, I find an effective technique is highlighting that our \"practical reality\" does not necessitate a God. Science aims to create repeatable testable models, and as far as we know, there is nothing that can't be described in this way. Outcomes of different systems of empirical reality always produce repeatable results. A God would have the ability to overwrite natural laws when it would see fit. Practically speaking, even if there was a coexisting God with natural laws, there is no evidence that outputs of systems given certain inputs require divine intervention. Everything can be mapped out as statistical likelihoods given underlying fundamental laws. Therefore, practically speaking, there is no God. The burden of proof scientifically is on proving that there is a system that requires divine intervention. I have never seen a religious rebuttal to this fact: Christian, Muslim, or otherwise.",

Advertising. A constant stream of advertising aimed at vulnerable people who are confused or have questions about life. Don't think that material works? Tell that to people who come out of prison religious. Advertising works. I guarantee you they wouldn't be doing it if it didn't work on a certain percentage of the population. It's just like advertising. Religious flyers in mail boxes work. They work on vulnerable people, sick people, ignorant people, aging people contemplating the end of life, people with little to lose, people who have had a hard life and who are looking for answers, etc. \n\nBy saying we shouldn't do anything you're ceding all those potential converts to atheism to religion. And then you're going to come back to this sub and complain with everybody else about all the stupid religious people in the world.\n\nYou're telling us it's too much to make flyers or a small book but it's really the least we can do. It's the least we can do. Especially in this day and Age of digital media. I mean, don't even come at me with that. \n\nYour philosophy nevers comes to people's minds if your philosophy isn't out there in some digestible form. Constantine the Second would have never attributed his victory and spiritual epiphany to Christianity if Christian doctrine wasn't being widely dispersed in some form or another at the time of his epiphany. He never would have attributed anything to Christianity because it never would have been on his mind. Content works.",

And then if *you* don't walk on eggshells, you're the bad guy because somehow *you* ruined the fun by triggering their toxic bullshit.\n\nAnd the fact we do that is what gives them room to do what they do! They take that opening to bully and abuse others, hoping we'll be too shy or respectful to push back on their shit.\n\nIt's infuriating. I'm at the point where I have no tolerance for any of this shit. They're going to hear *exactly* what I think of them from here on out, no tiptoeing. No gentle language. No \"I respect your beliefs, but.\" Because *I don't*. Not anymore. I respect beliefs when those beliefs aren't forced on me.

When they would suggest they be exterminated they\u2019d follow it up with \u201cby God\u201d and be applauded. There are many, many more Christian\u2019s you\u2019d think that want you dead than you even know. We are in their eyes evil by default, not just fallen sinners but a \u201cworldly\u201d source of evil for them to fight against. \n\nSometimes we can be seen as people who are pitied, but the stronger you appear in your own convictions the more of a threat you are and are treated as an enemy. If you\u2019re willing to succumb to them they will treat you more like a person, if not you may as well be a cockroach in God\u2019s kitchen waiting for their swift boot.

Also, it's a consistent gathering place for community to have another \"family\" and get support when it's needed. If you're a slave, a modern American who is Black or Latino, or really any historically mistreated group, religion was usually the one thing that kept you going, a belief that one day you'd be saved and love an easy existence in the afterlife. \n\n- If something bad happens, God only tests his strongest followers. Don't question His plan, because this is happening for a reason, and you need to see the lesson He's trying to teach you. You need to pray for guidance and strength, and above all else, have faith. This is all a part of His plan. \n- If something good happens, it's God blessing you for being strong in your faith. Because you didn't turn your back on God when He tested you, you are now rewarded for your trust and faith. God is good! Praise Him! \n- If life is unfair, you are treated fairly in the eyes of God and in the afterlife. All of us are equals in the eyes of God and we will all be judged. But you can't blame those who treat you poorly... God says we need to forgive them, because they do not understand what it is that they do. Show them grace, and try to bring them into the Lord with you. \n- If you are down and out, you can depend on your Church community to give you guidance and resources. \n\nRich white folk on the other hand think \"if you were as hard working/smart/disciplined/devout/pious/donate/whatever as I am, you too would enjoy all these gifts from God that I have, like a top college education my parents paid for, a fancy house my grandparents gave me the down payment for, the fancy job my uncle got me, and the overall posh life. None of this was given to me, it was earned through hard work, faith, and trusting the Lord to return my tithe tenfold.\"",

That is invalidating their belief in a way - they\u2019re not challenging you when they say god bless you or whatever. You are challenging them when you say it\u2019s not real, though. \n\nI think that\u2019s something a lot of us atheists ought to realize.\n\nThough not a perfect metaphor it\u2019s a bit like trans rights. Trans people being trans and celebrating and talking with each other doesn\u2019t invalidate anyone. Talking to them about your lack of belief in trans existence, however, is invalidating. \n\nThose who don\u2019t believe should recognize they should stay out of the conversation. Otherwise you\u2019re actively starting a disagreement. In my experience most of us are doing it without realizing we\u2019re trying to change the narrative from religiousness to atheist, but that, itself, is invalidating. \n\nAtheists don\u2019t have religious beliefs, you can\u2019t invalidate them. You can invalidate religious beliefs though.\n\nHonestly my fellow atheists seem like they have just as big a victim complex as Christians do.",

I understand pushing back and feeling hurt when people tell you you're going to hell, and there are a lot of issues with Christianity in America specifically (can't speak to other countries)... But \"I can't tell people that their way of coping with grief is bullshit\" doesn't seem like a hill to die on. Would you tell a Hindu, Buddhist, or Sikh commenting on their loved one being reincarnated that they were wrong? If yes at least you're internally consistent but it's still kind of a dick move. This isn't an oppressed atheists thing, it's a social graces thing.\n\nNot being able to hold office is fucked up. Having people feel comfortable telling you you're going to hell is fucked up, but at least with American Evangelicals that isn't reserved solely for atheists they tell everyone they're going to hell. Being forced to take part in religious practices you don't believe in*, especially in public spaces is also fucked up... But not \"um, actually\"ing someone who makes a statement about their faith that doesn't impact you**, is just common decency. \n\n*I caveat this because I do think that participating in other people's practices in some instances is good and moral. I'm personally a \"guy who resonates with the teachings of Christ but definitely doesn't have anything nailed down on the spiritual front and is disgusted with and doesn't participate in mainstream Christianity because they don't walk the walk\" but when I've gone to religious services for other people I participate as is expected because I chose to be there. So in the above example if gramps was a Christian and you were like at his wake, maybe don't tell everyone he's just ceased to be. Similarly, I try to acknowledge others' beliefs by letting them know that I'm thinking about/praying for/sending vibes their way as befits their personal paradigm.\n\n**obviously if their religion is attempting to revoke your rights, or your ability to pursue life, liberty, and happiness, or force you to do something you don't need/want to then they can get fucked. This statement is in no way a defense of the rise of white christofascism in America or the \"west\".",

Mentioning my lack of belief in god in a moment like a funeral or family remembrance is soothing to me in the same way religion is soothing to others - I respect their beliefs but I should also be able to verbally express mine.",

I'm African, but am white and very europeanised so take everything I say with a boatload of salt... This is just what I learnt studying religion at uni. \n\nWhen the colonialists came, they came with big ships and guns and all sorts of technology unknown to pastoral Africans. The Africans had their own religions, which were very related to natural forces - deities of harvest, rain, etc., as well as a creation myth. They saw their gods as being related to the day to day.\n\nNow come the colonialists with their global outlook and far-reaching myths of Christianity. Plus all the tools and fire power they used to colonise and pillage the continent.\n\nSo the Africans (still feeling bad about the generalisations, sorry) adopted elements of Christianity. They kept their own gods, and prayed to them and honoured them with regards to groundlevel day to day stuff. The Christian god, they saw as the global god, uninvolved in the day to day but more powerful and often less caring.\n\nThe two were not contradictory in their minds. Over time, as Africa modernised, the old gods took on less of a role, but are still very much present - at least in South Africa, where I live. Traditional religion is alive and does not conflict with Christianity somehow.\n\nDefinitely an interesting state of affairs. Religion never ceases to amaze me. It's a truly fascinating, albeit often fucking terrible, aspect of humanity.",

All religions are immoral for this reason. I think religions do serve as a positive sense of community in people's lives, however I see that as a negative, a condemnation of regular atheistic life, it is not being built properly, so that people feel a need for an external source of community, and religions are abusing and exploiting that flaw in current society. I tell them that personal spiritual belief doesnt affect me in any negative way, But that is not religion. To have beliefs shared, beliefs must be spread and imposed on others. The mere act of writing your spiritual beliefs down in a book no longer makes them personal, it makes them an institution, and organization of religion, and that is where the problems come from.",

I used to respect that we all had different beliefs, but they refuse to coexist. They say they support the ideals of free speech, but silence us at every turn. They're the biggest hypocrites in the world, and I look forward to a future where christianity is mocked as largely as they have condemned Atheism. I have no respect for any christian church anymore. I don't care what charity work they do. I don't care that they brought food boxes to my family when we were poor. I used to be grateful, but I understand now it's just a drop compared to their anti-American efforts. And covering up things that shouldn't have been. They would happily see their artificial \"end times\" instead of helping to build a world that doesn't end by the human hand in the first place. They are mentally ill, and need to be committed because they are talking to someone that isn't there, and basing their entire lives off of it.  \n\nI love the believer, but I hate the belief. :)",

Along with backing him into a corner pretty aggressively. Nobody talks shit about my partner like that in my own home. \n\nWe have recently come to find that apparently he told her ELEVEN YEAR OLD BROTHER \"I'm glad you're not gay\"\n\nHe told us this kinda anxiously at a very colorful birthday party where I was actually the only person there that was both Cis and Straight. \n\nHe's not my brother or kid, but I am protective of him. Don't get to see him much because they live halfway across the country but he's the sweetest kid and so smart.\n\nImagining all the trauma that can come from the conflict of \"I think I like boys\" and \"I don't want to disappoint my Father\". Hell even if he is straight, it's not exactly great to portray gay people as something you're \"glad someone isn't\"",

Like most in this subreddit, I also grew up in a quite religious and conservative family here in the Philippines, but only became an atheist a few years ago (22 now). Some of my close friends know, but some of my family or relatives may never understand it, due to their strong beliefs. Even in the country, it seems that hate has grown towards the atheist community for being \"satan worshippers\" or dumb enough to not believe in their God, and etc. Religion can be embedded to one's culture and has been the common way of living or coping mechanism by people for hundreds of years, and it does not differ from what's happening today. \n\nFortunately, there are some groups and other people who openly accept us and are actually curious with one's upbringing ot stories. It might be difficult or seem impossible for some, but what we can do best is to try informing others about atheism and its common misconceptions, while also understanding where others come from.\n\nNot sure if this might help in trying to understand others, but best of luck to you and take care, friend.",

However, all Christians deep down know their beliefs are really \u201ca house built on sand,\u201d so they are very easily offended. For example, if you were to tell the high school valedictorian that they aren\u2019t book-smart, they probably wouldn\u2019t be offended by that, but say that same person was sorta gullible and someone called them gullible, they could be offended by that because they know there\u2019s some truth behind it.\n\nAlso emotion, there\u2019s no real emotion behind our beliefs. It\u2019s like gravity or physics or anything else. But for them, their beliefs define who they are at their very core and elicit an extreme and loud response. And we all know a louder minority is often stronger than a quieter majority.",

I never messaged her to call her out on her hypocrisy, but I wish I had. \n\nOddly enough with her religion being quite conservative, it's a bit telling she's already been divorced once and the little atheist who could is still married....",

I\u2019m 54 now, so unless it\u2019s going to be a deathbed conversion I don\u2019t see it happening. :)",

The fear of going to hell or not having an amazing afterlife isn't required for you to be a \"good person.\" I think raising kids to treats others the way they would like to be treated is a good start. Instilling empathy and a general understanding of others is crucial to have less main characters running around. \n\nI'd love to get into a conversation/debate with a religious person that I'm close to but I don't actually have any. My best friend used to go to youth group as a kid but I've never heard of him going to church as an adult. I feel like most religious beliefs can be struck down with some simple logic. I think a huge issue with defeating them logically is that religion is taught at a young age so for them to accept your logic they would need to admit to being wrong for most of their lives. Unfortunately you will see a lot of people are too stubborn to admit such a thing. I imagine it could also cause some family problems and it might just be easier for them to keep going along with it. \n\nI don't really care what other people choose to do but I wish there was a bit more separation of church and state. It seems like sometimes science is thrown to the wind in favor of whatever will shut up the Christian masses. If your beliefs are against abortions, then great don't ever get one but don't try to push that on to everyone else.",

For atheists, we simply don\u2019t believe in any specific god(s), normally from a combination of a rational calculation and a gut feeling, but it\u2019s not a belief to which we have a super strong emotional attachment.  Most atheists are also agnostic, and don\u2019t claim to know with any certainty that we are correct.  So, when someone starts preaching the existence and goodness of god, we simply don\u2019t agree, no hard feelings, perhaps we even think \u201chey, maybe they\u2019re right, who knows\u201d.  But for the religious believer, they generally have strong emotional attachment to the existence of their god(s), and the rightness of their beliefs, and they\u2019re more often gnostic in their beliefs.  When we say that we don\u2019t believe god(s) exist, our assertion challenges the very personal relationship they\u2019ve built with their god(s).  They typically have a much stronger, and more defensive response, because they\u2019re not (as often) applying rationality to their belief.  They\u2019ve been christvibing for years, maybe their whole life.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair or equitable, but I do understand why Christians (and most other religious believers) tend to have this uneven response.",

It's a hard process and takes many years and many details to clear your mind out of... Like, I've been an atheist for like 13 years and I still end up thinking sometimes \"oh my god\"... That's just an expression by this point, I police myself not to say expressions that have anything to do with religion because it's those small unperceptible details that make a big change at the end of the process",

Because of that, she was bullied, harassed, had drugs planted in her locker, etc to the point that her parents finally withdrew her from school and finished her education up at home.\n\nI've occasionally worn my black tee w/ \"ATHEIST\" printed on it into town a few times.  While anyone who's actually said anything to me has been positive thus far, even when it comes from theists, I've certainly had some death glares.\n\nMy wife is terrified that the neighbors will find out that I'm an atheist and either do something to the house of shoot the dogs.  Upon moving here to be w/ me, her first day at her new job, one of the company owners stopped by to say hi and introduce himself.  According to her, the owner starting ranting about how much he hated atheists which shocked her.  So of course, at the annual Xmas party, I bowed my head when the owner asked people to pray.  Although she's pretty sure certain others in the office are atheists, they don't talk about it for obvious reasons.\n\nThere's plenty of reasons for atheists to worry.",

Then [these damn things](https://wvexplorer.com/attractions/other-attractions/coffindaffers-crosses/) are all over the place here.  There's a set right at the bottom of the hill from me.  The dickhead farmer advertises an annual event on his property where these are located and he puts the banner for it BEHIND these crosses so you HAVE to look at them to read the banner.  Hell, one kid up in Pennsylvania was sentenced to something like a 100 hrs of community service and banned from the internet for 6 months because he posted a pic of himself getting a mock BJ from a kneeling Jesus statue intended to look like he was in the garden praying to his daddy.  Of course there's no official blasphemy laws but since it was on private property and despite the fact he did absolutely no damage whatsoever to the statue, they convicted him under public nuisance or some shit like that.\n\nGenerally speaking, the more rural and conservative the local population an area is, the more Jesus you're likely to see Jesus shit.  Hence the Bible Belt is way more about Jesus than say Vermont.  Go to someplace like NYC or LA, you'll see Jesus shit but not like you would in Mississippi or Ohio.",

Later that day they sent me an email asking me to resign the painting on the front \"so that it has more value\" (their words - I did it on the back of this particular painting but forgot tonsign the front) and then I responded back wondering when a good/day time to pick it up was. Instead of giving me an answer, they didn't email me back until Christmas and the email only contained Christian scriptures and that \"Jesus/Christ is the reason for the season\". Still have not recieved any confirmation from them about the thing they needed me to do.\n\nI now regret giving them the painting and will not do anything for them further since they can't even give me simple responses and not some religious BS after I've clearly stated I'm not interested in their beliefs. \n\nBut I am glad about how I made the painting though, because it was a bald eagle with an upside down US flag, signaling distress.

Most other religions have this, and therefore encourage/support evangelism to broaden their customer base and keep the money rolling in.\n\nWhen you have this structure in place consistently over time, it becomes normal to openly promote your religion on a regular basis. It's also normal to employ people to do this very thing.\n\nBecause atheism doesn't have a structured incentive to \"spread the gospel\", open and proactive communication about the (lack of) belief is seen as more of a counter-culture behavior. And honestly, looking at this post and responses, it IS a counter-culture behavior. \"You can do it, so fuck you, I can too.\" This kind of open movement won't grow as quickly without self-reinforcement and a reward system.\n\nIf you can weave atheism into capitalism so there is an incentive to recruit, expand, and openly push atheist ideals, you might grow a force strong enough to shift our culture faster. Otherwise, we just need to wait for a critical mass of people to see through the horse shit on their own.",

Moreover, after that God was angry not at Himself for making such sin-prone people and teaching them badly despite all his best efforts, but at those people, as if the sin was borne inside them with no help from God at all, despite the people, the serpent and the whole world being also created by him?  \n\n\nI'll give you some ground here: I accept that people were possibly created by some outside personified force, which was pretty powerful. But, judging by the Bible itself, this force was neither Almighty (able to do anything) nor All-seeing (knowing everything, including future), and also had a very bad temper.",

And because Satan is so good at manipulation, and because we also have free will to make our own choices, they CHOSE to listen to the serpent and disobey God.

Was there another devil to deceive him into doing it? Someone whose methods were more effective than God's \u2014 and God made and taught angels to be good?  \n\n\nAlso, I don't know where you come from with this \"serpent was Satan\" stuff. Upon knowing that the serpent beguiled the first woman, He clearly punished THE SERPENT, making him crawl on his belly and eat dust till the end of his days. Last time I checked, Satan isn't known for doing that.  \nAlso, a footnote, for a benevolent deity God starts to be prone to fits of rage a bit too early in the Bible \u2014 not quite the \"slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt\", but animal cruelty is a nice start.  \n\n\nPlease, before you look into the Bible to find more answers, just read this as a logical person. The gist of my argument is: Everything that happens, comes from the God, because at the beginning, there was literally nothing else. If somebody on Earth makes an evil choice \u2014 it can't come from anywhere else but God, because He's the Universal Source. You may repeat and repeat that the sins come from inside men, or from Satan \u2014 but men are God's creations, and Satan is God's creation. It's ridiculous to think that such powerless creatures as humans can go against God's Will. Even if He doesn't force His will on people, WHERE DOES THE EVIL IN THEM COME FROM if they are made good?  \nWHERE  \nDOES  \nTHE   \nEVIL  \nCOME  \nFROM?",

God created Lucifer yet He did not stay good, so the thinking that things created by God stay good forever without the possibility of becoming evil is not true. God created for there to be a possibility of evil, and because Lucifer lost his love for God and decided He didn't want to serve God as an Angel, that turned his pure heart to evil. So when He tricked Eve by taking on the form of a serpent, that evil then entered mankind in the form of sin. \n\nJust because He is God doesn't mean that we can't rebel against Him, we have that choice to rebel against His commands and follow our own choices because He wants us to have that choice. Yes He made everything and all things come from Him, ( with the exception of sin because He only made a world where sin was a possibility) but that does not mean that everything will stay good. Lucifer became evil on His own, not because that evil came from God. We will never truly understand this, but I hope you can see just a little clearer.",

Why does God take full credit for creating humans and the world, but when humans start to sin, it's suddenly their own problem and fault? He may not made them sinners originally, but He built in their heads the logic to become sinners, and provided the environment for this logic to trigger.  \nOr is there no logic to someone becoming a sinner? Does it happen randomly and not upon conscious decision? If so, the human is not guilty that the coin in his head fell tails up.  \n\n\nAlso, did you skip the part where I explained that the serpent couldn't be Satan, or otherwise it's strange that God punished the serpent and not Satan? The story never says: \"But Satan, the fallen angel, envied Adam and Eve and decided to snatch them from God's grace. He turned into a great serpent and approached Eve...\" No, when the serpent appears, the Satan isn't even introduced yet, and isn't spoken about for a long time \u2014 he appears, what, in the Book of Job? Certainly never again in Genesis. Or the serpent, for that matter.  \n\n\nI know that it's safer for you to stick to your beliefs, as those not only make you \"a lesser fool\" in your own eyes, but also help you to be a part of your community.

Eve was tempted, and she gave into it and so it really was her fault. This then resulted in her sinning against God. God created us to suppress that sinful nature that we got from Eve's mistake and desire to do good and obey Him instead. He never built logic in their mind to sin, that sin came from our desires and us giving into them. Just like if a mom prohibited her son from eating candy, but he decides to give into his desires instead listen to his mom \n\nAlthough In genesis it never states that the serpent is Satan, in Revelation 12:9 says \"that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray\", hopefully I don't have to explain as to why this scripture supports my claim and you can come to that conclusion on your own.\n\nBesides, race and slavery have nothing to do with what I believe in.

I\u2019ve found strategies to help with this that I can share, and I\u2019ve helped quite a few people reduce their relationship with their religion / god or to at least be more accepting of my position. It\u2019s also annoying that it feels like kid gloves but children need to be spoken to like children to grow right?\n\n1. I always try to keep the conversation based on my own confusion with the religion, this way they can\u2019t feel attacked personally and if they are a \u201cgood practitioner\u201d they will feel it\u2019s their duty to have the conversation with you to help \u201cbring you to god\u201d. If the questions brought to them force them to state their positions on the multiple contradictions, it tends to force them to acknowledge flaws (internally and not externally). It generally gets the wheels turning and IF they are capable of critical thought, it helps to break some of the spell. \n\n2. Help them see ethics and morals as a non-religious concept. This almost always helps to dispel their misgivings about atheism. \u201cCan\u2019t I be a good person just because I want to?\u201d, \u201cAm I really a good person if I\u2019m only doing it under duress/threat of hell?\u201d, & \u201cWould a just god really punish a good person with eternal damnation just because they chose not to believe?\u201d are always useful questions. \n\n3. Emphasize that you don\u2019t care what their beliefs are, and that they are allowed to think and feel how they like, but with the caveat of \u201cas long as you aren\u2019t forcing your beliefs on others\u201d. This helps them to feel that they are allowed to have their beliefs and practices, but sets a very clear line that you want fairness for others and yourself. It helps remove misgivings about their being attacked, and since religion =/= morality (covered above) you can agree to disagree on certain points (opinions on whether beings have souls or w/e else). \n\n4. Patience and consistency. Be yourself, be willing to have these conversations openly with those who want to have them, and let your openness, fairness, and patience speak for you. \n\nI\u2019m also a black man and understand the hardships of having these conversations with members of the black community. Truthfully, it can wear on you, and I\u2019ve experienced my own level of frustration with zealots feeling their way is the only way, but it does work. I\u2019d say it\u2019s akin to [Daryl Davis](https://www.ted.com/talks/daryl_davis_why_i_as_a_black_man_attend_kkk_rallies?language=en), whom has helped get KKK members to leave the group simply by being an example of a good person and friend from a different background. Some people may be harder than others, but it has a high success rate if you\u2019re willing to do the work. But overall, I apologize if this comes off like a lecture after you\u2019ve expressed your frustrations. Those are totally valid and I\u2019ve been there. Keep doing your best and please know you aren\u2019t alone. If anything I\u2019ve said ends up being of help in the future, that\u2019s good enough for me.\n\nEdit: added link to Daryl Davis\u2019 Ted talk",

This is what makes it extremely difficult for black atheists to come out about their atheism.\n\nI just realized that I have a really narrow scope on how atheism is viewed by different cultures.",

We all curse/cuss now and then, but as you might have heard it said, \"you're the only bible some folks might read\" or \"the only Jesus some folks might see\", I implore you to regard best practices, remembering how the world perceives things, such as the way you comport yourself. It's important you stand out as a light and language - wholesome and grateful - is what flows like a watering stream in a dry and thirsty land. \n\nEphesians 4:29 \"Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.\"\n\nEphesians 5:4 \"Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving.\"\n\n1 Peter 2:12 \"Live such good lives among the pagans that, though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us.\"\n\nBut as the Psalmist prayed in the 139th, just let God search you and know you (and get back to you on it all). Be open to challenging yourself! You might find it fun to reflect at the end of a day or week, \"I said some pretty positive, God-reflective things that might have served to lead others to recognize that I am not of the world - that I stood out \"so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent, children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,\" (Philippians 2:15).",

Spreading the word in general is forbidden in a work situation and also frowned upon, part because most people, even if they havent taken an active stance on it, are not particularly religous to begin with.\n\nReligion is not a big thing here, it doesnt fill a void or take up a large space in peoples life here. People view it as none of their business, and couldnt care less in most cases. Im one of those that see the numbers of denominations and think; \"Which one was it again i was supposed to believe in?\" I have never really taken an active stance on it, but atheist is what i basically am and have no issue with it.

      "text": "Religions are considered a protected class, as violence against someone for their religion is or can be considered a hate crime.\nAtheism claims not to be a religion, thereby it isn't viewed as a protected class and many consider it to simply be a position of apathy.\nIf you are against religion, you are not an atheist, you are an antitheist and I believe that label fits many of you much better than simply atheist.\nAntitheism is an ideology with a particular political goal, the elimination or suppression of religion. Something that could be considered a hate crime against a protected class, if pursued through violent means.\nThis in turn makes people skeptical of you, if you pursue antitheism through non-violent means. Mainly because religious people may view it as an attack against their religion and thereby their person, while Atheists and religious people may view you as harboring more violent antitheistic tendencies beneath that layer of non-violent antitheism.\nSort of like when you tell a racist joke and some people assume you to hold deeper, realer racist sentiments.\nIt's not necessarily true, but people may perceive it that way and in turn view your verbal criticism as something deeper and meaner.\nAs a Catholic I respect your right to believe whatever you choose to believe and I accept that you do not want to believe as I do, but I believe myself to be correct and I know Catholicism to be correct. Thereby I will preach and proselytize and you are free to ignore me, walk away or argue with me. But ultimately you will never change my mind and I may never change yours, so it might be pointless to even start. But my religion commands me to proselytize, so I do. I'm sorry if that annoys you, but it will not stop me.",

Ppl really give a shit about it. But as I said like 4 times already. I never said there are other issues here, we just dont have the same as the ones op was pointing out.Also again, there is no law that criminalizes blasphemy if you would actually read them you would understand. The case you linked got 5 years on parole because he made an open letter in which he called the Quran a cooking book for terrorism and called ppl to use violence against muslims. This letter was send to TV stations and mosques. The mans criminal record included unallowed possession of explosives and arson btw. And yes, thats the same guy who wanted to sell those toilet paper rolls. He got convicted for the call for violence and the obvious reason why he send those letters specific to mosques. If he would have made a letter in which he explains why he believes in atheism and sent those to everyone in the city noone would give a damn.",

Such discriminatory laws have been addressed many times on completely valid grounds. The people in power typically decline to act under the pretense that the laws don't matter, which is the writ of erasure fallacy. The fact is all those laws, the laws against atheists holding office, mixed race marriage, black people voting, and homosexuals existing... all of those laws go immediately back into effect if the amendments or rulings that nullified them are reversed or reinterpreted. No legislative work necessary at the state level. \n\nAnd, in the mean time, they stand as a monument showing the views of the state toward persecuted minorities. \n\n>Do you really think that\u2019s a good example of how AZ hates donkeys?\n\nIf you've seen the relative sizes of donkeys and bathtubs, you have to understand that as a law protecting the welfare of the donkey.",

Just as asking a restaurant if they have meatless dishes is just a simple request like asking if they have any dishes that don't have tomatoes in them, sometimes asking to not be forced to attend religious worship practices (like prayers at a workplace or government meeting) is just asking for some consideration.\n\nIn other regions of the world, being an atheist is more like being homosexual, transgender, etc - it will get you killed.\n\nOne thing to recognize is that Christianity is founded in prosthelytizing - they believe it is their job to spread their religion and \"save\" others \"from themselves\".  (Yet of course they often tell you how Islam was spread by the sword while ig oring their religion's history of forced conversions.). Combine this with the above psychology and the sociological aspects of tribalism (creating groups of \"same\" versus the \"other\"), and this gives you the foundation to understand how they operate and why they act in hypocritical ways.\n\nAnnoying? Frustrating? Unfair?  Yup.  Is there a fix or a way to coexist?  If there is one, no one has found it yet. (Well,some societies do better than others, but even in these you have the outliers who reject civil discourse and empathy.)",

A religious person a) has it drummed into them that sharing the word is a good thing, and b) needs other people to agree with them to not feel doubt. I think that's why churches / temples etc are a thing - without seeing all the people that agree with you and reinforce each other, doubt creeps in.\n\nBy contrast, doubt or skepticism is inherent in every atheist (or most - there are people who treat it like a religion, and I think they are wrong to do so). Religion comes from other people - atheism often comes from within. So it's a more personal thing. I also think we know, as rational people, that we're not going to convince a religious person through proselytising - whereas a religious person sees proselytising as a positive even if it doesn't result in a conversion.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure that I want to convert anyone. I'm happy to express my own atheistic beliefs should people ask me, but in general the religious people I meet are not bigots, they're using religion to get through life, which is fine. If they have bigoted views, I will challenge them on their merit, not on their religious backing. If they bring religion into the argument, I'm done. Justifying bigotry with religion is just weak-minded cowardice shrouded in self-righteousness, and there's no changing the mind of a person like that.\n\nBut yeah. Ideally I wouldn't want to speak about atheism more, I'd want religious people to shut the fuck up at all times when in public.",

It's not the world I'm living in. In fact, here you are, criticising Christians, doing the very thing you think they're doing to you! \n\nThere has NEVER been a belief, or point of view, held by anyone, anywhere, ever, that has not had itself questioned, opposed, or persecuted by someone, and to suggest that athiesm is somehow special, or that it should be exempt from same critical questioning, is a strange notion in my opinion. I'm a Christian, and I'm a Christian who is a Christian despite the opposing views of athiests, and all other religions or belief systems.\nI have to endure criticism of Christianity. \n\nI have listened to criticism about my faith from opposers of it, and honestly asked myself if they have a point, or are speaking more truth than I currently know.\nThe criticism of others has actually strengthened my faith in Christianity.\n Truth is owned by nobody. The Truth stands alone as the Truth. We bend to accommodate it, not the other way around. \nWhen a man finds the Truth, he'll preach it, he'll live full of concern for others who don't have the Truth. \n\nIf you are not following the Truth, then it stands to reason that you are following lies. If you are convinced that atheism be the truth, go preach it, go convert the whole world. Go make it your mission In life to enlighten the decieved. Do it if it costs you your life. \n\nYou said that it infuriates you that Christians are free to openly express their beliefs. Wow. What a strong statement. If I was in your shoes, and really thought that atheism was the truth, I'd preach it with conviction from the rooftops and it wouldn't matter if they stoned me to death for it, I'd be dying for truth's sake. Fury wouldn't be the emotion dominating me for sure. \n\nI want to humbly suggest that your fury comes from something deeper, that you had to take to reddit to express your fury says a lot. Silencing what you don't like is not a good tactic to navigate life, and won't make you well rounded as a person.\nIf the freedom of speech/expression you're looking for as an atheist doesn't make room for those that oppose it, you must realize that you are not actually looking for freedom of speech/expression at all. You don't really believe in freedom of speech/expression. You only want to dominate a conversation and silence your opposers/contradictory thinking on the matter. \n\nYou say that Christians ostracize atheists in your community. Really? They have ostracized you? What are they doing, beheading infidels and unbelievers??? Are you really wanting me to believe that, having read your post and understood your fury at Christians, that  you would actually be comfortable in a Christian community as an atheist? The fact is, that you don't like Christianity. That is what will ostracise you. We gravitate towards like minded people in life. \n\nI am sorry if my response to your post seems harsh, or strong. I hope I haven't offended you. I just think it's very serious when we want to silence our opposers. Your post is really strong, and I felt it warranted a strong response. \n\nI wish you well.",

Life is very rarely how we want it to be and sometimes we have to suck it up and accept the shitness for a while. It might not be ideal but it could be worth thinking longer term and deciding if what you're going through is worth the financial support? I don't know where you are or the employment prospects that you have so I don't want you to make rash decisions based on the advice of people who don't fully understand what you're going through.\n\nI was kicked out at 15 and made my own way in the world and I'd never have it any other way but I'll be honest with you, it wasn't easy. I ended up homeless for a few months and nearly made the ultimate decision on multiple occasions. On the flip side I travelled the world off my own back for 5 years, have  my dream job and an amazing partner who supports me through thick and thin.\n\nLife is very rarely easy but that doesn't take away from you as a person. Be strong in whatever choices you make and know that there are people out there who will support you and believe in you. You're worth it and you will succeed beyond your own expectations. Overall, be true to you. \u2764\ufe0f",

In that, he thinks it's a phase where I'm \"figuring myself out\" bc of past trauma. And my mom? Oh my fucking god. She would ACTUALLY disown me if she knew I was an atheist. She already thinks she's \"failed\" me as a mother bc I'm pro-choice. If she knew I was also an atheist\u2026 oh boy. It annoys me though because I could literally save the world, but if she knew I was an atheist? I would be a disappointment to her. A failure. A lost soul. I feel awful constantly lying to her about praying at night and everything, and I know that she loves a version of me who is not me. That hurts a lot, bc I know that she will never love me for who I truly am, and that I will never be enough because of my personal beliefs.",

It just creates very bad blood. I just always politely declined church, nodded my head when they would talk about God this and that, and ignore all the Jesus quotes.\n\nI have a great relationship with most of my family at this point. They do their thing, and I do mine.\n\nIf they continue to shove if down your throat to a point you can't really handle it, you can always move. I joined the military at 20 which helped, but college or anything like is always a possibility.",

OP put it in his post, that religious people get to openly talk about religion all the time. he's gonna hear about religion no matter what, it's just so prevalent.\n\nwhy not say that exact statement, but backwards to a lot of christians? they need to hear it more than anyone.\n\nyou're kind of proving OP's point here, religious people get to talk religion all the time, but then an atheist can't talk about their atheism without getting some negative reaction.",

That's been my experience with atheists, the only atheists I've met that don't really do that would self-identify as agnostic. The Christians that I surround myself are the opposite of offensive when evangelizing. We don't put people down for sin (we're all sinners).\n\nIn short, it looks like most atheists who go out and advocate for their (lack of) belief, see a small section of extreme/unbiblical Christians. They then prepare themselves to argue with them in a proportionally aggressive way. As a result, a lot of good people feel targeted and attacked in a hurtful way. I'm sure that happens in the inverse too but I've lived in very Christian areas, and very non-theistic areas of the US and this seems to hold up to me anecdotally.",

      "text": "What era/time are you living in?\n\nA) Christians in MANY parts of the world are murdered, arrested and tortured for even noting that they have become a follower of Christ. Even in some more western (liberal?) countries, they will be arrested or shut down for stating, not hate speech, but that they do not subscribe to the redefinition of marriage or refuse to call their 10-year-old son who's now a girl by the right pronoun. Christian freedom? That, sir, is geographical.\n\nB) Atheists stand up for what's NOT believed, but don't feel compelled to evangelize generally, as they feel that everyone not intelligent as they are are simpletons and that they are 'not worth their effort' ... hmmm, confirmation bias works both sides of the fence, doesn't it?\n\nC) Are you 'black African' or 'black American'? There's a difference. If you were in Africa, Christianity is not very free, as there is a significant amount of militant Islamic folks there oppressing anything non-muslim. If you are 'black American', then you're probably in a bible belt somewhere where there are variations of extremist Christianity that is very 'controlling' in character. That said, you have THE FREEDOM to shout aloud \"I'm an atheist\" and though it results in your being ostracized by some, you are still free. When Christians announce they are not Muslim, they lose everything - far more than you every thing you would or are doing so.\n\nD) Christians are called to 'share their faith' when asked for the hope they have that makes them different in spirit (Peter's 1st letter, Chap. 3/vs. 15-16), to work quietly/mindfully while ignoring other people's business (Paul's letter to the church in Thessalonica Chap. 4/vs. 11-12)  , but not to judge those outside the faith (Paul's letter to the Corinthian church, Chap.5/vs.12).\n\nNot all are called to be vociferous faith-sharers - some do it quietly, by example, as suggested/referenced above. Maybe that's rare where you're from, but that was the way initially.\n\nI'm sorry that the strong, committed faith of others makes you feel uncomfortable. But right now, everyone - even in the west - who dare say they are a bible-believing Christian is not lauded in most places, but despised, called a hater and risks losing their job if they deign to 'share their faith'.\n\nDude, you sound like you were born in 1950's bible belt! Get out ... see (and know) the world and realize how privileged you are to declare, with (in my opinion, misplaced) confidence  'I am an Atheist'. And then, just for kicks and giggles, sit down with the bible - read through the New Testament in full - the Gospels and the Letters - so you can better assess the false Christians around you from the real ones.\n\nThe real ones? You'd love them ... because they'd love you right! Hope you find a few.\n\nLove to you sir in the Name of Christ my Lord :-)",

If you bring this analogy to most of them, most of them will back off and understand that not everyone thinks the same way as them.  \n\n\nI use to joke with the Mormons who believe that only 144,000 people will be saved so when one would ask me to become one I'm like \"well there are 2.6 million Mormons in the world... you giving me your spot?\" but honestly most people make religion their whole identity and way of life because of their past, their parents were religious and their parents before them... its a more of a tradition than a belief at this point.  they look for something in common to bond and share trust and form their own circle.  It's why there is such a thing as a \"black\" community, but as I said it's most times weaponized and used to control... just like Religion is. If everyone would stop being society minded and start to think of themselves more as individuals in a society then things like religion would lose their power to control people.",

In our faith those who don\u2019t believe and love God go to hell, and most don\u2019t want people to go to hell so we try to bring them to faith in the Lord. Jesus literally told us to spread his word so that others can come to believe in him. Correct me if I am wrong but as far as I know atheist are not told or required or even slightly encouraged to convince others of atheism. Our reason is so that others can love God and not go to hell. An atheist doesn\u2019t have a good reason as they have no one to serve.",
