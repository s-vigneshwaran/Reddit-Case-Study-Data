Modern Christians claim to believe in many things, often including (bit not limited to) concepts like salvation, repentance and forgiveness of sins, punishment of sinners, sacrament, faith expressed as works, the ten commandments, some variation of the Holy Trinity or an abstraction thereof, and yes, Satan.\n\nBut you'll also see many Christian groups preach [Prosperity Gospel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology) which is anathema to the actual teachings of Christ, who deplored such pursuit and accumulation of wealth.",

All in order to promote a hateful and discriminatory mindset that allows for the easy shepherding of multiple individuals towards one goal. This is because they know it\u2019s so easy for most to join together in their mutual hatred of those that don\u2019t fit into the cookie cutter mold of an \u201cideal Christian family\u201d. I know not all Christian organizations are so forward with the way they achieve this goal- or even in their direct ambition to do so. But with that being said, I firmly believe that the world would be a better and more hospitable place without large organized religion running rampant in government. As well as allowing Christianity to dictate the way people carry out (or are able to carry out) their day to day lives in the current political and social climate presented to us via the religious extremest that claim safe haven from behind a cross. As they desperately try to inflate peoples sense of authority over others in the name of \u201csalvation\u201d in order to spread their message and sphere of influence.",

He was like a wild cow mooing for its young in the wild grass, its scorpion-infested cow-pen. The Tigris ...... at his side like a rampant bull. By lifting his penis, he brought a bridal gift.

It brought barley, mottled barley indeed: the people will eat it. It filled the E-kur, the house of Enlil, with all sorts of things. Enlil was delighted with Enki, and Nibru was glad.

One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.\n* People are fallible.

My wife and I raised her atheist.\n\nThe question basically was \"How do you know?\"\n\nI said I didn't know but I pulled out an atlas of the world and said point to a spot.\n\nI then explained the religion that arose from that spot. Covered Christian, Mohawk, Hinduism, Aborigine Spirit Belief, Japanese Ancestor beliefs, Confucianism and such. We looked up a bunch since I didn't know them all.\n\nI told her every place on earth where people settled they made up a whole new religion in each spot and that their were thousands of religions that exist and probably 100s of thousands of religions that were dead and gone.\n\nThe one thing they all had in common was that they came from the only animal on Earth who had all evolved to tell stories, to have fantasy and adventures and often to take those stories and add on to them make them even more fantastic to even change their own history and make it more fanciful.\n\nThe reason people believed in them was because it helped them understand the world, often wrongly and it allowed them to have something that everyone wanted, to live forever and to be special.\n\nHeaven, Valhalla, Elysian Fields, Reincarnation and such allowed us to get around the idea of life being a temporary gift that would come and go and let people hold onto the idea that they could always keep that gift and that their friends and family weren't actually gone but just somewhere else and it's nice and it's comforting and feels good to feel special that something will take care of you but believing in stories doesn't make stories true but you can still feel special because there is something that will take care of you, the friends and family that you have and will have and you know they're real because they helped us put the couch that were sitting on in this house. \n\nI find the best educational resource, is to make them aware of as much as possible. I would get other questions but in grade 7 several years later she did a project about her beliefs and they were atheist and I was happy because her friends and schoolmates listened and never criticized or attacked her for them even though there are Christians, Hindu and Muslim classmates. They were all respectful (this in Canada so it tends to be a bit more secular in some places).",

Kid shows at planetariums. Children's museums. Cartoons/book series like Magic School Bus are always a classic too! Hope this helps!

Instead you can talk about the cosmic teapot and the dragon in your garage...it's asking them to prove that you don't and then tell them that's what their god is.\n\nMine?  My proudest moment was when, as a 4 y/o, we were doing halloween and stopped at a church event to get some candy.  My kid was coloring and an old church lady was looming and running on about jesus...my demon spawn finally stopped, looked at her, and asked \"who's Jesus?\"...gal almost had a heart attack.\n\nYou make fun of it.  You ridicule it.  Kids recognize that stuff easily.  Zombie Jesus is a common theme in my household when god comes up.  \n\nTell them straight up that it's not real, and is just a crazy story like the fantasy and sci-fi on the television.  They know Godzilla isn't real, just make sure to tell them that the religion stories are just as bad.  Tell them people made it up to control others and that it's sad when someone you know is lost to it.\n\nIt can be dangerous to ridicule Islam in some places...but fuck those people.\n\nUse [this list](https://thetruthsource.org/list-of-world-religions/) to show them how many people think the same thing about *their* god.\n\nAlso, show them that you're not unreasonable.  Take them to every single church and synagogue and mosque in the area...do road trips and buy ice cream and then after attending mass or w/e ask them what makes this group different from the rest?  Pick it apart and make it fun.  They'll love spending time with you and everyone loves ice cream.\n\nStuff like that.  It's the real world stuff where you actually talk to your kids that matters.  If they read get them [some Hitchens](https://www.amazon.com/God-Not-Great-Religion-Everything-ebook/dp/B00287KD4Q/ref=sr_1_1?crid=QFYQR9ZAN16L&keywords=hitchens&qid=1655937216&s=books&sprefix=%2Cstripbooks%2C1372&sr=1-1) and/or read it with them.

It might be better if you post a primary source that actually has pertinent facts, but of course that wouldn't look good for your assertion. The defamation lawsuit based out of Seattle (The United Federation of Churches, LLC v. Johnson et al.) is probably what you're referencing. That doesn't seem like a SPAPP lawsuit at all. Legal proceedings are expensive, but that doesn't make it an illegal SLAPP case.\n\nIt's clear you have an axe to grind and ignore other cases like Satanic Temple et al v. Scottsdale, AZ or Cave et al. v Thurston. You've also conveniently ignored (again) the larger ramifications in 23 states once Casey/Roe is repealed. Yes, one doesn't need to belong to TST to fight these suits (the Florida abottion case is with a Synagogue) but TST fills gaps when the other abrahamic religions don't step up. But frankly, no religion should be inserted into these political and legal issues, hence the need for orga like TST",

I also have my suspicions that the biblical scholar professor was an atheist.

She worked tirelessly badgering the Board for 2 years to change the HOA rules so she could have her \u201cfreedom of religion.\u201d By the time other residents saw the new legal covenants it was too late.

The Puritans soon followed, for the same reason. Ever since these religious dissidents arrived at their shining \u201ccity upon a hill,\u201d as their governor John Winthrop called it, millions from around the world have done the same, coming to an America where they found a welcome melting pot in which everyone was free to practice his or her own faith.\n\n>The problem is that this tidy narrative is an American myth. The real story of religion in America\u2019s past is an often awkward, frequently embarrassing and occasionally bloody tale that most civics books and high-school texts either paper over or shunt to the side. And much of the recent conversation about America\u2019s ideal of religious freedom has paid lip service to this comforting tableau.\n\n>From the earliest arrival of Europeans on America\u2019s shores, religion has often been a cudgel, used to discriminate, suppress and even kill the foreign, the \u201cheretic\u201d and the \u201cunbeliever\u201d\u2014including the \u201cheathen\u201d natives already here. Moreover, while it is true that the vast majority of early-generation Americans were Christian, the pitched battles between various Protestant sects and, more explosively, between Protestants and Catholics, present an unavoidable contradiction to the widely held notion that America is a \u201cChristian nation.\u201d\n\n>The much-ballyhooed arrival of the Pilgrims and Puritans in New England in the early 1600s was indeed a response to persecution that these religious dissenters had experienced in England. **But the Puritan fathers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony did not countenance tolerance of opposing religious views. Their \u201ccity upon a hill\u201d was a theocracy that brooked no dissent, religious or political.**\n\n>The most famous dissidents within the Puritan community, Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson, were banished following disagreements over theology and policy. From Puritan Boston\u2019s earliest days, Catholics (\u201cPapists\u201d) were anathema and were banned from the colonies, along with other non-Puritans. **Four Quakers were hanged in Boston between 1659 and 1661 for persistently returning to the city to stand up for their beliefs.**\n\nThe Puritans couldn't have their desired community of religious exclusion in England, so they came to the Americas to banish or murder those who practiced other faiths (or were indigenous). \n\nThat's the America that many still desire.",

I have friends who are vicars/priests in the CofE. To be honest, it's a really mixed bag. It's an institution that has a long and complex history...so with that comes good stuff and bad stuff. I would say that socialogically and politically it has mild-moderate influence, but it tends to to tow the line culturally (see it as safe and relatively mainstream). \n\nE.g. I have a friend who is a vicar and 3 days a week he works at pub selling drinks and chatting to local people in his community and then the other 2 days he works in a community centre running a \"church\" that consists of addicts and other \"outcasts\". This is all funded by the Church of England, recognising the deep need in the community for hope and a listening ear. At the same time I have another friend who is effectively a 5 day a week priest in one of those old-school buildings. So it's broad and diverse. Nationally, the CofE seems to be a bit fluffy and follows whatever the prevailing culture is. \n\nSorry for the long reply but I hope it helps...",

                                  "text": "Yeah that actually helps a lot! The churches here in the US are kind of a mix of what you described, some of them (the *vast* majority of which being the small local churches, with only a few hundred members) do a lot of help in the community, things like food drives, but in my experience it\u2019s with the expectation that the people being helped are being exposed to the \u2018word of Jesus\u2019 or however they frame it. \n\nThe straight up corrupt ones are mostly the huge mega-churches, with tens of thousands of members, where the pastor has his own tv show and owns a bunch of yachts and stuff. They *say* they do a lot of the things the smaller churches do, but from what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a lot more cult-like with the hidden purpose of funneling tithe money to the guy at the top. Of course you do have some of the smaller churches, like that one super homophobic church in Florida (can\u2019t remember the name), that are basically just a cult, but they aren\u2019t the majority by any means.\n\nAs far as my experience with Southern Baptism, I actually can\u2019t say all that much about it specifically. Like I said in another comment, I wasn\u2019t raised religiously and almost never went to church. My grandparents are *suuuuper* Southern Baptist and took me to their church a couple times when I visited them as a kid, but it was one of those normal local churches. I was like 7, so all I remember was the youth stuff they had me do like reading some bible passages and stuff, and being super awkward cause I was from out of state and didn\u2019t know anyone. \n\nWhenever my grandparents visited us we were expected to pray at dinner, but that\u2019s the only time we ever did, my parents aren\u2019t openly religious at all. My grandparents go to a local church here occasionally when they visit, and try to get us to go with them sometimes. As a kid, every birthday or Christmas gift came with a bible of some form and the cards all had bible passages. But that\u2019s about all I\u2019ve experienced directly with religion. I never really cared for the sermons, I thought they were super boring and even as a kid I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around why I should believe a dusty old book they say was written by a sky wizard. My grandparents never pushed any of the awful homophobic or racist stuff that a lot of people here do, they only ever talked about how Jesus said to do the right thing and be kind and stuff. My parents taught me that outside religion, so I never needed religion to tell me how to behave. I don\u2019t have any ill will towards anyone who does the whole religion thing (except for the racism and homophobia stuff, there\u2019s no excuse for that), but it was never directly a big part of my life. Even though I didn\u2019t participate, I was just surrounded by it in soooo many smaller aspects. \n\nMy parents made sure to keep me away from all the batshit crazy people growing up, so none of my friends were ever really into religion either, although some did actively go to church. Now that I\u2019m in college I have met a *lot* of people who are just as crazy as the internet says. It kind of shocked me the first time I heard someone being just straight up racist with a religious reasoning, because I\u2019d always been sheltered from that stuff and taught that it was wrong, I assumed that it was all just overblown on the internet and that *surely* nobody actually behaved like that. I had been taught that religion was just about being kind to everyone, and I ignored it because I was taught that outside of church. Hearing someone using what I had been told was good to justify something awful was really eye opening to how varied religion is in the US.\n\nMy experience with Southern Baptism directly was *very* tangential, but religion is so baked into the culture of the South that I was exposed religion quite a bit anyways. Couple things I forgot to add to my original comment that also serve as examples: when I was in the interview to get my Eagle Scout rank in the Boy Scouts, one of the questions was along the lines of \u2018do you believe in a religion\u2019. They can\u2019t say god directly because of legal stuff, but it was *very* heavily implied. They couldn\u2019t fail you for not believing in a religion, but if you said no they would find a reason to fail you. At 17 I had already decided I was Atheist (haven\u2019t let my grandparents know yet so don\u2019t tell them lol) and so I just lied and said yes. The other example is that as a kid o was told to pretty much keep quiet about the fact that we didn\u2019t go to church, not because of safety or anything but because there was a high likelihood that we would be invited that Sunday, or we would be given a bible, or would be asked a bunch of stupid and personal questions about why we didn\u2019t go to church. That\u2019s the other thing about Southern Baptism, they were *very* eager to recruit people and to get people to come to their church. Not for money like the mega churches, but because a core part of the belief is that they have to get as many people as possible to follow the word of Jesus. \n\nThat got a lot longer than I expected lol. Hopefully I did a good job explaining my experience. I think I have a somewhat uncommon view on religion in the south since I didn\u2019t actively believe or participate in it, yet as a straight white dude everyone around me assumed that I did.",

Muslims in America don't ask other people not to eat pork; you can keep your ideas about abortion to yourself (or at least admit that it's a personal opinion, not a divine mandate).\n2. Don't complain about people's beef with your religion.  If you (not talking about you specifically) aren't part of the problem, you should know damn well that there *is* a problem.  And there're only two ways out of it:  the whole religion fades into cultural irrelevance or people within the religion shout down the crazies and toss out the profiteers.  If you aren't down with the former or willing to contribute to the latter, you can just take your lumps along with the rest.",

It's the religion's *influence* that needs to fade, not its existence.  I don't have a problem with Muslims in the US because the Muslim faith doesn't really have any sway in the US, politically or culturally.  I don't have to consider what Buddhists may think of what I say or do.  I'm not worried that a group of loud mouthed Wiccans might lobby to have books removed from the local schools.  These are all concerns I have to take into account when I interact with Christians in the US.  In other countries, the balance will obviously vary.\n\n>I'll also add that if someone (infrequently) is spouting some crazy shit at our (small/medium sized) church I will take the opportunity to destroy them because they usually have no idea how the world works now.\n\nThat's what's needed, but not just in the church.  Anywhere you are, if you call yourself a Christian, you have a responsibility to call out those acting in bad faith around you.  If I see a group of people, and one makes a racist comment to no opposition within the group, I'm looking at a group of racists.  ACAB exists because no cops oppose those who actively harm.  Misogyny lives on because it is normalized and tolerated within social groups.  The same issues and perceptions hold true of religion.\n\nSound potentially stressful and mentally exhausting?  You bet.  It's also about the closest thing you could do to actually following Jesus, since a large part of what he did was calling people out on their bullshit (also pretty much why he was killed).  Christians benefit greatly by being associated with what is considered the social norm in the US.  Frankly, pretending that there's no social responsibility that comes with that is Boomer shit.",

It's clear that the majority of people who attend church lack critical reasoning skills and do not think for themselves, but it's even more diluded to think any politician is making decisions based on the bible or for religious reasons. They use religion as their tool to get voters support because, well as I said, the genre of people do not think for themselves. Perhaps may be less in intelligent overall? Who's to say. I've heard them vocalize valid interpretations idk. As with most things it's probably a spectrum and not black and white.

I think it's fair to say that most people who are pagans (of which there are numerous types and flavors) have some personified central focus for devotion -- i.e., a deity or deities, even if they are regarded as largely symbolic. I for example am an animist, I find the divine most easily in nature.\n\nAtheists profess to specifically not believe in any deity or god or whatever. They may be otherwise vague about any spiritual aspects of themselves, but the last thing I would call them is pagans.\n\nAn argument could be made that heathen or heretic describes their non-belief system, but those words are part of the whole Christian/organized religion dogma that they're rejecting in the first place. \"Atheist\" literally means no god so it's both neutral and accurate.",

It is ultimately the acceptance that there is some sort of absolute which makes the world make sense, but that it lies somewhere beyond human capacity to understand. That is the entire reason that believers decided upon an evidence based analysis of the available facts as the appropriate way to seek further understanding of God's world.\n\nNow specific church doctrine, and the insistence that one must believe certain things without understanding anything, has been abused by those in positions of power. I won't deny that at all, and I've been digging on that specific subject for a while now. Do not confuse the corruption of an organization created and maintained by humans with the philosophical ideal that there is an absolute law somewhere out there which makes the world make sense, for it is that ideal in which believers place their faith, not the priests who claim God's authority as their own.\n\nWe can see today that those who hold power are once again attempting to claim sole authority over the scientific method, to reduce it from an avenue for earnest inquiry into yet another vehicle to demand absolute obedience without even understanding the subject.",

It is why I joined the organization- and using the term \"Satanic\" does all the heavy lifting for us. The organization knows the law, the Constitution, and we know what we are up against. By using one word, we show it may not matter if the law is actually on our side at all- that a judge will simply turn away from applying justice because of the use of that word. \n\nInequality and injustice is not new and continues to be a struggle. I cannot imagine how much harder it would be for me if I were a different skin color, a different sex or gender, or came from a different country. All of these people should fear the system. If they will turn away from a group using a word that offends people so much, imagine if they think you are a lesser person because you are brown.",

I wish more Christians would speak up and demand better of their churches, demand better of whatever sect they belong to. The thing is, they seem to get alienated instead if they speak up too much or in the wrong way. My parents are currently looking for a church community. They are ex-Catholic but still Christian. My uncle is pushing them towards Baptist churches because that is what he believes. I'm trying to guide them to check out the local Unitarian Universalist church because my parents are more genuinely progressive, accepting/welcoming/caring/giving, curious about the world around them and aren't the type to alienate others. Being Baptist doesn't fit who they are as people or their personal values. \n\n\nSo I am curious how \"progressive\" your church is - do they believe in separation of church and state? How inclusive are they? What actions do they take to be sure they aren't waving political flags? Are you allowed to speak the opinions you shared here without fear of being pushed out? I mean these questions with genuine curiosity so I hope they don't come off as accusatory in tone.",

We'd often have a scotch and talk faith and fiction. I miss him quite dearly.\n\nBut, I'm an Episcopalian. My priest best described the main tenant as \"caring about the creeds and everything else is just fluff\". My congregation is aggressively liberal in its acceptance of others, regardless of sexuality/gender/faith/income/housing/anything. Our concern is to serve the community and try to spread salvation by showing God's kindness and love, and if people want to know why we do what we do, *then* we can start talking about scripture.\n\nBut yeah, the opinions I spoke previously are common among the people I consider part of my \"church family\".

She was raised in a Polish-Catholic family, in that deep tradition. She also has her PhD in genetics from the U of I. She *also* is the director of a STEM outreach center and has focused her career on helping under represented children gain an interest in science and know there are future careers for them there. She does important work that benefits everyone. \n\nHer sister is also catholic and is a board-certified educator focusing on advocacy for underprivileged ESL youth. Her work also is making our world a better place. Her children have the concept of \u201ckindness above all things\u201d drilled into them. They\u2019re good kids. I\u2019m The godfather of their eldest, and I\u2019m very proud of her. She wants to be a scientist when she grows up. \n\nFinally, I had an atheist coworker who is, to this day, a massively intelligent and cunning person, as well as a self-centered and cruel-hearted man. He has a son who has learned from him that you can get away with a *lot* of things if you simply don\u2019t care about the feelings of others. This has *nothing* to do with his lack of a faith; he\u2019s just smarter than most of the people he surrounds himself with and cares nothing for them or their happiness. I could tell you stories. He\u2019s honestly worrisome, considering he\u2019s a trump supporter and loves to show off his handgun at parties. \n\nI want you to keep all of this in mind and examine your biases against the theistic. A person\u2019s faith does not dictate their ability to contribute to society in a positive way, nor does it indicate how they might raise their children. It certainly will be *a* factor, but it is absolutely not *the* factor for everyone.",

There's nothing in the Talmud that explicitly says, as far as I know, that induced abortions are allowed for mental health reasons, although most Conservative and Reform Jews and many Orthodox Rabbis would support an abortion as allowable under evidence of extreme harm to a mother's mental health as determined by a psychiatrist or other medical doctor. But ultimately, Jews make up about 2% of the population, so in a democracy, they're not going to have an big influence on legislation in a lot of areas. \n\nNative Americans are a completely different case as they're semi-sovereign nations with their own membership requirements. They often have treaties with the US government equivalent to those with foreign nations. You cannot extrapolate from what tribal citizens can do on tribal lands and apply that to US citizens in territories controlled by the sovereign authority of the state or federal governments.",

That doesn\u2019t mean walking into your neighbors house and raping / murdering them was legal in those societies.\n\nAs someone else said, the first religions were small tribal religions largely consisting of animism, the revering of nature. And religion in and of itself is an extension of the nature of the humans who envisioned it. The reason *those people* set rules forbidding stuff like murder is because they realized it was wrong, even without having anything to base it on. This is because by our very nature humans are social, empathetic creatures and the good of the group is equitable to the good of the individual. A tribe of 300 hunter-gatherers likely isn\u2019t going last very long if one of the individuals in it goes around murdering the others whenever they feel like it.\n\nAnyways my point is religious rules are extensions of human nature, because religion is itself an artifact of human nature, and the more common rules people created in religions do not require religions to exist, because again, they already exist in our nature.\n\nThis is why multiple different religions from geographically isolated parts of the world share similar rules (such as don\u2019t murder people) all developed independently of one another. The notion of not murdering people is more fundamental than the religions that incorporate it.",

This is yet another example of your arguing in bad faith.\n\nThe regulations on other states, for instance, those that would ban -all- abortion, clearly do not seek to protect the fetus. Especially as they would allow prosecution against a woman aborting a stillborn, ectopic, or other nonviable pregnancies.\n\nNote as well that there is general medical consensus on viability, and many of these state laws do not rely on this consensus. If the health and we'll being of the fetus was the primary purpose of these regulations, surely they would seek the expertise of the medical community, no?\n\nAnd to your last paragraph: a majority of Americans support access to abortion. In fact, Missouri, whose law may end Roe, had split support for access to abortion. Note as well that your \"for the people, by the people\" argument offers no interest to the large numbers of citizens who support abortion access, even in states that may have a majority who oppose it.\n\nBeyond that, if a state argues that a fetus is a person, and codifies that position, they are saying that a fetus is a person, legally.

Or worse you turn into \"I am a classical liberal\" type and start voting for the GOP.\n\nThen you come back and complain that the GOP are trashing everything and whine that the dems are ineffective.\n\nHonestly, while I am not a liberal, I think most Americans would be extremely happy with Biden and the dems if Joe Biden and the DNC platform had 60+ votes and passed their stated legislation. The reality though is that they just don't have the numbers anywhere close to do so.\n\nAnd it isn't a plot by the DNC to just not pass anything.

Either way, I'm not sure how to phrase this and I'm not sure if anyone will see it.\n\nHave any evangelical groups publicly, successfully or not,  that things like abortion, trans rights, gay marriage, etc. should be illegal because they find these things offensive to their religious beliefs? I know individuals/organizations have fought against having to be directly involved with things that deem \"sinful.\" Companies have been able to opt out of providing certain Healthcare benefits to women, for example. I'm sure there are legal challenges in the works to allow open discrimination against LGBTQIA+ individuals as well. All in the name of religious freedom. All these scenarios of people using religion to control others, to interfere in things that don't concern them?\n\nSo, what's to stop someone from saying their religious beliefs are being challenged, by laws that limit access to abortion? That they feel their faith is violated by anti-trans legislation. \n\nWho exactly decides if a religious belief, let alone the religion itself, is valid? I could essentially create my own religion that explicitly states that all people deserve equal rights. Equal pay. Access to Healthcare, education, housing, etc. I could argue that my god commands us to provide even the basic essentials for all living beings, a fair chance at making something of themselves, and basic human respect. I could take the government to court for violating my religious freedom, right? \n\nIs the ownus on me to prove my religion is legitimate? How can I ? How can anyone prove anything about their religion? Do more recently created faiths, like mormonism, get the same protection as christians? Why not the same protection for Satanism or Pastafarians? Will the courts have to ultimately ask for proof of any god's existence in order to confirm any violation of faith has actually occurred? There doesn't seem to be much clarity on who wrote all of the bible and the church doesn't like to provide much in terms of tangible evidence. \n\nReligion is so stupid.",

Like you wrote, you cannot just argue that a law violates your religious beliefs and have it overturned. If you could, then I could argue that my religion required animal sacrifice or child sacrifice and get murder laws and public health codes overturned. The Supreme Court has established a narrow set of circumstances where you can get a law overturned because it violates your religious beliefs. Laws that generally apply to everyone equally  (like abortion laws), serve a legitimate public/governmental interest, and aren't intended to suppress a particular groups' free practice of their religion usually cannot violate  the first amendment. \n\nAs for proving your religion \"legitimate\", you generally don't have to. You just have to claim that you have a sincerely-held religious belief. The other party has to prove otherwise, which is usually difficult. That's why the \"Church of Satan\" is able to be seen as a legitimate religious group, because it's very difficult to prove in court  they don't sincerely hold those beliefs, even though they obviously do not.",

The courts voted to overturn it 30 years ago, but Justice Kennedy changed his mind at the last minute, not because he thought that *Roe v.

You can\u2019t lump them all into the \u201cbigot\u201d category  just as you educated me that the Satanic Tenple doesn\u2019t actually believe in Christ, just because something is one way doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the other.\n\n\nYour problem with expectancy into society is largely based on the naming sense, if your teachings in fact do not reflect on that.",

The government has a much higher standard of showing a compelling state interest to uphold such a law than it does when it passes a law that simply limits how a person can act in a way that might violate their religious belief, like say, murder laws preventing a satanist from practicing human sacrifice or health codes keeping a Wiccan from keeping and sacrificing goats within city limits. \n\nSo even assuming that satanists practice abortion as part of some sincerely held satanic ritual, because the state has a compelling interest in defining the circumstances under which abortion is legal or fetal murder, et cetera and because it's not actively forcing someone to commit an act that violates their religious beliefs, it has an extremely high burden to overcome if you want to claim the law violates the first amendment.",

That study also shows 35% support for abortion without restrictions. 13% support outlawing abortion entirely, which is exactly what conservative politicians bave always pushed for. The pro-choice side of the issue has been consistently polling higher for [more than 30 years](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/13/about-six-in-ten-americans-say-abortion-should-be-legal-in-all-or-most-cases-2/). First/early second trimester excluding medical necessity or other extenuating circumstances has been a pretty standard position for  pretty much all of that time, and in all of that time the Right has been lying their asses off about every part of the issue, just as you did here. Pretending that the data falls in a nebulous position somewhere between outlawing abortion and killing newborns with hammers, and that both groups split the pool evenly, is totally a page from the Republican playbook.

My politics and that of the Temple align in pretty much every way, as I said in my first comment, and I support them in donations and also talk about them publicly to friends, as I also said in my first comment. Don\u2019t understand if you missed that or chose to\nignore it.\n\nThe Temple is also clearly political, as I\u2019ve also been saying in almost every comment on this post. Literally nowhere did I claim otherwise. \n\nI\u2019m starting to be concerned you\u2019re just not reading my comments in full, and making snap reactions based on a few skimmed words of context rather than the whole thing.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m hopping a plane so I won\u2019t be able to respond for a couple hours. I will say though that I\u2019m not sure why this conversation has such an adversarial tone towards me when I support the organization and politics and just don\u2019t think the name\u2019s as helpful. I\u2019m not attacking the org or saying it\u2019s dumb. Just voicing my opinion.",

      "text": "I don't think should surprise anyone for a few reasons...\n\nFirst, it's no secret that there are countless religious people in positions of power in the courts, legislative bodies, and in society as a whole. In the U.S. they are largely Christian, meaning that if no further research is done, and/or if faith is followed, the Satanic Temple represents evil.\n\nSecond, while there are growing numbers of secular people around the world, including in the U.S., most of them are quiet about their beliefs. I personally don't like people being in my face about their *insert religion here,* so I avoid sharing my personal beliefs unless I am having a discussion regarding it. I think there are many secular, non-practicing, or atheist/agnostic people that honestly just want to live their lives, and see the Satanic Temple as an organization that might be about the separation of powers, but ultimately is just another movement that is making use of pro-religion laws to push their agenda.\n\nLastly, and to kind of tie into both previous points, I think the Satanic Temple comes off to many people as childish and in your face. While some might say that it is operating in the same manner as other religions, I would say that it isn't serious in it's mission, and does a disservice to the secularist movement as a whole.\n\nNow I want to be clear; I am not against them pushing the envelope, using \"freedom of religion\" clauses to point out hypocrisy, or lobbying for the separation of church and state. I support these things, but the Satanic Temple, or more specifically their members, looks like an edgy Hot Topic meetup crossed with some sort of new aged wisdom convention. It is a mixture of \"genuine Satanists,\" the socially downtrodden and rejected, and some people that are using it as a means to push their agenda, and while of course we are more likely to see the weirdest members and practices in the media, it doesn't change the fact that from the outside looking in, the movement is just weird.\n\nUltimately, I think my opinion can sort of be summarized by a 2013 clip from The Newsroom about the Occupy Wall Street Movement... [\"is there any chance it's because you're not (taking it seriously)?\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwk_Ot8orPY&t=39s)",

In practice, this means that it is totally up to the individual judges on cases to decide whether or not something is a religion. I'm not really sure this is an indication that the legal system is corrupted... but rather, that the legal definition(s) of religion, all the way up to the constitution itself, is arbitrary and inherently at risk of being at the whim of judicial bias. I'm honestly not sure if it's even possible to have a workable objective standard. I would go so far as to say that the law itself is incomplete and broken, but aside from removing any and all laws dealing with religion, I'm not sure there's any way to fix this.",

If we simply look at the name of something and make assumptions or make it harder for them to have fair trials simply because of the label that they identify with. It's even worse when you actually look at the teachings of this church and find out that they're much more humane and progressive than Islam Christianity or Judaism. So it is a failing of our judiciary system if they are simply looking at it solely on The name of the church goes by.",

The long answer is a tad more complicated \n\n> There is a long tradition of courts competently scrutinizing asserted religious beliefs for sincerity without delving into their validity or verity. The difference is this: Suppose someone claims a religious objection to eating broccoli, but that same person knowingly eats broccoli each week. A court, without asking whether there is any moral truth behind a religious objection to broccoli consumption, may nonetheless ask whether the claimant actually holds that religious belief. The former, spiritual question is one no court should ever ask. The latter, factual inquiry into fraud is something courts are well equipped to do by examining objective criteria\n\nhttps://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/questioning-sincerity-the-role-of-the-courts-after-hobby-lobby/\n\nhttps://www.law.uw.edu/wlr/print-edition/print-edition/vol-92/3/adjudicating-religious-sincerity",

Spiritualistic religions wouldn't exist otherwise. \n\n> it is estabilished\n\nYes, so is TST. Registered as a church with the IRS and all. Seems pretty established to me.\n\n> satanism isnt actually the worship of satan\n\nYes it is, but we're not talking about satanism. The satanic temple are the ones who don't believe in Satan, and they don't need to, to be considered a religion.\n\nI don't know why people feel the need to start adding qualifications to be a religion. How about we treat people equally and get rid out theocratic laws that serve no purpose anymore. Then TST will probably go away on it's own.",

He's correct that the ADF is no doubt worried that they will use the same arguments, and the ADF does in fact want to prevent that (being Christian fundamentalists). And the ADF certainly has hopes and plans about how it will happen. And the author supposes what might hypothetically happen if the TST were to advance certain arguments. But he doesn't actually mention a specific case where this was born out, does he?\n\nIf you examine the ACTUAL cases that have managed to make it in front of courts, you find substantive differences. For instance, the case where the TST lost because what they claimed the law required wasn't actually what the law required (ultrasounds, pamphlets, etc). Basically, somewhat simple mistakes on the part of the TST that made the whole claim moot.\n\nThe author may end up being correct at some point in the future. But he's not correct yet.",

We all know that.  People don't show up for services, there isn't a preacher trying to decide \"what sermon should I give this week\", and people aren't worshiping god.\n\nIt's not a church, it's just a bunch of trolls who intentionally picked a name that will piss people off.

Evidence that the woman used its magic required.  Please tell me the locals didn\u2019t have a sham \u201ctrial\u201d and execute the woman.  \n\nIt\u2019s crazy to think a god would allow a being with more power then it to roam the earth.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but you saying things happened via evil magic creatures should have as much weight as me saying the creator of the universe told me that all Muslims need to pay me 20 dollars a year, or they can\u2019t reach paradise.

Evidence he was a prophet, and evidence he said anything that is in the quran or the hadith. As it was a recitation that wasn\u2019t written down for many years I don\u2019t see how you can prove he said any of it.  And there is little of any note in the recitation that wasn\u2019t already known or suspected at the time.  Meaning the scientific claims rely on very loosely interpreting passages.  \n\n> That\u2019s enough proof for me\n\nUnfortunately too many people feel the same.  \n\n> He would have to be a mathematical genius to find the exact proportion of water to land on earth.

Make sure the verse quoted isn\u2019t overruled by any later versions.  I do think that\u2019s genius, solves any contradictions between in the book instantly.  Odd that a perfect book would require that.\n\nEdit:  Holy shit!  I looked up the claims, it\u2019s all apologetic bullshit.  Don\u2019t bring up Stephen hawking and Hawking radiation.  That has not been demonstrated yet.  It is still a hypothesis.  And yes scientists use the term \u201cpuncture\u201d but it doesn\u2019t quite mean what apologists try to frame it as.  In fact information may be destroyed by a black hole, so don\u2019t go there. \n\nBut go for the rest, especially the land/sea thing.  As long as you don\u2019t count all the times the words are said it\u2019s 71%, but sometimes it\u2019s higher.  And sometimes lower.  If only god had just said an actual number.  \n\nAnd no, dna and the rest are not mentioned. \n\nWeird.  But send it anyways.  I can hopefully help at least one person on the brink see the forest of bullshit and save them.",

Because hundreds of years ago after a terrible war it was decided to get all the recitations written down, pick the \u201cright ones\u201d and destroy all the other versions.  Leaving zero evidence as to what may actually have been said in the past.  \n\n> As for the \"If they do evil its gods fault\" thing. It actually isn\u2019t, freedom of will is beautiful, isn\u2019t it? Now if the angels do something evil yes it would be gods fault because he didn\u2019t program them to do evil things.\n\nWho made these evil jinn?  If god did, they are his fault.\n\n> Quran was spoken from the prophet Muhammad(pbh) mouth, High angel Gabriel would come down with chapters from god and would repeat them to Muhammad\n\nProve it.  Don\u2019t say what you believe, demonstrate it\u2019s true.  \n\n> scientists have proven that around the time of the prophet muhhamed (pbh) lifetime the moon was split in half and then put back together\n\nNothing else will be posted after this unless you post peer reviewed scientific evidence of this claim.  Not an apologist page saying it happened.\n\nA peer reviewed scientific study showing the moon was split in two, and put back together when your alleged prophet was alive.  \n\nPost it or admit it is a lie.\n\nOr go away.",

But even after that just because there is no research on the matter doesn\u2019t mean it never happened. \n\nYou lied.  By doing so you demonstrate exactly why your religion is evil.\n\n> There\u2019s a verse in the Quran that talks about god sending down iron and that that metal was never part of earth. Scientist found out as of recently that iron was never part of earth and that it came from stars\n\nThe same ones that demonstrated the moon was split?  Please provide peer reviewed material that states the earth never formed with metals.  Because I\u2019d love to hear that the earth was metal free until meteors brought it all.  \n\n> Again, freedom of will the right to choose good or evil.\n\nAgain, if god created them, and they are evil.  He was responsible for it.  If he created them knowing they would have so much power, and being all knowing knew they would become evil.  He is responsible for all the evil they do.  Did jinn turn evil?  Or did god make them that way?\n\n>  I just wanted you to understand that we aren\u2019t a religion like Christianity, Hinduism, Confucianism Judaism whatever.\n\nLies.  Apologetics for the perfect word of god.  Not having anything to meet the burden of proof.  Seems pretty similar to me.\n\nDid the lady from your first story get executed?  You never said. \n\n> Have a great day, if Islam seems to hostile to you, I\u2019m sorry, the satanic media and shadow government doesn\u2019t like us at all.\n\nWhy would I think a religion that wants me dead seems hostile?\n\n> Also I noticed you never disputed my claims on the land to sea ratio\n\nYou said the book said it.  It doesn\u2019t.  If you count the number of times a certain word is used it comes close if you don\u2019t include them all.  \n\nI noticed you never demonstrated how you know something that was written well after the death of its \u201cauthor\u201d is actually the words of the author.\n\nI noticed how you never demonstrated a god exists.\n\nI noticed how you never demonstrated the quran is the word or work of god.\n\nAnd I noticed how each time you deflected to another wild, unsupported claim when asked.",

The entire purpose was to try and show the hypocrisy of religious freedom. Good for them - still not a religion with real religious tenets, and the existence of a \"sincere religious belief\" is at the heart of the religious freedom analysis undertaken by Courts under the 1st amendment. \n\nSo, for example, if your sincere religious belief is an \"abortion ritual\" that didn't exist until Roe was threatened, a reasonable Judge would obviously infer it's not a sincere belief. So that's why when they file lawsuits asserting a right to defend a belief they made up after some issue was raised just to file a lawsuit, Courts determine they aren't sincere... because they're not actually a religion. It's not rocket science. An actual Satanist religion would win if they had a sincere religious belief in abortion that, say, had a history and text to back it up that doesn't suggest it is merely a reaction to a law.",
