Corona virus vaccines have been in development since 2001 but joe has repeated pushed forth the notion that this vaccine is brand new, there is nothing else like it, the spike protein is the boogie man and changes your dna. Why are his listeners so certain of all that shit too with no actual proof? I think it\u2019s really fun to believe that you have the secret evil knowledge that big pharma is coming to get us all but you \u2018dodged the bullet\u2019 by not getting vaccinated.

You say my words are vulgar, I honestly think your existence is vulgar. Please give what Joe Rogan says a real hard think and maybe do a google search before you latch onto his great truth. He is not a smart man and he doesn\u2019t even do his viewers the service of reading what more educated people write. He is just a person who reads headlines then turns that headline into a talking point. The classic \u201cdidnt even read the article\u201d with the added facet of having millions of listeners.

Isn't that the shallowest/ most meaningless insult you can say about someone who disagrees with you?\n\nFact: Joe Rogan has been either flatly incorrect or toeing the line of incorrect/misinformation this entire time.

An anonymous internet user is asking how much I, another anonymous internet user, weigh? \n\nWhat in the holy fuck do you plan to learn from that? \n\nSecondly, every time I've responded answering your questions, you've moved the goal posts. Now you're trying to win an argument about Joe Rogan's covid bullshit by asserting that I'm overweight and want to take the easy way out? \n\nThis is why Rogan fans have a bad rep and why I tacitly called you an insecure male. You're losing an argument and shifted to working out instead of dealing with the argument at hand. That is desperate. Combined with the fact that you write like a drunk crossword puzzle, I'm inclined to think I have nothing to gain from continuing this conversation. \n\nBut because I'm pretty proud of this, I'll bite: I ran 186km in October. It was fun and I did it without listening to your whoa boy Joe.",

It was suggested that aspiration might be a good method to ensure you weren't hitting a vessel. \n\nPretty sure that was just a suggestion and never acted on as an actual SOP, though.\n\nEDIT: Found an okay [summary ](https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/incorrect-vaccine-administration-is-a-potential-cause-of-post-vaccine-adverse-effects-but-more-research-is-still-needed-to-confirm-or-reject-this-hypothesis/) of this whole thing, if anyone wants a quick read.",

I was an IV drug user for years so IVs and blood draws are stressful and can be difficult. They did well inserting an IV in my left arm and used that for the transfusions I needed and the blood draws. \n\nMaybe after time, the IV stopped working well for drawing blood from as about 36 hours into my stay, a nurse had a hard time getting blood from it. She got it, but somehow it was \"no good\" because another nurse came in to get it from my right arm, and I protested- \"can't you use the IV?\" He said no, and I proceeded to tell him about my IV drug use and that a lot of my veins were scarred pretty bad in my forearm...\n\nHe was the coolest, most badass dude ever. He was an older black guy, maybe 50 or so. He cuts me off with \"I got you, man\" Probably due to my foul mood from being there, and no sleep, stress, etc. I took his statement as if he was brushing me off. He proceeded to do the blood draw in like 15 seconds total. I said \"That was amazing. I can't even tell you how in awe I am right now\" He replied, \"I told you I got you!\" It was literally the most memorable moment of my stay.\n\nHe was amazing. I don't think he was in my room for 60 seconds. Like a thief in the night.\n\nEdit: I thought I was replying to a user who had mentioned a phlebotomist and I was going to say that I wonder if this guy was a phlebotomist. So I replied to a different post and forgot to mention the thing that spurred my reply...pretty smooth on my part.",

Where does the timing expectation (5 days) come from? To be honest, 5 days doesn't make much more sense to me than 2 days...

It doesn't prove anything about accidental administration, which would basically never be the entire volume of a vaccine, let alone many many times the dose of a vaccine, regardless of what animal it's in. It then goes on to say something irrelevant about aspiration which was not the subject of their study at all. They need to stick to their lane in terms of what they've actually demonstrated rather than making a leap to propose something that they've produced no evidence for (accidental IV administration is possible, can cause myocarditis, and can be prevented by aspiration). It's fine that small studies are where stuff starts. But this is something that *people are coming into my clinic asking about and wanting practice to change*. Based on a few mice. Maybe the antivaxxers would have seized on it either way. But that misleading conclusion doesn't help.",

There's more text based anecdotal reports like these. Feeling metallic taste so early hints that the vaccine may have hit bloodstream, but there hasn't been any scientific investigation into that. It's hard to say whether aspiration in these people's cases would have avoided Myocarditis. One is Kyle the mountain biker and the other is YouTube user named Booki, if anyone is interested in the experience. Of course it's very rare to happen, so it's not something you should generally worry about when getting the vaccine, but the question still stays, why did they feel metallic taste and would aspiration have helped them?",

The doses were totally unreasonable (.25mcg per gram of mouse, about 5mcg per mouse, which since humans get 30mcg per dose is like a human getting nearly 600 doses of the vaccine, all IV). And even if you were trying *really hard* it would be basically impossible to inject all .3ml of the vaccine into a vein. They're piddly little veins in the deltoid, *which is why it's a good injection site*. It's a dumb theory.",

If you're trying to inject into the bloodstream, you'd normally aspirate (as best practice), to ensure your needle is in the right place.",

Outside of dorsogluteal area, where it could cause issues still. If you're doing an intramuscular injection it's not a negative to aspirate, it's just not needed. I doubt the UK sees a reason to retrain their nurses. It's a needless but not dangerous technique for many injections. In certain situations it's still recommended, but not with steroid injections. Also, I have a feeling they may just recommend aspiration because it's not dangerous and is still required for other types of injections.\n\nAnd no one in the states does recommend it anymore. Why should I care what they recommend in canada or the UK? I don't live there and it's been shown to be not needed.",

And I know what US government suggests about vaccine injection, but to be fair the guidelines in Finnish health care are that you should always visually observe if blood is flowing in to syringe and aspiration is not mandatory but can be done if person injecting wants to be sure. And even if \"risk\" is stated to be \"minimal\", it's still there and literally there is no reason to not aspirate and make sure that there is no openly cut blood veins directly in the area of muscle where the medicine is injected.",

We were taught the first month of Nursing school how to do an injection.  Please at least read the end of my message  I shortened the link for you  :\n\n[https://www.drugs.com/cg/how-to-give-an-intramuscular-injection.html](https://www.drugs.com/cg/how-to-give-an-intramuscular-injection.html)\n\nHow do I give an intramuscular injection?\n\nPrepare the needle: Hold the syringe with your writing hand and pull the cover off with your other hand. Place the syringe between your thumb and first finger. Let the barrel of the syringe rest on your second finger.Hold the skin around where you will give the injection: With your free hand, gently press on and pull the skin so that it is slightly tight.Insert the needle into the muscle: Hold the syringe barrel tightly and use your wrist to inject the needle through the skin and into the muscle at a 90 degree angle.Check the needle: Let go of the skin with your other hand. Hold the syringe so it stays pointed straight in.\n\n***Pull back on the plunger a little to make sure you did not hit a blood vessel.***\n\n***If blood comes back, remove the needle immediately. Do not inject the medicine.***\n\nPush down on the plunger to inject the medicine. Do not force the medicine by pushing hard. Some medicines hurt. You can inject the medicine slowly to reduce the pain.Remove the needle: Once the medicine is injected, remove the needle at the same angle as it went in. Place gauze over the area where you gave the injection.\n\nAll I said was that an IM shot should always be aspirated before administration. I have given probably a thousand in my career. I'm presently overseas vaccinating people for COVID as we speak.  For once I saw someone misrepresenting the truth and gave my experience and knowledge.  This has become so tribal. I was almost laughing at my karma dropping by the hour for just making a statement you can research on any website.  \n\nBut I dont believe any of the issues regarding non aspiration. Any first year nursing student would not make that mistake.  If there are that many issues from non inspiration then I wonder who is being tasked with giving these injections? I think it's a non issue and we are chasing a false narrative, but I am not wrong, IM injections are always aspirated unless you want ot inadvertanly cause someone harm\n\nThank you for your nice response.

It\u2019s only in areas where it is highly vascular such as near nerves etc.  Perhaps 26 years ago, first month of nursing school you were but since modern medicine and evidence based practice tells us that it is no longer needed.  Old habits break hard.  I know some nurses in countries who state that gloves aren\u2019t necessary when giving injections or when handling patient care unless you are going to be in contact with bodily fluids.  But of course, IM injections in deltoid whether you aspirate or not, must be given accurately by feeling for the acromion process and 2-3 finger breaths below it.   As you know, we as nurses are required to continuously update our knowledge every time we renew our license.  At least it is required in our state of California.  I suggest that you remain updated on evidence based practice especially when following CDC guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/general-recs/administration.html) as aspiration with any medication can cause pain to the younger population (i.e infants).   Thank you.\n\nP.S When giving IM injections it\u2019s always best to follow company policy or CDC guidelines when giving the vaccines as it is the best source of information than drugs.com - highly reputable when it comes to medication but not really a main source when it comes to your company\u2019s requirements when giving IM injections.",

And since the covid vaccinations are being done by so many different people, asking them all to introduce aspiration into the process would carry way more risk that they fuck that up. there is also something about it being difficult with the needle gauge they use, but I'm no expert. \n\nThe entire right wing griftosphere has been quoting this article over and over.",

We have contracted rates with insurance companies for different types of plans and regardless of what we charge we\u2019ll always get paid that amount. Usually some multiple of the Medicare rate. If you don\u2019t have insurance at most non-profit institutions you\u2019ll get a steep discount from the listed price, ours is 50%. Even after that you can still get additional discounts based on your income. Prices really only go up so that CFOs can gaslight everyone into believing there\u2019s revenue growth and the execs can get raises, which is pretty shit.\n\nInsurance companies on the other hand have most of the power when negotiating rates. Tack on tons of administrative burden that cost provides tons of money which in turn costs everyone money.

It\u2019s neither a free market nor government controlled. Prices are set by AMA which is a private organization. Specifically, the committee called Relative Scale Update Committee... or RUC. Medicare physician fees are set based on recommendations by RUC. Insurance companies base their prices on Medicare pricing... which historically has had 87% of its prices set by RUC (the private organization). The healthcare industry, specifically RUC and AMA are part of the private sector. They see subsidized prices and see green. But specifically, they see prices subsidized by private insurance as their money maker. After all, private insurers pay nearly double (199%) what Medicare pays for all Hospital services. So yeah, neither government controlled nor a free market. It\u2019s something different.",

Then, insurance often limits who an individual can get care from, so choice is further restricted. If you don\u2019t have insurance, you have the option of paying an arm and a leg or declare bankruptcy. This isn\u2019t even the least of it, considering how government has only aided in helping insurance companies and medical care facilities get every last cent from people.

Because they are not trained (and because the syringes are not really made to be easily aspirated) the chance of trauma due to attempted aspiration outweighs the benefits.\n\nThe study does mention that there are exceptions, local anesthetics being 1, that should be aspirated because the potential side effects of those medications getting into your blood stream outweigh the potential trauma caused by someone who isn't a pro with a syringe/needle. \n\ncould covid vax end up being on of these situations? maybe.

The study is inconclusive, it's not trash or whatever some people seem to point at. Study being inconclusive doesn't negate any of my arguments or questions though.\n\nDo you agree that:\n\n1. Myocarditis can happen as a result of the current vaccines.\n2. Vaccines can cause metallic taste within 15 seconds of the injection.\n\nIf you agree with this, I need to show that, people who got Myocarditis were much more likely to feel metallic taste compared to people who did not get Myocarditis.\n\nThis could hint that there's at least some connection between these conditions.\n\nIf there is, that is useful information because we can.\n\n1. Pay extra care for the heart if the person injected feels metallic taste. Prepare for it better.\n2.

That means a brief withdrawal of syringe plunger to exclude blood aspiration to ensure that the needle is not accidentally located in a vein before the injection is given.\u201d\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab707/6353927",

Instead of making sure blood is pulled back, as is the case with an IV injection (like you said), the purpose was to make sure no blood is pulled back, indicating that you are not in a blood vessel.\n\nAspiration during an intramuscular injection is no longer recommended. So I really think this is an issue of someone not being aware of updated recommendations/guidelines. This happens a lot, because recommended healthcare practices are always changing. Another good example is Basic Life Support. Because BLS recommendations change so much, some people administer breaths during CPR, some don\u2019t. Some compress faster than others. And everyone was doing it correctly *at some point in time*.",

There's no concrete proof or scientific evidence, but I do think it's something that needs to be figured out, why are so many getting metallic taste, by which reasons and why so many of those end up with Myocarditis? On the other hand many others are saying that even if there was aspiration it would do practically nothing to save it from going to bloodstream, if even it was possible it went to bloodstream. And even if it went to bloodstream it would have no effect. Anyway, I don't know which side is right here, but I would like some investigation and debate into it, because if this is a real issue then this could save many from Myocarditis.",

At any rate, I attended nursing school in 2011 and, at that time, we were still taught to aspirate. I almost never see anyone doing it now in practice though I did when I practiced  because it was how I was taught, but I left the field several years ago. \nHere\u2019s an accepted manuscript of someone responding to the research: \nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab741/6359059",

The overall inflammation is greater with the 2nd dose, and the problem with the mRNA getting into heart cells is a part of that overall inflammation, so overall symptoms and complications are higher. There is another confounding variable of age. Older people (>50) experience a much weaker inflammation reaction than young people, so even if mRNA gets into the heart cells it's less likely to cause problems.\n\nGiven that 1/3000 people aren't suddenly getting life-altering injury from the vaccine (the chance of problems are way lower than that), it seems likely that an accidental intravenous injection isn't guaranteed to cause side effects, but is still a risk factor for myocarditis. Or maybe there is a spectrum of outcomes that would be revealed by a full cardiac checkup of a representative sample.\n\nThere have been anti-vaxxers trying to claim that the increased probability of rare complications after the 2nd dose is due to some sort of \"cumulative toxicity\". But this doesn't make any sense with the accidental intravenous injection hypothesis &mdash; that would be a 1/3000 event followed by another 1/3000 event, which is around a 1 in 10 million chance, which is then further reduced by whatever probability it is that intravenous injection actually causes injury.",

This is an acceptable risk for some things, but possibly not for an mRNA vaccine where the [mRNA strands can travel to the heart and nervous system in mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34406358/) and cause lasting damage. Many other IM injections are still aspirated in recognition of the risk of hitting a vein, I'm not sure why the facts on this suddenly changed when numerous nurses and doctors have confirmed that there is still an aspiration policy for many IM injections. Antibiotics and fat-soluble steroids are particularly high risk.\n\nDoes this mean you shouldn't get the vaccine? No &mdash; the risk is extremely minimal, and less than 2000 cases of myocarditis have been confirmed out of hundreds of millions of vaccinations in the US.\n\nBut this thread is full of misinformation and skips out on the actual important research on this by painting it as just a Joe Rogan musing.",

It doesn't hurt to aspirate it, but there is no benefit -- So it's not like someone needed to run around and tell every nurse in the country to stop aspirating before injection, it's just a thing we used to teach.\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/blog-post/mrna-vaccines-what-happens\n\n> Because the MRNA is supposed to stay in the muscle, & you don't want it circulating to the rest of the body. \n\n***This is just factually incorrect.*** Some of the mRNA will remain at the injection site, the vast majority of it ends up in the liver within the first minutes to hours, some will be picked up by the lymphatic system as well. What remains at the injection site will continue to be \"active\" (If I put a luminescent trace in your vaccine and tested for the trace later it would still be detectable) for about 7-10 days. \n\nThere is NO DANGER of (AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS POINT ENOUGH) \"[COVID-19 vaccines] circulating in the rest of the body.\"",

I remember listening to him literally arguing with Tyson about gravity, Rogan was trying to be all deep and ask why gravity exists, and Tyson was basically saying \"it exists because it exists and we can see its effects.\" Rogan kept pressing the question, Tyson kept dismissing the question basically saying \"we don't need to know why we know, we just know.\" Rogans ego would not let it go, it was sad and so stupid.\nThat was pretty much when I stopped listening to him.\n\nNow fast forward and he's spouting misinformation and people gobbling it up like Thanksgiving dinner. \n\nI'd like to quote George Carlin \n\"Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that\"\nThe average American has gotten more and more stupid, and it seems the lower the iq, the higher the number of offspring. And the kids pick up all of the wonderful qualities their parents picked up. Btw I'm not saying you're stupid if you have kids or a lot of kids, there are some smart parents out there too. I'm just saying I don't see scientists and engineers pumping out kids at the same rate I see warehouse workers and truck drivers. I'm saying that reason and common sense are OUTNUMBERED in this country.\n\nAnyways as an average American I interact with other average Americans and this has been my observation. \n\nI honestly don't know if there's hope for this country",

Since the pandemic he's turned into an absolute shit show. \n\nI don't know what happened to half of our country, Trump put some kind of spell on them that I just don't understand. If I go back 10 or 20 years the thought of any president behaving the way he did or saying the things he did seems ludicrous and the whole country would have been calling for his resignation. Jesus, Bush certainly wasn't great but when I go back and listen to his speeches it's like listening to Shakespear compared to a Trump speech.\n\nIt's not just stupid people either. My parents are fervent Trump supporters. They don't have his flags up and stuff (as far as I know, they moved recently) but I know they voted for him over Biden, not that Biden is any real treat. They are not stupid people, and they raised me to be a caring and kind person. I cant for the life of me understand how they got duped by his bullshit.

The downside to mRNA vaccine in the bloodstream is apparently myopericarditis. \n\nNurses and health professionals explicitly refusing to aspirate, and saying they know better, is gross. All I'm asking you to do is take 3 seconds to make sure you haven't hit a blood vessel of any kind. That's it! I don't care if it's \"extremely unlikely,\" so is dying of Covid outside of vulnerable groups. Since when do we *not* apply rigorous procedure to medical science? Why are people so defensive over simple things like \"please aspirate my needle so that my heart doesn't blow up, I hope I don't need a medical degree to request that.\"",

White, black, Spanish. And as far as McInnes goes, he has NOTHING to do with the group now, or when Trump mentioned them.

Sure he doesn't care about masks really or vaccines for himself but it's not like he's saying hey don't wear a mask fight back and shit I think he just doesn't trust the goverment considering theyv done so much sketchy shit in the past testing diseases on their own people and other people.",

Where one is the holyiest and the other is the evil dragon. I feel like theirs just so much political pressure being placed on people making everyone disown eachother but it's almost like the goverment put these puzzle pieces together to start all this political divide. Dr fauci confusing the media getting things wrong as well but people come to his side on the left. The right being retarded when it comes to conspiracy theories so everything they say just comes off as stupid but they actually have some merit to what their saying. We can't genuinely look at the secret Cia or whatever tf files that got leaked about dropping the flu virus on people in San Francisco. Testing ghonera and syphilis on prison inmates or immigrants and shit. So when these right wingers are kinda all huddled together i get why their worrying. The left doesn't act like they get why their freaking out. I mean I got the vaccine cuz I ain't no bitch but their is valid reasons to worry about a different medical technology that's brand new. I mean I would also argue that u should Def worry about covid. I think it's a mixture of problems and people reacting with anger and frustration and I just don't get it, now everyone hates eachother it makes no sense. We got the right complaining about masks and shit which I get if u have a physicaly intensive job that gets hot. Shits uncomfortable but then we have the left who's like shut it all down no matter what and it's like everyone is just following so hard with political masses that I feel like we don't pick or choose logical beliefs cuz it might be associated with a political party they oppose. It's all such a predicament. It's like the dems say trending news shit to get our attention like yah their doing good shit but at the same time I feel like the serious problems aren't changing. Rent, hospital, school, all cost to much. Shit if I could go home and not worry about the price of everything then it's like aight whatever this political shit don't matter but at the end of the day what is anyone doing for us?",

I said that the first political party in opposition to the vaccine were the democrats. This is objectively true. VP Harris said she would not take the vaccine if recommended by the Trump admin. And Biden told people not to take the vaccine right before early p1 phases. They absolutely caused thousands of deaths with their opinions that were not backed by scientific data. So many people could have gotten the vaccine under Trump. Its really a shame democrats didn't take the pandemic seriously, and even incentivized the spread of the disease with BLM protests. Apparently making their voices heard was worth killing thousands of people.\n\nWe're going to look back in 10 years and probably openly shame Democrats for their response to the pandemic in more ways than one.  \n\n\n>Yall are amazing.\n\nNot a Republican. Independent liberal.",

Which would you choose to obtain? Obviously, you\u2019d choose the chair. That\u2019s because there are many types of chair, produced by scores of different companies and widely distributed. You could buy a $15 folding chair or a $1,000 antique without the slightest difficulty. By contrast, to obtain an X-ray you\u2019d have to work with your insurance company, wait for an appointment, and then haggle over price. Why? Because the medical market is far more regulated \u2014 thanks to the widespread perception that health care is a \u201cright\u201d \u2014 than the chair market.*\n\n\n*Does that sound soulless? True soullessness is depriving people of the choices they require because you\u2019re more interested in patting yourself on the back by inventing rights than by incentivizing the creation of goods and services. In health care, we could use a lot less virtue signaling and a lot less government. Or we could just read Senator Sanders\u2019s tweets while we wait in line for a government-sponsored surgery \u2014 dying, presumably, in a decrepit chair.*\n\n\n -Ben Shapiro\n\n\n*****\n\n^(I'm a bot.

In light of that, I might get downvoted to hell, but I did actually request that the person giving me my second injection aspirate the needle. As far as I'm aware none of the right wing nut jobs were talking about it at the time. \n\nIn actuality there *is* some evidence that nurses should be aspirating the needle, as accidental IV injection has been linked to a greater risk of complications in the mouse model by a reputable study published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. [Source (abstract)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34406358/)\n\nWhere Joe Rogan is an incorrect idiot is that it absolutely isn't the established procedure. This study was published in August (a month before the president got his booster, which is what I'm assuming he's referring to here.) Further research is likely needed, and there are some low risks involved with needle aspiration as well. It was recommended by the study, but that doesn't mean that it's reasonable to expect them to be aspirating the needle on the president a month later, nor is it an established medical practice for vaccines in general. To say that not aspirating the needle before injection is straight up wrong, or that the nurse was somehow not following procedure is ridiculous. Needle aspiration may prove to be worth the risk as a standard practice for the Covid vaccine if further studies support it. Hopefully these nut jobs didn't poison the well on the subject so much that those studies can't get funded.",

There are data that show that aspiration is more painful for the vaccine recipient. IM injections are not given in areas where large vessels are present. Given the size of the needle and the angle at which you inject the vaccine, it is difficult to cannulate a vessel without rupturing it and even more difficult to actually deliver the vaccine intravenously. We are aware of no reports of a vaccine being administered intravenously and causing harm in the absence of aspiration.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SOURCE:** [**https://www.immunize.org/askexperts/administering-vaccines.asp**](https://www.immunize.org/askexperts/administering-vaccines.asp)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: In case you claim the source is bs and is misleading or something.

No other vaccine in the history of VAERS went from 0 people vaccinated to over 200 M with at least one dose in <12 months.

And, that you refuse to acknowledge the causal relationship between trumped up concerns over a vaccine and people making false reports ;)\n\nNo, obviously it must be a conspiracy by the global elites including conservatives and demoncrats to convince everyone to get vaccinated so........we can become magnetic, 5G spying on us, Hubble telescope,  spike proteins, etc.\n\n> Authoritarianism \n\nGod forbid the experts ever be wrong.

In THIS thread alone, you used him making a claim about the vaccine timeline - which was updated thanks to operation Warpspeed - to argue against the vaccine being safe, yet now you'll admit that you don't think he's credible and that he is a human capable of being wrong???

But some of us believe that government and corporate corruption exists. I think that's the thing we disagree about.\n\nI actually fully agree that the government and major corporations are extremely corrupt. I support the most progressive candidates because they're the ones who actually seem interested in addressing that. It doesn't surprise me that you're making the connection between me thinking the vaccines are safe (based on science) and me somehow not  believing in corporatate/governmental corruption. \n\n'5.

It's rare to meet an American whose life was untouched by it.\n\nConcurrently, our for-profit medical system is ass backwards.  Doctors and nurses have been overworked and understaffed since forever and it's led to about 450,000 deaths due to medical error.  For context, that's slightly higher than everyone in the US that died \"while confirmed to have or was presumed to have Covid at their time of death\".\n\nAnd in the face of this ongoing problem and in the middle of a deadly pandemic, last year's \"heroes\" are getting fired, laid off, and forced to resign by the tens of thousands.  That doesn't say 'healthcare crisis' to me.\n\n> Im saying to respect the collective input from your experts.\n\nAnd I'm saying that last year the collective opinion of the experts was that rushing a vaccine was dangerous and insane.\n\nLast year, ivermectin was distributed *to almost a billion humans* and this year it's horse dewormer.  Did you know that the way Emergency Authorization works is if there's a viable treatment for a disease, the EA for the vaccine would be rescinded?  \n\nDefinitely has nothing to do with Fauci taking one of the few studies that looked at HCQ-alone as a treatment rather than one of the vast majority of studies that look at HCQ+Zinc which show it works.  That's just bad luck.\n\nPfizer & Moderna & J&J are set to make a hundred billion dollars next year for their booster shots.  It's hard to trust people with that much financial incentive.",

Advocates of aspiration contend that it is a technically easy maneuver that is rapidly performed and well tolerated by patients with no increase in costs incurred. However, due to a paucity of available data, there is no evidence that this procedure is essential or truly beneficial. This issue has been widely debated with specific regard to vaccination; there are no studies that have assessed the need for aspiration prior to IM injection of vaccines in relation to vaccine safety.",

Systemic adverse effects profile and mode of delivery (IV vs IM and SC) of drugs plays a significant role in the decision to aspirate or not to aspirate. There is ample evidence that suggests that aspiration may not be required for IM and SC injections, while for IV injections the systemic side effects of the drug should be considered when aspirating before any injection.'\n\nThis is what your link says. It contradicts Rogan's claim. What's your point?",

First she disnr trust it bc the fda didn't approve it, it was made too fast, it causes infertility (she has her tubes tied and she's 45, so idk why that matters to her anyway), it is a mass execution, it has tracking devices in it, it's the mark of the beast, and now she says \"I am not getting the vaccine bc someone has to be around to take care of your kids WHEN you and your husband die in 2 years\" and I straight up told her that I do not want someone with her views and morality to be anywhere near my children. We stopped calling her as much recently and now she's saying shes \"been thinking about getting the vaccine\" but she is just trying to manipulate me like always and I don't think she's thinking about it at all. Or anything for that matter. Her dr even told her he recommends her to get it and she still hasn't. Just really screams \"smart\" to me hahahhh",

IM (intermuscular) injections or subcutaneous (top most layer of skin - you have 3 layers) dont have enough blood to aspirate. Aspirating by the way is drawing a small amount of fluid (usually blood) back into the syringe to confirm placement. When giving a vaccine, typically it is an IM, we dont want blood. By injecting into muscle or fat tissue it will slow the absorption, which is a good thing in this case. So if you see a nurse aspirating, they are probably old school, giving a special drug, or did something wrong.",

While the findings of some studies support the hypothesis that accidental intravenous vaccine administration caused these effects, these results were obtained in small-scale animal studies and aren\u2019t definitive. Further research is required before accepting or rejecting this hypothesis. - CDC\n\nIt's already a very tenuous call to make. What's obvious is that conservative media is continuing to use any and all uncertainty to confuse and mislead the public on vaccine safety and efficacy. \n\nIntramuscular vaccinations have been performed for many decades before Covid without aspiration. The safety of these procedures was confirmed using sonography decades ago. As others have said there is no need for aspiration anyway given that the injection sites lack any large blood vessels.",

But when you're mass injecting a billion people, you're going to be hitting a couple of blood vessels all the same. Either through dumb luck, or because some people are weird and have extra vessels. Or maybe because not everyone who is administering these vaccines world wide has the same skill. \n\nTrue, the odds remain small. But maybe you hit one vessel per 10k injections. And maybe 1% of those unfortunates is unfortunate enough to have some kind of reaction to the vaccine in their blood stream instead of IM, and voila, you can end up with extremely rare side effects.\n\nIs this conclusive? Of course not. But aspirating costs you nothing, it takes less than a second, and maybe it's a tiny bit more uncomfortable for patients. But when you're vaccinating a billion people, erring on the side of caution might not be the worst thing in the world.",

Aspirating needles is common practice and has probably happened in nearly all other vaccines you have received - but because the vaccine was administered by many many different types of people (i.e. dentists, firemen, pharmacy assistance, etc) the recommendation was not to aspirate as they believed it would be an undue burden to educate, and does slow down distribution slightly.\n\nIt's bullshit that they didn't vaccinate the president because of that - they did. And they probably vaccinated millions while hitting a vein. If you had a bloody injection site you most likely had your shot administered into a vein. From what we know now it only sometimes causes side effects, but we'll probably learn more as time goes by.\n\nSo yes - aspirating would've probably decreased side effects, no it does not mean the president wasn't actually vaccinated.",

      "text": "I work medical, what part and where is none of your business, and there is a reason to aspirate the syringe.\n\nFirst off let's define aspiration when dealing with med administration, and not the kind where shit goes into your lungs. Aspiration in this scenario is talking about when you go to inject a med into someones muscle or fatty tissue you are suppose to pull pack on the syringe. If you give the shot in the muscle its called intramuscular (IM) and in the fat subcutaneous (Sc). The effects of each desired insertion site defer from the meds given, how they absorb, desired effects etc. Believe it or not, different meds delivered at different doses in different locations of your body can have completely different results. A lot of the time if not most of the time the different effects are either non existent or negligible in my experience.\n\nThe reason you aspirate when giving a med IM or SC is to see if you are in the muscle or the fatty tissue. If you draw back blood you are in a vein or artery which isn't the desired route of administration. What affects this can have if given intravenously (IV) or in the artery depends on the dose and the med. \n\nA good drug people like to reference in this situation, and that currently is a topic of debate, is the administration of phenergan. Phenergan use to be given intravenously (IV) like it was no big deal. Then studies found that it was causing burning sensations during IV administration and was causing damage to the patient's veins. Now they suggest giving it intramuscular (IM), or severely diluting it if given IV. In fact a lot of phenergan vials are starting to say for IM use only on them. The take away from this? Stuff changes all the time in the medical field. What was good 2 years ago is no a direct contraindication. Even though the med is given potentially in two different routes, its desired effects are the same. There however is a potentially added undesired effect.\n\nNow I'm not going to claim that I'm an expert on the pharmacokinetics of every single drug with every single dose and every single route. I understand the ones I've been trained on pertaining to my specialty in the career field. I especially don't claim to understand a relatively new vaccine that just passed fda regulations a few months ago. Just because they didn't aspirate the syringe doesn't mean it wasn't given into the muscle or fatty tissue. And even if it was given accidentally IV or in the artery, it doesn't necessarily mean the drug is ineffective. This needs more research both from a healthcare standpoint, and from a reader standpoint. Never take these headlines or what these people say at face value. I definitely don't know how effective or less effective this would make the vaccine. Not to mention joe rogan just regurgitates whatever he hears from other people. I doubt the man does any research other than smoking weed in a sensory deprivation tank.",

Most government programs worldwide follow UNICEF/WHO recommendation in their Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) programs. At present, the WHO does not recommend aspiration prior to administering a vaccine 7, 56. Current guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 57 recommend that aspiration prior to IM vaccinations may not be necessary, while similar Canadian guidelines continue to recommend aspiration 58. The US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 59 does not make any recommendations on aspiration at the time of vaccine administration. Without data indicating the need for aspiration during vaccination, ACIP is basically leaving this decision to the person giving the vaccine. A similar stance is taken by the US Immunization Action Coalition guideline 40 where aspiration is not mentioned in its recommendations for SC and IM injections in adults, and it states that there are \u201cno data to document the necessity of aspiration\u201d in children.\n\n[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5333604/)\n\nMaybe this is just new findings? I do remember the stab a pullback from when I was a kid.\n\nAnyway, Joe Rogan's just talking shit, as per his job description.

If it is not mandatory, then a very small segment of the vaccinated may experience unnecessary adverse effects. This is basic medical ethics.

A growing wealth of data indicates that injection into a blood vessel \\*may\\* be linked to certain adverse reactions.  Lab studies in mice published \\*may\\* support this, but research / data are not yet definitive.  \n\n\nSo yes, vaccine aspiration is generally \"not necessary.\"  However, that does not mean that pre-injection aspiration to check for a blood vessel will not help prevent some mRNA adverse reactions.  Personally I believe talking about this may help reduce vaccine hesitancy, esp if folk believe there may be a simple way to reduce their risk for side effects.... even if Joe's flippant way of discussing this is not exactly helpful.    \n\n\nThe OP's lack of nuance isn't crazy helpful either.

You could argue those people are wrong but I'm just explaining why he's confident.

Sure it's maybe taught that you don't NEED to but it's not like it's going to cause problems. People shouldn't give a fuck if they aspirate or not but we have this backlash of \"THATS NOT WHATS TAUGHT YOURE WRONG!!!\"\n\nMeanwhile the American Heart Association is still recommending you get half your calories from carbs which is literally what's causing heart disease. Completely unrelated but just an example of guidelines can be completely wrong. Medical students are taught guidelines, many of which are extremely outdated and/or wrong.\n\nAspiration can easily be done by any qualified professional. So let me just ask this, if someone only wants to get the vaccine if they aspirate, is the nurse going to say \"that's not necessary you idiot\" or can they just do it so we can be out of this hell hole?\n\nWhy is this the hill to die on?

One of the most extensive investigation on this topic was scrutinized by McGarvey and Hooper [11]. They reviewed deltoid intramuscular injection technique by 50 general practitioners and 50 nurses, and found that there was a lack of awareness of anatomy and proper injection techniques.\n\nThe recommended injection site is the midpoint of the deltoid muscle (the densest part of the muscle) or approximately 3\u20135 cm below the lower edge of the acromion on midway between acromion and deltoid tuberosity (Fig. 2). Excessive proximal site could lead to bursa injection, while excessive distal site could lead to nerve damage or injection into vessels [11,12].\u00a0\n\n\n\nhttps://www.anesth-pain-med.org/m/journal/view.php?id=10.17085/apm.2017.12.2.103",

Its incredible how quick everyone is to judge a guy who genuinely seems to just want to know the truth and do what he thinks is right for him and his family. I also really love all the comments saying Joe is an idiot and a washed up hack lol More people listen to his podcast than ever and hes truly hilarious and can be genuinely insightful, but the haters are right, hes just a washed up dumb ape and thats why hes getting paid millions to talk to some of the most intelligent and influential people of our generation (Not including Ben Shabibo in that group but they cant all be zingers)",
