Some of these laws were written so as to trigger bans automatically if Roe is ever overturned.\n\n[This article outlines relevant state laws neatly:](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-policy-absence-roe)\n\n* 22 states have laws that could be used to restrict the legal status of abortion.\n   * 8 states retain their unenforced, pre-Roe abortion bans.\n   * 12 states have post-Roe laws to ban all or nearly all abortions that would be triggered if Roe were overturned.\n   * 9 states have unconstitutional post-Roe restrictions that are currently blocked by courts but could be brought back into effect with a court order in Roe\u2019s absence.\n   * 7 states have laws that express the intent to restrict the right to legal abortion to the maximum extent permitted by the U.S. Supreme Court in the absence of Roe.\n   * 4 states have passed a constitutional amendment explicitly declaring that their constitution does not secure or protect the right to abortion or allow use of public funds for abortion.\n* 15 states and the District of Columbia have laws that protect the right to abortion.\n   * 2 states and the District of Columbia have codified the right to abortion throughout pregnancy without state interference.\n   * 12 states explicitly permit abortion prior to viability or when necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant person.\n\nEdit: [And Wikipedia has some nice color coded maps of the same info.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States_by_state)",

Where is the data to back up that all people in Mississippi want to change the abortion law because of God? It may have some factor but there is no data to back that up. It may just be that is where the moral compass of the people is. So the Mississippi law currently going through the Supreme Court bans abortion after 15 weeks. That\u2019s not as restrictive as France. You can\u2019t say that France has their law because they are Christian. It is just what they have decided on based on their moral compass. The issue with Roe versus Wade as a law is that it was based on privacy. If one supports the Supreme Court decision, it needed to be based on stronger grounds legally speaking. The way the decision came down left the door open to be challenged. By the way, this is a nice discussion. This is rare. Usually people have one-liners that are pissed off for some reason.

Furthermore, Christianity demands that it's followers \"moral compass\" is based from Christianity/the bible. This leads me to believe that this opposition to people's ability to choose abortion is based of of their Christan beliefs.\n\nI'm not a historian of french history and have no knowledge about it's abortion law.\n\nTo the best of my (non-lawyer) understanding, the Roe v. Wade is grounded in privacy, but was expanded in Planned Parenthood v. Casey which added autonomy. To override the privacy protections for abortion would expressly include an override of autonomy provided by abortion. That said, the grounding of any law is \"people made a decision and it was enacted into law (some way shape or form)\" and the \"door to challenge a decision is open to anyone willing to walk through it\".",

Science definitely comes in to play as to when life begins. Parenthood vs Casey is also a disaster of a case. That decision was split so many different ways by the justices. The actual law is so unclear. It moved the needle from no regulation of abortion in the 3rd trimester to only in the case of a non viable fetus. States could still regulate abortion of a viable fetus but you had to show compelling state interest. That actually cut into the Roe decision. Constitutionally there is no right to privacy. I know that\u2019s messed up. These decisions have been arrived at via substantive due process which is weak. That leads to now!",

And when you try to challenge with any argument you\u2019re told \u201cthink for yourself\u201d or they bring up very specific cases to go in the offensive.  As a collective the policies in these states have hurt their citizens by nearly every metric. Of course there are some exceptions, but not many.  So a suggestion is to turn off the Fox News and talk radio and look at the numbers. Unlike conservatives these days, most people in the middle or left do not want to hurt the other side.",

Could be that what I'm seeing is more localized whereas the data is nationwide. Could be something to do with how the poll was taken, I don't know. I just know what I see myself around where I am. It's certainly not that I *notice* it more in women than men. Why would I do that? I mean, I notice what I notice. It's not like I'm actively searching for this kind of behavior in people. I can guarantee that, on a localized level, there are more Anti-vax and anti-abortion types in general around me than this poll shows just based on the fact that I live in a *heavily* conservative area of the US. It's not far-fetched to think that the rest of the data is similarly effected by that. \n\nAs for the vaccine thing, that's not surprising at all. It's what I would expect. Not being vaccinated doesn't make you Anti-vax. Being against vaccines makes you Anti-vax. Men tend to care less about their own health and welfare than women as evidenced by differing insurance rates among the sexes and the fact that a lot of dudes will avoid hospitals like the plague unless they are in some pretty serious pain. They will almost certainly be less likely to be vaccinated, even if they know they ought to be.",

Was one of my closest friends - from sleep overs to spring break roadtrips.  Fast forward, I was running for a local election and asked if he'd be willing to donate any amount; a simple no would have been totally fine.  He had decided that he was now 'born again'.  Instead of just a simple no or such, he goes on to tell me that if he supported me, he would go to hell because I am pro-choice and I would do things that would help kill babies and go against god.  In other words, instead of a polite no, he basically took the opportunity to tell me that I am an agent of  evil and that he was too holy now to support anything so evil as me ...one of his former best friends...since he was a kid.  I said cool . . . And then sent in $100 to Planned Parenthood in his name.  I told him every time he brings up religion or any of his bullshit to me, I donate.  \n  \nThat motherfucker kept deciding to bring up religion, even after warnings that I would follow through again.  In effect, he chose to be the 'agent of evil', cause damn right I did.  Again.  And again. And again.  \n  \nThat motherfucker has supported more abortions than Trump at this point.",

I think this is a really positive step, but I wonder how many teenagers are aware of this service? I also wonder how many can access this service? Particularly at the moment. This will also be problematic for some who are pulled out of PSHE (sex ed) class by their parents, which is a right of the parent. As an ex-teacher and Mum, I am also disheartened by the constent degrading of importance of these lessons. From my experience PSHE lessons have been religated to tutor time to be delivered by non-specialist teachers. In my opinion this could lead to poorer understanding by students. I guess there are a couple of points here. Should the state interfere with the rights of parents to bring up their child as they see fit? Should parents have the power to infringe their children's rights around sex and taking part in sexual activities? Is the state sexualising children by giving access to free contraception?",

One of them is a deep heartfelt belief in that religious mantra, no matter what that might be.  I'm a n adult life'd atheist.  What I have seen in recent years are questions being asked of those who are members of the Satanic Temple are not the same as those of a Baptist Church, as an example.  You almost never hear of someone questioning a Baptist of their devotion to their religion, but it has been brought up in print numerous times of a member's devotion to the belief associated with the The Satanic Temple.\n\nFrom Prayer, to Holiday Seasonal Decor; Time and again we've seen the Satanic Temple blocked from things that other's are granted without even a nod.  So to simply say \"Oh, well just join the Satanic Temple and all of your worries are in the past\" isn't a valid response to the overwhelming test that women in this nation are going through.  \n\nThere is no religious test for abortion in Texas, for example.  FFS, there's NO exceptions for it under the new law.  6 weeks, and that's it.  No clause for incest or rape victims.  After 6 weeks, it's \"So Sorry Shirley, there's nothing that can be done\"  And if you DO happen to find a doctor that will do the abortion, They'll be sued by every Jesus freak that hears of it.",

One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.\n>* 2. The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.\n>* 3. One\u2019s body is inviolable, subject to one\u2019s own will alone.\n>* 4. The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.\n>* 5. Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.\n>* 6. People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.\n>* 7. Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.                            \n\nI see no reason to worry about being a Satanist, this particular group sounds better than most of the Catholics I know.",

The reality of birth control is that 9 out of every 100 women who take it every day line they should will still get pregnant every year. Condoms result in 18+ pregnancies out of every 100 women. Injections 6 out of every 100, the patch and the ring 9 out of every 100, and the diaphragm 12 out of every hundred. Considering the percentage of pregnancies that end in abortion is around 11%, it\u2019s clear that 99% of abortions are definitely NOT performed for birth control. Thanks for playing, but you failed big time here.",

I\u2019m becoming more and more embittered by the current state of affairs, and society continues to tear at the shredded remains of my nearly unrelenting optimism. When I\u2019m seeing headlines where the Church of Satan looks both more reasonable and more Christlike towards their neighbors than many church members?! It\u2019s too much. And, from a well read theistic perspective, not much has given more ammo to Atheists than Theocracy, so I\u2019m worried for the best part of the church (feeding the poor, etc.) being buried under the worst of humanity (Theocracy combined with the shadow Oligarchy that\u2019s planned and funded this attack on Democracy).",

And he really means all of them, he says, because what matters to this discussion \u201care properties of minds that are found in all members of our species with normal brains\u201d.\n\n>Let\u2019s take a look at some of these properties, beginning with one known as Hypersensitive Agency Detection Device (HADD).\n\n>Say you\u2019re out in the savannah and you hear a bush rustle. What do you think? \u201cOh, it\u2019s just the wind. I\u2019m perfectly fine to stay right where I am.\u201d Or, \u201cIt\u2019s a predator, time to run!\u201d\n\n>Well, from an evolutionary perspective, the second option makes the most sense. If you take the precaution of fleeing and the rustling ends up being nothing more than the wind, then you haven\u2019t really lost anything. But if you decide to ignore the sound and a predator really is about to pounce, then you\u2019re going to get eaten.\n\nThe tl;dr of that article, is that we evolved with an imagination that helped us avoid predators, and evaluate threats.  That is not a default belief in a god/religion, merely an ability to make one up to answer a question we don't have an answer for.",

It's the removal of a clump of cells.\n\nNobody has proposed a law that forces you to get the vaccine.  The government says if you want to work with them you must have it.

If businesses refuse to do business with you..tough shit.\n\nBiology and imminogly...yet you don't trust a vaccine...you don't know how vaccines work do you?",

They found these comforting lies much easier to swallow then the hard truths of the situation, choosing instead to run from their inadequacies by forming their own narrative in which they are some sort of rebellious hero standing up against an unjust society when in reality they are little more then a child. A being who is desperately looking for anything that will give them some sense of identity, unconcerned with the consequences of their actions due to their inability to understand the effects of their actions on others. All of which stems from them being a lost and deeply insecure person who is so focused on themselves that they can\u2019t possibly recognize the fact that they are deeply wrong despite overwhelming evidence proving that point\u201d\n\nNow fuck off",

An example is if I was discussing Issues with school's in the U.S, mentioning that school's in Ireland also have issues doesn't really pertain to the discussion. While yes we can acknowledge that their might be issues with schools elsewhere but that doesn't matter in this discussion and is just muddying the water. When talking about abortion sure Male's have some part of the discussion being fathers but is overall irrelevant when discussing the rights a women has with their own bodies.",

I control what has impact on me directly, but when my actions can have an impact on others, it's no longer 'bodily autonomy.' I can do whatever I like when it comes to handling myself and my person, but when it comes to interacting and being part of a society as a whole my actions must fit in a way that works for the masses.\n\nWhen your actions have the ability to impact another person or the society as a whole that is different than how you choose to act as your own singular person. As one off topic example: this is why some states allow you to consume cannabis if you want to, since it's something you do to your own person, but you are not allowed to drive under the influence of cannabis because then you are a liability to others. You don't seem to understand that difference there of personal choices vs responsibility to the whole and innocent people around you. Nobody gets harmed when you consume a good you bought at the store, but when you operate a vehicle in a public space your actions have the ability to harm others, so are therefore regulated in an entirely different fashion. Just like your abortion vs hinting at vaccines-should-be-about-bodily-autonomy-and-are-not-public-health conversation topics.",

Those people will not stop there entire life in their pursuit. Yet as a country, the usa is stupid. As a country, the usa is not a group of united states. As a country, the usa is much like NY; in the sense that it is ridiculously structured, unrealistic living conditions, & nearly impossible to change unless totally scrapped. The usa is fucked because they allowed the wrong people to make decisions; as if those same people were modern day versions of kings & queens & upper class citizens in a monarchy/hierarchy.\n\nWe are fucked due to the apathetic & complacency of the people yet are not united. Some countries got this realization right. The usa has not.

His campaign made it very clear where he stood on issues, and while it stopped short of actual calls for violence (they always do) it was painfully clear where he stood. He won election so...clearly people support them.   We have literally ~~nazis~~ white nationalists marching in the streets and you are going to tell me \"no one supports them.\" They may not be the majority but to say their ideas don't have support is clearly wrong.\n\n>And you've named them \"the enemy\"\n\nSo...what should I call people that actively campaine for my death?\n Should I meet them halfway somehow?\n\n>and implied that everyone who opposes your position on one topic myst belong to that group, even though that's a riduculous idea. \n\nI mean, I'm pretty far into anti-nazi camp.

They're just some ridiculous stereotypes you made up so you can feel part of the 'pure' side of an epic struggle between good and evil.\n\nThis is clearly a side, the man I cited clearly exists, his followers clearly exist. The nazi march in Charlottesville clearly happened.  Matt Shay's writing clearly exist. The groups he worked with clearly exist as they have also had legal trouble and been in the news. And if nothing else, there's a vast historical record of such people existing. So to say it's some made up stereotype is, frankly, bullshit. \n\nAnd to say I'm some how trying to be on the 'pure' side of good?  If you find yourself defending nazi's, you probably aren't on the 'good' side. \n\nThe idea you are dancing around is the [paradox of tolerance.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance). That an open and free society can be too tolerant. That it will crumble to authoritarianism if you do not defend it.  In short The only thing a tolerant society can not tolerate is intolerance.",

If 2% is correct that's just 6.58 million. If we're generous and go with Gallup, about 13 million. Which means just from married couples alone they'd have as much as 10% or more of the homosexual populations information. \n\nLet's not pretend like looking up marriage records would be a problem for them. This is a serious issue, if it comes up, and just because some of us can hide doesn't mean it wouldn't be absolutely horrific. I don't imagine any gay person in America would feel safe if they started stripping gays of their marriages and backsliding into being murdered in the streets from time to time.",

To be clear, I'm neither religious, nor do I think abortion should be illegal, but I don't understand what religion has to do with this.

It's always going to be the arbitrary elevation of one right over the other, or the claim that the baby doesn't count as a person (although this will also always be arbitrary and subjective). Literally no religion required for either position to be held. From the perspective of the person opposing legal abortion, they're not even introducing new legislation/authoritarianism, as murder is already illegal, and they just don't accept the argument that the baby shouldn't count as a person covered under murder laws.",

Fetus isn't even strictly a developmental term (like embryo or zygote), as human 35 weeks past gestation is still a fetus if its within the mother but a human 28 weeks past gestation is no longer a fetus if it has been born. A fetus is just a more specific definition of baby that limits it to a particular location.",

A breastfeeding baby, even if you can argue needs the mother's sustenance, it is outside the mother's body. It doesn't need an abortion as it isn't a parasite anymore.\n\nIf you think that they will stop using the same talking points after we all agree to your version then you're being very much naive. If we are arguing on the question of what arguments will be better infront of the conservative judges of the SCOTUS, then I will agree that your point will be more agreeable. But, we are not doing that.  We are talking about the truth and people getting turned off from it. The \"parasite\" argument is a truth. It doesn't mean your \" bodily autonomy\" argument is false. It's just more palatable.",

Did you forget to put \u201cno longer\u201d or \u201cif\u201d in there? Regardless, I don\u2019t think you understand what \u201cand/or\u201d means because the way you (I assume intended) to phrase it indicates that it is a parasite if either condition is satisfied. A breastfeeding baby is still drawing sustenance from the mother. By the definition you laid out, via the and/or condition, that alone is enough to make it a parasite.\n\nBy any definition that strains itself enough to include a fetus as a parasite, a breastfeeding infant is one. If you want to define it as living inside the host, you\u2019re excluding obvious parasites like ticks and leeches. So again, if your justification is that a fetus is a parasite, you need some additional reason for why it\u2019s okay to kill it and not an infant. If the reason is that it\u2019s outside the mom, I ask what change happens as it passes through the birth canal. What, fundamentally, is different between a baby one minute before it comes out and one minute after?",

That's exactly why I somewhat agreed to your argument as it contained the \"body autonomy\" argument in one part.\n\nI gave you the meaning of sustenance above (which involved \"essential things\" for survival) and you're still arguing about about the breastfeeding baby. Mother's milk is not \"essential\" for the child's survival. It definitely helps the child but it's not essential. If you want to strain the definition of \"sustenance\" then I guess a twelve year old child can also be called a parasite, but we are not playing the strain game here. \n\nThe and/or part was an overreach on my part as I wanted to put two arguments in the same sentence. I wanted to have the \"parasite\" and \"body autonomy\" argument in the same sentence and I thought you will understand it. It's definitely my fault.",

Since there are alternatives to her carrying it like there are to breast milk, seems to me that at 24 weeks it\u2019s not a parasite by your contorted definition. Should abortion be prohibited after that point? I get that it\u2019s still inside the mom, but if, as you\u2019ve acknowledged, a fetus is a living human being, should we be allowed to kill it if there\u2019s an option to save it while also relieving the mother of the burden? I think that\u2019s an absurd opinion but I also think it\u2019s a natural consequence of the \u201cparasite\u201d argument.\n\nYou\u2019re about to stumble into the point I\u2019ve been trying to make. Whether or not the fetus is a parasite or viable or whatever else is irrelevant. The true distinguishing factor is whether the mother\u2019s bodily autonomy takes priority over the fetus\u2019 right to life. That\u2019s the argument people need to be trying to make.\n\nWhether or not parasite is a factual characterization, which I would argue it really isn\u2019t, is meaningless. It\u2019s loaded language that makes moderates who could potentially be convinced otherwise think that abortion activists are completely nuts. It is downright detrimental to the cause. If being \u201cfactually right\u201d (again, I\u2019d disagree) is more important to you than trying to protect the right, then continue on the path you\u2019re on and watch as it gets systematically gutted.",

Nobody is arguing that. And those laws you\u2019re talking about were made when women couldn\u2019t hold a job or support herself outside of marriage. They will no longer stand today if we have states making it illegal for women to make decisions about their own bodies and forcing them to carry pregnancies they don\u2019t want.",

The purpose of the act was to legally recognize fetuses as people when the mother is a victim of a violent crime that injures or kills the fetus. They had to pass that act to be able to charge the husband with two counts of murder, because without the act, they couldn\u2019t have charged him with anything related to the fetus BECAUSE THE LAW DOESN\u2019T RECOGNIZE A FETUS AS A PERSON.\n\n>Almost all of them are based upon legal precedent.\n\nWhich ones? What laws are you talking about? I\u2019m talking about the new spate of \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d that have been passed by many states over the past few years.\n\n>Laws did in fact exist before Roe v Wade if you didn\u2019t know. None of those laws affect forced child support or housing.\n\nWho said they did? I\u2019m talking about new laws that we will demand be made to force men to pay for pregnancies *they create* that a woman has no choice but to carry.\n\n>So you\u2019ve moved the goalpost now. From \u201cthis ruling will cause any women to be able to claim child support from any man without proof\u201d, to \u201cpeople might make laws to do it\u201d, which would be stupid in of itself, and there is nothing stopping it from happening already.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty stopping it already, like the law not recognizing a fetus as a person. And I was very clear when I said laws would be MADE in response to the overturning of *Roe*, not that things would suddenly happen. But legally, I suppose they could and likely will, even without any new laws being passed. Because there will be plenty of women that start suing men for financial support during pregnancy since the men *created* the pregnancy and the woman doesn\u2019t have any choice but to carry it. It will likely make it to SCOTUS, and then we\u2019ll get to see how all those conservative justices really feel about the unborn.\n\n>You don\u2019t know the law. Every single time you\u2019ve stated that the default would require the man to disprove his fatherhood to get out of it, but that doing so would constitute rape. You clearly don\u2019t know the law, because that\u2019s not how the law works.\n\nHere\u2019s 10 videos I found in less than 2 seconds about men paying child support for children determined by court-ordered DNA tests not to be theirs:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/UH9fnRnEcr0\n\nhttps://youtu.be/BJJ5Z_5lllw\n\nhttps://youtu.be/B6JS__PsI0w\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NMxaZkDUfrE\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cvqnLhYu334\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ouCVEbqRib8\n\nhttps://youtu.be/J14UYWJQUNI\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oYCEJtG4k44\n\nhttps://youtu.be/drI1YdbTSx8\n\nhttps://youtu.be/8WG8u_BQaYU\n\nCourts are very reluctant to remove support for a child, especially if there\u2019s no other person to step in to pay. Why? Because courts always do what\u2019s in the best interest of the *child*, not the adults involved.\n\n>Better than someone who somehow thinks that a change in abortion law would suddenly change dozens of entirely unrelated laws, that have nothing at all to do with it.\n\nHow does removing a woman\u2019s ability to choose whether or not to continue carrying a pregnancy not have anything to do with a man\u2019s responsibility to provide for that woman during the pregnancy that she has no choice in carrying?\n\n>I do not. This is just a shitty attempt at a personal attack.\n\nLet\u2019s keep in mind here that YOU replied to MY comment, not the other way around, and one of the first things you said after I responded was that I was full of shit and didn\u2019t know what I was talking about\u2014despite the fact that I\u2019ve not only been through this before, but went through it as a kid, have several close family members and friends who have been through it, and have a best friend who is a fucking family court attorney. I mean, it\u2019s really not *that* complicated, and there are plenty of men all over the country paying for children that aren\u2019t theirs.",

I\u2019m really not concerned with what some internet stranger, who can\u2019t defend any of his positions yet wants to call ME names and attack MY positions, thinks about me or any other woman just trying to defend her rights to bodily autonomy. The track record this country\u2014and humans in general\u2014has with issues of equality and women\u2019s rights is shameful (though certainly not as bad as some other parts of the world), and it\u2019s the Christian Right that has been driving it in America since the first settlers stepped foot on these shores. \n\nWe were always promised a wall of separation between the church and the state, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019ve been getting this whole time. So if they want to play around with our lives and our rights, we will just have to play around with theirs.",

An in vitro DNA test can cause problems to the fetus and even death. \n\n>and claiming that to demand evidence is considered rape, is sexist as hell.\n\nForcing a vaginal ultrasound on a woman against her will is rape. Sorry you don\u2019t agree, but it\u2019s not sexist. What IS \u201csexist as hell\u201d is thinking it\u2019s ok to subject a woman to being penetrated against her will for no good reason. An ultrasound won\u2019t tell you who the father is stupid.\n\n>Nobody\u2019s right to life is being violated, or even at risk of being violated when you don\u2019t do that, \n\nThe woman\u2019s right to life is being violated big time. Pregnancy and childbirth are more than 14 times more deadly than complications from abortion can be. A woman\u2019s health, life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness are all being violated by forcing her to carry a pregnancy she does not want.\n\n>whereas the child\u2019s right to life is being violated in an abortion.\n\nA fetus is not a child. Therefore no child\u2019s rights are being violated.\n\n>You are actively wanting to push horrific and discriminatory laws as a way to \u201cget back at men\u201d\n\nWhat is horrific or discriminatory about a man having to provide for a pregnancy HE created?\n\n>You also don\u2019t understand the first thing about the separation of church and state either if you think this is at all an issue pertaining to that.\n\nThe entire anti-choice movement in the US was created and has been propagated by the Christian Right. The idea that a fetus has the same rights as a person is an idea that only came to be because of the Christian church telling its parishioners that they do within the last couple hundred years. Before that, a person was not a person until it was born alive. But now, they use scriptures that have nothing to do with this to spread their message\u2014despite the fact that abortion was common in the times the Bible was written and it even specifically mentions that the unborn are not equivalent to born people\u2014and completely ignore the science that contradicts this. \n\nYou will not find an anti-abortion group of any real influence that is not also a Christian organization. The states that have passed these anti-abortion laws are all run by \u201cChristians\u201d that farm votes from Christian voters. And the deciding votes from the Supreme Court justices that will likely overturn a 50 year legal precedent will come from two lifelong Catholics who strong ties to the church.\n\nAnd don\u2019t tell me what I do or don\u2019t understand about the laws and rights we have in this country. My understanding comes straight from one of the most important figures in our country\u2019s history, Thomas Jefferson, who said in regards to the Constitution and the separation of church and state, that \u201cI contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should \u2018make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\u2019 thus building a wall of separation between Church and State.\u201d His words. Wall. \n\n>And again, no Supreme Court ruling would make abortion illegal. Only the state legislatures can do that. If you don\u2019t like it, either don\u2019t live in a state where it\u2019s popular, or try change the law.\n\nI\u2019m not claiming that any ruling would \u201cmake abortion illegal,\u201d because that\u2019s not how it works. What I\u2019m saying is that the Supreme Court ruling can invalidate the ruling it already handed down nearly 50 years ago that abortion is a woman\u2019s right and that no state shall make laws restricting that right. \n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what states *have already done*, in direct opposition to the Constitution, with the specific purpose & intention of restricting women\u2019s constitutional rights, with the ultimate goal of getting sued so the case could go to SCOTUS and be litigated AGAIN\u2014only this time by a court that is 1/3rd filled with justices appointed by the worst president in our country\u2019s history. \n\nYou may think that playing games with people\u2019s rights is a good thing now, when it\u2019s likely to end up in your favor, but I doubt you people will like it much when we start doing the same with guns. If you don\u2019t speak out against this type of judicial activism ALL the time, even when it results in something that is contrary to your own personal beliefs, then you have no right to complain about it when it goes the other way.",

I didn\u2019t propose any law. I simply said that if SCOTUS overturns a legal precedent recognizing a woman\u2019s right to make choices for their own bodies, resulting in multiple states making laws that restrict women\u2019s rights to make choices for their own bodies on the basis that a fetus is a person with all the rights of personhood, then women in those states need to start suing the men who created those pregnancies for child support and living expenses starting at the date of conception. If the law is going to force women to carry pregnancies they don\u2019t want, then the law also needs to force the men who created those pregnancies to pay for them.\n\n>allowing a woman to, without proof, name any man to be the father, and require the man to prove he isn\u2019t, but in order to do so, would require what you consider rape. \n\nI already asked you how you would propose handling it, and you have no answer.\n\nI also have explained several times now how a forced ultrasound is rape, but you won\u2019t acknowledge it, you just keep saying \u201cwhat you consider rape,\u201d like it\u2019s somehow up for interpretation. Either forcing a woman to submit to being penetrated by an object against her will is rape or it isn\u2019t. But stop calling it \u201cwhat you consider rape.\u201d\n\n>This entirely violates the basic concept of burden of proof and the right to due process, and shows you don\u2019t understand how the legal system works.\n\nWe are talking about civil litigation here, not criminal. Only in criminal court are you \u201cinnocent until proven guilty.\u201d Civil court requires you to prove you\u2019re not liable if you\u2019re being sued, just as much as it requires the plaintiff to prove you are. If a woman says you\u2019re the father, it\u2019s up to you to prove you\u2019re not.\n\nAnd really, stop telling me I don\u2019t know about this or that. I am disproving every single thing you are claiming I know nothing about, but you just keep saying it anyway. I think it\u2019s time you stop and consider that it is in fact YOU who doesn\u2019t know what you think you know.\n\n>Unless a woman can PROVE in a court of law that someone is the father, THAT MALE DID NOT CREATE THAT PREGNANCY. The burden of proof in a civil case lies upon the person making the claim NOT the defendant.\n\nAnd the burden of proof can be as simple as a woman saying, \u201cI had sex with him on this date, I got pregnant around this date, I didn\u2019t have sex with anyone else around that time, so he\u2019s the father.\u201d What, do you think a woman\u2019s not gonna have some text messages or pictures saved of being with that guy to show the judge? \n\n>Abortion is significantly more deadly than childbirth, it has, on a 100% fatality rate for the child.\n\nA fetus is not a child. Therefore, no children are harmed as a result of abortion. \n\n>Ensuring a child\u2019s right to life is not violated, at the relatively small chance that the mother\u2019s will be unexpectedly (if they know there will be health issues, an abortion would be allowed, as that would be an actual violation of her right to life) threatened is far more than a positive.\n\nSo a fetus\u2019 life is more important to you than a living, breathing person\u2019s life? Got it.\n\n>The law you proposed is discriminatory as hell, as, the way you proposed it (which would be illegal) removes the entire right to due process from men in the case.\n\nI didn\u2019t propose any law. See above.\n\n>Separation of church and state doesn\u2019t mean that the religious aren\u2019t allowed to have their opinions, even if informed by their religion, be part of politics.\n\nWalls work both ways. The problem that occurs when religious beliefs are being used to make laws is that another religion\u2019s beliefs will conflict with the first, and then what? \n\nJudaism does not consider a life \u201ca life\u201d until a baby takes its first breath, and in fact *commands* a woman have an abortion if her physical *or* mental health is at risk. The life of the mother is always more important than the unborn. Making abortion illegal in any state in this country is a violation of the rights of Jews to practice their religion freely. And that\u2019s just one example. \n\nReligious beliefs should never be used to make laws, and the Founders\u2014particularly Jefferson and Madison\u2014understood that very well because they had seen it first hand in VA when we were still a country of colonies. There were all kinds of different sects of Christianity then, and the ones in power would make laws that conflicted with the other sects\u2019 beliefs. Those men understood very well what they meant when they wrote the establishment clause, and that it was meant to keep religion out of government just as much as it was meant to keep government out of religion.\n\n>I\u2019m not playing games with anyone\u2019s rights. The rights of many children are ACTIVELY being violated and need to be protected.\n\nA fetus is not a child, therefore there are no children having their rights violated by abortion. \n\n>I honestly couldn\u2019t give a shit about guns, so stop being an idiot.\n\nHow am I being an idiot? *Roe* ruled that the right to abortion was enshrined in the Constitution, the same as the right to bear arms. If the court now turns around and says that right is NOT enshrined in the Constitution and may therefore be restricted by laws of the states, then every other supposed right that we think we have will be up for the same treatment. And guns will be first. I don\u2019t care whether or not you \u201cgive a shit about guns\u201d because this isn\u2019t about you. That\u2019s just the first and most obvious right that will be up for restricting next.\n\n>The Supreme Court deems what is and isn\u2019t constitutional. Nowhere in the constitution is the right to bodily autonomy protected over the right to life. \n\nSo you\u2019re alright with people being forced to take the COVID vaccine then?\n\n>Any laws that prohibit abortion past what the court defines as the development of personhood, other than in the case where the mother\u2019s life is at risk, would in no way be in violation of the constitution.\n\nThe court has already defined it in *Roe*. The states are making laws that are outside the terms of those definitions. Those laws are in violation of the Constitution according to SCOTUS.",

Don't necessarily think a woman should be jailed over abortion either. Do think we should restrict access.\n\nOk, let\u2019s take that at face value. You agree we shouldn\u2019t be jailing women over a miscarriage or abortion, but still want to restrict abortion. The people who want to restrict abortion are also trying (and in some cases succeeding!) to make women go to jail for miscarriage or abortion. That\u2019s already reality. By supporting their push at restricting abortion even further, you\u2019re tacitly agreeing to allow women to be jailed and that that outcome is better than an abortion. Do you really want some women to be jailed for a miscarriage because you just don\u2019t want some abortions to happen? Doesn\u2019t that mean you value the potential of a life than actual life?",

That's why the \"dependency\" argument doesn't hold water for me.\n\nI'm not suggesting that killing a 5 month-old baby is acceptable, just trying to point out that the argument that a fetus is a living human being with a consciousness, soul, etc., does not hold up when applying the same level of scrutiny to the death of gametes - sperm and eggs. And while I think Catholicism (1) is generally dogshit and (2) has caused great harm to society as a whole by forbidding contraception, at least said doctrine is somewhat consistent with reality (recognizing that sperm = life).\n\n>I don't yet have a formed faith. Formerly considered myself a gnostic atheist. After hearing more sophisticated conceptions of god and my own intuition that there is meaning and beauty in the world and right ways of being - I am drifting into spirituality. I don't think religion plays into my position on abortion. Having my own children was more transformational. Don't know that numbers passage will ever come into play for my views.\n\n>All the best to you.\n\nFair enough. I had assumed you were religious, because typically the two go hand-in-hand. I was very much against pro-choice legislation and rulings as a Christian, but my view has shifted considerably. Regarding abortion, I actually backslid for a short time to the Catholic stance in that I was unable to rationalize why, if abortion is wrong, contraception in general is acceptable. Because where do we draw the line as a society?\n\nThe important thing to emphasize is that 99% of people who get an abortion do not want to get an abortion. It is something that some do because they have to, which includes financial instability, unplanned pregnancy, birth defects, miscarriage, etc. By enacting legislation to forbid abortion completely (or even at 6 weeks), great harm will befall society.\n\nI highly recommend the book Freakonomics. It is apolitical and not religious. In fact, it was assigned reading for me in a high school economics class at a Mennonite (think Amish, but ok with technology) school. There is a section in that book discussing the effect of Roe v. Wade on society - e.g., reductions in crime and poverty.\n\nAn unwanted pregnancy is a lose/lose. It is a lose(parent)/lose(child)/lose(society) in situations where the parents cannot adequately care for the child. I do not believe that there is anything wrong with abortion. If you do, and if you seek to legislate it, I would argue that the state has a duty to ensure said child is provided for. I'd rather be aborted than grow up in an unloving, financially insolvent household any day.\n\nI wish you well too.",

And the significance is that it's not the mother's DNA, it is DNA for a separate human lifeform.\n\nI think the issue is that \"life\" is being confounded with \"personhood.\"\n\nThe zygote is the entry point to the human lifecycle... the zygote is it's own lifeform, separate from that of the parent organism, regardless of it's ability to survive outside of it's natural habitat (the womb.)  It is both biologically alive, and it is biologically human... it is a biological human life.\n\nIn the biologic sense, I don't think you can really find much, if anything that supports the notion that a zygote, embryo or fetus is not a biologic human life.\n\nIt's not about whether or not a zygote/embryo/fetus is a human life, it's about whether or not it is a person, or when the human life becomes a human person.\n\nPersonhood is a social construct - there is no right or wrong answer as to when a human life becomes a human person, there is only preference.  Some people think personhood should start at fertilization; some at viability; some at birth; and some ever later.",

Honestly, I get pissed off mostly at Manchin because Sinema seems to be less vocal about her disagreements (though, in all fairness, I try to not watch the news every f'n day for my own sanity).  That being said, Manchin is in a VERY conservative state and he's trying to do what's best for his constituents in addition to keeping his seat, so he has to walk a very fine line.  I feel like, sometimes, he starts out \"firmly\" but then negotiates and gradually walks back some his demands to give the appearance that he's not just \"rolling over for the libs.\"  In the end, having even only a few Republican votes on the first bill that passed was (imo) a huge win for Biden and the entire Democratic Party.  I also believe the second bill WILL pass, probably in the next 30 days, and probably without a single Republican vote.  I think Manchin will eventually get what he wants, which is a smaller price-tag, but when the CBO presents the numbers, in addition to some taxes on the wealthy, he'll eventually be on board with it.  Same with Sinema.  I've recently read a couple of good interviews with Sinema that have somewhat changed my viewpoint on her as just a money-grubbing do-nothing senator looking for a big payout when she gets voted out.\n\nTake this next statement for what it's worth.  I do almost all of my own investing, both for retirement and non-retirement, and read/watch a TON of financial and economic news.  Our country is CRAZY STRONG right now.  New unemployment claims are at, like, a 50 year low!  Inflation is up but it's \"mostly\" due to our issues with logistics (and I work in the logistics industry).  These issues are SLOWLY being fixed.  The price of diesel fuel has peaked and is actually started to move DOWNWARD (I get the weekly feeds from the DOE for prices across the country).  Our economy is ROARING back with a vengeance, despite the markets getting raped a few times this week.  I believe that 2022 is going to be economically HUGE on a historic level.  I'm just hoping that people realize this as they are going to be getting raises and their quality of life improve.  The US will NOT shutdown the economy due to COVID again, no fucking way that happens.  There may be vaccine mandates, but this will not adversely affect the economy.  If all of this VERY GOOD economic resurgence hits by this summer, then the election landscape for the Democrats is going to change VERY quickly for the better -- as my wife says, \"American's memories are about as long as their turds.\"\n\nCircling back to your original point; I think it's important to stay the course without pissing off two of the more conservative members of the Democratic Senators too much.  The Democrats have some VERY good candidates coming up for Senators (like Fetterman) that we could steal from the GQP even though the party in power generally doesn't do well.  If the economy is firing on all cylinders by Nov 2022, then I predict the Democrats actually pick up seats in the Senate (negating Manchin and Sinema's votes) and maintain or increase their positions in the House.\n\nI strongly think that everything hinges on the economy.  \"It's the economy, stupid\" is still the best way to gauge how the party in power is going to do.  Also keep in mind that in his first year, Trump's approval rating (38.4%) was STILL worse than Biden's (42.4%) and this will probably change rapidly.",

Not everything can be put on an incremental timeline.

This way they can have 4 courts of seven running each session. Each session the 4 courts are shuffled and populated at random to make it harder to game the court. We should also have a 75 vote confirmation in the Senate and if the Senate fails to confirm a new justice in 6 months then a randomly selected person from the next lower court is promoted to the SCOTUS.\n\nThis should take a lot of the politics out of the court and make them more respectable.\n\nEdit: And blocking of judicial nominees by the Majority leader(as done with Garland) should result in immediate expulsion of the majority leader.",

Because you know, we are just *making them* put up with our crazy secularist bullshit and it's just *too much for them to take!*\n\nFolks literally couldn't understand the idea that they could be just as religious as they want *in their own personal life* in a secular world, but instead found legislating their morality onto others was the only way they could live happy and free. How dare we here impose our way of life upon them. How dare we enforce a neutral idea upon them and let them do what they want in their own homes. We are all terrible people here for thinking live and let live could work! \n\nSigh. I just don't understand that mindset at all, and why it's so hard to let others live in a different manner of their choosing while you get to live in a manner of your choosing. You do you, and I'll do me, and for personal shit in our personal lives that works great. Your religion shouldn't impact the greater society as a whole, but you can be just as personally crazy as you want to be if that's your choice and you don't hurt others while doing so.\n\nEdit: Spelling",

If this had actually continued to today, I see this more of a dominant nation (Union) still subjugating its neighbors (the south) due to its economic might. \n\nTrying to compare this to something modern but removing other political implications, I would imagine something similar to Israel/Gaza or Russia/Ukraine where the dominant power has clear control over the situation even though the weaker country wants to exercise more autonomy, they simply can't.",

Vote in candidates who pledged to make slavery illegal, of course. And those in power (the white people) didn\u2019t want that to happen.\n\nOne of the worst pieces of legislation the US has ever written was called the Three-Fifths Compromise. It was in effect for many years, and was passed after the slave-holding states threatened to secede from the country if they weren\u2019t allowed to have their slave populations counted toward their total population that was used to determine how much representation each state has in Congress (the higher your population, the more representatives you get to seat in Congress). The non-slave holding states were against it, but they eventually came up with the compromise that counted 3 out of every 5 slaves toward a state\u2019s population. Another way to look at it is 1 whole human being was only being counted as 3/5ths of one if they were Black. \n\nIt was awful and it still a law that holds nothing but shame for this country, but it is along those same lines of what we\u2019re talking about here\u2014maintaining power.",

I don't think the overwhelming majority of people who support an overturn of Roe personally feel that way. As hypocritical as they may be if we compare other views they have, I think they sincerely believe they are fighting to stop the wholesale slaughter of innocent children. They don't give a shit about the actual science of fetal development or individual liberty unless it's in their favor. They also don't need any other motivation to act the way they do.",

Not every pregnancy is a fetus, calling every pregnancy a fetus seems like your crutch of a fallacy to try and get to people's emotions. \n\nThere are 4 paths to gain a new citizen to the USA. One way is through birth. I don't see why a current citizen should have their right to life and liberty removed by the state to endure a pregnancy to possibly maybe add a new citizen. In no other way through derivation, acquisition, or naturalization does a current citizen have their bodily autonomy rights taken away and a real risk to continuing to live free as pregnancy can kill so that maybe a new citizen can be added to this country. Really think why you're saying it's okay to risk a current child or woman's rights to life and liberty just to maybe add a new citizen to the list",

Wade.\u201d He then scolded the lawmakers for pretending to care about women\u2019s health and the well-being of the unborn and people of color while having the nation\u2019s highest infant-mortality rate, tolerating \u201calarming\u201d poverty and maternal-death rates, and curtailing health-care programs such as Medicaid. He accused legislators of perpetuating \u201cthe old Mississippi,\u201d the one that didn\u2019t allow women to serve on juries until 1968, the one that systematically sterilized Black women\u2014getting a \u201cMississippi appendectomy,\u201d it was called\u2014and the one that, in 1984, became the last state to guarantee women the right to vote. He recounted Mississippi\u2019s long history of denying its citizens\u2019 constitutional rights with segregated schools, prohibitions on same-sex marriage, and a \u201csecret intelligence arm\u201d that enforced racial discrimination. Far from helping women and minorities, Reeves wrote, the state still seemed \u201cbent on controlling\u201d them.\n\nThere are secular reasons to oppose abortion, and anti-abortion advocates have been playing up those reasons. It's just that the majority of them are blatantly obvious lies intended to push laws that are obviously unconstitutional and clearly abusive, and that it is _extremely_ obvious that abortion opponents could not give less of a shit about those reasons.",

That's a moving target, dependent on technology like life support systems. Physical resemblance to babies? Visible very early in pregnancy. The truth is that the question of when life begins is not merely a religious one but a scientific one, and the answer is increasingly \"quite early.\"\n\nThe winning arguments, in my view, are 1) rooted in the proper scope and role of government - abortion is difficult thing but it's not the place of government to restrict it; and 2) balancing the value of the unborn life with the life of the adult woman, especially in a society that has such poor medical and childcare services for those who can't pay.",

But, can someone smarter than me, please help out by providing a succinct definition/description of when \"life\" begins?\n\nIt's an irrelevant point.  In Ireland, [Savita Halappanavar](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741), a dentist, in the 2nd Trimester, went in with complications with a fetus with a heartbeat that according to some made it \"alive\" but  was told \"Because of our fetal heartbeat law - we cannot perform an abortion\" and that law killed her.\n\nYou might think that's an overstatement, but that was the same conclusion  that the final report by the overseeing agency . The Ireland and Directorate of Quality and Clinical Care, [\"Health Service Executive: Investigation of Incident 50278\"](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2013/06/savita-halappanavar-hse-report.pdf) which said **repeatedly** that\n\n* the law impeded the quality of care.\n\n* other mothers died under similar situations because of the \"fetal heartbeat\" law.\n\n* this kind of situation was \"inevitable\" because of how common it was for women in the 2nd trimester to have miscarriages.\n\n* if one was to save mothers and follow evidence-based medicine the main change needed to include changing the law because their evidence-based medical recommendations couldn't be implemented unless the fetal heartbeat law was changed.\n\n> the patient and her husband were advised of Irish law in relation to this.  At interview the consultant stated \u201cUnder Irish law, if there\u2019s no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, our hands are tied so long as there\u2019s a fetal heart\u201d.  The consultant stated that if risk to the mother was to increase a termination would have been possible, but that it would be based on **actual** risk and not a **theoretical** risk of infection \u201cwe can\u2019t predict who is going to get an infection\u201d.\n\nand\n\n> The investigation team considers that the situation was complicated by the difficulty associated with the application of **the law in Ireland** relating to the termination of a pregnancy.  The investigation team is satisfied that concern about **the law**... **impacted on the exercise of clinical professional judgement.**\n\nThe report detailed that there was advanced care, preemptive antibiotics, advanced monitoring, but .... they just couldn't keep up with how rapidly an infection spreads and the mother is **killed** when in the 2nd trimester the fetus still has a heartbeat and met the definition of \"life\" but was septic and about to rupture like an infected appendix.\n\nIt's like doctors saying they can't take care of an infected appendix until it bursts. Nobody who has an inkling of logic or reason forces people to wait until a appendix ruptures (and spreads poisons like wildfire) before they can remove it. That non-logical, non-evidence-based, non-scientific approach takes what would be a normal situation that can be dealt with calmly and turns it into a flaming dumpster fire of a situation.\n\nWhen you read the report and all the attempts that staff took to PREEMPTIVELY help with antibiotics made it clear that even that wasn't enough  ...  this woman was killed because of the law forced \"belief\" over scientifically-validated, evidence-based, best-clinical-care medicine practices.\n\n>  **our hands are tied so long as there\u2019s a fetal heart\u201d**\n\n\nHeartbreaking decisions have to be made at all stages. \n\n* Do you remember the Terri Schiavo case?  [Terri Schiavo](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/jeb-bush-terri-schiavo-114730) was a **provably** blind, essentially brain dead person who's husband (competent, had power of medical attorney) and his doctors (competent) were stopped from giving her a peaceful end-of-existence by pro-lifers in the GOP who had house/senate/presidency and Bush called an emergency session, they passed a law, and stopped her husband and doctors from \"Murdering Terry.\"  It went to the supreme court which overturned the law and allowed him to remove her feeding tube. Autopsy showed that the doctors were 100% correct and her brain was dead and black throughout especially in the visual parts.  Tom Delay claimed to be at the forefront of the \"right to life\" movement and to \"Save Terri\" but when it came to his own dad ... he pulled the plug and [\"murdered\" his dad in the same way he accused the Schiavo's](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-mar-27-na-delay27-story.html)  We don't see \"pro life\" protesters outside hospice centers.\n\n* Are you familiar with childhood leukemia? Or other fatal childhood illnesses. One can keep life support going forever, but not without either massive pain or a fatal injection of morphine. It's a terrible day for the entire medical team and the families, but they make the decision to end life sometimes. For example a 1 year old was dying of pneumonia and her parents could have kept her \"alive\" for years on a heart-lung machine, [but made the most difficult decision to donate her organs in hopes of saving other children's lives.](https://imgur.com/gallery/zowfDac).  Sometimes it's a car accident that damages the brain, sometimes the chemo doesn't work, etc etc. Yet we don't see \"pro life\" protesters outside of child leukemia centers. Why?\n\nWho else but the loved ones in consultation with a competent, licensed, medical professional should make that choice? There is no age limit on heartbreaking decisions and that's true before and after birth.\n\nGovernment has **one role only** in this realm. To make sure that the people making the decision are working with medical expert(s) who is(are) well trained. Period\nSo forget the slippery slope of when is a human viable, or has a heartbeat, or is as old as Terri Schiavo. Follow logic instead of emotion and reject the nanny state.\n\nAnything else is pushing the nanny state to try to take away the ability of competent people to make well informed decisions and follow evidence-based medicine. \n\nThe consequences of pushing this nanny state is repeatedly seen in massively increasing maternal mortality (e.g. mom's dying and leaving orphans) and morbidity (mom's getting sick and/or losing the fetus AND their ability to live without suffering) each and every time this interference happens. The correlation between women getting sick and/or dying from these laws happens time and time again and is as clear as the correlation between the COVID-19 non-vaccinated and their deaths and the increase in deaths in society.\n\nGovernment isn't the solution to abortion ... Government **is** the problem because the last thing a family dealing with these terrible decisions want's to hear is \"I'm a bureaucrat from the government, and I'm here to help.\"\n\nSavita didn't get to make that decision because the law interfered with evidence-based medicine and the law \"murdered\" her.\n\nSo let's agree to not create a nanny state to stop competent people from following evidence-based medical advice from a competent medical team. That's true and consistent from fetus to childhood leukemia to brain-dead accidents of adults.",

It repeatedly failed. Women were dying, losing organs, etc. Whatever your decision is in that situation, that decision should be between the competent medical doctor and the competent mother without any government. It sounds \"great\" but each time that some social justice warrior with \"good intentions\" tries to implement the nanny state and interfere with evidence-based medicine, women die and get horribly maimed. \n\nThat is why your statement \"should not be an option\" is why we are not in \"violent agreement\" . Science and evidence-based medicine is violently *opposed* to a nanny state dictating what a competent medical team, following evidence-based medicine is allowed to do when working with a competent patient with full medical power of attorney.  \n\nTLDR; We don't need or want the nanny state. Competent people working with competent doctors don't need or want the nanny state.  These restrictions kill women.",

It was a long hard fight to make it so and some of those who fought hardest against medically assisted suicide ... used it on their own elderly parents. \n\n1.

Do you remember [Dr. Kavorkian who helped create the \"Death with Dignity\" Laws now legal across the US](https://deathwithdignity.org/learn/assisted-dying-chronology/) which allowed physician-assisted suicide? There too you had some people screaming about \"murder\" but not any more. Now it's acceptable and we don't see \"pro life\" people protesting in Oregon.\n\nWhat do all of the above have in common with each other and abortion? They are all cases of competent adults making a medical decision with the advice of board certified and competent medical team vs people pushing a \"nanny state\" to put a politician in between a competent person and their doctor(s).\n\nSome argue the slippery slope of \"when life begins.\" Some argue from emotion to use terms like \"murder\" vs \"women dying\"  but all of those are skirting around the main issue. The main issue is: Who else but the competent adults in consultation with a competent, licensed, medical professional should make that choice? There is no age limit on heartbreaking decisions and that's true before and after birth. It doesn't matter what you call it as long as one is consistent in your logic of wanting to adhere to best, evidence-based medical practices and making sure everyone is informed and competent.  \n\nGovernment has **one role only** in this realm. To make sure that the people making the decision are working with medical expert(s) who is(are) competent.  Period. Anything else is pushing the nanny state to try to take away the ability of competent people to make well informed decisions and follow evidence-based medicine.",

Medically assisted suicide is permitted in 11 jurisdictions in the U.S., BUT - if I'm not mistaken, all require the consent of the person who, based on medical criteria, has chosen to end their life.  For the record, I'm for that for anyone who is of \"sound mind\", it should absolutely be their choice.  The fact that it is allowed under the supervision of competent medical personnel is something that I feel should be allowed without question.\n\nYou keep using the term \"nanny state\" and I understand what you mean by that.  I too am a proponent of keeping government oversight and interference to a minimum.  However, a society needs a common set of law/rule.  Something as important as ending the life of a human being who has not the wherewithal to make that choice for themselves, without due consideration, should be governed by a common law.

In my view, and as I stated before, it simply shouldn't be allowed at the whim of someone who made bad choices.\n\nThere is. It's called the \"medical power of attorney\" which is automatically granted to parents both before and after birth up to the point in time when the child is old enough to make their own decisions. That means that this standard is already enshrined in law. It's the basis of the tragedies occurring all the time in child leukemia centers or brain trauma centers when \"the cancer wins\" or \"the brain is too damaged\" and actively ending the existence of someone breaks everyone's hearts.  Only if the person with medical power of attorney is incompetent or abusive can the state interfere. [Like this case where the parents were accused of murder for refusing to allow their kid's diabetes to be treated](https://www.denverpost.com/2013/07/03/court-upholds-parents-convictions-in-prayer-death-2/) . \n\n> shouldn't be allowed at the whim of someone who made bad choices.\n\nThat's why where abortions are legal there is a team of competent medical staff. It's not like one downloads \"iAbortion\" and presses a button. There's a process and part of that process helps stop child sexual assault and helps stop the practice of forcing child marriage.   The fact some feel some people abuse a system doesn't mean one creates a policy that increases death and morbidity (statistically proven) for those who need the services. That would be like stating that the government should ban access to dentists because some people make bad decision and go to dentists only to get pain medication and become druggies. There is regulation for who can be a certified dentist. There is regulation for who can be a certified doctor. Those regulations are already in place and require adherence to competence and evidence-based, best-practices.\n\n> What is your position on seat-belt laws? Should those too be abolished? What about COVID vaccines? Should the GOVT be free to mandate those? \n\nI see two parts to your question: \"Should\" and \"the right to.\" \n\nShould: I believe that public policy should be evidence-based and follow a risk/cost (or cost/benefit) model. That's true of all policies whether it's seatbelt, COVID, abortion, scrubbers on coal plants, etc. Unfortunately, few people enjoy discussing the statistical numbers showing seatbelt laws lowered taxpayer costs for things like first-responders, ER visits, highway cleanup of blood, disability payments, loss of productivity, orphans, etc.  \n\n\"The right\"= \"be free to mandate\": I follow the John Locke model which states that in a democracy, government is a social contract. That contract states that we \"give up\" certain tasks that we might do and follow guidelines and pay taxes to support that in exchange for asking the government to act on our behalf for what is a societal public good. Economies of scale. That's the basis of the US constitution which dictates which are allowed and which are not. If the government can show a policy follows that positive risk/cost/benefit model, without significantly affecting the rest of the constitution, then yes - that's part of what we ask government to do and was the reasoning explained in why the US Supreme Court allowed smallpox mandates. \n\n\nCombining those two: The stats on seatbelt mandates, the eradication of smallpox through vaccines mandates, COVID mandates all support the risk/cost/benefit . They do not interfere in personal medical decisions that are advised by medical staff following evidence-based medicine. In fact there are lots of people who are not vaccinated or get seatbelt/airbag exemptions because of personal health reasons and get medical sign-offs on those reasons. On the other hand, statistics show that abortion restrictions cause significant harms. In Texas when anti-abortion legislation restricted access to women's pregnancy health centers maternal mortality (e.g. death) **doubled**  (and morbidity like kidney failure and massive blood loss also skyrocketed). These laws DO interfere with personal medical decisions that are advised by medical staff following evidence-based medicine and women die from it.",

You end up in a coma. One of the other people on the bus would have died, but a quick thinking doctor at the scene figured out that you were the only person with the same blood type. The doctor performed an operation so that you two now share a blood supply. Your heart beats for both of you. This obviously isn't sustainable long-term, but will work for long enough to get a transplant for the other person. You did not consent to any of this, since you were in a coma, although your driver's license does say you are an organ donor. \n\nNow, when you wake up in the nearest hospital, you have been keeping this person alive for several days. They are still unconscious and you know nothing about them. Your personal choice may be to continue using your body to support their life until a donor heart is brought in. You may believe it is the *morally* correct choice, but would you say that everyone else should be *legally* required to make that same choice? \n\nLegally, we aren't currently required to. Even a corpse has the right to not be used to keep another person alive, if the corpse didn't consent in life. So why does a living, breathing person have fewer rights than a dead body?\n\nPersonally, I don't believe I could ever have an abortion, unless there was no hope of saving the fetus.

          "text": "So you are ok with killing mothers instead. There's a reason a strongly catholic \"pro life\" country removed antiabortion laws from the constitution.... women were dying because of it. If you are truly an atheist you'd value the science that shows that laws outlawing abortion kill and maim women. \n\nIn Ireland, [Savita Halappanavar](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741), a dentist, in the 2nd Trimester went in with complications and was told \"Because of our fetal heartbeat law - we cannot perform an abortion\" and killed her.\n\nYou may think that's an exaggeration. It isn't it's the same conclusion the final report by the overseeing agency Ireland and Directorate of Quality and Clinical Care, [\"Health Service Executive: Investigation of Incident 50278\"](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2013/06/savita-halappanavar-hse-report.pdf) came to which said **repeatedly** that the law (like the Texas law) impeded the quality of care. It went on to state if changes were to be made it needed to include changing the law because their recommendations couldn't be implemented unless the fetal heartbeat law was changed. \n\nEach time there's a ban on abortion maternal mortality and morbidity goes up. Mothers are MURDERED and/or permanently maimed by these laws (e.g. hysterectomies, kidney failure).  In [country](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310596) after country, [around the world](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0705-y), when abortion is legal, maternal morality (e.g. DEATH) goes down. Here's another more recent one. When Ireland changed their laws in 2018 to allow abortions ... Maternal mortality rates went to ZERO and stayed there from 2018 onward.\n\nSavita died.

It's like saying stealing shouldn't be illegal because someone might steal to feed their kids.\n\nStrawman argument. They *desperately* tried to save Savita's life. But because they couldn't do an abortion due to the \"fetal heartbeat law\" they had to wait until the fetus \"died\" and then burst like a rotting balloon to spread poisons throughout her body and causing organ death despite IV antibiotics and even injecting antibiotics straight into her heart. Quoting from the lawsuit/investigation\n\n> the patient and her husband were advised of Irish law in relation to this.  At interview the consultant stated \u201cUnder Irish law, if there\u2019s no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, **our hands are tied** so long as there\u2019s a fetal heart\u201d.  The consultant stated that if risk to the mother was to increase a termination would have been possible, but that it would be based on **actual** risk and not a **theoretical** risk of infection \u201cwe can\u2019t predict who is going to get an infection\u201d.\n\nYour points **actually are** (1) that doctors can't take care of an infected appendix until it bursts and (2) you want some faceless bureaucrat to tie the hands of a competent medical team following evidence based medicine working with a competent patient .... the nanny state.  Nobody who has an inkling of logic or reason forces people to wait until a appendix ruptures (and spreads poisons like wildfire) before they can remove it. That non-logical, non-evidence-based, non-scientific approach takes what would be a normal situation that can be dealt with calmly and turns it into a flaming dumpster fire of a situation.\n\n>  You and everyone else knows this isn't the vast majority of abortions.\n\nI don't know where this \"pregnancy is always perfect\" religious myth comes from. It certainly isn't borne out by evidence. Again quoting from the Savita investigation by Ireland's board of ethics\n\n> We strongly recommend and advise the clinical professional community, health and social care regulators and the Oireachtas to consider the law including any **necessary constitutional change** and related administrative, legal and clinical guidelines in relation to the management of **inevitable miscarriage in the early second trimester** of a pregnancy including with prolonged rupture of membranes and where the risk to the mother increases with time from the time that membranes are ruptured including the risk of infection and thereby reduce risk of harm up to and including death.\n\nDo you see that word, \"inevitable?\"  Because of how often it happens it is inevitable that there are complications in pregnancies EXACTLY like what Savita experienced. The investigation found other women in Ireland who ALSO died in nearly identical situations. That only counted death, not also the larger numbers of women who survived but nearly died, lost a kidney, had to have a hysterectomy to live, etc. \n\nIn Ireland, after they removed the ban on abortion, maternal deaths went to ..... ZERO for each and every year since that abortion ban was overturned. \n\nNot just Ireland. That's clear across the world in [country](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310596) after country, [around the world](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0705-y), when abortion is legal, maternal morality (e.g. DEATH) goes down and when it is imposed women die, leave orphans, and/or are severely hurt (e.g. organ death) \n\nHappened in the US too. Texas blocked planned parenthood in 2011 and [maternal mortality (e.g. DEATH) **DOUBLED** in Texas and in no other states](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-maternal-mortality-rate-health-clinics-funding).

Nope. They die because \"from everything they know\" it's better to sterilize themselves with deworming medicine. \n\nThe question is: Are we are going to use evidence-based medicine to inform public policy or have a faceless bureaucrat get between a competent, evidence-based medical team and their competent patient and have more cases like Savita's with the \"inevitable\" similar cases in the 2nd trimester?\n\nI don't have much hope for some because many of the same politicians arguing for laws against abortion and ignoring the evidence of maternal mortality are the same arguing against laws on masks and vaccines and ignoring the evidence of COVID mortality.",

This will change but not by a lot, I can't imagine that at 15 weeks for example, the foetus could survive outside the womb",

Very easy for them to render this ruling moot.\n\nIf they don\u2019t then the 10th amendment kicks in and it gets kicked out to the states. We will see a divide of red states with various limitation on abortion and blue states with none.  Right now, such a polarized climate, we don\u2019t need another line that separates us via ideology.  Especially if it\u2019s a geographical. Will only make polarization worse.",

Or idiot fathers producing dozens of kids among a handful of sidechicks. They never finished HS or even GS.\n\nThese mothers & fathers live on an **annual** household income of <$5,000, <$2,500 & even <$1,250. These represent ~85% of all 26 million households in my poor country.\n\nFor these families they can only afford to be responsible parents to at most 1 kid unless they start begging their parents/siblings/cousins/friends for financial support for the next 18-25 years. They even force their kids to work as soon as they can walk.\n\nThe wanted outcome of all these suggestions are\n\n* Abortion rates plummeting to as low as possible\n* Parents able to be financially responsible to the # of kid(s) they can solely support for the next 18-25 years\n* No more teen pregnancies\n* >80% of all 1st pregnancies occur solely to married couples starting at their mid 20s & <20% occurring after that age\n* Protect the health & lives of both mother & baby\n\nLegalized abortion came about because the system does not produce persons with informed decisions. If it did then the number of abortions would be a fraction of what it is today.\n\nIn the ~10,000 years prior to hitting a world population of ~1 billion it is very normal for women to give birth to ~6 children. About 2 of these kids reaches adulthood to have ~6 children of their own. Vaccines changed all that in the last +200 years where in all ~6 children reach adulthood to have ~6 children of their own. That's how we got to >7.9 billion in 2021.",

If you are against it, fine. Others aren't. Mind your own business.  Its not your place to make those decisions for people who aren't you.  \n\nSecond, life is sacred and worth saving or its not.  You cant argue killing human beings is wrong and then turn around and say that its suddenly fine in certain circumstances.  \n\nWhat you want is to save the lives you care for and ignore/end the ones you don't.  That's a cute train of logic.   It also highlights how completely full of crap you are.  You have zero authority or business telling other people what to do.  You aren't pro life in any sense, you hypocritical dick. You want dominion over other people's bodies",

I support adoption 100 percent but I just wish the price and process of adopting were less excruciating. Adoption is wonderful, I am not say it isn't and I am personally childfree but if I ever want kids I will adopt.

But if someone decides they want to have one, they should be able to get one, as it impacts no one but themselves. \n\nAlso, yes, I know the foster care/adoption system is flawed. Which is why it irks me so much when people talk about \u201coverturning\u201d Roe v. Wade (I personally don\u2019t believe it will ever be overturned) but don\u2019t mention the faulty foster care/adoption system. \n\nI believe efforts would be best in first reforming this system to where we can easily get children placed with great parents, then addressing causes that may lead to a person wanting to force an abortion. \n\nThat would be best in regard to both \u201csides\u201d, quotations as I hate diving people on lines like that. I realize it\u2019s a complex issue. \n\nI was adopted by family and didn\u2019t go through the system, but I agree with you that it does need massive work. Again, as an adopted child it makes  me frustrated when people talk about wanting to overturn Roe V. Wade without first fixing the adoption system. What happens to all those millions of children that are now out there to parents who don\u2019t want them? \n\nIf we had a working system it would be fine because children could be easily placed, but it\u2019s not really an efficient system at the moment. \n\nFix the system and fix root causes of forced abortions. \n\nI\u2019ve personally had several family members who have lost babies after trying for years, and some who have had a baby out of the blue after failed fertility treatments for years prior. Seeing the light on her face holding her child is why it just frustrates me that some people (not everyone) refuse to get a hysterectomy or vasectomy and then just abort their child because they don\u2019t want to have kids. \n\nAlthough I did not realize that it was difficult to get one in some cases, so I apologize for that. \n\nBefore a nervous system has formed, I would argue that there is no \u201cperson\u201d there. So I am more so against unnecessary abortions after the formation of a nervous system. And babies are not able to survive without their parents even after their birth. Take a baby away from its life supporting parents, throw it in the wilderness and it\u2019ll be dead before long. I understand what you are saying about non-viability but I just think that extends further. \n\nHonestly this conversation has been helpful for myself with reflection on ways we can improve the system. I wish we had more people who weren\u2019t so gung-ho about stopping all abortions without thinking about the ramifications on the broken adoption/foster care system first. \n\nSad.",

While we're at it, let's force women in prison to be surrogate mothers.  If they didn't want that, they shouldn't have committed crimes.",

No legislation has the force of law if the Supreme Court says otherwise, effectively making the court the editor of the Legislature and the Executive.\n\nIf the Mississippi legislature votes x law into force, and the state is sued, *and* that suit makes it to the Supreme Court, who find it -through the interpretation of the Constitution, case law, and reason - unconstitutional, then the S.C. has overwritten legislation.  I argue the ability to unmake law is just as important as creating it.\n\nI agree that the government retains the authority to ban this or that product or procedure or service.  Furthermore it *would* be preferable that a Constitutional Amendment be passed to guarantee the right to a safe abortion.  Likewise - like many people here - I agree that we need better lawmakers.\n\nMy contention is only that a strict separation of powers is far more complex given the oversight requirement of each of the branches.  I want to be sure, I don't think your interpretation is wrong per se, and its certainly how every law and civics textbook describes things, but I think the nature of reality muddies this significantly.",

In Ireland, [Savita Halappanavar](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741), a dentist, in the 2nd Trimester went in with complications and was told \"Because of our fetal heartbeat law - we cannot perform an abortion\" - so they put her on advanced antibiotics, advanced monitoring, IV antibiotics, etc. etc. And then the fetus burst unexpectedly like a rotting appendix and she died. The independent investigations afterwards documented in [\"Health Service Executive: Investigation of Incident 50278\"](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2013/06/savita-halappanavar-hse-report.pdf) said **repeatedly** that \n\n* the law impeded the quality of care. \n\n* other mothers died under similar situations because of the \"fetal heartbeat\" law.\n\n* this kind of situation was \"inevitable\" because of how common it was for women in the 2nd trimester to have miscarriages.  \n\n* if one was to save mothers and follow evidence-based medicine the main change needed to include changing the law because their evidence-based medical recommendations couldn't be implemented unless the fetal heartbeat law was changed.\n\n* They gave her advanced care, preemptive antibiotics, advanced monitoring, but .... they just couldn't keep up with how rapidly an infection spreads and the mother is **killed** when in the 2nd trimester the fetus still has a heartbeat but septic and about to rupture.\n\nquoting:\n\n> the patient and her husband were advised of Irish law in relation to this.  At interview the consultant stated \u201cUnder Irish law, if there\u2019s no evidence of risk to the life of the mother, our hands are tied so long as there\u2019s a fetal heart\u201d.  The consultant stated that if risk to the mother was to increase a termination would have been possible, but that it would be based on actual risk and not a theoretical risk of infection \u201cwe can\u2019t predict who is going to get an\n\nAnd that's why they changed the law in Ireland to remove the ban on abortions. And when that happened. Maternal mortality went ... to ... zero. \n\nIt's like telling doctors they can't take care of an infected appendix until it bursts. Nobody who has an inkling of logic or reason forces people to wait until a appendix ruptures (and spreads poisons like wildfire) before they can remove it. That non-logical, non-evidence-based, non-scientific approach takes what would be a normal situation that can be dealt with calmly and turns it into a flaming dumpster fire of a situation.",

A non-religious argument has to be based on facts and logic. Those are the facts. You don't like the facts? Sorry. Facts don't care. \n\n> Is legal abortion beneficial to society?\n\nScience and evidence shows that this is **only true** with the additional qualification that \"legal\" also means \"no bullshit limits that tie the hands of the medical team.\"  Adding restrictions like \"if rape\" and \"if health of the baby\" and \"fetal heartbeat\" cause death and disease to pregnant women in significant numbers because of how common issues occur that potentially could cause an issue. If a fetus is aborted early before it ruptures like a pus-filled balloon, then no issue happens. If you have a law stating that you can't because of potential viability, then evidence shows women dying with their kids a burden on society or end up so sick as to become a permanent burden on society themselves. \n\n> Are abortion bans harmful to society?\n\nYes. Same comment as above. History is filled with various societies banning/unbanning/restricting abortion. Each time that happens you see maternal mortality (and mobidity) rise/fall/rise in direct causal relation between these nanny-state laws and death/morbidity. \n\n> we can't even have a fucking conversation about whether or not it has to be a religious argument.  Go fuck yourself.\n\nInteresting that you get upset when asking to have a factual conversation and being presented with the facts.",

The government cannot forcibly remove an organ from your body or force you to take one into your body on an argument of being pro-life. \n\nBut that\u2019s different from the case of pregnancy anyway, as the government isn\u2019t inseminating women against their will or cutting their stomachs open as soon as the fetus is viable. In the vast majority of pregnancies, there was bodily autonomy by two parties to engage in the ONLY act that results in pregnancy, knowing the possible results. The question from that point becomes how long into the pregnancy is a reasonable period for a responsible person to terminate it, and at which point has that termination crossed a line and become immoral.\n\nRegardless, the crux of the issue *IS* exactly that. Should the court take a pro-life or pro-choice position, or should it remain neutral on issues? The conservative argument in this case and against Roe vs Wade is that, although it may not be an easy or ideal solution to all, the power to decide whether or not abortion is a right belongs to the Congress or to the people of the states, and not the Supreme Court, particularly by reading into existence a right that likely was very far from present in the intentions of the text it comes from. \n\nWhat you do to your own body that does not affect another person is your own choice, correct. The issue is when there is another person growing inside that body, (or at the very least a potential new person) that, generally speaking, is the product of actions willfully and knowingly enacted by the individual carrying the developing person and another individual. The issue is when you call upon the government to subsidize the forcible removal of said person/potential with tax dollars. The issue is when that person/potential has developed to a viable state and can function on its own, whether or not that amounts to anything. It\u2019s not simply a bodily autonomy argument. It\u2019s a mixture of morality, responsibility, science, legal philosophy, and a whole bunch more.",

You\u2019ve made a piss-poor argument that isn\u2019t central to the point in any way. Bodily autonomy is not sufficient to willfully terminate human life in all cases. You have to demonstrate that it is in this case. It isn\u2019t her body, it\u2019s a separate one she chose to risk growing inside her. Does that mean no abortion should be legal? No, of course not.

I wouldn't consider a bacteria innocent, or even really a wild animal innocent or guilty. They do not have the capacity for that sort of thing.\n\nHowever, innocence is irrelevant to me in this case. The way I'm using sentience here, no, some coma patients is not really sentient. Not in the sense that they have any brain pattern resembling any sort of thinking or activity like that. And we pull the plug on coma patients and vegetables all the time. If someone with no brain activity was connected to my body against my will, I should have the right to say NO and disconnect them, regardless if they're \"innocent.\"\n\n>And feel? Ok.. so you know nothing about the science of child bearing.. got it.\n\nWhat does childbearing have to do with whether or not a fetus has the capacity to feel harm? Sure, at a certain point in pregnancy, it is somewhat conscious and feeling, but I'm mostly against abortions at that point, and most clinics agree with me by heavily restricting them at that point in pregnancy. Usually reserved for if the mother's life is in danger. Point is, abortions are almost always performed at a point BEFORE anything we would consider human develops. No thoughts, no feelings, no brain capacity for any kind of process like that. Why should something like that override the autonomy of an already developed person? Should fetuses be given SSNs? These aren't rhetorical questions. Since you consented to the car accident, should the EMTs leave you alone when it happens?",

I may consult other people on advice , but ultimately something like pregnancy is completely  personal decision. \n\nTo your question, no because again nuances and complexities. Just curious have you heard about abusive situations where they are coerced into sex, marital rape( this usually happens more in developing countries), if they are a teenager ( the reason why I reiterate this is because some teenagers are not fit to carry pregnancy at that young of an age). \n\nI know you mean well, and I appreciate your viewpoint. It's just not as black and white as it seems.Pregnancy is risky and a very thoughtful decision to make. It is life altering in every aspect which is why I believe it is not fair for someone else to enforce that decision to carry on others especially when it is tied into legal issues. \n\nI know abortion comes up a lot but I also support other decisions too like keeping the child or giving it up for adoption , I support what they choose cause they know their problems  and life situation.

Otherwise victims of tyrannical regimes could be said to have no rights at all, which is plainly ridiculous. Jews in Nazi Germany had a right to live.

Anarcho-capitalism is founded on the non-aggression principle. That is, that the initiation of aggression against another human being is never justified. Taxation is theft, theft is an act of aggression, therefore the state is unfit to exist. The prohibition on murder comes first, because murder is the initiation of aggression.\n\nWho makes the rules?

But that view is morally incompatible with who I am now. It's not about net benefit, it's about humanity, and we have lost much of ours in deciding that something is only a human if it can survive outside the womb on its own. We allow women to be arbiters of whether or not they even get the chance to last long enough for that to be possible, and that is a right I do not believe they should have.\n\n>That is not brain dead, that is coma. Brain dead people cannot come back into their normal lives, they are gone except that their heart is beating and probably even that too is done with the help of external support. \n\nRight, that's why I think the analogy you used didn't work. A fetus is - usually - guaranteed to eventually be mentally active. So comparing it with someone who is brain dead and can never recover isn't proper. Coma is closer, but comas can last for years without progress or guarantee, while the longest you will ever have to wait for a fetus to be mentally human is the duration of its incubation. \n\nI understand sometimes pregnancy can be hard. That's not what I'm debating. But we live in a society that has abundant access to various forms of birth control, including post-coital contraception. And all that is if you decide to have sex in the first place. It's the same decision men are presented with: if you cannot handle the consequences, take adequate precautions or don't engage in the act. Personal responsibility.",

But we don't have the technology so the only options we have is to either terminate potential life ( because the woman does not want to undergo the effects of pregnancy) or the woman chooses to go through with it knowing the full risks. If pregnancy was easy( no complications) I would totally get behind your cause. But pregnancy comes with risks and lifelong damages that may be fatal. I am sorry but it is not my place to force someone to undergo such a risk.   \n\n>Right, that's why I think the analogy you used didn't work. A fetus is - usually - guaranteed to eventually be mentally active. So comparing it with someone who is brain dead and can never recover isn't proper. Coma is closer, but comas can last for years without progress or guarantee, while the longest you will ever have to wait for a fetus to be mentally human is the duration of its incubation. \n\nEventually be mentally active? But why ... would we wait for that? The person no longer wishes to continue pregnancy so why is there a reason to wait for it to be mentally active/sentient? \n\n\n>while the longest you will ever have to wait for a fetus to be mentally human is the duration of its incubation. \n\nFair enough, but you have to realise this duration comes with its own set of harms. Gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, hyperemesis gravidarum, death even. If pregnancy was risk free with zero harm to mother then yes your point will stand but even people with the easiest pregnancies have life altering changes be it minor( stretch marks,physical changes) to major(completely loss of bladder control, paralysis) etc.",

There are complications during the pregnancy that okay may not result in death but causes severe mental and physical duress. Even in developed countries like the United states where people have \"easy pregnancies\" many undergo lifelong changes and develop conditions. Your body undergoes physical, mental and medical changes after a pregnancy. Which is why I believe choosing to continue a pregnancy should be a choice. \n\n>Because it's a human. I don't want to accommodate other humans a lot of the time, myself. But I still have to, because humans have rights.\n\nIt is human but it is non viable , there is no chance of taking an embryo or a 1 month old fetus outside of the womb, it simply wouldn't survive anyway. Neither does it have the noiciceptors capable of feeling pain. Being a human alone, is not enough for the fetus to hold rights especially over the mother who is a living breathing viable human. The fetus is depending on the mother's organs not the other way around.",

The question isn\u2019t \u201cis it okay to kill babies?\u201d If it were, there would be no debate, because you don\u2019t have to be religious to know killing babies is wrong. The question is \u201cdoes an unborn fetus count as a sentient human life?\u201d Neither science nor religion can irrefutably answer that question.\n\nSo because we don\u2019t know, some people might say we shouldn\u2019t risk the chance that we are in fact murdering innocent children, and abortion should be banned.\n\nWhile others think that since there are such strong beliefs on both sides and there\u2019s no way (currently) to know which one is right, none of us have any right to force our beliefs on others, and all of us should be free to make our own choices based on what we believe is right.\n\nThat is my opinion, I suspect most of your opinions, and I optimistically would like to think it\u2019s the opinion that most of the world will eventually agree on as right and fair. I know there\u2019s a significant part of the world that doesn\u2019t see it that way, perhaps more than I implied in my original post, but that\u2019s completely beside the point.\n\nMy point is, at it\u2019s heart, the abortion debate is a scientific question regarding our current understanding of consciousness, and sentience, and a philosophical question regarding what it means to be alive and what it means to be killed. Religion has nothing to do with it.",

Religion has nothing to do with it.\n\ni'm not quite sure why you think religion has nothing to do with that? religion sits squarely at the intersection between the tangible world (in your model, of \"science\") and the ontological world of meaning. \n\ni'm not religious at all, but it's completely silly to think that no, religion has nothing to do with this and you shouldn't be allowed to conceive of the moralizing about the meaninfulness of life as a religious concept. it's very much a \"religious\" issue.",

There obviously are different issues that definitely do have a right and wrong answer, and we are justified in correcting people who make the wrong choice (murder, rape, robbery, etc\u2026) but abortion is not one of those. Isn\u2019t \u201cdon\u2019t force your beliefs about abortion on others\u201d literally the whole point of being pro-choice? I don\u2019t get why we\u2019re arguing this point.\n\n>not quite sure why you think religion has nothing to do with that\n\nAll I\u2019m trying to say is that if the pro-life argument is \u201cabortion is immoral\u201d then you don\u2019t have to be religious to oppose things that are immoral. Sometimes people blur the lines between religion, morality, philosophy, and science, and try to turn everything into a religion debate. But it really aggravates me when people force it. Especially with abortion, because it comes across as \u201cif you\u2019re not a Christian, then your a baby killer!\u201d\n\nMaybe that\u2019s not how everyone sees it, though. Just my opinions.",

I\u2019m sure she would agree abortion a few hours before the child is ready to be delivered would be murder. Abortion a few weeks before delivery would be murder according to most people, religious or atheist. \n\nThe two relevant questions is if the constitution protects that right, and if so where to draw the line.\n\nYou can also disagree with Roe v Wade and be pro choice. I tend to side with the majority, but it isn\u2019t the most clear cut area of law. Go read the constitution and you will see it requires quite a bit of creative thinking to get from that document to a guaranteed right to have an abortion.  The entire concept of substantive due process requires a bit of a leap.",

In many places, the same people arguing against abortion are arguing that we need to scale back sex education and make it harder for children to have access to contraceptives. It also completely ignores issues like rape, abuse, the ability of the parents to care for a child, the medical viability of bringing a child to term. \n\nBut if you think this argument is worth taking seriously, one last point.\n\n> there are very limited circumstances in which the termination of a human life is valid under these circumstances, particularly as fetal viability approaches and alternatives such as the forfeiture of parental rights exists\n\nAll current anti-abortion pushes in the US are designed to make abortion illegal or impossible _as early as possible_. Abortions in the case of fetal viability are extremely rare, and often already illegal. \n\nIf you are using arguments like this to seek common ground with the people who want to make abortion illegal so early that most women won't even know they're pregnant, I really have to wonder why.",

Plenty of general college philosophy courses will run through the secular and religious arguments on abortion and the primary secular argument you\u2019ll find is one that generally speaking leans on fetal viability and personal responsibility. To insist that that individual portion of the argument is a strawman is to separate two connected parts of the argument, which is not what I have done.\n\nThe secular argument is that a moral individual, should they find themselves pregnant and unwilling to carry to term, has the responsibility to terminate the pregnancy as early as possible for a variety of reasons, including fetal development. \n\nYou haven\u2019t actually explained why you consider it a bad argument though. You\u2019ve stated with ten year old data that half of all pregnancies were unintended. That\u2019s not a refutation of the fact that the vast majority of pregnancies occur between consenting individuals who are of an age and education level enough to know that pregnancy results from sexual intercourse. The only thing you\u2019ve shown is that half of pregnancies occur when the intercourse had a purpose of intimacy and pleasure rather than procreation, which of course is not inherently bad. \n\nIt\u2019s also incorrect to say that this point \u201cignores rape, abuse, the ability to care for a child, medical viability, etc.\u201d because, again, you\u2019ve separated the personal responsibility that causes the pregnancy from the second half of the position, when the two are uniquely wrapped in one. The fact that you then attempt to dismiss the very exception that the argument makes after claiming the argument doesn\u2019t make it is absurd. \n\nProviding contraceptives and better sex education is further policy prescription, but not directly the secular argument against abortion, which is why it was omitted from my original comment. Whether or not the general public holds the secular argument I\u2019ve discussed is irrelevant to the fact that there *IS* a secular argument that Sotomayor should not be ignorant to given her education and experience. \n\nAnd then your second attempted point doesn\u2019t serve you. Yes, abortions past the point of fetal viability are exceedingly rare, and generally illegal except for the specific exemptions like medical necessity that we\u2019ve already touched on, that the law in Mississippi in question allows. \n\nYou seem to be insinuating that the mere vocalization of a secular argument against abortion on demand is to court the company of those who would subjugate women to permanent status as second class citizens, and I completely detest that latter view.",

Hardly a basis for law (a responsibility to terminate the pregnancy as early as possible does not magically turn into the ability to predict the next 9 months of your life every time you have sex), but a somewhat reasonable moral argument.\n\nSo how is it used in court cases against abortion? Ah yes - to argue that there is a genuine secular reason why Mississippi should be allowed to ban abortions starting at 15 weeks. And yeah, that's a _bullshit_ argument, but it doesn't need to be good. It just has to be good enough to convince the conservative majority that they can pretend it's not bullshit. And the conservative majority is _really good_ at pretending that arguments aren't obvious bullshit. \n\n> You seem to be insinuating that the mere vocalization of a secular argument against abortion on demand is to court the company of those who would subjugate women to permanent status as second class citizens, and I completely detest that latter view.\n\nI don't think that's the _goal_. It is, however, the result. I'm sorry that your movement exists by and large as a historical footnote whose most significant achievent is giving religious bigots cover for their bigotry. I wish we could be having this conversation without caring about this context, but I can't really change that fact. If you decide to show up to a battle on one side, and your allies turn out to be the Hordes of Sauron, that reflects poorly on you, even if you joined the battle for reasons completely unrelated to your desire to subjugate all of middle earth. \n\nReligious zealots are taking your arguments and using them as a fig leaf to say, \"There's a secular reason to oppose abortion.\" They don't actually _care_ about your arguments, or believe in them, but having that fig leaf is very convenient. You can see it in action _in this thread_! \n\n-----\n\n> You haven\u2019t actually explained why you consider it a bad argument though.

That\u2019s not a refutation of the fact that the vast majority of pregnancies occur between consenting individuals who are of an age and education level enough to know that pregnancy results from sexual intercourse. \n\nI guess I have trouble acting like the problem is individuals acting irresponsibly when those errors account for almost half the total birth rate. It's almost as if there are larger systemic problems that mean that unwanted pregnancies are going to be a fact of life. \n\nThe argument is bad becuase it ignores those problems. It starts from the assumption that, for the most part, people who get pregnant had a good understanding of the risks involved. It starts from the assumption that this _massive_ failure rate is an individual responsibility, rather than any kind of systemic issue. \n\nThis is just not tenable. \n\nWe know what reduces unwanted pregnancies (and, as a result, abortions), and the answer is not draconian limits on abortions, it's easy access to better information and high-quality contraceptives. We _can_ point to individual points of failure, but it's not a productive or useful way to look at the issue. \n\nWe should not design policy around the assumption that anyone who fucks up has failed or is personally at fault when so many people so consistently fail. Turns out, humans are not robots. We have strong biological drives, we don't always make perfect decisions, we don't always have access to perfect information, and if you design policy designed merely to punish anyone who fails, your policy will generally be cruel and unhelpful. \n\nThe purpose of this argument seems to be to blame individuals for their unwanted pregnancies. Why? So that you can say \"they knew what they were getting into\" when they try to terminate the pregnancy? So that we can assign blame? **I just don't see how that's relevant to a woman's right to bodily autonomy**. There may be some moral difference between someone who got a second-trimester abortion because they couldn't get their shit together to do it earlier and someone who got a second-trimester abortion because they didn't find out about a life-threatening genetic disorder until that point, but that seems like a pretty inconsequential hair to split compared to the issue of \"should women be able to get abortions at all\".",

Medical exemptions aside, as they\u2019re included in the law, I don\u2019t exactly know that it\u2019s common past the four month mark for most pregnant women to encounter such life changing circumstances as to such that the termination of the pregnancy is a necessity for their own well-being long term. \n\nAnd again, that secular argument is not the basis for the argument currently in the Supreme Court\u2014you\u2019ve made that error multiple times. The presence of the secular argument is completely separate and irrelevant from the legal argument that the Court is hearing on whether the Court had the power to read into existence the right to abortion or whether that power belongs to the people, the states, or Congress. The only importance the secular argument has at all in this case is that a SCOTUS Justice was ignorant of the fact that there was one. \n\nAnd now, you\u2019re speaking from a standpoint of extremism that seemingly is the exact sort of bigotry you\u2019re protesting. You\u2019re insinuating that anyone with a religious belief on the morality of abortion is inherently bigoted (and undoubtedly there are bigots), even when that belief is that the fundamental act of creating a life should not be carelessly discarded for a person\u2019s convenience. To equate a standard person\u2019s views on abortion with the Hordes of Sauron is the exact sort of grotesque dehumanization that causes further extremism and political alienation. The same is true of pro-abortion individuals who show up with signs saying \u201cI love killing babies,\u201d and what not, with anti-abortion individuals harassing women seeking the service. It shifts the conversation from reasonable and nuanced to abhorrent nonsense. \n\nAnd sure, I can agree that unwanted pregnancies are in part a larger issue. Some of it is the hyper-sexualization of our culture. Some of it is the very good thing of promoting the idea that women can have careers and don\u2019t have to have children, because that in part does split up a traditional marriage and family dynamic and perhaps lead to out of wedlock pregnancies. Some of it is lack of proper sex education. I\u2019m skeptical that a lot of it is lack of available contraceptives, because they\u2019re really everywhere now, but it probably still plays a role too.\n\nIt\u2019s not a bad argument based on where it starts, though. Individuals in America have as much sexual freedom and education and preventative measures today as they ever have had throughout history. The concept of pregnancy being a serious issue in a multifaceted manner has been popularized in all sorts of media for ages. Kanye West: \u201cshe got one of your kids, she got you for 18 years.\u201d The movie Juno, the Twilight books deal in some capacity with a teenage pregnancy, (romanticizing it a bit, honestly) and I could go on and on and on with much older examples. To say that the average person doesn\u2019t understand the risks of pregnancy might be true in a limited capacity, but no doubt is it true that growing up almost everyone knew that a pregnancy is a big deal, even if they didn\u2019t know *just how much.*\n\nAnd there\u2019s a valid argument as well that the issue of even considering a pregnancy a failure in the first place is going about things the wrong way. Scorning teenage pregnancy as a societal norm isn\u2019t a good thing, especially when it\u2019s the case that they were safe, even if not abstinent. Why isn\u2019t it more promoted that creating life is a good thing, that sex with a stable and loving partner in marriage and family is rewarding and filling? There\u2019s a staple joke that individuals are often uncertain of whether to say \u201coh shit!\u201d or \u201ccongratulations!\u201d when a friend informs you of their pregnancy. \n\nAlso, I would be *very* careful on making the argument that we have strong biological urges that just sometimes *have* to be satisfied with the specific act of sexual intercourse, because that argument is the same basic premise that\u2019s used to excuse rape. I definitely don\u2019t think that you\u2019re acting in bad faith when bringing up the biological factors that do undoubtedly play a role, but to suggest that the only way to satisfy those urges is sexual intercourse and that a natural byproduct of that is the termination of a potential life is an absurdly extreme stance.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you don\u2019t see the connection to the willingness to engage in sexual intercourse with bodily autonomy. If the argument is \u201cwomen have the bodily autonomy to choose abortion,\u201d the natural point before it is to point out their autonomy in choosing to have sex under the presumed knowledge of what it results in, and as such that creates the moral necessity for early terminations. \n\nNot only that, but again, it\u2019s still not solely an issue of bodily autonomy, because it takes two to tango, the fetus is not the person\u2019s own body, it was not placed there in most cases by a hostile actor, in most cases it also poses no substantial risk to the carrier, and parental rights forfeiture is a thing.",

In effect potentially ruling you still have the right to that privacy...just you can't actually exercise it.\n\nAnd on a side note regarding your comment implying state's rights:  In 1819 SCOTUS ruled (having had access to the \"founders\" and their feedback on constitutional intent) that the allowed functions of the federal government were not all enumerated in the Constitution--that to enumerate all the privileges and functions which the federal government could do would make the constitution so onerous as to be unworkable.  \n\nIn effect, the whole notion of \"Strict Construction\" which keeps coming up in right wing and libertarian circles was tossed out the window long ago and has NEVER been true.  Not being specifically called out in the constitution **does NOT** mean it isn't a legitimate function of the federal government.  The 10th amendment is not near as limiting as is often claimed.",
