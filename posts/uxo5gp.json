You have the illusion of choice, but really it's just two parties who are aligned on about 90% of policy. They are very different rhetorically, but when it comes down to it both parties support endless wars and interference in other nations, neither is doing anything about student debt (though the Democrats love to campaign on it), and any progressive policies (such as reforming healthcare) that are brought up while the Democrats control the government are conveniently blocked by one member.\n\nThe most generous reading of the situation is that the Democrats are unable to get anything done. A more realistic reading is that the party have no intention of getting anything done.\n\nCase in point, if Biden really cares as much as he claims then he can issue some kind of executive order or memorandum to change things. It would be tricky to avoid contradicting federal law, but he's got an army of lawyers to help so that's no excuse. At the very least that will get Congress discussing the issue to determine whether the order should be overturned or not.\n\nSimilarly, he could issue an order on abortion to protect the legal right, or one protecting unions. He could raise the federal minimum wage. He could even issue an order on providing access to healthcare.\n\nSo where is the action to back up these rhetorical claims?",

What you are doing here is defending them against valid criticism because they are less evil.\n\n>Biden has issued 89 executive orders. As we have seen, though, executive orders can be reversed ny rhe next President.\n\nYes they can. Is that a reason not to do it though? I mean Biden is literally saying \"we have to act\" when he has the power to act and is not using it.\n\n>Congress does nothing because the 50 Republicans in the Senate want it to do nothing. They're not going to be shamed into doing anything.\n\nMore lame excuses. Congress can still bring legislation up and send it to the Senate even if it won't pass. That forces the Republicans to use the filibuster to publicly refuse to allow the legislation to be voted on. They won't be shamed into doing anything, but the Democrats can then campaign on the Republicans being anti-democratic at the cost of the lives of American children.\n\nThe catch being that if they do so, then they need to be democratic themselves.\n\n>Bided has issued an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors. However, we're not a monarchy so there are limits to what you can do. Which you want, because all of that can be undone.\n\nBiden has raised wages for federal workers specifically, but he has not issued an order to raise the federal minimum wage. Why not?\n\nHe hasn't issued an order protecting unions. Why not?\n\nHe hasn't issued an order strengthening gun control. Why not?\n\nHe hasn't issued an order protecting abortion rights. Why not?\n\nIf these issues that the Democratic party campaign on again and again are so important to them, why haven't they changed anything now that they are in power?",

Poor people would need to take an entire day off of work, unpaid, just to travel and wait in line for hours at a crowded polling station.\nLast election there were even police that were stopping people from giving bottles of water to the people that had been waiting in line for hours.",

Some people believe their vote doesn\u2019t matter, and need to be shown how it does. Some people don\u2019t know who to vote for, and need to be shown the ideals and realities of each candidate in a way that\u2019s factual and easy enough for them to digest. Some people feel too distrustful of politicians, so need to be shown how to manage their distrust and speculate reasonably. Some people just don\u2019t care enough, so need to be convinced and motivated by information that\u2019s meaningful to them. The list goes on and gets more complex.\n\nAnd obviously all of that needs to happen with an eye to transparency and fact-based reasoning. It\u2019s a very difficult thing to achieve. And complicating it even more is the fact that, often, it best serves the self-concerned, wealthy elite, if fewer people vote, and if more people are misinformed or misled. If fewer people vote, the status quo is preserved, and the elite get to keep their power. If you ask me, that\u2019s why we\u2019ve made so little progress increasing voter uptake in countries all over the world since modern democracies came about.\n\nI\u2019d be interested to know what in particular discourages you from voting.",

Having more parties offers more choice and makes your vote be more precise and meaningfull. If you want to punish your gvt (or party of choice) for making bad decisions in America, you have to vote the opposite of what you believe in/ voted for before.",

Under multiple Democratic majorities, it never was. People who believed in abortion rights got out and voted for politicians they believed would fight for that, and those politicians won, and Roe v Wade wasn't codified into law. So I'm sorry, but I cannot be convinced they are looking out for their voters. No matter who is in control, we keep moving further right and voting hasn't proven to be incredibly useful, but I will continue to vote, mainly because I would be a hypocrite complaining while not doing at least the bare minimum of my civic duty.\n\nSorry if this comes across as overly cynical. I have voted in the last 5 presidential elections and many more local and it is just exhausting watching everything steadily move in the direction it has been. Republicans are the only party that actually know how to wield power and that is depressing.",

This is not about some \"well actually\" technicality but about the Democrats learned helplessness when faced with any issue that the Republicans (don't) like (depending on which side of the argument the Ds or Rs are). \n\nSo bravo to you for knowing that the president doesn't sprinkle magic pixie dust on documents to make them US laws but if you think that's the issue at hand then you are not seeing the wider picture for the singular opportunity to dunk on some randos exasperated comment on the situation.",

Let\u2019s be real the villain in the healthcare issue is the insurance companies though, Obamacare just made their villainy more profitable.\n\nThe student debt issue I would also lay at the feet of democrats. When the government took control of the student loan business is when this \u201ccrisis\u201d began. It essentially nullified your ability to shop around for the best loan and universities discovered they could charge whatever they wanted and the government would still give kids the loan.\n\nI have no love for the GOP either, especially Trump.

I\u2019m curious as to why that is.\n\nTo be honest I\u2019m not gonna sit here and tell you that the US is perfect, it isn\u2019t. But there isn\u2019t anywhere else that I\u2019d rather live.",

The punishment for brandishing one in public will also have to be severe. \n\nYour post, while technically correct, is playing semantics. One branch of government can do this.

One is that an amendment is proposed in congress, which would have to win 75% of both houses. The other is called a constitutional convention in which the 75% of the states must ratify it.

One expanded relaxed WIC rules and gave the USDA expanded tools to manage supply shortages. It passed with 414 votes in the House and unanimous consent in the Senate. It was signed into law on Monday. The other is a one paragraph bill that authorizes $28m for the FDA to \u201caddress the current shortage\u201d. It\u2019s unclear how or when that money and the FDA would have an impact on anything. The money wouldn\u2019t go to families, wouldn\u2019t buy formula to give away, and wouldn\u2019t alter the WIC program. The immediate impact of relaxing WIC rules to expand the program to other product was passed with huge bipartisan support and is now a law.",

These rules were set up in a time of reason by people who were held to a standard of rationality. Even then though, they knew that 'mob rules' would some day come back to bite them. In my opinion, it was one of their greatest fears. This is why the president is SUPPOSED to have very little power. It's why the Senate was established in case the Representatives stopped looking out for national interests as opposed to their own local interest.",

The problem here is that there's no clear political move to take forward now. Banning bump stocks was an easy win. It was right after the Las Vegas massacre, everyone knew the shooter had used them, and *some* understood how much more destructive they allowed him to be. It was enough that even the GOP wouldn't make a huge stink about a ban. \n\nNow? What's the actionable route? He can't just ban guns, that would take a repeal of a constitutional amendment. Maybe you're thinking, why not just assault rifles? Unfortunately, there's not a clear definition of what an assault rifle is, and aside from the fact that any law banning something should be extremely explicit, the GOP would use the murkiness of that definition to their advantage, and the bill would either never pass or be riddled with loopholes.\n\nThe only compromise I could see happening is tightening the requirements to own a gun, and that's such a shitshow I won't even go into it.",

It's possible to repeal an amendment, but it's only happened once in nearly 250 years, and that was to end Prohibition. Because that right is guaranteed in the Constitution, a repeal would have to be approved by 2/3 of the House and Senate, as well as 3/4 of the states, which is obviously a huge majority. Alternatively, I believe the Supreme Court could theoretically rule that the \"arms\" we have the right to bear don't explicitly include modern firearms, as their destructive capabilities are orders of magnitudes higher than the capabilities of the firearms that existed back then. I don't think either of those scenarios are likely to happen in my lifetime with the courts and state level politics as they currently are.",

It seems the real power lies with the senate, and Presidents are just used by each party to get as many of their own into power as possible. \n\nBut if the President DOES actually hold any real authority, surely they can't be trusted to use it because it's perfectly legal for large corporations to donate millions of dollars to them in return for passing laws which are beneficial to them at the detriment of the average voter. \n\nYes, yes, well done Biden for publicly and heroically pronouncing that the collective \"we\" need to stand up to the NRA, you vague-talking dinosaur. But those words mean nothing if he can't do anything about it. It's just a \"damned if you don't\" situation. He says it, can't follow through on actions. He doesn't say it, his voters hold him accountable (as much as a US President can be held responsible). He really didn't have a choice so the words ring a little hollow.",

The President's executive branch people can work with members of Congress to draft legislation but the President doesn't introduce legislation or vote on it. \n\nBiden is using his position as President to publicly call on the Congress to do something about it, fully knowing that Republican congressional leadership will only respond with something stupid such as requiring that all Americans carry two guns in both hands at all times (/s).",

Sure, it's difficult to come out to people, you're afraid of what they'll think, but once you do, you'll have an immense sense of relief and freedom. Or don't come out if you're not ready, that's fine too. But I'm sad that you don't even seem to have come out to *yourself* yet. This weird habit of yours of steering any unrelated conversation into your own *highly specific* homoerotic fantasies? That's not something that straight people do. It's actually a really common tell-tale behavior of people that are struggling to comprehend their own desires and orientation. It's a defense mechanism of a mind fighting against itself and losing. In extreme cases, the person will turn to homophobia or even violence against gays. \n\nDon't do that. It's really easy to find a guy that's into the exact same thing you're fantasizing about. You can find someone who will act out everything that you've breathlessly described in this thread. \n\nYou don't have to fight yourself, you can actually have exactly what you want.

They do not hold the majority in the Senate unless they actually achieve a tie which is currently impossible due to 2 of the 50 Dem senators constantly siding with the Republicans. So no, the Democrats do not have full control. Currently everything dies in the Senate.\n\nI know you probably mistakenly left out the Judicial Branch not knowing it was the third branch, but the Dems overwhelmingly now have no pull there either with a 6-3 Republican majority.",

But then demographics shifted, technology changed and the founding documents started to be treated as sacred texts not changeable law (see: [American Civil Religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_civil_religion)). It's telling that there were 11th amendments in the first decade after the Constitution came into effect, but the only amendment of the past 50 years was a bookkeeping exercise around lawmaker salaries.\n\nSo the issue is not the government per se, but the government refusing to evolve with the times. This is mostly due to excessive authority of a minority of states and lawmakers who benefit from the stale status quo.",

              "text": "Look, I get everyone is in here with their highschool civics education saying \"Lol, POTUS doesn't make laws!\" And that's true, but only at that surface level. The President is probably the least powerless person* when it comes to policy changes. He's not all powerful, but the power he has is significant. First, he's president. He can issue a variety of executive orders, which is where most changes in governance have come from in the last several decades because our government is breaking down as institutions degrade and previously binding traditions are relegated obsolete, mostly by one party seizing power how and where they can... but I digress. Yes, executive orders are easy to overturn and subject to judicial challenge but they have the potential to be effective in the short term, as well as hamstring incoming executives from the other party if you want to go that route (see Trump).\n\nBut that's not all! The president is *also* the head of his respective party. A party that currently has a majority in both legislative bodies. I know, I know - Manchin and Sinema - members of the party that don't toe the party line. I get the frustration, but to me that seems like a problem the head of the party should work out. It's one that cuts both ways too - Paul is a headache for the GOP, although they seem to have him mostly handled, and McCain did cost them overturning Obamacare on his deathbed. I don't honestly know how to handle this problem, particularly given our unrepresentative Constitution that gives far more representation in the Senate to essentially Rotten Boroughs like Wyoming and the other low population states. \n\nOh, and there's also the fillibuster. See the note in the first paragraph for nonbinding traditions to see how this will be dealt with at some point. Probably not by the Democrats. Things like this are where I think most people's frustration comes from - they see the GOP willing to use do whatever is necessary to seize and maintain power, which no one likes, but by refusing to play the same game the Democrats are hamstringing themselves.\n\nThen, of course, there's the Bully Pulpit. You've no doubt heard of this one in relation to the Roosevelts, but I'd argue Trump is an even better example. The President has the biggest megaphone in the country - what he says *is* news. He could use it to name and shame those who stand in the way of issues he finds important, and even if that doesn't sway them it shifts blame in the public's eyes. This clearly isn't Biden's strong suit, but he's the one who ran for the job so I'd like to suggest he suck it up and learn.\n\n* Now the caveats - there are people potentially more powerful than POTUS: those 9 unelected geriatrics on the Supreme Court who serve for life and say what can and can't be a law. Their role is reactive, but more final. I'd argue that if we want to have an actual representative government it should be done away with entirely.",

All the guy was saying is that the \u201cwe\u201d Biden is talking about should be the literal president of the United States and the countless political and corporate connections Biden has formed over his decades as a politician, not the randos that follow him on Twitter. \n\nEvery person I see in this comment section doesn\u2019t seem to realize that powerful people love to push responsibility onto everyone\u2019s plate but their own even when they are the best equipped to deal with whatever issue they\u2019re pretending to be upset about. \n\nThe President of the United States does not have the power to unilaterally write laws but he most certainly has the political influence to control those who do. He just doesn\u2019t care and is hoping another black guy gets shot or Roe V. Wade is officially overturned so he can pretend to be outraged about that new tragedy and the next one and the next one until finally he\u2019s been re-elected and can stop pretending to give a fuck about the average American citizen. \n\nThe President of the United States does not have absolute power based on his title alone but his numerous connections give him all the power that his title doesn\u2019t grant him.",

Pack the courts so that you have a progressive court that doesn't just rely on fucking original interpretations of the second amendment to not ban assault rifles and mags built for warzones. \n\nSecondly, Go after the NRA. I doubt those fuckers are clean. Start investigating them. Look at their funding. Their involvements with elected officials. You're telling me you won't find something to fuck with them? Without that money, you'll see host of congressman/senators act all quiet. \n\nThirdly, if this is as big as a tragedy you think it is. Use your emergency powers to ban the sale of these automatic weaponry for 6 months/year. Get the guns off the streets. Even for a little while, the leadership in the house can figure out how best to tackle it. Make your intent clear.",

Congress **can** override Presidential veto, but it isn't super common. His power to introduce laws is nil, as it should be.
