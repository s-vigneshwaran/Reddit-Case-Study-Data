For 2 years I felt like a lost chick who broke up w their love, so weird I know, but our bond was rooted since we were 12 years old. He was supposed to the best man at my wedding and if ended up not even inviting him, I regret that a bit but it was more painful to see him in the crowd instead of by my side as we had planned for years. Anyways, your situation sounds less like a drift apart and more like an obstacle, I think he\u2019ll see the light eventually.",

One guy gets a girlfriend who seems a bit controlling. She tolerates us for a while, but is vocal to him about her dislike for our lifestyles and our \u2018influence\u2019 on him. We didn\u2019t do shit except for go out and drink (sometimes a bit too much) after work, but this bitch was cancer.\n\nDude is all in on this chick, and all of a sudden he\u2019s gone. Can\u2019t come out, can\u2019t have us over, can\u2019t swing by for a drink after work, just gone. \n\n6 months or so go by, and out of nowhere his girlfriends mom gets really sick; In the hospital with sepsis from some dental infection and is in legit danger of dying. Our buddy\u2019s girl didn\u2019t have any real friends (shocking) and didn\u2019t have anyone to help her out while she traveled to be with her mom. \n\nOur buddy called us and told us about the situation, and even though we were all pissed of at him, and especially her, we all helped out. For the 2 months she was on the east coast we took turns going to her place and fed her cats, we took care of her mail, we even covered her rent for a month (this was before internet rent payment was a thing). \n\nWhen the whole saga was over (her mom lived thankfully) and my friend fully explained to her what *his* buddies did, even though it wasn\u2019t for her, it was for *him*, she absolutely 100% changed her entire fucking personality. Not even faking it\u2026 she genuinely realized what friends are.\n\nSince this she\u2019s been a bridesmaid at two of our group\u2019s weddings, including my own, and she\u2019s probably the one who tries to get us all together the most. \n\nKeep faith in your buddy",
