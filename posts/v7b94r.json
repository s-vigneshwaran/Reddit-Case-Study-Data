Oh maillions are not hooked in... Oops. Let me just... Sort that out. Ah there we go, hooked in and getting on the speed bar aaaaand I'm behind the ridge in the wind shadow now fuck.

Not shredded or anything but decently lean and def not a dad bod. Cutting out grains/cereal for breakfast was probably the single biggest difference maker for me, I have way more stable energy throughout the day and it even cured a lot of heartburn/reflux problems I'd had since I was a kid.",

Drink milk at the gym instead of water (I usually drank chocolate).  Don't drink water at all unless it's hot out and you already finished your milk.\n\nThe 6000 calorie days were kind of a regret, I wouldn't do those regularly, but one day I remember getting a couple double whopper meals from burger king with fries and diet coke, I think 10-20 chicken nuggets and then went to the pub later and had 10-20 wings and a couple beers, maybe a gallon of milk on top of that?  I'm not really sure, I just remember it ended up being 6000 calories.  Probably couldn't do that multiple days in a row.",

Never get into a deal where one partner benefits from breaking it. \n\nMarriage isn\u2019t failing because of me, I noticed something was wrong before the internet took off, I\u2019ve never seen a married couple that wasn\u2019t bitter and pretended they could\u2019ve done better. I\u2019ve noticed boomer fathers were more deadbeat ish in marriages that ended in divorce. In gen x Ive heard they\u2019re much better with the kids. \n\nMedia has gotten in womens ear that they can do better once divorced. But of course, it must be younger incels that are the problem, instead of a symptom.",

Why would you want a sexual partner who is less capable? My guess would be comfort. Easier emotional connections. People perceive muscular guys to be less emotional, less complacent, more aggressive, harder to control etc. I wonder, given different circumstances how this trend would change. For example, would a women who is in some tribe in Africa prefer a muscular guy to a dad bod? I guarantee it. For the same reason, comfort, but in her particular situation. I would also theorize that it comes from situations as a child. What you learned to value in a male based on what you were lacking or something you experienced that left an impression; be it good or bad.",
