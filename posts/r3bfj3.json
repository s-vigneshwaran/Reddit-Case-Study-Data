I just think it would make for more productive discourse if people had an honest discussion about the implications.\n\nPeople asserted that the business will not be covered by insurance for damage caused by civil unrest. They also implied that the revenue lost during recovery from the damage would not covered. The provided link shows that both of those things are not true. There is plenty of variability across policies and providers, so there are probably *some* scenarios where that could be the case, but to make a bold general claim that business will not be covered by damage or lost income as a result of civil unrest is demonstrably false. Factually incorrect arguments aren't a great way to get your point across.\n\nAre insurance deductables an unfair burden on business owners impacted by riot damage? Yes, absolutely. Is the process of filing an insurance claim a major disruption and a distressing situation? Yes, absolutely. Is it upsetting for people to watch the destruction of the businesses they devote their lives to? Yes, absolutely. There are very compelling reasons why it is wrong for these businesses to have been destroyed. False statements and hyperbole, such as \"these businesses won't be covered by insurance\" aren't as compelling.",

It drives me nuts when some ignorant fool says \u201cthey have insurance, they\u2019ll be okay!\u201d  Even if we excluded any of the crazy exceptions various insurances have, be it company or state regulated, they don\u2019t cover downtime. With a chain of damaged businesses, it could take weeks or months before repairs and reimbursement occurs. Very few, if any would cover that waiting time. Employees cant draw work hours, and any clients will go elsewhere since said business is down. What good is 100k in damages worth if it destroys your contracts, clients, and workforce? \n\nOur state has a lot of tornadoes and wind damage. Insurance companies here will often pay for property damages but it can take all year before repairs are done. Many businesses have to depend on their nest eggs just to survive but more often by the time they get paid and/or get repairs, its too late.  It\u2019s not the insurance company\u2019s fault, and they cover what they can, but hypothetical income is extremely hard to pay out. Some companies attempt to cover loss of income by using an average of previous income but it almost always comes too late. More successful small businesses that are contract and client dependent almost always lose their work to competitors and employees go elsewhere to survive and pay bills. \n\nHonestly I think those who damage during riots should get the absolute worst punishment. Not saying massive prison time, but a sentence that is insanely costly. You want to destroy people\u2019s business and property, then you forfeit any success of your own. You can be pissed off at a law, policy, corruption, etc., but you don\u2019t take it out on random people. The argument of nothing changing doesn\u2019t mean screwing over other people because you NEVER get what you want, you just make even more people miserable and you make more enemies and STILL haven\u2019t fixed your problem. We need more Roof Koreans. People say its not worth taking a life over property, well its also not worth risking your life to destroy/loot someone else\u2019s property. I don\u2019t condone killing, but I also don\u2019t sympathize for anyone who loses their life rioting/looting.",

Now ideally one should be able to say that someone who kills a criminal in \"self defense\" should be able to rely upon a jury of their peers to see the evidence of such and let them go about their life. Unfortunately we've repeatedly seen that such systems do not work with an even vaguely acceptable degree of consistency. Fair enough, unjustified killings are more the domain of law enforcement than that of the average citizen, but it's still a shitshow.\n\nAnd again, the example you give is such an extreme one that it puts the means to stop the rampage well out of the reach of the average citizen (and even the police). I can't think of many ways a single person can cause so much damage without also putting themselves in such a situation. Shawn Nelson would be another such example. So unless you believe the average citizen should have access to antitank weapons, the idea of someone being able to stop a rampage which threatens an entire community is just silly.",

You accept its reasonable to use deadly force in self defense but aren't for the death penalty in all attempted murders then i would similarly just ask the same question to clarify the distinction. Explain how someone killing someone else in reasonable self defense is any less dead than the state executing them for assault with a deadly weapon.\n\nThe purpose if the tank hypothetical is to be extreme to see if you really do believe defending property is never justified to use deadly force. There shouldnt be an issue saying \u201cok yes that is justified, so there is some line between destroying a town and stealing a quarter where deadly force becomes justified.\u201d Its doesnt make me win the argument but it then gets rid of the blanket \u201cproperty>life, never kill to protect property\u201d argument into something practical and reasonable.\n\nTo me that line is obviously crossed when someone is destroying your home and you cant get them stop, if you reasonably escalate force to protect your home and they never stop, eventually deadly force will become justified. Me not supporting the death penalty has nothing to do with it just as your acceptance of killing someone in self defense has nothing to do with your support for the death penalty.

I don\u2019t ever want someone to get shot but like I already said\u2026when you or anyone chooses to be an aggressor of violent action they already created the situation. Don\u2019t get mad at people who aren\u2019t going to stand by and accept it. There are many videos of the blm protests and riots going into homes and violating peoples spaces. When you want to avoid a problem you take it out at the root cause. The root cause being these people gathering and rioting. You don\u2019t allow the root cause of a problem to grow. Any logical person will tell you this. This doesn\u2019t change because a topic is different. I do agree that we have laws in place and these laws should be adhered to. That begins with not starting riots, attacking people, burning down buildings. Cops can only do so much especially in these idiot cities that want to defund and already terribly funded police force. The less police that show up the more the people will show up. The sense of community and family will always trump terrorists wanting to destroy. I understand your thinking, where you are messing up is where your thinking starts. Root cause my friend.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sure releasing thousands of violent criminals early last year from jails and prisons in democrat cities was a sign to tell rioters to go home. I\u2019m sure celebrities and athletes bailing these rioters out of jail sent the message to go home. Media downplaying riots as peaceful protests sent the message of go home. I\u2019m glad apparently YOU tell them but the large majority are not. They embrace the chaos then cry about outcomes like a pedophile trying to kill someone getting killed.",

I hope he rolls up\n\nYour comment starts with the character assassination of rittenhouse for shooting people who were physically attacking him. Accuse the jury of being fixed because rittenhouse, like all others, was allowed to legally defend himself from people attacking him and the outcome did not go your way so you throw a temper tantrum.\n\nYou then finish your statement with a clear reflection that this man is in pain due to rioters and looters destroying what he worked hard for, the same thing those rioters and looters were doing in Kenosha.\n\nYou then add the cherry on top with a statement that you hope he rolls up, which, where I am from means you hope he takes revenge on those who wronged him, so you are advocating for him to defend his business, his livelihood and his possessions with premeditated after the fact killings. But Rittenhouse is a bad person for killing someone who is actively attacking him and endangering his life.\n\nI think you are confused and letting your hatred for a person, almost certainly built based upon false information, force you into a position where you are justifying killing over property and condemning self defense of life.\n\nYou may want to take a social media break.",

I simply stated that Trump is an asshole not to realize that shitty bloated lifestyle, being hugely hideously obese. It\u2019s going to catch up with him. And the fact that nobody knows he\u2019s 78 years old well, I guess it\u2019s because his minions are too stupid to do math. As far as him shitting himself daily why don\u2019t you Google Trump shit himself daily. I\u2019ve seen posts from people who were on the apprentice with him 10 years ago that said that they had to stop filming because had explosive diarrhea. He\u2019s so lazy he has people who are paid to clean his ass. He doesn\u2019t even clean himself out of common decency for himself. That\u2019s how entitled that some bitch is. Just because you don\u2019t want to know doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t true. Could you imagine the size diapers that fat ass needs. Could you imagine how low you have to be to take that job cleaning that filthy hog. Well it\u2019s a good example of his minions: lick any shit, clean any shit as long as it\u2019s trumps. He\u2019s shits or because of his drug use. Which you also want to deny. PeriodAnd I apologize about getting a little Kyle baby his age wrong. So he was 17 wow 24 months difference in a murderer. Wow so he held off two more years before he killed someone deliberately. Because that\u2019s why he had the gun asshole. That\u2019s why he brought The gun. To use it. It\u2019s why some people become cops, to murder. I\u2019m a realist and Trump and Rittenhouse are not infallible. They can\u2019t control everything even though they think they can. Juries  can be bought But justice brought on by your own entitlement does happen. I don\u2019t wish people dead. I only wish that they would wake up and stop being monsters.

Unless you want to justify police shooting armed BIPOC on sight and using that excuse, which I don't think you do. \n\nSecondly, there is no evidence prior to the evening of him ever having been a member of the proud boys or any other organizations, other than the ones he discussed that were ran by the state public service agencies. \n\nThirdly, you are applying an intent where none existed. If his intent was to go there looking for trouble then it does not explain his clean up of graffiti during the day and his administration of 1st aid to protestors and counter-protestors alike that evening. It also does not explain why he is on video multiple times trying to de-escalate multiple tense situations and why when chased by people he ran to get away from them rather than simply firing at them on the spot. \n\nBut you say they were defending themselves. Possible. Sure. They could claim self defense. \n\nBut let's assume they lived. \n\nThey are on the stand, they claim self defense. \n\n\"So to be clear, you saw Mr rittenhouse, with his weapon pointed at the ground, running towards the obvious line of police two blocks away, and it was at that point you felt he was enough of a threat to your life that you actively engaged him by chasing him, knocking him to the ground and trying to cave in his skull with a skateboard. Can you please explain to the court how you felt that a person running away from you, not actively firing, was a danger to your life?\" \n\nThat is how it would go. \n\nThe protestors would 100% be within their rights to defend themselves if they could articulate a reasonable belief, based upon facts, that their lives were in immediate danger from Rittenhouse. \n\nHowever, based on the available video evidence, that simply is not the case. \n\nWhat we do see is Rittenhouse shoot the first guy who chased him down, then we see him run back to him, a mob forms screaming to get him and kill him so he again runs, he is assaulted, people who were  kt at the scene of the first shooting hear via shouting that he shot someone and to get him and kill him, and they follow the mob violence and try to do exactly that. \n\nThe simple fact is, that those who were shot had absolutely zero chance of being shot had they not actively engaged in assaulting a person who was armed. \n\n>\n>Dude showed up at a riot hoping he had a chance to shoot someone. It\u2019s a fantasy of these freaks.\n\nBased on what evidence do you make this claim?\n\nCite your sources, show your work, or at least admit that you just don't like him and don't care about the evidence, I can at least respect that honesty, if not being able to respect you for it.",

But it may be up to the individual business owners to decide how much insurance they want to buy to cover their inventory and equipment in case of theft, fire and other scenarios.\n\nLarge chains such as Target, Starbucks and Apple use their deep pockets to buy sophisticated policies that cover the entire chain for losses stretching into the millions of dollars, according to Janet Ruiz, director of strategic communication at the Insurance Information Institute.\n\nBut for smaller businesses, the amount of coverage can vary widely in terms of deductibles and dollar limits, depending on the type of business, the value of the inventory and the depth of an owner\u2019s pockets. Since not all landlords require businesses to insure their inventory and equipment against loss, some local owners will end up having to cover all of the losses and repair costs on their own.",

Posts have trended well with launch of his products (John Wick, Cyberpunk, etc).\n\n2. The hate for Jeff Bezos. Even though there are far worse billionaires (pedophiles, people who have caused irreparable environmental damage etc), Bezod has specifically been targeted across social media. The rise of this sentiment aligns heavily with his 'feud' with the Saudi family. Eg when the Bezos-owned newspaper (Washington Post) criticized the Saudi government for  murdering one of its journalists and Bezos was hacked.\n\nDon't believe anything you hear from strangers on reddit, even if there are multiple that share the same view. It's too damn east to astroturf in the world of social media.",

Accordingly, Tony D. Sampson defines viral phenomena as spreadable accumulations of events, objects, and affects that are overall content built up by popular discourses surrounding network culture.[2]:\u200a22\u200a There is also a relationship to the biological notion of disease spread and epidemiology. In this context, \"going viral\" is similar to an epidemic spread, which occurs if more than one person is infected by a disease for every person infected. Thus, if a piece of content is shared with more than one person every time it is seen, then this will result in viral growth.[6]\n\nYou're holding on to this VERY SPECIFIC AND SMALL subset that is video, and asserting that things couldn't \"go viral\" prior to YouTube and you're just being a moron.",

People that weren\u2019t old enough or born in 1992 see very little difference in what I\u2019m talking about, but if you were old enough to watch this video when it happened, nobody ever said it went viral back then.\n\nBy that same logic you could say the verdict of the Ahmaud Arbery trial \u201cwent viral\u201d when in fact it was just a popular topic covered by a lot of news networks. That\u2019s why it was on a bunch of networks and probably seen all over the world.

To my original point- this is what we called \u201cnews\u201d in 1992.\n\nSome people think this is semantics, but fail to recognize that in today\u2019s world, viral videos get covered by the media, and sometimes they don\u2019t; however, in 1992, clips like this were absolutely put onto television by large media companies to encourage a narrative. People did not have control over this issues. Again, viral marketing saw people buying products or spreadi g word of mouth as consumers. Simple conceptual events like this one only \u201cwent viral\u201d(using the term or not) if the powers at be felt it could make them money.\n\nNobody set out to make money off \u201cCharlie bit my finger\u201d, it just spread as a viral video because we have more control over cultural memes and values.",

The entire premise of \u201cgoing viral\u201d relies on the fact that at some point in history, millions and millions of more people owned devices, and high-speed Internet, in order to spread videos at \u201cviral\u201c speed.\n\nI just don\u2019t know how else to say this.

Something can go viral purely by word of mouth. With land line phones alone an entire country can know about something within minutes. I replied to your original comment using 9/11 as an example but you can go further back in history to the times of ww2 and see the exact same behavior. Whenever there was major news the entire country knew about it EXTREMELY quickly. \n\nI agree with you that a \"viral\" spread of information occurs when each individual in the chain passes information along, and that it spreads quickly. What I disagree with you on is that it must involve \"high speed internet\" and \"digital video\". There is no fundamental difference between communicating via high speed internet, or via a land line. The transmission of information from one individual to other individuals rapdily and widely is all that defines a \"viral\" spread.",

And you could argue the distinction of sending a link that allows you to watch a video instantly versus communicating the story and knowledge of the video to other people who would then watch it when there was an opportunity.\n\nAlthough there were fewer people using it in 1992, the internet existed and email was a thing. \n\nThe bottom line is you are creating a definition of \"viral\" that aligns with your point, but language doesn't work like that. It was understood what the OP meant. You can debate whether it is appropriate usage on the historical accuracy of whether there was significant distribution of this particular story through  community spread, or if people just got the information directly from a major news source. \n\nEither could be true, but it doesn't change the fact that viral spread of information applies to the pre YouTube world.\n\nSource: was alive before YouTube and learned things by talking to people. For example, I learned 9/11 was happening from other people, and I called other people who learned it from me. Then we turned on the TVs and radios.\n\nIt didn't take long for a lot of people that would not have normally been watching the news mid day on a weekday to hear about what was happening.",

Literally everyone in the country knew about that within an hour and it's because people were sharing the news with other people. The mechanisms by which they shared were different, but conceptually it's exactly the same. Anything that is shared between people is an example of something that \"went viral\".\n\nAs for the term \"widely spread\" that can occur without any individual person sharing with any other individual person. It can just be plastered all over the media and be considered \"widely spread\" same as when movies are released you can have a \"wide release\" or a \"limited release\".",

So when people saw that the LAPD was going to get away with something that was ON TAPE (because back then almost nothing was caught on tape because people didn't walk around with expensive video cameras), they flipped out and said, \"OK, we get it, its the hard way then.\" \n\nIf you can't trust the justice system to take care of this, you can't trust them to take care of anything at all.

All the tech was there, you just had to KNOW how to utilize it. \n\nYou have to think, you could install windows 95 from 13 floppy disks, it would have been 15, but they had a special format on them.. so the TOTAL installer was less than 21.6 Mb for the whole OS\u2026 files were a LOT smaller back then.

I may be mistaken, but I think they have now only been surpassed by the recent George Flloyd riots. \n\nWhile many businesses were insured and many claims were filed, many businesses didn't and if they did, were underinsured. On top of which, many insurance companiens never paid out. NY Times even wrote pieces titled \"Did Insurers Abandon the Inner City?\".\n\nLong story short, the majority of black and inner city business owners that had their businesses robbed, burned, or destroyed had everything taken from them and never recovered.\n\nNot to mention, even if you have insurance, it isn't sone magic wand that makes everything go back to how it was or means your business can re open. It helps to mitigate and recover costs, but if your entire building is burned down, you suddenly have no way of making money and that pesky thing called time gets in the way.",

Within all that there are also opportunists and right wing agent provacateurs adding to the carnage.\n\nOne of my favorite things about conservatives is how we're all supposed to endure mass shooters in kindergardens as a neccessary byproduct of 2a rights but to those same people when some property gets destroyed as a byproduct of 1st amendment rights then that's just simply unacceptable and it's warranted to punish all of them for the sins of a few.\n\nIf you were just a little more consistent it would be easier to understand.\n\nOh, and fuck you too",

Your refusal to call these people out and distance them away from your movement will cause dwindling support to your cause. And don't you dare preach me any bs about them being so oppressed that this is the only way, there are so many movements going on in the world that turn into riots, but systematic looting of small businesses is an america only problem. Your support of this problem as a cry of oppression is helping it grow.\n\nEdit: also nowhere have i said i am conservative or that i support their causes and views on gun laws.

People rioting and looting aren't watching the news and staying politically engaged. They are just extremely poor, struggling to get by with limited job opportunites, transportation, food and dealing with an oppressive police presence all around them.\n\nThe activist BLM people who watch the news and would hear such a message are already just peacefully protesting, but are getting lumped in with the plain ol' non politically active citizens who are mainly in anguish and pissed off that another one of their own were senselessly murdered by police.\n\n They are extremely poor and don't have the means or transportation to go act out on a government building if it's not in their area. They are stuck where they are. However, I do believe the police stations and couthouses in the area are often targeted so they are attempting to direct their ire to some degree.\n\nLastly, I truly believe the main people who are doing the rioting and looting are not politically active at all nor do they give a shit about the victim du jour. They are criminals from the area, addicts, bangers, etc who see people marching in protest and they see an opportunity to get some free shit and start some fires. They are beyond giving a fuck about anything or everyone. They don't vote.\n\nThere are also well documented cases of BLM's opponents from both the police and populace posing as protestors and either joining in or outright initiating violent acts. \n\nThere are also white boy anarchist types who think Bernie Sanders is too conservative and would't hear BLM leadership either. When I watched the BLM riots the majority of people getting violent seemed to actually be these types. Dudes with skateboards. Punks.\n\nSo it's a chaotic situation made up of a complex mix of types of people. Directing a riot is about as impossible as herding cats. It's like a Hurricane or other natural phenomenon that occurs under specific circumstances.\n\nThat's why my solution is tackling the root causes aggressively and to do something about changing those circumstances. \n\nGet rid of the segregation of the extreme poor with more section 8 housing and subsidies that get them spread ouf and into better neighborhoods where better job opportunities exist. Get them good counselors who will help them transition. This costs money but we are the world's richest nation. We can afford the investment that is guaranteed to pay dividends in the immense cost savings it would lead to.\n\nProvide more funds to training programs directed at those on the bottom rung and provide well thought incentives to get them up that ladder and off of government assistance. \n\nReform the police and provide more refined and varied tools for dealing with problems rather than seeing only nails needing hammering.\n\n Putting more resources into rescuing good people from poverty so that the real criminals can be isolated and then dealt with. However, with more opportunities I believe over time less of them will choose the criminal path to begin with.",

Google is right on your phone. \n\n> Almost all commercial property insurance policies provide coverage for riots, civil commotion, looting, and vandalism damage to a covered business location.\n\nPlus $1,000 to completely renovate the building, fix all damages, get all your contents replaced, etc? Not a bad deal. \n\nI work in disaster/ environmental restoration. We do property repairs after fires, floods, natural disasters, etc. We even did a store that got vandalized last summer during BLM. We\u2019ve seen this a decent amount and guess who pays for it all? The insurance companies. (Not to mention we reimburse the insured their deductible so at the end of the day they get a brand new property with all new things inside for $0.)\n\nBtw I\u2019m not saying this to be a jackass I\u2019m just saying if you can get your property and things replaced via insurance awesome. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for. We\u2019ve had clients who literally lost children and family members in fires. Tell me how\u2019re you replacing that with a thousand bucks? Buildings are just buildings and stuff is just stuff. If you get thru a disaster just losing some stuff and keeping your health and family: awesome. That\u2019s why you have property insurance.",

The WTC fought it and I believe they won, but most business aren\u2019t going to have the cash flow necessary after a riot to fight an insurance company in court.\n\nEven if all the stars align and the guy had the right type of insurance and was paying far more for beefier coverage is the hill you really want to die on that every small business owner should have been an expert on the type of insurance they would need for every eventuality?",

That's where mob mentality comes from. It doesn't matter what race, background, or experience you have, any group of people has the potential to do things outside the norm. \n\nNot to mention that a lot of times you have bad actors within these groups looking to cause trouble.",

Rather the death threats and cancel culture is to blame, which doesn\u2019t require people to even leave the house.\n\nMeanwhile, while we\u2019re on the topic of children being killed by political extremists, I would absolutely love to hear your take on the Waukesha parade, where a BLM activist killed dozens of people including a black 8 year old.",

Disingenuous doesn\u2019t even begin to describe these people. They attack those who challenge them with all their might, then leave when it turns into a conversation instead of a shitfest.

They are the reason we're intaking the very things that cause these incurable cancers. They are the reason we have to work until 60 while a senator can work 1 year and be set for life with 200k a year just for arguing about what to do with the money they took out of yours and my check then for it not to be available to me when I actually need it or something happens within the company and I lose a 401k and whatever else I had right b4 retiring then I have to work to 80 but my bones won't make it so I slaved for a system that doesn't help its ppl who are the very backbone of the country. Interesting word backbone, holds the entire body up. No idc about the bigger businesses who lie, cheat, and deceive their way to top and force you to live the way they want you to instead of the way you'd live if they never existed. No idc because they are whats wrong with my country  they are what's ruining my country. I do care when it's a person of humble means like the guy in the video who worked his entire life to get there. That's when it's wrong because he is just like them, fighting the struggle and never ending oppression to get where he is or was. \n\nNow saying all of that, I myself would never do that. I believe there are better/different ways to get our voices heard. Sometimes though, we need violence because sometimes that's only what ppl respond to",

But historically at best, they were too busy with their lives to fix a system that didn't work for black people.\n\nMaybe having a little historical perspective might help. Rodney King got his ass whipped by police for like 15 minutes while it was video taped. The case went to trial and every officer was acquitted. If we saw that same video today, they would have gone to jail. The racism in our justice system is pretty evidenced. Although, I don't condone the riots, its kind of dismissive to understand why it started in the first place. They didn't just wake up one day and riot.",

It's one thing to be violent in your disgust against those whom are somewhat related to your grievance. It's an entirely different level of wrong to blindly destroy things that aren't yours because you're upset at an unrelated issue.\n\nI then responded to you by reminding you that civil revolution isn't exactly \"American\". We live in a \\[great\\] country that is founded on the principle of violent revolt against those in power. So much so that the second amendment in our constitution guarantees the right of common people to own firearms as a means of violently reacting if those in power fail to execute their duties in the best interest of the nation.

Its existence is centered around the common people having the ability to forcibly remove/kill members of authority if those individuals act against the interests of the nation. It's such an important concept that it's been enshrined in our founding documents and upheld in court over and over and over.\n\nNot every cause deserves violent protest.

Did he mean, don't destroy his business, destroy only the stuff white people own? Or did he mean something else?\n\nMaybe the guy *did* mean \"only destroy the stuff white people own, leave black people alone\", I dunno, I don't know the guy or what he believes.

You said they acted irrationally. I agree not much has changed, certainly more than nothing, but not nearly enough. Guess what, violence hasn't actually made anything better, any more than peace. If we're measuring, MLK Jr. is typically recognized as the most influential figure in civil rights for black people, so peace has at least a slightly better track record.\n\nSo, yes, I understand the loss of patience. Whole generations have come and gone with little or no improvement to show for it. I get the violence. It's still not the right choice. It's still not productive. I can not condemn them, not judge them, but still offer constructive criticism. It's a luxury, this, to be able to discuss it from the sidelines. I'm not gonna pretend otherwise. But it's also important to remember that these people, the ones being violent, *don't* make up a majority, in any sense or in any jurisdiction. So the best thing we can do is offer constructive criticism from a place of understanding, because the alternative is to throw them in jail and ruin their lives.",

They are creating the distinction between human and animal in order to justify some treatment of the \"animal.\" In many cases, it's done in order to justify violence.\n\nIt's obvious to anyone that looting and rioting is bad, but comments like the one I initially responded to usually come from bad, racist, thinking.

And I will add, pretty sure the person you first replied to is a troll, but this issue goes beyond the scope of one dumbshit on reddit and is pretty important to discuss.\n\n[There are no underdeveloped countries, only over-exploited ones.](https://youtu.be/gSF2eOL6Zhk)\n\nIf we want to save ourselves from climate change, it will take every rich nation basically paying the bills to get their exploited colonies up to par. Colonialism is why many places today are poor, because up til recently anything of value was being extracted and sent away with next to no compensation given to the locals.\n\nReparations is always a touchy subject, since people dont like the guilt or responsibility of fixing their ancestors mistakes. But not doing something is like a kid grabbing all the toys and abruptly saying oh the game is over sorry, these are all mine now, sorry its the rules of the game I cant give them back since theyre mine!\n\nI wont soapbox too hard. People against them dont generally change their opinions in reddit threads. If you do legitimately have some intellectual curiosity to look into it, consider the case for reparations before further condemning them.

But right now, this is how these people feel and it's what's motivating their actions currently. I'm not condoning it or agreeing with it, but I am acknowledging that if we want to make changes we need to meet people at their level. Acknowledging how they feel isn't fostering hopelessness, it's an important step in any mediation process. I started mediation training at 8 years old, my elementary school had a peer mediator program. These days I work in food and beverage for a large organization, but I'm still called upon by HR for my mediation skills, for which I've received training in my professional life as well. Solutions built from one perspective usually are not going to be agreed upon by all, and if you're arguing about the real feelings they have, you're not conducive to the process of mediation. Note that I'm not saying that you have to agree with the actions or motivations. I certainly don't. But to say that you want a solution and then not listen to part of the problem (real or imagined, in the first part of the mediation process you don't call bullshit on anything) isn't helpful. A unilateral solution that dismisses the sentiment of one party but still looks good initially is not a good solution and will be temporary, and I've got a couple decades of experience to back that up.",

Adult orcas will not only swim under icebergs in unison to knock off a seal, but they will teach calves to do this as well, allowing the seal to climb back onto the iceberg to repeat the process and further practice. If the seal tires they will lift it back onto the iceberg themselves to continue. \nAt least in the case of mammals such as whales (including dolphins), elephants, and primates, it would be na\u00efve to write off their ability to interpret the effects of their actions on others simply because they cannot communicate with us.",

He is reported to have received donations of various kinds from people who saw the above footage. The second (and less reliable) article suggests he managed to get his business back up and running.\n\nOne of the officers that beat Rodney King was Laurence Powell, so searching for \"Lawrence\" in connection with the riot doesn't help you find the above clip.",

Working for pennies only to be charged more in rent and other necessities. Pushing extreme hours, physical abuse, derelict \"housing\" (a metal shack crammed with people in 100-degree heat), killing families across the border, and just so much more. It also wasn't in California as well. Florida was just as bad and it stretched across the Southern US. At one point 80% of all the tomatoes eaten by Americans were picked by these slaves. People probably think we're talking about the 1960s or something, too. But no, this was the 2000s and it has been massively quelled thanks to one single group of ex-slaves called the Coalition of Immokalee Workers.",

If it really was as simple as people wanting to destroy stuff using riots, then there\u2019d literally be nothing left\u2014no towns, no cities, no states left after riots.\n\nIt\u2019s a popular talking point from more conservative folk that riots are ruthless and only exist to destroy, and they only point to destruction that\u2019s avoidable. However, let\u2019s take a step back.\n\nRemember the Minneapolis police station being burned and raided? Remember the target? Those were signs of protests, and it was specifically targeted (no pun intended) at larger and corporate places. If you listen to the podcast \u201cBehind the Police\u201d, they go a bit more into what all happened with the rioting, but suffice to say, when people started to attack the smaller stores or just general rioting instead of focused rioting, it was individuals instead of whole people.\n\nAs for this guy here in the video, analyzing it, it\u2019s pretty interesting. I\u2019ll bet his store was one of the biggest in the neighborhood, and I bet it had the most food. When the LA Riots hit, people were really scared, so I\u2019ll bet they wanted food or some sort of tangible thing that they didn\u2019t have before.\n\nThere may be some chuds in here saying \u201cwell stealing\u2019s wrong and it can fuck over a business,\u201d but in the case of human lives, which is more important: lives or capital? All of his stuff could\u2019ve (and was) replaced, but thanks to his stuff, someone probably got to eat that night\u2014and judging by how the police reacted to the LA Riots using tanks and stuff, they needed it more than him.\n\nOverall\u2014while this is heartbreaking, rioting is a sign of something bigger and usually not just mindless violence.",

It may have been a more acceptable form of protest in the eyes of white people, but black people were still oppressed. It wasnt until he was assassinated and the King riots (or the Holy Week Uprising) happened that anyone in government considered legislative action against segregation. Of course republicans immediately used the riots to install \u201cLaw and Order\u201d (this doesn\u2019t sound familiar at all).\nMaybe the Jews in Warsaw should have protested peacefully against genocide instead of mounting an armed rebellion that destroyed property. \nI do have one problem with the LA riots.

And then I remember the cops being acquitted and I didn't really know how to parse that because I was a child. I remember my mom being upset about it and my dad trying to process it rationally. \n\nThat night, we watched the news and saw the rioting and I remember they started to show the attack on Reginald Denny and my mom pulled me out of the room because of how grisly it was. \n\nWe lived in the Los Feliz area (which wasn't super great at the time but has since become fairly upscale) and I could remember my mom and dad talking about how the riots were happening 10 or so miles and away and the police would probably contain it to South Central. \n\nThe next day, Koreatown was burning... which was about a mile from our house. I can remember seeing the smoke from our street. I missed school and my parents couldn't go to work because cops had barricaded all the major streets to keep the rioters back. \n\nThat night, a SWAT van rode down our street telling us to stay inside and reassuring us that the rioting was under control-- but that anyone seen outside would be considered a rioter and would be arrested. \n\nThe next day was pretty quiet. We still couldn't leave-- but that night, military vehicles started showing up and rolling down our street. We were only allowed to go out between certain hours for the rest of the week. I thought it was so cool to see APCs cruising the block-- mainly because I didn't understand the fact that we were under military occupation.",

Peaceful protests are good to bring attention to different issues, but things dont change with them and nothing ever has. People like to say the civil rights movement was peaceful, but they frankly weren't. At the time, sit ins and bus boycotts were seen as everything but peaceful. The big marches weren't seen as peaceful. When people are continuously protesting in ways that the people in power can ignore, nothing changes, and at that point, what else are people supposed to do. Its all just property. Its becomes a completely different issue when people are knowingly killing people for a cause though and no matter what the cause is, i dont support that, but when an issue isnt fixed or even addressed, itll just always get to that point.",

It is absolutely a myth that people \"loot and destroy\" at complete random because they like it.

I\u2019d expect that if your declaration was true, the LA riots would be at the root of the changes made to the LAPD, or at least correlated with them. \n\nThey weren\u2019t. The LAPD didn\u2019t actually institute any real change, until a massive corruption scandal, which culminated in a consent decree that saw real change to the LAPD. This happened in 2001, 9 years after the \u201892 riots. Outrage, poor approval ratings of the public, and even riots didn\u2019t amend the LAPD. \n\nYou are wrong. The most you can muster is a couple of anecdotes where rioting may have correlated in positive change. I have anecdoctes where it did the opposite.\n\nYou have hardly enough evidence to declare riots the only way to effect change.",

Not at all.\n\nIt does if the other protesters start defending them or trying to sweep it under the rug like you're doing.\n\nI've been to protests where if someone sees someone pick up a brick or spark a lighter, they ATTACK them, because they know how damaging it is to the movement.  Often it turns out those violent rioters are undercover police trying to turn the protest violent so they can move in and arrest everyone.  \n\nI'm not sure about the \"it sucks but it is what it is, we shouldn't talk about it, just ignore it\" angle though.

Also, the \"language barrier\" doesn't seem to prevent Koreans from opening businesses in predominantly Black neighborhoods.  They manage just fine.  The barrier is that the Black entrepreneurs for the most part don't speak Korean and that is used by Korean suppliers to create a barrier that could be easily solved if the Korean suppliers actually wanted to do business with Black Americans.  Do we have Korean made or Korean imported products in America?  Yes.  And it's not because white business owners learned Korean in order to place their orders.  Try again.",

There isnt discrimination based on a business owner being black, they are unwilling to sell to non-korean businesses. This is an issue for the black community because black women are disproportionately interested in hair products compared to other races.

They literally have had to shop in separate specialty stores for hair products because they can't be found in the local drug store like white hair products.  And if there is a \"ethnic\" hair section, it's 6 inches wide, next to the full aisle of products for untextured hair.  Black women are shamed on the daily for their natural hair far more than any other race.  \"Unkempt\", \"unprofessional\", \"ghetto\", unless it's pressed, straightened, styled into the equivalent of a white woman's hair texture, it's unacceptable in most businesses, even the fucking military.  If white women had to all of the sudden maintain black texture and styles instead of keeping their natural hair in order to \"look professional\", they would be equally \"obsessed\".",

Facing labor-market barriers, Korean immigrants had started their own businesses and then worked long hours to support their families. Wondering why their customers failed to take similar steps and fearful of the violent robberies that a 24-hour grocery could attract, many developed suspicious attitudes toward blacks.\n\n**In 1992, Min found that 61 percent of Korean merchants in black neighborhoods believed that \u201cblack people are generally less intelligent than white people,\u201d while nearly 70 percent believed that \u201cblack people are more criminally oriented than white people.\u201d Black customers would complain of merchants following them around, watching for evidence of shoplifting. Korean greengrocers typically hired other Koreans or Latinos rather than local blacks, whom they believed to be poorer workers. Perhaps, too, the grocers realized that Latinos were less likely to report labor-law violations: in spring 2001, Eliot Spitzer, then the state\u2019s attorney general, sued three Korean delis for paying their employees, most of them Latino, as little as $2.61 an hour, well below New York\u2019s minimum wage.**",

[Upward mobility has been declining in the US for decades.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/09/social-mobility-upwards-decline-usa-us-america-economics/) And its continuing to get worse. A rising tide raises all boats, yet we continue brushing off minority struggles as a them problem, even though in a couple more decades most of our populace will be in the same exploited position.\n\nIts not a race problem its a class problem. It just so happens our country spent the better part of 300yrs making sure race and class overlap pretty closely. And we can already see whats happening - minority communities sucked dry, so the oligarchs move on to poor whites as well, all while telling them they're poor because of minorities and the govt wants to spend THEIR tax money on dumb things like reparations.\n\nAnd here we are. A declining life expectancy for the first time in our history, rapidly increasing economic inequality, the disappearance of the middle class. The people out angry and rioting are the pot starting to boil over. When it happens in other countries we would call this a \"revolution\".",

When usage rate is equal between whites and blacks why do they police black neighborhoods more? The vast majority of offenders are non violent (solely possession charges) so it\u2019s a bit of a stretch to say it\u2019s the violence. This \u201crampant crime\u201d you refer to was government sponsored in many cases (As I said with the Regan admin) and only illegal because of those draconian drug laws. \n\nYou also don\u2019t seem to have noticed that I pointed out the sentencing disparity. Black offenders statistically were likely to be incarcerated several magnitudes longer for the same crime. \n\nNo they (Asians and such) wouldn\u2019t be policed as hard btw. They aren\u2019t the boogeyman minority used to scare whites. Asians are treated as a \u201cmodel minority\u201d which is less violent but just as insulting. \n\nBtw thanks for betraying your bias with that non sequitur on the crime bill. A bill that was supported by the black caucus at the time and was a bipartisan bill you want to exclusively associate with current president because you have partisan brain rot.",

Thank goodness, if there\u2019s one institution I trust to investigate itself it\u2019s the intelligence community. Oh wait, [it\u2019s not that clear cut](https://ips-dc.org/the_cia_contras_gangs_and_crack/). \n2.\tsuburbs aren\u2019t low income areas so it\u2019s a bad comparison first of all. Second of all you still refuse to acknowledge the sentencing disparity and the fact that the majority of drug offenses prosecuted were non violent in nature. Here\u2019s a source: https://www.britannica.com/topic/war-on-drugs and here\u2019s a relevant quote:\n\n>\tThe U.S. Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which allocated $1.7 billion to the War on Drugs and established a series of \u201cmandatory minimum\u201d prison sentences for various drug offenses. A notable feature of mandatory minimums was the massive gap between the amounts of crack and of powder cocaine that resulted in the same minimum sentence: possession of five grams of crack led to an automatic five-year sentence while it took the possession of 500 grams of powder cocaine to trigger that sentence. Since approximately 80% of crack users were African American, mandatory minimums led to an unequal increase of incarceration rates for nonviolent Black drug offenders, as well as claims that the War on Drugs was a racist institution.\n\nAlso I just want to point out that poverty is only an ingredient in crime. Population density and other factors such as rough police relations due to being overly targeted by the institution are also big contributors. I think you\u2019re talking past me to others with this point. \n\nIf you weren\u2019t going for a partisan gotcha you would\u2019ve acknowledged the bipartisan nature of the bill, not exclusively mention democrat supporters now that they\u2019re trying to fix their mistakes. The \u201cfact\u201d is true but the context in which you shared it shows partisan bias and creates a false image of what happened through omission.",

It\u2019s pointing out the decline of the \u201cnuclear\u201d family in favor of an \u201cextended\u201d family, it talks about the high rate of single black mothers, but it does little to address the WHY. Instead, it points to these issues and makes them appear to be a \u201cblack problem.\u201d  \n\nIt doesn\u2019t address the issues of mass incarceration, intermarriage rise during the mid-late 60s, lack of available jobs (Moynihan even pointed this out but failed to address why this happened in the rise towards the civil rights act), the giant influx of drugs into the lower class-black neighborhoods, and the lower overall rate of marriage amongst black individuals. I would argue, if we stripped the data of demographic information, we would collectively go \u201cwtf, WHY did this happen?!\u201d Rather than \u201cwell, they don\u2019t have fathers\u201d *wipes hands* \u201cthere is your answer!\u201d\n\nWhile I appreciate your link, it falls short (imo) of addressing anything other than saying \u201csee? Black families don\u2019t act like the white families we\u2019re used to, must be a black problem.\u201d  While the lack of a nuclear family is an indicator of child success, we need to understand why the nuclear family fell apart. That conundrum is far deeper, and has more tendrails, especially in certain demographics. \n\nAlso, just as a last point, the person who wrote this article has two college degrees, a BA and an MA\u2026.in English.  We should be careful about the logical fallacy of appealing to authority because an individual writes in a journal. Not to mention there isn\u2019t a single reference to any data she has presented. For me, this article seemed highly biased. And no, that\u2019s not me shying away from \u201cdata I find uncomfortable.\u201d",

Prisoners do more work than a good portion of people living in the United States right now, they barely see any profit from their work. \nPrisoners are still people they deserve at least shelter and sustenance. Those are basic human needs, not wants. \n\nThe need for criminal justice reform has everything to do with the failing system that capitalism is in it\u2019s current state in the United States. On that note, capitalism was only ever supposed to be a stepping stone for another economic system to replace it. \n\nDon\u2019t get it twisted like your nuts must be when you call people stupid on Reddit. There are intelligent people working on this issue. Eventually, something new will come to pass. That is what is called progress. \n\nJust because capitalism has made your life so comfortable you think your own shit smells like golden roses doesn\u2019t mean that it hasn\u2019t systemically kept generations of people in inescapable poverty. \n\nIt\u2019s a cycle. A terrible vicious cycle that can only be broken if, as a society, we accept our flaws and move forward. \n\nBut, you probably won\u2019t stop and think about this. Shit, you must think that all homeless people are scum and deserve to be homeless too. \n\nGet over yourself.",

Capitalism isn't perfect but it is preferable to the alternatives. Corruption exists everywhere. Don't confuse it with capitalism.\n\nAfter WWII, Europe was in ruins. Germany and Japan were defeated and the US, the USSR and other allied countries were victorious. Those countries that aligned with US and modeled their governments and economies similarly to the US all prospered. This included West Germany and Japan. The USSR and the countries who followed the communist model, including East Germany, all suffered in poverty with stagnant economic growth. You can deny reality all you want but capitalism has brought prosperity to the world.",

There is competition unhampered by state coersion. The state is regulated to defining things like weights and measures.

I have just stated where you were misleading in your statements.   \n\nJust because a person makes a statement that they \"explained how and why I am wrong\" does not mean they did it. The reader may use their own judgement to determine what words are true.\n\nThe definition you assigned to feudalism may have been one way it worked at a specific time in a specific place.  Most Americans that pay taxes end up paying about 33% to the government.  That means they work for the state 33% of their working hrs.  It's not exactly the same amount of hrs that is in your definition of Feudalism. The only change between your definition of Feudalism and what happens in America is a change by a matter of degrees and not as a matter of concept.  You have supported my postulation. Ergo, what America has is not capitalism.  \n\nPlease don't describe feudalism and call it capitalism. A is A. A is not B. Nor is A equal to C. \n\nI'm not going to respond to you anymore.

I'm not giving a 1/3 of my paycheck (money is a physical replacement for my time/effort) to the government. \nIn any other form of government, the boss pays me, then I give money to the government.  (Remember, money is given back, but that money was exchanged for my effort.  Money is a place holder for my sweat.   If I'm a farmer I have a growing season. I get paid once at the end of the growing season.  Money is not going to rot like live tomatoes would.  I'll still have money in the spring, not tomatoes.) \nSince we are being paid in paper (I owe to yous), instead of a commodity like gold.  You are right to say we don't own shit. If we were paid in shit, it might be more valuable.   Paper money's value is decreasing because of how much is being printed right now. Every time the federal reserve prints more money, the available money-to-sweat effort ratio decreases. The paper money becomes worth less. .....And less and less as more fiat money is added into the money pool.  At least shit is valuable to farmers as a fertilizer.   Because of all the printing of money right now, if they keep it up, a dollar bill won't buy a square of toilet paper.   Using the bill to wipe my butt seems a bit rough so it won't even be useful for that. \n\n\n\nRemember to separate work from specialization.  Specialization is where one person learns how to do one job well.  He does this one job and becomes quicker and better at it. \nI may choose to work for a boss instead of 1. Growing my own trees. 2. Cutting the tree down then into boards 3. Fashioning it into furniture and 4. finding buyers. \nI know my boss is paid more for the chair than what he gives me. But I am not taking on the risk of purchasing the machines to process the chair. I'm not paying for the building I'm working in. I'm not paying for the salaries of the support staff (receptionist, janitors, etc). I'm not paying for the advertising so people know the chairs are available to be sold.  The owner pays for ALL of that other stuff with the rest of the money that is profit from the sold chair.  \nThis way I don't have to learn how to grow trees, learn how to mine metal (for the tools and machines to cut the chairs), smith the metal (for tools), become an engineer (make the machines for sanding and fashioning the wood), create the stain and varnish. Learn carpentry. And I haven't even gotten to the part where marketing and advertising is involved.....\n\nI just learn one tiny part.  I specialize.\n\nThis usually happens in freer societies.  Right now because a lot of people don't want to take the jab they are leaving work, or are being paid not to produce, this specialized supply chain is braking down.  \nRead Atlas Shrugged, and the Creature from Jekyll Island. You'll then understand exactly what is going on in the US and why it is not a full Capitalistic society anymore.  They are great primers on how to think (A.S.) and the history of how the US lost being a capitalist society (Creature from Jekyll Island.). What they won't do is give people morality, that's a more challenging critter to come by. \nCome back to this debate after reading those books. (the books are long, but at least there are audio versions.)",

          "text": "So going after big corporate stores like that serves a purpose. It\u2019s not just looting and opportunism, it often does serve a purpose. When you want equity, you target those who keep it from happening. That involves the police, that involves stores that cater to the super wealthy, it involves the police as well. It goes way back to MLK Jr. and J. Edgar Hoover of the FBI. MLK Jr. was trying to get black people and and white people to realize they have more in common with their goals, than they do not. Hoover said \u201cthe poor black man must never make common cause with the poor white man, or the system we have will end\u201d. MLK Jr. was assassinated two weeks later. \n\nThis also ignores and dismisses how the CEO of Target, and owners of designer shops in LA all had the same response to their stores being destroyed and looted, which was: we don\u2019t care, our stores can be replaced, the lives lost to police violence cannot. Focus on that please. Don\u2019t worry about us, we\u2019re insured, our stores aren\u2019t more important than human life. You wanna go argue with the CEO of Target, who was a victim of looting, go for it, but they do have a point. \n\nSocial equity involves economic equity, so targeting obstacles to that equity is often why that happens. No, attacking small businesses isn\u2019t okay, you target large corporations who are the biggest obstacles to economic improvement for the poor.\n\nAlso do not forget that some businesses were destroyed by right wing infiltrators. Yes, protestors wrecked a target, but a right wing infiltrator burned down an Auto Zone in the same city to try and blame on regular protestors. It ended up not working, but the vast majority of protests were peaceful. They didn\u2019t make the news, because it\u2019s not newsworthy, and you\u2019re not acknowledging that because you either didn\u2019t know that, or you\u2019re more interested in demonizing the few, as opposed to praising the majority. \n\nThis is all very complicated, but you\u2019re basically doing what the right wing wants you to do. Stay angry at a few, to the exclusion of the overwhelming majority who did nothing wrong. \n\nWhen people protest peacefully, they often still get told \u201cno, don\u2019t protest like that either\u201d. So some get angrier and angrier until they feel like they have nothing but destruction left in order to be heard. The way the news only covers destruction, and not peaceful protests backs up those feelings. \n\nSome things to consider.",

Any good reasons they had for rioting (and they certainly had many) become null and void to many who see a video like this. \n\nDuring the Minneapolis riots last year, a similar video came out of a local business owner sobbing because they just lost everything to the riots. Awful situation for them. This video is the ONLY thing my grandmother remembers when the topic of the riots or of the police gets brought up. It doesn't matter what else might happen, because she is always going to think of that poor woman in tears because rioters ruined her life. And there are millions of people like my grandmother who think the same way. When the rioters stop burning police stations and start destroying peoples' lives \u2014 the same people they're supposed to be rioting for \u2014 it only hurts those people and hurts their cause.\n\nIt's so goddamn frustrating. The bullshit \"just a couple of bad apples\" line that people try to use to defend cops \u2014 well it goes for the rioters too.",

Sure, there are some greedy capitalists that hoard wealth with a strong lack of philanthropy and generosity, but most businesses are owned by common people. Good people. People who want to provide for their families and communities. \n\nIf you are one who believes in the burning of a business, you need to strongly reevaluate your life choices and who you spend your time around. \n\nBusinesses are only as inherently evil as money. They are both vessels. In the same way a car can provide shelter and transportation, or can be used in a killing spree. \n\nIt comes down to the individual. Not all drivers of a car are to blame for what transpired in Waukesha. Just as not all business owners are responsible for capitalist greed within large corporations.",

They act like activist when really they are just hypocrites trying to act like they are going to change the world but when it is even a minor inconvenience to them they don't care. It's like that picture of girl sitting in a Starbucks with her MacBook pro and her f**k capitalism sticker on it. Then people come to her defense saying oh then what is she supposed to do? like she can't live without $7 lattes. You really want to hurt these companies stop buying from them. Educate yourself on how many products these companies own, do communal gardening learn to live a minimalist lifestyle ect. They won't even do that because it's inconvenient to them but yes let's burn small businesses down to hurt corporations. It's no better than putting a hashtag on a particular issue on your Instagram then going on with your daily life doing nothing about said issue. The world is just full of self righteous hypocrites.

Don't you remember \" fiery, but mostly peaceful protests\".\n\nI was on the west side of Los Angeles when it was happening too. And no one who had eyes who could see the aftermath in Santa Monica, promenade 3rd, 4th Street, and sit here and tell me it was peaceful. Being told we can't leave our houses after 6 pm. I remember well.\n\nPeople saying burn loot murder is just pure logical conclusions because they arent dumb and could see what was happening. \n\nSame as this video, people called it justice, but looted their own.\n\n I'm of African Americans descent, and even I realized it wasn't right to destroy businesses and call it \"justice\".\n\nAnd those people stoking violence, directing looters and handing out money. Those were LEFT wing extremists.",

The difference is subtle, but the implication makes all the difference: it\u2019s not like she would have found watching the audiences at the Olympic gymnastics scary (which probably had plenty of USA hats+white guys).\n\nSimilarly, she didn\u2019t say black men who look like they\u2019re in gangs, or black people in a church choir, or muslims who are holding flags and carrying AK-47s in the desert, or a Muslim man teaching poetry at university in Cairo \u2014 she ONLY referred to blacks, Muslims, Mexican groups very generically.\n\nThe white guy / hat / conf flag sticker is not representative of white people in general, in fact it implies a specific subset of white folks with beliefs - and this is important - it is those beliefs she finds scary. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to be scared of passing my coworker Debra from accounts payable as she does her walk outside during lunch break.\n\nThis isn\u2019t evidence of a war on white guys \u2014 it\u2019s a lame joke about how her past experiences led her to be scared of dudes who want to rep the confederate flag. \nThe same way most people would probably be at least a little weary walking on the street if a creepy looking clown or meth head was coming towards them.",

Legit just doesn\u2019t bother me I guess? I have too many of my own problems, haha! Corporations are just chasing profits, anyway, and they\u2019re not all good at it either. In general, if something were truly \u201cacceptable\u201d you wouldn\u2019t need to make a big deal about it, ya know? Like the Vince Lombardi Jr quote - \u201cwhen you go to the end zone, act like you\u2019ve been there before.\u201d For example, if you saw Avengers End Game there\u2019s a scene when all the women get the Thanos glove, and they line up. There was a deleted scene that kinda had a better explanation for it, but it felt so forced that no one liked it because it felt like pandering. Basically, sometimes shits over-done to compensate (like if you know any short guys with loud/expensive/big cars) but all of that\u2019s never bothered me, and I guess that\u2019s why I asked what war you were talking about. \n\nYou\u2019re prob not much older than me by the 9/11 reference. Out of curiosity, the many small things you referenced \u2014 are these actually things you see IRL in your daily life or are they mostly from the news/social media? Because like bro the news/social media is mostly nonsense tryna sell us shit / keep us watching \u2014 or just tryna pit poor folks against each other, ya know. And so that\u2019s why I ask: for me IRL outside of the internet / news there\u2019s literally none of that bitterness towards me, personally, afaik \u2014 and any bitterness towards white dudes maybe goes over my head? Or it\u2019s more of a hypothetical bitterness that\u2019s not really aimed at anyone specific? Either way I really just haven\u2019t experienced anything like that irl. \n\nThat said, personally I don\u2019t think we can talk about conflicts between divisions of people like race without economics being the elephant in the room. I didn\u2019t grow up rich, my parents were like POOR-poor, but we eventually got a little above living paycheck-to-paycheck, and like I work hard and have done alright for myself. So my general approach to others has always been sympathetic to anyone struggling bc the world kinda sucks for mostly everyone - sure, some more than others. Like hypothetically IF they say my struggle was not as bad as someone of color\u2019s struggle (all other things being equal), then damn, ok, I mean, that really sucks \u2014 because even if it was the exact same level of struggle, then shit dude, this has NOT been a cake walk. Ya know? \n\nAlso Idk, I\u2019m generally somewhat of a pessimist, but I try to remind myself that only the worst people ever make the news, and that most folks would stop to help you change a tire if you needed it.",

I appreciate your take on this, so don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but it just all sounds like fear-mongering. \n\nI mean, if you\u2019re familiar with the concept of a \u201czero-sum game\u201d \u2014 one where for every winner there\u2019s a loser \u2014 and then took that as your single world view, then ok I could kinda see how adding diversity means fewer spots for white guys. But like, that\u2019s a very narrow and one-dimensional way to consider something as complex as an economy, and definitely not how nearly anything works in the real world. If it did, the economy wouldn\u2019t be growing and technology couldn\u2019t be advancing. Like, this isn\u2019t a sport or something where only one person/team goes home with gold. Plus if it were, you would still be competing against other white guys on other merits (experience, creativity, problem solving skills, or other relevant skills), which, by definition, means that the logic of using this one yardstick of race isn\u2019t really as important. Ones background may be correlated with their skin color, but it\u2019s kinda silly to blow it\u2019s influence out of proportion with individuals in the workplace: working with a lawyer from Boston vs an electrician from Minnesota are going to be very different experiences regardless of whether their skin color matches or not. \n\nIn short: the world is not a zero-sum game, and maybe part of why explaining your point is so difficult is because these hypothetical scenarios where white people \u201close\u201d or \u201care losing\u201d are based on this flawed underlying assumption that has no tangible merits in the real world. \n\nAnd like I said, I busted my ass to get to where I am today but it wasn\u2019t easy, and I already believe I\u2019m overqualified for most jobs. I still get a decent number of cold-call interview requests on LinkedIn per month, because there\u2019s always people retiring and there\u2019s always something new to do.",

No one today so much as blinks an eye about that, let alone have ever called them vigilantes, but when some kid comes in and tries to do basically the same thing, and ends up shooting three people after being violently assaulted while trying to run to the safety of the police line, he's the scum of the earth and people started rioting again after he was rightfully released. History is a beautiful thing...",

The facts of the case were as follows: his father lived in Kenosha, he had other family there, and (I'm fuzzy on this) I'm sure he knew the owners of some of the businesses in that area. He went there to provide aid and safety to those being affected or caught in the crossfire. Those are facts, either from hard evidence or his sworn testimony. Now, to me, that sounds pretty similar. Yes, he walked TO the riots; where in 92 the riots came to THEM. I'm simply pointing out the hypocrisy of people who should already know the facts. One is a villain while the others are heroes, even though the end results were the same.",

Regardless of why you're there, if you are not taking part in the riots, you have every right to defend yourself with an amount of force comparable to situation. Back in 92, they were defending their very lives and livelihoods, and as a result, rioters were killed. Today, rioters were tearing apart a place where Kyle deemed close to his heart, and as a result he felt the need to defend it and ultimately had to defend HIMSELF from two rioters who were intent on harming/killing him.",

I've got little patience for the same tired concern trolling. I get my side of this conversation might be a bit esoteric.\n\nY'all are implying intention that doesn't exist. [Kettling](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettling) followed by mass dispersion techniques cause riots, because that's what happens when you force a lot of people into a small space and then beat the shit out of them. It's crabs in a bucket except you're slamming the bucket repeatedly with a ping pong paddle.\n\nThat same panic causes [crowd surges](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/11/06/us/what-is-a-crowd-surge/index.html) and gets people killed like at astroworld. That panic is weaponized here to sow as much violence and chaos as possible. The psychology of large group violence is fairly understood, at least enough to know if you get a bunch of strangers together, wear them out, then scare the shit out of them, the first one to throw a brick will trigger a tidal wave in the entire group. The symptom of looting and burning is completely irrelevant, an extremely visible distraction played to the pearl-clutching general public to win sympathy for the \"thin blue line trying to bring law and order\" and entirely hides the actual source of the violence. We've had international trials on this. We'll keep having more. American courts won't ever recognize this shit for the war crime it is because it's so vital to the way they maintain power right now.\n\nThe OP is sad but it's posting here is extremely targeted and the video is framed very specifically to cause you, the average person, to shift blame away from the actual cause of the violence. All of this dude's moralizing about what's right don't mean a thing because they aren't actually focused on the source of the conflict.\n\nThat's why I'm annoyed. He may genuinely have been trying (I don't think so) and couldn't engage because I was obtuse (I feel like I gave multiple opportunities for engagement before I just started slinging the crypto accusations). It's hard to have patience with strangers who are operating from bad faith 70% of the time and willful ignorance another 25% of the time. OP is a psyop, or a particularly opportunistic and malicious karma farm. American cops abuse people like this because the PR works so *fucking* well. They don't give a shit about the damages and they especially don't give a shit about the neighborhoods they set these bombs off in.\n\nGenuinely, talk to anyone who was actually on the ground at any of these riots. Hear what they have to say leading up to it. Bonus points if you find someone willing to talk about why they started chucking shit too. Fear fucks you up.",

Genuinely broke as fuck and desperate people will see an opportunity for a quick buck and then look to hide the evidence. Some people really do just love violence and will take the opportunity in the anonymity of the crowd. But the biggest reason really is just blind fear. It shuts down your brain and you react on instinct. Your group, the one under threat, will lash out in every direction (like the crab analogy) and indiscriminately until the threat goes away and you can flee. \n\nIt can be rationalized a little bit if you think about what the group is trying to do, be intimidating enough that the aggressors move on. Portland provides a really fascinating handbook on how this should go down from the protestors perspective in a whole lot of ways, but let's just focus on kettling. In the first few days of Portland's \"riots\" (really just an extremely lengthy siege of the fed building), protestors were kettles and banged like so many other \"successful\" (from the PD's perspective) riots in the south. But the damage was pretty minimal and the protestors were focused enough to not only loudly and thoroughly warn people what would happen, but to also organize specific responses to the ways they would be kettled. They neutralized gas cans like they did in Hong Kong, the built shield phalanxes out of trash to stop rubber bullets, and they kept their movements quick and unpredictable. All of the times Portland protests made it the fed building, the cops were suddenly alot more nervous about encircling them and suppressing them than they were in the initial \ndays.\n\nWhy? Surely if the cops kettled here, they would arrest dozens of people and probably nab key players off the street. They were so eager in the early days, why when the protestors posed an actual threat to their operations would they suddenly stop using their most tried and true tactics? To be clear, Portland protestors at the fed building were ultimately dispersed by the fed each night but without the kettle tactic i.e. actually dispersed and allowed to scatter back in to the city only to do it again the very next day.\n\nBecause Portland PD and the fed feared the foregone property damage that would come if they made a significant move to break and detain the crowd at the fed. The feared the violence that would break out from largely peaceful protesters if they had no option, violence the PD couldn't contain because it would be so close to home and thus put a ton of their officers at actual risk for harm. They ramped up their suppression efforts and just started black bagging people off the streets after curfew. But they never caged those protestors. Portland is unique in that the wild majority of the property damage was to PD and fed owned assets. Alot of things were different about Portland for sure, but it seems to me the reason for this disparity lied squarely in the protest's ability to defeat kettling.",

BTP was directed precisely at English property and Cosignees, in this case two of the governor's son's, who used his power in office to thwart the will of the people (who resorted to passive means everywhere else). They didn't attach fellow citizens and specifically targeted enemy property (if these people were busting up rich white folks homes and burning down police stations your analogy would be right )\n\nOP is trolling but the right way to handle things was closer to Chaz, attacking the power structure and not further victimizing a group that was victimized. Hell the recent raids on Nordstroms and Louis make the point without revictimizing local businesses in victimized communities.",

Number one, the police employ a tactic of you can only riot in a black neighborhood, we won\u2019t stop it we won\u2019t arrest anyone\u2026as long as you burn down the black neighborhood. The rioters want to move forward and out to make the oppressors feel the same feeling of helplessness, but they literally cannot. Because the police only police the neighboring white/affluent side. Rioting isn\u2019t necessarily outrage for outrages sake. Quite often isn\u2019t really an issue of a broken social contract. In that there is no justice for the atrocities that brown and black people still face in 2021, why should they (the rioters and looters) hold up their end of the deal to not do that when they receive an unfair justice system. So essentially it boils down to fuq it, let\u2019s burn it all. If Im not allowed to have mine why should you have yours? Is it right, nope not even a little. But does it make sense to be that angry, yes beyond yes. Even a beaten dog will try to bite you, why would people be any different. Change the justice system in this country and literally we would have peace overnight. The problem is the system works for some and others flat out enjoy it even though it means profiting off of someone else\u2019s pain. \n\nDon\u2019t believe me\u2026the initial prosecutor in the admaud arbery killing told police officers to not arrest or investigate the murder because Gregory mcmichael was a friend. It wasn\u2019t until the video was leaked that they had to do something. That prosecutor is now going to be on trial for flat out denying justice. And the kicker is that this is not even by a little bit the first time this has happened. Justice deferred is justice denied.",

And even THEN the white apologists were trying to ignore the obvious and callous misconduct.  He died of drugs.  He died of being a bad person.  Etc etc.\n\nWe should\u2019ve been fixing these things years ago, long before riots and mass unrest were elicited.  Shame on us as a country, and shame on the white pride assholes around the country now working to ban education materials that touch on race and slavery.   If we care about this country, we need to teach its full history, not a whitewashed version that doesn\u2019t acknowledge our mistakes. \n\nThat\u2019s ultimately how we make these injustices largely go away \u2014 one educated generation at a time.",
