  "text": "TIFU by playing with my tinder dates cat\nThrowaway account because this is really embarrassing. This actually happened today, about 30 minutes ago. \n\nSo I went on a tinder date with this girl last night, it was great, she's really pretty and we had a great time. We came back to her place as it was close by and ended up doing the deed multiple times and ended up in bed. Now I haven't had much action in a while and it really tired me out, so I slept like a rock.\n\nFast forward to about half an hour ago and I wake up butt naked, alone in her bed, but I can hear her downstairs in the kitchen. So I'm tossing and turning for a bit when all of a sudden this gorgeous grey floofy kitty comes and hops on the bed and starts purring like mad, I happily oblige and pet the shit out of it. I love cats. I didn't have the covers on me as it was hot and this cat felt so soft, flopping itself against my skin. \n\nSo the cat starts getting playful, hopping over my body from one side to the next, and I'm rolling side to side tickling its belly inbetween, but when I roll ove next, my schlong flips over with me, sailing through the air in a perfect arch, just before it slapped my belly the cat pounced straight onto it and dug two paws in, one on the shaft and one on the head (much like last night). I fucking screamed in agony, sat up and started trying to pull its claws out my sausage. The one on my head came off straight away but there was a claw still hanging on for dear life about halfway down which was fully lodged. The cat started to panic because it was stuck. I heard my date running upstairs and as she came in I was sat up with her cat buried in my crotch holding onto its leg trying to free it. I whimpered 'cock stuck, help' and she burst out laughing but reached over and unhooked the last claw out my shaft, leaving me naked and embarrassed. \n\nI waddled over to the bathroom with blood trickling down onto my ballsack and sat on the toilet dabbing the little holes with tissue. I'm still sat here now, with tissue pressed against my member as it write this. Going to have a shower I think.\n\ntl;dr Played with my tinder dates cat the morning after and they thought my cock was a toy, claws got stuck in multiple places now I have a sore penis.\n\nEdit: OK I've been reading a lot of comments and apparantly I should see a doctor?? How the fuck do I explain this scenario??",

Rarely you can get cat scratch fever from an infected cut. Bites are a different story. 1/3 of cat bites end up in being admitted into the hospital it's that serious. Their teeth are long and thin, puncture wounds like this (also like if you had stepped on a nail) do not heal well on their own, the top scabs over and creates the perfect environment for the common tetanus bacteria and other common bacteria to multiply extremely well. And the deepness of the puncture can give the bacteria quick access to the deeper blood vessels which go through the body, giving much less time for the immune system to destroy the bacteria from traveling through the entire body. Untreated this can end up as sepsis and death.",

Apparently it is recommended for high risk wounds.  \n\n\n\"Cochrane review of nine trials showed no statistical difference in infection rate between prophylaxis and no treatment, except in bite wounds to the hand.19 In hand wounds, antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the rate of infection from 28% to 2% (odds ratio = 0.10; number needed to treat = 4). However, studies were heterogeneous and used different antibiotics. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be used for high-risk bite wounds\"",

The real problem is that they cause puncture wounds, which have a higher likelihood of burying the bacteria kind of deep in the skin. If the wound bleeds a bit that's actually a good thing because it should push the bacteria back out, but a lot of puncture wounds hardly bleed at all. So if you have signs of infection after a cat bites/claws you, you def should get antibiotics asap.",

Nurse here, hi, you definitely want to get seen by a doctor.\n\nCat scratch fever is only one of many things cats can carry.\n\nI've personally cared for *several* patients that have had to have amputations from infections in that area.\n\nBe proactive.\n\nEdit:\n\nCat scratch fever is just one of many bacteria that cats can carry, toxoplasmosis is another major infection that they are known to carry and it can affect unborn children which is why pregnant women should not be handling litter boxes, you can also affect adults or anyone who has an immune compromise.\n\nForniers gangrene and necrotizing fasciitis are also two bacteria that love to take up residence in dark, damp spaces. Necrotizing fasciitis can be caused by multiple different bacteria, but one of the major causes is strep A.\n\nWhile both are more common in people that are overall in poor health and/or hygiene, \n\nAnd the American journal of pediatrics says up to 50% of cat bites and scratches can become infected whereas only 10 to 15% of dog bites become infected.",

I waited almost 24 hours and felt super weird after work the next day and when I went the nurse practitioner gave me an antibiotic shots and oral meds. I was working at our contracted hospital lab doing infectious disease processing for my biotech job and the microbiologists said I needed to go immediately after the incident. Then sister told me a horror story about how one of their coworker professors was hospitalized for a month including ICU after his incident\u2026.so yeah\n\nEdit : my cat was indoors, doesn\u2019t matter, he catches bugs, frogs, and before incident caught a hummingbird all on the 3rd floor deck",

But, illness, injury, disruption to what would otherwise be a normal healthy immune system combined with poor hygiene can cause bacterial overgrowth.\n\nGetting a cat claw hooked into your dick so badly it requires forceful removal..... That's definitely cause to be concerned and checked out by a doctor.\n\nAnd no your dick isn't going to fall off if you get a sore throat for too long, however, untreated strep throat can cause scarlet fever and untreated Scarlet fever can lead to rheumatic fever which can cause permanent heart damage.",

The only way out can reproduce is in the gut of cats. So it infects rodents, reduces their fear response, makes them more aggressive, so instead of running from cats they try and fight them, cat kills and eats rodent, toxoplasmosis enters cats digestive system, where it reproduces, and is passed through cat shit, where it's discarded, gets picked up by rodents/birds, cycle starts again.\n\nHumans, sheep, and pigs are also capable of getting it. Humans can also get it by eating undercooked meet from susceptible animals, such as pork.\n\nBut it's only definitive hosts are domestic cats and their relatives.\n\nWhich means any cat has the potential to get it.\n\nI'm not sure where you live but I live in the Appalachian region in a very rural setting so field mice are very common and they do get into houses. Even a house cat will try and eat a rat.\n\n\nThe bacteria associated with cat scratch fever, is usually carried in fleas, lice, and ticks.\n\nThe chance of a 100% indoor cat from developing and being a carrier are low, but never 0%, especially if your cat is a rescue, has ever received blood from another cat, or ever been exposed to fleas/ticks.",

An urgent care clinic , not an ER if you can. (less expensive for you and the health care system)    Or-- You might go to a vet clinic.  They've probably had other cat owners getting claws stuck in them.  lol lol",
