The goals original gay rights movement from the 1950s to the early 1980s was for gay, lesbian and bisexual people to be left alone. Then about half of the gay men in western countries died of aids because of unprotected sex and drug use, allowing the lesbians to take over.\n\nSo the lesbians and bisexual women took over, and it all went to shit. They added transformers to the movement, they demanded affirmative action laws that were supposed to benefit LGBT people but only resulted in incompetent LGBT people getting jobs that weren\u2019t meant for them, they demanded radical feminist legislation, they demanded hate speech laws, and they demanded gender identity laws that allowed transformers to identify however they please just by filling out forms. That last part backfired, however, so now lesbians are bullied into having sex with transformers.\n\nAdmittedly, gay men are partly to blame for this. The AIDS epidemic would not have been nearly as bad as it was if most of us wore condoms and avoided using drugs. Most of the gay men who survived were either bitter femboys who sided with the dy.k3s and their destructive agenda, or pushovers who allowed the takeover to occur. This left the subsequent generations of gay men with very few proper role models from the gay community, so they don\u2019t know how to contribute to society in a positive way. Some of them end up looking up to straight women as role models, and they end up becoming stupid as a result. There are a lot of gay men who are based, but we see the writing on the wall because we\u2019re outnumbered by the elderly dy.k3s who won\u2019t relinquish power, so we\u2019re just gonna have to wait until they die off, until a bunch of gay men with actual spines come and takeover the movement by force, or until society turns against the LGBT movement and the dy.k3s flee the scene.",
