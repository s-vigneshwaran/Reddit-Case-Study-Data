  "text": "TIFU by yelling at a horny cat.\nSo, we've got **hundreds** of feral/stray cats living in the woods behind my house. When I can, I TNR (trap, neuter, release) them. The local place will give them their shots, spay/neuter them, and then \"ear tip\" them to mark them as fixed, all for $27, pretty great deal. \n\nSo, at about 2am (~2 hours ago as I type this), I was woken by a horny cat howling outside my window. I chase it off with a can of pennies. I fall back to sleep, and 15 minutes later, it wakes me up again. So I yell out my window to the cat \"If you don't shut your whore mouth right this instant I will **lock you in a cage**!\" (referring to the traps I use). The cat runs off, and I get back to sleep. \n\nWell, about half an hour ago, I had 4 cop cars in my driveway and a few angry State Troopers pounding on my door. I explain what happened, they interview all 6 people in the house, and then they leave, satisfied that I was not a domestic abuser who locks her wife in a cage at night.  \n\n\n**TL;DR: Yelled at a horny cat, got accused of domestic violence.**",

The cow never liked me messing with him, and whenever I was around, she'd be giving me the hairy eyeball after that. \n\nWell, when the calf was a couple months old, we were switching pastures. All the cows and calves were up at the lot drinking, so we'd close one gate and open another. \n\nHowever, brain damage calf never went up, so I was out trying to get him up to the lane. He never could walk straight and would go in circles and fall down from time to time.\n\nAfter an hour struggling, I'm covered in sweat and cow shit but we're approaching the gate.  This is when mama cow sees me, and she's not happy.\n\nShe starts tossing her head in the way a cow does before charging. But I'm in no mood for her, so I just lose it. I'm yelling \"Just try me!\" and \"Come at me, bitch!\"\n\nI hear this noise I can't place. I'd put a lock screen on my phone that week because when I'd sweat it would somehow call my recent contacts from my pocket. But apparently if you lock your phone, the only number it can call is 911.\n\nSo I've got the sheriff's office on the line and I'm trying to explain that I'm just working cattle. I'm guessing the dispatcher had some cattle experience because they seemed to understand.",

That phone would always pocket dial people, and I would get pocket dials from friends who had the same phone.\n\nOne day in gym class I started receiving a lot of calls. The teach caught me looking at my phone and confiscated it. Shortly after I was called to the office, where a cop began accusing me of prank calling 911 because I was \u201cbored in class\u201d.\nMy phone had called some random number like 747392074911 which had gone to 911, where they would hear a bunch of kids hollering in the background. Then they tried calling back a bunch of times. Apparently it would have been more believable as an accident if it had been 12345678911. I don\u2019t know how that math checked out in the cops head. Got detention for that.",

I said well my cat is named bill would you like to speak with him? and then it hit all 3 of us at the same time and had a decent laugh about it. just got told to chill out a  little bit maybe on the cat",

No questions, no real evidence, they just planned on taking me straight to jail. My wife started crying and begging them to let me go. It took about 2 hours for them to let me go and even then they said I wasn\u2019t allowed to stay in my own house. At that point my wife was pissed and called a lawyer friend. They lawyer was over at our place in 10 minutes and had to threaten all kinds of lawsuits before the police backed down. \n\nThey had the audacity to warn me that if they ever came back they wouldn\u2019t be as nice. I no longer have much trust in the police.",

It's like some of them are just incapable of reading a situation but have access to a firearm. Especially in this case, without even asking what was going on. \n\nIt's not uncommon for victims to try and save their abusers. Because in their eyes, they still think the anger and violence is their own fault, and they often feel whatever happens with the police will be taken out on them. So it would be a good thing they didn't immediately back down if they didn't take it a full 180 and go way, way too hard on the situation. \n\nIn some states, they're not allowed to let people stay together for the night after a domestic dispute, but... considering they had clear indicators there wasn't one, it shouldn't have been an issue. \n\nSo sorry you both dealt with that!",

Uprooted colonies just leave room for another one to move in, but a colony gradually reduced in size by TNR will stop growing and then decrease without the power vacuum.  It also gives the colony supervisor the chance to find other colonies that are adjacent and start TNR'ing that one too.",

If you can't take care of an animal then don't own an animal in your home. Do you people think that every animal must have an home ? \n\n\n2) the stray cats and dogs don't need you to feed them. If you are THAT poor then you can just pet them and move on without giving them anything or just go past them you don't even need to pet them if you don't want to. Someone else that can feed them will feed them. The cats and dogs can stay on the streets and if people can feed them they can give them food put it close to the cat, walk away and the cat or dog can eat it. You can give your left overs to the animals if you cannot finish the food you cooked. This way the food won't go into the trash and the animals will have some food to eat. I'm not saying give them any food if it's dangerous to the animal obviously don't give it to the animal. There is a lot of people in this world and if you are unwilling to share some food with them then don't worry (not like you did anyways) I'm sure that someone else will give them something to eat and something to drink\n\n3) I'm assuming that most of you in here are living in European/North American countries where your economy is great, you can buy basically anything you want without many problems. I want you to remember that i live in Turkey. You can buy something in a month but for me to buy that same thing I'll have to work for several months possibly up to a year. Meat and fish are a luxury here they are not something we get to eat very often. It's expensive and we don't have the money thanks to our shit economy. But we still share our food with the animals when we can and we even share our food with our neighbours when it's an important holiday for example. You're telling me that you are so selfish that you won't share some of your food with an animal even tho you live in a great economy where buying meat isn't something you have to think through ? I believe you are lying. And even if you are telling the truth you can do what i said before you know just move on. If you are really poor, don't have anything to give on you or if you are just incredibly selfish then yeah move on someone else that can will share their food with the animals so they don't starve.\n\nHow selfish can you people be ? And against an animal too. What has an animal done to you to deserve this treatment ? And on top of that you guys are much safer, healthier and richer then the rest of the world (again assuming you are from a Western nation like Europe or North America) yet you are some of the most selfish people I've seen on this planet. It's incredible really.",

A lot of the time, strays were kicked from their previous homes, because the kid didn't want the responsibility of taking care of it, even when they're mostly asking for a pet.\n\nThe reason we spay/neuter animals, is to give the animals a better life, without running the risk of the animals/litters dying because there isn't enough food from mom, or the mom decided to leave, or the mom died during the birthing process.\n\nI don't care where you live, simply because it doesn't matter that you live in Turkey, the point is, spaying/neutering animals gives them a better chance at life so overpopulation doesn't put them in shelters where they'll get little to no care depending on the facility.\n\nI'm team \"Adopt, don't shop\" for the reason that most animals that end up in a shelter, were dumped there because their owners didn't want them, they were lost and found, or they were just a stray. About 50% of animals bought at a pet shop end up becoming neglected, even when bought by a wealthy family, because they show no care, or because they'll just throw them in a garbage bag, or a box, and leave them in a dumpster or the side of the road.",

People who get a pet and then don't take care of the pet they got are the worst kinds of people I've always wanted some pets but i never ended up getting one simply because i can't look after them. Taking care of myself from bills to food is already expensive and I'm not sure if i can handle a cat on top of that but yeah on that point I agree with you \n\nAs for the overpopulation itself I've never seen it as a problem. I've seen a lot of stray animals and they've always been really friendly. For the few that didn't look friendly i just walked away from them. I've never seen overpopulation being an issue not where i live at least and I'm fairly certain that Turkey must be one of those places with a really high number of stray animals. I've seen a lot and the few people that i talked to that visited my country often talked about the stray animals in here. Maybe things are different over in the West maybe you guys have more stray animals, maybe less i don't know. But i still don't see overpopulation as a problem simply because I've never seen the side effects of it. \n\nI still believe trapping them and all that is wrong. It doesn't sound right to me I see no upsides to it and im certain we can take care of the stray animals if at least some people give them some food every now and then. I think it's better to allow them as best as we can to live their life even if it might be on the streets. In all honestly with how cruel the streets (and just random fucked up people or random cars) can be i don't think over population will ever become a problem. As fucked up as that sounds i believe it's correct. Again most of what I'm saying is based on my own experiences, the things I've seen and what i believe is right maybe things are different over where you live. I sure hope you don't have any of these weird refugees cutting up cats tails and saying \"they are doing magic\" I've seen fucked up people thanks to all the weird subreddits I've found but i never thought I'd see people like that IRL",

Too many neighbors are willing to ignore the noises because they \"don't want to get involved\" when we live in a time where, if anything, we need to be getting more involved. More involved with the world, more involved with each other. The saying goes \"it takes a village to raise a man\" and as the days and years drag on, it feels like the village is slowly but steadily dying. And I bet it's pretty difficult raising raising a man in a dead village.\n\nAlso, **FUCK** horny cats. Not in the way you'd normally fuck something horny, though. Those fuckers can and are loud and annoying as all fuck out. Good on you for doing TNR. I've been doing the same thing at my dad's because there are a metric fuckton of cats in his area, but it can get pretty costly.  Sounds like you lucked out in finding the right place for the damn right price too. Keep up the awesome work you are doing for the community and area around you. Even if sometimes it may not feel like a lot a direct action, it's the consequential ripples that you are preventing are the kind that would have caused a catastrophe if not taken care of. What you do is appreciated by many people who will never even realise what it is they have to appreciate. Being overrun by cats sucks and it's people like you who help make things otherwise.

Most people do not have microchip scanners and even then microchips add 30$ to the cost of the spay or neuter if you are lucky, which would be a reduction in the amount of animals you could TNR by 50%. Not to mention if a cat is tipped you can immediately release and rebait a trap, but if its not youd have to wait to take in to the vet. Overall its just not feasible and would result in way less cats being fixed, increase in population, and finally an increase in euthanasia due to population. So yeah over euthanasia i think ear tipping is more desirable",
