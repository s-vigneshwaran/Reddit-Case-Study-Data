I'm on my first watch through of the original series and some things just amaze me that we take for granted these days. \n\nFor example, in one episode there is a time travel plot back to the 1960s when the series was created. A pilot gets introduced to Lieutenant Uhura and the man is perplexed that a woman could be a Lieutenant. \n\nI'm sure there were many heated debates at the time regarding women in the workplace and the feminist movement, so seeing that one moment just kind of shocked me. These movements have progressed so much over the decades and it's incredible to see Star Trek pushing these social boundaries. They knew there would be equality and they went all in with it and basically said fuck the haters. \n\nIt's great that everyone can accept social commentaries and inclusion of marginalized groups in today's medi.... Oh wait, no nevermind...\n\nEdit: Well fuck, RIP Lieutenant Uhura",

I didn't flip back and forth between series just because one had an episode with a time-line that overlapped a different series. I also didn't watch any of the animated series.\n\nSo, in short, I can't answer your question because I never watched most of the series when they first aired.\n\nEdit to add: Am enjoying Season 3 of Oroville.

Originally Roddenberry had put a woman where she was definitely going to be in command of the ship from time to time, consulted regularly, and shown deference by the crew. IIRC he was told women shouldn\u2019t even be on the bridge. In response he put a black woman as communications officer and a woman as yeoman who brings orders to the captain for signatures. He also shifted number one\u2019s inverse of the \u2018emotional women\u2019 stereotype to Spock.\n\n> Number One was a role embodied by Gene's future wife, Majel Barrett, and, as the female First Officer of a starship, she was a revolutionary character for 1966. Too revolutionary for NBC, as it turned out, as the network requested both Number One and Spock (Leonard Nimoy), to be cut from the second Star Trek pilot NBC requested. Wanting to keep an alien on the bridge of the Enterprise, Roddenberry was forced to drop Number One and he gave her cool, logical, emotionless traits to Spock, which would come central traits of the Vulcan and his entire race. \n\n\nLieutenant Uhura might have been respected on screen, but behind the scenes Nichelle Nichols had a rough time and almost quit. She stayed because of a little black girl who talked to her about how great it was to see a black woman doing great things on tv.\n\nRIP Nichelle Nichols, your endurance helped dismantle both racism and sexism by inspiring generations to nurture and show their capabilities.",

That's a *major* part of why people liked them.\n\nIt's just that there are a lot of people that hear a popular song and just kinda go with it, or see it as an opportunity to spread their *own* message, without much thought to any deeper meaning (or only listen to a particular line or 2 that they like, and focus on). The people that don't care about the lyrics are usually bandwagonners that only like a song because it's popular.\n\nThat's only my opinion/conjecture, of course; it's hard to really know just how many people pay much attention to lyrics/meaning.",

Did they say which \"fortunate one\" was meant to be Gore -- the senator's son, the one with the silver spoon in hand, or the war-mongering one?\n\nFTR, when his deferment ended, Gore enlisted in the Army and served in Vietnam. From Fox News:\n\n*Former Vice President Al Gore, son of the late Sen. Al Gore Sr., was the only senator\u2019s son to participate in active duty in Vietnam throughout the eight-year war. Twenty-seven sons of House members also served in Vietnam.  [[source]](https://www.foxnews.com/story/handful-of-lawmakers-send-their-kids-to-war*\n\nGore served as a reporter with a military publication. There's no record of anyone asking for special treatment for him - but of course, Army brass knew who he was. He also had a recent Harvard degree, which made it unlikely he'd be assigned a \"grunt\" position.\n\nHis college advisor says Gore enlisted, rather than serving as an officer, because most Tennesseeans served as enlisted men; his college roommate says Gore said if he didn't go someone would have to go in his place.",

There are many scenes where Federation folks are playing poker... presumably with real financial consequences since we see the bid get too rich and they fold due to lack of funds. We see them buy each other things and owe each other. Whether you call it Chuck Cheese tokens, latinum, or dollars, it's money rather than straight barter. And then there are those things called Federation Credits... which sounds like money to me. \n\nReally appreciated the quotes link! Very interesting. Thanks!",

Even the government was at a loss because of how obviously wrong it was, to the point they just went like \"okay we can't just let brexit happen, but it'd be the most undemocratic thing ever to ignore the results\", so they stayed in a stalemate with the EU in a \"permanently leaving\" state, since technically there was no rule on when to leave.\n\nAll that is old news and situation's different now afaik, the clusterf*ck government became now just started chugging in the wrong direction without worries. But still, your point is very valid.",

Should that kind of decisions be taken every time public opinion fluctuates right below or above the 50% line? What if we make a new referendum next month and this time leave gets 49.7% of the vote? Do we redo all the work again because a bunch of people changed their mind?\n\nIf you ask me, important decisions like Brexit should need a supermajority (66%+, and similarly a 66%+ majority to revert back).",

So, if that's really an argument, then it's an argument against democracy in general, not Brexit in particular.\n\nBut I don't think people need to know all the implications and ramifications of every decision they take. I think Britons have a right to decide if they want to be part of the EU or not. Politicians are the ones whose job is to transform the will of the people into actual action: in this case, they are the ones responsible for carrying out the will of the people (leaving the EU) in the best way possible.",

There were no eurosceptics or ERG members willing to take Cameron's poison chalice and that \"honor\" then fell on Theresa May, a remainer who still was determined to \"get brexit done\". On of the first things they did was trigger the leaving process in the form of article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. \n\nTheresa May started a timer when on 29th of march 2017 they officially notified EU of activating article 50. They didnt stay \"in a stalemate with the EU in a \"permanently leaving\" state\" they pissed away the two years of negotiating time and at then end of which May's deal suffered the worst defeat in the UK parliament ever. They managed to secure extra negotiating time and BoJo somehoe finalised their \"oven ready deal\", won thr elections and lead UK out of the EU. Uk has not been in the EU since 31st of January 2020. Northern Kreland is somewhat of a seperate issue but that has more to do with Belfast agreement, an agreement UK citizen didnt vote to leave so not really directly to do with brexit although the treaty was made between and assumed the parties being EU countries. \n\nFunny you chose this sub to talk about \"permanently leaving states\" and \"no rule on when to leave\" when after triggering article 50 neither of those were true. At least unilaterally on UK side.",

We say that America was a democracy since its conception, but in reality less than 1% of all the people in America had a right to vote, since (iirc) you were required to be a male, adult, white and own some land. Claiming that George Washington was elected democratically, when it was elected by 1.8% of the American population (43,782 people voted out of 3 million inhabitants), or that the Constitution was approved in a democratic process, is outright wrong. It makes people think that a majority of people supported these things, when in reality the vast majority of people simply didn't have a say on these topics.",

All interesting plots and written expressions of art have some sort of political view that their creator observes the world.\n\nThe problem is that you can have good and bad scripts. Classic Star Trek was a political and awesome joyride of emotions in a multitude of ways that people didn't focus only at that.\n\nThe new one (say Discovery) is a messy branch, with a script probably being adapted by a corporate HR induction video, shitting at what stark trek lovers enjoy most, Sci-fi and space exploration. So with nothing going on for it, it is easy to point at the politics and blame it for ruining it.\n\nAs further proof we can use the  \"The expanse\" . Extremely political yet an awesome Sci-fi adaptation, a modern version of what Star Trek used to be in the 70s. Nobody complains that it is \"too political\"",

A couple of bad episodes or unbelievable character behaviours will be forgiven and forgotten.\n\nIf a show is focused more on character development then you accept a sequential type of writing where each episode is linked and the environment is the background the characters evolve. \n\nWhen you do the latter and the writing is incoherent or lazy it fails miserably. Then the internet picks it up and you have a perfect shit storm.\n\nApologies for the rant, I just cannot believe that The Orville does better Star Trek nowadays.",

A YouTube interview of his opinions aren't a good citeable source -- as an overeducated, old, politically independent curmudgeon who finds the current GOP contemptible and don't think much of Democrats either, I hold myself to a high standard and try to do the same for others who want to engage.

At the time TOS ran, opposing communism was only slightly more \"political\" than opposing slavery.  In a sense, it wasn't really seeking to make an argument beyond what would be taught in elementary school. \n\n2. I think global-scale conflicts for the fate of humankind are very relevant to the Star Trek universe. That could be the post 9-11 culture, homelessness / economic inequality, the cold war, slavery and discrimination, or the old saw they're always on about \"war, what is it good for?\" The whole Federation project (as seen from the eyes of a TNG/DS9 era fan) is pretty much about a universal UN.  \n\nMaking a villain of ICE is unmistakably a very narrow-scope, partisan, American thing. I'm mostly in agreement with the anti-ICE crowd, but delving into a specific, current American political issue so precisely, and with so little nuance felt like purely like a stunt.",

                  "text": "A lot of the characters in season 1 of Picard were broken people beginning to put themselves back together. \n\nPicard was, in his own words, waiting to die after giving up.  \nRaffi either left, was forced out of, or discharged from Starfleet after Jean-Luc resigned unexpectedly. At the time the former lt. cmdr. and Starfleet parted, she suspected Romulan involvement in the attack on Mars, which then became an obsession that caused her to neglect her family (you learn two episodes later that her son cut contact with her). For her, JL resigning was the turning point in her life where she lost her career and then her family and her purpose. So obviously she's going to be a bit hostile to him.  \n\nIf your first two paragraph-sentences are meant to show contradiction to justify the third, I don't agree that they do. If you assume that Earth has moved beyond poverty or scarcity, you see that it's almost solely Raffi's choices that keep her where she is.  \nIf anyone has access to advanced technology like replicators or fabricators, Raffi included, she could have chosen to build a bigger or better house, or cultivate the land. If it was solely about where JL lived in relation to where she did, she could have moved anywhere offworld: to another developed area or a colony, or found her own. But it's not about that. It's just general resentment. It's showing Raffi had a not-uncommon, understandable, but absolutely piss-poor reaction to an unexpected personal crisis, not unlike Picard did, but their positions were not at all the same.\n\nPicard was old as balls, having served most of his life in Starfleet when he resigned, with inherited land worked by his family while he served (and later Romulans after the supernova) to retire in. But his resignation utterly torpedoed Raffi's career really early. And she had no plans at all besides the work she was doing in Starfleet. In a sense neither did Picard but if his actions cause him to leave Starfleet he has no-one to blame but himself and, again, he's ancient.  \n\nAlso, aside from Joseph Sisko and Robert Picard, do you ever really see what life is like on Earth from a non-Starfleet perspective?",

The majority of trekkies who hate it are dismissed as racist, when in reality it's just because the shows are flat out bad and untrue to the legacy and spirit of what came before.\n\nTo the point at hand; Tbh I cant really fault Shatners response here; to him, his version of the show WAS social commentary, that's just how the issues TOS tackled were framed back then. Kissing Uhura was a comment on society advancing apast racism, it wasnt political; it spoke to systemic societal issues that humanity had evolved from. The line blurs alot because society frames politics and vice versa, but I think Shatners point is worth considering. It wasnt political to kiss a black woman on TV, there were no laws or parties running on gender purity. There were (and still are) absolutely members of society who viewed race mixing as unacceptable, but this is more due to societal norms and the culture those people live in, not the politics of the day. The fight for racial equality took place on many battlefields, including the political, but I would argue it was societal first and foremost.",

Let me help you out in understanding why. \n\nFirst, stating \"white men, and to a lesser extent women...\", This is because the content you are consuming is coming from the west which is primarily white. If you went to Japan or somewhere else, then the content would be almost exclusively non-white. Statistics actually show that \"minorities\" are actually overrepresented within western media when compared to the demographics. \n\nTo your second point. People have no issue with a \"minority\" in a starring role. That in itself is not a problem. It depends however on what the content is, and that goes in all directions regardless of race or gender. For example, in the new Wakanda Forever Black Panther film, the main character shouldn't be white. Because that is what the story should be. It would be ludicrous for Black Panther or Blade to star a white character. That would be whitewashing. On the flip side though, a character like James Bond is a white character, yet everybody is shouting for it to be Idris Elba, who isn't white. In my eyes, that is also unacceptable, just as much as a white Black Panther. \n\nSo it's not a case of anything specific, but rather a cas-by-case situation.",

Minorities and women can kick ass, and they can do awesome adventury things.\n\nBlack Panther is fundamentally a story about Afrofuturism, and is a representative of an Africa country, populated by people from Africa. Black Panther is a character meant to fight for the rights of Africans. His kinds of stories are fundamentally related to race, so it wouldn't work.  \nCan you see the difference? \n\nAnd, on a fundamental level, what is a story? A story is a collection of words and/or images meant to convey a series of events for ether the entertainment or education of an individual or group. Stories do not exist in a vacuum. They are made by people with views and biases. And they are consumed by individuals with biases and views.  And it is the fundamental nature of stories to change and evolve from generation to generation, as the groups that make and consume stories develop different tastes. Compare, for example, the Batman movies from the 60s and 70s, to the more recent Batman films of the 21st century. See the evolution of what audiences want?\n\nAs we, as a country (Assuming you're an American) grow more diverse, of course people want to see more diversity in the media they consume! Can it be tacky or lazily executed? Absolutely, but lazy execution is much more a problem with executives or those working on a project screwing up and applies to all forms of media, irregardless of a cast. There are very few fundamentally bad story *concepts*, but there are a million ways to execute it poorly. Compare a good WWII FPS and a bad WWII FPS. It's the same basic concept, \"Shoot Nazis in the face with vast arsenals.\" But the differences come in how it's executed. \n\nNow, in regards to the James Bond, I can also agree to that it's a generally typically male role, but I think the idea of the intent behind making the next Bond potentally a women as some secret, \"ah yes, let us remove all the Whites!\", but instead is a simple expression of people wanting to have a kickass action franchise to finally embrace the fact that anyone can be a kickass hero; not just white men. I don't think it's malicious at all. Would it be more ideal if they create their own film? Yes! But simply put, executives are lazy and do not like singing on to ideas that pose a risk. It's much safter, from a production standpoint, to sign off on using an established IP, and changing elements of it to fit the new idea, to tell the same kind of story. Most obvious example of this: Star Trek. Each series is essentially the exact same basic premise: space socialists go around the universe and solve its problems, but each rendition has its own interpretations on what that state the crew originates from is like, and it has different takes on how the characters would deal with similar circumstances. They could have created whole new universes for each \"generation\", but they kept it all within the same brand name.",

To do so would change the character and therefore no longer would they be James Bond. To do so would be sexist/racist. It wasn't a question of what women/minorities are capable of doing. It's about protecting the character. \n\nCan I see the difference? All I see is your mental gymnastics to change white characters while defending non-white ones. It's hypocritical. Using your own statement; James Bond is a Brit protecting British people. Just as much connected to race as black panther. \n\nAlso, no I'm not American. Which is why I'm less brainwashed by American politics. Regarding the whole \"people want to see diversity\", no. People don't care. What they want to see is good content. What they hate seeing is political propaganda/ American identity politics. It's just racist Tokenism. Most of the world moved past it decades ago, America, like with all their politics, is dragging the world back down again. Imagine, being so offended by white people in an English story, that you had to change the entire lore of the literature in order to push your multi-ethnic cultures. It's funny. America claims to be a melding pot, yet is by far the most regressive place in the west with regards to race or gender.",

Look at the new Game of Thrones prequel. They deliberately cast a black person as a Targaeryan. Not because of the lore, but they deliberately said that they didn't want to see a bunch of white people on the screen all the time. \n\nIt's simple. Make a good story. Make good content  Race and gender are irrelevant to this. Always has and always will be. Filling it with identity politics will only ruin it.

Latinum allegedly can't be replicated, and as it's a liquid metal at room temperature, it's usually encased (\"pressed\") in gold-foam bars of various sizes/denominations. Bio-mimetic gel is mentioned a few times as something hard to create, dangerous to handle, and highly restricted. Dilithium, which you mentioned, can't exactly be replicated but it can be recrystallized with some tech and effort. Similarly, antimatter must typically be collected by tankers to refuel starships, as the tech they have for generating antimatter is apparently very energy-intensive and only to be used in emergencies. It's difficult to even use a transporter with antimatter. It has to either be in a special storage pod or the transporter buffer and other components must be changed.",

I have brought up that episode (\"Author, Author\") before in [a different conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/vv4bvz/the_us_copyright_office_on_june_29_2022_rejected/ifihjav/), one about copyright specifically.\n\nThe EMH mark ones toiling in the (pretty sure they were) dilithium mines doesn't sit well with a lot of Star Trek fans like me, partly because of the implication of the enslavement of sentient holograms, and partly because ***don't they have better mining methods???*** Why the hell are holograms basically using pickaxes and rail carts to mine ore? It makes about as much sense as Paris and Janeway turning into salamanders after going at warp 10.\n\nAnyway, the relevant bits in \"Author, Author\" to what you're saying... I think it's worth clarifying (I'm not trying to contradict you, just add information) that The Doctor had entered into a contractual arrangement with a publishing company *while* actively working on his holonovel, *Photons be Free*. He did take his crewmates' criticism seriously (eventually) and continued revising the holonovel, but the publisher decided to distribute the rough draft without The Doctor's permission. And the arbitrator decided that, while he can't declare The Doctor a *person* within the scope of that arbitration, he did find that The Doctor can legally count as an *artist*. But whether that is under the scope of Federation law and intellectual property rights or if it's just limited to the contract between The Doctor and the publisher is unclear. It's also left unclear whether the version of *Photons be Free* that the holographic miners have access to is the rough draft or the final copy, so I'd hesitate to claim that it was \"pirated\".\n\nDefinitely still got issues with *Picard*, too, don't get me started...",

It might be easier to set up holographic emitters than set up a breathable environment. So assuming that was the case, why not have, I don't know, holographic mining equipment that was fully automated?!\n\nThe only answer I could think of is that they were mining something rare and delicate.  So maybe they were mining something that had the structural integrity of cotton candy so it had to be done by hand.\n\nBut since they never explain it, I had the same question as you.\n\nIt was a dumb plot point and they could have made it better.\n\nAnyway, we've gone way past the point. The point is that the writers and show runners of Star Trek have certainly used their show to highlight and make commentary about issues in society.",

There was also the Maquis, and Chakote's tribe, and occasional final survivors or lost ship descendants.\n\nGenerally the non-UFP Terrans only appeared or were mentioned in episodes where them being so was integral to the plot, usually as an allegory for expats, refugees, colonisation, land rights, etc.",

Capitalism is still present, it's just a minor and mostly-irrelevant practice within the UFP itself, good for treating yourself or others to vanity/special items and services, but not the all-pervading sickness of today.

And as every business needs to be industrialised today, just saying \"market system with private enterprises\" is a sufficienty definition and explanation.",

Especially in germany the business growth was financed through Banking, with growth snowballing because of incresing revenue. Thats how all business functioned, the reliance on Investors is a new concept, so there is no reason why big business cant grow in the same way it did historically. It might take a bit longer but there is no historical reason why it would be impossebil.",

Thats mostly because the first comment I answered to mentioned \"employees\", which I feel requiers a bit of a bigger startup. Now, when we go by that point we need to come to the second conclusion: If you have a business with employees (multiple) you probably need a bit more money than what most people have at hand.\n\nAnd thats more or less the points I tried to make: If we think of a system which has privately owned business with employees, calling that system \"Communist\" is probably very wrong. I really dont get that point at all, in this case we clearly have a capitalist and a worker. The second part that we then talked about, I tried to say that you probably need some kind of money generation up front to start a business of some kind of size (were you have employees, and produce some stuff). I think that reasonable, but again, our personal experiences seem to differ here, and I dont have data at hand.\n\n>Free market competition is healthier without the mega corps of capitalism!!\n\nWell yeah, I dont think anybody disagrees with that on a basic level, though there are some grievances like \"Economy of Scale\" were we just waste resources if we keep everything ultra small. So by my standard: Let them grow as big as they want, as long as competition does not suffer severely.",

But rather a society where the needs of the People are able to be met, easily.\n\nWiki:\nPost-scarcity does not mean that scarcity has been eliminated for all goods and services, but that all people can easily have their basic survival needs met along with some significant proportion of their desires for goods and services.\n\nAnd the very idea of communism is that peoples needs are filled, regardless of the value that the individual may or may not produce to society. Its pretty much its fundamental belief.\nWhat Karl Marx believed is that Communism is a future ideology, where society lives under the proletariat dictatorship, Up untill post-scarcity society is achieved. And Then, disband all pretence of goverment, as it no longer is needed. Naturally money in such a society becomes pointless. But if money exists, it may be impossible to achieve such a society as you dont want People to 3d print whatever they want in their own house. Thereby the existence of money might counter act it and even prevent it.\n\nThe push of a button thing I mentioned is just a literall and crude translation by my part. But the core idea is true.\n\nEdit: I Also want to make it very clear that I am No expert by any means in the subject. I studied it during My teenage Years, and Karl Marx has written a lot of books. So I am pretty much just spit balling from memory that I have cirka 13 Years ago.",

It\u2019s generally depicted as being a post-hierarchical world in a broad sense but there are still holdover hierarchical elements from modern day society. It\u2019s not communist by any exacting definition but if I had to pick any major modern political descriptor for that depiction of society it is certainly much closer to some sort of socialism than anything else I could think of. Especially post Cold War Star Trek like DS9 where they really delve into depictions of hyper capitalist society with Feringinar the contrast makes the social criticism a lot more visible.",

You might point out some in-name-only technicalities like \"the means of production is privately owned, even though by virtue of being post-scarcity every good is effectively distributed freely.\" But you're describing a situation where the distinction for \"privately-owned\" becomes meaningless -- there isn't really any point to maintaining private ownership of the means of production in a world where everyone has access to everything anyway, as I believe you'd agree. And if it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, it's a duck.\n\nYou even point out that there'd be little point in keeping an oppressive order in a post-scarcity world. Well, yeah, when Marx describes a classless and stateless society with free distribution of abundant goods made by automation with no material need for human labor, that's what he means. That's what a communist society is.\n\nMy point with the post-scarcity dystopia is that you could hypothetically have a \"post-scarcity\" society that was not definitely not communist. But it would be firmly against the principles you describe for post-scarcity, because post-scarcity principles are pretty Marxist in nature.",

Violence being power that limits another's options.\n\nOn some level, almost everything is political to some degree, but there is a distinction between naturally political and deliberately political. Star trek is deliberately political. It goes out of its way to adress issues that involve the range of options of various groups. For example, star trek championed civil rights, and rights of any kind are political.\n\nI think a better question than \"is this political?\", in which case the answer is almost always yes, is \"how is this political?\", which has much more interesting answers.",

It's like some insane incels created religions that shame anything sexual because they couldn't find anyone who would bang them.",

One can only imagine at this point what the rebuilding from the Dominion War, the widespread adoption of holographic and android workers, and the far-reaching consequences of the Hobus Supernova would have on the Federation's economy and ideals. \n\nI mean, we literally have to imagine it. Nemesis, Star Trek (2009 movie) and Picard basically ignore the state of Earth in that era, other than a few scenes in the beginning of Picard seasons. We only see the things that directly impact Picard and his closest allies in that show, but never any indication of what the rest of the world/Federation is like. \n\nI would love an actual series, but I think Paramount has given up at this point. Discovery launched itself to the 32nd century, SNW is pre-TOS, and Lower Decks gives us only a comedic look at the decade before Picard. Meanwhile Prodigy is pretty time ambiguous so far, we mostly know it's *sometime* after Voyager. Maybe we'll get some better commentary out of Lower Decks at some point, but it seems pretty focused on the Starfleet angle more than societal.",

Raffi's drinking herself to death in the desert from lack of purpose was entirely compatible with a utopia where people are supposed to make their own purpose, for example.  A society-wide struggle for meaning can be interesting (maybe a new religion suddenly comes into vogue).\n\nAll we ever really see in depth is Starfleet: which represent the most dedicated and capable people in the Federation, and a string of colonists (who are almost universally ambitious and over-eager).  I'd like to see what it's like for the 24th century slackers and burn-outs.  The circumstances of civilization can change, but human nature is more complicated.\n\nI'll agree that the way Picard in particular depicted the galaxy outside of Starfleet regulations was basically just a generic sci-fi setting of smugglers and bars (like knock-off Expanse or Killjoys or something).",

Raffi isn\u2019t just suffering from lack of purpose, she\u2019s also specifically lamenting having to live in a shanty while Picard lives in a fancy inherited estate. \n\nThat particular form of inequality was not-subtly stated to be *over* on Earth and in Starfleet space. When Starfleet members prior to the Picard show go back to the 21st century and see the widespread poverty, it\u2019s a shock to them, they wonder how it ever even worked that way.\n\nI don\u2019t actually know that modern writers are even *capable* of imagining an optimistic future, let alone then coming up with problems humans could still face in that future. We have been nonstop drowned with dystopian fiction in every form of media for like seventy years or longer. Dramatic stories set in hopeful futures like Star Trek have been the exception in most of that time, and even Star Trek\u2019s been mostly an action franchise since the \u201890s.",

If two people live in an apartment, and there are two bathrooms, then both have what I call freedom of the bathroom, go to the bathroom any time you want, and stay as long as you want to for whatever you need. And this to my way is ideal. And everyone believes in the freedom of the bathroom. It should be right there in the Constitution. But if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it. As you put more and more people onto the world, the value of life not only declines, but it disappears. It doesn't matter if someone dies.\"",

No sci-fi extra planet, literally talking about our history. Same show that dealt with sexual consent. Same show that dealt with human rights.\n\nIt's wild to me how people can be \"fans of Star Trek\" and completely miss the episodes that deal with race, gender, sexuality, consent, etc. Star Trek (until Discovery...) has consistently dealt with \"woke\" ideas. It doesn't always hit the mark (Code of Honor, eh), but it always dealt with \"stupid liberal ideas\".",

Captain Maxwell is highly traumatized and suspicious - and the question whether he may have been right or not, whether his feelings and / or his actions may have been right or not - all these are extremely political questions. I as a TV watcher see this plot automatically on the backdrop of actual history, actual modern societies and my personal reading sees a lot of German-French relationship in that episode. That is my *personal* political reading, nobody has to share it. But I will gladly explain why this episode is highly political for me. \n\nAt the end it turns out that nothing is clear, maybe the Cardassians that were attacked conspired against the new peace treaty - or maybe Maxwell slaughtered innocent people. how you react and how you discuss this plot is super political. It is not just \"wow shooty bang bang with new alien race\" and it really undersells Star Trek in particular and Sci fi in general. MAybe ther should never have been a peace treaty with the Cardassians? Maybe the Cardassians ought not be trusted, even if trust and peace are part of our political ideals? Maybe France should've invaded Germany in 1936 after the remilitarization of the Rhineland? Maybe we should have kept star fleet vessels all the way down to Cardassia to make sure these fuckers don't get funny ideas. It would have cost lives but who knows - we may have avoided the Dominion war, would we not have?",

A topic is political when it touches on how society, culture, politics, government and such should be sturctured, changed or fought. (very broadly). Or when it touches on topics that are important in politics. \n\nStar Trek does have more than just \"We should have this or that value instead of what we have now\". Like for example: I am not very fond of DS9. I liked Voyager and Next Generation much more. But about DS9: I was born in 1990, i never watched DS9 when it was new but rather in the late nineties and early 2000s and alongside the Cardassian plot points I found very interesting how (I think) one can draw pretty interesting parallels between the history of the nineties and the \"history\" of Cardassia. They are a once big empire, still built on tradition, militarism, pride in the good all days, a society that survived a social cataclysm after its violent emoire broke apart and yet, even though they have social issues, they have hunger in the streets, Cardassia still puts its energy into keeping its military up. They have violent history, horrible things done by Cardassian scientists and officers, but it can not be admitted, because it would mean admitting moral failures. And even though Cardassia hat to give up its colonies and conquered \"lands\" due to them just not being able to hold onto them, they eye at them all the time, ever so envious, ready to take it back. \n\nCardassia is Germany during inter war periods; it is Russia after the breakaway of the Soviet Union and Serbia after the breaking apart of Yugoslavia. Bajor is the Sudetenland and the Saarland; it is chechnya and Gorgia and Kosovo. Once I looked at it that way I never thought of the Cardassians as \"dumbed down Klingons for a new Series\" because as a faction with their own history and politics they have much more merrit to be in a sci fi show. And these parallels drawn make it so much better - but they are political, they are not really \"social\", are they? \n\nAnd with all that in my head, the last thing I can not wrap my head around it, is: Is the Maquis freedom fighters? Or are they terrorists? And does it make a difference if you have witnessed the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan or just 9/11?",

At no point does Miura imply that monarchy is inherently corrupt or tyrannical, it just presents an instance of a corrupt monarchy. That's the same for his depiction of religion and christianity. He portrays overzealous characters committing horrible acts of torture in the name of religion, but does Miura at any point takes an overtly anti-religious stance ? Not really, it's just one instance of a religion in a believable context and universe. At no point does he outright implies that he thinks religion is evil or undesirable. Mind you, maybe that's what he actually thinks, but that's not the point.\n\nSo you see it has nothing to do with whatever values or beliefs the creators personally uphold. When people like you say \"You just don't agree with what they believe in\", you're just sidestepping the whole argument. The crux of the issue would be that i don't even want to know what politics they believe in, except if that's specifically why i engage in their work (ie i'm seeking to read or watch a political piece).\n\nFor a blatantly politicised media, try the boys for example, from the top of my head, and pretty much any netflix original series, or most modern western media in general.",

A topic is political when it touches on how society, culture, politics, government and such should be sturctured, changed or fought. (very broadly). Or when it touches on topics that are important in politics.\r  \n\r  \nStar Trek does have more than just \"We should have this or that value instead of what we have now\". Like for example: I am not very fond of DS9. I liked Voyager and Next Generation much more. But about DS9: I was born in 1990, i never watched DS9 when it was new but rather in the late nineties and early 2000s and alongside the Cardassian plot points I found very interesting how (I think) one can draw pretty interesting parallels between the history of the nineties and the \"history\" of Cardassia. They are a once big empire, still built on tradition, militarism, pride in the good all days, a society that survived a social cataclysm after its violent emoire broke apart and yet, even though they have social issues, they have hunger in the streets, Cardassia still puts its energy into keeping its military up. They have violent history, horrible things done by Cardassian scientists and officers, but it can not be admitted, because it would mean admitting moral failures. And even though Cardassia hat to give up its colonies and conquered \"lands\" due to them just not being able to hold onto them, they eye at them all the time, ever so envious, ready to take it back.\r  \n\r  \nCardassia is Germany during inter war periods; it is Russia after the breakaway of the Soviet Union and Serbia after the breaking apart of Yugoslavia. Bajor is the Sudetenland and the Saarland; it is chechnya and Gorgia and Kosovo. Once I looked at it that way I never thought of the Cardassians as \"dumbed down Klingons for a new Series\" because as a faction with their own history and politics they have much more merrit to be in a sci fi show. And these parallels drawn make it so much better - but they are political, they are not really \"social\", are they?\r  \n\r  \nAnd with all that in my head, the last thing I can not wrap my head around it, is: Is the Maquis freedom fighters? Or are they terrorists? And does it make a difference if you have witnessed the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan or just 9/11?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr, another exmaple: Is The existence od section 31 a good thing? A bad thing? Necessery or evil? This is not just a \"social commentary\"., it is ellbow deep into politics - and imagine that section 31 was written up *before* the patriot act and some such. Discussing that will force anyone to bring their politics on the table or else a question like that can not be discussed. \n\nStar Trek is much more political.",

We don\u2019t get a lot of insight into partisan politics in the series, or how the Federation of governed.\n\nI dunno, human rights *shouldn\u2019t* be a part of the world of politics, they should be a given. Shatner\u2019s tone-deaf here for sure, though I see what he\u2019s saying.",

It's ironic because the example  that OP posted is much more \"ETHICAL\" than \"POLITICAL\". I would argue that traditional Star Trek really didn't have any relevance to its modern day political parties or Measures, Bills, politicians, etc. In fact, it was an optimistic telling of a potential future for humanity if we DIDN'T use concepts like politics to divide the human race but rather worked more cooperatively towards a common goal while also allowing personal freedoms. It may sound pedantic claiming a difference between ethics/values and politics, but if you consider any stance on ethics/values to be political then it is a pretty slippery slope and then you can consider most opinions to be \"political\". Ironically, the newest Star Trek shows removes a lot of the optimism of humanity's future. \nBut yeah, having the correct context really helps understand what Shatner is trying to say here.",

Would also share a lot of weird misinformation about the fandom when the show was still on without an ounce of remorse. Also remember watching American Pickers a few years ago with my Papaw and Shatner contacted them about remodeling parts of his house and the taller guy was diplomatic about how \u201cconfused\u201d Shatner was thinking they were interior decorators. Still ended up doing something for him and designing a room or his house or something for an episode. But the way that host was talking, Shatner really thought they were designers and could just redo his house. Viewing these actions through the lens of him possibly being an alcoholic makes a lot more sense.",

She goes from unlikeable to a good character, much like 'Asoka' from star wars - they take a character that doesn't work and give them a great path to growth. You go from hating her to sympathing with her struggles.\n\nI think you need to suspend your disbelief a bit in the vfx department and just try to focus on what it is, good stories about social issues in the same vein as og Star Trek",

They do treat the Borg Queen as a kind of deity, as well as forcibly indoctrinate the people who are assimilated into becoming Borg themselves with very little free will/autonomy.",

There is a distinction.\n\nAssimilation is not necessarily a Conservative act because the Communists would often assimilate people who would disagree or stand opposite to the state. It is a tool, not a Conservative modus operandi. \n\nConservatism, again, has more to do with wanting to uphold the cultural values and norms that they live within. The Borg are not interested in upholding any particular cultural values. The Borg, much like The Federation, have a fondness for other forms of life and culture. It is just that their fondness comes with a desire to possess rather than a desire to cooperate. This is not describing Conservatism, this is describing something else entirely. They have no attachment to culture whatsoever. many Conservatives however, they often care for the culture they exist within more-so than the lives of others. And often they dont' want to interfere witht he lives of others.",

          "text": "It does make some sense.  Star Trek can be viewed as putting on classic moral plays.   Stories that focus on what is Morally correct, regardless of current ethics or morays. \n\nThe fact that some moral questions have become entrenched in some countries politics is a separate problem.\n\nTake the Covid vaccine.   It's a moral imperative to take the vaccine, because it helps protect others around you, not just yourself.  The more people that are vaccinated, the better the herd immunity is.  It protects everyone.    It's a very easy moral situation, you do something small and it helps everyone.\n\nNow the Covid vaccine isn't political at all.  It's a tool against a virus... but assholes in some political groups have realized that there's a significant portion of the population that feels 'icky' about vaccines.   People that don't understand the science. \n\nSo what happens?  The POLITIANS make it political.\n\nAll social justice, all moral conclusion, all human thought can be MADE political.    Which is the point.  Most political stake holding is *downstream* of human thought devices.   Not much originates in politics, it's a reaction to thought.\n\nSo something being moral, is a far higher level than being political. \n\n So it's easy to think of Star Trek as moral stories.   If you watch them a 100 years from now, in a different country, there's a good chance you won't think they're political, because they exist on a better level.  They're good values based on well reasoned morals.",

Nobody would think it's a political show talking about politics in the 60s. That's Shatner's point, probably. They may have brought up topics that would be of interest of politicians, maybe, but not really central to their goal.\n\nBut *today* the topic of race and culture are so intertwined with actual politics (governance), it will automatically spark discussion of politics. \"Identity politics\" are one of the main splintering aspects of today's political groups.

The episode show is about racism but instead of just throwing in mixed characters for #corporate diversity. They symbolized it using fiction to tell the truth and I think that is a lot more meaningful and interesting. It makes you look at things from an alien/outside perspective so you can better understand the issues involved without bias and that is a lot more impactful.",

You sometimes pause in weird places while the person changes cue cards.\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that John Wayne's very weird cadence is that exact same thing.  He starts a sentence one way, they switch cards mid sentence and he realizes mid sentence that he needs to change the tone and delivery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt always struck me as really silly that Shatner and John Wayne are put on a pedestal when I'm about 90% sure that bizarre delivery comes from not being able to remember lines and needing cue cards.",

      "text": "I'm willing to play devils advocate for a few moments here and just say that I've met people who hate new trek for being too political but love old trek and agree with many of the messages in each episode. \n\nYet many of those messages are, themselves, political, and most can still be applied to modern day, not just the 60s of TOS, for instance. So what, exactly, is different? Are these friends of mine, who I know are NOT super conservative or super liberal but are generally left-leaning, somehow hating on the left-leaning messages of newer trek, or, indeed, most mainstream sci fi? \n\nNo, I'd argue that it's a matter of being preached to. It's the difference between a story that makes you think about the issue it's alluding to and allow you to agree or disagree with the message itself without ruining your enjoyment if you disagree, and a story that basically tells you what to think about a situation. It's the difference between Aesop's fables and just telling you the life lesson in the most hamfisted way possible. It's the difference between a message integrated into a story and a story integrated into a message. It's the difference between \"hey, maybe this is a better way to do what you're doing,\" vs \"the other people are complete idiots and only the main character is right. Anyone who agrees is right, anyone who disagrees is, essentially, an enemy.\" \n\nAnd before anyone says \"but it had very blatantly political aspects to it. What about the first interracial kiss?\" Yes, but that was one part of an episode that, from what I remember, wasn't specifically about \"hey, interracial couples are totally fine.\" It was just a thing that happened, within the story of the show, and I don't remember anyone within the show making a big deal of it. Which, I think, sends a much stronger pro-love statement than a speech from the captain about why the interracial kiss was a thing because it implied that any reservations about the interracial stuff is an archaic thing of the past. Yes, there were many blatant political statements made in moments, but the overall structure of the show was more \"aesop's fable\" than \"cold war propaganda posters\". \n\nTo give an example, if old trek wanted to make a pro-gun control statement,  they might show an alien world that created sentient weapons that got out of control and have kirk deal with that, showing the dangers of unrestrained weapon production and distribution, or they may show a colony that refuses to give up their phasers for seemingly very good reasons (but it's causing some sort of problem or political tension or something), and have Picard show them a better way. Modern trek, or other shows, would likely just show the anti-gun control people as an unhinged sociopathic group that loves violence and can't formulate an intelligent argument besides \"me like gun it go boom\", while the pro gun legislation people are very intelligent, even-tempered, and reasonable paragons of order. Even though I'm certainly not a \"we should sell RPGs at wal-mart guy\", I'd reject the latter on principle while embracing the former. \n\nI'm not saying shows with political messages on either side are inherently bad, but at least make us think a bit. Make me have to come to the conclusion of the message on my own rather than just telling me what to think about an issue with no Grey areas.",

I mean they even cast the president of earth as a currently sitting senator, and Picard had a whole episode bashing ICE.. it's borderline propaganda.

It was political in that sense within its own framework because Star Fleet had to have political relationships with races from outside itself, and it was political in the subtextual sense because different races were allegories for different political entities - Klingons were originally Soviet allegories, and Romulans allegories for the Chinese, for example. \n\nIt was also political in the wider sense of using its pseudo-utopian society to comment on the society of the time. For example, from the second series Roddenberry deliberately included a Russian on the bridge to show that in the future the Cold War would be over.\n\nNo matter which definition of \"political\" you use, the show was political from the start, and very deliberately so.",

Then proceed to define it your way, which includes race, civil rights, war, and the entire concept of Star Trek as \"political\". So now you've tried to replace an overly broad definition, with another overly broad definition.. I don't see that as progress. Why then bother to describe anything as \"political\"? It would mean nothing.  \n\n\nYou, and others, are extending the definition of political from its core, the control of mainstream thinking for the purpose of gaining certain outcomes, with everything that it is connected to. Which is literally everything.  \nPromoting a sitting senator, as well as actively bashing a current government organisation, is not some commentary, that is actively participating in politics, and \"political\". If you want to equate that to some passing commentaries of human issues, that's up to you, but those are completely different to me. And pretty obvious (to me) what Shatner meant.",

He\u2019s an ACTOR, I don\u2019t watch trek but I\u2019m sure for any show- 9 out of 10 times a team of people write a show, there\u2019s a director, people have visions and then you HIRE actors to ACT out the script with its message. The actors are getting a check for the most part, not there to be your social progress markers, and I would especially assume not Shatner. Get involved in actual activism, don\u2019t look to actors for how to feel about the way people are treated. Even ancient Romans, with all their quirks and whatnot, knew actors are there to entertain, you don\u2019t base and build your hopes and dreams and beliefs and activism on them, Jesus H. Christ",
