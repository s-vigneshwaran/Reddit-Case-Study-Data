  "text": "Islam is a homophobic religion and I'm tired of pretending it's not.\nFor context's sake, I would like to clarify that I am a lesbian. Because of this I feel strongly about the topic of gay and lesbian rights.\n\nAs we've all known Islam is a hateful, homophobic and sexist religion at its core, but we have to pretend it's not for the sake of appearing woke. I'm as left-leaning as the next person but denying these truths about Islam is just plain stupid.\n\nI'm tired of pretending that I should tolerate Islam's existence for the sake of respecting opinions when this religion literally wants me dead just on the basis of being a lesbian. I've seen more progressive western Muslims try to say stuff like \"Oh, that's just a vocal minority!\" or \"That's just old Islam! We don't actually believe that!\" When if you go into the comment section of literally any Muslim video discussing gay men and lesbians, the comments tell us how disgusting we are and how we should be dead.\n\nIt's one thing to believe in a modernized version of your religion, it's another to completely deny the roots of it, though.",

Society benefits by having one less hateful person in it especially when the hate is directed towards random people that have never did you wrong. The victim benefits because as Bob Ross said \"I can't afford to hate. I don't have that sort of time\", it's a pretty sad existence choosing to live a hateful life\n\n>There\u2019s nothing that says forgiveness helps people who were hurt\n\nYou should probably reread it because it definitely does.\n\n\nIn the end I can't imagine caring that much about someone that hurt you, it must be pretty sad dedicating that much energy and time to someone that probably doesn't even think about you",

Buddist is Shr Lanka were enacting violence against the local muslim population at the behest of the state.  You do realize your on an athiest subreddit.  Non of us hold water for any religion. They are all fake and used as a means of enacting political will.  Organized or not.  And sometimes that political will is peacful but you get enough bad actors in enough postions of power you got your self a new sect that is totally okay with being violent.  Even buddhisim. It just so happens that they havent directed that violence towards the LGBTQ community yet.",

Similar rights were not available to women in Europe for many centuries after the advent of Islam. For example Allah SWT mentions in the Quran the intellectual and spiritual equality of men and woman.\n\nTo find verses about the spiritual equality of men and women, look up these:\n\nQuran: 4:124 , 33:35 , 57:12 , 16:97\n\nIntellectual status:\n\nOn the intellectual level Islam stresses that education is equally important for men and women. The Holy Prophet(saw) said:\n\n\u2018It is the duty of every Muslim man and every Muslim woman to acquire knowledge\u2019 (Ibne Majah).\n\nAlso, Islam gave women the right to an education over 1500 years ago. In contrast, it was not until 1886 that women were permitted to sit exams at Cambridge University and it was not until 1948 that the university would confer academic degrees on them. Women were first admitted to Oxford University in 1920.\n\nAnd don't say anything about inheritance, the only reason women are worth less inheritance in Islam is because in the Muslim house, it's the duty of the man to provide for the woman, and not just in the context of husband and wife, a man HAS to provide for his mother and sister for example. So even if women don't get inheritance at all -which they do- they will still be provided for.",

This was only banned in my country last year and there were people who strongly opposed it.  Which brings me to my point.\n\nYes, sure, homosexuality isn't a crime anymore.  And same sex marriage is legal.  (Though these dates are perhaps more recent than people would like to remember).  But people are still incredibly hateful.  They label LGBT+ people as sexual predators and, yes, even advocate that they ought to be killed.  I live on the same street as a church that literally preaches such views.  We have police willing to turn a blind eye to LGBT+ victims.  Like the serial killings in Toronto where the killings went on because the police didn't give a shit about LGBT+ victims.\n\nLiterally the difference is the formal law.  And that's not nothing, but let's not kid ourselves, the problem is not a single religion.  It's all of them being used by hateful people.  And it's other people being willing to tolerate it because \"it's their right\".",

In these cases the silence equates to acquiescence of that sort of troubling behaviour. You can see the person above they're trying to talk to has no interest in expressing solidarity with the marginalized people within their society. All that matters is defense of religion.

Its all a myth anyway. If they choose to believe a more humane and kind version of their myth, why tell them that they are a hypocrite and reading the religious text wrong. \n\nThe person above said that the people that hate on Islam the most are the ex-muslims that are raised by the most ass-backwards people. Which is true. If you're raised around shitty people being shitty because of religion, you're going to have a very sour view of that religion. \n\nIf you're raised around good people that have positive views of their religion and the people around them. Empathetic and more accepting interpretations of a text that in reality is far older than our current moral foundations. Of course you'll have a kinder interpretation of the religion.\n\nI am Arab. I know all kinds of families across the spectrum. I know one that kicked their son out for being gay, and another that still considers themselves Muslim but took that same son in as their own and are now paying for his wedding at their mosque officiated by their Imam. \n\nWe need less of the first and more of the second. Obviously there's a third option of \"no religion\" but in a world where people will believe and will grow up according to their environment, its about welcoming those the best we can that are better than their history and stamping down those that put down others.",

Most animals that live in bands have well codified rules on how and when violence can occur. Do you think \"uncivilized\" people were idiots, and would not have reacted to you bashing Gr\u00fcd\u00fck in the face and taking his stuff ?\n\nThe idea that \"religion was invented to exert control over the population\" is completely backwards. Religion in its simplest form has existed for ~300K years, and for ~40K years in a form that we'd recognize today. And yet \"civilization\" is at most 10K years old. This means that for 99% of human history, we had a million religions that were not related to the consolidation of power.\n\nAlso the link between homophobia and religion is really tenuous. If you take most civilizations where homosexuality was frowned upon, that rejection was not prescribed or enforced by any church. It was a cultural thing, but not something the priests would care much about. We have that image that the further you go back in time, the more homophobic cultures become, but it's a big clich\u00e9. Even the Catholic church didn't start caring about that until the 15th or 16th century, so in all likelihood a priest from rural 1200s England would be a lot more tolerant than, say, an American evangelist from 2022.\n\nAnd that's not even mentioning how in most cultures throughout history, being gay was fine. It was not socially advantageous in the long run (no kids means you'll be less rich because no free workforce, no marriage means no enlarging your sphere of influence, also it means you're certainly not starting a family that could be big in 300 years) but you wouldn't be punished directly for it. The idea of the conservative society that goes out of its way to punish gay people is a very, very modern concept.",

(Like father his own kid with a 15 year old while he's like infinity. Gross.) So, she has a son, Isaac. Abe is over the moon. But now Sarah has her own kid, Hagar and Ish gotta go. They get shuffled off and Ishmael's kids eventually start Islam. In the meantime, god wants to make sure Abe is ride or die, so he tells Abe to sacrifice his son to god. Abe says you got it, builds an alter, sets his kid on it, and right when he's about to stick his son, god sends an angel to stop him and says psych!!! Kidding! Damn dog you're ride or die. Isaac's kids are gonna start Judaism! Much later, his great great great great great great great great great grandkid will marry a 15 year old named Mary and get cucked by god, and their kid Jesus will start Christianity. Yeah.

There, the evil ones skin turned brown (yeah) and they fought with the righteous ones. Around 33 CE, Jesus came to visit during those three days he was dead. Eventually the good guys got defeated and disappeared, but first they wrote down the history on 30-60 lb GolD Plates, in a language called \"reformed egyptian\". Then in the 1800s this guy Joseph Smith found the plates, and set them in a hat and, and using a seer stone. translated them to his bro. Later, the Angel Moroni took the plates back to Heaven. The LDS church owns Salt Lake City and has a $37.8 billion stock portfolio. Here's a review of the Book of Mormon from when it was published. \n\n> All men have heard of the Mormon Bible, but few except the \"elect\" have seen it, or, at least, taken the trouble to read it. I brought away a copy from Salt Lake. The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a pretentious affair, and yet so \"slow,\" so sleepy; such an insipid mess of inspiration. It is chloroform in print. If Joseph Smith composed this book, the act was a miracle \u2014 keeping awake while he did it was, at any rate.\n> Mark Twain",

Like for Christianity and Judaism (maybe Islam too, I can't pretend to know much about what is and isn't canon for them), the law of \"no man shall lay with another man as he lays with a woman\" was given in Leviticus, during the Jewish exile. This was likely a commandment of preservation, making sure that babies were made to keep their people alive in the time of strife. Many, MANY laws were given as ways to protect their population (the popular \"no mixed fabrics\" law was probably implemented to prevent heat exhaustion, for instance). Since religion was an integral part of the culture as a whole, it was codified as a \"divine law,\" and stuck.",

But most Quranists believe that these views came way later than the actual Quran and that's why Quranists don't accept the hadiths.\n\nOfcourse, a lot of western/modern people's views are still not in line with the Quran, but it does differ from regular islamism. For example, when u are are 'normal' islamist, listening to music is forbidden because of the hadiths. Quranism doesnt accept this because the information stems from Hadiths and not from the Quran.",

He invited the complex\u2019s security guards, plumbers and electricians to join.\n\nOver the course of seven months, they, too, raped and molested her, possibly dozens of times, using makeup to cover any marks they left on her, her sister said.\n\n\u201cShe was blackmailed on the edge of a pocketknife,\u201d the 11-year-old girl\u2019s sister, a university student, said in an interview.

Lawyers beat several of the men as they were curled up on the floor of a local courthouse.\n\nFrantic residents of the building where the girl lived organized round-the-clock shifts guarding the entrance.\n\nBut a few days later, the police stopped answering calls from reporters. Around Chennai, people blamed the mother. They erroneously said the girl, who wears hearing aids and acted younger than her age, was \u201cdeaf and dumb.\u201d They dismissed questions about women\u2019s safety.\n\n4.In India, a Muslim kidnapped and raped a 14-year-old Hindu girl, and forced her to read the Qur\u2019an and Islamic prayers.out on bail\n\n5.In a bizzare judgment, a 25-year-old Muslim rapist who was booked under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) has been\u00a0granted\u00a0bail after he agreed to marry the 16-year-old victim. The special POCSO court in Mumbai granted bail to the rapist because it found the relationship between the two was \u2018consensual\u2019 and he would marry the victim after two years when she becomes an adult.\n\n6.A Delhi Court on Wednesday granted bail to a man who has been booked for pronouncing talaq [in contravention of Section 4 of the Muslim Woman (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019] and committing gang rape on his wife. \n\n7. The Delhi High Court has granted anticipatory bail to a 35-year-old married man for allegedly raping a woman on false promise of marriage, saying the accused was not competent to marry the victim who was herself in a wedlock, and therefore could not have induced her into a physical relationship.\n\nI can give you many cases like these, it is the problem of legislature not religion.",

The Iraq War, the Afghanistan War, the saber-rattling with Iran, supporting Israel's apartheid against the Palestinians, etc. There was also a huge backlash against Muslims (and anyone who even remotely looked like Muslims, e.g. Sikhs) in the US in the aftermath of 9/11, resulting in a ton of vitriol and hate crimes.\n\nIn American (and even European) politics it requires a lot of nuance to be able to say \"Islam promotes hatred and bigotry\" without also going \"therefore we should go bomb this Middle Eastern country\". You'd think it would be easy but it's not. Christopher Hitchens is an infamous example, by all rights an incredible speaker when it came to criticizing religion, but his support of American interventionism in the Middle East was disastrous and really soured a lot of people on him. Sam Harris is another example.\n\nThe worst part is that it's the US's interventionism which has enabled radical Islam to thrive. The US props up Saudi Arabia which exports Wahhabism. Iran was on its way to becoming a secular democracy but had its ruler overthrown by the CIA and replaced with a dictator, which sowed the seeds for the Islamic Revolution. The Iraq War led to a power vacuum which enabled ISIS. The US supported the Afghan mujahideen (against the USSR) which turned into the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The US has supported radical Islamic groups in Syria against Assad. etc etc. And of course it's not just the US, many other western countries have taken part.",

She claimed separation of church and state only applied to supporting any specific religion and it's perfectly OK to support religion in general against the evil scourge of atheism. \n\nI see this trend a lot. Religious people are more willing to accept members of other religions, even wildly contradictory religions like Catholicism and Hinduism, rather than accept someone has no religion. They can understand a different religion, it's just like them but with the details changed, they pray to their own god and read their own holy book, it all makes sense. Wait you don't pray to any god? You think we all just came from monkeys? Does not compute. Error. Error. Life must contain religion. Does not compute.\n\nYou see people defending the burka by drawing a comparison to a nun's wimple. Completely ignoring the question of choice and what happens if you go out in public in Iran with your hair showing. Christian fundamentalists don't want to attack Islamic fundamentals because they want their own religious beliefs to be exempt from criticism too. It's like not mocking someone else's football team when they lose, purely because you don't want anyone to mock your football team not because you actually respect the other team and their supporters. \n\nAnd that's before we even get to their shared roots. Any argument you could use to undermine the legitimacy of Islam as a source of truth would also apply to Christianity or Judaism. You can't mock the origin story and the oldest teachings because it's the same origin story. You can't mock visions, centuries-old unverifiable personal accounts and claims asserted without evidence because that's all the New Testament is too.",

If you mean \"not going to be open to the validity of their religion\" then that's not Islamophobia. On the other hand, if someone is not open to getting in a taxi  with a driver they see coded as Muslim then that would be Islamophobic (weird wording because Sikhs are often the targets of Islamophobia due to ignorance on top of bigotry).",

And because there are no images, that means the people who do recreate his \"likeness\" usually resort to racially stereotypical images of Muslim men, which inherently attaches a racially malicious component to their critique of Islam. \n\nAlso, I would say that it's very problematic when people in the West that are not Muslim, and or did not grow up in a country dominated by a muslim majority, appropriate the stereotypical, racialized images of non-Western/Non-Christian cultures as a means of protesting and criticizing the religious nonsense of these specific cultures. This dilutes the very real, valid, and necessary criticisms of Islam, and instead shifts the focus to a racial caricature that encourages critics to *racialize* and essentialize the character of the cultures that believe in Islam. \n\nI'm not saying this as an accusation or as a character judgement. I just think these are socio-political nuances that we don't really think about too often in the West when we criticize the non-Western world. This is a criticism I hear often from Leftist/anti-fundamentalist folks from the Global South.\n\nEdit: As a member of the LGBTQ community myself, I try to amplify the voices and images of queer, NB, and trans Muslims as a form of protest against the virulent homophobia within most Muslim communities. It is counterproductive to engage in racialized criticisms of Islam's homophobia, because that racial-ism also harms Muslim/ex-Muslim LGBTQ people.",

Let's pretend that you're a Muslim person that is either from a Muslim-majority part of the world or you live in the West, but have deep ethnic ties to a Muslim country that your parents or grandparents immigrated from. Most likely your country (and therefore your family) has experienced decades upon decades (or even centuries for some) of violent, oppressive, and murderous European colonization and or imperialism - that still continues today in one form or another. \n\nThe citizens of the European countries that severely harmed and destabilized your nation/ethnic group for decades, have decided to criticize your community's religion and religious behavior (which is valid, even if hypocritical), but they can't just criticize your religion, nope. They also have to steal/appropriate your ethnic-religous figureheads (such as Muhammed), like they stole/appropriated your land and resources through imperialism. \n\nAnd then on top of that, because there are no actual re-created images of certain religious figures, they resort to using racist caricatures and images as a representation for these religious figures, which they use as just another way to insult, racially dehumanize, and purposely enrage the very same Muslim communities that they've  also tortured (Gitmo, Abu Graib, etc), starved, and bombed to hell for decades. \n\nSurely we can see why some folks would feel compelled to be upset within this particular historical context, right? \n\n>I'm not an LGBT person, but I would stand with them over those who want to persecute and kill them any day of the week\n\nWhich is great! We need people like you. Religion fucked me up for 2 whole decades of my life. Fuck it all! I'm just saying that using stereotypically racialized images, and purposely misappropriating elements of the cultures that your own western country has brutalized for decades, may not be the best way to help Muslim/ex-Muslim LGBTQ people.",

I condemn such crimes against anyone as much as I condemn religions like Islam and Christianty, for they, historically, have motivated hate crimes (wars) as well. Publicly bashing is not the way to go in my opinion, at least not without argument, not while blaming victims of indoctrination and certainly not in the presence of those who cannot comprehend with an open mind.\n\nIn this case Islamic believers are being targeted in Western countries, which is very wrong, for they are people just as anyone is. I absolutely condemn violence and am just as vocal against it in these same conversations. But there is a certain point where I can not be protective on someone's beliefs just for the sake of the horrible violence against them. I do what I can to protect, but I also stand for my voice and reasoning that aims at the prosperity and safety of all.\n\nI get the protective argument from 'wokeness' (for lack of a better word), but it's always a choice in the end, to defend a certain flag. I will defend humanity as a whole in that view against institutions that deem other humans as less worthy in general; in script, vocally and in deeds. \n\nIn short: it is not the bashing of humans that fell for this religion, and one should think where and when to speak. Sadly, even then people seem to see me as an aggressor that'd rather blow up a mosque than educate others on the dangers of partisan indoctrination.\n\nThat said: fuck Islam, fuck Christianity, fuck the patriarchy and/or fuck anyone who deems himself worthy of something more than others.",

For last 20 years, popular figures within this community have primarily pointed out islamic barbarity and sustained support for erronous policies which have led to calamitous results. That is not to say that this one sided enabling of the right wing narratives has also contributed to the current situation which is not ideal to say the least. \n\nAgain you mentioned that word, wokeness, which to me seems to be a simple overcompensation for this very community mindlessly looking at the world in black and white. \n\nThere are also facts that this community seems incapable of registering. That the world doesnt change so drastically without support of the strongest nations which happen to be the west. That it is the west and primarily america who backed and is partially responsible for the devolution of majority islamic states into a pathetic mess of fundamentalism and the curse continues on. It is not being apologetic to know these facts and keep them in consideration while conversing on such topics.\n\nEssentially when you dont employ that consideration and attempt to talk to a minority who is already on the defensive because of their circumstances.\n\nHere is perhaps a perspective that will help. A supposed anti-extremist organization inclined with sam harris continued its work by being donated money by rightwing american sources and british government succeeds in completely alienating a minority making it the most targetted in uk.\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/4/20/the-quilliam-foundation-has-closed-but-its-toxic-legacy-remains\n\nIn case you think thats biased, here are some more links.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right\n\nhttps://bridge.georgetown.edu/research/factsheet-quilliam/",

I critize religion for it, and do so without trying to inspire people to get vengeful on other humans. It's what religions do: separate the believers from the unbelievers with rethoric. It's plain evil to do so in my opinion.\n\nMaybe my English, or intelligence, isn't advanced enough to comprehend your meaning, but from what I understand, you are trying to tell me is that the West (with all the roots in Christianity) has made Islam all the more dangerous and that essentially being a westerner and telling why Islam is bad news for humanity is not ok.

You and me merely have different perspectives or views we can say.\n\nLet me clarify a couple of things first. We stand together on the view that religions themselves are terrible. Next islam is NOT safe from criticism. Also I think you might be wrong on the europe (christianity) waging war on the rest of the world for religious reasons. They were for neoliberal objectives and strictly geopolitical. \n\nTo answer your question, its yes and no. Yes, to the fact that America and its partners were and are the most powerful and drove the rest of the world into regressive states including those with islam in them. No to the fact that we as a community should censor ourselves from criticism of islam.\n\nThus we come to the view bit. I have come to believe that by just employing criticism and perhaps emboldening voices of our community who insist on alienation as a policy we are doing wrong. You can refer to the links I gave above that details the quilliam example. \n\nSo where does that lead us, take a look around here where almost all the comments in this thread are just bashing of a religion with different variations. The OP made a post and never even interacted. There is no nuance whatsoever, no historical perspective, no attempt to talk policy going forward or the policy that failed before. That is different from telling you not to talk about islam or other religions infact but to do so with more depth.\n\nThats all i can say on this matter, Hopefully it makes sense to you.",

Dialogue and reasoning should be the way. I checked the sources and only shake my head at what I read. \n\nMy only hope, when I'm vocal on these points, is that people see that we need to unite against intolerance from the larger mechanics that lull us into being intolerant without damaging ourselves. \n\nAnd then there's still the critique I catch for being vocal at first, like I'm some fascist not being allowed to critique at all. \n\nAnyways, the future will tell.

Average muslim visited mosque once per week, average hindu visits temple once per month.\n\n2)Muslims have very high fertility rate, only community with higher fertility than replacement in India.\n\n3)Muslim man marries non muslim women commonly( and then girl has to convert) but reverse is rare as women are not allowed freedom there.\n\n4)Huge number of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, Rohingyas, Afghanistan. (60million estimate)\n\n5)Once an area goes muslim majority, minority have to flee. Example Malda in East, kashmir in North, Malabar in south, Mewat in northwest, kairana.\n\n6)Significant number of Hindu and Jain religious leaders preaching celebacy, environment conservation,less children and anti natalism. For example search acharya Prashant, Sadhguru. \n\nWhat's more frustrating is that muslims of British India demanded and voted forpartition and got more lands in proportion of population(Bangladesh and Pakistan). Still they didn't leave. They have separate Sharia laws for them, separate land laws, enjoy minority benefits.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong Hindus are very mean people but mean towards each others and specially towards lower caste. First identity of Hindus is their caste unlike muslims whose first identity is often religion. Just imagine how evil islam would be that it has United all Indian castes across this much linguistic diversity. \n\nSometimes I think Burmese Buddhists had no other option but to throw away Rohingyas. Buddhists in general are very peaceful, here in India too.\n\nChristianity is also increasing in India specially among lower castes(Dalits) , mazhabi Sikhs and tribals because of discrimination. But Christians have no such problem of integration, and Christianity is not that political too. Like at least Christians are not killing people randomly because of religion, there are no Christian gangs, they are pro education.\n\nLike from first hand experience I am telling you if Christiany score 5/10 in lunacy, islam scores 10 and Hinduism 6.",

In Islam, women and men are separated at the Masjid, often put into separate rooms, women are not allowed to pray in front of, nor beside men, they have to pray behind them. If a woman prays in front of a man, that mans prayer is canceled out. There are so many other examples, verses and practices that just hammer home the anti feminism. If anyone else tried something similar, people would be outraged. If you had some meeting at some office job like a law or accounting firm, and all the women were forced to go to the back of the room behind the men, it would be seen as blatant sexism and no one would have any hesitation in calling it out.\n\nNow I also think people here focus so much on religion as an ideology, when they forget that religion is an identity and a social group. You gather to a place every Friday/Sunday to meet with like minded people, celebrate the same holidays, share similar culture, and it becomes dear to people. When people try to take in other identities that speak to them, such as Feminist, they have to somehow reconcile the two, so I don't view it so much as someone trying to be disingenuous, it's more someone wanting to be stay part of their social group that's so dear to them while also reconciling their personal beliefs. Doing away with religion can mean distancing yourself from friends at the Church/Masjid/Synagogue, it can mean cutting off some source of comfort in your life. That's what I see when I see these fairly delusional attempts at reconciliation.",

The lack of introspection on how Islamophobia is used to justify the global militaristic and imperial takeover of multiple [resource rich] countries, is a SERIOUS problem in the agnostic/atheist communities. \n\nYou can hate and criticize Islam with 1000% moral validity and confidence, but the problem is when your criticism 1) Allows more dominant religious groups to ignore their own divine violence and oppressive behavior, and 2) Makes people support the Western invasion, occupation, bombing, and indiscriminate killing that has taken place in Muslim countries for the past 2 decades. Millions of people have died because Western people lack the political nuance to discern genuine religious criticism vs pro-imperialism propaganda.",

These people are just making up offensive things. Come to my mosque and I will show you the quran and you will see there is nothing homophobic in there anywhere. \"\n\nI thought this seemed a bit fishy. I can believe there being different interpretations of the meaning of certain verses but it seems unlikely that a religion pretty famous for being homophobic wouldn't have ANY mentions of homosexuality anywhere in there?\n\nSo I looked it up. Technically he's right, the quran does not condemn homosexuality. The Hadith, a different Islamic holy book and the foundation of Islamic law, that's where all the bits about homosexuality are written. So he was just playing wordgames and pretending Islam wasn't homophobic. He was an imam he knew full well that the Hadith had these homophobic parts and the Hadith is a highly respected holy book and was relying on the audience not knowing the difference so he could trick people. \n\nIt's like saying the Bible doesn't feature dragons, that's just absurd, nowhere in the Old Testament or the Gospels is there any mention of a dragon. But you're secretly laughing about tricking people because the dragons are in Revelations and you carefully worded it to not mention that part. It's deliberately dishonest and deceitful.",

It's translated there as \"You shall not lie with a BOY as with a woman\" explicitly referring to a child. I saw an article of a Jew overhearing a Christian friend reading the Bible and being shocked at the difference so they dug out the oldest version of the Torah and in there it's a word that translates as \"child\" without any mention of gender. I'm not sure how true that story is though. For one thing it might have been about another verse entirely and also there's a million stories about people accidentally stumbling across a 'more correct' translation of the Bible.",

In a historical standpoint is was awesome taking the 2 classes at the same time because it lined up so well and really cemented into my brain how much Religion is just an authoritarian scheme to keep poor and powerless in there place.  However, watching the original civilizations start to move and conquer as they gained intelligence and power was quite interesting!  It seemed like every  time they would take over a new territory, the combination of the former civ and the new civ that took over created new thought and new ideas (which I think everyone knows and understands) therefore, elevating and evolving its thoughts and beliefs.  So I theorized (very amateurly) that even though war and conquering is terrible and violent it causes human evolution.  Thus, since the civilations started in the Middle East, even with constant war but no new takeovers, they have caused themselves to stay in the past with ignorant and horrible beliefs and religions.  Anyway, just a little brain dump for me today.",

And what bothers me most is those white and privileged people in first world countries talking shit about Islamophobia. They need to be born as a girl or a gay boy in Iran. Only then they will at least shut the fuck up about it. I'm not even expecting them to talk about the reality of Islamic countries. Just shut the fuck up about Islamophobia. There's no such thing. A phobia is an unreasonable fear of something. Fearing Islam is the most reasonable thing to do. I'm so jealous of you lucky people being born in anywhere but middle-east. We started protesting again for the murder of that girl and the police killed a couple of teenagers that we know of. Tell me, when the government and police are the perpetrators, who the fuck we can call for help? The answer is no one. Nothing. Like what modern countries do to save our people from this deeply barbaric regime from getting brutally murdered in the streets by the hijab police. Nothing. No one talks about it. No one does anything to help. They just don't want to offend the terrorists. I must add, I have yet to meet a Muslim person that isn't radically and deeply troubled and without a drop of exaggeration, mad. We're utterly fucked. I think we should wait for the spilled blood of those girls and boys to dry and then respect these fucker's outdated belief system. I live in Iran. So I know. Just to be clear, I don't mind individuals believing whatever the fuck they want to believe. But with everything that happens in here, yeah, organized religion must be deleted from the face of the planet. It's total madness. A nightmare. But go ahead and respect everyone's fucking opinion. It's not like everyone has one. (sorry if I sound cunty, it's just a bloodshed in here and we need people to know.)",

Just pretend that religion is really a good thing, and only the fringe hurt one another. It's a twisted way of making the harm of religion as \"other\", instead of seeing normal, rational people become monsters under its influence. \n\nConversely, the political extreme on the other side really does have Islamophobia, in the sense that they want to believe that Sharia law is eminent and America is on a knife's edge of total Christian destruction. *eyeroll* I'd love for every one of those asshats to be forced to live the theocracy they dream of.",

It's not even about the religion. They don't want to lose their place in this corrupt monstrosity of a political system. They are desperate and they have an army of deluded, self-righteous sociopaths. And we only have scared and withered people too tired and beaten to start a revolution. I'm so sick of it. We struggle for our lives just to be the target of some incel trolls' opinion. Islam at its core is a violation of human rights. You can cherry pick every religion and leave the bad stuff behind and it might lead to a beautiful literature and some form of spiritual comfort. But people have to take it literally and go to wars for it. It just doesn't work like that. Thanks for reading. Love.",

As a Satanist (Atheistic of course), a big part of our beliefs is to live your life how you desire, as long as it does not affect another being against their own consent\u2026  thus allowing others to live their lives for themselves just the same.\n\nAn individual should be able to have their own sexuality, as well as their own identity, as it affects no one outside themselves (when it comes to sexual nature, consent is a must of course). So yes, if someone is gay, lesbian, transgender, etc. they are encouraged to live life in a way that pleases them (not a higher being or other person) that then allows them to live a life in which they are able to fully value themselves and live.

The problem is if you see a white person you don't assume they are Christian and beat them up/destroy their business on that assumption.\n\nAfter 9/11 anyone that looked brown was being attacked, including the actually decent Sikhs.

When u see people hating on the lgtbq as in violence they are not practicing the religion because we are taught to ignore it and it's between them and God and non of our business to judge. On the other hand, some atheists and some lgbtq wants to force us to believe in it. It's very hypocritical because I'm sure you people wouldn't want Muslims to force you to believe in ours.

Unless you live in a Muslim-majority nation (which you very well might), it's Christianity that is a demonstrable, direct threat to the rights of LGBTQ+ folks in the west. Evangelical extremism under the banner of Christianity has been exported for generations, and is currently at the forefront of rolling back LGBTQ+ rights, at a bare minimum, in the US (I imagine this is similar in the UK and Canada, though I'm less of an expert). So I guess I struggle when I see people directing all this often performative rage at Islam when Christianity is the one slapping the shackles on us at the very same time.",

People in those places don't have to \"pretend\" to think Christianity is tolerant. I'm talking about relatively liberal environments, like university environments as an example . In the same environments, people are more tense about making similar arguments about Islam, worrying about it being seen as \"Islamophobic\". It's not that those conversations don't happen, but they aren't as casual. I think this post is more about the double standard about how anti-christianity sentiment is more \"socially acceptable\" than anti-islam sentiments. Whether that double standard has a reason to exist, or the extent to which it is socially enforced, is up for debate I guess. I'm just trying to clarify that this OP almost surely has a problem with expressing disgust with homophobia in Christianity, but just doesn't feel pushback on that expression hence not bringing it up here.",

I haven\u2019t met many Muslims, but there is no conceivable way they can be more homophobic than most of the Christians and Catholics I grew up around. My own mother told me that she believes it\u2019s one of the government\u2019s jobs to round up gay people and give them a choice between concerting to Christianity or being executed. Islam has just been able to survive with its virulent homophobia intact because it\u2019s in a part of the world where religion is still an extremely effective tool of control. I believe the stirrings of dissent in Iran and Afghanistan are proof that a progressive turn is in store for the Middle East and, when that domino falls, Islam in developed nations will also mellow out considerably. Muslims, like all of us, want to live in a polite and orderly society, and they will abandon their backward beliefs once we make it clear to them that they will not be tolerated as part of ours.",

[(Source)](https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/religious-landscape-study/religious-family/atheist/views-about-homosexuality/)\n\nIn other words, American Christians and Muslims are about equal in terms of acceptance, but come vastly behind atheists.\n\nHyper-focusing on one religion when there's no evidence to support your wild claims about \"the foundations\" of a religion makes you look like a dumbass. People don't believe religions because of the religious texts or foundations. People don't give a shit about history. They believe because they were culturally indoctrinated at a young age.\n\nReligion is **inherently flexible.** (That's precisely the problem with it.) Despite how powerful indoctrination is, some religious people still emerge with budding progressive views and values.\n\n Dismissing progressive Muslims because they don't fit into your narrow idea that \"all Muslims are backwards barbarians\" makes you look like a dumbass bigot. Religion shifts and evolves over time. You should celebrate any trend toward progressivism and any shift away from dogmaticism.\n\n**Roots don't matter.** Never did, never will. De-humanizing progressive-minded Muslims and writing them off as a lost cause, however, will ensure your views never reach beyond the narrow echo chambers you subscribe to. They will write you off as the narrow-minded, hateful bigot you accuse them of being. Do better.",

Even it's moral tenets preachs kindness, respect, honesty, patience and justice.\n\nIf u studied the religion even at a surface level you would know this instead of what u see on reddit and other media which ALWAYS depicts the worst of people when they are not in our group. \n\nLike do u honestly think ALL practicing Muslims think like that? Do you even consider the vast majority of Muslims just what to practice there faith and let you practice yours?",

Homosexual activity is prohibited in Judaism (Leviticus 18) and Christianity (Romans 1) as well, if your definition is \"There are texts that say X.\" But that's not how religion works.\n\nClaiming anything about \"Islam\" can be dangerous, because Islam is an abstract idea, and when you start applying that to people, you risk being hate mongering, which can result in death (like the Sikh man, Balbir Singh Sodhi, who was murdered after 9/11 because some asshat thought he was a Muslim).\n\n\"Islam\" is no more homophobic than Christianity (there are more anti-gay passages in the Christian Bible than there are in the Qur'an). If you want to say that there's a problem with the degree to which many Muslims emphasize sexuality disproportionately to the core tenets of their doctrine, fine. Do that; call them out. Condemn anti-gay, heteronormative-pushing Muslims. I'll be right there with you. But claiming \"Islam\" is inherently homophobic is just a faulty understanding not just of Islam, but of religion in general.\n\nSee this video, by a respected YouTuber (with a PhD in religious studies from Boston University) for a good analysis of this kind of thing: https://youtu.be/_g9pdWyAaDs",

If you are worried about being anti-Islam putting you on the same team as reactionary right wingers, don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t. Those people hate Muslims not because they believe in a tyrannical theocratic nightmare, but because it clashes with the style of tyrannical theocratic nightmare they want to impose instead. And because they are brown. \n\nWhat you SHOULDNT do is discriminate against people who grew up in Muslim countries simply because the fact that they come from there. There are many cultural ideas they grew up that have absolutely nothing to do with oppressive norms, just like there\u2019s many cultural ideas we westerners have grown with that have nothing to do with Christianity\u2019s massively oppressive norms either.\n\nYou can be anti-Islam while not being a racist piece of shit that treats Muslim individuals like ass, even innocent ones, for no reason. Just like you can be anti-patriarchy without being a misandrist piece of shit that treats individual men like ass, even in invent ones, for no reason. Or anti-monarchy without hating every English person you\u2019ve ever met. I hope that makes sense. \n\n\u201cBe harsh on the system, but soft on the person\u201d and all that.

So a lot of the homophobia focus tends to be on the more homophobic group, especially since they vastly outnumber Muslims in this country.",

It is in the nature of world religions, as both Islam and Christianity were invented by men in a time when women and homosexuals had little value. It is the way Islam is misused to control the population in vicious dictatorships that makes homophobia more prominent in many Muslim countries. The less religious the population of a nation is, the more tolerant they are of love in all colors and forms. And the more equal women are. This is measurable and can be seen on all UN indexes of human development. I agree with your conclusion, but think the criticism must be directed at all religions, especially Islam and Christianity. It is certainly not easy to be gay in Christian Russia either.",

When you start to understand that religion and social evolution both function on a linear timeline, it gets a lot easier to not hate these religions and just accept they are outdated. Yes, there are a lot of Muslims in the world that subscribe to some of the more questionable beliefs in the Quran, but I don't find any difference in them and Christianity. The only difference is more Muslims strictly adhere to scripture than Christians. Everyone wants compassion and acceptance for who they are. This post is a perfect example of that. Everyone deserves it. Everyone.  Even the ones you don't agree with. That last bit can be a hard pill to swallow when you're persecuted, but you'll feel a lot better going into the world with that outlook. For reference, I have family members killed by an Islamic regime. I've been bullied and ganged up on by Muslims for not being one. But I'm not gonna let the same hate in their heart seep into mine.

There are also the Quranists who disavow all the _hadith_ (all the analysis in the Quran). That's where most of the hatred, repression, oppression, and general nastiness comes from.\n \nEveryone considered everyone else a vile heretic to be put to death, of course.\n\nBut if you badge it all with one label, then anyone from any part will react with hostility. \n\nAFAICT the Ahmaddiya seem to be the decent moderate folks, and I think it's important to remember that there _is_ an alternative without all the hate.",

I think we need to look at this from a more societal level rather than from a \u201cIslam is bad\u201d perspective, and I think it boils down to strict societal control through conservative theocracy. One can not develop more progressive ideologies, or they at least cannot openly express them, if their government threatens their safety for doing so and heavily works to indoctrinate the population. The same could happen to any religions, a Christian theocracy could prioritize controlling beliefs over others, other theocracies could interpret holy texts or divine messages in a way to control society, and more. If you look at the United States at it\u2019s inception it was heavily Christian and a lot of these problems existed there too. We must note that two hundred and some years is nothing compared to human society, and we must also note that the Middle East and Africa have been impacted by imperialism quite a bit which also influences social structure.\n\nTLDR; I don\u2019t disagree that the religion can be conservatively interpreted to be homophobic, sexist, etc. but I think this take ignores some nuance. The primary difference between Islam and other religions in this case is the level of societal control that conservative interpretation of Islam holds, and this can be partially blamed on the interference of external powers during the Cold War (for example, there\u2019s more examples).",

Moreover, vmPFC patients reported increased specific religious beliefs after brain injury.   \nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22612576/  \nCorrelational and standard regression analysis confirmed that for this sample scores on authoritarianism and religious fundamentalism were positively correlated, with scores on authoritarianism significantly related to those on ethnic and racial prejudice, and punitiveness.   \nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2466/pr0.1992.71.3f.1291\r  \n\r  \nRWA scores of right-wing party supporters were significantly higher than those of left-wing party supporters, and scores of secular subjects in both societies were lowest.\u00a0   \nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022196272005  \nScores on both Religious Fundamentalism and Religious Quest scales also were correlated strongly with right-wing authoritarianism and the Christian Orthodoxy scale, although orthodoxy itself tended not to be correlated with prejudice. Apparently, religious fundamentalism and nonquesting are linked with authoritarianism and prejudice toward a wide variety of minority groups.   \nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327582ijpr0202\\_5",

Religion invented marriage between men and women. Marriage is not made for atheist. \n\n3. Why is being gay or in the hbtq wrong? If a mother and a son would have sex and used condoms how is this in moral act but not being 2 men or 2 women etc. \n\nThis is just a few things I mentioned. Islam do not se women as a sex toy not a property for the man. Please do research and go to a model to talk to the sheikh.",

      "text": "Well said. Thank you.\n\nI am an Iranian woman and I can't explain how painful it is when Muslims claim what we suffer from in Iran (and are rioting against the past two weeks) are not directly related with Islam. Like where do they think the legislation in an Islamic country comes from? The religion itself!! LGTBQ+ rights are non-existent, women inherit half as much as their brothers, a women's testimony is worth half as that of man's, a woman's Diya (financial compensation paid to the family of the victim) is half as that of a man, it is clearly stated in Quran that women should cover up if they don't want to get harassed (victim blaming at its finest), women cannot divorce their husbands and do not get custody of their kids after divorce (unless they make sure that the dude signs a document before marriage granting her these rights, but even when they do it's not exactly a walk in the park).\n\nI think it's great that Western Muslims are practicing reformed Islam (either by force or choice). However, the majority of Western Muslims and the woke are contributing to a false image of Islam where anything directly stemming from Islamic teachings is mislabeled as wrong execution, government's fault, Muslims' fault, wrong interpretation, extremism etc. Somehow they are never willing to accept that the fault is within some parts of Islam itself and that hurts any and every human rights movements in countries governed by Islam. Every time news or criticism about human rights violation in Muslim countries come up, Muslims rush to claim that \"this is not the real Islam\". Actually it all is.",

No one in their right mind would defend any form of organized religion, whether it be Islam or whatever else. And by not condemning the lack of equal rights for women, LGBTQ+ and any minority groups you just demonstrated what a regressive mindset you got. \n\nFastest growing religion for a reason that maybe you hate to admit. When a child is born to Muslim parents (even if only the father is Muslim), then under Islamic laws that child is immediately converted to Islam. No choice there. If when you grow up you wanna leave Islam, you\u2019ll be faced with a death sentence under Islamic laws.  Muhammed guided Muslim armies into invading many countries. They didn\u2019t come peacefully. They raped, burnt and destroyed so that they could spread the word of the most peaceful religion to as many people as they could. One tiny detail though, they forced their religion and converted so many people through their swords. And after that it was automatic conversion at birth. \n\nYou might think Islam is not going anywhere but perhaps you might wanna consider that the atrocities that Islam is committing and the level of violence it encourages, is hidden to no one unless brainwashed and indoctrinated folks like yourself. \n\nJust out of curiosity, you ever asked yourself why the god capable of creating diverse universes with such meticulous detail and complex science should be so hateful towards homosexuals? Hint: The god that created the universe and everything that it entails is not your god. Your god seems to have a breadth of knowledge that doesn\u2019t exceed that of a 7th century dessert dweller.

I'm a muslim and i will try to tell you why. \nBesides it doesn't suport it does not allow muslims to attack poeple who are diffrent forcing somebody to be a certain way is haram in islam *forbidden*. \n\nAnyways the Islam is a religion of thousands and thousands years old. The book the quran is the word of god and the context of how to live. You find that in the Sunnah it's the biography of Mohammed, this is why muslims have beards and all they try to be like Muhammed. Now i see a lot of hate from the west on the islam but there is a totally diffrent perspective on life. For muslims life 'dunya' is just a test. When they die we will face allah and he will look at our good and bad deeds. So being gay isn't wrong in Islam per se. But having sex with a woman is. There elso isn't really a thing as mordern muslims. Thats bullshit cause that would imply that the religion is changible. But it isn't it's not changible. It's not like christianity which man made. Centuries ago the bible and quran where almost the same but they changed the bible and they still do. The islam is a lot about discipline and really believing in allah. From a western perspective and lesbian i understand you. But muslims do not hate you they just follow a religion hating you cause of a sin. Will make you turn away and thats is a sin aswell. Anyways if you have questions i will try to answer them. \n\nSalamalykum (may peace be with you).",

      "text": "First of all: you judge the religion based on the Muslims, not based on the Quran/the sunnah. \nYes, homosexuality is haram and it is transgressing. May allah forgive and guide you and these people who say \u201athis is the old islam\u2018, because islam wasnt and won\u2019t be changed (the Quran won\u2019t be changed and wasn\u2019t changed). \nThe following reasons may explain why it\u2019s haram:\n\n1. Homosexuals go against the natural disposition (fitrah) which Allah has created in mankind. 2. The spread of homosexuality and lesbianism has caused man diseases which neither the east nor the west can deny exist because of them. 3. Homosexuality and lesbianism cause the breakup of the family and lead people to give up their work and study because they are preoccupied with these perversions.\n\nLet me make a example, you say I love water, I always drink water. Now would you drink toilet water? Of course not. Just like for this impure water, there is also inappropriate love. \nHowever you can\u2019t be punished for your feelings. Only if you act upon them, you are sinning, for example flirting with the same gender (or just with the opposite gender, which is haram for both man and women) or being in a relationship with the Same gender (girlfriend-boyfriend relationships are generally haram for both genders in Islam).\nIf a muslim, has these homosexual feelings, he\u2019s not less than a muslim than I am. Maybe he\u2019s/she\u2019s even more beloved to allah than I, because he or she restraints themselves from their feelings. \n2: islam is not a hateful or sexist religion. In fact islam says that women and men both have equal rights. Our beloved prophet Muhammad saw himself frequently counseled Muslim men to treat their wives and daughters well. \"You have rights over your women,\" he is reported to have said, \"and your women have rights over you.\"\nAlso muslim women have a right to use the money of their husband/it is the money of both. But if the wife has her own fortune/money, it\u2019s her own. \nWhat probably makes you think that Islam is sexist, is probably because of how some Muslim countries have wrong laws and the current feminism, that is NOT trying to promote equal rights for men and women. If it did, then why isn\u2019t it called equalism? If it did, then why doesn\u2019t any feminist talk about mentally Ill men, about men with problems, who no one talks about. (For example the current state in Ukraine, where men fro 18-60 years old, are not allowed to leave the country but are expected to fight and die. While women and children are allowed to leave.)\nBut that\u2019s another topic. \nNow islam teaches that men and women aren\u2019t the same. We do have equal rights, but we aren\u2019t the same. A man is built different and has other duties, such as providing for family or protecting his family. Just like the woman, who has her own duties and is built different, which is why she has to cover her body (just like the man). The idea that women should work is just absurd. Women and men worked back then in Medina. Most of the accomplishments in society were done by women. \n3: islam is not hateful. Islam teaches to be good to others no matter who they are, which faith the belong to, etc. now I do not support or accept LGBTQ in any way, but I respect you. I will treat you with respect, however I will not try to get too.  close. A Muslim has to watch his/her tongue and be respectful. Our beloved prophet Muhammad saw was always kind, always smiled. When the quraish (the enemy of our prophet Muhammad saw, who were disbelievers) laughed at him, talked bad about him, he never was disrespectful. He never called them names. We have to be respectful. It seems to me that you are confused about Islam. I dare you, if you aren\u2019t afraid of change, then read about the life of our prophet Muhammad saw tonight with an open mind. If you aren\u2019t afraid of change, then read our Quran.  \nIslam accepts all the other prophets, such as Jesus peace be upon him, Moses peace be upon him, Abraham peace be upon him, etc. \nThe Torah and the Bible were once the book of allah, but they were and are changed, we have the final testament. The Quran. It is not changed and there are many miracles in it such as the explanation about the rotation of our planets and the sun, embryology, the creation of the universe (Big Bang) and the expansion of it, etc. \nThe idea that there is no god, just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nExample:\nLet\u2019s look at google. In order for google to exist we need the Internet. In order for the internet to exist, we need our computers, phones, tablets, etc. in order for those to exist, there has to be human beings that are created, etc. it relies on electricity. \nThe following question is:\nGoogle relies on the internet, the internet relies on the computer, the computer relies on us and the electricity. And this goes on. We cannot have an infinite regress of dependent things. We require a place where it all stops and makes sense, which is the independent, self-sufficient, necessary, being which is god/Allah.\nAnd allah knows best.\nMay allah guide you and forgive you amin.",

The problem isn't entirely the religion nowadays, it's how much of a role it takes up in their society. \n\nI grew up with a best friend who was muslim and his parents too (he's an atheist now). But his parents were muslim like your typical European christian is religious, which is to say: very slightly. So they were extremely reasonable, preached the usual cherrypicked love and acceptance and that's about it. They even kept their son out of Quran school because they noticed fundamentalist teachings.   \n\n\nAt the same time i have parts of my family who still are traditionalist christians, and they are homophobic as to shun members of their own family for it.   \n\n\nThe difference is, in most western countries, religion has just been pushed back a whole lot. To the point where it's more of an afterthought to most people than anything else. So most people, especially in younger generations have lost that homophobia.  \nWhile in muslim communities, due to the ultra conservativism in the east the last decennia, it has way too much of a crucial day to day role. This makes the amount of muslims who adhere to the typical homophobia quite a bit greater.   \n\n\nBut you don't have to go far back in history to find similar levels of homophobia here, minus the brutal sharia.",

You hate Islamic people andor the Islamic religion and you\u2019re trying to find an excuse to target them and rile others up (usually trumpster racist biggots who have zero issue forming armed, angry mobs and shooting schools, libraries and religious gatherings) that ultimately get people KILLED. \nYOU are the problem. NOT Islam or the Islamic people or the Islamic faith. \nYou and ONLY you are the problem. Deal with it and stop trying to DESTROY innocent peoples lives because of your hate and stupidity.",

The last one is the vibe I get from the tolerant muslims I've interacted with. Like, they still want to be fully connected with their family and culture, because who doesn't, and at the same time they want to reject the discrimination that they don't subscribe to and observe other cultures also rejecting. I think that's fine, actually, and if they can grow in numbers and influence over the horde of entrenched open haters, I wish them success.\n\nThere are christians in the world right now that are doing a million times more damage to the safety and well being of LGBTQ people in western communities in the name of thier faith. Why should you and I tolerate christianity more than islam? \n\nIs it because muslims are a marginalized minority and everyone is itching for a little tit-for-tat? That's what your post smells like to me, and it's not going to solve ANY of our big picture problems.\n\nYou clearly understand how wrong, toxic, pointless, and unacceptable it is for you to be subjected to prejudice based discrimination based on sexuality. So what you're being asked to do is to treat individual people based on their choices and actions, not over things they don't have control over. Most people don't really choose their religion, and most people are stuck in a shitty one.\n\nI don't know what exactly you advocating as a solution... Maybe you are just venting a valid frustration with how religion upholds dangerous beliefs with so little accountability? What concrete actions are you even asking for?",

In the \"West\" it's usually a manifestation of xenophobia, while being wierdly more tolerant of the more pernicious issues that exist in our own culture. The fact is that all three are horrifically oppressive by their very nature and just because some people choose to ignore that for their own cognitive dissonance doesn't mean the rest of us should.\n\nGo ahead and downvote me, a gay man who had his childhood corrupted by Christianity. It won't make me wrong. Islam is evil, but I was a victim of Christianity, not Islam, so if you want to point out the dangers of one you must critique them both with the same standards.",

They're just trying to say you can't criticise islam without people like you popping up and saying \"but Christianity/racism/oppression of minorities\". Those are all valid points to be kept in mind, but not synonymous with the discussion.",

I see people calling people out on being xenophobic, and they are right to do so. It's so much easier to criticize Islam because everyone loves to have a foreign enemy to point at. It's facile and it lends itself to people developing serious problems with anti-arab racism. \n\n>you can't criticise islam without people like you popping up and saying \"but Christianity/racism/oppression of minorities\"\n\nWho said \"but\"? I'm saying \"and\". If you want to criticize Islam without creating the impression of being xenophobic you *must* go all the way and criticize Judaism and Christianity despite the risk of losing friends and being called anti-semitic as well. I don't want people to stop criticizing Islam. I want to see the end of all Abrahamic religions.",

      "text": "The one thing I love about the Muslim religion is they\u2019re at least open and honest about their hatred. We live in Europe, in Belgium, we have many devout Muslim friends and acquaintances\u2026 we are open about it, not flaunting our homosexuality\u2026 but we\u2019re not usually perceived as homos.  \n\nWhy pick on the Muslims?  Most large organized religions openly and un-openly hate us. Perhaps \"hate\" is too strong a word, they dislike us at various degrees\u2026 we would no more be invited to a Ramadan celebration as we would be allowed to marry in their churches or have our children christened.\n\nI come from a very devout Christian family, I moved from Southern California to Europe 30 years ago (1992), after the AIDS holocaust (I lost 14 friends), and a year after coming out.  The hate was thick and ugly so my decision to work and live abroad was an easy one. I kept a safe distance, I was not welcomed for family celebrations or holidays (that\u2019s 30 years of no Christmas' or well wishes with any family)\n\nWe flew over and attended my father\u2019s funeral in 2019, I could never have prepared my Belgian husband enough for what he was about to experience.  An atheist, world experienced, educated and raised in a beautiful large loving family.  Hate or infighting is not in their vocabulary.  My not even inviting a single member of my family to our wedding had always remained a mystery to them.  A mystery solved minutes after arriving at my home to pay respects to my mother.  The loving Christian hate was in full regalia, it was thick and felt, we were verbally assaulted from minute one.  To say my husband was in shock is putting it mildly.  \n\nSure the Muslims hate us homos, they hate women, the hate their homo children and homo relatives, yada, yada, yada.  So what?  Organized large religions have been hating and tolerating us forever and I doubt that\u2019s ever going to change.  Their members may like us, some may even love us but their religions and holy leaders teach them otherwise and their books and writings tell them it\u2019s okay.\n\nI understand your anger, what I don\u2019t understand is you airing out what you always knew, what we all know.  Hatred, bigotry, racism and intolerance is not taught in our schools or homes it is taught from pulpits in our churches, temples, mosques & cathedrals.",
