Is the CIA in on it too? \n\nThe threat of military action (whatever that means) has absolutely nothing to do with the petrodollar nor eurodollar. The US economy is massive, a rational actor prefers to hold foreign currency in large rather than small markets. Its the most easily convertible currency (compare to CNY/CNH). The petrodollar simplifies trading instead of having to convert to/from several currencies. For example, almost all (90%+) FX trades go through the dollar. \n\nStop pretending like you understand economics from reading reddit crypto posts.",

That's literally the only reason everyone else bought in and played too lol. (oh just for full disclosure, these games rise and crash quicker and more often that meme coins lol.) \n\nCollectibles nfts are  pretty dumb. People following the hype.  I mean if actual games release digital collectables that way it'd be kinda cool, but that's totally different than current nft collectables/why ppl buy them (hype /chasing $$).\n\n\nThe only real gaming nft ecosystem out there is like decentraland and sandbox game, I know more about the latter but it's basically roblox in the meta verse with nfts as assets. They just provide the ecosystem (big Minecraft like world) and people buy land to have their own game, game creators can buy from the nft marketplace for assets to use (so even asset creators make $) then game creators can monetize their game as they see fit.",

As an NFT owner \ud83d\udcaf myself, nothing \ud83d\udeab brings \ud83d\udeb6 me more joy \ud83d\ude0a than poorfrags seething \ud83d\ude24 at my collection \ud83d\udca6. Perhaps \ud83d\ude0d spend \ud83d\udcb0 more time \ud83d\udd50 in school \ud83c\udfeb learning \ud83e\udd13 about \ud83d\udca6 block-chain \u2601 and encryption \ud83d\udd10 and less \u2796 playing \ud83c\udfae video \ud83d\udcf9 games \ud83c\udfb1\u203c\ud83c\udccf. haha \ud83d\ude02   \n  \nEdit \ud83d\udcdd: Imagine \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcad thinking \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\udcad that copy-pasting \ud83d\udce0 an image \ud83d\udcf8 is the same as owning \ud83d\udd2b it. As you \ud83d\udc48 can clearly \ud83d\ude0b\ud83d\ude09 see \ud83d\udc40 from the bc \ud83d\ude30 (block \ud83d\udeab\ud83c\udf46\u274c chain \u26d3 for you \ud83d\udc48 non-tech people \ud83d\udc6b\ud83d\udc66\ud83d\udc67) , I \ud83d\udc65 am the rightful \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude2c owner \ud83d\ude0e of the artwork \ud83d\udd8c. Any and all \ud83d\udcaf duplications \u26ab are thus \ud83d\ude2e a cheap \ud83d\udcb8 replica \u2795.   \n  \n  \nEdit2: The fact \u2611 that people \ud83d\udc6b think \ud83e\udd14 \"copy \ud83d\udcdd pasting \ud83d\udce5\" is somehow \ud83d\ude06 harming \ud83e\udd15 NFTs is hilarious \ud83d\ude06. Is the Mona \ud83c\udd71 Lisa \ud83d\ude02 devalued when \ud83c\udf51 someone \ud83d\udc64 takes \ud83d\udc4a a picture \ud83d\udcf8 of it? Educate \ud83c\udf93 yourselves.",
