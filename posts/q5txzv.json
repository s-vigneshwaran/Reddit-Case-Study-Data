This is the best part, they're literally killing their own audience.\n\nHypocrisy at News Corp was and still is a thing. They often film a segment and then laugh about it being so bad yet people will believe it.\n\nMy favourite analogy was that one when Hasan Minhaj told that Fox says bad things against immigrants yet he sees them every day in queue for halal chicken. Take this and extend it to everything they do. They'll scream about the vaccines, but this is just a cover to keep people preoccupied and feeling like they fight some kind of war. This is how right brainwashes people. They tell them that someone wants to take away something from you, even if this wasn't yours to begin with or isn't true at all. Some will die, sure, but they have a captive audience that now believes it's just that everybody else lies and they're the intelligent ones that oppose something evil. In reality, there's no evil.\n\nI mean, look at this. https://theconversation.com/five-things-to-know-about-the-antichrist-148172",

              "text": "I see several flaws in the first article you posted.\n\nThe 60% vaccination rate quoted for Israel is far below the threshold usually admitted for herd immunity. It is estimated at 70% for the US which is one order of magnitude less densely populated than Israel (36 h/km\u00b2 versus 400 h/km\u00b2 respectively).\n\nIt does not explain how it controls for the ethnic differences in vaccination policies (arab israeli and palestinian have been excluded from the vaccination effort). Considering the living condition (especially access to healthcare) in the Gaza strip and the West Bank, this is something that should be accounted for in the methodology.\n\nIt does not explain either how it controls for the relaxation of COVID-19 prevention measures (like, lockdown, quarantine, etc) which happened far too early, given that not enough vaccination occured yet.\n\nMoreover, this is not a peer reviewed paper, but a letter to the editor of the European Journal of Epidemiology, a relatively minor journal in its field.\n\nThis is what I figured by reading it.\n\nIt has been published not two weeks ago, and already I can find plenty of critiques online. This is what I found in about 10 minutes by googling the name of the journal, and the id of the article.\n\nThe limit of time of just seven days of evolution is just... preposterous.\n\nIt does not control for differing policies and testing capacities in countries and US counties.\n\nUltimately, it's not too bad a job of data gathering for a high schooler (which, incidentally, one of author of the article is), but the interpretation is somewhat lacking in substance.\n\nI'm sure there's a simple explanation for this, but the dates used are inconsistent as well. It purport to use data released on Sept 3rd, but the meta-data in the article shows that it has been submitted on August 17th. Oops.\n\nFinally, I'm going to be treading dangerously close to ad-hominem, but I believe that whose support one gets tells a lot about one's work. This article has been peddled online by Didier Raoult (the HQC fiasco guru), a man who is seriously lacking in the ethics department, has been fired from the EJoE about a year ago and is discrediting himself scientifically every time he gives a press conference.\n\nMeanwhile, the Medxriv article you posted has not been peer reviewed, contrary to what you posted. It says so in big bold letters right under the authors' list and above the abstract.",

He's fucking gone. I can't do anything about this now. Please stop.\n\nEdited to add: I think you're missing the point - that antivaxxers die and their pro-vax loved ones are left with that loss.

The research is counter-intuitive but clear on this.\n\nThere is a really involved and long, personal process to change someone's mind, and neither arguing or shame is it.  Its not shame mostly because these people in particular are incapable of shame.\n\nThere was this muslim filmmaker that managed over the course of years to change ONE MIND.\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/04/the-muslim-director-who-filmed-neo-nazis-i-thought-im-not-going-to-make-it-out\n\nThere are some ex-neo-nazis that also are in the field of doing this work but it is painfully slow.\n\nMy position is that the effort vs results doesn't justify it.  Its really a huge lift for marginal gain.  There is an opportunity cost to everything.",
