For example when I had depression it felt like I died and came back to life many times. Also there's the carbon cycle (When we die we become the grass, and the antelope eat the grass),  and in the modern day being an organ donor.",

I think a lot of it depends on the timeline too.  I worked there for about a year, moonlighting to get some medical bills for my kids paid off.  It was 2003, and I distinctly remember watching the news in the breakroom when the Discovery broke apart during reentry.  When I was there, it was a little while after they got in trouble for violating lots of rules, and so they were VERY strict during training about following the FDCPA, FCRA, and TILA regulations.  They enforced it on the floor as well, and did not tolerate agents that would put them at risk of violating the laws again.  This continued all the way through when I left, which was right as Citi bought their credit operations.\n\nI've dealt with some horrible collection agencies over the years with \"medically fragile\" children (as a short way to put it) and I never saw any of the same shady tactics in use at Sears.  Of course ours was one of several call centers too, so it could have been different despite claims to the contrary by management.",

Don't work for a porn company.  \nThink contraception is a sin?  Don't work for a fucking drugstore.  Selling contraception is one of the things a drug store does.  If you have a moral problem with that, then don't dirty yourself by working for a company that so violates your values.  \n\nAnd for Walgreens- grow a spine and stand up to this crap.  It's not tolerance to allow your employees to express intolerance on the job.  Make sure every employee knows that the store sells contraceptives, morning after pills, and medication that can cause abortions.  Accepting employment means understanding they may be required to handle and sell those products.  If they don't want to be involved with a company that does such things, they are welcome to find other employment.",

I think it's perfectly in line with the origional writing and later interpretations for them to say it says anything they want it to. And they're all *equally* as BS as each other.

Just stop for a minute inconsider all those billboards touting a heartbeat at 18 days. There was never a heartbeat to begin with, simply an electrical artifact created by an ultrasound - there couldn't be, because fetuses don't have heart valves at 18 days. \n\nAnd yet, how many states now have heartbeat bills?

But you can only sell to Christians, because by selling to other people you may be violating your beliefs. Don't worry, I'm sure your business will do just fine. After all, Christians won't be allowed to buy from non-Christian businesses, it would cause a conflict of beliefs. \n\nIf Christians want to live in a theocracy, they should be allowed to.

States would be left to decide whether to recognize them. There's all sorts of headaches this would cause Federally, if a state decided not to recognize another state's citizens having a legal marriage. \n\nBasically the Supreme Court is doing a smash and grab and overturning Federal protections on issues that Conservatives love to wage culture wars over. In practice a lot of these things are exceedingly popular, and even something as contentious as abortion has something like a 2/3ds support for some degree of access. Yet the Supreme Court overturning Roe was met with trigger laws or hasty legislation to nearly eliminate abortion outright in something like 20 states. \n\nThe other things on Thomas' list likely are even more popular (contraceptives, gay marriage, etc.) that Republican-led states are going to be risking something to try and overturn these things. And something like interracial marriage... which state risks going first? It's not going to go over well even if they force the issue through the legislature.",

The conservative white justices may not see her as their *equal*, but they do see her as their *colleague.* They could hardly miss her, since as the most junior justice, she will be responsible for some administrative matters that will keep her front and center in their operations as a group. SCOTUS justices are all acutely cognizant of how small their fraternity really is and the very large ways in which it is set apart from the rest of the country, even the rest of the judiciary. Even when they're at each other's throats, that sense doesn't entirely go away.\n\nThe thing about conservatives is that other people's struggles don't become real until those struggles are *their people's* struggles. I'm hopeful that the fact that two of the Justices are in interracial marriages might lead the court to simply refuse to take up any case that challenges Loving. If Alito forces the issue, though, then the court won't have any choice but to make interracial marriage illegal. The way Dobbs all but explicitly invites challenge on Obergefell and telegraphs what the decision there would have to be forces Loving to be subject to the same reasoning.\n\nAnd for context -- *I* am in an interracial marriage, so I'm not a disinterested observer, here. My spouse and I are already working with an attorney to make sure that we have durable medical and legal power of attorney for each other, as well as a will that does not rely in any way on us being legally married. We do see the writing on the wall and are taking steps to protect ourselves. I just hope that it won't be necessary, in the end.",

I would include pantyhose, women's shaving products, makeup, leggings, and hair dye in that as well.  I would not sell makeup to men or aftershave to women because they could potentially be trans.  \n\nI wouldn't sell Monster drinks cuz satan.  As a matter of fact I wouldn't sell any energy drinks just to be safe.\n\nI would limit the amount of candy/junk food to overweight people because of gluttony.  I wouldn't sell decks of cards because gambling is bad.  I'd go through all your pictures to make sure all were godly and remove the ones I deemed sinful and have my manager sell you those.\n\nI'd basically only sell faith based greeting cards and nick knacks, and guns and ammo magazines only.  More specifically, no confirmation cards or bar-mitzva cards cuz idol worshippers and \"they killed jesus\" respectively.\n\nAny I missed?",

Before any ideological debate, this clerk made Walgreens miss out on a sale and thus directly lose money, and potentially a customer (which, as far as Walgreens is concerned, represents more money). From a purely corporate standpoint, doesn't that qualify this guy as unfit for his job, and thus warrants termination of his employment? He wouldn't be getting fired for his faith (protected class yadaa yadaa), but simply for being unable/unwilling to perform his job?",
