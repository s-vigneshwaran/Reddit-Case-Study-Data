We have lots of evidence that women performed strenuous manual labor just like men did. Something they stopped doing once the agricultural revolution rolled in.",

I had low T due to medication I was on, it made me have low sex drive and I grew man-boobies.  \n\nThey gave me delatestryl shots once a week.  I got slightly more muscular, my man boobs went away, and I grew strange lone black hairs where there were no hairs before.  And I could do 20 pullups in a row.\n\nBut at no point did the shots ever make me feel more confident, or manly, or have more energy or a go-get-em attitude for dealing with the world.\n\nEventually I got off the medication, and as a result my natural testosterone shot through the roof.  I think at one point I was 36mg of something when the normal adult male range is 3-30mg.\n\nStill didn't get confident or manly.

The reason men go bald much more often than women is because men have much more testosterone. But a man with high testosterone isn't more likely to go bald than a man with low testosterone. They both have enough to trigger male pattern baldness, whereas women don't.\n\nSo going from female levels to male levels might make you go bald, but going from low male levels to high male levels won't. At most it will make it happen sooner, but whether it happens or not is genetic.",

As you can read in your pic, the upper testosterone is your total amount, which is unreliable because an uncertain amount is carried by a protein in your blood stream called SHBG (sex hormone binding globulin). When testosterone is bound and carried by SHBG, it is not active, and therefore not relevant to measure without having a result from SHBG. Your under bracket, free testosterone, is the relevant measure in this case. Which seems to be in the middle of the mean. Good on you for being healthy buddy!",

The packaged food industry will always choose ingredients based on profit rather than overall impact on the consumer. That usually means tons of empty calories to allow for lower-quality ingredients and longer-term storage. \n\nOne of the best examples I've seen is canned vegetable soup. Vegetable soup should be extremely low in calories and extremely high in vitamins and minerals. Because...it's vegetables, water, and some kind of stock. But you look at canned vegetable soup and it's essentially one step removed from junk food. That effect is happening with almost all packaged food. \n\nCooking everything yourself as a big meal prep, then freezing it, can be a pain in the ass at first. But I think long term most people would swear by it after seeing the impact on their health. Most people are essentially living on junk food without even realizing it.",

It's really easy to justify continuing them without stopping until the problem gets out of hand. Especially since they usually end up making you feel less energized, less aware, and more disappointment in yourself and your lackluster sex life.\n\nIk it's not a universal problem, but seeing so many admit to the problem made it obvious to me it wasn't having any positive effect on myself.

If you're a rodent, you 100% should never touch even one marijuana. \n\nIn all seriousness though, the study specifically mentions that they're using rodents because it's so difficult to test for all of this in the human brain. Weed has a lot of negative effects and a lot of positive effects. Most of the positives might be psychological, but I also wouldn't be alive right now without self-medication of marijuana, LSD, and magic mushrooms so all of this stuff is a mixed bag. That's why I said just don't do it all day.

You're not the first person to say this when I've shown this study to people.  You're wrong, but you're like the 5th person to say \"no it says it's only done on rodents!\" when what it says is \"these studies USED to only be done on rodents, here we did it on humans for the first time\":\n\n>Rodent studies show reversible downregulation of brain cannabinoid CB1 (cannabinoid receptor type 1) receptors after chronic exposure to cannabis. However, whether downregulation occurs in humans who chronically smoke cannabis is unknown. **Here we show, using positron emission tomography imaging, reversible and regionally selective downregulation of brain cannabinoid CB1 receptors in human subjects who chronically smoke cannabis.** \n\n>Study design\n\n>We admitted male chronic daily cannabis smokers to a closed and monitored in-patient research unit for ~4 weeks. We imaged cannabis smokers with PET and [18F]FMPEP-d2 at two time points\u2014namely, on the day following an evening admission and after ~4 weeks of abstinence. The time of first PET scan was chosen to maximize the effect size of the hypothesized downregulation while avoiding both acute intoxication and withdrawal symptoms. Healthy control male subjects underwent a single PET scan. \n\nSo why does this keep happening?  Do people just read the first sentence and then shut their brains off?",

We know frighteningly little about the brain even still. We're at the very forefront of understanding the genome and the wiring of our meat computers, so one study doesn't really bear a lot of weight on the subject.\n\nOnce again.. do this same study with alcohol.

A reason for this is that your testosterone level changes A LOT over time, even just throughout a day, it\u2019s not something stable that gives you meaningful information when compared to other people.

It\u2019s all \u201cgood\u201d. \n\nBut a male adult at 150, or at 4500 (like me) will absolutely be aware of the difference from normal/healthy levels. \n\nYou say it doesn\u2019t give more energy, which in terms of thermodynamics is true, that\u2019s calories. But having superhuman levels triggers epigenetic changes to do things like release more lipids from fat cells for more gluconeogenesis in the liver, more glucose uptake by muscles (that you can now use twice as much before exhaustion), deeper sleep for better recovery. That and more contributes to\u201d feeling energetic\u201d. \n\nSo it\u2019s reasonable to expect under dosed individuals to feel lethargic or depressed as their endocrine system is pathologic.",

You would never know without measuring it, which if it is low T then should get you sent to a pituitary CT scan for micro-adenomas.\n\n>but even then the value you will get doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\nYes it does.\n\n>A reason for this is that your testosterone level changes A LOT over time\n\nNo it doesnt. It doesnt fluctuate \"A LOT\". The differences are on the order of 5-10%. If you have very low T with associated symptoms  then an increase of 50% might not even make a difference in your life.\n\n>It\u2019s not a \u201cmale hormone\u201d where the more you have the more male or better you are.\n\nThe more T you have the more DHT you have which is the main androgenizing hormone in the body. Literally the more you have it the more male you become. \n\n>That\u2019s not at all how biology works.\n\nYou have no clue about biology or anything else so shut the fuck up",
