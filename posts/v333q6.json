That means all the evidence that she presented and so called witnesses, backing her up are lying. But this is not a criminal trial. The only criminal trails should come about the perjury she's committed in three countries now. She lied in Australia and suborned perjury about covering up her  sneaking her dogs into Australia. \nShe lied in the British trail of The Sun newspaper, where she was a witness, not the defendant about donating all her alimony money to charity. The judge in that case even mentioned her donation as evidence of her honesty when ruling in the Sun's favour.\n\nNow here's the trail in the US where she now denies statements she made under oath in her 2016 deposition, and constantly contradicts her own earlier statements in this trial, while insisting that everybody else us lying. \n\nThree countries, potentially three perjury trials. I do hope Virginia does takes action against her obvious and disgraceful lying under oath.",

I can't imagine a better basis for a legal system. Imagine being such a despot that you'd want to destroy the foundations of a just system of trial by jury because you aren't able to convince a jury of the validity of your claims. This is the scariest part of the feminist movement because it wants to eradicate one of the pillars of modern democracies and replace it with something completely despotic. If given the opportunity they'd have Stalinist show trials against \"male abusers\" in place of what we have now and the bar for getting a male convicted of domestic violence is already pretty low (at least in my country), if you so much as put a woman in fear that you are going to do something to them without actually doing anything to them you can be convicted of having committed domestic vioence, that can be something as little as raising your voice or saying something bad to a woman. Funny enough I never see these feminists ever say anything about the justice system in places like Iran where the entire system is ACTUALLY explicitely anti-woman, its almost like they don't actually care about oppression of women.  \n\n\nAlso \"justicenopeace\"? Are they really using that hashtag? Like what are they gonna do? Stage a violent inssurection because Amber Heard didn't get her way in court? These people are really mad.",

Amber Heard is a liar and most women, like most men, are decent people who aren't out to cause harm in the lives of others. Amber didn't do a disservice to women, she did a disservice to herself. The fact that she was an advocate for abused women didn't help her cause. She's not much different from anti-gay Republicans who get caught fucking male prostitutes in that regard. That feminist women are jumping to this train of thought just shows how they evaluate the world they live in by projecting their neurotic fascination with victimhood onto half the population while trying to maintain their crumbling narrative.",
