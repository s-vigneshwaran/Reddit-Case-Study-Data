  "text": "TIFU by dumping a beautiful girl over her \"smell\" during sex\nI had my first gf when i was 19, everything was great, she's a beautiful blonde with blue eyes and had a great personality.\n\nAfter a few months of dating she told me that she will come visit me at work (a secluded place where no one can see or hear us) we both knew the we're going to have sex for the first time that evening.\n\nSo i went out and bought a fresh pack of condoms.\nWhen she came things heated up and we took of our cloths, but suddenly i stared smelling a horrible smell that turned me off completely, i didn't went to disappoint so we had sex anyway but i definitely did not enjoy it.\n\nIn the following days i thought that i will never enjoy having sex with her again, and so i broke up with her (i was young and stupid i know)\n\nThree years later, last week, i had used the same brand of condoms and stared smelling EXACTLY the same smell, and realized that the beautiful girl i used to date wasn't stinky - the condoms were.\n\nI feel like I've made the stupidest mistake of my life.\n\n\nTL:DR i broke up with a a beautiful girl because i thought she was stinky during sex.\nIt turns out, the condoms we used were stinky not the girl.\n\nEdit: wow im getting alot of hate from people, most of it is deserved - what i did was not ok.\nBut please keep in mind that i was 19 and stupid i didn't analyze this too much i just had a bad experience and jumped to conclusions.\n\nJust to add a few missing details in the post \n1. I broke up with her respectfully, i didn't tell her it was due to the smell\n2. The brand off condoms we used is durax (a few people messaged me with the exact same problem. So i guess there are people who are more sensitive to the smell of durax products)\n3. Alot of people suggest contacting her and apologize - i agree, i doubt we will be a couple again but she deserves to know why i broke up with her.",

Newman later mentions he made a lot of money from this arrangement, but won't tell Kramer any of the details. Kramer becomes obsessed with learning Newman's secret.\n\nAfter following Newman for a few days as he suspiciously completes his mail route (which isn't like him), Kramer eventually gets frustrated and confronts him. Newman spills the beans. Newman tried to sell the condoms but his buyers were also repulsed by the smell, so he took the condoms to the pier to burn them. They smelled even worse as they burned, so Newman fled to the street to get some fresh air.\n\nJust as he was getting into his mail van, an agent from the EPA questions Newman about the smell, so he makes up a story about \"some guys\" burning something on the pier as he was delivering mail. As it turns out, the condoms contained some kind of prohibited chemical and Newman received a $100 reward for reporting an environmental hazard.\n\nOf course, Kramer then wants a cut - a \"finder's fee\" for supplying the tainted condoms.",

George on the other hand had an episode that was specifically about having trouble putting on a condom, and I don't remember but it may or not have been the same \"Sponge worthy\" episode  where elaine is particular about her protective sex methods.\n\nThat being said, the\"dirtiest\" Seinfeld episode was the one where they make a pact who can hold out masturbating the longest, but even then it was mostly implied and the show never mentioned the word. I feel like a tongue condom would be almost too kinky, but if it did do it, it would be an Elaine episode. Just my two cents.",

Then you know if you're cleared for landing on the strip, with zero embarrassing scenarios. And then you bury your face in there like you're bobbing for apples and your life depends on it.",

Assuming a healthy situation where all parties involved truly want to be there and truly want to get to smashing, here is a \n\n**SIMPLE GENDER-NEUTRAL FOREPLAY FORMULA:**\n\n1. Remember which non-genital bits on your own human body are sensitive, ticklish, give you the ol\u2019 tingles, etc.\n\n2. Work those areas on your partner using a light touch with hands and/or mouth.\n\n3. Monitor their reactions for feedback: leaning into it indicates \u201cyes please;\u201d pulling back indicates \u201cno thank you.\u201d\n\n4. Take the Good feedback & continue on the \u201cyes please\u201d areas, gradually increasing in intensity.\n\n5. Eventually, genitals will naturally get into the mix.\n\nThe main takeaway is: If your goal is a mutually enjoyable Good Time where everyone walks away happy, don\u2019t just dive right at anyone\u2019s genitals straight out the gate. If your own genitals are shouting at you to go straight for the OTHER genitals, ignore your genitals for a little while and follow the steps above.\n\n(For Step 1, if you haven\u2019t thought about what the sensitive areas on your own human body are and you need some guidance: generally widespread non-genital Hot Spots include lips, ears/neck/shoulders, nipples/breasts/pecs, and inner thighs.)\n\n**TL;DR:** Start with a good old-fashioned make-out sesh, and pay attention to what they lean in for. That\u2019s basic foreplay; do that, *then* smash.\n\nEdit: All of this can also be accomplished/augmented by spoken words that come out of both of your mouths indicating whether something is Good or Nah. If you know yourself to freeze up and go along out of a wish to please other people, or if you know yourself to be bad at reading human body language, use your words.",

Do you tell all the men and women what sex acts are permissible and which aren't, and how to correctly please their partners with sex acts they might feel uncomfortable with?",

Not one time has a woman ever said dang, I wish you would just skip the foreplay and plop it in. Maybe you need some advice? I woman needs to be turned on. And you should do whatever you can to get her I. The mood. If she doesn\u2019t like being eaten out? Cool. Then you don\u2019t have to. But I have never been with one that has said don\u2019t. Also, you should be with someone who matches your libido, and desires. If you are unhappy with your sex life, then there are plenty of options to make it better. Im not saying that chicks need to suck dicks. Females are not turned on the same way as men are. No one says that because of what I am saying, more ducks need to be sucked.  It you can get a lot further with a woman, and her enjoyment can be increased tenfold if men would actually try to turn them on before plopping it in. And turning her on does not start with instantly going down on her. That\u2019s a later stage to the foreplay. Quit being so quick to judge my comment.",

Thats how I feel anyways. Every partner I've ever had, including my current gf, I've told \"I'm not attracted to short hair and I dont like body hair, so if you dont shave or if you cut your hair short, I will probably be less attracted to you.\" The same way that if I gained 300 pounds that would probably change how attracted they are to me. Again, physical attracting is *just as important* as any other type of compatibility in a relationship. \n\nI've never been met with a response other than \"oh okay, cool, thanks for letting me know.\" There isn't anything wrong with people having preferences and things that they do and do not find attractive. Most people would rather style themselves to look like what their SO is attracted to than do whatever they want at the detriment to their own compatibility; I know I sure would. I hate having a beard, but every girl I've ever dated has said they prefer me with facial hair, so I wear my facial hair. Their happiness and them being attracted to me is more important to me than my face being a little itchy and uncomfortable for myself. I'd rather look like what they are into than what I want, because it's a very small sacrifice to make for someone im supposed to love. \n\nBut I guess that makes me a piece of shit and a terrible partner. All because I have the audacity to have preferences and be open and honest about those preferences with someone who is supposed to be my trusted partner in life. Fuck me, right?\n\nWhats funny is that outside of the internet, literally no one gives a fuck about someone else having preferences. Most people are willing to shave their pubes or not cut their hair or do the very minor things that their partner finds sexy just because it makes the person they love happy. But on the internet that apparently is far too much to ask and makes someone an abusive, horrible spouse. Lmao.",

Please.\n\nValuing looks as a starter for a relationship isn't gross or unnatural. And I doubt it was the only thing, but it's what he remembers vividly. It isn't doomed just because he thought she was stunning and was really excited about sex with his \"dream girl,\" as it sounds. He was 19. In any case, raging hormones don't typically drive people to consider personality, for both sexes, especially at that age. He thought she was hot, she probably thought the same. They wanted to have sex. Sounds natural to me.\n\nShave your neckbeard. Dumbass.",

Ended up with a really good boyfriend who fvcked like a champ and treated me really well. Oh and we had sex the first night we met (we'd said hi in passing though). Because he knocked on my door (we were neighbors) on a snowy night with a bottle of brandy and asked if I wanted a drink. Chad wannabes don't even do that. They just expect insta-sex. My neighbor had planned and plotted and got the girl. We lasted almost a year and the sex was amazing.",

For me it really does not seem like any effort at all to bring a bottle of wine, or make a home cooked meal. This seems to demonstrate effort beyond 90% of men in the dating pool and it's honestly shocking how easy it is to do.\n\nThere are outliers as with everything, but most of the time guys complaining about women being so hard and complicated are actually just inconsiderate and lazy",

It's not high effort by any means to bring a bottle. It's just that the mood was so right and he was someone I had been interested in getting to know for several months and vice versa. It has to unfold somehow, and he chose the perfect snowy night and cherry brandy to introduce himself properly. I was impressed, and as I said we lasted a year. It was my first real relationship and it taught me a lot. Lots of guys will waste your time at that age but he wanted romance and more then just sex. It was really a nice time in my life, you know what I mean if you ever get lucky enough to be with someone you can count as your best friend too.",

It's also noteworthy that women wipe well after both number 1 and number 2 because the urine will rinse the vulva and labial folds when women pee due to surface tension. So through the day a woman's vulva is constantly being rinsed and wiped (yes with urine, and it's wiped) and during a shower the surface tension will also rinse the labia folds with water. For a thorough clean you want to wash the pubic hair and outer area really well. For the vulva and labial folds you do a thorough rinse with only water, NO WASHING WITH SOAP there. Washing actually causes a bad smell because it's a whole ecosystem of good bacteria and flora also that can BURN holy shit. \n\nThe inner fold of the vulva and vagina is not regular skin, it's a mucus membrane (like the inside of your cheek) that cleanses itself. Sure it can get sweaty and stinky and should be thoroughly rinsed and the outside should be washed, but it's not nearly as bad as you might imagine.",

No one wants to go through 3-4 condoms and switch them out throughout intercourse.\n  \nHonestly you might as well recommend being vegan, going to the gym every day, and flossing, because it's obvious that putting the barrier of a condom between two people will improve blocking any STIs. All I'm saying is it's a pain in the ass, and they're not worth the trouble if you and your partner just get regular tests, which is honestly way more important.",

The goal is to save up enough to retire before you're too sick or disabled to continue working, which lowers your survivability. Having a high quality of life is a bonus. And if you're really lucky, maybe someday you can buy your freedom while you're still young and healthy enough to enjoy it. You just distract yourself with hobbies or causes to motivate you to keep going, otherwise you're only working to live another day just to work some more for a system that doesn't reward you beyond the minimum.\n\nBy the time you have any real financial security your mental or physical health will begin failing you. When you are in your 30s you'll start awakening in the night with existential dread as you realize it's all for nought and feel impending doom as the clarity of your mortality hits your soul. The realization of the uselessness and meaninglessness of life will consume you, which will eventually lead you to start working for a cause or embrace spirituality in order to feel that purpose. In the end, you will realize each day in your life became less happy, with a few spikes here and there, and that ultimately pain will eventually consume everything. Until then, you will find trivial things to create some happiness in your life, as it's really all you have. And if you can find someone to do it with whose company you enjoy, then even better.",

I'm not talking about the fact that men work physically and workout to take care of their bodies 20 times more than women- so they smell sweaty more often than women , that's true but beside the point. women don't just put up with that smell, many are even attracted to the pheromones in us men's sweat because they're biologically attracted to masculine strong men and sweat comes along with that territory. up until about 80 years ago - a single lifetime - most men and women couldn't even shower everyday if they wanted to. so men smelling a little sweaty from working has been a thing for all of time up until now. it's natural. \n\n\nwhat's not natural is a putrid smelling vagina. the vagina cleans itself, so if it smells bad it's bc the woman's eats mountains of disgusting food, doesn't shower or wipe her smegma off the outside of her vagina or doesn't wipe or clean after she uses the bathroom or bleeds from her vagina during her period so she gets diseases growing inside of her and if a man can stand the smell enough to have sex with her then he'll contract an sexually transmitted infection. that's why we've evolved to avoid you girls if your vagina smells bad just like no girl wants to sleep with a guy if his penis is dirty. \n\n\nnobody's attracted to those smells , even women critisize other women when they can smell their vagina odor. this was a problem in my old work office, there were lazy overweight women who apparently didn't shower and developed vaginal bacterial infections and fungus growing from between their legs so bad that HR had to get involved, especially when they wore skirts, it made everyone want to throw up. trust me disgusting women are much more disgusting than disgusting men. \n\n\nyou probably just have a bias against men since your daddy didn't pay for your overpriced university and you thought you deserved it like your [post history](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/s31z91/fathers_and_financial_aid/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) says, so you hate him and extend that hate to all men. \n\n\nor maybe you have a bias against men since you hear men's voices in your head when you do drugs like your [post history](https://www.reddit.com/r/high/comments/vctxr4/high_and_spooked/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) says, so who knows maybe some of your negative experiences with men haven't even happened and it's all in your head. \n\n\nit's not like this is the first time you've talked [sexist shit against men](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/w6tfv6/i_feel_like_shit_because_im_not_curvy/ihg75x4?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) all because you're upset that your boobs or butt are too small so most men aren't attracted to you. sad. \n\n\nmaybe if you deal with your daddy issues, your drug issues and your body issues instead of blaming all men for your own greed, entitlement and genetics then you'll cure your bigotry:) good luck my girl",

Because you should be aware of your partner and what they're experiencing, especially when they're of the opposite sex and go through very different experiences.\n\nFurthermore, my first thought when OP mentioned that she had a bad smell was that she might have an infection or worse down there and might need to visit the doctor. I didn't know any better, and my concern about another person caused me to do some research. Ignorance isn't an excuse, and you especially can't use it as an excuse when you do shit like what OP did which is **not communicating**.",

However, if you're only in the game for the candy the expect some health problems (STIs). I don't need a lot of sex, I'm not that horny, so I much rather go out with someone I believe I can have a stable relationship with because I actually like them instead of bouncing around collecting STIs like it's a card game. \n\nThat being said, I also don't look down on people who get in a relationship just for the sex. I can understand not seeing someone anymore if the sex was bad in the case. However, those relationships should be upfront and both people should know what's going on. This doesn't appear to be the case with OP who spent months in the relationship before the sex. Seems like they wanted a sexual relationship and not much more so they buttered someone up with a few months of dating just to get in their pants then dropped them like a sack of potatoes afterwards.",

I'd advise experimenting if you can find such options in a quality brand with good smell profile and lubrication. Also lubrication makes so much difference. If your favourite brand lacks it, buy a good lubricant. Both parties will enjoy more.",

First off, sex ed wasnt as accessible as it is today, his first sexual experience. Why are we forgetting that part? Woman having smelly vags was something I heard growing up. If I had smelled something like that the first time I got laid, I probably would have thought the same.\n\nObviously with the wisdom and confidence we can look back and laugh at him, but really? Calling him a bad guy and talking about how the girl is much better off? What complete nonsense.\n\nSeriously, everyone saying that during their very first sexual experience, they would have been totally comfortable stopping the action to investigate an odd smell, yall just lying.",

You didnt say those specific words, but your comment had no point other than to criticize, so you can split hairs if you want, but I'm not going to.\n\n>Not everyone has the same experience as you \n\nFunny enough, that was literally my point. We shouldn't judge this kid for not knowing where the smell was coming from, for being too embarrassed to address it, or for how he handled it. He was an inexperienced kid that didnt know how to handle it. Goal was to limit the embarrassment, that was all his 19 year old brain was thinking about. I remember feeling that way and am sure many do. I can't relate with smelling a foul stench during sex and breaking up with my girlfriend because of it. I can relate with beling so afraid of embarrassing myself or others that I made a bad decision. This is called empathy. OPs lack of it caused him to ghost a girl when he was 19. Your lack of it caused you to make an un-needed mean comment to a person that was trying to make others laugh by admitting they made a mistake as a teen. \n\n\n>Don\u2019t copy paste your comments at me.\n\nToo late :(",

If you find that you're happy around someone but can't identify what it is about them that draws you to them, that would typically mean it's infatuation rather than a deep emotional connection. \n\nBut, in the case of what you describe, it could be that there are things about their personality that you find really attractive but simply haven't solidly identified yet. Do you like her wit? Her smarts? Her kindness? Her perspective on the world? If any of that rings true, you're probably on the right track. And if not, especially if you're young, infatuation isn't the worst thing in the world. Just go with it and see where it takes you. Best of luck friend!",

I don't really get why because if you said those things about me, I would be very flatered. \n\nAlso, I think we should give people more slack when they are not super articulate about something. Being eloquent is hard enough on its own, it's even harder when it's about things that are a little vague in our own mind, things we did not take the time to analyse. If you top that with concepts that are just complicated to express, that leave you speechless and I don't think it's a bad thing in itself. \n\nIt might become bad if you really can't say anything after thinking about it, which is not your case since you said those nice things about her",

I didn't bring it up and ignored it, but it kind of ruined it a little. \n\nA few days later we were at it again. I again kept turning her over for different positions. Then I heard the fart sound. I stopped and finally asked if she had a stomach problem. She laughed hard, confused I asked what is she laughing at. She asked if i thought she farted, I replied well it sounded like it. She said it was her vagina. She pointed out that I kept \"examining\" her that air escapes after I switched her over fast. We both laughed after I told her I held my breath last time.",

You could smell her just from being close to her and cuddling with clothes on. I thought this was totally normal.\n\nWe dated for 3 years and broke up.  Then I had a random hookup. Then started dating a different girl. None of these girls smelled.  I talked to some of my friends about it.  They told me that ya, maybe a little bit of an odor was normal. But what I was describing with my first gf was a fishy stench.  That's when it finally hit me that this girl probably had an unaddressed medical condition, and neither of us knew it was abnormal.",

For some, sex becomes much less frequent, much more work physically, libido deteriorates for someone in the relationship, you have kids, and your body just starts to lose control over things you had control over previously. Like the ability to hold in a fart for example. Sex is great but it also can be pretty gross sometimes, especially when one of you accidentally fart while you're into it. Imagine waiting a few weeks or a month for sex and then you end up ripping ass during it, hard to recover from that. \n\nAlso, run your finger in the area under your balls and take a sniff. Yeah women have a scent, that's true, but damn they gotta put up with our frumunda cheese. They have the raw end of the deal in my opinion.",

If you go down and it smells bad don't lick, just finger for a bit and then pretend that you can't get hard, it'll defuse the situation immediately. Condoms always smell bad regardless of the brand btw. But sometimes you just mess up and it's normal. One time I finally got the chance to be with a girl that I had been crushing on for years, I guess I got so excited I couldn't get it up! She did the whole \"it's ok, oh I gotta go now\" thing and I regret working myself up too much. Not related to your experience, all I'm saying is to not be upset about this.

Fun, sweet, kinky in all the right ways... but after a few years, if I went deep (I'm a long boy), thered be this smell. It was like death, but it wasn't always there. Im not stupid, I know that bodies sometimes have an odor, but it was a lot for both of us. It got worse over time, eventually it got to the point where I couldn't keep it up unless my face was away from her p*****. Dr's couldn't figure it out, they kept saying they couldnt see anything and gave her antibiotics that would make a difference for like a month at best.\n\nObviously I felt like absolute shit for this whole situation, nobody should feel bad about their body like that. \n\nWe were starting to worry that something about our chemistry wasn't working out anymore, or that I couldn't stand her natural smell now out of nowhere.  It had been at least a year by this point. We were starting to question whether or not things were going to work out in the relationship, sex is a HUGE component in relationships for me.\n\nFast forward to a threeway we had a month or two after we opened our relationship (for unrelated reasons).  Our friend is slowly slipping more and more of their fingers inside her until she's being fully fisted. Im playing with her too, and we get her to the point of back-archung pleasure. Then, right as she practically screams in pleasure, I hear the friend say \"huh?\" and pull their hand out. Inside the hand?  Her IUD, but with a goddamn ball of hairs wrapped around the end. Turns out not only was it the cause of the smell, it's apparently COMMON but they don't tell you about it when it's being inserted. \n\nTL;DR : Love of my life's parts start smelling really bad, after a year or two we have a 3-way and do her gyno's job for him by accidentally removing her IUD and the attached hairball causing the infection.\n\nEdit for spelling and to add a detail.",

I figured hey some women have strong smells but it was not going away. I tried a second time after I told her about it and she said she was offended and she takes showers. The second time it was the same smell. I am completely turned off and personality she's great we get along and she cooks for me and is feminine but that's a deal breaker. I just want my ex back.

I think she just wasnt ready for a relationship, amd being with somebody who wasn't consistently down on themselves like she was, made her symptoms worse. She is much happier by herself. I'm pretty sure she came out as asexual too, so I feel that might have been something she was struggling with coming to terms with while she was with me, as she definitely didnt tell me about it during our relationship.",

I genuinely feel like those were the MVP, later she would tell me that it was the best sex she had ever had. And I wasn't that experienced, so it was the condoms. But not totally, they just amplified an already exciting and intense moment. \n\nLife is all about perspective, and if I could go back and change things.. There's so many aspects of my life right now that wouldn't exist, and I'm not the type of person to look to the past and forget the future, quite the opposite actually.",
