Not to mention having less power and ability to be able to achieve goals and do the things I want to do. Nobody wants to give that up after they've had a taste of the lifestyle.\n\nWe all understand that because nearly everyone has been in the situation where they went from having a comfortable supply of money to not having enough and it's a difficult adjustment to make.\n\nThey also have a hard time leaving their cushy six figure (or even just five figure) career jobs to work in fast food and other menial jobs.

Metrication was also a requirement for joining the EEC - however that didn't mean you could only sell in Metric units, it just meant that Metric units had to be displayed next to Imperial units.\n\nThe main driver for the change came in the 1980s when petrol prices rose. While the pumps of the time could be switched between Metric and Imperial - so as to meet the Metrication requirements - the pumps couldn't display a value over 99.9 per unit. So when petrol looked to rise above \u00a31 per gallon the retailers, seeing the writing on the wall, asked if they could sell in litres as it meant they could keep the pumps in service longer. Many pumps were changed in the late 80s, certainly most by the early 90s. \n\nBut it wasn't a Statutory requirement until 30 September 1995, by which time all the old pumps had been replaced and only displayed litres anyway.",

Someone designs a length of and the builders use metric when building it, but then you have to put up imperial distance signs. You buy your fuel in quantities of liters but the range of your automobile is quoted in miles per gallon and speed is often measured in miles per hour. Once you start getting into food things get really nuts because you'll sometimes see \u00a3/kg vs \u00a3/lb. For gods sake see y'all still use Stone as a measure of human weight and the only real conversion for stone is into pounds, and when measuring distance as a height you use inches and feet instead of meters and centimeters. \n\nHere in America we might be stupid for using the imperial system but at least we're consistent in our stupidity. Also just because we like to be assholes about it there's actually two different definitions of the United States gallon there's a dry and a wet.",

On that litre you pay 21% VAT, so to extract that VAT to get to the underlying price: 2.184/1.21 = 1.807.  \nThis Year, the excise on petrol is 82\u00a2, so subtract this and you get \u20ac0.986 per litre, about \u20ac3.73 per gallon.  \nWhich seems okay until you realise that the dollar is weaker than the Euro, and so the actual price you're paying is $4.24 per gallon, so we are still more expensive even in terms of base fuel price, by a significant margin if we assume tha your prices also have duty and taxes on them as well.",

The vast majority of miles driven by Americans on a daily basis is done within metropolitan regions that are ripe for transit expansion.

If there's more EVs than expected then there's more road usage by those not paying for it so you need to tax EVs for upkeep of the roads they're using.\n\nNot all taxes are punitive, some of them you just need to be able to upkeep infrastructure. For example, no one is trying to incentivise people to make less money by enforcing income tax - it's just without it we wouldn't have any infrastructure.",

Truck drivers are especially bad because those things cost a lot, enough that they can definitely afford an EV or at least hybrid instead, and most of them are just driving around cities with 6L engines for absolutely no reason.

I am from Texas, and we pump our own gas.\n\nMy first time stopping for gas in NJ, I turn the car off and open the door, I turned my head to ask my wife a question before standing up and getting out. I turn my head back and there's some hoodlum with a chain around his neck leaning into my car through the open door. He says\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\nI says\n\n\"What do YOU want?\"\n\nI thought he might be a hobo or meth head wanting something from me, and so we are staring each other down like something is about to go down.\n\nThe stare down went on longer than it should have, because whilst this is happening my wife has begun laughing so hard she can't breathe or speak.\n\nEventually she squeaks out  - between uncontrollable fits of laughter -\"We're from Texas... We pump our own gas...\"\n\nThen he said \"Oh, what kind of gas do you want?\"\n\nAll was well after that, but the first minute or two of getting gas in NJ was very tense.",

If the person at the pump is indeed driving a 16-yr old vehicle (if not older, since manufacturers begin producing models the previous year), it is entirely possible that they cannot afford to purchase something more fuel efficient.\n\nI'll put it this way: in my neck of the woods, 87 octane is currently $3.25/gal. The per-capita income is about $24k. It was a lot easier to live when gas was $1.75.\n\nIts easy to gripe about gas and blame Biden because for years the American people have been fed propaganda that whatever ills the country faces is the president's fault: first it was Bush, then Obama, then Trump, and now Biden.",

The only conservative beliefs I have, are in economic policy, in good times a country should huidn up cash and trim the balance sheet and in bad times expand it and spend cash to support the eocnomy. Outside of those tow times the budget should be balanced. The second is I like guns. I think getting a gun should have some more hurdles like a physical and mental fitness test for your first purchase and then another one down the road. Last range I went to a guy was shooting and had a heart attack. The rest of my beliefs in edu, abortion, women's rights, etc make me a liberal. \n\nMy older brother thinks he a republican but isn't. He's taken on bad examples from my very right wing relatives in New Hampshire (wanted to go to DC on Jan 6th) and those around him. He lives in Madison, Wi and only reads Fox News. He bitches about the college kids despite it being the heart of his city. When I ask him his beliefs in certain issues, he believes the liberal side of things minus abortion (he's religious) and then will bitch about liberals being scum. Funny enough, he thinks as a nation we should have less access to guns. In the past 2 or 3 years of him living in Wisconsin I've seen the transformation take place. It's really disheartening. He used to be able to get along with anybody and is now low-key racist. We were going somewhere in our hometown, he turned to me in a quiet voice goes, \"they don't belong here\", trying to quietly point at a black family. He thought absolutely nothing of it as I'm sitting here disgusted. \n\nMy older brother is on the spectrum so seeing this junk day in and day out really impressed upon him that his beliefs aren't correct nsd he should change. He tricks himself into thinking he's changed when in reality he hasn't and is confused. How I see this is when he will say \"I hate liberals\" instead of \"how can you be a liberal\". 4+ years ago he would have asked the around question. It's really disheartening to see and even worse knowing how impressionable he is. \n\n>[bidens] he\u2019s the figure head of it all that s why they go out on him.\n\nI agree he's the figurehead of all of this and will get blame from ignornant Americans. My brother has a god damn college degree and he's talking like a high schooler. He's paid for an education that's supposed to make him better, at one point he loved to learn, that's changed since moving to Madison. Even my wife sees it, which confirms that I'm not just making this up in my head. He's acting absolutely ignorant with these blanket statements, he knows it too.\n\n\nEdit: I guess I am still annoyed at this whole situation.\n\nAdded some punctuation and fixed spelling errors.",

High fuel prices mean people are doing less driving and that is great for planet earth. The very first thing President Biden did when he took office was to shut down the keystone pipeline and cancel drilling leases on federal land and add many regulations to make it harder to start new drilling projects. This has cut domestic production of oil by 32% and higher gas prices, it\u2019s a good start but he needs to get prices up to $7 or 8 a gallon to really make people stop driving around in their big SUV\u2019s, boat\u2019s, RV\u2019s, etc. this is what is needed to save our planet. Under Trump he was drilling like crazy and gas was as low as $1.30 a gallon and people we just driving around like there was no tomorrow, spewing pollution all over the place and destroying our world. President Biden has made basically everything more expensive and again that\u2019s a good thing because people can\u2019t afford to buy as much crap and making that crap causes massive pollution. He has also made all forms of energy more expensive so people will turn the lights off, lower the thermostat and use less energy. So people you need to stop complaining and stand with our president and with Democrats if we are to save earth",

But part of it would have been setting up live streaming cameras to catch whoever did it.\n\nAnd for the record, I still stand by that idea. It\u2019s Midland/Odessa, TX. Full of rednecks from around the country, and they would genuinely lose their shit if they saw a BLM billboard. If anyone wants to actually try and make it happen, I\u2019m more than happy to recommend which billboard locations would be the most effective.",

So is the rest of education policy. Healthcare. Food stamps. Environmental issues. These are decidedly left-leaning issues, not because the Democrats talks about them, but because the Republicans refuse to.  Not just refuse to, but adamantly *get in the way and block people from getting access to the things they need*. It's an \"I've got mine so fuck you\" attitude. All while preaching family values and Christian love.\n\nPoliticians are politicians, there are very few that I trust, and only because I agree with their voting history.\n\nThis isn't about politics as politics stands. This is about doing right by your neighbors, both on a micro and macro level.",

[The forecast is](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46776) that that negative net quantity will continue to decline.\n\n> If only\n\nIf only *what*? We're here, now what does that change for you? For the country? The single biggest determinant of prices at the gas pump come from gasoline futures trading--short and long hedge positions and speculation.\n\n> Biden get elected, and now have to pay 3.40 to sometimes 3.50 per gallon.\n\nA great number of things drives the pump pricing up and down. The biggest practical event driving the recent increase in gas prices is demand, although yes, taxes have risen slightly. Whatever effects Biden has had on fuel prices have been incidental and indirect. If we consume less, prices will fall. There will be other events that push price up and down.\n\nYou're right that gas prices are higher now than they have been in a while, and it's true that some of the [economic policies put forward by the Biden administration](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/23/politics/joe-biden-gas-price-fact-check/index.html) have contributed to that, but it simply isn't true that there's a one-to-one correlation there. Some of those policies have been instrumental in keeping the US from experiencing runaway inflation--something that still isn't fully under control. The pandemic drove fuel demand down to such an extent that many refineries were shut down. When demand started rising, refinery capabilities were reduced, and that'll take a long time to fully recover from.\n\nOPEC engages in gigantic manipulation of gas futures. When prices get too low for them, they cut production. Fucking stupidity, but most people favor short-term gains over long-term benefits. (incidentally, Trump's administration was part of that production cut, not that it really fucking matters who was involved.) If your political opinions demand that Biden was directly responsible, then go for it. You'll be wrong, but you'll be rooting for your team.",

He might have taken actions that could apply some pressure on the market, but it would have been mostly incidental. I don't think the US's participation in the Paris Agreement has much of a direct impact on pricing. Pulling out was ridiculous. It was a high school-level \"negotiation tactic.\" He took his ball and went home. One way or another, we're going to be forced to confront our many massive pollution-generating industries. Doing it sooner would be a lot less traumatic than later.\n\nTrump was such a loose cannon that he could have done anything, depending on his mood and his childish thinking. All sorts of things might impact petrochemical industries, but I don't think it would be intentional, with that goal of lowering gas prices at the pump. I don't think that Trump or any of the economists he might have briefly allowed into his clubhouse would have done anything to reduce costs to consumers for anything. He simply doesn't regard subsistence living as relevant. He's had no contact with anyone with worries about money on that level. If 10 of his constituents were on fire, not only would he not bother to piss on them to put it out, he'd wouldn't give it a moment's thought.",

Coordinated sticker campaigns across the US to spread simple disinformation about gas prices and garner more distracted resentment for Biden based on literally nothing (these stickers started making their rounds in January 2021, before he had any way to affect gas). The fact that there are so many people willing to act as free agents of this very organized propaganda campaign is chilling (it isnt limited to the gas price thing, consider how the right is pro russia because the lies about bidens corruption withthe ukraine).\n\nThe left is responding to the organized and well funded push towards right wing extremism, and theyre responding very poorly. The damage done by Trump to American social cohesion is incomparable. The consequences of his policies, the reorientation of US foreign and domestic policy to enrich himself and the super rich, alongside total erosion of democratic norms, is incomparable.

And how countries produce oil based on percieved future demand? and the demand fell so low that crude oil went NEGATIVE? Because the refineries were so backed up the crude had nowhere to go so they were paying people to take it? so the cut production immediatly. Now we are feeling the effects and no one wants to increase production because the are trying to recoup their losses. And he said I didnt know what I was talking about because we used to be energy independent we made all our own oil and exported it now we import most of it cuz our production fell 50% (in one year). Crazy what a daily diet of propoganda does to your critical thinking....",

They talk like its a democratic conspiracy and I try and point out that it's affecting every country and those countries have their own complex internal politics.

Like OPEC and Russia producing oil (or not producing) influences prices, global shipping, global demand, the effects of alternative energy production on price.  The fact that compared to the rest of the world our gas prices are super cheap because of government subsidies... nope its biden and the pipeline BS.  I've watched Fox news interview the head of the energy dept and they threw these talking points out at him, when he tried to disprove them, they just talked over him and threw more one liners at him and he looked like his head was going to explode",

Even if we doubled our domestic production, that would only raise total worldwide production from ~96 million barrels/day to ~107 million barrels/day, for a total oil price decrease of ~10%. And oil only contributes about ~59% of the total price of gasoline (other components are refining, transport, retail, etc). So even a ~10% oil price reduction would only result in a ~6% gas price reduction, at best.",

The demand needs to come first before they will invest a crazy amount to hire workers (which is expensive) and ramp up production (also expensive). \n\nNow that it looks like the demand is here to stay, it's in their best interest to start increasing supply. The market determines the price after that.

Currently OPEC is  trying to increase production but are having problems. You know like Russia. Now the US oil sector, which for the last decade or so has been able to quickly react to high oil prices via fracking, is also dragging behind. This has nothing to do with corporate greed. It has to do with lack of investment. Investors don't want to give money to frackers as they have been bitten before and are sick of the insane boom and bust cycle that occurs with fracking. What typically happens is the frackers go crazy during the boom phase, and once this massive amount of oil hits the market the price collapses and oil price plummets. Lots of these investments go bad, and investors lose their shirts. And yes some investment banks have simply moved away from oil and gas because of climate change. Other energy investments such as solar and wind do actually pay for themselves, and are seen as a better (if nowhere as exciting) investment. That's the general state of the oil industry, but \"Exxon is making oil expensive!\" is simply incorrect. If anything Exxon is making oil expensive because they shitcanned everyone during the pandemic and cant raise near enough money to drill. (the same goes for all the other oil majors)",

You're going to get the stereotypical GM interior which was designed by a committee of accountants, but barring some design flaw the thing should last you 200,000 miles if you take care of it. \n\n\nOtherwise you have the Chevy Malibu that starts at about 24,000. \n\n\nFord doesn't make a Sedan anymore, and they have no plans to replace the 2021 Mustang with a new model so they don't even make muscle cars anymore. \n\n\nVolkswagen still sells the Jetta which starts at 19,000. Although it does have a dinky 1.4 liter engine that somehow justifies a turbo charger. Reliability dubious. \n\n\nThe cheapest Corolla still starts at 20,500. Honda's cheapest car isn't a Civic, somehow, but instead the HR-V. A small crossover SUV. Mazda's cheapest is the Mazda 3 which still starts at 20,800. \n\n\nMitsubishi does still sell the Mirage, which is roughly comparable to the Chevy Spark, but good luck finding a Mitsubishi dealership in the US still. \n\n\nCompanies don't sell sedans because Americans have been pushed into a false decision by a slew of shitty regulations that make an SUV look safe and a sedan dangerous. Which is a bit of a problem because sedans are getting dangerous *because* of SUV's, and SUV's are only rated as safe because US regulations care about what happens to a vehicle in an accident, not what that vehicle can do to another vehicle in an accident. \n\n\nMeanwhile if people were honest about what they needed, over what they wanted, the average car driven in the US would look something like a motorcycle, a scooter, a Geo Metro or a fifth generation Honda Civic.",

Sure, typical VW stupidity (lights burn out regularly, electronic gremlins) but overall a solid car, if regularly maintained ... but I only paid $7800 for it in 2019, before pandemic supply line fiasco ... so if i wanted the same car in 2022, i'd be paying over $10,000.

I take my daughter to and from daycare (22 mile round trip) and charge when I get home so I have a full battery when I pick her up. When the car is driving in \"hybrid mode\" and using gas it's about 42mpg and it has a 7 gallon tank. I try not to get caught without enough charge to go places but if I have to drop off my daughter then immediately after make a trip for work I'm going to be using gas that day. So \"1000 miles per tank\" isn't 100% truthful I suppose.\n\nI'd still 100% recommend a plugin hybrid if your situation allows you to change on a regular basis but just set your expectations before you buy. If I were going to take that Clarity on that same trip to Myrtle Beach I'd have to top for fuel once, and get to the hotel with probably half a tank. It does about 300-400 miles per tank depending on battery charge and all kinds of other factors.",

High enough gas prices add up fairly quickly, and disproportionately affect the working class since gas cars are often the only affordable option. Those with more money aren't impacted by gas prices as much, or can more easily seek alternatives like moving closer to work or getting an electric car.\n\nThat said it's generally a good idea to try and get a more economical gas powered car than some jumbo SUV that gets 16mpg like this girl.",

When the prices squeeze your budget, you look for ways on economising on fuel usage.  \nSure, everyone would like to be paying less, but quite often you have idiots who have enormous engine capacities who are then stumped as to why their fuel consumption is astronomical. Meanwhile, you have European cars which are designed around fuel economy which get substancially better mileage. For example, a friend of mine has a Dacia Logan, which gets about 55 MPG on the 0.9 litre engine. Is it a flashy car? no, but it can twice as far on the same amount of fuel as its average American counterpart.",

She's using a $70 gas bill for shock value, even though she'd still be paying $60 even if gas was $0.50 cheaper. Meaning that her high bill has hell of a lot more to do with the size of her tank rather than gas prices, which is what half of this guy's video is about.\n\nThe other half of the video is about how paying $70 for 24 gallons of gas wouldn't even be all that outrageous if her vehicle was more efficient.  \n\n\nEDIT: Her video is analogous to complaining about a huge check at an expensive restaurant and blaming it on outrageous dining expenses, even though you ordered 6 drinks and two 16oz steak sirloins with appetizers and a desert.",

If you drive 12,000 miles annually and your economy is 15MPG, you use 800 gallons of gas annually.  If your economy is 30MPG, you use 400 gallons of gas.  Gas prices are what they are in both cases but one vehicle will cost half the price of the other annually in this case (give or take depending on the price per gallon when either vehicle fills up).  That comparison matters.  But yes, the other side of the coin is that both vehicles will see an increase in their annual fuel expense as fuel prices increase.  That comparison also matters, but it's a different type of comparison.  You can't just discount the impact of fuel economy on one's monthly or annual budget.  The vehicle with better fuel economy is *still* paying less over a given period for traveling the same number of miles.\n\nLady in the video might just need an SUV but she needs to own up to the fact that it is going to cost her more to fill up than a sedan on an annual basis regardless of the gas prices.  If she wants to blame it on Biden, whatever.  She's still paying out the ass either way.",

At 10 gallons a week I barely notice any increase short of X2. people using more gas per week experience a greater $ loss from smaller percentage changes.\n\nin any event, oil companies continue to make massive profits and receive government subsidies. it's dishonest to pin the problems with gas prices on the president.",

But overall we rely heavily on imported oil. You can check on that year by year. \n\nDo not ask me why that's the way it is. You find out. You let me know.

What an easy win that would be. \n\nBiden, to folks ACTUALLY on the political left, is a corporate Dem. Disingenuous on energy.

I never said the administration was a few months old nor did the video. \n\nWhat I did say was that a president has no ability to greatly affect gas prices, *especially* within the first few months of their administration. Meaning that a president has so little affect on gas prices that even if they do pass some changes within the first few months of their administration, you're not at all likely to see a very noticeable change.   \n\nIn fact, I was being generous since there's so little a president can actually do in direct response to the price of gasoline. It's often his economic and international policies that can indirectly influence prices by putting a strain on or providing relief for those who consume fuel. Those influences can easily take up to a year to have an effect if they do at all. When the price of gas dropped 10% last year, it was because Biden partnered up with several other countries to release their reserves.  \n\nSo, if you were calling me out for suggesting a president can change the price of gas within a year, I'd tend to agree with you.   \n\nI'm certainly not worked into a rage at all.

In 2019 it reached $2.94. In 2018 it reached $2.97. So Jan 2021 was well below many other months under Trump. \n\nIn fact, if they want to credit Joe Biden for January 2021 gas prices, that month ($2.42) had the second lowest average retail gas price of any January in Trump\u2019s term ($2.46, $2.67, $2.34 and $2.63 for 2017-2020).\n\nFurther, in January 2022 when prices had risen to $3.41\u2026 they are basically identical to January 2012, 2013, 2014.

When the oil prices are high it incentivizes US production as the costs can be covered by high crude prices, when oil prices are low it costs too much to source it in the US.  It's a cat and mouse game with the Saudis and the president.  Because Biden is more focused on clean energy and reducing oil OPEC can raise prices by lowering output because they don't have to worry about US production coming online with a democrat president.",

It's even less than how much it went up EVERY week in January prior to Biden even taking office.\n\nThe oil rules time period show an initial decrease in price too. By your logic, it sounds like the news was taken very well.\n\nSo far the only point you've actually managed to make is that oil prices are essentially made up on the spot based on whatever the oil companies feel like at the moment and that the media has more impact than the president could ever hope for.",

I have been in charge of a lot of regulatory matters logging flare emissions, spills, using infrared camera to check for gas leaks, equipment maintenance, and all the general well operations including work on separators, flares, tanks, pipeline, and standard ESP units. \n\nA lot of our HSE (health, safety, environment) is run by government policy. Policies we have to protect the workers and environment don't exist in foreign countries. I know in Saudi Arabia where many of my friends have done work for halliburton, just vent their gasses into the atmosphere. Here we are required to capture via pipeline for use a large percentage of the natural gasses produced in oil exploration. What we don't capture, we flare. Legally we are only allow d to flare X amount of days per year, and a lot of paperwork goes into capturing how much and when we are flaring.\n\nOil production here is much better for the environment. When the president uses the EPA to pass policy that isn't voted on, it is a government mandate. Like when Joe Biden got into office and mandates no more new drills or gracing on federal land, which is a substantial portion of old and new well prospects. Things like shutting down the keystone pipeline, and others, also are a major factor in oil price.\n\nJoe Biden announced he was asking OPEC and Russia to boost production, evening lifting sanctions on Russias pipeline. Asking our defacto adversaries to increase production to lower prices for us is asinine. We are buying enough oil from Russia to fund any wars they might or might not be deciding to get into.\n\nWhy is it okay for other countries to produce oil in a way that is far worse for the environment than when we do it? Why does Russia get their pipeline but Canada doesn't? The hypocrisy of the situation drives me crazy. Saying the president doesn't control gas prices is true, but he does heavily influence how much production is possible.",

Compare that to a 1995 sentra with 37mpg highway and curb weight of 2300lb.  \n\nI think it just generally comes down to what the market (us) wants.  Car companies can do their best to analyze people's priorities and if people would prefer a wider body vehicle at the cost of ~3mpg, then that's what will sell.  If those smart-car type vehicles were driving high volume sales, then more manufacturers would make a similar vehicle that sacrifices cabin space for higher mpg.  \n\nSame can be said for HP.  People would prefer their vehicle can safely accelerate onto the highway or up a large hill rather than getting some additional mpg, so the engines are designed to be say ~150hp.\n\nTl;Dr capitalism",

Long term planning is a great thing.  We don't need the pipeline, we need to invest in getting off of our oil dependency. So, every generation to date is responsible for current prices because no matter how much you pump, there's only so much that exists and we have known this for a very long time. \n\n\nThe time is now to greatly reduce the oil dependency we have.

I barely drive anymore but where I live it's convenient. 40 minutes north of me if you didn't have a car you'd be screwed. All depends on location.\n\nPublic transportation is terrible though and frowned upon for certain instances. It's just also not convenient like it is in Europe and many places. I traveled all throughout Europe on trains and busses and whatnot it was amazing. Where I live  now if I wanted to go to the closest small city it's either an 8 minute drive, or walk a mile to train which has to go all the way south then switch trains west for almost 2 hours. Or take a 58 minute bus. It's absurd.\n\nBut if you love anywhere rural you're driving at least 30 minutes to do pretty much anything.",

But we also had seven different definitions of a \u201cgallon\u201d based upon its use. \n\nWhen we all realised that this was silly, in 1824, Britain chose a single \u201cimperial\u201d term and lumped together all gallon measurements, picking a roughly-average volume and calling it a gallon. That is today\u2019s \u201cimperial gallon\u201d.\n\nAmerican colonists, now an independent nation, stuck to tradition and kept just the Queen Anne's volume for their own gallon definition and expanded it for all uses.\n\nThe US Gallon is used in the US, Peru, Belize, Columbia, Guatemala, Haiti, Liberia, and Myanmar. It is used for petrol, while usage for other goods varies between the gallon and the metric system. \n\nThe vast majority of the world just uses the metric system for everything and look at us both as a bunch of goofs. \n\nUS Gallon = Queen Anne Old English Wine Gallon = 231 cubic inches unchanged since 1706\n\nImperial Gallon = a new Imperial measure invented in 1824 and not chosen to be used by the newly free nation of USA who had just finished (another) war with the British empire in 1815.",

Don't get me wrong, obviously the president has very little to do with gas prices, and anybody standing at the pump saying \"thanks Biden!\" is an idiot, but the rest of what you said is pretty off-the-mark.\n\n[Reasonable] people aren't pissed about gas being mid/high-$2s (still higher than the early-pandemic high-$1s prices you've referenced). They're pissed about it suddenly jumping from mid-$2s to mid-$3s. Where I live, gas went from something like $3.20 to $3.60 in one swoop sometime last week. That's motherfucking bananas. \"Inflation!\" isn't a catch-all excuse for any price increases. Some of it is straight-up price-gouging, and it's bullshit.\n\nTo go further, we don't particularly have sidewalks or bike lanes. We barely have buses. We certainly don't have a fucking train. And it's easy to be unsympathetic to, say, the soccer mom in a bronco, but what about the guy who's actually using his truck for work?\n\nMy point is, Americans' relationship with gas and gas prices is complicated, and bagging on people who think Biden made the price go up doesn't mean it's okay to bag on everyone who's *upset* that the price went up.",

Car prices are through the roof and EV credits are over and done with, so we drive what we already drive.\n\nWhen gas goes from $2.40 to $3.40 avg. year-over-year, it fucking hurts, and there's nothing John Q.

I am lucky enough to live close to work now to be able to walk, but we have zero public transportation. And a train?? The only trains we have are coal trains that run back and forth through town, sadly. This is the majority of my state, too. The bigger cities have better public transportation but still no trains, just buses. All of that is an issue in and of itself, but just keep in mind not everyone has the luxury of public transportation, sadly.",

If they had to actually insert $0.50 a mile into the dash to get somewhere, they'd all of the sudden discover that it's a waste of $2 to go to the store that's 2 miles down the rode for a slurpie.\n\nIf the government really wanted to improve the situation they could make some of that cost up front and preferably in cash to make the magnitude of the poor choice obvious to everyone.  But they won't because they prefer milking the morons for money via gas taxes and vehicle fees too.  God forbid, people might stop driving to the store to buy random shit they don't need every time they are bored and the economy would crash.",

Realistically, the price increase is due to pandemic era supply chain shortages, worker resignation and staffing difficulty, and policy changes that were set long ago that are only now going into effect.

Unless we're talking about astronomical differences in price, the total money you'd be spending more a year is pretty negligible, all things considered. I think people often mask travel costs as a whole as gripes about minor increases in gas prices.\n\nI understand it affects businesses or people with really large vehicles, but, for most people, this just doesn't apply. Let's say you have a 16-gallon tank, which would be on the high side. Let's say gas costs 2.50 for an entire year. Let's say you fill up every week. 16 gallons * 52 weeks * 2.50 = $2,080 a year.\n\nLet's say the next year gas goes up by .50. That'd be a pretty significant bump, at least in the US. Your cost? $2,496, which makes for a difference of $416.\n\nMaybe I'm spoiled, but that doesn't really sound like something to go crazy over. It's some money. Is it breaking your life? I guess that all depends on who you are, but, if you're spending so much gas the assumption is you're working quite a bit, and that really wouldn't be too consequential to your life. Sure, you'd love to have that money for other stuff. It's just...idk.\n\nI probably haven't made my argument well, but I just never understand people who complain about this stuff. It's usually not .50 and instead, it fluctuates across .20, which means you're really talking about ~$200. You'd love to have it. I get that, but in the face of your entire budget for the year?",

Because he is a complete and utter fucking moron, at the start of the pandemic when oil prices plummeted (because of the reason you said), and his stupid ass thought the stock market and him getting re-elected was more important than long term thinking went to OPEC and told them to cut production (he also tied an arms deal to it if I remember right). So, OPEC, and eventually the rest of the oil companies, massively cut their production. We still are about 5 million or so barrels a day short where we were worldwide pre-cut. \n\nGas prices aren't high because of Joe Biden, gas prices are high because Trump is an idiot, and oil companies love profits. I know, big surprise.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/13/opec-cut-is-trumps-biggest-and-most-complex-deal-ever-dan-yergin.html\n\nhttps://ycharts.com/indicators/world_crude_oil_production",

Because I know a hand full of senators where told how bad the illness would get before the WHO declared it a pandemic cashed out stocks in sectors that would be affected by lockdowns avoiding huge losses that the public had to endure. And I also understand why trump would undermine the WHO because he wanted them to look unreliable and Americans to keep acting as if, even though cases of Covid-19 where increasing. I love how Trump and the Republicans took all the glory for low fuel prices but in reality not many people who would commute to work where still working from home and producers of gasoline had no place to even store extra gasoline that has a shelf life of about six months if it\u2019s not stabilized with chemicals. The US isn\u2019t even part of OPEC, we have no control over most of the companies that produce gasoline. So yeah when people don\u2019t understand why fuel prices are higher and make everything else cost more are not reading between the lines for most of these people all they need is a meme on a social media platform for them to find someone to blame. Meanwhile Biden has released more gasoline from our national reserves just to pad rising prices.",

It was *barely* below $3 before the pandemic and then the price sunk because of a price war between Russia and SA i.e. the real players in deciding global prices (ever heard of OPEC)?\n\nDid you also miss the part that asked which policy is responsible for that? Prices have been rising since Trump was still in office. But y\u2019all weren\u2019t paying attention then were you because it wasn\u2019t convenient? Just like how y\u2019all ignore all those tax cuts, rate cuts, trade wars, and QE that happened under Trumps time in office.\n\nSo yea, right-wingers are still ignorant fucks. And the capacity is relevant because we aren\u2019t going to sympathize with someone who chooses the most costly and inefficient vehicles. If your car gets worse mileage and needs more fuel then of course gas prices are going to affect you more. I\u2019ve hardly noticed any difference to how much I pay at the pump with my sedan.

So that caused oil companies to slow production. When people started driving more it caused a spike in demand with a lower supply causing prices to rise. I have tried to explain to them that it is a simple supply and demand issue and basic economics 101. Do they listen? Nope. Not even a little. They genuinely get pissed off just for the simple fact they like Trump and hate Biden and just want to blame someone. Someone that has no control over a private company whose prices are determined by market demand and supply. They actually have gotten so pissed that they stopped talking to me for a couple days or just say they \"don't wanna talk about it\". So now, when they bring up politics talking about Trump and/or Biden I tell them I don't wanna talk about it. Thankfully they respect that at least. Its damn near impossible to talk reason to ignorance when its mind is set apparently",

With the addition they would be able to sell globaly. Honestly though, I\u2019ve recently learned that, that wouldn\u2019t matter simply because of OPEC.

However if it were reverted to costal refineries, there would be a decrease there, as well as a potential to sell to other countries. Almost seems like under the current system we\u2019re taking advantage of Canada being unable to transport its oil across the world without going through the US first. Wouldn\u2019t it be neighborly to build a pipe and let Canada flourish?",

It goes to our refineries in Ohio (which already buy up a surplus), and to ports in Texas for exporting to other countries, not the US.\n\nThe project was for a small extension/shortcut up north in the central states, that would\u2019ve reduced costs for the company in the long run, but wouldn\u2019t have effected quantities produced (and so, global market prices). \n\nThis was all made very clear when the project was presented to Congress. \n\nThe right was upset about its cancellation because of *jobs*- first of all, which there are too many right now anyway, leaving entire industries like food and service in the dust because everyone\u2019s getting better jobs (economy can\u2019t sustain like that forever), and second of all, it was a quick construction project. The company said it literally would only take 65 jobs to maintain it indefinitely after it was built. So it wouldn\u2019t have had the effect the right cries about anyway. \n\nIt was literally just a big Canadian Corp lobbying the right for the opportunity to make a little money for itself at the expense of American farm land (the existing keystone pipeline already has a terrible track record for enormous spills, so much more than what would happen if a truck or train wrecked- and being tar sands, several times worse and more expensive to clean up.)\n\nAnd also, companies are still getting permits for fracking and drilling so idk what that\u2019s about. Yeah, he prevented it in some designated protected wilderness areas. Not in the whole damn country. They can still get new oil. And they are.\n\nTrump literally went to Saudi Arabia personally, and threatened to end our partnership with them if they didn\u2019t reduce production. He said it was because the lower global prices were hurting the US economy, and Saudi Arabia was to blame. Gas was too cheap for the American consumer, to frump. So they did, they cut production then global and US prices went up (because they\u2019re all linked). \n\nSince he\u2019s gone, Saudi Arabia fired up production again (they shut down a big sector, it was expensive af to restart, but it\u2019s gonna be cheaper again eventually  so they\u2019re doing it) and oil prices have been stabilizing ever since. It\u2019ll take a while for it to finally be seen at the pump again. Trump costed the world a fuck ton of money with that one extra additional \u201cbest trade deal in the history of all trade deals\u201d.",

The misconception that older \"adult\" drivers are safer is simply due to *most* (but not all) 18 year olds already having 2 years of driving experience. In reality, 18 year olds that are new to driving still fuck shit up just as bad as 16 year olds that are new to it.",

You have a business where you build trucks, you go and find people that you convince to invest in your business which allows you to make more trucks and streamline production, your products become better and cheaper through investment money that you use to expand and improve, also you get a profit for the investors who then reinvest and others invest. Then one day the government says the way you build your trucks is bad and you must do the new way, your infrastructure needs to be completely reworked for the new system meaning you need more money and more investors but no one is investing in trucks like you build so you have to get money from the customer instead.\n\nIt\u2019s basic logic if you think about it and don\u2019t just absorb propaganda.",

The entire oil industry is being purposely gutted by Biden\u2019s policies for greener energy so all businesses in it have to overhaul their entire process.\n\nIn your neighbourhood analogy i\u2019m still right, a neighbourhood with less infrastructure is worthless than one with better infrastructure. People aren\u2019t going to invest in a street with half the profits if there is one with better profits because the government said on the first street you can only build half as much. How can you not grasp basic economics and investment?\n\nI have explained, cancelling the pipeline specifically increases prices of gas to the customer because it is one major part of a wilful effort to reduce gas use, making the industry less profitable, driving cost to the consumer up. You know you could just say \u201ci don\u2019t understand economics, business, investment or how government policy affects the economy\u201d would have been easier to and made more sense than what you have said.\n\nAmerica relies on external oil to survive due to cuts to the sector in general and policies enacted by Biden\u2019s administration. The ability for oil companies to export their products for profit affects their cost margins for how they sell back home (electronics in china and japan are dirt cheap but expensive elsewhere, get it dumb fuck?). Prices are up globally, in America they\u2019re up more than anywhere else in certain states due to Biden\u2019s anti oil policies and often democrat governors policies exacerbating the issue. Also, no, the keystone pipeline was not just for transporting oil from canada overseas, it was foe collecting and distributing crude oil to states with refineries to produce the gas we need. Funnily enough a big pipeline that makes transportation of oil really cheap will also reduce production costs and therefore cost to the consumer. Christ get a grip on reality dude.\n\nIt\u2019s so funny watching you struggle to understand something whilst acting superior like you have greater knowledge, you\u2019re just ignorant dude, clearly based on your ability to understand the variables in this discussion and your complete misunderstanding of how businesses are affected by government policy.",

They\u2019re fully accessible and profitable.\n\nOn top of that, we have a huge amount of oil to export.  The 74 lines continue to produce just as they have for decades.\n\nAlso, the US is one of the top producers of crude oil on the planet, and gas *is* significantly cheaper here than places that don\u2019t produce.  Europe, for example, where fuel is easily 2x the cost.  You\u2019re just making shit up.  \n\nPrices rose across the globe before the XL pipeline even existed, and it was not completed, so including it in the prices rising makes no sense.

If it wasn\u2019t then one pipeline wouldn\u2019t be a big deal at all\u2026so they wouldn\u2019t do just one. The point of the KEYSTONE pipeline is in the name, it\u2019s a keystone for future use and development as well as a hub. Tell me you don\u2019t know shit without saying you don\u2019t know shit.\n\nIf you can only build bungalows and the area where actual detached houses that make profit can be built is off limits, yeah it\u2019s unprofitable compared to other streets. Even in your own analogy you\u2019re a moron.\n\nPipelines don\u2019t produce oil dumbass, they transport it. How much and where they transport is relevant, not just the amount of pipelines. Are you actually this narrow minded or are you being purposely dumb? You realise population growth, use of oil and gas has increased for many consumers, more cars, more people, more homes, more heating. \u201cThe pipeline pumps the same as it always has blah blah\u201d yeah and that\u2019s not enough anymore dipshit. Why do you think they were building a new pipeline if we already have all we need? Why does america import oil if you have all you need. Are you actually this brain dead?\n\nOne of, still imports huge amounts, still starts wars to get it cheaper from elsewhere. The pipeline you keep saying is irrelevant is one thing that would help the industry. You are so dumb you argue the pipeline is pointless then praise Americas oil production when the cancellation of the pipeline damages the American oil industries, INCREASING COSTS. How are you this twisted, can you not use basic logic? \n\n\u201cGas is cheaper here than Europe\u201d that\u2019s always been the case. The point is that Americans gas prices are skyrocketing NOW due to democrat policies and Biden executive orders and policies/intentions. Just because they are and have always been cheaper than europe doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t going up. Your argument is like me saying \u201cchocolate in gumgum land used to be worth 10 and now its worth 100, still cheaper than gomgom land where it\u2019s 110\u201d even though it was always 100 and has only gone up by 10 whereas yours has gone up by 90. Hopefully explaining these things to you like you\u2019re a child is helping you.\n\nFuck you\u2019re dumb\n\nSaw your edit so i\u2019ll add my own. Congrats, you\u2019re an idiot once more who doesn\u2019t understand how investment or potential profit works. Biden\u2019s policies, intentions and the potential for him to be president all affect the market, all of that occurred before and during the pipeline. The pipeline would have helped the industry as a whole, reducing costs, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS BEING BUILT. Your outlook is so narrow that i\u2019m surprised you are even attempting to argue with me, are you not aware of how lacking in information you are or something? How do you not understand the potential and intended profits that keystone had that were destroyed? \n\nTime for another analogy for your child mind. If i tell you to give me 1000 dollars to buy a car that i will use for my job and pay you back plus more, then i have my license to drive revoked, obviously your profit and investment just got ruined. So if i come back and go \u201cok but this time they won\u2019t take my license away\u201d are you gunna invest? Also, the fact that you can\u2019t understand that just because an issue already exists doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be avoidably exacerbated by poor policies and the cancellation of projects that would ease the issue, is asinine, which is what Biden\u2019s entire energy platform is about. \n\nUse your brain dude",

Do you not realize how profitable the oil companies are currently?  TC energy (the owner of the keystone line) is not hurting, and again, they don\u2019t even have the XL.  Look up their stats.  \n\nBungalows and detached homes, I\u2019m sure!

You\u2019re already contradicting yourself too - people are moving to electric vehicles which alleviates some growth stresses the oil production may incur\n\nAlso, during covid nobody drove.  Demand was way down, so prices were too.  Once demand came back like a switch, prices went right up.  Remember the basic economics you mentioned?  Funny that the most obvious example of it somehow escapes you folks.\n\nFurthermore, prices started going up before Biden was even in office, so it\u2019s an extra layer of folly to put the blame on him (or any president for that matter).",

I'm going to piggyback some additional knowledge onto your comment, into this (otherwise) shitstorm of fucking brainless propaganda...\n\nWhile it's true that Biden doesn't directly 'control' prices, his (& largely Democrat, et al) political policies, ideologies, and words definitely can't be understated.  It VERY much drives sentiment and investment.  The pricing slump of '20 was absolutely devastating to production / tool / associated companies.  Not just due to lack of demand, but a supply glut previously unparalleled, largely thanks to a [Russia / Saud & UAE pricing war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Russia%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_oil_price_war#Events).  Not just resulting in a massive production cut, but I've seen numbers in the 270's estimating bankruptcies in the sector during '20/'21.  When you pile on political policies pushing for 'green' this & that, ICE cars to cease production (thanks to government penalties) across multiple major auto manufacturers, record investments into EV auto's, the investment money and willingness to re-enter that market dry up pretty quick from all but the most die hard or brave.  You've also got to remember, a LOT of those investors are actual boomers, probably well past retirement age at this point, or at least looking for that final exit.  Hell, even I'm reluctant (middle aged) to put much of my portfolio in any related companies.  A lot of this is anecdotal from first hand experience, but while there is a slow rise in activity, the 'rubber banding' in production that generally coincides with decreasing supply & rising prices seems much slower and way more muted than previous 'comeback's'.  Tag on ~15% inflation, slowly increasing demand, an international incident (oil down 4% today just on overnight news)... and it doesn't take a genius.\n\nI mean, \"yay team green!\" & what not...  but it's gonna hurt if you're still pumping gas.  It's gonna hurt bad.\n\n(edit - downvotes & no rebuttal - classic Reddit screaming with fingers in ears - I'd truthfully be surprised otherwise lol)",

One dollar means millions or beven billions of dollars lost per company and when it drops below a certain threshold it goes parabolic as the cost to operate exceeds profit.

All of these things cause gas prices to increase. Also, Biden himself said in 2019 \"I guarantee you. I guarantee you- were going to end fossil fuels.\n\nSo, please tell me how Biden hasn't contributed to the increase in gas prices. Also, how does it work-to you?",

It\u2019s a pipeline that was never thought to be 100 percent guaranteed. Yet from its approval to removal to approval to removal, gas has been low high low and high. \n\nFYI that pipeline was going to be insanely bad, research shows it\u2019s plans cut costs, outsourced jobs that have already been sent to other pipeline projects, it would have leaked heavily, displaced native Americans,\n\nHell, when the farmers of the US are telling you don\u2019t build it,\n\nMaybe we should listen.",

This may sound ignorant, but don't people put that into consideration when buying a car, how much fuel it'll likely gobble up. I mean it's the same as insurance, both of those things should be factors when buying a car. \n\nfurthermore, if a change of $5 a fill up is a make or brake deal for you, then you really need to reevaluate you're finances. I mean, that logic then means that you couldn't afford a repair on the car if it brakes or to perform proper maintenance/upkeep. \n\nAgain everyone's situation is different and during COVID, shits gotten rough for some .... but mainly these points are for those looking at being a new car or their first car ... really take into consideration these factors.",

          "text": "While I get where you\u2019re coming from on this point, you\u2019re underplaying the actual data. To fill up a tank didn\u2019t go up $5 it went up by just short of double. Gas used to be in the low $2 per gallon range (at least where I live) and more recently it was as high as the high $3 range. For example, I used to be able to fill up my tank for just over $20 but now it costs around $35 dollars. Now, $10-$15 still isn\u2019t that much but the ramifications of that for the entire economy are extremely dangerous. Let\u2019s say I fill up twice per week which is pretty standard for anyone with even a moderate commute. That\u2019s a $20 per week increase in costs on the low end which turns into $80 per month. Over the course of a year? That\u2019s almost a thousand dollars in yearly expenses. And that\u2019s just the gas. Now that gas has gone up so much, it\u2019s gonna cost twice as much to ship necessities to grocery stores. Those grocery stores are gonna have to pay higher wages in order to compensate for higher prices to keep workers around. And who\u2019s pocket do you think those higher costs are gonna come out of? The consumer. That\u2019s who. The CEOs and execs aren\u2019t gonna swallow the loss for the betterment of mankind. They\u2019re gonna raise the prices and continue to rake in millions. I\u2019ve seen this very thing happen where I work as a general manager of a fast food franchise. Every week costs of food supplies are increasing and the starting wage has raised to the point where I barely make more than new hires. Instead of taking the cut out of their bottom line they just raised the prices of every item on our menu by $.50-$1. It\u2019s a major ripple effect and when everything is affected by it the consequences are much more severe, aka an inflation rate of %7 as of Dec. 2021. How many American workers do you think got raises of higher than %7 to combat inflation? Very few. I hope I haven\u2019t sounded too harsh but so many people don\u2019t realize how everything is connected in a very precarious feedback loop. I hope this clears up some things. And to anyone who wants to say that President Biden had nothing to do with it, I\u2019m sorry but you\u2019re wrong. Yeah, he doesn\u2019t have direct control of the price but his policies have created several effects that have lead to the rise in gas prices including but not limited to: how the world perceives us and how we perceive ourselves. I\u2019m not saying I know anything about any particular policies that Biden has enacted but I do know that a large part of the US population and a large part of the world population view Biden as an old  forgetful man who probably needs help putting his pants on in the morning. This creates an environment where other governments feel like they can take advantage of us and where US citizens are losing faith in our government both of which have far reaching and cascading effects.",

Been that way ever since the days of Henry Ford when he realized he doesn't have a business without the oil companies because his cars depend on gasoline to run. I wouldn't be surprised if the automotive industry secretly owns most of the oil companies by now. \n\nThere are government mandates in place to implement all electric vehicles by a certain year too so I'm fairly certain this is the precursor to getting everyone to bust down the door at the dealership and buy an electric car. How do businesses and governments manipulate you? Prices. You set prices so high the squeeze is unbearable so everyone rushes out to buy an electric vehicle because they can't afford the high cost of gas anymore.\n\nMost people depend on their cars nowadays because that's the culture we've created for ourselves so they know you're at their mercy. They could set gas prices to $20 per gallon and what choice would you have but to pay? That's why gas prices keep going up with no end in sight.",

Yours is not a rational, reasonable, or logical argument.  So, no, the price hasn't actually doubled when corrected for statistical anomalies.\n\nWhile SUPERFICIALLY correct regarding the absolute numbers.

I get there is supple and demand, stock market reactions, possibly more taxes, etc. And I know it's not that easy, but just a curious question.\n\nWhat do you think, Reddit?",

This and also shutting down other oil pipelines in the United States causing additional transportation costs on gas and oil. I'm no genius, but energy independence, which caused prices to drop significantly thanks to a certain previous administration, and then becoming energy dependent from other countries amid an ongoing pandemic that had already seen shortages of some goods, doesn't seem like a good thing. But that is just my inference.\n\nNot to mention other economic disasters that cause more jobs to be shipped to other countries, furthering American dependence on other countries and thus inflating the American dollar.\n\nBut no, nothing Biden did within his first 10 days in office did anything to increase the price of gasoline and oil.",

Like the risk of a pandemic which can so dramatically affect demand that supply is scaled down, with later repercussions throughout the supply chain affecting the ability to bring that production back online now that we\u2019re starting to get through said pandemic and demand is up. And add in inflation, threat of war in Europe growing this year & now the realignment of contracts to work on supplying Europe with gas if the Russians cut off supply, and prices go up. Or you can work at explaining the current rise in prices on a pipeline a decade away from completion. People invest as a gamble on predicting what the future holds, and they are rewarded financially for supplying capital to the successful endeavor. Or they lose their bet, blame your current problems on their project failing to try to avoid accountability, & now hope people invest with them again.",

Americas plan was to become independent and Bidens plan was to go back to being a customer of oil and oil products instead of an exporter. \n\nNow you go back to buying OPEC Oil and you tell OPEC nations that you want to continue to be dependant on their oil. This means that there is less overall production and less suppliers in the market and it turns into a game of monopoly in which OPEC holds the cards. \n\nThis ripples out to everyone all around the world and fuel prices all around the world are at an all time high peaking after Bidens 1st year In contrast to Trumps time in which fuel prices went crazy low for the fist time in my life.",

I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re insistent on talking about world gas prices now because that\u2019s not what this was about. But yes canceling the keystone pipeline did also have a world affect because America now energy dependent and buying fuel from over seas which means that over seas prices will go up because of supply and demand. But the rising gas prices across the world aren\u2019t ONLY because of the keystone pipeline being canceled, it did have an effect on it but the current state of global economy and gas prices are due to whole bunch of bad policy\u2019s that have been set in place by the current administration as well as things that China is doing as well as countries shutting down manufacturing for a virus with a 99% survival rate. \n\nEverything is connected when it comes to global economy. But as for as this video goes my argument stands that yes Biden enacted an executive order shutting down a major pipeline on his first day of presidency and that instantly affected gas prices in America.",

It goes deeper then what\u2019s being produced and what is in the reserves. Plus the reserves are for emergencies such as war. The U.S. shale industry is in need of constant investment to keep oil production going up at the same time companies have to be more fiscally responsible than they were in the past because the Biden administration's clampdown is making it almost impossible to take economic risks in the industry. This leaves the US at mercy of OPEC and and Russia\u2019s production sharing agreements.",

          "text": ">Biden never agreed to the terms of the treaty with Iran that Trump abandoned.\n\nYou blame Biden for not doing something he could neither legally nor constitutionally do.  And, in concert with that, you think it's a quick process.  Hint, it's not.  JCPOA was signed only after 20 months of negotiations.  Even if Biden could do more than he already has (And, there have been significant strides made), it's been barely over a year.  Do the math.\n\n>If he had, more oil would be available.\n\nYou incorrectly assert that it would have somehow increased our oil supply.  No, it wouldn't have.  Iranian crude oil exports to the U.S. has regularly declined YoY since about 2004.\n\nExports continue to decline but not because of the lack of an agreement.  It's because of sanctions tRUmp implemented WITHOUT CAUSE OR REASON. (I've this machine feeling there's another country getting what little oil they do pump.)\n\n>Furthermore Biden never normalized relations with Venezuela.\n\nYou think normalization is achievable as a near-term deliverable? It's not, not the least of reasons being Venezuela is currently run by an illegitimate leader (Maduro) who is EXTREMELY anti-American as a matter of identity that he adopted from his mentor Ch\u00e1vez. So, yeah, that's a non-starter.\n\nHowever, Biden being Biden, not tRUmpian, **IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH m** and providing assistance to the legitimate Guaido Interim Government.  We have formal diplomatic relations with Venezuela via the recognized interim government. Biden has also nominated, and had confirmed, the first ambassador to Venezuela **in a decade**, Ambassador James Story.\n\n>If he had, that country would be on the way to exporting oil. Remember, Venezuela has more oil reserves than Saudi Arabia\n\nIt does not matter if their reserves are equal to all others combined.  When a country's election is overturned by an illegitimate tyrant who holds power, you're not gonna get it.\n\nBTW, You got one thing (barely) correct out of all that bullshit you've OBVIOUSLY been fed (Hmmm, I wonder from where?).  Venezuela's proven reserves, as of 2020, account for ~17.8% of world total oil reserves. \n\nSo, Yeah! \ud83e\udd73\n\nAlso, Saudi Arabia's proven reverses make up ~17.2% of the world's (1.73Tb) total reserves.  So, is pumping levels where equal, Venezuela's reserves wouldn't last all that much longer. Then there's the facts that S.A. has pumped a huge volume, for so much longer, so meh.  S.A. eclipses Venezuela for absolute reserves beginning to end.\n\nBut hey, Biden ain't doing nuthin' and he ain't doin' it right, m'right?  You said so, that must make it true.\n\nFail, you've clearly not paid any attention or even bothered to even briefly research what you're pissing and moaning about.  Turn off FauxNewz.  They lie and mislead to you as a matter of course.  They are not a news organization.  They are an entertainment company.  They've said exactly that in court fillings, and specifically about Fucker Carlson.\n\nHere's a tidbit:  You wanna glimpse at what life would be like had the January 6 Insurrection succeeded?  Look no further than Maduro, and that's what it could've been like. You got the illegitimate tyrant clinging to power through the subversion of democratic institutions, manipulation of elections, and force.\n\nThere I did your homework for you.  It doesn't require being an Einstein, just a little bit of effort and the application of critical thinking skills. You're welcome.",

And, look again at Venezuela reserves. Your figures are dead wrong.\n\nYou say Venezuela is an illegitimate government. Seriously? And Saudi Arabia is legitimate and gives more freedom and respects the human rights of its citizens??? You ever heard of the journalist named Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi? Let's talk about all those human rights Saudi Arabia granted him. And women in Saudi Arabia. Hey, it's a country full of feminists! \n\nWe shouldn't leave out how good SA has been to Yeman, the absolute poorest country in the Middle East. Yeman's military doesn't have a single plane (not one!) but somehow it's a threat to that wonderful country you admire so much; Saudi Arabia. Wow, about SA, you really got me there. \n\nVenezuela's government is illegitimate only because the US says so. Yes, I know the US twisted the arms of 40-some other governments to say the same. But, there are 195 countries in the world. That's more than 75%  that accept the Maduro government. Furthermore, do your research about Chavez. He brought more people out of poverty there than did any government since its inception. He didn't kowtow to the rich like the US does and for that reason he is hated by the USA  I'm not saying Venezuela is a government to admire but SA is more so?\n\nThe reason Venezuela is in terrible economic shape is because of the sanctions placed on it by the US. The US is directly responsible for most of the death and suffering that the Venezuelans experience. But hey, you probably think that won't matter because the US will keep out refugees fleeing that country so it's not our problem.\n\nWhat news do you read or watch???  Oh yeah, it's the middle class US based news that is completely unbiased. You have certainly spewed the US propaganda about SA and Venezuela.. Hey, at least V has elections. And yes, they are every bit as orderly as the upcoming 2022 US election will be, thanks to the illustrative reforms brought in by Trump's stooges. Try to listen to news from other countries. You might hear something different than the \ud83d\udca9 on which you base your writing \n\nYou so cleverly called out faux news. I agree it's an absolutely terrible news program. I just can't get over your cleverness using the word 'faux'.\n\nFrankly, Mr Einstein, the diatribe your critical thinking enabled you to spew smells like something from one of the Rhea sisters.",
