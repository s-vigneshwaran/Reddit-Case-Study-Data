  "text": "TIFU when I pulled a deaf woman over for speeding and asked to see her Vagina\nWell for starters this was several years ago when I was a young police officer in a college town in the South. I am retired now. \nTo set this up our department had been teaching us American Sign Language to help officers serve the public. I was all about learning sign language and picked some up pretty quickly, or so I thought. \nWell one night in the summer I am on traffic enforcement looking for drunk drivers and about 1am I stop a car for speeding. As approach the car a young and very pretty co-ed was driving. I start talking to her but she indicates that she is Deaf. Now I still had the ASL for police officers class from a week ago fresh in my mind and I think to myself \u201cgreat I get to use a new talent in the field\u201d. \nI indicate that I can sign and she smiles, so far so good! Now I need to add that I was nervous since this was the first time I had used this on the street and she was very pretty. \nI then sign that I needed to see her drivers license. A look of terror crossed her face and my cop radar went off.  I was thinking what have I stumbled upon. I had dealt with people that didn\u2019t have a license, were dangerous, were drunk, or had warrants. \nI again sign that I am a police officer and I needed to see her drivers license now and put my cop face on. I also remembered that to a deaf person the look on your face is equivalent to your tone of voice and apparently I was near screaming with my look. \nNow to add to this it is 1am, it is very dark on a side street and I am 6\u20192 230 lbs. and she is about 5\u20192 and maybe 100lbs. \nThis poor girl was FREAKED OUT! \nI finally realize I haven\u2019t stopped a serial killer and simply ask \u201cwell why?\u201d To which she looks down at her crotch and shakes her head violently NO. \nWell my little pea brain begins to gather information in and I realize that I had been lazy in signing the sign for drivers license and instead had been signing \u201c I am a police officer, show me your vagina!\u201d\nI still cringe at that and I must have lit up the road with the 1.1 gigawatts red face and the look of embarrassment/horror caught her off guard (well she was on guard 100% at that point) and she realized that I wasn\u2019t a rouge police officer using my authority to sexually assault her on a dark street, but just a cop that sucked at ASL. Well she started laughing at me and it had to be the relief she felt mixed the humor of what I did. It took several minutes to compose herself and I just stood there and took it looking  as sheepish as I ever have. I earned every second of her laughing. I just kept apologizing over and over (I\u2019m glad I got that one right at least)\nNeedless to say she DID NOT get a ticket but a story about this well meaning but dumb police officer that severely messed up a traffic stop. \nTL/DR: I pulled over a pretty deaf woman, asked in ASL to see her drivers license but mistakenly signed vagina instead of drivers license. Hilarity ensues.",

We had a girl in our class who was given the sentence \"My grandfather wants milk.\" The sign for milk is a mimic of milking a cow by squeezing the teat. She on the other hand made the fist but she jerked it up and down so instead of saying \"My grandfather wants milk\" she said \"My grandfather wants to jack off.\" I thought the teacher was going to die! She was a middle-aged woman and the look of horror on her face was priceless! All of us were laughing hysterically",

And the ideals of antiwork are actually awesome. Hell, anything that allows everyone to be able to live well, with health, happiness and a reasonable amount of downtime is good in my books. It\u2019s such a damn shame that this whole debacle has forever ruined the sub and its reputations as a whole. I do truly hope that workreform does a good job of continuing on its behalf",

As an interpreter, I was very used to being focused on by students. While interpreting at college level, I'd sometimes be in front of up to 400 people at a time, I got used to people \"knowing\" me and waving hi or talking to me like they knew me already. I never minded interpreting whatever was said, that was my job. And at the college level, believe me, I translated quite a few things I would have had to fingerspell in front of middleschoolers. :)\n\nNow, as to interpreting for a stand up comedian...whether or not that would be great or a PITA, depends on how much word play is in the routine. Idioms can be very difficult to express in sign language, and translating them word for word is rarely going to get the same effect. Signs are more concepts than word for word translations; as the English language has many similar meaning words, one sign is often used for many different words. Then you have some words that have many different meanings. Did you know that \"run\" has 43 different meanings?! There's run to your car, a home run, machines run, pantyhose run, milk runs...etc. So as you are interpreting, you are not just repeating back word for word what is said; you are signing the meaning of what is said. And if you are doing it in ASL, you are also changing the grammar of what is said. Some jokes rely on specific words, some rely on idioms, some rely on things that are heard (like songs most would know, or shared heard experiences). These would be very difficult to translate, like it would be difficult to translate strictly deaf jokes and idioms into spoken language. Unless you knew the material ahead of time, it would be very difficult to do a comedic routine justice, imo, and even then, it might not translate well.",

The officer almost definitely made the mistake of letting his index fingers and thumbs touch at the same time, creating the sign for vagina - which is pretty iconic. Just some advice to OP, maybe switch to signing ID which is just fingerspelled. Much easier because you can sign it with one hand and it will distance you from the ole vagina-license switcharoo",

The sign for vagina is usually signed near the groin just because it\u2019s an iconic sign, but you can also flip it upwards and sign it (technically upside down) in front of the face in order to show concepts like \u201ccunnilingus.\u201d The big reason why this confusion happened is because the sign for license doesn\u2019t really have much flexibility. You never really play around with it\u2019s orientation or anything so it is confusing to see it signed clumsily (no offense OP)",

It is one of the bigger/older podcasts out there, started before most people know what podcast is... They used to rank number one in the US. They are still top 20 or so.\n\nAt first it takes a while to get used to them. It sounded like two friends bantering and sharing what they researched. Apparently they don't go by scripts and don't even research together \u2014 they work on a topic independently and just come to talk about it. Occasionally they get things wrong but they are pretty chill about that and welcome criticism.",

There are whole genres of ASL poetry dedicated to using only a single handshape to talk a story, jokes which make fun of people twisting up one sign for another (just like this situation) and even some puns and euphemisms which blend signs in order to make a new one for the sake of the pun.

The highway was about to split about two miles and I needed to take the left exit but he turned his lights on before the split and I didn't want to go right or pull over on the side of IH10. Before the split was a 6 Kane highway in the middle of morning rush  So I put my blinkers on to show him I saw him and took the left split then exited the highway. He followed me for 5 minutes. It was about 730 in the morning and I was taking my daughter to school. Well the exit was super busy after I exited so I just kept going to the next street which was only 25 ft but it was secluded. Like nothing was down that street at all. So when I finally pull over, he walks up to the car and I immediately say  \"I'm sorry I didn't pull over sooner, it seemed too dangerous for you to stand on the side of my car in this traffic so I pulled to the safest spot!\"  so he didn't think I was trying to evade him. He thanked me for that and said he clocked me going 75 in a 55. I had my 11 year old in the car and he asked her if she knew what was going on. She said yes. He asked her if I deserved a ticket or a warning. She seemed super upset but understood that what I did was wrong and so she said \"She deserves a ticket\". I just laughed because she was just being honest. He thought it was funny too. He told her \"Yes she does but I think this time she will learn her lesson with a warning.\" I really didn't think I was gonna get off with a warning. And I still think about that from time to time.",

They have their own grammar, syntax, and linguistic history. Just like several attempts of making artificial \"universal\" spoken languages have failed, so to have attempts at making one sign language for everyone in the world. Just because ASL is used in America doesn't mean that it has very much similarity to English. It uses an entirely different sentence structure, uses very few articles, and doesn't inflect words for tense or number (to name a few). ASL is a descendant of French sign language; a French sign language teacher came to America and brought the French sign language with him and introduced it to deaf people (and especially school children) in America. They used his signs, but adapted them for their own needs, and so it evolved like any other language, and continues to to this day, just like any spoken language. Interestingly, though the spoken languages of America and England are very similar (the same in fact) American sign language and British sign language are very different from each other. \n\nAn interesting story that really shows that signed languages are real, organic, language is from Nicaragua. In the 1980s, Nicaragua didn't have a sign language, but started setting up schools for deaf kids. The teachers there tried to get the kids to lip read and speak Spanish, but lip reading is really hard in general, and learning to speak a language when you can't hear it being pronounced is also obviously difficult. So the kids weren't picking up Spanish at all. But, they started communicating with each other, as best they could with gestures and such, on the playground and that kind of thing, and as each new grade came into the school, they learned the crude signs that the students there had managed to agree on, without any kind of other communication. In about 6 years, the kids had managed to create an entire language with proper grammar, subject-verb agreement rules, and various other things. It's a fascinating story, and that language is the primary sign language used in Nicaragua today.",

One of my prof\u2019s would scrape her nails across a chalkboard (yes, it was one of the only rooms that actually had a chalkboard instead of a white board) and sign \u201cdoesn\u2019t bother me, I\u2019m Deaf. Don\u2019t talk.\u201d It really was a great way to learn. Kinda like someone going abroad and living with a host family. I will say tho that after class it was surreal going back out into the \u201chearing\u201d world after hours of silence. It took some getting used to after every class, every year. Another fact is that American Sign Language is based off French Sign Language. We learned it from them. I can understand FSL but British/English or Australian is completely foreign to me.",

They tried teaching us NZSL when I was in school but we only learned a few things; maybe I should pick it back up in future.",

I\u2019m jealous you get to live in such a progressive and beautiful place. With all the Covid masking I\u2019ve definitely helped some people have a few minutes of easier communication since they can\u2019t read lips through the masks.

      "text": "Holy wall of text, Batman!\n\n>Well for starters this was several years ago when I was a young police officer in a college town in the South. I am retired now. To set this up our department had been teaching us American Sign Language to help officers serve the public. I was all about learning sign language and picked some up pretty quickly, or so I thought.\n\n>Well one night in the summer I am on traffic enforcement looking for drunk drivers and about 1am I stop a car for speeding. As approach the car a young and very pretty co-ed was driving. I start talking to her but she indicates that she is Deaf. Now I still had the ASL for police officers class from a week ago fresh in my mind and I think to myself \u201cgreat I get to use a new talent in the field\u201d. I indicate that I can sign and she smiles, so far so good! \n\n>Now I need to add that I was nervous since this was the first time I had used this on the street and she was very pretty. I then sign that I needed to see her drivers license. A look of terror crossed her face and my cop radar went off. I was thinking what have I stumbled upon. I had dealt with people that didn\u2019t have a license, were dangerous, were drunk, or had warrants. I again sign that I am a police officer and I needed to see her drivers license now and put my cop face on. I also remembered that to a deaf person the look on your face is equivalent to your tone of voice and apparently I was near screaming with my look. \n\n>Now to add to this it is 1am, it is very dark on a side street and I am 6\u20192 230 lbs. and she is about 5\u20192 and maybe 100lbs. This poor girl was FREAKED OUT! I finally realize I haven\u2019t stopped a serial killer and simply ask \u201cwell why?\u201d To which she looks down at her crotch and shakes her head violently NO. \n\n>Well my little pea brain begins to gather information in and I realize that I had been lazy in signing the sign for drivers license and instead had been signing \u201c I am a police officer, show me your vagina!\u201d I still cringe at that and I must have lit up the road with the 1.1 gigawatts red face and the look of embarrassment/horror caught her off guard (well she was on guard 100% at that point) and she realized that I wasn\u2019t a rouge police officer using my authority to sexually assault her on a dark street, but just a cop that sucked at ASL. \n\n>Well she started laughing at me and it had to be the relief she felt mixed the humor of what I did. It took several minutes to compose herself and I just stood there and took it looking as sheepish as I ever have. I earned every second of her laughing. I just kept apologizing over and over (I\u2019m glad I got that one right at least) Needless to say she DID NOT get a ticket but a story about this well meaning but dumb police officer that severely messed up a traffic stop. \n\n>TL/DR: I pulled over a pretty deaf woman, asked in ASL to see her drivers license but mistakenly signed vagina instead of drivers license. Hilarity ensues.",

Firemen over there are voluntaries (tax benefits and whatnot, but voluntaries), and they have a regular life outside firefighting. There was a nasty fire, and this fireman didn't have access to an emergency vehicle because he was chilling at home and wasn't on duty. Things got real bad so he sped the whole way to the scene to help out, which was captured on speeding cameras. He got nasty tickets, which he tried to contest to high levels, and the bottom line is that authorities apologized, thanked his effort and expressed their empathy, but argued the facts: he was speeding in a civilian vehicle without a turret, and that's the end of it.\n\nThat's obviously the most Swiss thing ever, but it's a different mindset where rules are the basis of society, and absolutely no one is above them (in theory). Not saying it's the right way to go, but there's a different basis of trust where rules' context is irrelevant. Needless to say, people drive impeccably over there, possibly at the expense of some people who were unfairly punished like that fireman.",

      "text": "^^Fixed ^^the ^^paragraphs\n\nWell for starters this was several years ago when I was a young police officer in a college town in the South. I am retired now. \n\nTo set this up our department had been teaching us American Sign Language to help officers serve the public. I was all about learning sign language and picked some up pretty quickly, or so I thought. \nWell one night in the summer I am on traffic enforcement looking for drunk drivers and about 1am I stop a car for speeding. As approach the car a young and very pretty co-ed was driving. I start talking to her but she indicates that she is Deaf. Now I still had the ASL for police officers class from a week ago fresh in my mind and I think to myself \u201cgreat I get to use a new talent in the field\u201d. \n\nI indicate that I can sign and she smiles, so far so good! Now I need to add that I was nervous since this was the first time I had used this on the street and she was very pretty. \n\nI then sign that I needed to see her drivers license. A look of terror crossed her face and my cop radar went off.  I was thinking what have I stumbled upon. I had dealt with people that didn\u2019t have a license, were dangerous, were drunk, or had warrants. \n\nI again sign that I am a police officer and I needed to see her drivers license now and put my cop face on. I also remembered that to a deaf person the look on your face is equivalent to your tone of voice and apparently I was near screaming with my look. \n\nNow to add to this it is 1am, it is very dark on a side street and I am 6\u20192 230 lbs. and she is about 5\u20192 and maybe 100lbs. \nThis poor girl was FREAKED OUT! \nI finally realize I haven\u2019t stopped a serial killer and simply ask \u201cwell why?\u201d To which she looks down at her crotch and shakes her head violently NO. \n\nWell my little pea brain begins to gather information in and I realize that I had been lazy in signing the sign for drivers license and instead had been signing \u201c I am a police officer, show me your vagina!\u201d\nI still cringe at that and I must have lit up the road with the 1.1 gigawatts red face and the look of embarrassment/horror caught her off guard (well she was on guard 100% at that point) and she realized that I wasn\u2019t a rouge police officer using my authority to sexually assault her on a dark street, but just a cop that sucked at ASL. Well she started laughing at me and it had to be the relief she felt mixed the humor of what I did. It took several minutes to compose herself and I just stood there and took it looking  as sheepish as I ever have. I earned every second of her laughing. I just kept apologizing over and over (I\u2019m glad I got that one right at least)\n\nNeedless to say she DID NOT get a ticket but a story about this well meaning but dumb police officer that severely messed up a traffic stop. \n\nTL/DR: I pulled over a pretty deaf woman, asked in ASL to see her drivers license but mistakenly signed vagina instead of drivers license. Hilarity ensues.",

          "text": "For starters, this was several years ago when I was a young police officer in a college town in the South. I am retired now.\n\nTo set this up our department had been teaching us American Sign Language to help officers serve the public. I was all about learning sign language and picked some up pretty quickly, or so I thought. \n\nWell one night in the summer I am on traffic enforcement looking for drunk drivers and about 1am I stop a car for speeding. As approach the car a young and very pretty co-ed was driving. I start talking to her but she indicates that she is Deaf. Now I still had the ASL for police officers class from a week ago fresh in my mind and I think to myself \u201cgreat I get to use a new talent in the field\u201d. I indicate that I can sign and she smiles, so far so good! Now I need to add that I was nervous since this was the first time I had used this on the street and she was very pretty. \n\nI then sign that I needed to see her drivers license. A look of terror crossed her face and my cop radar went off. I was thinking what have I stumbled upon. I had dealt with people that didn\u2019t have a license, were dangerous, were drunk, or had warrants. I again sign that I am a police officer and I needed to see her drivers license now and put my cop face on. I also remembered that to a deaf person the look on your face is equivalent to your tone of voice and apparently I was near screaming with my look.\n\nNow to add to this it is 1am, it is very dark on a side street and I am 6\u20192 230 lbs. and she is about 5\u20192 and maybe 100lbs. \n\nThis poor girl was FREAKED OUT! I finally realize I haven\u2019t stopped a serial killer and simply ask \u201cwell why?\u201d To which she looks down at her crotch and shakes her head violently NO. Well my little pea brain begins to gather information in and I realize that I had been lazy in signing the sign for drivers license and instead had been signing \u201c I am a police officer, show me your vagina!\u201d \n\nI still cringe at that and I must have lit up the road with the 1.1 gigawatts red face and the look of embarrassment/horror caught her off guard (well she was on guard 100% at that point) and she realized that I wasn\u2019t a rouge police officer using my authority to sexually assault her on a dark street, but just a cop that sucked at ASL. \n\nWell she started laughing at me and it had to be the relief she felt mixed the humor of what I did. It took several minutes to compose herself and I just stood there and took it looking as sheepish as I ever have. I earned every second of her laughing. I just kept apologizing over and over (I\u2019m glad I got that one right at least) \n\nNeedless to say she DID NOT get a ticket but a story about this well meaning but dumb police officer that severely messed up a traffic stop. \n\nTL/DR: I pulled over a pretty deaf woman, asked in ASL to see her drivers license but mistakenly signed vagina instead of drivers license. Hilarity ensues.\n\nsorry if the formatting doesnt make much sense but id have to rewrite some stuff otherwise",

They are not remotely similar; if you have had to practice the sign more than once.... which you should, while in a learning setting. They shouldn't even teach \"vagina\" to any police officer.... you would NOT have made a mistake, if they had even brought up the sign for vagina, in a \"professional\" learning course. \n\nThe other option... she was not deaf... and got one over on you; realizing, that your sign sucked.

According to the story... she was appalled/freaked out (more than once), before the mistake was realized. This is because... it is NOT so easy a mistake, if you actually know/were taught, the sign for \"license\" (insert thumbs touching, and making a 'goal-post' looking sign, with index fingers pointing up)... \n\nOne points down, with the backs of your hands facing the person you are signing to, while pointing inward with all assigned fingers, to form a diamond... the other... shows the inside of your hands, while you point upward, and only touch thumbs the two index fingers, pointing straight up... practice at home based on description; or look it up.

She didn\u2019t respond so he asked again. This time she looked at him with a look of horror. He thought maybe she didn\u2019t hear him so he asked once again loud enough for several other students to hear. She became red in the face and the surrounding students laughed uproariously. It turns out the Xian pronunciation of pencil is very similar to the Beijing pronunciation of vagina.",
