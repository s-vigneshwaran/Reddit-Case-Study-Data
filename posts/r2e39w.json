Someone using the generic term of 'frying pans' wouldn't infringe the trademark, but if someone then started marketing 'El Rob's Super Frying Pans' and operates a similar business then that probably infringes. \n\nI'm not saying the laws are perfect, but they aren't terrible",

The blanket ownership is something that the creators should decide, and I believe all copyrights leases/agreements should have term limits on them. Essentially the lessee must renegotiate the contract after X years so that they don\u2019t own the rights indefinitely (eg. Sony and Spider-Man).",

Everywhere I've ever travelled to, whatever country, Mcdonalds has had espresso machines for the last 5-10 years. And they sell all the same sorts of drinks as Starbucks do, even frappachino type things. \n   \nI've heard anyway that Australia loves a LOT of coffee, as in huge quantities of it, but the actual quality of the coffee isn't really better than anywhere else. There's just way more of it. Like every coffee place tends to use the same over-roasted beans because people falsely believe that dark roast has more caffeine in it, when it doesn't. \n  \nSo there's a lot of good independent coffee shops that do order actual good beans, speciality beans, and grind them only right before use rather than grinding them and leaving them for weeks before eventually brewing. Like almost everywhere in the world, at least in the western world anyway, like if you go to London or New York or Berlin and go to great indie coffee places you'll find amazing stuff. But anywhere that's a chain, isn't gonna be outstanding or anything. Even the very best coffee chains never have great coffee. What they have is consistent coffee. Consistently over-roasted, and over-extracted. But it always tastes the same, wherever you go. There's never gonna be great baristas working in a fast food or coffee chain. They'll work at the actual good coffee places. \n    \nIt's the same sort of deal as the nordic countries. Apparently Finland drinks more coffee than anywhere else, but the actual quality of the coffee is usually terrible. It's just very hot and has a lot of caffeine, which is all that they care about",

Sure, as long as you\u2019re putting in enough work to stimulate the muscles.\n\nYou\u2019re probably going to gain more fat on a dirty bulk than on a clean bulk, so if you bulk from 80kg 15% BF to 90 kg, you would probably end up at around 18-19% BF on a clean bulk, but at 21+% on a dirty bulk. The dirty bulk would of course also be quicker.\n\n(Assuming a clean bulk means sticking to a caloric surplus of 200-500 kcal/day with enough protein and fat to grow, and a dirty bulk means eating a fuck ton of whatever, exceeding the required macros and caloric surplus)",

( An active lifestyle is one where you play a sport  or exercise more then once a week.) \n\nSo average American weight for a male is 178. Calories to maintain weight if you're a lazy bum is 2314, 2670 if you're semi active and 3026 if you're very active. I'm Six foot Five an 200ish lbs ( if you're trying to gain weight multiple by you're goal weight and eat that much) so my caloric intake is 3026 a day to maintain my weight ( I should be shooting for 3450 a day to get back to a health weight for my body type) \n\nSecond a Big Mac is only 650ish calories. For a burger is actually normal for the one of the big meals a day you should eat.\n\nA 20 piece nuggets more at 860 and either of those is fine calorie wise for an entree for a dinner or lunch meal which should be  about 1/3rd of your daily calories.\n\nShould be 1/4th of your daily calories for breakfast, a third for lunch, a third for dinner at the rest for Snacks.",

That's a huge hit for a single meal (especially if you follow the division you pointed out in your post.\n\nLike I said, though, a once in awhile treat or factoring in after lots of exercise makes sense\n\nedit: Fries, not friends.

I am 5'4\" and weigh 137 pounds. I am on a 1,200 calorie a day diet and sometimes hit 1,500 on my \"cheat\" day.\n\nI don't eat shit fast food, which helps a lot. If you pay attention to what you eat, you can have a healthy diet under 2,000 calories a day. I will stick to the advice from my MD and dietician instead of from a chef. I don't care if you've taken nutrition classes. You don't professionally keep up on nutrition and what people can and cannot eat.",

Was trying to point out no one should assume they just need 2000 calories a day unless they are exactly 153 lbs and 153 lbs is your health body weight for your height. If your 90 lbs you only need like 1200 calories. If your goal weight is around 100 then yeah 1200 to 1500 calories is spot on.\n\nEdit : Oh and for the record I DO professionally keep up on current scientific facts about nutritional health because it's part of my job. I have just as much training and post school education as any dietician i just haven't bothered to go take a licensing exam because I don't need one. If I get caught out by a guest not knowing the nutritional effects of my food i wouldn't be a very good chef. Any Executive Chef worth their salt keeps up to date not only on what foods are healthy for you or not but also what's being recalled by the FDA for various health reasons so we are probably better informed than your dietician is but way to be classist because you don't understand a careers function. If I get a celiacs disease guest and don't know what foods can trigger that and they informed us and then I gave them Gluten then that's my job on the line.",

Tried them and the food was really good. They had a section in their menu about the name, basically claiming it as Scottish meaning \"son of China\"\n\nYes, McDonald's had sued but that got tossed by a judge saying they were basically trying to trademark the prefix \"Mc\" without actually registering it. Ironically we had made the same association and AVOIDED the place for that reason but the courts said they can't just decide they own any name containing \"Mc\" or, presumably, \"Mac\"",

I'd say taco sauce is closer to mayonnaise with some Chilli and other spices. Although it has zero relation to actual tacos I'm pretty sure it started off as a sauce added to taco fries (aka chilli fries) and that's where it got it's name. Someone got the bright idea to start selling it in a bottle and since they had to name it something, named it taco sauce after the taco fries.",

Genitive case is applied where there's possession or similar association, e.g., Clann U\u00ed Cheallaigh - the family of \u00d3 Ceallaigh\n * **In\u00edon U\u00ed** Cheallaigh - the daughter of the grandson of Ceallach\n * **N\u00ed** Cheallaigh - a contraction of In\u00edon U\u00ed Cheallaigh\n * **Bean U\u00ed** Cheallaigh - wife of the grandson of Ceallach\n * **U\u00ed** Cheallaigh - a colloquial contraction implying Bean U\u00ed Cheallaigh\n\nGrandson isn't literal, and refers to descendents after a point. In Ireland we used literal patronymic names so that you were mac/in\u00edon of your father's or sometimes mother's name depending on the context. The introduction of retained patronymic names seems to have arrived around the turn of the millenium (1000AD) as the trend came to note powerful or notable ancestors. Particularly interesting examples would be the name O'Brien/\u00d3 Briain which is to declare descent from Brian B\u00f3roimhe (Brian Boru), a famous high King of Ireland who won at the Battle of Clontarf. \n\nIt's worth noting that these naming distinctions may seem odd or even sexist in current times. I don't believe this is the case as the role of women in old Gaelic culture was a strong position and these are simply descriptors for relationships within a clann. Retained patronymic names were a way of claiming descent from powerful figures.",

If McDonald\u2019s doesn\u2019t go after each food related business with \u201cMc\u201d in its name then the trademark will be invalided because it has become generic. And if that happens, everybody can open an McBurger / McGrill / McSeafood, McBBQ and so on. \nThis would ruin their business in two ways: People would no longer pay franchise fees and instead just open their own business closely imitating McDonald\u2019s restaurants.\nAnd if one of these restaurants would have bad food, bad customer service or would be involved in a scandal it would immediately damage the brand of McDonald\u2019s because the average joe would assume that they are part of the same corporation.\nThe brand value of McDonald\u2019s has been build up over decades and is worth billions of dollars so they can\u2019t afford to lose even if no one at these companies is happy to waste time and resources going after small businesses which only lead to bad PR and have no financial benefits.\nThis is also the reason why Adobe doesn\u2019t want anyone to use the verb photoshop, Google doesn\u2019t want anyone to use the term \u201clet me Google this\u201d and instead \u201cLet me use the Google search\u201d",

In other words, this is actually one of the rules that benefits everyone, because companies don't just have vaults of patents they can whip out and sue someone over, they need to actively use and defend the trademark in order to keep it. As you can see in this case, the rules do actually work to protect the smaller businesses. \n\nFor example, let's say you had a store that sold pool noodles, and your mascot was a guy who ran around with pool noodle arms and a pool noodle hat who acted like a fool and you called him \"Happy Noodle Boy\" or some shit. Now let's say WalMart starts using a noodle armed mascot named \"Enthused Noodle Lad\" to sell pool noodles. If they were allowed to sell the pool noodles using essentially your mascot, that could lead to your business getting taken out by the monolithic WalMart. Since this rule is in place, you can sue them over it. However, if you do not sue them over it and they become successful enough for people to associate a noodle appendages man with WalMart instead, they could apply for ownership of that idea. \n\nLet's reverse it and say that someone wanted to sell pool noodles and they saw Walmart's Enthused Noodle Lad, was absolutely delighted by it, and copied the idea. WalMart eventually figures out that no one really likes ENL so they stop using him, but they don't let go of the patent in case they want to revisit the idea. 15 years go by and the smaller business has grown and people now associate a noodle appendaged man with the business, not WalMart. It's a local business so WalMart never catches wind of this and they try bringing back ENL. Well now that second business has a right to claim ownership over that idea. This again protects the little guy. I mean hell, this article is proof that these rules work.",

But MacDonalds has obviously been selling BigMacs this whole time, so in appeal they fixed their evidence, and the ruling was scaled back considerably. \n\nIn the end, I think it lost the exclusive right to the 'Mc' suffix for it's products, but it kept the 'BigMac' trademark, plus a bunch of other specific ones.",

But the American workers at the Tennessee plant *refused* to unionize and gave the company the power to do whatever they wanted, leaving Volkswagen extremely confused.\n\nFrom an article by the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/11/19/the-strange-case-of-the-anti-union-union-at-volkswagens-plant-in-tennessee/):\n\n> VW\u2019s supervisory board had voted to establish the plant in Chattanooga back in 2008, and Stumpf remembers that the company took it as a matter of course that a works council would follow soon after. \u201cWe never realized that it would be a problem in the land of democracy,\u201d he said at a labor conference in Tennessee last week.\n\nSo US companies try to stir shit in the EU and get knocked down by the courts. EU companies try to do the right thing in the US but get knocked down by the local populace. I guess you just can't win?",

In the UK they do Oreo, Milkybar, and Malteser flavours. Unavailable in AU now.\n\n- Crispy Strips: chicken strips, no longer available at all (though they used to be at both AU and UK branches).\n\n- Regular Twister: it's a wrap. There's also the Zinger wrap which is basically a spicier version. Both the UK and AU have it.\n\nI don't know why I typed up this mini-guide but I guess I was surprised that the US never had these (and am also surprised that Australian KFC is so close to British KFC). I think UK and AU KFC must be way more similar than US vs Intl.\n\nedit: ok yeah they're definitely Australian, never thought to click their profile",
