Space loses itself, as no one is there to observe it or do anything with it. Abstract, empty, a void that might as well never have existed. Our individual lives make up the whole of humanity, and with our death we are able to dim the light and remove the entirely of the universe. If all humans fall, there will not be simple darkness left. There will be nihility. Each human uses this power when they are gone.

The only reason the world is free, is that the United States decided it would be better for the world to be free than dominated by empires.\n\nThe US was the primary reason that colonialism was ended following WW2. \n\nAnd stopping Putin from invading a free democratic country has nothing to do with the US \"rules the world\" dumbfuck.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nedit: little biitch Lrkilla_g replied to me then blocked so I couldn't reply back, so here is my reply:\n\n> Imagine actually thinking America can conquer the world when they can\u2019t even beat a bunch of rice farmers lmao\n\nAmerica did beat rice farmers, 100% of the time, many, many times, throughout the Vietnam war. \n\nAmerica could have also easily invaded North Vietnam and conquered it at any time. The NVA couldn't do shit against the US in a straight up fight. The sole reason we did not do so was to not \"escalate the war\" vis a vis the USSR and China.",
