  "text": "TIFU by using coconut oil to eat ass.\nThis FU occurs after a recent innovation in the bedroom.\n\nCoconut oil.\n\nIt\u2019s great! It\u2019s solid until it\u2019s on your skin and then it\u2019s a wonderful long lasting lubricant that tastes delicious, and is easy to clean up afterward.\n\nIt\u2019s been my go too with my partner for a few months now whenever I\u2019m down on that ass. \n\nWhat is the FU you ask? \n\nMe and my coconut oil loving partner decided on a Thai food double date.\n\nMy partner orders a bowl of coconut curry.  I get some fried rice.\n\nSee where this is going yet?\n\nShe offers me a bite of her curry, I accept.\n\nInstant Boner. The curry tastes just like I\u2019m going to town on her booty. Coconut oil heaven. \n\nSo there I am, rock hard, sitting at a table with our best friends. Doing my best to hide my extremely inappropriate physical reaction to an otherwise perfectly delicious but decidedly not sexy coconut curry.\n\nMy partner thinks this is wonderful.\n\n\ud83e\udd65\ud83c\udf46\n\n\nTLDR: Ive Pavlov\u2019d myself into getting a boner whenever I taste coconut.",

And by sexual preference I don't mean orientation, I mean specific things that lead to your orgasm. If you can only cum under a specific particular set of conditions it's because you're conditioned to it. This is sort of how fetishes begin to develop and the longer period of time your body is used to orgasiming under these conditions, the more they're reinforced and hard to break. This explains also why many men have no problem cumming from masturbation but have a hard time during intercourse (drunkenness and performance anxiety aside). The pressure, speed, and feeling associated with years of frequent and specific kind of masturbation is wholly different from what your brain is used to when it comes to sex.",

I told her I had done with tons of partners and she laughed and said it could cause all kinds of infections if used as such.\n\nI had no idea and felt like some hippie asshole.
