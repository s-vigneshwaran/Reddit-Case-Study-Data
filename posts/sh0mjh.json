Like take India (where I am from) as an example\n\nRecently, there was a case, where a woman in the pedestrian crossing, was walking when the lights had turned red, and a car almost crushed her, but the driver stopped the car on time, so, she still stays in front, abuses the guy, brings him out, and slaps him 22 times nonstop, and the Police officer standing there could do nothing... Even when it was all the girls fault... The driver was a poor man, he suffered a lot, no one helped him around... His phone was crushed by the girl, and he wasn't even repayed...\n\nEven with the CCTV footages, he was still arrested, even with live on scene proof videos... And the girl ? She goes on chanting feminism all over the media... Still till date the girl has not been arrested, though the guy got out after few days... He asked for repayment of his self respect which he lost that day, poor soul :(\n\nPolice can't do shit, in India, even police officers are helpless... Shit ! Even the most rich politicians and media journalists and judges of courts get falsely accused ! And no action taken, instead the guys are fired ! And girls are told \"you go brave girl \ud83d\udcaa\" I mean wtf...\n\nI will link the video here (where I saw it for the first time) : \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/IndianDankMemes/comments/ovkoc0/full_feminism/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share",
