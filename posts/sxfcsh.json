Now the more experience you get the more your charge increases+ the more popularity resulting in more clients(assuming you're doing a pretty good job). So let's assume you'll get to 30requests/week by the end of the year. Keep in mind that n(clients)< n(bj) because at least 30% of them will ask for another one, doubling your fee. Of course your charges keep increasing the more experience you get and some will become regulars, so for projection let's say your charge is cumulative and got to $35 by the end of the year. Now for some marketing, give choices to the individual as to how he wants his bj to be, a list like dirty talk(+$5), teasing(+$5), edging(+$5), etc and also increase your price on special occassions like valentine's day. To be more realistic, assume you got about 5% of your total requests cancelled because of some distance issues, fatigue etc. Time for some MAFS.\n\nClients on debut= 10/week= 40 /month\n\n\nClients by the end of the year= 30/week= 120/month\n\n\nTotal sum of clients of the whole year= \nS(12)= 12(40+120)/2= 1920/2= 960 clients\n\n\nAverage fee throughout the year=\n$ (12(20+35)/2)/12= $27.5\n\n\nCancelled clients= 5% of 960= 48 clients\n\n\nValid clients= 960-48= 912 clients= 910(for simplicity)\n\n\nDouble money clients= 30% of 910= 273 clients\n\n\nTotal bjs throughout the year=\n 910+(273/2)= 910+136.5= 1046.5= 1047(approx)\n\n\nTotal money made= $ 1047\u00d727.5= $ 28,792.5\n\n\nWe can round up this number 29k, considering some people chose some options from the type list and it will also make up for all the approximates.\n\nSo realistically you'd only make 29k/year with this business(if you don't overwork and avoid MMF situations), meaning 2.4k per month.",

Also they're not just going to let you sit in a gay bar with a sign saying 'best dick sucker in town, thirty dollars' and they certainly won't want you bothering everyone.\n\nYou're going to need a better business model, there's probably plenty of guys that'd pay thirty if you go visit them at home or meet them in a van, pick them up round the corner and drive them somewhere secluded to drain their balls, give them bread and milk so they can go home with a smile and tell their wife they just walked up to the shop. \n\nYou're selling convenience, efficiency and security more than you're selling a mouth to cum in - you could undoubtedly get customers that want a cock to suck too, probably easier than finding people wanting a blowjob because it's a smaller competing market, women can't participate and there's a limit to how often anyone can perform. Guys at home with their wife desperate to get dirty and degenerate with a hard cock, excited at the idea of organising a secret meeting so you can fuck their face and fill their throat with hot seed. Probably be able to charge a premium especially if their fantasy involves submission or they get off on the idea of spending money on hard cock behind their wives back.\n\nAs your accountant I strongly recommend purchasing a van, a ball waxing kit, and as much cealis and viagra as you can get your hands on. If you alternate giving and receiving jobs then you should be able to maintain performance through maybe five loads a day, the just gone to the shops ruse will ensure the men want to cum fast and waste no time so potentially you could do three cock sucking jobs and fuck one guys face an hour - one fifty an hour, minus fuel and van upkeep -- you're easily clearly five hundred, thousand plus on a good day.\n\nAnother big advantage is the ability to travel, always fresh customers, don't oversaturated your market, plus you can go to towns during events so a guy gets horny he can tell his wife 'im going to go get another round...' or 'wait here I'm just going to line up for the toilet' ten minutes later they're back and you're into your next customer. Park up near a music festival or sports event at close and suck all the sexual frustration out of the guys leaving - give a discount for an even greater reduction in service and you could vastly increase your profits, twenty for five min suck with a line of guys waiting, easy two fifty an hour.\n\nYou're a fool if you don't do this, it's by far your best chance at creating a savings portfolio. Ten years doing grinding and you could retire down to weekends or occasional special events.",
