It's not a purposeful conspiracy or anything, this is just an inevitability of a two party system in a country filled with bourgeois capitalism. You can actually see the exact same thing happening with Australia and the UK, both nominally multi-party systems, but with two predominant parties (Tories & Labour in UK, Liberals & Labor in Aus). Throughout the decades, the Labor parties in each situation have been pulled rightward. In 1917, UK Labour was so radical that Vladimir Lenin considered them to be an ally in the fight against capitalism. Now they're social democrats at best.",

Otherwise, there is little religious freedom of religion in Russia.\n\nHilariously, these \"illegal missionary activities\" also apply to Evangelical Protestantism whose main purpose is to, you know, evangelize. Protestants are the favorite targets of anti-religious laws in Russia and are regularly fined or prosecuted for illegal religious activities.",

It is fair to characterize this as a religious war with Orthodox Christians killing Orthodox Christians.\r  \n\r  \nWith what justification can the GOP supporting Americans give to allowing Christians to be murdered for the sole reason that they are unwilling to subjugate themselves before a dictatorial leader. To condone the suppression of the Christian (or any) religion should be as clear as glass to Americans who live under the protection of the freedom of religion and its rights to freely practice your beliefs.\r  \n\r  \nOne of the American Constitutions core principles is freedom of or from religion and to simply turn a blind eye to the plight of other\u2019s rights is to ignore that \u201cwe are our brother\u2019s keeper\u201d a principal conviction at the heart of Christianity.",
