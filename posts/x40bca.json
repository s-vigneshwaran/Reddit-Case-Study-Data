  "text": "Joe Biden's speech on Democracy could lead to more incensed pastors speaking about politics from the pulpit this Sunday. Here is the IRS form to report churches for political influence.\nOriginally posted by [u/skipperdogs](https://www.reddit.com/u/skipperdogs/) in [r/exchristians](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristians/) and posted to r/atheism byu/moschocolate1. Now is a great time to remind everyone, because Biden's speech on Democracy is already causing the evangelical right to go into overdrive, and the chances of pastors violating their tax exempt status this Sunday by exercising political influence are especially high. It's a great time to hold them accountable.\n\nHere's the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/uwhjdj/time\\_for\\_a\\_new\\_challenge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/uwhjdj/time_for_a_new_challenge/)\n\nThe basics:\n\nSome atheists are now going to services to monitor political influence used by preachers, priests, etc., and reporting them for violation of their tax-exempt status.\n\nUse form [IRS 13909](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f13909.pdf), and check boxes 3-5 or those that apply.\n\nAlso use [form 211](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f211.pdf) to claim whistle blower reward.\n\nHere's the image: [https://i.imgur.com/6TVglyb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/6TVglyb.jpg)\n\nEdit: Many services are transmitted on-line, for those of you who may be too uncomfortable going to a service in person. I understand that hearing these sermons again can be stressful and traumatic, but this is a great opportunity to fight back against how damaging political rhetoric from the pulpit is for the country and for those of us who had to endure it as children until we were able to leave.",

If I knew that wasn't ok then I would have reported it. The pastor also said something about how if Joe Biden is elected then it's over they will shut down the churches etc. Fucking lunacy and Joe Biden is in office and their church is still there.",

Even for people ingrained in a church, they're choosing their religion and fraud over their country and neighbors by not reporting it. It's illegal, frankly pathetic too to be manipulating your neighbors like that; love thy neighbor my butthole, they need to start embracing that one for once.",

As I've had it explained in my Protestant-based studies, the Roman Catholic church considers itself to be the church that emerged out of the myriad historical offshoots from the 300's to the ~1500's including the Protestant schism and the split of the Roman/Byzantine empires. I know the Coptic and Arminian church traditions that ended up in the modern Eastern Orthodox church arose out of the eastern side of that Roman empire split, but I'm not an expert on that. As far as I know the \"catholic\" Christian idea stems from writers as early as Ignatius (110 BCE), but that doesn't mean that eastern traditions have an affiliation with the Roman Catholic Church tradition. \"Roman Catholic\" and \"Christian Catholic\" are historically fraught terms and I admit I don't know the Eastern Orthodox side of it very well. As far as I can tell, both Roman and Eastern Orthodox traditions claim to be \"catholic\" but the term \"Catholic\" tends to refer to Roman Catholics.",

The Catholic mass tends to have more recited parts, like the Nicene Creed, but the beliefs and teachings are mostly the same as the more common Protestant denominations.\n\nThere are countless Protestant denominations, and each one was created because the creator didn't agree with any of the existing denominations. But the biggest denominations, like Anglican, Methodist, Lutheran, and Baptist, are very similar to Catholicism at their core.",

And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life.\n\nSo the penalty for killing a woman\u2019s unborn child is much less than the penalty for murder.

It\u2019s presumed he will talk about the rise of the radical right and the upcoming election. \n\nSunday is a common day for religious services in the United States. \n\nThere is considerable overlap between the radical right and evangelical flavors of Christianity in the US. \n\nThe assumption is that many pastors will feel antagonized by Biden\u2019s speech and speak to their congregation about political ideology\u2026and in doing so violate laws that maintain a church\u2019s tax exemption. \n\nTax exemption for churches is valuable. Many churches could not maintain their organizations if they weren\u2019t subsidized. \n\nAnd many evangelical churches also subscribe to \u201cprosperity gospel\u201d which equates individual enrichment as staying on the good side of god. Aka only bad people are poor. So tax exemption in these environments permits members of the church to hoard wealth in ways that would be illegal for non-tax exempt organizations. \n\nThe speech today is seen as bait for easily triggered pastors to get on topics of politics they cannot and should not talk about in church. And reporting them to lose tax exempt status is a serious consequence for violating the rules.",

We've seen what happens to cults when they drink the Kool aid because they thought the world was ending. The world went on without them. Allowing religion to make up their world view is an entirely personal choice derived from a need to validate a sense of belonging and bring purpose to things they don't understand. The religious think it's easy to live in a godless mindset but the truth is, without God, humanity must take full responsibility for itself.\n\nThere's been nothing throughout recorded history that speaks to the contrary. You can say otherwise  all day long. But the objective truth is no God has ever taken credit. Just like a boogeyman, god is only ever as much as we ascribe to it. And doing so is nothing more than a wasted effort of waxing poetic rather than look at the world through sober eyes. It's comforting, sure, but when has doing things for the sake of comfort ever dissuaded tragedy? It's reactive and traditionalist and provides little tangible benefit to the evolution of humans as a species",

None of it is new.\n\nWhen I left the church and deconverted, the pastor visited me and asked me why I stopped coming to church. I told him straight-out: your sermons are irrelevant, and do nothing to complement my faith. He never talked to me again.

As the IT guy I created the spreadsheet that kept track of the budget\u2026 money in, money out. I did it with my friend\u2019s dad who was assistant to the treasurer. \n\nI learned many years later after I had moved that he \u201cborrowed\u201d some money from the church. Not sure how he got caught but it was really sad to hear. \n\nHe was a super nice guy. His son played bass and sang in our Christian band. I went to the beach with their family a couple times. Slept over their house many times. \n\nThey had a really nice place but when the economy tanked he had to sell it and moved from the rich neighborhood to a not so good one and eventually sold that place and moved to an even cheaper area and eventually had to \u201cborrow\u201d money. \n\nOne of the pastors I translated for, super nice guy as well, had an affair with a member and was kicked out. His wife stayed with him and they started another church. \n\nThe main pastor was an engineer.. really talented. He quit his job to work full time at the church. I thought it was a sacrifice but later realized it was great\u2026 he went from having a boss to being a boss. From working Monday to Friday to working Sunday and May a couple days a week. \n\nI translated for this other missionary multiple weekends but then realized he actually spoke very good Portuguese. That\u2019s when I realized he wanted a translator because it looks more important. I quit translating for him. \n\nI recently reconnected with all my church friends from my adolescence. Sadly they are all just passing down the same brainwashing dogma to their own children. There was only one who like me broke out of it. And another who is trying to break out of it but he said he can\u2019t. It\u2019s too ingrained.",

It reminds me of my one story going to church. \n\nI\u2019m not religious at all but in the days after 9/11/01 I was pretty shook up because I witnessed the whole thing. I was aimlessly walking around the deserted streets of Manhattan, probably on 9/12 or 9/13. And I walked past a church with doors wide open and light streaming out. There was a sermon going on. Not packed but certainly a good number of people in the pews. It was so welcoming.  \n\nI thought to myself, well, if there\u2019s ever a time when I\u2019d be open to some spiritual healing it is right now.  It was really like God was sending me a message. So, I went in, hoping that maybe I\u2019d experience a new awakening. \n\nI sat in a pew. Much to my surprise, the priest wasn\u2019t giving an uplifting sermon about peace but was on a rant about homosexuality. For real. I couldn\u2019t actually believe my ears. He seemed to be intimating that 9/11 happened because of homosexuality. WTF? I really couldn\u2019t even comprehend what was going on. I sat there for a few minutes thinking that maybe I didn\u2019t understand. But I just couldn\u2019t do it. I was so disgusted and walked out. \n\nThat\u2019s the story of my 10 minutes as a religious person.",

Make sure you are engaged in some meaningful way or else you\u2019re not considered a \u201cparty\u201d legally. I suppose if someone is speaking directly to you then that probably makes you a party as well. Not sure. \n\nNot sure how this works with recording of a sermon or something like that.

Having said that church *services* **that are open to the public** are considered public spaces and as such you can record the sermon.\n\nHaving said that, be careful about recording the choir or band or whatever because that falls under copyright law (you can record it all you want... You just can't distribute it). Also, the sermon itself is copyrighted so you can't just go and distribute it after recording *in its entirety*. You can however, distribute portions of it (e.g. the part where they tell their flock to vote one way or another) as that falls under fair use.\n\nThere's another aspect of this that's kinda complicated: If you record a sermon in a two-party consent state and send that to the IRS *the IRS doesn't care*. The recording is still admissible as evidence in a court of *Federal* law because that two-party consent thing is state-specific. The state itself could still come after you but if you recorded evidence of an actual crime they are highly unlikely to do that (because it's a *very* bad look to go after whistleblowers and it's likely to get thrown out *anyway* for loads of reasons not the least of which is the fact that sermons are almost always given to the public; anyone and everyone that'll listen--they're not *supposed* to be private).\n\nDisclaimer: I'm not a lawyer but I had a friend who recorded his boss doing something awful in a two-party state and the AG specifically said he would not have to worry about that since he was recording a crime in progress... Even though the law in my state has no such exemptions.",

What?\n\nI've eulogized two of my immediate family members in a funeral church service. I was told by the robed-daddy that I had 2 minutes and that they wanted to proof-read what I was going to say. I agreed. Day-of comes: I never sent them the eulogy, service begins, I get called up about halfway through to do my thing. Each time, my eulogy lasted about 15-20 minutes, referenced god *zero* times, and spoke to who my family member was and how devastated we all were feeling.\n\nI have never received more compliments for anything I've done more than I was complemented for my eulogy on those two occassions. People were touched emotionally by what I had to say and I was able to create a bond with all over our shared pain of a sudden loss.\n\nIt still boggles my mind how simple it was to do, yet the church serves to heal none of those wounds. They only referenced how the deceased was born a sinner piece of shit and we had to all hurry up to help save them before they burn in hell!\n\nSo yeah. Idk. Fuck em",

And you're right that my father did not have specifics about his wishes because it was a sudden and completely unexpected death. We were not a religious family - not affiliated with any church. I can say for certain that having a hyper-religious send-off at a random church was not the way my father would have chosen to be sent off.\n\nAnd of course I reacted emotionally during a time of extreme emotional pain and loss. This absolutely is a reflection of my personal issues surrounding the church. I was extra-offended because I was in an emotionally vulnerable state, upset at everything that this happened. The loss just felt so cruel. I felt like mine and my family's emotional well-being was ignored. It's absolutely my *opinion* as to what *should* happen after death in terms of a service. That's why I don't subscribe to any church practices... because I disagree. \n\nI personally believe that bringing people together by acknowledging the fact that we are all experiencing varying degrees of pain and sadness is the most powerful and helpful thing we can do. As a result of my eulogy, I discovered that I wasn't the only one who felt some healing from hearing that perspective. Many attendees (who were both religious and non-religious) had the same positive reaction to my emotion-based eulogy. I was surprises it was taken so well. I think of that experience as positive, because it brought commonality between people who hold very different world views. \n\nAs an atheist, I obviously think that the only purpose a funeral holds is to help in the healing process for the living who were left behind. I understand tha lt religious people will see the purpose of a funeral servislce as very different. In the moment though, I was able to \"reach\" everyone there by touching on the common emotion that we all share, regardless of our world-view.\n\nI know I'm rambling. When planning the eulogy, I was angry at everything and thought I was just \"sticking it to the man,\" by breaking these 'rules' given to me by that church. But I was genuinely surprised at the positive reaction I got. I didn't realize until afterwards that I had provided something that this church did not: Empathy for the human emotion we all were overwhelmed by.\n\nJust my two-cents, plus a few dollars of extra words and thoughts.",

When I was in college I was in my \u201cI hate religion\u201d atheist phase.\n\nI befriended a woman who was one of the more intelligent people I\u2019ve met, and she was religious and it confused me.

I couldn't just take it as a gift since it wasn't cheap and he and his wife allowed us to stay in his house for 3 days. I took him and his family out for sushi at a nice restaurant.  He said all he wanted in return was I had to go to church with him and his family,  I agreed and on Sunday we went. I have not and will never step foot in a church again!!!! I couldn't believe the political bullshit being pushed, it was more of a hate rally than a religious service!! I was shocked at the hate towards liberals when the entity they claim to follow was the biggest liberal ever!! Fuck Republican Jesus and fuck the GQP!!! I no longer believe in Christianity, it's all about hate, having power and control.  It all boils down to cash!!!!",

      "text": "For federal income tax purposes most churches qualify for exemption from tax under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Political speech by 501(c)(3) organizations can be divided into two categories:\r  \n\r  \nNot Permitted: Partisan Speech\r  \n\r  \nChurches and other 501(c)(3) organizations have been prohibited from supporting specific political candidates since the passage of the Johnson Amendment in 1954. The Internal Revenue Code provides that, by definition, 501(c)(3) organizations do not \u201cparticipate in, or intervene in (including the publishing or distributing of statements), any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office.\u201d In other words, taking an active role in a political campaign can negate a church\u2019s tax-exempt status. If a church is determined to have violated this rule it may be required to  pay income tax for every year it has failed to qualify for the exemption due to its political activities.\r  \n\r  \nActivities that could risk violating the Johnson Amendment include most forms of material support for a specific political campaign. For example, organizing volunteers to prepare a mailing for a candidate or soliciting donations on behalf of a campaign may expose churches that engage in these activities to risk if they are found in violation of the Johnson Amendment. \r  \n\r  \nIRS guidelines indicate that a church can still engage in nonpartisan political activity without violating these rules. For example, a church can distribute nonpartisan voter information (such as a collection of statements by different candidates). A church can also host debates among candidates. A key focus in these examples will be whether a particular candidate is shown favor, or if the activity is truly neutral.\r  \n\r  \nThe only partisan speech that is allowed to be made by church employees are comments not made in any church facility or in church publications. The comments must include a statement that the opinions being expressed belong only to the individual and are not intended to represent the church.\r  \n\r  \nNot Permitted: \u201cSubstantial\u201d Lobbying\r  \n\r  \nA \u201csubstantial part\u201d of a 501(c)(3) organization\u2019s activities may not be directed at influencing legislation (including regulatory rulemaking). A church is allowed to take positions on issues that are important to it and its congregation. Such \u201cissue advocacy\u201d can even touch on topics that are central to a political campaign without running afoul of the rules. But the line between issue advocacy and candidate endorsement is often blurry, and churches need to think carefully about how their specific context may affect the appropriateness of devoting significant resources or time to an issue that may be construed as partisan.\r  \n\r  \nThe IRS gives a number of parameters that can factor into the partisan character of issue advocacy. The parameters include the proximity to an election, any specific mention of a candidate\u2019s position on the issue, and whether the issue is a key topic of the campaign. Given the stakes involved and the complicated factual analysis required to reach a reliable decision, churches that want to express themselves about issues that are central to ongoing political campaigns should consult with an attorney before taking action.\r  \n\r  \nPermitted: Nonpartisan Speech\r  \n\r  \nFederal law does not restrict a church\u2019s nonpartisan speech. In practice this means that a church may freely encourage its congregation to vote. It may also do other things that touch upon political matters, including:\r  \n\r  \nProviding members of the congregation with nonpartisan information about issues in an election.\r  \nOrganizing voter registration drives.\r  \nHosting candidates as speakers, provided that each candidate on the ballot is given an equal opportunity to participate.\r  \nHolding discussions about the relationship between church doctrine and ballot issues.\n\nhttps://www.churchlawcenter.com/church-law/political-activities-by-churches-whats-permitted-and-whats-prohibited/",

      "text": "Main point: The religious right have to equivocate (read lie) to themselves and others or else it would indicate that God is wrong about something, thus calling into question his authority and goodness. It\u2019s the same way that they dither about slavery and genocide, which YAHWEH clearly loved and condoned. They can\u2019t admit that god is wrong or psychotic, so their wrenched interpretations make him right in  ways that wouldn\u2019t add up at all (it\u2019s very much like a victim not understanding that their spouse or parent could possibly be abusive). The religious right obviously won\u2019t ever be able to see this until they are truly willing to discover truth instead of insisting that their God is the only truth. \n\nFurther explanation:\n\nI grew up in an evangelical, fundamentalist, southern baptist church where my dad was the head pastor. I\u2019ve witnessed all the abuse, and lies, and bs, and it\u2019s all real. This even goes for the political stuff, which was always spouted from my dad\u2019s pulpit. \n\nHowever, it does stem from something very true about that kind of world: the first technique you learn in order to be one of them, is lying. They don\u2019t see it that way, but it comes in two primary forms: \n\n1. (And probably most importantly) Equivocation: You should slink around society, never fully exposing exactly what you believe, so that when you feel the opportunity is right you can spring Jesus on everyone. E.g., you behave as though you like Muslim immigrants and you even learn Arabic religious phrases so you can \u201cbridge\u201d a connection. Then, once you have gotten their attention and trust, you start cramming Jesus down their throat. The thinking is that if you show them your \u201cfruits\u201d (good deeds and charity), then once you reveal that it was Jesus compelling you to be that way, they will want to convert to your \u201ctruth.\u201d For some reason, they are convinced that you must sneakily present the gospel so that others will have to fall in line once they have fully taken over. The eventual goal is so that Pascal\u2019s wager becomes the only way nonbelievers can exist peacefully in their \u201cgodly nation\u201d (read theocracy, which they would never admit is what they wanted unless they feel like they are in control; note how that is happening more and more now). \n\nBut another example is simply when, for instance, my mom used to say something like \u201chymns are the only way to truly worship god\u201d but once people started only attending churches with drums and gym-bro worship leaders, this decimating the offering plate collections, she\u2019ll claim that her statement was about \u201cwhat\u2019s in your heart, not the kind of music.\u201d That\u2019s clearly not what she meant, but she is just playing this equivocation game.\n\n2. God is always right, and since you\u2019re on God\u2019s side, it never matters what you say or do, because it can always be rationalized within the brainwashed ideology that your mind is trapped in (see Augustine\u2019s De Doctrina for this dumbass mindset). E.g., any time a sex predator has authority in your church, you quietly dismiss them, brush it under the rug, then deride anyone who speaks up as not being righteously obedient. Then, after it\u2019s clear that you were wrong by any decent ethical standard,  you claim that it\u2019s just in the past, and you did what God wanted to further the gospel at the time. You do this even if you can\u2019t fully see what God\u2019s mysterious design was for directing their leadership in such an awful way. \n\nAs a result of this lying DNA within the religious right-wingers, they will never be able to criticize themselves or examine what they\u2019d cruelly said. They will always be able to claim that they are right no matter what (maybe one of the reasons they adore Trump) and that all you have to do is take your past atrocities/law-breaking/lies and re-interpret them as part of God\u2019s plan. If you use claims about God\u2019s mystery and about your special and holier connection to god, then you can make the point that your actions may seem\nwrong to the world but God directed you to follow his plan. This  makes what you say, no matter how clearly disproven or vile to any rational outsider, incapable of being criticized as anything but godly. \n\nAnd there millions of these creeps all over America.",

The key takeaway is that discussing issues is still valid so long as it does not endorse or go against a candidate (even just by implication or party). From [Revenue Ruling 2007-41](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/rr-07-41.pdf):\n\nKey factors in determining whether a communication results in political campaign intervention include the following: \n\n\u2022 Whether the statement identifies one or more candidates for a given public office; \n\n\u2022 Whether the statement expresses approval or disapproval for one or more candidates\u2019 positions and/or actions; \n\n\u2022 Whether the statement is delivered close in time to the election; \n\n\u2022 Whether the statement makes reference to voting or an election; \n\n\u2022 Whether the issue addressed in the communication has been raised as an issue distinguishing candidates for a given office; \n\n\u2022 Whether the communication is part of an ongoing series of communications by the organization on the same issue that are made independent of the timing of any election; and \n\n\u2022 Whether the timing of the communication and identification of the candidate are related to a non-electoral event such as a scheduled vote on specific legislation by an officeholder who also happens to be a candidate for public office.\n\nA communication is particularly at risk of political campaign intervention when it makes reference to candidates or voting in a specific upcoming  election. Nevertheless, the communication must still be considered in context before arriving at any conclusions.",

How we can help each other out and seek out others to assist. They paid off debt, funded people's home repairs, medical bills.\n\nThey are in my mind what a church should be. How Christians are supposed to be. They always seemed to care so fiercely about their parishioners. I could go there tomorrow and declare myself an atheist and still they would ask how I am. How is my mother? What I've been up to.\n\nIt seems to me that my old church is becoming an oddity and is not the norm.",

And they certainly thought that a religious citizenry was important to good government; but they did not intend to set up a Christian regime under our founding documents. Our civil compact, the Constitution, is a decidedly secular document. It never mentions \u201cChristianity.\u201d Even the word \u201creligious\u201d is used only once in Article VI to ban religious tests for public office. And then two years later the Bill of Rights starts off \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\u201d This language dispelled any lingering doubt whether America was intended to be a Christian nation when it prevented the federal government from advancing or inhibiting any religious tradition.\n\nhttps://bjconline.org/top-5-myths-of-separation-of-church-and-state/",

You can just as easily have a capricious tyrant that demands compliance while providing little to nothing in return. That's how they want it, a one way street. We don't have to do shit for you, you go broke and you're gonna end up in our expansive carceral system, but you have to comply as if we're a cohesive society.

When people cease to believe in their own fallibility, then it is only a matter of time before violent fanaticism enters the equation. By definition, a dogmatist cannot be reasoned with, nor can a false doctrine ever be defended reasonably.* ***Reason itself therefore cannot settle any disputes, which leaves blunt authority as the only viable alternative.*** *To make matters even worse,* ***the very act of disagreement is not interpreted as a simple intellectual confusion, but an implicit moral failure.*** *Nonbelievers are automatically presumed guilty of unspecified crimes by the mere virtue of their nonbelief. Violent oppression is thus easily justified, which makes violent resistance an eventual necessity.*",

For instance look at how many different sects there are in just the Christian religion. England did not separate the church and state and the authority there could justify passing down judgement for however they wanted to based on which interpretation they wanted to use.\n\nEssentially if a church wants to break away from that separation they lose their tax exempt status. There\u2019s also problems that arise from religious leaders swaying their congregation to vote the way they want them to by telling them it\u2019s what god wants etc.",

Foreigners. Homeless.  Poor.  Universal Healthcare.  Universal Basic Income.  Welfare.  Minimum Wage.\nI'm more than happy to report these entities who choose not to follow the law.",

That pastor claimed that he voluntarily gave up tax exempt status for his church, which of course fucks over all of the people that donate money to it because they can no longer take a tax deduction for it. He never offered any proof that he really did it, though. \n\nIt's extraordinarily rare for a church to lose its tax exempt status for engaging in campaigning. I dug into it once and found only one example back in the 90s. I forget the exact details but the church took out a full page ad right before an election that mentioned the candidates by name. Trump even held rallies at churches and nobody got in any trouble.\n\nRather than going to the service to file a report that will go nowhere, you might be better off standing outside the church before and after with a sign. Here's some suggestions that can maybe get some of them face the hypocrisy of their pastor railing against student loan forgiveness.\n\n>Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed. \n\n\u2013 Proverbs 19:17\n\n>Bear one another\u2019s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. \n\n\u2013 Galatians 6:2\n\n>You shall not charge interest on loans to your brother, interest on money, interest on food, interest on anything that is lent for interest.\n\n\u2013 Deuteronomy 23:19",
