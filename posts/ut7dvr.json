  "text": "My money worshipping evangelical grandparents ran a puppy mill from their barn and it showed me how much evangelical Christians value money over life.\nMy dad\u2019s parents were both mega church attending evangelical Christians.  They owned a construction business and we\u2019re decently successful so they always made a big show of their \u2018generosity\u2019 by donating some new addition for the church or traveling to some other country to build a school or church (it had to have their name or company name on it or associated with it).  They were always involved in church activities and constantly put down anyone they didn\u2019t think was Christian enough.  Their gossip about others was nasty and mean so I had never viewed them as \u2018good\u2019 but I had no idea how bad they really were. \nSo, despite being so successful, my grandfather had a secret side business.  His father had bred Dalmatians and he continued that himself.  I was almost 10 before I even knew about it.  There was an old barn on the edge of their property that we never really went near because it was so far from the house.  I never saw any dogs on their property ever and never would have even thought they had dogs.  One day, my dad needed to see his dad about something and he drove down to the barn to speak with him and I happened to be in the truck. We got out and I was stunned when we went in the barn\u2026Dalmatians in little cages stacked high all around the walls and in the middle of the barn.  Worse, there were dead ones (puppies and adult) in a corner.  I just remembered it smelled really bad and the dogs just kinda whimpered constantly.  I was horrified.  \nWhen we got back in the truck I asked my dad about the dogs.  He told me grandpa breeds dogs and sells them.  I told him I have never seen dogs running around.  He said they never leave that barn, they\u2019re born there and then sold.  I said some of the dogs were adults and he told me those were used for making more dogs so they stay but the rest get sold.  He literally seemed to think nothing of this.  I asked about the dead dogs and he said not all dogs are \u2018born right\u2019 so they get put down. My grandparents constant need to be seen as super Christian was already off putting to me but finding this \u2018secret\u2019 dog business showed me something darker. \n\nBy the time I was a teen I knew a little more of the truth of this barn.  They talked openly about the business at times.  They literally were the worst of the worst type of dog breeder.  This group of dogs were the same line his father had so they\u2019re all very inbred.   He would kill many of them due to the serious health problems that made them unable to be sold.  However, he knowingly bread deaf dogs saying that \u2018it\u2019s not guaranteed their puppies will be deaf.\u2019  He bred them constantly to make up for how many had to be put down.  These dogs never saw a vet, never left that barn, rarely even left the dirty cages and lived a life of pure hell.  I only went back in the barn one other time.  My dad had injured his back and told me to help him bring newspaper down to the barn for the cages.  I remember seeing so many caged dogs.  I saw 2 mother dogs scrawny, laying there on urine soaked newspaper, unable to stand, missing teeth and with wounds on their body\u2026and very pregnant.  I also realized he literally killed dogs by hitting them with a bat when I saw a bat with blood and dog bits on it next to a pile of dead dogs.  My grandfather was taking pictures and choked a puppy that whined too much and wouldn\u2019t be still when he took it out of its cage to be photographed for sale. He had no issue with how he treated these dogs and had no problem brutally killing these animals.  My dad and his mom also didn\u2019t seem to have any issues with this \u2018business\u2019. My grandfather referred to the dogs as \u2018merchandise\u2019, they literally only had monetary value\u2026he didn\u2019t care that they were living creatures (supposedly made by his God).\n\nWhen I had first seen the barn, I was little (9) and it was brief so I had questioned if maybe I was just not remembering right.  I thought they sold the dogs and they just didn\u2019t think of them as pets so they must have been unintentionally mean.  However, after the second time I saw the barn when I was 14, I knew it was worse than I remembered.  I was so disturbed I told my mom.  By this time my parents were divorced.  My mom said she vaguely knew about the dog breeding but had no idea it was this.  She called the county and humane society and anonymously reported it.  Nothing every happened  with the report\u2026.but I refused to ever see my grandparents again and limited my visits with my dad.  I often wonder if the person disregarded the whole report because so many people in town went to that church  and my grandparent were obviously \u2018good Christians\u2019.  \n\nMy grandparents sent me bibles, religious books, cards, etc\u2026for years trying to get me to \u2018return to Jesus\u2019 but I never replied. They stayed active in that church until they died.  My mom did mention that she drove past that church a year or so ago and they had renamed the huge addition my grandparents built after some other local rich religious nut.  Shows you only matter to the church for the money\u2026my grandparents and their church did have the same values after all.",

The only thing that made it easier to deal with and work past is knowing that we did everything we could for her. Reading something like this really pulls those memories back up to the forefront. \n\nI can't imagine the kind of cruelty and heartlessness it takes to wilfully inflicting that kind of suffering on a living, feeling creature, especially one that depends on and needs you.

This keeps meat prices artificially lower to make up for the inefficient costs of creating it.\n\nIn spite of all this, it's a lot cheaper to buy plant protein than most expect. Just don't rely on the pricier impossible/beyond meat. Beans, lentils, chick peas, tofu, and most grains are extremely cheap and offer great protein sources.

This is how you are to treat all the cities that are far away from you and are not among the cities of these nations. However, you must not let any living thing survive among the cities of these people the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance. You must completely destroy them \u2014 the Hittite, Amorite, Canaanite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite \u2014 as the Lord your God has commanded you, so that they won\u2019t teach you to do all the detestable things they do for their gods, and you sin against the Lord your God. \u201cWhen you lay siege to a city for a long time, fighting against it in order to capture it, you must not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them, because you can get food from them. You must not cut them down. Are trees of the field human, to come under siege by you? But you may destroy the trees that you know do not produce food. You may cut them down to build siege works against the city that is waging war against you, until it falls.\r\n\nDeuteronomy 20:13\u202d-\u202c20\n\nYour ignoring the rest of that chapter where it instructs the israelites to slaughter all the mean and keep the women and children for themselves. What do you think they did with those women? Not to mention it says right after to cut down any and all trees that don't have fruit, to build weapons. there are also other times where \"god\" instructs them to \"dash their babies upon the rocks.\" These new meaning are just that. *NEW* meanings. They've been translated over and over from their original language and reinterpreted to have a new meaning, a very common practice among Jewish scholarship. \n\nTLDR: Those verses didn't mean what you think they meant.

I double checked and your right, genesis was written down in an ancient form of Hebrew. I had mixed up the cuneiform tablets and the genesis accounts. We have cuneiform tablets reciting the Babylon flood myth that mirror Noah's flood, but are much much older, showing us that the story of Noah's flood was heavily influenced by the Babylonian culture and legends. That was my mistake cuneiform wasn't a Semitic language but Babylonian.",

I no longer support animal agriculture, and I no longer hold the homophobic and sexist beliefs that I did as a Christian. I\u2019m a much better person now, so I think it is ironic that there are Christians who actually believe you can\u2019t be moral without being Christian.\n\nScary how similar our sentiments are/were.

Those foster kids were basically put in a room on the far side of the house and left in diapers with a TV playing veggie tales 24/7.

The second came from a loving home and was the sweetest little dog.  The third was an SPCA rescue, an ~18 month female that was born in a puppy mill and kept as breeding stock because she had a bad hip and a collapsed trachea affecting her breathing making her unlikely to sell.  Although she was only about 18 months when we got her, she had already had at least two litters according to our vet.  Being so tiny, the pregnancy damaged her internal organs, and when she was fixed at the spca they couldn't get all the hormone producing tissue, so she still goes into heat.  We've taken great care of her, and she'll turn 14 sometime around next month, but the effects of her first 18 months are apparent in her gait and her breathing.\n\nFuck these people, I hope they all get shut down and fined into bankruptcy.",

      "text": "This is horrendous. I agree wholeheartedly with everyone here that calls out animal abuse.\n\nSince you do care about animal abuse, look into the reality of animal agriculture, behind industry propaganda of lush pastures and 'happy animals'. The standard, legal practices in animal agriculture are horrendously abusive. See watchdominion.org for a rundown of standard legal practices in all major animal industries.\n\nSince most people scroll by, let me give some examples of standard practices:\nWe agree that abusing a dog is wrong. Now a question: Would it be worse to kick a dog, or to slit their throat? You can be 100% certain that an animal has been killed at a fraction of their lifespan for any meat you eat. Most chickens are killed at 6 weeks of age, even though they can live to 15 years. At those 6 weeks they suffer from lameness because their legs and joints cannot support the unnaturally large weight they have been bred to grow to within just 6 weeks, and they suffer ammonia burns and respiratory illness from standing and laying in their own feces.\n\nEgg-laying chickens are a different breed from broiler chickens used for meat, and grow more slowly. Only females lay eggs of course, and so the male chicks are considered useless. They are disposed of on their first day of life most commonly by being ground up alive in macerators, or sometimes by being gassed or suffocated in bags. The females have it worse. The ancestors of chickens laid around 12 eggs per year, but we have artificially bred chickens to lay more than 300. This places a large toll on their bodies and many hens suffer from osteoporosis because their calcium goes to making eggs. Most 'cage-free' or 'free-range' chickens are kept in large sheds in incredibly cramped conditions. To optimize productivity it is most efficient to pack as many chickens as possible in a single shed, even if that causes a few percent of chickens to die from the bad conditions. It is the productivity per shed and per input of feed that matters, not the productivity per chicken.\n\nWhy does a cow give milk? Because she has a baby. To run a profitable business, a dairy farmer artificially impregnates their cows every year, then takes away the baby almost as soon as it's born because otherwise they would drink the milk that the farmer wants to sell. Cows and calves have a very strong bond and being separated causes intense anguish.\nMale dairy calves are sold for veal or meat, or just killed at the farm as an undesirable 'waste product'. Cows have been bred to produce as much milk as possible, which also causes them to have high rates of mastitis, udder infection. After 5-6 years of continuous pregnancy the cow's body has either given up completely, or her milk production declines to where it's more profitable to replace her and so she is sent to slaughter. Cows can live to 25.\n\nTL:DR We agree dog abuse is bad. Research the legal, standard practices that are used in animal agriculture and you'll see that similarly egregious abuse is inherent in animal agriculture. Watchdominion.org\n\nFor help making the switch to a lifestyle that doesn't contribute to animal abuse: Challenge22.com\n\nMore info in the sidebar of: r/vegan",

With that said, research can only get you so far, experiencing first hand gives you a much better understanding. Most of you will likely never have an opportunity to live on an actual farm and see where food comes from, so I did it for you! I come from a long line of farmers in European country,  and although I grew up in the city, I spent a few years with my relatives helping on their farms.\n\nLush pastures and happy animals do exist. You won't find their meat in grocery stores though. Those animals are well cared for and slaughtered as painlessly as possible. Humans are omnivores, and while we technically can get nutrition from plant sources, it does not mean it is feasible or healthy for everyone. Some vegans will go as far as feeding their cats (obligatory carnivores) plant based food, which I consider animal abuse. But I digress. Bottom line is, it is entirely possible to not abuse animals and to still continue eating them. We've been doing it for thousands of years, and only recently we've become so disconnected from our food sources. Animals can be food, they can be pets, and as long as they are treated humanely, don't let anyone guilt trip you for being human.",

Whether you're a farm worker having to feed way too many calves or a nurse with 4 patients on a shift, we can't do it, and neglect, frustration, mistakes and horrific abuse are the result.\n\nThere is farming that allows for cows to run around in the mountains and chase tourists for fun (including yours truly) and have an absolute blast. It's expensive though, and we consumers aren't willing to pay for it. \n\nI have seen people refuse to pay a mere euro more for local dairy that would have ensured survival of farmers whose cows get to jump around in the mountains, but then turn around and reduce meat/whine about factory farming. They also then eat avocados (drought inducing), almond dairy (drought inducing),  quinoa (drought inducing, soil stripping, and indigenous culture destroying), trying to get their nutrients in, all shipped with fossil fuels (war inducing) to the EU. Cool, but you could have also just bought the butter, supported better practices, including sustainability, culture, and securing a local food supply which keeps the factory agriculture out, and ultimately supported less global suffering of all animals (human animals included) all around. \n\nSome animals eat other animals, including the aforementioned chickens (which are omnivores) and pigs (which are ominvores). If you are able to go vegan more power to you. I prefer a flexitarian approach.\n\nBut I support small farming practices because it secures our food, if harnessed could really move the needle on environmental issues, and is interwoven in cultural practices.",

              "text": "A lot of what I described is standard even in small farms though. All egg-laying chickens come from breeders that kill the male chicks and have the parent chickens living in awful conditions. And all are selectively bred to lay as many eggs as possible, which is not good for their health or well-being.\n\nMilk cows are also bred for maximum milk production giving them a high risk of udder infection and discomfort. They need to be artificially impregnated every year and give birth to keep up milk production. And even small farms separate mother and child almost immediately because otherwise the calf would drink the milk that the farmer needs to sell.\n\nThings like branding, castrating without anaesthetic are common. And the most important: All of these sentient beings will be killed at a fraction of their lifespan. The egg-laying chickens and cows used for milk when their production declines, and the animals raised for meat when they reach slaughter weight. \n\nHow is it acceptable to end the life of another individual for a kind of meal that we do not need? For taste pleasure and convenience?\n\nKeeping it to the topic of this thread: Is it acceptable for me to kill my dog if I've treated them well before killing them? \nThere is a real-life scenario of this, where a YouTube family killed their healthy dog browser. They faced some serious backlash becaguse people (rightly imo) consider this unacceptable.\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=eEGDe6qTl7M\n\nAnd this small family dog meat farm, producing organic dog meat:\nwww.Elwooddogmeat.com",

Why do people seek religion, esp evangelism? Usually because they are at a point in their life where they are questioning the purpose of life, and thus, their existence within this time and universe. \n\nThe utter aspect that there is no after life, that there is no final forgiveness, and that there will be no chance to fix one's mistakes is horrifying at first glance. There being nothing in the end means that one's actions are final and thus, their actions create final judgements of their character. Every atheist has confronted this. Some still feel anxiety over the thought. \n\nBut think about who the type of person who would immediately reject the notion of no afterlife, thus no redemption, would be: someone who is easy to influence through psycho-emotional appeals and furthermore, those who feel guilty about their past actions. Hell, it must be easy to indulge in extralegal and extrabiblical behavior when you are forgiven for it by an external source that is not the judicial system. With no afterlife, their character is forever imprinted in time. Facing reality would make them feel so much shame and disappointment that they would rather deny it. Thankfully, it appears religion is just having a final kick out as the toxicity of Christianity spreads via the internet and more people see its ugly face.",

Are the few groups left who are not part of our modern society evil? If Russia launches its nuclear arsenal and destroys our infrastructure will the people who don\u2019t have access to the variety of plant material needed for a proper diet be evil?\n\nPretty much everything we hold on a high moral position does not change with the times. Murder, slavery, being a dick etc are evil because the act in and of itself is evil. You are only able to say that bacon is akin to puppy torture because you are privileged.",

Either when their bodies give up after constant pregnancy and milking or egg-laying, or when their production declines to an unprofitable level.\nI encourage you to research what the standard, legal practices are that animals are subjected to within these despicable industries.

My first dog as a kid was rescued from a puppy mill after breeding for 6 years and she was terrified of the world. Now I regularly foster dogs, and many of them are also puppy mill survivors. Many of them are too scared to even be touched, and I met one who didn't even know how to walk. \n\nSadly, the only reason puppy mills keep operating is because people are supporting them, sometimes without knowing. Pet stores and online puppy sellers are almost always puppy mills. So, if anyone reading this is currently looking for a dog, please do your research. I definitely recommend a rescue dog - they're just as sweet as any other dog and they deserve so much love!",
