It did take a while for us to get lowercase letters and punctuation (early Middle ages) so if you're talking about reading the actual early formats you wouldn't be wrong",

When you\u2019re used to good writing, stuff like this is like someone in music singing out of tune, or coming in on the wrong beat. And there\u2019s no need for it. A professional editor will knock the grammar into your book for under a thousand bucks. You can\u2019t get character or structure fixed for that, but at least you\u2019ll have your tenses straight. \n\nMy favourite way to read reviews is to read the one stars first. Its a convention among Kindle readers that if there\u2019s something wrong with the Kindle formatting they give it a one star. And every now and then you hit someone who knows what they\u2019re talking about, furious at the garbage being peddled, and giving better recommendations. \n\nI miss when you could reply to Amazon reviews. I\u2019ve been in some amazing conversations. And there\u2019s that one woman who kept destroying filter papers in her Hario pourover and thought it was garbage, and I was desperate to tell her she was using the wrong shaped filters because I did exactly the same thing myself.",

There's exceptions, Worm was great, and so were The Martian and PHM, but in general I end up disliking them more often than not. \n\nI don't think it's anything to do with the publishing industry, however, my theory is that it's just easier to wait a few decades, and if a book is still popular after all that time, there's probably a reason for it. With newer books it's harder to tell",

The new generations of anime creators grew up watching nothing but anime, meaning that there\u2019s no new perspectives being introduced. The second is a little bit more complicated. The main flaw of anime rom coms is that none of the elements of the story exist independent from the main character. Where there would normally be a 3 dimensional character you see from many sides, you see a 2 dimensional character from one sole source. Everything else in these animes that people complain about is simply a symptom of this affliction. The incest shit happens because the writers end up leveraging every possible cookie cutter easy to understand the basis of type relationship, one of those is a sibling relationship. I fucking hate it because it\u2019s a really simple problem with an unthinkable solution. That\u2019s because the solution lowkey alienates the audience the anime is meant for.",

Yes, AoT does that; and it's why it feels continuous and thought out, but it isn't why it's good. It's good because it has great world building, gets viewers invested in a complex ensemble cast with a lot of character development, has solid relatable themes, high value animation and exciting action sequences, and most importantly; drip feeds big revelations and throws in twists at just the right pace to keep the viewers engaged.\n\nSaying \"oh it's just popular because the guy actually planned out the story ahead of time\" implies people will go apeshit over any story with the most basic level of structure. Which just isn't the case. It nails all the standard requirements of a good composition, and consistently maintains that quality over a decade of seasons. Do other shows do it better? Absolutely.

The storyboarding and exposition is some first year uni shit\n\nI have to say, objectively this is an ignorant sentence. People don\u2019t just love it because it\u2019s dark and gory. Just that sentence alone proves you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. There are many shitty animes out there, but AoT is simply not one of them. The storytelling is far above many western TV shows and movies. The amount of parallels, interesting characters, moments of tension that AoT brings is not to be overlooked. Most people who actually dive into the world of AoT will acknowledge that it is a great show. You\u2019re attempt at criticising it is just bad.\n\nFirst you say it\u2019s barely above shonen, which is not true but you don\u2019t even give a reason for why you think that. Then you make the statement that people only love it because it\u2019s dark eventhough that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. Most people actually love it because of the depth of the story. And you finish it off by saying the storytelling is \u201cfirst year uni shit\u201d. By your logic, the storytelling in every superhero movie is some high school project.",

GTO legit has some soul.\n\nFuck the anime ending tho, i heard the manga one was much better and it went on for quite a while longer while maintaining the same quality if not better.

Some may say that watching Naruto was like having a parent, I had a friend who didn't have parents and always related to Naruto growing up, he worked his ass off, and proved everyone wrong, he know is super successful, happy, wealthy, family, etc. He is now writing a book and emphasizes Naruto was like the bus in his life that took him to the last stop, he said not having parents kinda made him not want to get on that bus. The bus analogy he always uses is his form of motivation and in a way, saying thank you, even though it's just a show, sometimes the message and good things Masashi Kishimoto put in Naruto had a bigger impact then he probably initially thought, he has fostered and manifest morality through a popular, awesome, emotional, action cartoon which is very hard to do in this day and age.\ufeff This is why I consume no other media and spend all of my free time solely rewatching the 3 episodes of plot and 1,800 episodes of filler while basing my entire personality on the show",

Awful narrative arc which often boils down to revealing a 'twist' that's completely made up on the spot as though it's clever to just invent something new to subvert expectations (spoiler, that's lazy writing). Overtly creepy and sexist since the target audience is clearly weeby virgins, so doing things like spying on Lisa Lisa getting undressed and taking a bath through a keyhole is a totally acceptable and normal thing for the main character to do. All in all Jojo is just lazy and kind of a desperate attempt to appeal to people through all show and zero substance.\n\nBut hey if you like it you do you.",

Tatami galaxy, Cowboy Bebop, girls last tour, Ping Pong the animation are just some amazing anime that I think msot believe is fantastic and are below 50 episodes. Also, a new episode every week meant a whole lot of filler, which many times resulted in the plot getting stuck, and also it meant a reduced visual quality of the anime, so there certainly is a balance before going all out with 100s of episodes. I'd say an anime that is quality while being long is monogatari, while it's controversial and it deserves to be since it has some sus shit, it has remarkable visual quality for over a 100 episodes and suffers from no filler, but that's the advantege from being based on a book series instead of a manga series.",

The filler for a anime like Naruto is a lot of the time caused because the anime has reached the manga or other manga related problems so they have to deviate until the conditions to continue are met, meaning that filler arcs generally don't have a motive for the series but for the producers. Meanwhile, the filler in Bebop is normally has a function as exposition and character establishment. It has a series motive and increases it's value, making the world more believable and the characters more engaging, while doing filler for a production motive is generally rushed and only serves to reduce the characters to tropes and present them to uninteresting settings.",

I've been thinking about this for a bit now and I think the original Planet of the Apes is a decent example of this. Whereas something like the original Star Trek I still think holds up despite it being a little cheesy.)\n\nEdit: Avatar is another example of this in my view. \n\n(That being said, Alien was a good movie from my first watching of it a little while back and Endless Waltz is a good movie as well.)",

It only after playing the remaster did I realize how important a good progression system is/was to the multiplayer experience. But the overal gameplay felt perfectly fine even by modern standards and was still fun to play.

If you're just doing something that isn't new at all, no matter how well you do it, it won't ever be a \"great\" work. And in time, everything will get repeated, reworked, tweaked, and referenced into the ground if it DOES add something new, because it's creator found new ground to exploit.\n\nTime will eventually devolve every great work into a series of tropes and outdated styles of writing as media evolves. Like if you wrote the Odyssey now, it would never get published because the editors would think you're on drugs; it has no modern structure.",

(Which is my beef with a number of art pieces. Sure it's new and different, but is it still any \"good\"?)\n\nI'm reading the Iliad right now and while I agree the writing strucutre is different from basically anything else you read today, 1) the prose by Pope is very nice but often requires multiple read throughs to understand what's going on. 2) I do like how much personality the gods are given and how involved they are and 3) For whatever reason, I seem to enjoy how theatrical and dramatic the characters are.",

      "text": "honestly same. when i saw one anime back in 2018 and i kinda liked it i started watching animes but the more i watch the more i lost interest, it always has inappropriate scenes with girls with big boobs always showing on the screen not to mention how children and teenagers are heavily sexualized because it appeals to their sick audience. and the cringe humor only braindead people would laugh at. i was very disgusted by it and barely even liked it, but i didn't have any other interests and nothing interested me or excited me so i convinced myself i liked it, even though i'm even embarrased to show it to my family because of how many inappropriate scenes it had. in 2021 i started watching it less and less until i stopped because i found some other stuff that interested me, i tried to catch up on it again but i just couldn't so i decided to stop completely because it's just not my preference. i bet the reason a lot of people watch anime is because of how hyped up it is. the anime community can make the worst garbage you'll ever see appealing, that's honestly my experience with most popular animes that is always talked about, bruh any movie you'll ever see will have a better story and characters, but that's just my opinion.",
