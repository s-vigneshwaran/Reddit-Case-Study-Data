      "text": "In case you haven't noticed, they've been doing this for decades. Obama was blamed for the economic crash which started in 2007. He was blamed for the war on terror, which was started by the republicans. He was blamed for the troubles in Iraq and Afghanistan, both started by republicans. He was blamed for the sudden withdrawal from Iraq, which created a power vacuum, that was signed by Bush. Biden was blamed for the pandemic casualties already in March 2021. Biden was blamed for a sudden and chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, that was signed by Trump.\n\nRepublicans do things they know will hurt people and the US, so that they can win elections and stuff their pockets while blaming it on the democrats. They've been doing this for many decades.",
