If someone smiles and nods when you're going on a rant about one of your opinions, but they still choose to take time out of your day to hang out with you, that means they think you're on average a good person to have in their life. And that's a good thing! No one is a good friend 100% of the time, everyone has a little bit of BS they put up with from their friends.\n\nIf anyone is worried about scaring their friends away by revealing their edgy opinions, focus on those moments being rare. Try to keep your political rants or whatever to a minimum, where you're usually a pleasant person to be around, but they still get a chance to see the real you. It's surprisingly effective at not driving people off. (Fun fact: Before social media this was called \"normal socializing\".)",

So this hinges on 1. someone sitting near me and 2. them not being otherwise occupied with somebody else.\n\nAnd even then, sometimes it feels weird initiating. They're going to think \"why is this guy I don't know just talking to me all of a sudden?\".\n\nDespite that I have sometimes gotten into conversations with others. But the other issue is that I just have no idea what to say, my mind goes blank. Other person says they're interested in x, I just think \"ok\".
