As if somehow the scammer isn't an asshole for exploiting people because these people don't notice it - it's like saying a thief isn't as guilty if he robs you while you're asleep.\n\nMost of these gullible people who fall for obvious scams are usually poorly educated but have a lot of empathy. Oftentimes they are already struggling with money, hence why they're willing to help others and are eager to receive the claimed reward/sum. Such a scam can seriously impact their financial well-being, health and social position. It's often depicted as laughably simple to avoid scams but, from their perspective, they are not choosing to trust someone against their better judgement. They lack that better judgement. They are often actually mentally and emotionally incapable of recognising a scam in the moment it's happening. It's just the way their brain works.\n\nIt's our responsibility, as a society, to educate and look out for people who easily fall victim to scams. And we have to fight the scumbags that abuse the empathy and na\u00efvety of their victims. By blaming the victim for not seeing what, to us, seems obvious we only alienate them while, simultaneously, excusing the scammer and normalising the existence of these scams.",

It means that they can prevent bad things from happening to them by being smart or careful rather than simply falling victim to random acts of carnage or malevolence. That's why, when someone is randomly punched or attacked, people automatically assume 'they must have said something'; the person saying that probably keeps to themselves and thus they assume such a random act wouldn't happen to them. It's a self soothing technique.",
