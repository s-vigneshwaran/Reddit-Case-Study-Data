              "text": "Literally true though, except it wasn't Russia doing it, it was the CIA.  Anyone who thinks Trump wasn't part of the deep state's plan is deluding themselves.  2016 is when the hyperpolarization psyop really went into full swing and it couldn't have gone better for them; if you think anyone is allowed to be president without the deep state's approval, I have an election to sell you.  He would have gotten JFK'd before the primaries if he was even remotely threatening to a NWO plan.  He also allowed them to get Biden in who never would have won in a normal election year.  Him getting elected in 2024 is part of the plan too, I think, because he's going to win unless they make Biden step down and replace him with someone like AOC--who I would unironically vote for because she would be the youngest president ever and in general would just be an absolute chaos vote, way more than a 2016 chaos vote for Trump.  But if that's what they want me to do, is it really a chaos vote?  Maybe rather just play minecraft desu\n\nAnyway all presidents are awful",
