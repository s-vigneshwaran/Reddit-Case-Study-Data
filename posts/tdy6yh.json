Why?  -Because women ARE in charge of our society.  Any other \u201creading\u201d of this situation is total bullshit.  When a woman isn\u2019t even questioned for heaping praise on a man for being \u201cso hot,\u201d and a man would be completely shamed for daring to say that, or even arrested and labeled a misogynist, then it\u2019s obvious we live in a society that is 100% biased in favor of females.\n\nDo I think SOME males somewhere are still getting away with sexism and asking female employees to sleep with them for a promotion?  Yeah, I\u2019m sure it happens everywhere\u2026but it\u2019s not legal, like it would be if a woman did it on national television, for all to see\u2026and no one complains.  No one but US, I mean.\n\nShe should have just ended her \u201ccompliments\u201d (which were obviously making him uncomfortable), with, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely vote for you if you sleep with me.\u201d  She might as well have\u2026What farther bias would she have to put out there for all to see?\n\nYou know what perpetuates sexism and gross favoritism being shown for sexual reasons?!  -It\u2019s when women immediately take up the role of the oppressor, as soon as it\u2019s supposedly vacated by their destroying the men who previously held that place.  You know when it\u2019s clear someone has no moral compass?  -It\u2019s when they jump into the role of dictator as soon as they have the chance.",
