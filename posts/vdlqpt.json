The list is very VERY long and I have skipped the counts of embezzlement, the pulling out of the Paris accords, the refusal to be removed from office after losing the elections, and so much more...\nHe was definitely worse that most previous presidents, it is important to keep in mind as sine the republicans seem on good way to crush democrats the next time, their new puppet will have to be held accountable next time as he barely was before...",

Which, in all fairness, I'm a respectful person. I can get along with anybody, frankly. And honestly, it was both very beautiful and very sad. Because I'm someone who acts respectfully. We won the debate, other than, you know, some crooked polls. The beauty of me is that I'm VERY rich, but I am usually graceful.  I'll compare my IQ with anybody, okay? I would have said it's all in the messenger; fellas, and it is fellas because you know, they don't, they haven't figured that the women are smarter right now, so my doctor said I am graceful.

Now, of course correlation doesn\u2019t equal causation. But it\u2019s interesting how left leaning men are said go with group sex as the wildest thing, and would *likely* also tell you to your face they\u2019re up for the idea\u2014this isn\u2019t unique to left leaning men, but it\u2019s interesting that it stops there, or is at least reported as such. \n\nWhereas a man on the far right would, say, sling a racial slur at a man for looking at his daughter at a gas station (just an example), then go home and watch some age/incest/race-play\u2014either aware of the irony or unaware. \n\nSo\u2014I think there\u2019s definitely something there, if my two cents mean anything.",

But when we are talking about Trump spreading the \u201cBig Lie\u201d about the 2020 election, I think it\u2019s important to be specific. He lost the popular vote by a historic margin; more people voted for Hillary Clinton than any other losing candidate in US history to that point. The electoral college is undemocratic and consistently favors Republican candidates who are not broadly popular with Americans. And, like I said, there was definitely a disinformation war that swung things in his favor.

And he is the legitimate PUSA, and your guy's illegitimate, and the American people are awakening to that.\" \u2014Steve Bannon, [June 2022](https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2022/06/12/steve-bannon-jan-6-hearings-garland-toobin-acosta-sot-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/this-week-in-politics/)\n\nIs so important to never comment on this as if it's some whim of Trump the loser man-baby. This is a concerted group effort to sow discord, chaos, and civil war in the United States, allowing a post-democratic fascist state to govern unopposed. And that group includes multiple people who now sit on the US Supreme Court, and who have *personally* been fighting for this outcome since [Gore beat Bush](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/17/politics/bush-v-gore-barrett-kavanaugh-roberts-supreme-court/index.html).\n\nThis is what's really happening. Trump's *very useful* narcissism is not the story here.",

I realized the independent volunteer who stayed 15 hours like the rest of us did not have anything he could vote on. No referendums or anything like it. We also had to refuse about a dozen independent voters who were not aware our state was a closed primary. And honestly it really rubbed me the wrong way that this guy could help others vote but couldn't do so himself.\n\nI understand the arguments for keeping a closed primary state the way it is. It prevents a scenario where Republicans vote for a controversial Democrat in the primary to increase the chances of their side winning (or vice versa) and I cannot believe this is the excuse for keeping the status quo. Congrats, now the Republicans just have to register as democrats a couple weeks prior to the primary and ta da, they can still vote for the less electable candidate to fuck over the party. It's just one more step, why the fuck are we keeping so many from being able to express their views? \n\nBoth my in laws couldn't vote and I know plenty more who can't. My father in law doesn't say \"drats, now I can't fuck over democrats\". He gets upset and angry that on primary day, he has less of a voice as a citizen of our locality/state/nation than I do. Same with the independent dude who gave up an entire day to help old ladies put the ballot in the machine properly. That bugged me the entire day I was helping just like it bugs me that in my in laws can't express their vote either. I really don't think that's fair and it makes the cynicism about our voting much harder to refute. It's just asking for apathy. \n\nWhy the fuck haven't states like pa fixed this yet?? Is it a lack of will from voters or is it fear from the politicians?",

Many states have open primaries where at the day of the primary you tell them which ballot you want Democrat, Republican, or Independant, and they'll give you that ballot.  And a couple states have fully open primaries where you can vote for republican or democrat, and the top two regardless of party advance to the general election.\n\nhttps://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/primary-types.aspx#closed",

This isn't me coming from a place of patriotism. \n\nThey are hands-down the most powerful military in the world. Of the top ten air forces in the world by the number of aircraft in 2022, the United States Air Force, United States Army, United States Navy, and United States Marine Corp hold the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 7th spots. I'd also argue the quality of those aircraft are on average much, much higher than anyone else's. In terms of navies, the most recent total tonnage numbers I can find are from 2014. The US has 3,415,895 tons. That's more than next nine biggest navies' tonnage combined! There are larger standing armies, but the US has the best equipped and trained fighting men and women, and it is undeniable the US is capable of global force projection in a way that dwarfs every other nation. \n\nAs for nuclear arsenals? While the Russians have more warheads, in light of recent revelations as to the state of corruption and military (un)readiness we have learned during the Ukraine War, I have less and less faith the Russian nuclear arsenal has been well-maintained since the fall of the Soviet Union. The other nuclear powers you mentioned are certainly regional powers, but they have one or two orders of magnitude less in their nuclear arsenal than the Americans do. Now none of them should be firing off those weapons, of course, but that doesn't mean they get to take the title of 'most powerful military in the world' when there is a clear front runner.\n\nI say again, with confidence, the president of the United States when holding the office is the single most powerful person on the face of the Earth. That has probably been true since Truman. It has certainly been true since the end of the Cold War.\n\nEdit: I got the numbers wrong on the airforces. 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 7th. My mistake.",

They finance some terrorists until they get too powerful, then they go and drown an entire region of the world in decades of violence and instability, achieve absolutely nothing, leave and claim to have won. \n\nThen only war the US ever won on their own was against themselves and even then they still have thousands of statues and flags of their enemies in their country today. The biggest achievement they claim was a worldwide collaboration with the Soviets arguably doing the majority of the work and the US coming in years late to claim the glory. \n\nSuccess isn't measured in numbers, it's measured in success.\n\nAlso the funny thing about nukes is, it doesn't fucking matter if you have fifteen or fifteen hundred.\n\nedit: I guess the only thing you have to answer is a downvote.

I'm not coming at this from a place of wounded pride. You're out of your tree if you think any country has the military advantage over the United States. Who are even the candidates? We're watching Russia's military reputation dissolve before our eyes. China hasn't actually had a shooting war in a couple of generations, so all their military training and thinking isn't based on combat experience at this point. They are a rising power and a formidable regional power, but they're not in a position to do anything to the United States short of attacking allies or a very lopsided nuclear exchange. India would struggle to handle a full-scale war with Pakistan at this point. Are you suggesting one of the other members of NATO has a stronger military than the United States? Laughable on its face.\n\nAs for the difference between fifteen and fifteen hundred nuclear weapons, there is an enormous difference. We wouldn't be comfortable, but if fifteen nukes went off, some version of civilization would survive. [We were doing atmospheric tests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCF7vPanrY&ab_channel=aConcernedHuman) pretty steadily as the nuclear powers of the 50s and 60s figured out the technology. The US can glass a continent and set off nuclear winter. North Korea can glass Tokyo, if it can hit it. That's the difference.",

Or even worse, completely avoid the question altogether and give you a mini lecture like you're a child\n\nThe algorithm there is also really sensitive (not sure how to word it).

It's like mocking Christianity by saying \"oh sure, his days-old corpse just *got up and walked out!*\" Yes. That is what they actually think.

Kids are having way more trouble in school kids are delayed in reading, kids are becoming signficantly more antisocial and not knowing how to act in social settings, their not caring about school, suicide is up, Domestic violence is up, child abuse is up, crime is way up, poverty is higher, supply chain crisis, oh no but desantis is bad because he no lockdown even know theirs clearly no downside to lockdowns right? If anything a lockdown is litterally the definition of fascism. Ur controlling people over irrational fear. Not to mention the u.s being so adamint against funding treatments like monoclonal antibodies. They kept lowering the amount of monoclonal antibodies to people to purely push vaccines.

Florida didnt have that much more if u take into account florida has 5 percent more people that are 65 and older. It's ridiculous. 20 percent of the population is seniors 65 and up in florida. Their the oldest state. For a state that had little to no lockdowns thats immeasurable especially considering florida and California are also pretty sunny throughout the year and the population of both states are pretty decently physically healthy. U can't deny the facts. We were in a panic and lock downs were good implentations at the beginning when we didnt know anything. Time and time again they lied to us. These are facts. They didn't promote healthy living all they did was promote a vaccine. They blocked monoclonal antibodies from being easily accessable by all states cuz they tried to push vaccines so hard its fucked up. Dont get me wrong im vaxxed mainly cuz my job at the time and who i was working with but then u look at the stats for my age group and the actual benefits from getting vaxxed and it's pointless. They lied and pushed it in your face so hard and they wonder why people dont trust the goverment. Fauci especially actually lied and has been lying since the 80s. I watched a whole documentary series on fauci and its gross how other scientists have litterally called him a sham and proved him wrong multiple times and hes still the head of the nih since the 80s and laughed when a reporter asked \"if its time to step down and let someone els have the job\"",

What to 65 percent wow.\n\nYou literally can't understand why having these 75% all needing medical services at the same time is categorically worse than spreading it out over two years by a multi-facted approach of policies such as masking, distancing, working from home, and vaccines that helped slow the spread to a manageable pace.  Far more people would have died if the healthcare system collapsed from being overworked.  You're too caught up in social media analysis to understand the reality of what that would even look like.  I saw morale collapse after months and months and it still hasn't returned.  I saw tons and tons of people quit.  I know of a hospital where the entire respiratory care team didn't show up to work because they were being overworked, understaffed and underpaid.  You take this healthcare system for granted.  You know nothing about it.  Praying that this stupidity coursing through society fades so if you're ever in need of medical assistance, we're there for you.",

Comparing the loss of gdp from the 2008 finacial crisis to the pandemic in california its worse of a downard bump. If you look at the recovery it almost seems too good to be true. Well it is. We're set to hit a massive resession and its gonna be horrible. Food shortages. Homelessness. No one purchasing anything and thats the collective buildup from lockdowns throughout and how we enforced lockdowns, totally crushing small buisnesses and leading to forclosures like nothing weve seen in a long long time. I think the democrats are happy about the loss of small buisnesses tho because corporate interests supercede all. Im not saying republicans dont fall to corporate interests which would be a lie but i definetly saw them defending small buisnesses more then any democrat thats for sure. Also i simply analyzed stats and u can't rebuttle them besides saying your a respiratory therapist in florida as if that makes you the all knowing person. Doctors disagree with eachother in belief. This isnt some unified 100 percent agreed apon thing that lockdowns are effective in totality and long term. I mean look at china, should we just give full power to the fed because everything will be a wittle bit safer shmoogems.",

Like if u just actually sat down and really dug through every talking point the left throws out its almost always extremely debunkable. Its like what Malcom x said. The democrats are wolves in sheep skin. He even said he favored republicans because at least they were straight to his face. We're set to see a huge culture shift in favor of republicans across the nation. Then the republicans are going to fail in key aspects and rinse and repeate.

This is seen in his rhetoric (routinely invokes Founding Fathers in a vague, endearing way and often references other American civil religion tropes) and his policy viewpoints (strong barriers to immigration, legal or illegal, and supports a privileged position of conservative Christianity in Florida public institutions.) \n\n**Militarist**. He wanted American troops back on the ground in Iraq and Syria to fight ISIS. Re-established the Florida State Guard to showcase state military power. Wants to expand military support for Israel. Rhetoric shows he would likely start a war with Iran.\n\n**Racist**. He laughed lightly at a suggestion Florida residents should \"bring back the hanging tree\". Has concentrated as much power against Florida's Black communities as possible via gerrymandering and refusing to allow ex-convicts the right to re-establish their enfranchisement rights, against the will of Florida voters. Called AOC \"wherever she's from\" to slight Puerto Ricans.\n\n**Authoritarian**. He supports increasing the American police state and exorbitant incarceration rates. Takes state action against critics of his policy. Believes the governor's office essentially can do whatever it wants, including draw new electoral districts. Enacts policies designed to chill the rights of Florida citizens, threatening them with lawsuits for not toeing a very strict rhetorical line designed to disallow children from questioning conservative Christianity.\n\nNationalist + militarist + racist + authoritarian = fascist. It's a simple definition. Progressives are not fascist, as they tend to be internationalist, pacifist or at least for reducing the size and influence of military, egalitarian and anti-racist, and in favor of a broad, universal view of human rights.",

I can confidently say this because a statement by itself cannot be confident. In other words, the speaker is both confident and incorrect.\n\nIn the phrase \"largely irrelevant\", the word \"largely\" is also an adverb enhancing the adjective \"irrelevant\", which is a substitute for the noun \"irrelevance\". I can confidently say *that* because nobody has ever said the statement, \"That has irrelevance.\" We only ever use the phrase, \"That is irrelevant.\" There is a syntactic difference where one phrase contains three parts of speech but the other functionally contains only two.\n\nAnother reason that I know that the syntactic structures of the phrases are different is because whatever \"it\" is cannot be \"large\" in that context. I mean, I guess it *could*, but that would be an extremely awkward usage of the word \"large\" that no one has ever used. \"Large\" is a qualitative modifier for the world \"irrelevant\", meaning \"mostly irrelevant\". If you stop using the word \"irrelevant\" to describe whatever \"it\" is, you cannot have a \"most it.\" You *can* have a \"large it\", but that would be changing the usage of the word \"large\" from a relative quantifier to a description of physical size.\n\nBut we didn't even need to have this discussion because the rhetoric being used undermines the rules. The speaker was deliberately being inflammatory. They didn't *care* about being correct.",

He ran the country, well he did a good job on the economy. But on the international stage he was mocked sometimes for his tweets but ultimately he used his words and tweets in a stumbling way that scared everyone and worked. He was unpredictable and that\u2019s what made him work for negotiations with North Korea. No one knew if he was going to pull back and decide to just obliterate them off the map or if he was going to play nice. He did the carrot or the stick and played with peoples lives in a dumb and scary way but it was effective. It was almost exactly what he\u2019s written out in his Art of the deal (only seen excerpts). I\u2019m not sure I ever want such an unpredictable president again.     \n\nAlso, revisionism? I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re referring to Trudeau who said that he liked chinas dictatorship unprompted or if you\u2019re talking about Trump who like everyone in a negotiation tries to make the other person feel like they\u2019re respected, in a higher (better) position and well complimented so they can get what they\u2019re asking for. Everyone does it, ever asked your mom to borrow a car or go out with friends to a concert overnight or for some other big thing? You always butter them up so you can get what you ask for.",

How can a man campeign without giving out coherent sentences, let alone make dicisions for the country.\n\n\nEverything needs to be just redone\n\nBut yeah, if I were trump Id be pretty pissed too\n\n\nEdit: ngl, never really posted opinions on the internet before this.\nIm just stating what I saw.

We shouldn't ignore the bad things either sides have done, but instead be willing to challenge the enjoyable lies we've been told and call out corruption in the people we've mistakenly supported. This mean turning to quantifiable statistics and falsifiable facts so we all see and agree what the problems are.\n\n The fact that you seem to believe the 2020 election was rigged is a red flag for me. Just take a step way back at look at it from the outside. It has been the single most scrutinized election in US history. Every official agency who's looked at it has said it was fair. Every third-party watchdog group who's looked at it has said it was fair. People who where paid to prove it was rigged have done their audits and said it was fair. The lawyers who went to court to prove it was rigged, admitted under oath it was fair. \n\nThere are the small scale examples of people unknowingly voting twice, or bad election officials acting independently to stuff some ballots. But if you look it up, that happens every election and it's never enough to change the outcome. \n\nThe only people in the country who claim it's fraudulent are the guy who has everything to gain from people believing that, and those who support him without question. It wasn't manipulated votes that made people loose faith in the system. It was the person they voted for telling them their votes where manipulated because he refused to admit defeat.\n\nThat's the type of thing that keeps us divided. If politicians can convince us to rally against injustices that don't exists, then they make us see each other as the enemies who are causing those injustices.",

We have a political party that is fairly fucking open about a lot of things they want. Like they are specifically targeting us becoming a theocracy. They want religious rule. They currently have the Supreme Court and can do things like gey rid of protections for abortions, which there has been talks of.\n\nThis would be where one of the other 3 pillars gets to step in and say \"You can't do these things unless we OK it!\" But what happens when the republcuans get that pillar? We don't elect Supreme Court justices. They have that locked down. Meanwhile, one of the other two is up for elections here soon. And then the presidential election will eventually happen. You don't think they will never get in charge? \n\nOr how about things like the 6th? Yes. It failed... but if it didnt... if they had more organization... Things might have ended up a little differently. \n\nI'm guessing people in Germany didn't start looking towards Hitler for genocide. He didn't really start advertising it. But within a few years, that's where he got to. \n\nNever say it can't happen here. It totally can. We have things set up to make it more difficult, sure. But this whole idea of things can never be that bad, when its been pretty much our entire history, means that things can start sliding backwards pretty quick.",
