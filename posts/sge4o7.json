Using a newer bill is even better if you have one, but certainly not a requirement.  \n>THIN PAPER MAKES A SHIT STRAIGHT EDGE EVEN IF FOLDED  \n>>You need to it be straight for less than an inch, it's fine.  \nOr you could just cut out the line with the pen tool, move it lower, and then use the clone stamp and smudge tools (or AI fill) to make sure that the space where the old red line was is invisible.

It makes a shit straight edge and your attack surface includes \"getting in trouble for lying to your boss\"\n\n>LOL just draw a straight line, they're not going make sure your shit is pixel perfect. You're really really blowing this out of proportion lol.\n\nIf your test looks sus I'd ask questions. For example, why is that line streaky and irregularly shaped?
