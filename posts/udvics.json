Let's say they founded Tesla and the very next day, before they put any work in, Musk bought them out.\n\nPeople who understand entrepreneurship and startups, understand that the founders often are only marginally responsible for a company's ultimate success, especially when they are bought out very early in the company's history.\n\nWhy would Musk owe the founders anything after he bought the company. He paid a fair price for a company that was losing money. Its founders had not figured out now to scale or capture market share and had no idea how to compete with Detroit.\n\nMusk is largely responsible for Tesla's success. And anybody harping on the poor founders is just looking for a grievance to have.\n\nWhy don't you focus on actual criticisms of the guy. Like how he is happy to censor free speech when it suits him or starts mean flame wars on Twitter because he's a narcissist.",

You (Bob) open a corner store (Bob's discount market) and decide after five years you want to sell it. Great. \n\nI then buy that store, rename it, \"Tim's Gourmet market\" and expand nationwide.

Some bosses and companies are absolute monsters. Some are genuinely good to work for. There is literally nobody, no matter how kind and decent, who would argue that Musk is doing something wrong by telling the Tesla origin story the way he does.

He's his own thing.\n\nHe does merge a little of the Jobs and Wozniak together with an engineering background and a sense of purpose to what the companies are trying to achieve.  Then he wraps that in some awkward product launches that he never quite feels comfortable with.\n\nSpaceX is not solely Elon by any stretch of the imagination, but his role in pushing a vision of multi-planetary life and reusable rockets to success via smart engineering and stretch targets.  A lot of smart people thought that reusable rockets were just not possible.  Now is Elon writing firmware and drawing rocket motors? No.  Does he have a reasonable understanding of the tech behind things to draw some good conclusions about what's possible.  Seems like he does.  He hires really smart people.  Manages them in some good and some bad ways.  But so far shown that the reusability is a solid concept.  Starship is super exciting too.\n\nTo me a Telsa is a car made by IT people and not mechanics incorporating tech into a car.  As an IT person watching people try and do the later, there's boundless potential for smart IT people to use tech advancements in other areas rather than the other way around.\n\nIf nothing else Tesla, is pushing manufacturers to keep up with their rate of electric car progress, rather than leaving GM, Ford, Fiat, VW, Toyota etc to get around to doing it and taking massive risk in the process.\n\nCreating an expensive luxury electric roadster first and making  more boring cheaper versions later is a very smart move that kept them afloat.  Whether that was Elon or not I don't know.  I'd rather a Roadster than a Leaf or a Volt.  Getting rich people to buy perceived \"cool\" stuff is a great way to keep a company afloat.  \n\nYou do need a smart, rich guy to invest in stuff like this.  Being one step away from super villian is may come back to bite humanity later.  Taking away his Twitter rather than letting him buy the whole damn thing is definitely going to continue to be bad PR wise.\n\nHe's not self made, but he is a guy with vision, with enough cash to make stuff happen.  He did almost bankrupt himself with Telsa and SpaceX, but I've done the same thing paying my electric bills and rent at the same time.\n\nSpaceX might be a pretty awful pressure cooker of a place to work, but I'm not sure Boeing or Lockheed Martin are trouble free either.  So bit hard to pick one guy and blame him for everything when you compare Falcon9 to SLS or Blue Origin.\n\nSo in conclusion Elon is neither all bad or all good.  Everyone else is just as bad or worse, just different ways and twitter is never going to stop being a cesspool of \"free speech\".  Elon's wife should take away his twitter account, except his last wife was even more insane than he is.\n\nGwynne Shotwell's autobiography is probably going to be a good read one day.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk",

This is some next level shit right here. So now you're having a go at him because he wanted to build something himself rather than just be a money man? I thought you didn't like him just being a money man? Stick to one argument ffs hahaha\n\n>This is the same guy who tried to get majority stake in Twitter and when they said no just bought Twitter. He cares way more about fame. Him \"thanking\" his heads as a gesture occasionally doesn't change that.\n\nWhat are you even talking about here? He *did* become majority shareholder. What happened was that initially they rejected his offer to buy the company, but then they reconsidered and accepted.\n\n>If this is how you prove you're not a fan boy by the way? Bad job. Only a fanboy would go \"BUT HE THANKED HIS ENGINEERS THAT ONE TIME\".\n\nAre you 12? Serious question. I didn't say he \"thanked his engineers once\", I said he is *always* *congratulating* his teams. Even a 12 year old should know what the words congratulate and always means.\n\n>I'm not gonna engage with the whataboutism at all.

A venture capitalist doesn\u2019t become CEO. Elon has been running Tesla and is the reason for why it is where it is today. Not because he invested in it and let other people run it. He is the one running it. He created a website that was merged with Confinity that turned into PayPal. And before that he created a software company Zip2 in college that he sold for 300 million. He also cofounded solar city, openAI, and neurolink and founded the Boring company. Not trying to hop on the Elon bandwagon but in no way is he a venture capitalist and it takes a 2 minute google search to realize that. you gotta give credit where credit is due",

Then launch a constellation of satellites so the shitty monopolies and governments can no longer control the internet and prices.

He has plenty of legitimate accomplishments but for some reason that\u2019s not enough, he has to pretend he invented the EV or online payments or satellite internet. He talks about his Las Vegas tunnels like they\u2019re amazing and innovative when they\u2019re anything but. In fact those tunnels are the best evidence that Elon\u2019s main skill is in sales and marketing because how the hell did he convince Las Vegas to fund him? People don\u2019t like bullshitters or narcissists, especially ones that veer out of their \u201clane\u201d and start going off about how the far left has hijacked the Democratic Party when the dude thinks \u201cfar left\u201d means paying taxes. Or who brags/complains about paying $5B in taxes when his net worth increased by $100B that year.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the false myths Elon keeps perpetuating about his \u201chumble upbringings\u201d which are anything but. Dude has never not been extremely rich a day in his life.\n\nI could keep going. My state, California, saved his company during hard times. Our subsidies were Teslas entire operating margin for years. Then COVID-19 happens and uses it as an excuse to move to Texas to dodge taxes, and talks crap about our state as if we didn\u2019t play a huge role in his success.",

His father invested a decent amount, but was only around 10% of the total for the angel round. He likely could have invested without the share in the mine.\n\nI hate that this lie is passed around so much. There are so many valid reasons to hate Elon (like how he treats his employees, the stupid stuff he says, and the fact that he is a billionaire). Making up something else just makes you look bad and distracts from actual solutions (like helping workers form unions or instituting a wealth tax).",

People give a shit about turning ideas into things. That's what investors look for when they invest their money into startups. \n\nAnd yeah, of course you have advantages if you are rich. That's true in every type of economy. You think little guys don't get crushed by the rich in communist china or socialist Venezuela? Grow up, that's a fact of life. \n\nCapitalism still provides the most social mobility for people who work hard, people who are motivated to turn their ideas into action. You don't have to be a millionaire to have a startup, you just need a work ethic, a good idea, and a business plan. If you have none of that, then you're probably going to complain about [insert your country's economic structure].",

Point is though, the real effort is actually execution, if you've got a good idea the funding will come because there's toks of angel investors looking for the next big thing.

There's only so many people with that kind of money, and they don't vacation on the moon regularly. Once those initial people with the interest and the money to buy a ticket have been to space, it's over. That seems like a terrible business plan for a tourist company. If that were SpaceX's focus they'd try to make it cheaper (both for customers and themselves). It could happen in the future, once they have the tech to make this cost several thousands instead of millions it can become a space tourism company. But I doubt if Elon has that tech he's going to use it to show rich kids Mars from up close, asteroid mining and that sort stuff is way more likely.",

Self driving cars two years off in 2014/16/18 (buy a Tesla and when the update goes live you'll make 30,000 a year using it as a robotaxi). Electric trucks that are more efficient than rail, fully functional in 2017 and in production 2019 (pre order now!). The las Vegas loop. The solar tiles that were fully operational and powering the houses at the presentation. All of that was lies. Not mistaken estimates. Not aspirational. They were lies he told to get funding and drive share increases. Just like his Tesla bot going into production next year is a lie.\n\nAgain, failure is not the issue, his lying is. He makes wildly outrageous promises, then hires talented people and works them to death to produce his lie. Which they invariably cannot, because anyone with an ounce of expertise in the industry knows they're not possible. Just because he has a couple of successes within all that dishonest failure, doesn't mean it's suddenly all okay.\n\nWe shouldn't reward the 'fake it until you make it' ethos just because sometimes you kinda make it a little bit.",

Let\u2019s say I build a computer component that is revolutionary to how computers will work in the future, get a patent, but I don\u2019t implement it well, the whole thing hasn\u2019t taken off and it doesn\u2019t look like I\u2019ll get far so I sell my company off to another group or half own it in this instance and the guy I\u2019m now sharing this company with steps in and revolutionizes this computer part and now we have a real product. The guy that helped me become successful didn\u2019t invent the part, but does he get no credit for it becoming a success? He found a way to make it work just like Elon did with Tesla, and PayPal. Companies at that level now a days are not self made. They are a result of corporation buyout up and down the chart with the inventor usually receiving a large sum for the invention of the idea. Why are Elon\u2019s accomplishments so shot down? Another thing to note was that he was the lead engineer on the first Tesla Roadster  which is the vehicle that made Tesla what it is today. He also is very involved in his companies problem solving and is committed whole heartedly to what he believes. I just don\u2019t see what\u2019s so wrong with himself doing what he does",

Founder [means to establish an organisation](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/founder). To establish means to start an organisation that will continue for a long time. That is exactly what Musk did when he put in almost the complete first funding round 6 months after the name was incorporated.",

Tesla was not doing that at the time Musk joined. So you could argue that Tesla was not a company. That is the reason why Musk could be seen as a founder.

People *like* the perks and benefits as well as the environment, but that doesn't mean they're not being unfairly treated. Here's a review right out of Glassdoor. This is one of the *many* complaints at Apple.\n\n>ZERO ZERO ZERO work/life balance. Execs have been saying for YEARS that they understand and will make it better. But in actuality, it gets worse every year! It is obviously top management LIP SERVICE because if they meant it, they could fix it tomorrow. They have hundreds of BILLIONS in the bank. If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance, they could bring aboard the right number of folks to make that issue dissolve. Sick of hearing the lies. Just don't lie about wanting to fix it, when they clearly DON'T care\n\n\"Yeah.\" I heard you said. \"That's what happens when you work for the biggest company in the world.\"\n\nWhen companies do not give employees the resources they need to lead a positive life at home and at work, their health deteriorates and they become burn out. That leads to a horde of health issues. [https://www.ijrhss.org/pdf/v2-i12/2.pdf](https://www.ijrhss.org/pdf/v2-i12/2.pdf)\n\nThis is the problem here. You can get a lot of money, but by the end you end up with: \"depression, alcohol and drug abuse, marital and financial problems, compulsive eating disorders, and employee burnout\", you're doing something wrong.\n\n>Most people work their whole career trying to get into companies like these. \n\nNever said anything about that. It's industry truth. What I'm *saying*, which you miss completely, is that employees' work environment could be 100% better than it is right now.\n\n>If you think working at companies like that is crap it sounds like you just don't want to work.\n\nOh fuck off with that shit and get off your high horse. I work in the tech sector. The fact that I disagree with industry policies do not mean I don't want to work.",

Prooving that private companies can indeed make it work in a sector that was previously mostly funded and kept alive by the US government / other governments\n\n2. Making it plausible to reuse (more accurately refurbishing) first stage of a rocket (the biggest part of the rocket). Which has in turn made a SpaceX launch for low earth orbit a lot cheaper. By like a margin of 8-10 times cheaper.\n\nThere is only really a single other private company who has made a functioning commercial rocket so far, and that is Rocket Lab. Though their rocket is way smaller (300 kgs to low earth orbit whereas falcon 9 is in the 15000 kgs range) and rocket lab is to conduct their first attempt at their reuse plan in like 3 hours. Just to put it into context.\n\nOther entities:\n\nULA (Boeing/Lockheed) is mainly funded by the US,\n\nArianespace is mainly funded by the EU.\n\nRoscosmos is mainly funded by Russia\n\nCNSA is mainly funded by China\n\nISRO is mainly funded by India\n\nBlue Origin hasnt actually achieved orbital class yet",

Kids who are from money, kids who are related to people with money, and kids who are basically getting bankrolled to do anything and everything they want and play in the film entertainment industry.\n\nI had to work my ass off as a production assistant, gaffer, grip, and everything below the line up to second unit director.

They knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody. \n\nI started doing research into directors, because that's my major, and it turns out that the majority of the directors who do the movies you love so much are also trust fund kids. Bank rolled by rich individuals they know. These individuals are able to get there momentum going, meaning they're able to produce content that gets them future jobs so they can produce more content so they can get future jobs.\n\nWhen you can just come in and pay for it all, have everyone else do you work and then you get established so you can turn around and have everyone else do it all for you so you get more established?\n\nThat's not working from the bottom to the top, That's landing on The roof using a helicopter and enjoying the penthouse.\n\nThat's what a lot of our entrepreneurs today are, rich kids who knows somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody. Individuals born with silver spoons in their mouths, Bank rolled by everyone to do anything they want. \n\nSuccess is guaranteed.\n\nWe should be emulating people who work from the bottom and make our way to the top not people who are already at the top keeping themselves at the top.\n\nSorry for the rant.",

He's a shrewd business person who has gotten insanely wealthy by utilizing other people's inventions and exploiting the labor of others.",

The plan they presented would give *aid* to *40 million* people *in 2022*\n\nOf course that's not a bad thing.

Not to mention, the amount of Tesla's sold compared to the amount of cars sold is hilarious. Tesla's barely make a dent in the market and a all percentage of upper middle class people driving 1 Tesla isn't gonna save the planet. \n\nSo yes, Tesla is worth a lot, but it shouldn't be because it's not ground breaking. Elon didn't found it or progress the science, it already existed. However, the best thing Elon did was have his name and clout attached to the company and fanboys pooled in to fund it. It was a classic crypto \"to the moon\" scheme that also happened to help the economy. Tesla stocks will continue to fall over time as other car companies, that actually have ways of handling recalls, move to electric vehicles and Tesla just becomes the overpriced name brand car that quickly falls behind the overall technology of the market. \n\nAnd for my last argument. I'd like to ask you to imagine what would happen if anyone else purchased Tesla. Hypothetically, do you think Tesla would crash without Elon's name or do you think the company is strong enough to sustain it's stock prices? I believe it would crash without elon, and that's not a good thing when the guy it needs isn't even educated enough to explain anything about his cars.",

The infrastructural shift to climate change is going to require as much entrepreneurship as possible for more sustainable and affordable products and Tesla was a big part of this and its success pressed the hands more of companies like Ford to actually start developing electric cars. It's weird to base judgments off of loose assumptions and unwarranted comparisons. Nobody said Tesla was going to just fix the world.

Could care less about that tbh cause it doesn't make a difference. They were extremely overjoyed but they're now just a luxury car that disabled your seat adjustments if you make too many, real story btw lol. Tesla seat motors are faulty and kept breaking so they just disabled them for 5 minutes if you used it too much. It's funny more than anything. \n\nRegardless, Tesla is still and inflated company and electric vehicles are becoming more available. Primary reason I think companies stay away from them for as long as possible is the reliance on oil companies. Since Tesla is a tech company and not a car manufacturer, it's not in bed with big oil. \n\nAt the end of the day, musk likes attention and gloating about his ideas, but those ideas are poorly implemented and he isn't designing them, just taking the credit. He's the newest Steve jobs.",

He didn't found Paypal, he didn't found Tesla. What you're doing is *characterizing* or *contextualizing* facts, which is fine\u2014but it doesn't change the underlying fact being characterized/contextualized.\n\nThe original post frames these entities as originating from Elon Musk's personal motivations. That's just not accurate. That he played a large part in making Paypal successful, or steered (pun... intended?) Tesla toward its success is not the original framing.",

I'm broke AF and the same goes for me. Giving schools more money doesn't replace the unmotivated teachers who couldn't get a job at a better place.\n\nI'm not saying we shouldn't pursue fixing these problems through more robust societal cooperation cause we should. I'm just saying that redistribution of large amounts of wealth is such an inefficient use of resources that it ends up being worse than wasteful, it can make the problems worse.",

I think that's generally a very unstable means to get wealth. Contrary to what people say, people flux in and out of wealth in this society. It isn't the same individual people holding the same amount of wealth, it's just the same proportion of people. I think the heavily exploitive ones generally end up moving out of the 1% without any external intervention.",

All propoganda effects like 99% of the people it touches and it's probably impossible for yourself to know exactly how much you've been tainted.\n\nMy personal take on it comes from a couple things: \n\na) knowing quite a few people in the 1% (but I live paycheck to paycheck) and to put it lightly their top traits are not greedyness/materialism. They're incredibly hard workers and they're driven by what endeavours they can take on that would be the most meaningful for them.\n\nb) how effectively society functions given what we ask it to do within immutable parameters like malevolent desire for power or the fact that high degrees of inequitable distribution have existed in every plant, animal, human 'society' since eons before our species but there's less of it now across the globe than any other time in history ANYWHERE.\n\n\nI think we run the huge risk of throwing the baby out of the bath, or the drinking water with the jugs. Especially when you turn to the government which has even less accountability and more corruption. Not to underplay the unfortunate amount of exploitation and lack of accountability in the top 1/100th of 1%, it's alot. But giant Bureaucracies are not the primary mechanisms for social evolution and that's a dangerous road to go down on my opinion.",

Literally billions of dollars go into charities, governments, nonprofits, organizations, etc... and there is a real, real, real problem of the mismanagement of budgeting and money that really helps to de-legitimize them. I work with a woman from Nigeria who oversees organizational budgeting for the benefit of local villages -- food, water, clothing, energy, what have you -- and she remarked passionately in a meeting once about how much money is wasted. Just because you give someone else all your money doesn't mean they're going to spend it well. Secondly where is all his money going into now? Investments. His money is directly contributing to the wealth of other companies that then are able to support their workers and stay afloat. A more valid criticism is less the fact that he has a lot of money and more so the fact that he could be spending it in his own initiatives to help solve world problems. The thing is is that we don't have the right to assume what others are to do with their lives, we don't know what they are going to do with their lives, and we often forget what they are already focusing on. He's already trying to manage and maintain essential businesses, mainly Tesla which includes Tesla solar that are incredibly important for the societal shift to sustainability. We need entrepreneurs to make greener, more sustainable products and that's what he's doing and he's trying to make it cheaper.",

They aren't the only electric car company and the reasons behind the patents are understandable from a business perspective.

It's an essential part of the equation. Why does it matter that there *his?* Who else should they be? Do you really think it makes sense to just run a business and then go bankrupt? In fact having MORE players in competition helps the consumer more. You can't argue that he doesn't care about the environment based on arguable positions.

I feel like you're imposing a false image and comparison on him which is inherently invalid. He's not deciding anything for humanity. He's simply engaging with it out of his own personal interest. He's not forcing anyone to do anything there.

Sure he's wealthy, but I don't think you have the right (respectfully) to act like the role of CEO is useless and easy. It's not and he had to work incredibly hard to get to that position. Additionally he helped design and engineer the products. Just because people work for him doesn't mean they do ALL the work. Yes he's one person but there's a reason why CEO's exist. It's nonsensical to put it up as if he's supposed to be sweeping the floors, assembling the pieces, and whatever else. I can understand distaste for that kind of wealth but I'm not sure I would say that a billionaire adds next to nothing to society. Economically, it's just not true and economics is simply the subject that studies how you get food on the table, products in your house, your house itself, and the system by which you can afford so many luxuries. As much as we can sit around and moan about the wealth others have we can at least acknowledge that if it weren't for the businesses they are in charge of and of which success is dependent on their direction and performance as well as their employees, then many people wouldn't have their jobs, wouldn't have their lives. Additionally his wealth is in investments, which means that his money is directly funding other businesses which support the lives of more people. As much as you can disagree fundamentally with the system itself, you can at least see the utility of the positions possible and how they can contribute to how other people get food on the table and material security.",

He sold 5 billion dollars worth of shares to charities among other things. I feel with you the problems of the world and our country, but we can't simply judge wealthy people for them not being instantly solved. We have to dig deeper into structural solutions similar to what you say in the first paragraph on how to influence (for me preferably more voluntarily than forcibly) wealthy and influential people to use their resources for good while acknowledging how difficult it is to solve enormous problems. You can't just throw money at something and expect it to go swell. Humanity's problems are also ***not*** immediately solvable from what I can tell. They require immense infrastructural change that will take decades, cultural awareness that will take time to seep in, better leadership to develop in our politics, and a more intelligent, open-minded, and considerate atmosphere for political discourse. I see the problems and I feel with you, where I detach is (not that I'm saying you do this but it is very much observable) unproductively judging people I don't know and feeling my own moral high ground related to subjects that are often much more complicated than I might immediately suspect and getting mad at rich people for not having been exposed to the same considerations as I have. The most productive thing to do is to shut up about other people and to look at what structural change can we implement in order to get people to be more considerate and collective and how we can find the right leadership to manage projects that will take time and consideration to execute and see results.",

The best example is Mackenzie Scott, formally Bezos, who has given away _billions_ of dollars to specific charities and is still wealthier than when she divorced Jeff. Money makes money and hoarding it does nothing but place the burden of tax of the crippled middle and lower class. \n\nThese are all things that America used to do; income tax for the ultra-wealthy was something that people used to be proud of, protecting the middle class and providing whatever aid possible to the lower class is a fundamental part of the American dream. \n\nI'm not saying for a moment suggesting that we should hang the billionaires or anything but the wealth divide in America is greater than before the French Revolution and they didn't shift their society with political debate.",

Do you really think that with the snap of fingers and throwing money at something will immediately improve the world? First off, you have to think infrastructurally. The timeliness absolutely depends less on people with money and their supposed refusal to help and more on the actual substance of what the change looks like. You can't just build Nuclear power plants and solar plants in days, you can't just spur innovation for solar panel industrialization for consumption and other sustainable innovation and have electric products flood the markets for consumerism immediately, you can't just convince everyone on Earth to live simpler and less consumptive lives, you can't just convince everyone to immediately care and to relinquish their fossil fuels. A huge part of this equation isn't simply wealth, it's innovation and development which are the backbones of entrepreneurship and is where Elon resides. We need entrepreneurs to make products that are more affordable for consumers so that we can easily and more affordably convert to greener energy SOURCES and not just products because even if you have electric products, where is all that energy going to come from? We simply don't have the infrastructure for it and it certainly isn't known to us yet what is the perfect plan and it certainly isn't ready yet. Secondly, I sincerely believe that I don't have the right to judge others for what they do because they weren't exposed to the same stimuli and raised by the same values as I was. If we end off the equation at Elon Musk and hating him for not thinking like how we think, then nothing gets done. If we ask why Elon Musk thinks that way and then we say, hey, what can do with our education policy, what cultural and media enterprises can be done to get people to think more collectively and to spread the message of the Gospel of Wealth? Thirdly, I said previously that their wealth isn't \"hoarded.\" It's not sitting in a vault, it's being brewed BACK into the economy and back into businesses to keep them afloat and therefore to make sure that people have the wealth to pay for their meals and their houses. Lastly, I completely relate to your sentiment about addressing income inequality, strengthening the middle class and lower class, etc... I just think that the most productive ways to do this is by thinking structurally. Your third paragraph produces some ideas that ought to be reconsidered for policy I'd say.",

We get fed garbage about how \"we must all do our part to stop global warming\" by switching to paper straws that melt in our drinks and turning off lights when we leave a room as if it makes any difference. Meanwhile, hyper-capitalist, corporate monsters who show open contempt for human life dump insane amounts of poison and mutagens into the environment and everyone shrugs, saying \"oh well, what can you do.\" Elon Musk wanted to have more money, so he started a company that manages payments over the internet. That made him rich, so he thought about the best way to become even more rich and came up with electric cars because it was an unexplored niche at the time. He did the space stuff because he wanted even more money and it was a growth industry at the time. He's not special, he's just a greedy capitalist like all the rest. The only difference is that he's much better at marketing.",

Yeah he doesn't seem to be a very nice person, and no, he didn't start from nothing, but he's still a very skilled business man.\n\nHe absolutely did found SpaceX. No doubt it about it.\n\nFor Tesla he was the first investor and 3rd person in the company, a couple of months after the company was officially started. He then radically changed the focus of the company and brought in more investors. He's absolutely a co-founder in any meaningful sense of the word.\n\nFor paypal it's a bit more complicated. He didn't found paypal. But he founded X.com which ended up merging with Confinity, which Elon heading the merged company, and later rebranding to paypal. So he started one of the two constituent companies. Again, I think that reasonably makes him one of the founders of paypal.\n\nThere's plenty of good reasons to criticize Musk.

It means I can acknowledge his success when they are accurately accounted for and can criticize him for the ways in which I think his success is selfish. But for the simps, anything other than godlike worship is seen as hating or jealousy. \n\nSo it's not Musk I object to, it's the sycophantic simps who demand we all worship him like a god and do so by awarding him undue credit for things he didn't actually do.",

These talents are what brought him success. He recognized the need for online financial service when the internet was still considered a fad and started X.com, he then saw the potential that confinity.com had and instead  of competing with them chose to merge and create PayPal. 2 years after this in 2002 he founded SpaceX and began the long road to the innovations they have achieved(achievements being the increased performance of cheaper liquid fuel and the design of reusable rocket stages) by building a remarkable team and brought in billions in funding needed to fund a project that would take nearly 15 years before it started generating revenue(just getting the investment funding he did for SpaceX is a true achievement when you consider he convinced greedy investors to provide him money for a project they would not see any return on for over a decade).He then went on in 2004 to provide 95% of the stage 1 funding for Tesla Motors which was started less then a year prior by 2 engineers who had no experience building motors or cars and recognized the potential of the then untested new motor and battery designs, Tesla Motors may very well not exist if it was not for his support and the EV and solar industry not have advanved nearly as much as it has without Tesla Motors. His third project is his least successful but still holds potential in the future if they can reduce production costs and that is SolarCity with the solar roof tiles, and he has recognized his mistake in this area as he was trying to sell a marginally better product into an already established solar panel market which is nearly impossible. While he may not of had a physical hand in the creation of the technology for PayPal and Tesla it was still his ability to see the potential of these products when they were still very much unproven and built SpaceX into the first true privately owned space company.",
