Keywords: **AND/OR.** My statement was precise (unlike your reading comprehension, which is quite lacking, clearly!) and has taken into account the unclear object of your original comment.  \nNow, with your other reply to mine you clarified that you were talking about OP's queer identity, so that means that your original comment was indeed queerphobic (either panphobic, transphobic, or both depending on which one of OP's queer identities bothers you), but before reading your comment I had no way of knowing which one of OP's identities was the object of your scorn, and as I already said, I did take into account that unclarity with my wording, so my statement was fully correct and appropriate.  \n\n\nDo you understand it better now, or do I have to draw you a picture??",

Idk your life.) while still covering all the possibilities.  \n**Now** that you explained that your comment was referring to OP's queer identities, **it is clear to me that you were in facts queerphobic** (you saying that you aren't means **nothing,** since everything else you said on the subject proves that you are).  \nIs it finally clear now or are we still not getting it?\n\nAnd **no**, you do not get to decide when we're done: you said something queerphobic, and this is the consequence of your own action. If you don't like the consequence then I suggest you to stick to non-discriminating roasting, next time, but now you gotta suck it up.  \nAnd while we're at it I also suggest you to avoid trying to teach to queer and disabled people what the words \"queerphobia\" and \"ableism\" mean.

No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us. And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God\u2019s love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow \u2014 not even the powers of hell can separate us from God\u2019s love. No power in the sky above or in the earth below \u2014 indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
