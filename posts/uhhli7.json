You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans?

Then when they eventually stop paying again, now you are getting less food assistance or less healthcare. We cannot count on the courts to enforce shit, because many of them already don\u2019t. This is a war on women and the same courts that will deny is bodily autonomy will also deny us consistent child support. \n\nThe system already fails us. Child support and abortion are two separate issues. We cannot let these conservative fucks dictate what we do with our own bodies. It will not end at abortion. The men running for governor in Michigan already said they will seek to make contraception illegal for married women. We are nothing more than incubators to them.",

He was a good enough liar to convince the court and even though they ordered him to pay, they rarely saw a nickle from him.\n\nA co-worker I used to work with spent all of his time bitching about his \"whore\" of an ex-wife and how he shouldn't have to pay child support to someone who cheated on him. He never paid and then he bitched about the IRS garnishing his wages as if it wasn't his own fault for not paying.\n\nI've met, known, and worked with men like this. They would rather starve than give their ex-wife and child any kind of support. You're fortunate that yours does.",
