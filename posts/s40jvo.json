  "text": "TIFU by flashing my boyfriend\nMy boyfriend and I are staying at his aunt\u2019s beach house for the week along with his mom and daughter. We all went to the beach yesterday and when we got back his mom went to go shower his daughter, I was sitting in a chair opposite the dining room table, and he was at the table checking emails.\n\nI got his attention and jokingly pulled one boob out of my bathing suit top which is pretty normal for our relationship and didn\u2019t realize his mom had come out of the bathroom and was almost directly next to me. She made a shocked face, he started cracking up, and I wanted to die. Needless to say, I won\u2019t be flashing him with anyone around jokingly or not for a very long time.\n\nTL;DR flashed my boyfriend one boob for a laugh and accidentally flashed his mom as well\n\nETA: just wanted to say thank you guys for the awards, I didn\u2019t know everyone would get such a kick out of my one boob wonder.",

She thought somehow that my gf had been kidnapped and was being forced to take photos to terrorize her mom. She made my gf delete the texts from the chat ,from the phone,from the cloud cause she was afraid someone would somehow see it.\n\nMy gf was horrified obviously but once she told me I thought it was hilarious after the fact",

The guys next to me snickered and were high fiving me, congratulating me on having access to such nice boobs. We get to the ramp and just as I'm about to board, we are told the flight has been cancelled due to engine issues. I turn around to walk back and she is just standing at the window, looking absolutely defeated. The same guys walked passed her and complimented her boobs. I had a great laugh, she did not.\n\nEdit: edited for poor grammar",

Lived in a town where no one locked their doors, and it was about 7am so no drama. I suddenly hear a car in the driveway and the unmistakeable sound of an old style hand brake being applied, followed by a car door slamming. No idea who it was so leapt up and ran to the bedroom to get my robe. Hear a loud knock. I yell \"Coming!\" He heard \"Come in!\" And opened the door to me with one arm in my robe and a full frontal view. He was coming to tell us his baby had been born overnight. They played cricket that day and batted together. Every time they had a mid pitch conference I cringed. And Aussies being Aussies the entire team commented on him getting to see my boss during the course of the game.",

It's a great opportunity to see cultural history in a nutshell, as all the puritanical-based arguments flood out.\n\nLike, imagine hunters and gatherers thinking that it's gross for women to show their boobs. This sort of natural contextual contrast illuminates how silly we are for having any alternative response to nudity.\n\nSociety doesn't just magically create valid reasons for why nudity seems gross. But, some of the more regressive societies surely infect the idea into culture that it is. You got the infection, mate.\n\nThe more you introspect on why you think that, the fewer reasons you'll find to support it. You clearly didn't come to that opinion by good logic, you came to it by associating with culture. That's not the best way to form opinions.\n\nBut, hey, it's evolutionary to fit in with the crowd. At least your survival technique is viable, eh?",

The drive for sex, the desire for sex, the need for sex. It's the common denominator that unites (almost) everyone and sells everything. \n\nWhen you're indoctrinated like this from day one, you don't ever think to consider that there might be something *different* about yourself. You automatically think there must be something *wrong* with you. So I spent a decade trying to \"fix\" my asexuality. It didn't work. Almost killed me actually, and traumatized the hell out of me. I'm in therapy now dealing with the consequences. \n\nAnd just because a person is asexual doesn't mean that the physical act of sex can't be \"enjoyable\". My nervous system works the same way yours does. I don't experience sexual attraction to other people, and at 34 I'm finally comfortable just existing as I am instead of trying to prove something to myself or to other people who have a fundamentally different life experience than I do.",

Does that mean you can't look at someone and think they are pretty/handsome/cute/ugly? Somebody flashing you doesn't cause any feelings? \n\nIs it the same for fashion? architecture? cars? etc.?

She swore never to do that ever again as that had been the first time she'd ever done that. But after dinner and a bit of drinking, I ended up getting laid for the first time. That was a good trip.\n\nANOTHER EDIT: Haha, oops. Didn\u2019t expect this to blow up this much.",

This just reminded me of something similar that happened to me, though not sexual.\n\nMy boyfriend was at his parents' house, and he was showing them, his brother, and his aunt and uncle something from his phone and had his phone casted to the TV for all to see. I had been messaging him and he didn't warn me, so I sent something along the lines of \"I'm so fucking high - I need to lay down for a bit.\"\n\nWeed had been a point of contention in their house for a while, since in their culture, it's viewed just as bad as other hardcore drugs, and he had been caught with weed as a teenager, so his parents were quite upset and his mom wanted him to stay with her to \"get clean\" and all this nonsense.",

Apparently several people with the condition have (with medical intervention) given live births, but obviously outright not having a vagina would make that less likely. It's notable that this is an old story from a (to many internet-goers) faraway location, so some exaggeration may have happened, but sperm **can** survive in acidic environments and for days at a time, and her being only 15 means that only having one or two periods is plausible. It's definitely peculiar, but I suppose no more peculiar than that one soldier with the eating disorder who supposedly ate someone's baby, whose Wikipedia article reads like a creepypasta.\n\n( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarrare) )",

On the way back to his dorm I proceeded to puke inside another building. I made it to the toilets but a little got on my top. There was no one else in the public area so I took off my top - he was so worried someone would see me so he gave me the shirt off his back (literally) and was walking me back when\u2026 we ran into a few of his upperclassmen friends. \n\nYou can imagine their faces. We laughed a lot but it sobered me up real quick.",
