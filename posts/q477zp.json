I don\u2019t recall any of those pieces of shit so much as getting their guns confiscated. \n\nGun culture in The US is white gun culture. The second it isn\u2019t Republicans start passing gun control laws and cops are killing law abiding gun owners on sight (see Gov. Reagan\u2019s response to Black Panthers, or Philando Castile)\n\nFrankly, the only way I see conservatives coming to the table to pass reasonable gun reform is if gun ownership among minorities and progressives shoots through the roof and a lefty gun culture takes root. If democratic socialist and/or Black/Latino/Asian/LGBTQ+ gun clubs start cropping up and flooding ranges nationwide republican politicians might change their tune. \n\nPersonally I\u2019m all for gun control, but seeing how meaningful reform is a pipe dream, how this government seems incapable of holding right wing white nationalist terrorists to account on a systemic level, I don\u2019t blame people on the left for tooling the fuck up. January 6 and the past 5 years have convinced me these fascists are gearing up for genocide. Right wingers are increasing convinced they\u2019re facing an existential crisis and nazi arguments used to justify genocide are now mainstream Republican ideology. Fuck this.",

The defense isn't trying to argue that he should be able to get away with murder because of these hunting laws, but if they want to claim it was self-defense they have to demonstrate that he had some legal right to own that weapon.\n\nI'm not trying to defend him, to be clear.

Please don't feed into the \"scary black rifle\" fear mongering. \n\nHunting usually has a magazine capacity limit or other restrictions that tend to make people lean towards bolt action or single fire.\n\nA 30 round mag (standard offering on an AR) and a 75rd drum have literally 0 effect on how the gun operates, they simply provide capacity. You can get a drum mag for a Glock too, and it's the same thing, only adds capacity but not any additional functionality",
