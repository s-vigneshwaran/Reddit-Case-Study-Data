No situation is static and unchangeable, no cost is necessary, so long as you're willing to do what it takes to get yourself out of a bad life.  If you cling to such meaningless shit as \"but I neeeeeeeeed a car\", you will forever remain poor.\n\nOf course, if you're financially well off enough to have a reasonable nice car in the first place, you'll remain that financially well off enough too, but generally those sorts of people are quite happy with their situation, so the economic immobility isn't much of a worry.\n\n> millions of poor Americans\n\nIt's almost unbelieveable that millions of Americans could be stubborn, stupid, and lack self-control.  Of course by \"almost\" I mean \"not at all\".",

And everyone who's ever owned a home knows it.\n\nSo the mortgage payment will be about $2,300/mo. Every month. All rolled into one bill. And you know who else knows that? Your loan officer, who will tell you with your shitty DTI ratio that the best you can afford is a $230k house, and you'll be lucky if underwriting allows even that. This is also why the rent zestimate there is $2,400/mo. Did you really think landlords were pulling 34% annual ROI off zero down mortgages? Hahaha.",

If you don\u2019t work for someone else, you have to make your own tax payments.

Billionaires and the rest of the wealthy increased their wealth by a huge amount. School teachers are turning to OnlyFans to afford rent and classroom supplies. Children are going hungry all over the country. The economy should serve the people, but we are made to serve the economy instead.  \n\nA great example of this is my dad, who made less than $100k a year when working, and now subsists on disability/social security, voted for Trump twice because \u201cgood for the economy.\u201d The Dow being up doesn\u2019t help my dad, yet he\u2019s been brainwashed into believing it.  \n\nWe need to get our fucking priorities straight and start using all this wealth that\u2019s floating around to help the people that desperately need it. Imagine what this country would look like in 20 years if we poured our resources into paying for food, shelter, healthcare, and education for EVERYONE.

If you cut everything down to McDonald's quality it's definitely cheaper. Or alternatively, you only include a $1.20 worth of ingredients in each burger you can probably get two for one. \n\nPizza is a favorite. $14 for two medium sized pizzas (pickup not delivery) is three or four meals for a a young dude. $2.50 a meal, let's say. I can buy a can of sauce, a block a cheese, and two shells (making dough would be cheaper but let's say that's too much effort) for $8 to make the same amount of meals. Toppings are cheaper as well. What is it to add a topping, $1? $1.50? For each of those you could get the whole onion/pepper/mushroom container and have much leftover. Even meats like pepperoni you can get a packet of for the price of adding it to one or two pizzas but instead you get 4 or 5 pizzas worth.\n\nIt's definitely cheaper to cook yourself. The effort for a meal is generally pretty minimal, though definitely higher. Washing dishes, though, that's a pain in the ass.",

It makes enough kalua pork for her to use it for all kinds of things like salads, burgers (pork + bbq sauce on a burger is the shit). She usually makes kalua pork burgers when she's lazy and doesn't want to cook bc it only takes her a minute to do. \n\nWe also get costco chickens a few times a month bc its healthy and super cheap. She also makes korean spicy tofu soup which is fast.\n\nMostly when she cooks, for \"expensive\" meals, that means salmon, which is only like $9/lb which isn't much. The only truly expensive thing we eat at home is costco ribeye cap steak which is ~$26/lb but that's not even healthy.\n\nGoing out to get takeout, she gets In N Out burger ($15), or this Hawaiian BBQ place (also ~$15) or a poke bowl place (~$16 and actually healthy). The only cheap junk food is Costco pizza/hotdogs. Actual fast food is usually expensive as hell.",

And \"the market\" is simply another word for The People. So, it you're a poet, and write wonderful poetry, The People reward you by buying your books of poetry. However, there may not be much of a market for poetry- - turns out The People like crap such as *50 Shades of Gray* more than high-quality poetry. You may think you *deserve* more money for your efforts, but that's not how money works.\n\nSocialists either don't understand this, or *refuse* to accept it. They believe The People *should* value poetry over pop fiction drivel, so they take money from The People and give it to the poets, and other 'undervalued' members of society.",

None of the restante people were any good as most just pick up their collections bills (which they throw away) but some people were decent to interact with. But back then freddy pants were becoming the hottest shit ever and all the thots would order them and I could tell a mile away who is going to come pick up their pants which makes their skinny ass look better. It's mainly boring work so for someone with more than two brain cells (I'm almost there) you start to come up with patterns and try to see if you can apply it to people. \n\nSome of my coworkers were in incognito mode so they would not remember anyone from before unless it was a customer of 20 years. They did not give out favors or think too much about the customers, but I guess that happens when you spend 40 years doing the same shit, what's the point anymore?",
