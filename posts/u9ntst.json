  "text": "TIFU telling my parents about my inheritance\nTLDR; sister died and left me her home, parents tried to sell it so I had to explain the will. Now they\u2019re gonna sue me. \n\n[edited to fix spelling / grammar / weird ass sentences I used]\n\nMy 36F sister died 6 months ago from a heart condition. She practically raised me so it\u2019s been difficult to deal with. I\u2019m in my final year of University and have failed every single class this semester. She\u2019d be disappointed but it is what it is. My sister never married, never had children. I lived with her near campus. She ran her successful side business, I got to help her occasionally as a paid intern. She worked a lot but not to support us, she wanted to retire by the time she was 40. She would\u2019ve been done in 4 years and her heart had to fail her first. \n\nWhen she died, her attorney read her will to me. She had left everything to me. She had a generous amount of money put away for her retirement and side accounts for various activities for her retirement. I did not know that she had made several real estate investments so she could continue living a comfy lifestyle once she retired.  She left her 2006 Subaru to me and willed our current house to me as well. She left nothing to my parents but as they didn\u2019t know she had assets, they willingly paid for the funeral and any other associated costs. My sister was no contact with our parents and I\u2019m very low contact. We are their only two children. \n\nAt the funeral my parents asked me how I was going to continue going to college without her money (lol, they thought she paid for them. Sike I have student debt.) I told them I\u2019d continue to take out loans. They asked about my living arrangements and I shrugged, at the time I didn\u2019t know all the details anyway. Well 2 weeks ago, I found out my parents tried to sell my sisters house whilst I still lived there. They brought a realtor and toured our home and everything. it was all on the cameras set up in the home. When I called them and informed them I\u2019d be calling the police, they explained the situation. I told them it\u2019s my home and it was willed to me. They couldn\u2019t sell it. They were confused heavily. I told them to meet at my attorneys and set a time. \n\nCue today. My attorney explained the will to my parents. My mother went white as a sheet and my father was grumbling about suing me for his rightful money plus the cost of the funeral. My mother began ugly sobbing telling the attorney he was wrong, her daughter would not leave the house to someone like me. The attorney cut the meeting short and now we\u2019re preparing for the inevitable lawsuit coming my way. I just want to sleep and avoid all of this. \n\njust some added info: mom is a stay at home mum but like the kind who spends her life at the country club, not the involved kind. Dad is a business man and is typically on business trips for weeks at a time. They live, as they call it, lower upper class.\n\nedit: I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up tbh, thank you everyone for the support. I\u2019ve gotten to read almost all the comments and I feel a lot less anxious now. I did talk to my professors and 4/6 of them gave me extensions but the other two are being jerks about it. It\u2019s fine tho. I did sign up for my schools grief group. I just got done changing all my locks too. Thanks to everyone who helped me with home stuff too, I\u2019ll be sure to watch the home insurance bill or get a financial advisor or something. My sisters degrees and mine are in the same field so I\u2019ll be continuing her business too and I\u2019ll need a real estate attorney to redo the leases on her other rentals I guess. I don\u2019t know it\u2019s overwhelming.\n\nedit2: since this keeps coming up, I stupidly gave them a key a few months after she passed. I didn\u2019t know they\u2019d even be trying this until after the fact. The will doesn\u2019t say anything about them but I\u2019m leaving it up to the attorney to figure everything out. I will be paying them regardless for the cost of funeral, celebration of life, etc.\n\nFinal Update for now: father sent me a text apologising, said he wanted to sell the house because of the market right now but won\u2019t push me. will give more details at some point, gonna see how this plays out first and I\u2019ll give an official update at some point.",

It sucks but I did have some success with simply being polite and engaged with the professor, which allowed me to give unsolicited advice at times that was positively received. It totally depends on the personality of the faculty member, but it sounds like this guy is \u201cnice\u201d, so he might be persuaded.\n\nEDIT: I feel it\u2019s relevant to point out that my school has small class sizes. A \u201clarge\u201d section is 70 people; a normal class is 20-30. At a big research school with section sizes of several hundred students, it\u2019s highly unlikely the professor will get to know you. But in my case, I usually knew my professor quite well by midterms, and many of them are on my Christmas card list\u2026",

Also failed to address my own toxic parents, which I have now addressed and will continue to manage.\n\nThat's all really. I'm fine. I graduated and got two additional degrees but that year with the calc prof was one of the worst. I went around feeling the performance on my transcript, precorrection, was based on my work ethic and intellectual limits. But the dude was just an asshole.  Oh, he also never called on female students to answer questions in class.\n\nHe had tenure. Omg. This was so bad",

I always pictured higher Ed as some noble pursuit with gatekeepers being these inscrutable bastions of morality. Some come close, but at the end of the day, a job is a job and people are people. I\u2019d like to think that negative traits like apathy, poor self awareness, and a lack of empathy are less prevalent among folks who gravitate toward education, medical and the helping professions, but the more time I spend around them, the less likely that seems.

There is an entire system set up for students in difficult situations to help you either withdraw from your classes (meaning it protects your GPA) or to negotiate the situation with your professors). If you negotiate, they assign you an umbudsperson. This is the situation at a large state university, at least. Your 2 professors who are not giving you extensions? Well- we hear nonstop tragedy stories as excuses, and some become numb. Or, honestly, as universities are more and more following \u201cthe business model\u201d they are feeling the whip of oppression themselves and are buried in work. It doesn\u2019t hurt to be proactive, send a copy of the obituary (I\u2019m sooo sorry for your loss) and a plan of when you will get them the work. They should be able to give you an INCOMPLETE grade that gives you an extension to complete (usually max of one semester) that will change to a grade when you\u2019ve done it. This way you do not lose tuition. If your professors do not allow you to do this, go to their Department Chair (it\u2019s on the website). Chairs often field requests like this. If the chair won\u2019t help you, go to their Dean. Each time you need to show the obituary or something from the funeral. I\u2019m so sorry for that but we\u2019re a fairly \u201cevidence based\u201d lot of people in general in Academia and it cuts out the 5 minute talk asking you painful questions to determine if you\u2019re telling the truth. Hang in there! Your sister\u2019s got your back, even in her after life. What a saint. I\u2019m sorry your parents struggle to show any love/affection. As a parent, it took me many years to understand my own single mom, who has Asbergers. She just shows love differently. I\u2019m glad your dad called you to explain his thinking. There\u2019s also a lot of tribalism going on with political divisions. I\u2019m meeting students whose parents disown them because they are not Trump followers. It\u2019s a weird time and I hope young adults can come to one day forgive their parents for the brainwashing they\u2019ve fallen to. It sounds like you have a comfortable life ahead of you- thanks to your incredible sister who knows you\u2019ll do good with her inheritance. :)",

If you get in contact with them and explain situations (present or future) they\u2019re able to communicate with all your professors and request extensions on your behalf. It definitely works better than asking profs yourself. \n\nEven if it might be too late to get extensions this semester, I\u2019d check in with them and explain the situation and preface that next semester could be a challenge depending on the course of any lawsuits. \n\nLastly, do not take shit from anyone!!!! It can be super scary but make sure your stand up for yourself. Some profs can be borderline inhumane but try not to let it get you down. There\u2019s often more helpers than not. I\u2019ve had severe health issues my whole life and some educators refuse to understand trying circumstances. However, if you touch base at the beginning of your course and throughout the semester, it\u2019s much more likely they\u2019ll be understanding and do what they can to help you. \n\nI would always attend office hours at the beginning of the semester to introduce myself and my circumstances. Just a brief \u201chey I\u2019m so-and-so, I\u2019m in your BUSA 231 course. I just wanted to give you a heads up that my attendance may be a bit spotty. My sister who raised me and was my mother figure passed away last year. Our parents recently found out she didn\u2019t include them in her will and are now attempting to sue me. As you can imagine, things have been pretty crazy and although my education is incredibly important to me, protecting my sister\u2019s wishes and keeping a roof over my head is going to be my #1 priority for the near future.

Keep your professors, advisors, dept heads aware of what's going on. It is better to not fail a class, than withdraw or take an incomplete. A failing grade will severely hurt your gpa,  and affect your attempted/completed percentage. All of which may affect your ability to get financial aid. Beyond those short term issues, F's on a transcript may make it hard to find competitive jobs in your field.\n \nIn the event those two professors choose to fail ( which as an aside, is so fucked) you can appeal the grade to the department and to higher ups. If that happens, make to have documentation- emails, certificates, copies of outreach to everyone. The burden of proof rests on you.  \n\nFinally, I just want to send my deepest condolences and sympathy to you. If you need any advice or anything, know that you have a support team not just on Reddit, but also at your university. Take advantage of counseling services. Usually it is included in tuition and fees. You are not going through alone, use your community when you need it.",

They might not offer it, but it's worth a shot in extenuating circumstances like this. It doesn't absolve you of your wasted time and money, but it might help you re-take those courses without it significantly impacting your record in the future. It doesn't matter for a lot of things, but if you were going into something like medical school where the schools can see re-taken classes, it'll turn them into W's and you can explain in an interview what happened rather than them assuming you're just a bad student and never getting the chance to explain.",

If someone can trick the registry into transferring the title, a subsequent purchaser has good title so long as they weren't party to the scam.

They like to use scare stories like the idea that you'll lose your house without title insurance. It's a billion dollar a year industry that pays out less than 1% of it's premium dollars in claims. Health insurance pays like 95%.\n\nThose claims when paid out are largely boundary disputes that cost at most a couple hundred dollars. No realtor I talked to has ever mentioned having a client with a serious claim.\n\nIn one state (Indiana I believe) it's a program by the government and it costs $150. \n\nMy home was built almost seventy years ago. I have photocopies of every deed, transfer and lien that was in the house from the county office and it cost...$14.\n\nAs a lendee you're not required to have title insurance but they \"strongly recommend it.\" They'll even say you can bring your own if you don't want to buy from the provider the lender recommends.\n\nGo try to find private title insurance. You basically can't. They only deal with lenders and real estate agencies.\n\nTitle insurance is a huge scam.",

For one thing she went through the whole process of the estate insanely quickly and somehow next of kin were not involved in it at all. I don't know if simply willing one person everything makes it a more simple process but the average estate takes 18 months to settle with time periods baked in to let everyone who \"may be a part of it or may feel like they should have been a part of it\" have a chance to contest some aspect of the will or another. \n\nFrom another angle, the parents may have been cosigners on the original home loan and either believed it defaulted to them or that they were entitled to it. And maybe the loan was paid off, but they felt they contributed to the home in some meaningful way as their first born grew into the place. Or maybe they bought it outright for her if they're as well off as op claims\n\nEdit: the point is we don't know a ton of details here, some of it feels off for multiple reasons and I'm not going to jump to conclusions unless op elaborates further, but when these kinda charged posts happen and there's no interaction from op in the comments, I feel like it's more of a creative writing prompt they're crowd sourcing improvements on.",

There was actually a Reddit post about a guy who got a$1 from a grandparents will for this exact reason. It simply shows someone was not forgotten.

I probably have.\n\nI had hoped you would have reacted like reasonable, emotionally secure adult with a pair of balls but you actually were triggered by my comment. Lol fucking gold.\n\nOP, look at this guy's second comment here that I'm replying to. THIS is the type of person you DON'T want to take advice from.\n\nThis guy is saying to go the long, stressful, revenge fueled, expensive legal route against your parents after your sister died... what he's telling you to do is vindictive back and will only draw out the process. It is A ROUTE but likely unnecessary. Maybe your parents just want money to pay for the funeral expenses. I don't think you've even gotten that far in the talks with them yet so why would you countersue them into oblivion before a compromise has even been discussed?\n\nGoing to the extremes of legal defense as this guy is recommending is usually last resort when more basic forms of mediation isn't working.",

The reason behind this is more of a policy reason. This ensures funeral homes get paid for their services, which allows them to continue performing funerals knowing they will get paid.",

It was the sister's apparent wish that it go to OP.  No court is going to defy that if the will is legit.\n\nEdit: As someone rightly pointed out: not a verbal offer from OP, but a formal written offer via OP's lawyer, ONLY IF they advise it.

                              "text": "(MI) IANAL, but I can answer this. When someone dies and has assets you only need a will for certain assets. Take the house, bank account, and retirement investments in this case. \n\nAny asset with benefactors (like your insurance policy or 401k) do not need a will and do not go through probate. If a probate case is opened, these assets are excluded from it. So her retirement stuff probably just went to him automatically.  \n\nLets take the house. The deeds, titles and mortgages do not have benefactors (at least not in MI). If you die they go to the next of next of kin. Living spouse gets everything you own by default. EVERYTHING. Your comicbook collection that you wanted your daughter to have? Doesn't matter spouse gets it. Now she can give it to daughter, or through waive it to the daughter through probate for tax purposes. But by default the daughter gets it. No living spouse? Then legal children get it. Step kids don't get anything if you don't will them something or adopt them and make them not step kids. If any one of them is dead, their children (the grandchildren) split their share and so on. Spouses is children get nothing. But OP's sister didn't have any legal children. So who's next in line? Spouse > kids > PARENTS. Without a will anything that is still in her name would go to the parents but default. But this could apply to anything like a car, business, individual stock, bank account, action comics number 1, etc. If something is jointly owned your inherit the percentage they owned (some exceptions apply). \n\nSo that's the point in the will here, she wanted her brother to get everything and without it he wasn't getting shit that wasn't already passed to him legally or that he wasn't the benefactor on. Without that will, the parents would get the house.",

                              "text": "It's an interesting question isn't it. Is it bad statistic? Approx 4% of wills are contested, depending on where you are the success rate starts at about 60% and goes up. That's what makes it to court though, it appears that a little over half get settled, so it's should be closer to 9 or 10% are contested. That's just wills as if someone dies without a will common law dictates how it gets handled.\n\nNow I see a few replies mentioning lawyers not taking on cases they don't think they can win. Which is true but they're also not going to take on cases where they're not getting paid, contesting a will is expected to cost $100,000+ so if the estate is worth $500k and there are 5 siblings and one has been left off, the one left off, may still be successful at contesting the will but due to the lawyers fees, any prospective \"win\" is going to be obliterated. (This may well be the sort of range where the settlements kick in, not enough to let go of, but also not enough to survive a court battle, so giving a bit is better for everyone.)\n\nSo no-one is going to contest a will unless there is actually a significant amount involved. \n\nLet's look at the USA for a second. According to stats from 2020, 6.71% of US households could claim millionaire status. \n\nNow the thing that originally got me to look up the successfully contested rate. Was finding out about a guy who died without any family, he owned a ridiculous amount of art, both in number of pieces and value. His will setup an trust where the art would be used solely for educational purposes at no expense to the school or students and IIRC even specified a number of institutions which would have access. A group of art collectors, unrelated to him in any way, successfully contested the will and gained ownership of all his artwork. One of whom got into a flap towards the end of his life because he also didn't have family wrote out a surprisingly similar will and then realisation hit.\n\nEdit : reworded sentence about lawyers fees so it makes more sense. And added some speculation on settlements",

The attorney cut the meeting short and now we\u2019re preparing for the inevitable lawsuit coming my way. I just want to sleep and avoid all of this.\n\nNope. If there was no will, the parents might be right. It would have been intestate (no will) and with no spouse or kids, it would usually (in the US) go to your parents. If there was no will, no one would have contacted them. However, since there was a will, if the will was probated, the parents should have been contacted. Since the parents weren't aware of the will it either hasn't been probated yet or the attorney may have messed up and failed to contact the parents. \n\nNot for nothing, but failing to be transparent about stuff like this tends to prompt people to sue when they might not have sued if they'd known the details in advance.",

But that doesn't count the hours the 3 of put into that unit for 6 weeks, which was over 400 hours between the three of us. \n\nIf OP decided to rent out the units, make sure to do thorough background checks, and don't rent to first time tennants (let someone else take that risk), and consider monthly check-ins so you aren't surprised by a literal mountain of garbage.",

Since housing is a necessity most people forget that it is a high risk investment and assume it must pay out because it's holding life or death on the line for profit, while ignoring the reality that most renters are paycheck to paycheck and could stop paying rent and strip the house at a moments notice by necessity. Creating a commodity out of a necessity seems like a sure deal, until you take more than half a second to think about it and realize that anyone losing such a vital necessity will almost always go scorched Earth as there is nothing left to lose. Investing is investing, and carries risks regardless of the flavor of investment. If you can't absorb those risks you're an entitled asshole if you take them anyway and act all victimized afterwards. Holding hostages is always risky, whether you're robbing a bank or kicking a family out of their home that you were lucky enough to have them pay your mortgage for you.\n\nIf op  is in the US they should sell everything they can to avoid federal student loans and their absurd interest rates. Not only is it the morally superior choice to not attempt to profit off of other people's necessities to life, it'll also save them money in the long run as the high risk investment is unlikely to exceed guaranteed federal student loan interest rates. Making 2% on average from a $200k investment while paying 7% on a $200k student loan is just stupid and is a net loss, even if you disregard all the morel issues of attempting to profit off of being lucky enough to have more handed to you.",

They are able to suck up energy (and money). You can't kick them out, as they are well protected by law and regulation, you get stuck with 'em.\n\nTurnover by itself can be done quite cheaply and it allows for setting up a new contract (a steeper raise in pricing). Over the whole, regular turnover leads to a higher income -  having already taken into account the costs of finding new tenants.\n\nSo  turnover itself isn't costly, it is that it carries with it risk. Good tenants are appreciated because they carry very little risk and allow for stable income.\n\nIt's a subtle -  but fundamental - difference.\n\nLet me quote you:\n\n>Good landlord\u2019s will cut good tenants deals because turnover is expensive\n\nShould be:\n\n>Good landlord\u2019s will cut good tenants deals because turnover is risky\n\nOr:\n\n>Good landlord\u2019s will cut good tenants deals because bad tenants are expensive",

But any extra investment should return most of its costs in the appreciation of the house (the value). The owner holds the house (directly or via mortgage), remember. The owner can arbitrarily choose to sell the house. The net worth of the owner depends partly on the valuation of the house.\n\nSimilarly, say it was a mortgage. A bank would be keen to increase the mortgage (or lend additional money) if the value of the asset as a whole increases. \n\nHence most of this additional maintenance costs goes into the asset itself and doesn't need to fully covered by the raise in rent. In so far that it does, it is welcome though. As some investment (like a new kitchen or 'lightning') don't translate that well into a higher appreciation compared to others (extra square meters/ft, energy efficiency).\n\nAllowing bigger maintenance and having the ability to find a moment to sell the house *without* tenants are actually two other arguments in favor of somewhat regular turnover.",

I don't and I did taxes for high net worth individuals for years. It's always about the money. \n\nHousing co-ops can accomplish what landlords do without the profit incentive and without inflating housing prices for everyone. It's why Berlin has started purchasing properties to rent at reasonable rates because rent is become too unaffordable.",

They either buy them to fix up and flip or to rent them. If they flip them they just improved the quality of the house and brought money a bit of money to the local economy. If they rent them then they still have to rent them to someone living in that area, so the cost to rent the house still has to follow supply and demand.\n\nHowever, outside corporations buying homes \nforce local people to rent instead of buy, keeping them out of the market (which can be very detrimental because as you say being in the market can be very profitable).\n\nI don't like the idea of these huge scale corporations bidding out the little guy. These corporations are very different than people like OP who own a couple properties and rent them out. Small scale landlords don't have the same monopolistic power as the corporations. The smaller landlords usually have a positive effect on the market by filling the demand for homes to rent while reinvesting money into the home itself.\n\nI'm also not convinced that these corporate investors are the main cause of housing rising so much during Covid. I would argue it is more to do with historically low supply for housing, historically low mortgage rates, and millennials growing up and wanting to buy homes.",

People who cannot afford to buy a house can pool their money in a housing coop.\n\nI think that the housing crisis will go away if we change our zoning laws to make it easier for more low cost homes to be built. Changing these laws are tricky though because the majority of Americans own homes and they aren't likely to vote for legislation that will make their home go down in value.\n\nI don't think we need to go for as drastic of a solution as you are proposing, and perhaps more importantly, I don't think something like that will get passed through the government anytime soon.

Given the sister's investments strategy to be able to retire by 40, I have to believe that she wasn't a dummy. She had a will in her 30's which is very uncommon which leads me to believe that everything in it was planned and calculated. She wanted to make a point that the parents weren't in it. I'd also have to believe that with the number of assets she has, she organized everything through an estate planning attorney before she passed. On the surface, I would think it would be water tight from anyone feeling left out. But there are so many details not mentioned that quite frankly, we aren't entitled to answers on. Unfortunately, this burden is on OP who has to process their sister's passing (who was obviously very close to them), the parents looking to make a buck of their child's success, and lawyers who looking to strip the meat off the bone.",

They would not have been contacted by the estate atty because they were not in the Will.  So they'd have no way of really knowing if a Will existed.\n\nThe funeral costs would come from the estate, before the estate was settled.  The executor of the Will, whether OP or the attorney, would have to post public notice of the estate for settling of all debts. Funerals costs are the debt of the decedent and are a priority obligation, meaning they get settled before the rest of the estate's bills and obligations.  Any Will would also have provisions in it for the cost and settlement of the estate including the expenses of the funeral.  With OP's sister's assets, an attorney drawing up this Will would be remiss in not ensuring it was included so that this exact situation does not happen.  If it wasn't in the Will... bad attorney.  If the estate was not settled properly, bad Executor.  With funerals, they almost always happen immediately after death... far before a typical estate can be properly settled.  The thing that the parents' should do is simply bill the estate (rather than sue).  Although, if they plan on suing for being left out, then throwing the cost into the suit is simple.\n\nIt's an almost certain win for the parents (reimbursement for funeral costs).  They will likely also get some of the estate, unless there was explicit language indicating they were explicitly excluded.  \n\nEDIT:  your mileage may very... estate laws can vary from state to state in the US.",

I thought maybe it was just him panicking since she was the sole provider but he had enough money to keep his lifestyle for many years. Fast forward a few weeks and he told me just a few days before my mom's ashes ceremony that he had hired a lawyer. Once he had a lawyer, we went through many accusations. He first made the claim he didn't understand I bought it and he thought I renting it from them. When that didn't work he made the claim I underpaid for the house and screwed them over, even though I overpaid to help them out. After we proved that I didn't underpay for the house, he finally made the claim that my mom and I schemed against him and forced him to sell, he even stated that if my mom was still alive he would sue her for marital breach of contract but because she died, he had to go after me. He played the victim card many times over and played the \"I'm old and she took advantage\" card a lot. He wanted a judge to just overturn the sale and revert the deed back into his name so he could sell my home at market value (currently 3x what it was worth 5 years ago). He had never behaved like this before. His actions over the last year have caused him to lose his children and grandchildren, as well as friends. He obviously didn't get what he wanted but the lengths I had to go through to clear my name this last year and disprove all of his claims was insane.",

So I'm very familiar with fee fights. The word \"reasonable\" *does* impose limits. But \"reasonable\" fees can also be very high.\n\nImagine you have good reason to think a business defrauded you. If you win, it might destroy their reputation. Would its expenditure of $750,000 to save $10 million in future earnings be unreasonable?\n\nDepending on the jurisdiction, there might be consideration provided for undue hardship or ability to pay. But that creates a problem for the other party. Why should they bear the cost of your penury?\n\nThere are no perfect answers here. My rough view is that awarding fees in the context of negotiated relationships works well (typically in commercial relationships). It works less well in cases where the parties can't or at least don't negotiate their relationship. (But that doesn't cover everything -- e.g., actions involving the government.)",

Then, under the American system, you can file a suit and in the worst case you'll just lose the cost for your own lawyers. That's a cost you can budget for and control. But, under a system where you'll also have to pay the fees for the winning side, you have no way to control the costs. If the other party has deep pockets, they could hire very expensive attorneys. And then that not only increases the chance that you'll lose the case, it also increases the cost you have to pay if you lose.\n\nSo under a system where you have to pay the fees for the winning side, you take on almost unlimited financial risk when suing a rich defendant. Whereas under the American system the financial risk is limited and somewhat predictable.\n\nAnother argument, along the same lines, is that if the winner is awarded attorney's fees, and both sides are convinced that they are right, you can more easily get into a situation with escalating costs. Not only will this ultimately be financially ruinous for the losing party, but it might also tie up the legal system for longer than necessary because neither side is willing to give up.",

Do you really want to pay their much higher fees if you lose?\n\nThat risk is mitigated in cases where people can negotiate their relationship (e.g., business relationships), and you more often see contract provisions and states in those contexts that provide fee awards to the winner.\n\nJust be careful what you ask for. Most plaintiff's lawyers in my experience prefer that there be no award of fees in most cases.\n\nThere is, of course, the risk that people will bring weak or even frivolous cases if there's no award of fees to the winner. That's a real but fairly small problem. Lawyers don't like losing and ending up working for free, so they generally tend to do a decent job screening out completely meritless cases.",

During his final last few months. Family I've never seen before started to crawl out of the woods work. The day of his funeral, people who I've never heard of (and my grand parents told me everything) would show up and tell me how close they were and that they should be allowed his nice things. I had enough and shut a shit load of people up. My grandmother even told my brother who was \"too busy\" to drive 2 hours to visit the last 3 years to go back home because he was trying to take all of his large power tools. My brother didn't even have a garage. He was going to sell everything he could get his hands on. My grandma ended up just giving me his knives, tools, ties, watches, etc because she didn't want to deal with people and knew I was the only family member who picked up the skills to use the equipment and would actually use them.",

I\u2019m hazy about the timeline because this happened before I was born, but my grandma\u2019s and her sister\u2019s family had a relatively good relationship until my great grandmother died. My parents told me the story of how, when my great grandmother was very sick and close to the end, he\u2019d go round to her house and start measuring the house right in front of her (obviously to sell it and keep the money for himself), even though he knew there was a will that said the house was going to my grandma because she was the one who took care of her parents until the end and also had no stream of income because she was a divorced housewife. The whole thing ended in a legal fight which he thankfully did not win, but it severed the ties between the two families pretty much entirely and now the only ones who keep in touch are my grandma and her sister.",

That said, it is still absurdly low, especially given this:\n\n> 6.7% of eligible student borrowers apply for loan forgiveness.\n\nThat seems absurd.

When my grandpa left everything in his will to my grandma his children who were partly raised by my grandma protested because they wanted to divide everything soley between them. They also feared that the assets would be divided by them and my father when my grandma died. Unfortunately my father died 2 years ago. My grandma is still alive and I can only imagine what will happen when my grandma dies. I'd expect them to put pressure on my sisters and me to refuse any assets going our way.",

She actually left work for over a year to be with her. I sucked it up and worked more to support us. \n\nHer brother worked under the table and claimed unemployment benefits and also demanded money for travel to and from these work sites from his mom. He never once saw her other than for money. \n\nWhen she died, he \"wished\" he wasnt working so hard to support his family so he could spend time with his mom. He also tells people that my gf trick his \"dying\" mom into giving her everything. \n\nHes currently suing us now because we have the audacity to sell the home and \"make money\". We spent $25K of our own money for the funerals and took care of her mom's bills for 2 years after her father died. \n\nSituation just pisses me off more and more as i think about it.",

You're making it sound like the money is obviously more important to them than the daughter's death, but there is actually no implication of that at all.\n\nBeing mad about missing out on the money does not in any way imply anything about how they feel about the death. Their daughter is gone and that can't be helped, but (in their stupid heads) the money is not gone. (It is though. It's gone. They're assholes.)\n\nI'm a fair person (sometimes to a problematic extent) so as someone without any kids, I *do not* consider myself entitled to an opinion on anything that involves a parent's feelings about their kids, because I understand those feelings only in theory and imo that's not good enough to be running my mouth about it.\n\nSo the best I can do (I acknowledge that this makes it different from the story and therefore irrelevant to it, but I ponder everything) is imagine losing my siblings or parents, and I'm sure that no amount of heartbreak would stop me from giving fucks about inheritance.\n\n*BUT* having said all that, I do agree that the parents are assholes and that their behavior is inexcusable. I *like* to think (as in I don't know for sure) that respecting my lost sibling/parent would include respecting their wishes, and that any damage to my feelings or lack of help to my living situation would be my problem and mine alone.",

One of the two rich uncles had an accident years ago that left him paralyzed from the chest down and he doesn\u2019t have any kids and is declining in health and I\u2019m written into his will as if I was his son as he practically raised me. Because of his accident he was awarded around $6 million after the lawyers from the lawsuit in the late 80s/early 90s and has done very well investing with it over the past 30 years. The split is I get 50% of his investment accounts and cash. The other 50% is split 5 ways between his siblings. I will also get several million from life insurance and his house. However none of the 10 other nieces and nephews are getting anything. My cousins have never said anything to me about it but their parents (my aunts and uncles) have chirped at me and made condescending comments about me being his \u201cspecial boy\u201d. I have a strong feeling the will is going to be contested from day one and I will be sued every which way to Sunday. \n\nMy uncle actually just said to me the other day not to fight with people (meaning my aunts and uncles) and be civil when he\u2019s gone and that it isn\u2019t worth burning bridges and that if I cut contact \u201cwherever you land people will think it\u2019s weird if you tell them that you don\u2019t have a family\u201d.

It\u2019s quite sad, and for me such a glaring example of how early intervention with autism is *so* helpful. He wasn\u2019t diagnosed until he was in his 60s. Anyway, best of luck to you.

My FIL did the exact same thing, we booked a vacation to visit family in California, and he just bought a plane ticket to go along with us. Didn\u2019t even see a problem with it until we told him. It\u2019s mind-boggling sometimes, it really is, but autism makes it so he literally can\u2019t see it or understand it on his own. Could be worth getting your FIL assessed by a professional, but could be very hard to convince him to do. You could start by just looking up some diagnostic info online, see if he meets more of the criteria.",

I was the kid that always had shoes and jeans with holes. I got a job at 14 and never used my parents money again. My wife and I were married in 2007 and paid for everything ourselves and went into debt for it. After working 2 jobs plus doing graphic design on the side and my wife working as well we ended up out of debt within a couple years. We had a credit card with a 700 dollar limit and a little bit of savings that bought us our first t-shirt printer. We started selling t-shirts online and eventually had enough money between everything to get into a house.\n\nFast forward to today and we have 3 kids. We own 3 companies. 2 of which were started from scratch and the third was just purchased this year. We own a few real estate properties as well.\n\nSo to sum up this story which I could have turned into a damn book, the poor kids with minimal college that we paid for ourselves built an empire that started with working our asses off and a 700 dollar limit credit card.\n\nIf that makes me naive and entitled then I guess I am. I'm teaching my kids to be better than me. I won't be giving them handouts or free money. They will learn to work hard and earn their future and ill be there to help them succeed.\n\nEdit: and if I die first, I got life insurance that I struggled to pay to make sure if I left too soon my family would still know I gave a shit. My parents turned into deadbeats and im going to have to pick up the mess and the debt from them because my siblings aren't far off from useless.",

I cant imagine just shaking off a lifetime of poverty habits. My fiance and i are only 24 but even after almost 5 years on our own and an uphill battle to lower middle class life, neither of us have broken out of the \"growing up poor\" habits. We both hoard extra money like it'll disappear if we arent careful. We buy bulk, sale hunt, rarely eat out, dont buy snacky fluff food, extras are rare, etc. We have to remind each other we are allowed to have more than one thin slice of turkey or roast beef on a sandwich, that theres nothing to stress about if we finish the last of any various toiletry, that we dont have to wear clothes until the seams are literally falling out, and that its ok to buy \"unnecessary\" things to have just to enjoy. \n\nIf its that hard to relax just from growing up poor, how would you possibly break that habit if poverty had been your whole life? I just cant wrap my head around getting millions and blowing through it in a few years. If my partner and i won a jackpot of 2 mil, i think theres 3 things wed do. 1: Pay off the 166k mortgage on the house we bought last year. 2: Pay off his parents' house. 3: Pay off my parent's house. And then we'd save/invest the rest and continue to otherwise work/live as we generally have. We are both always so stressed that something will come along and leave us penniless that i think wed be happier sitting on it for our own peace of mind than spending it left and right.",

She was very loving and generous - and also very forgetful. The closest anyone had to a fight that week was when the three of us all tried to give the ring to each other. Finally, my aunt and I ganged up on my cousin, who is the youngest of the three of us, and told her she had to have it. She hasn\u2019t sold it - she wouldn\u2019t, even though at the time she could have used the money. Instead, she brings it to every family wedding and makes it available to the bride to wear in case they want to think of our grandmother.\n\nThat\u2019s the best legacy I can think of - that she raised a family that cares a lot more about each other than anything else.

He regularly picks up books from retirement communities, sorts through them, and takes them to the proper places.  You need to find a thrift store or recycling organization that employs someone who sorts books like this.  Yes, quite a few end up recycled, because, for example, a book on wordperfect is basically useless now.  No one wants it.\n\nWhat I found interesting was prisons actually appreciate children's books to help illiterate prisoners learn to read.  They also love books on the trades to teach prisoners job skills.  Thrift stores take more general interest stuff - cookbooks, popular novels, and nonfiction (think NYT bestseller list).  Some rather obscure books can be quite valuable and can be sold on ebay to benefit nonprofits.  Only those who work this field really know.",

If that works for them, great! In many cases it does not and has exactly the opposite effect than is intended by the gifter.",

This woman went into full greed mode, trying to lay claim to everything he had, property, possessions, money, everything. He had 2 surviving daughters and 4 grandkids. My mother and her sister wound up negotiating for his land but that was all anyone got. \n\nHe had let it be known for years that he had a safety deposit box with something for each grand kid but nobody knew what we were supposed to get except for me. We only knew what I was supposed to get because I was his oldest grandchild and he started the tradition of putting the gift away before he decided to start keeping it a secret when the other grandkids came along. These weren't major gifts at all. It was more of a sentimental token than anything. For example my gift was a silver dollar that he used to carry in his pocket all the time. It was worn nearly smooth from carrying it so much but when I was born he put it away.\n\nAfter he died my mother, her sister, and my great-grandmother had an appointment set to go to the bank and open the box and distribute the contents. My great-grandmother decided to have one of her other sons drive her up there a day early and cleaned out the box by herself. She tried to claim there was nothing in it but everyone spoke up on my behalf about the silver dollar. She eventually gave it up but still insisted he didn't leave anything in there for the other grandkids and since he never told anyone what it was supposed to be nobody could really argue with her and my brother and cousins wound up with nothing.\n\nThe whole thing was a nightmare and I never spoke to my great-grandmother again after that. She was in her late 80's herself at the time and as near death as she was she was still so greedy. She wound up passing away a few years later and I didn't even go to the funeral. We never found out what was in the box for the other grandkids. Whatever it was she either sold it, gave it away, or it was all just mixed in among her other possessions and distributed among the remaining family after she passed.\n\nMy whole goddamned family is like this actually. My mother and her sister are still fighting over my grandmother's estate(her and my granddad divorced before I was born so this is an entirely separate estate) and she died over 4 years ago.",

That part is not what I was commenting on. \n\nu/that_70s_line is suggesting that ignorance of probate would entitle the parents to access. Which I don\u2019t think is true in any jurisdiction. The the legal implications for parental rights might very well differ by jurisdiction. But I don\u2019t think there is any jurisdiction where you\u2019re allowed to just walk in to property you don\u2019t own. Regardless of whether or not you think you have rights, or might, in fact, eventually have rights. I\u2019m not a nationwide real estate guru but I\u2019m unaware of any place in the US that doesn\u2019t have the right of quiet enjoyment. It means the owner of the place you live doesn\u2019t get to just wander in to your dwelling unannounced. On top of that, certainly OPs parents would know that they don\u2019t yet own that property even if they might eventually.\n\nSo, yeah. I read it. I\u2019m not mad at the commenter. It seems like a reasonable thought. But it\u2019s probably incorrect unless OP lives in some weird real estate anomaly like Louisiana.",

States have different laws, and even some municipalities have their own stipulations that can dramatically affect legal advice given. People go online looking for concrete legal advice to rather nuanced situations that literally require you to speak with an attorney that actually knows the law for that area. If anything, that's significantly better advice than someone who isn't versed in that area giving half baked legal advice that may or may not even be accurate. And a licensed attorney can get goddamn disbarred for giving legal advice to someone in a state or area they aren't licensed in. Reddit legal advice is, at best, MAYBE a good spot to get pointed in the right direction, but the reality is anyone's best course of action is to consult an attorney (most offer free consultations for this exact reason) to get a real understanding of what legal leg they have to stand on and where they need to begin. States like Massachusetts are going to have a fuck of a big difference in individual legal rights than third world states like Texass.\n\nSeeking concrete legal advice from strangers on the internet is about as smart as using reddit to find the Boston bomber.",

Which we don't do, because we don't want shit we love our Grandma and don't even want to think about her dying. \n\nI like the idea of family, but what it's turned into for most of us is a source of pain and trauma rather than anything positive.",

The only notification they'd have gotten is that their daughter had died. They'd have to go to probate court to apply to be administrators (since they presumed that she died intestate). That might've worked, too, since the court wouldn't know there was a will. Once OP filed the will (since you don't generally pre-file) and tried to be executor, to an estate that already had an administrator, or vice versa, then the shit would have hit the fan. TL;DR - shit was going to hit the fan regardless of when or where but it was a glorious splatter.",

Get someone who can put you 10 steps ahead of them, shut their shit down, and close the book with a signed agreement. Pay the attorney well, and rest assured it will be less than a long drawn out process to try to \u201cwin\u201d. This is a lost situation, so your best bet is to be calm, competent, and carry the bigger stick\u2026or at least swing it harder. \n\nI\u2019ve been here, and I promise you, you\u2019ll be better in the long run if you accept the inevitable and stop this problem right away. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss and I wish you speedy peace.",

That's normal. Your brain will try and process things when it feels ready to, so don't be ashamed in the future of needing the grief service or more support again because this is a complex time with so many things to think about. Support isn't a one and done deal, especially with complications like lawyers getting involved.\n\n\n\n\n Everyone says \"you'll feel ok again one day\" and in the beginning, it feels impossible to imagine and I don't want to undermine just how unbearable this stage can feel.

That way they can't claim they were \"forgotten\" or \"overlooked\" instead of straight up snubbed. So if people contest the will, it's obvious the deceased considered them and made their decision.\n\nIt sucks that you have to deal with this though. Best of luck.",

You can pay a property management company to handle that entirely for you including vetting tenants and collecting rent etc. then you get to keep the property as an investment while renters pay it off. It gives you time to decide what to do with it. We were in a similar situation. I know people hate landlords but when you inherit property sometimes renting it for a bit is a good decision while you figure things out. We rent our properties incredibly fairly and are super lenient with our renters and like being able to help them out. We won\u2019t do anything with the properties as long as they live there because they\u2019re so kind. If any of them wanted to buy their homes we would let much of their back rent count as rent-to-own. One tenant is considering this. It\u2019s been a great opportunity to help people.",

Don't sell, enter in contracts, change school/career path, give anything away, spend, etc.  \n\nPriority number one is to heal.  Most of us haven't grieved such losses so lack practice.  I've gotten better from repeatedly doing it more effectively each time and listening to myself.  When lonely reach out to friends.  When angry shout/vent/release it.  When in denial, wait/work through it.  Avoid alcohol which just extends grieving.  \n\nAs a property owner (multifamilies), renting is tricky, you need to learn/understand laws in your area, and depending what those are, consider wisely.  It sounds like passive income, but when you are cleaning up someone else's dishes and moderating social conflicts between room renters, it becomes a 24/7 full time burden.  That said, income is good, and for some of us, the burden is light.  So as long as you aren't in CA or NY, I'd endorse renting for the next academic year rather than right away.",

I suggest talking to a counselor just for occasional mental health check ins.         \n2. Was your sister's heart condition genetic/hereditary? If so, you should go see a cardiologist and get checked out. It could be something you can manage or fix if you catch it early.        \n3. Unless you are already married (which it doesn't seem you are yet) you should also make up a will stating unequivocally where and to whom you wish to direct your assets; (also get youself some convertible term life insurance now, clearly listing beneficiaries, while you are presumably healthy) to ensure your parents don't get any undue windfall should something happen to you as well.         \n4. Look into the retirement accounts and see whether they are tax qualified (IRA/Roth/401k, etc) as those type you will have a brief window (10 years) to liquidate them.        \n5. If the assets have significant value or equity, like over $500,000; assuming you are around or younger than 30; find a local financial planner (typically a fee only or fee based) who is bound to act in a fiduciary capacity. Also find a highly rated CPA and if your current attorney is not already specialized in estate work, find one. This way they all can advise you on how to work with this unexpected financial windfall and set yourself up in the way your sister intended. You can honor her memory by being smart and strategic with this money, property, and assets.",

All anyone can do with rotten parents is try to take the lemons and make lemonade. \n\nSince you\u2019re inheriting her rentals you\u2019ll need to very quickly get up to speed on what it means to be a landlord. See if there are landlord groups near you that can help you. This is important. You need to be familiar with your rights and responsibilities, and your tenants\u2019 rights and responsibilities. You need a basic familiarity with the law, for example, if a tenant causes a problem, a landlord can\u2019t just change the locks. You need to be familiar with their leases. Read them, and have your real estate attorney explain everything to you. \n\nYour parents would not be able to sell your sister\u2019s house any more than I would as they\u2019re not the owners. They\u2019re not the owners in any way, shape or form. Not sure what your businessman father was thinking. \n\nPlease install security cameras on your house. Please make sure your house is secure. Put nothing past your parents. Money can warp even the nicest seeming person. \n\nPlease reach out to professionals for any help you need. If it looks like you might flunk out of school, please meet with the appropriate person at your school about officially withdrawing for a semester or so, just to get your wits about you, get over this shock, acclimate to your new circumstances, and then re-enroll when you\u2019re in a better place. \n\nAll the best to you.

Get those funds into a secure place where your parents can't get to them. They may have access to accounts you're not aware of. Don't offer to do anything for anyone without consulting your lawyer and/or a good financial planner.

      "text": "5 years ago, I bought my childhood home from my parents because they moved out of state. In 2020, they decided to move back to AZ and purchased a new home in the same neighborhood. A few months later, my mom (who was the moneymaker) died unexpectedly. My dad's reaction (despite becoming a millionaire upon her death - she had no will so my sister and I got nothing) was to sue me for my house and make all kinds of accusations because he wanted me to pay him off. He even told me that I could afford it and said \"ka-ching\". If you ever need to talk, I've been through it. We spent the last 10 months only communicating through lawyers and I've gone no contact with him now that everything is done. Some people, even if they don't need the money, are just horrible.",

The estate will have to be settled, and her will would have to be exposed to any relevant parties regardless of your opinion on the matter. You did not mess up, but perhaps the responses to your post will grant you some insight into how to move forward.\n\nFirst of all, remember that you and your sister had minimal contact with your parents probably for a valid reason. Also remember that they are grieving too. None of you are going to be strictly rational through this process. But don't let your grief be weaponized against you. Try not to get mad about it, everyone involved is grieving. But hold your ground if you have to also.\n\nSecond, your sister was good with her finances. She left everything to you for a reason. The best thing you can do to honor her memory is to trust her plan. The best thing you can do for yourself also is to trust her plan. She knew what she was doing financially or she would not have been that far ahead of the game. She wants you to win at life. So for her sake as well as your own, do that. She already gave you the plan, just go with it.\n\nThe real estate market will go up and down over time. It may  be up now, and it may go down later. But it will also go up again later. What is relevant right now is that you are in school, and need to pay tuition, house yourself, feed yourself, and ideally not take on an incredibly high debt burden, because that will bite you for a very, very long time. Interest will make it worse. Your sister was gracious enough to offer you a way to minimize that. The house is most valuable to you as a house, at least for the time being. You can probably rent her room out to someone else and make a little bit, as well as have someone around to keep you from isolating yourself and falling into a grief spiral too. Likewise, having free room and board in your position is immensely valuable. You can sell it later when the market is up and you are done with school, but for right now, use it as your sister intended that you use it. Do not sell it while you have a use for it. As far as sales go, a house that is very close to a university is always going to be a hot commodity. There  will always be a demand for housing as long as the uni exists, so it will hold it's value. However real estate is useful in a broad number of ways. Selling is only one of those ways. So is living in it. So is renting it. So is using it as collateral for a loan to pursue whatever else you want to do. You have a lot of options, don't be hasty about it. Best thing I can think of in the immediate sense is to just live there, rent her room out to someone who is chill and reliable for whatever is a fair market rate for an apartment in your area, and maybe score a buddy in the process. After you graduate or leave school, you can sell it if the market is up, and if it is down, just rent it out until it goes up then sell it, or hang onto it for whatever other purpose. Don't even worry about that yet though cause you aren't there yet. Revisit it when you are.\n\nThird, her burial expenses are not on you. It comes across as extremely disrespectful to try to dump that on you. But if you think your parents are going to drag you into litigation, you might consider a compromise. Perhaps offer to cover half, or some reasonable share (not more than half) out of the money from her estate, provided that does not require selling the house or leaving you without any money at your disposal. Consider your own needs before choosing a number. Also, this is not for the sake of paying for her expenses, it is a defensive measure to nip litigation with your parents in the bud, preventing unneccessary expense, stress, and souring your relationship with your family further. Lengthy court battles run a very high cost, and money is only part of that. Lost time, toll on your well being, frustration, distraction from other important things in your life, there's a lot of things being in a fierce court battle will cause that are painful aside from just finances. Run this by your lawyer before you ever bring it up with them, but the idea is that you can offer to chip in for the burial expenses within a reasonable amount provided they sign a legally binding agreement not to challenge the estate in court. If you proceed with this, get it signed in a legally binding way. If they go back on their word later, they will be liable for recouping whatever you offered to contribute. Otherwise that puts the whole threat of a court fiasco to rest permanently. Again, don't just trust a stranger on the internet, run it by your lawyer first and determine if it is a worthwhile  thing to pursue. Also bear in mind you don't even have to do this at all, it just may be a viable way to keep the peace and minimize complication moving forward.\n\nAgain sorry for your loss. But remember you did not do anything wrong, you are just caught up in a tragic chain of events. From the sounds of how you describe it, you are holding all the cards here. Don't just give them away for no reason. You were given a royal flush for a reason, play it for what it  is.",

It sounds like your sister was an incredibly driven & hard working individual, who cared for you deeply and wanted to do whatever she could to help you succeed.\n\n2nd (& a bit off topic)- if you're interested, I might suggest looking into your universities bereavement/family hardship policies.  While they won't change your grades for this semester, it's very possible that they will excuse you from the tuition you owe for this term.\n\nWhen my mother was suddenly diagnosed with a highly aggressive form of cancer, I skipped classes for weeks on end (either caring for her or just being generally distraught).  I also failed all my classes that term, but my university excused me from the respective tuition costs.  In my case the process was quite simple as well- 3 total emails to the counselor explaining the situation & a letter from my mother's doctor to confirm I wasn't making it up.  The counselor handled everything else with the registrar & financial aid behind the scenes.  I'm sure some wasted tuition money is the least of your concerns right now, but what you're going through falls well within the guidelines for most public universities & you are more than deserving of exemption should you choose to seek it.",

You are a beneficiary, and it seems as though your sister was really on top of things. I mean... To have you willed at her age is amazing. My advice? Don't worry about it too much. Stay in the home no matter what... Don't leave. And if your parents start harassing you, a restraining order may be necessary. It's horrendous what people turn in to in these situations. Just remember what the most important thing here is... Your SISTER'S wishes.",

If you sell the house, it suddenly becomes solely a monetary asset to your sister's estate. If you keep the house as your home, they will have a much weaker claim for it.\n\nThey're trying a soft approach but will likely try and take as much as they can get away with.",

Because the sub filled such an enormous unmet need for so many people, it has become an umbrella hub for a variety of difficulties caused by a psychologically unhealthy upbringing.  \n  \n The thing is, parents define our reality and kids always normalize how they are treated. It is worth lurking around to see if anything begins to sound familiar. It's a slow and confusing process to even grasp whether you belong there or not. You've mentioned a few things in a way that describes some classic family dysfunction in a casual way that is a very familiar thing for people over at [\"RBN\"](https://old.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists) \u2014 it's how a lot of us thought about our situations before we began to gain some clarity about our parents and ourselves.   \n  \nI can't say for sure, but I would guess there is a fair chance that your troubles as a teenager are unlikely to have been due to something intrinsically wrong with you. It seems more like a complicated response to some neglectful and abusive parenting. Sending you to a treatment clinic can also be interpreted as a tactic to reinforce the idea in your mind and the perception of others that there was something wrong with you, and nothing at all with them.   \n  \nThere is enormous empowerment from recognizing what is real and what isn't, because you can't effectively deal with problems when you're actively excusing the source that generates them. It just doesn't work if you spin your wheels trying to fix something in yourself that wasn't really ever broken, just mistreated.   \n  \nYour last edit indicates your father switched tactics and has looped you into something where you are waiting to hear more. People know when they don't legally hold the title to a house, and his explanation of his motive for trying to sell it may sound plausible to you, but not even slightly to me. I fear you are vulnerable and unprepared for ways that you can be manipulated now that you have something they want. But you can become familiar with patterns of manipulation through other people's stories, enough to recognize what's happening in your own family dynamic, and learn ways to protect yourself. Not just legally, but emotionally and cognitively.  \n\n  \nThe support at [RBN](https://reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists) can make the difference in your favor, and it has the best mods on Reddit, hands down. They keep the space safe for everyone, and help teach us all how to treat each other in a supportive way. Because \"fleas\" are a thing that you pick up without realizing and it takes work to shed them. You are a good person, I can tell, and good people care about how they affect others.",

I think it's better to keep low contact while you sort out your new situation. The part that hit me the hardest is that they had no issue taking your sister's stuff and leaving you dry even though they probably knew your sister was taking care of you. It's like someone leaving you their house and you throw their kids out. You say that they're not terrible, but that's a pretty terrible thing to do. Also, normal parents would have done for you what your sister did when you were a teenager. Be with you when it's hard and help you out of your problems, not just abandon you and then make you feel guilty about it. Nope, they were the shitty ones there too.\n\nEdit: I hope this makes sense, they got me rambling angrily.",

I hope you're able to find the time to grieve and recover yourself mentally/physically, but please listen to the comments about asking your lawyer for a recommended financial planner.

Clearly they only saw the money aspect of her passing and no thoughts about you or your circumstances, and sounds like they were ready to throw you asideSounds like your sister was very savvy about her estate and talked to an attorney looking out for your interests. Right now the attorney is the closest you have as a family representative. Trust and rely on them, just as your sister did when she set the estate up. Ask them questions and take their advice, as they have a legal obligation to represent you.  \n\nFrom your parents perspective if they spend a million dollars in lawyer's fees and come out just $1 from what's left of the estate,, they'll feel justified. \n\nGood luck, and sorry about your sister.",

That campus had a policy that if you withdrew medically (say, mental health concerns with documentation from a licensed healthcare provider) you were only on the hook for the tuition from the start of the semester through the last date of attendance. I know the place I worked also was flexible for when paperwork was due, typically before the start of the next semester. A 'W' on the transcript doesn't help or hurt your GPA, but may impact financial aid.\n\nThe other option is to withdraw before the deadline for a full semester withdraw (that date is typically on the school's academic calendar). That option doesn't help as much financially but at least helps your GPA.\n\nReadmission is typically a LOT easier as you don't have to re-apply like the first time you applied, but would instead complete readmission paperwork.\n\nSorry for what you've been through OP, but hope this helps.",

First please take good care of yourself, eat properly, take care of your pets, talk to your college, don\u2019t decide on anything right now. \n\nGrief, cry, be angry. Now is the best time. If you can get counseling be it college or private. \n\nSecond after few days contact college student union, counseling, dean office, lectures. Who ever you can trust. Many colleges will have systems in place to postpone examination/ assignments to a later date. When my close family died pre Covid I was given exemptions and provided with free exam 2 months later. The semester is still not over means you can still redo a lot of work without need to repeat a semester. \n\nDon\u2019t tell anyone about the money. Not friends, family, bfs/ gfs or future people. If they ask about your house explain it was willed nothing more. It will save you a lot of trouble when people will try taking advantage of you. \n\nAfter you figure out college and mange to get through initial grief you can start to think what next. I know it seems like the pain will never go but it will. I recommend moving to a room that has east light (morning light). Don\u2019t close the blinds let the morning light annoy you to get out of bed. I know form experience that when you don\u2019t get a lot of morning light you will stay in bed longer. Don\u2019t throw anything, don\u2019t go to your sister room just yet (unless you think there\u2019s something that will rot or/and die there then go quickly take everything and close the door) \n\nTake some time and when your ready fallow the advice of fellow redditors. Get lawyer and financial advice what to do with the money and how best save it. If you plan on giving any furniture, cloths or personal object never say it\u2019s for free. Give objects a 20/30\u20ac charge and when someone ask about it then say its free. You will avoid a lot of r/choosingbeggers \n\nAnd again get a counseling help asp. You don\u2019t have family to grief with and depend on. A food Counselor will be able to help you work though it. And if you need anyone to talk feel free to DM me.",

The only way I can see a court allowing their claim is if they argued that the parents provided them a loan that they intended to be paid back (and was not a unconditional gift to their daughter). They can use a portion of the will to satisfy this loan. I don't know any lawyer in their right mind who would help your parents bring a suit unless they want to just take money from your parents via billables (which is pretty unethical imo).",

      "text": "I notice most are saying that your parents are SOL and will lose the suit. I felt like I should add a bit to that.\n\nPeople sue for money they don't deserve or have an actual claim to *all the time.* Sometimes they win. They are exceedingly unlikely to be able to take everything from you, but winning things like reimbursement of funeral expenses from the estate wouldn't surprise me.\n\nIf they can come up with \"debts\" you or your sister \"owe\", and back them up at all, there is also some chance of claiming more. Just as an example, if they say you borrowed their car in 2010 and got in a fender bender, and then failed to pay for it, I've seen cases where parents have won judgements on that basis. \n\nSo, if they start making claims you know they can't back up, *don't admit that the claims are true even if they are.* Again, that's claims they can't back up. Obviously if, in that hypothetical situation, there were a corresponding police report showing that you damaged their car, you'd have to own up to it.\n\nThe reason I say not to admit even if true is that if there were some claim like that, but you DID pay it back, it can be hard to prove that, but your admitting to it is sufficient proof that the debt was incurred.\n\nAlso in their favor, if true, is that they were left nothing at all. If an estate is large, it's generally best practice to leave a token amount (think $1000 not $1) to anyone you wish to disinherit. Sometimes families fight, then patch things up again, but a will can be written while the fight was ongoing and then never changed.\n\nSome judges can even be persuaded that, in a will which mentions multiple family members but leaves others out entirely, someone may have been overlooked by mistake. I would think those cases unlikely in your case, if your sister specifically used language that stated that you got everything.\n\nIf her will predates her knowledge of her condition or its deterioration, they might claim she assumed she'd outlive them, and left them out entirely for that reason.\n\nThe long and short of it is: don't worry yourself to death (especially if the will is recent), but take it seriously. Gather any evidence you can that your sister was NC with your parents or otherwise inclined to disinherit them. Even if it's just text messages or emails between the two of you, make the effort.",

One of the easiest ways to doing that is setting up a trust for all of the assets that you now have and include a good lawyer that can advise you on protecting you, and that which has been left to you by your sister.  A good place to start could be looking into an asset Trust or equivalent in your country - it kind of ring fences and protects what you have legally and prevents interference from other parties besides other benefits.  Do this before you get into any legal entanglements.",

Also just to put in perspective how crazy this is, and the story the judge will be hearing:\n\nThese parents lose a child\nThe parents paid for funeral arrangements \nThe parents find out their youngest was willed in\nThe parents want to sue their youngest kin\n\nWhat a terrible look for them. Good luck, you\u2019ve nothing to worry about, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll go NC after this and hopefully when this mess is overwith you can properly grieve the loss of your big sis.",

This way your GPA won\u2019t take a hit.\n\nSources: I had a friend in college whose father passed suddenly. He failed his finals and took a leave of absence for a semester. The school allowed him to retake the finals when he returned and credited him the semester he had just paid for but couldn\u2019t attend.\n\nMy mother went through a cancer scare and my Aunt was actually diagnosed with cancer, both at the same time. I was unable to focus during a Master\u2019s semester and had my grades dropped due to emotional distress.\n\nCheck with your school.

The only way they would have a case for any claim on the estate is if they loaned her money that was never repaid.",

Not only would it be in keeping with her wishes, it would also piss off your parents that you're giving some of that money away.",

This lets the probate court know that your sister clearly intended to disinherit them. But stick to your guns.

If anyone at university or beyond brings up failed classes, once they know what you\u2019ve gone through it will not matter. I promise you that. \n\nSecond, I am so very sorry for the absolute shit parents you were dealt. Thank god for your sister raising you and showing you how to be a kind and empathetic adult. You were so smart to have an attorney ready, now let him do his job. You should not worry about losing the house, that part of the lawsuit should be very straight forward and will in ALL likelihood be ruled in your favor. Who knows if they will be able to get any money that they spent on the funeral. But it\u2019s hard to imagine the ruling to be a poor college student give up money to his \u201clower upper class\u201d parents.\n\nI don\u2019t know you or your family, but I can say will full confidence your parents are horrible people, and do not deserve the privilege of you as a child. You should completely sever ties, and focus on your friendships. Just because you don\u2019t share the same genes with someone doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be their family. \n\nI wish you the best of luck through this and in the future.

I hope that you make it through this ordeal with your sanity intact and your rightful assets in hand.\n\nTax day was Monday. You said that your sister passed six months ago, but I'm not sure when the assets transferred to you. Hopefully your attorney has advised you to hire a qualified accountant/financial advisor to help you maximize the value of your assets while minimizing your liabilities. Similar to having an attorney, having a financial professional can put some distance between your emotions and the big decisions that you will have to make about your assets.\n\nBest of luck to you with college, with dealing with your grief, and with cutting your obviously toxic parents out of your life.",

Case in point that she had you inherit her home and not your parents. Instead take all the wonderful and good memories you have of her and try to do them right. And you do them right not by punishing yourself for who you are, but by becoming what she always wanted you to be: happy, self-sufficient and most importantly, a good person.\n\nAs for the whole housing situation, don't make the same mistake i did when i inherited. Which was selling everything as fast as possible (granted anger played a huge part in it), and spend it for easy pleasures. You're very likely from a wholly different country than I based on the loan bits, but really try to take that gift your sister left you and make the best of it. You say you are a student, then turn that house into an awesome space for other students just like yourself. You'll not just make valuable money on the side, but potentially make friendships for life. The very least you'll be able to make the situation a bit easier on someone going through the same shit.\n\nYour sister wanted you to lead a good life above everything. Don't ever put yourself down over your own perceived flaws, your sister wouldn't have cared as long as you were able to lead a fulfilled life. Instead take that immeasurable kindness she always extended you and hand just a bit of it back to other people in similar situations. \n\nAlso: Fuck your greedy parents. They are leeches trying to feed of the situation. You are better than them, and so was your sister, thats the reaseon she raised you and left her possessions to you. Because you are worth every damn bit.",

I wished I could give all of it back or away if it meant having my dad back, and I\u2019m sure you feel a similar way right now.

I hope all has been going well... it must be very difficult having to deal with the loss of your sister as well as terrible parents like this who rather than be happy for you and behave like decent human beings... well yeah.... I have a friend going through something very similar :(\n\nFirst off... only echoing what everyone is saying but in relation to the teachers and marks hurt by the loss of a family member and grief just go right over their heads to the proper authority of the matter and it should work out. If the teacher/s decides to get vindictive/spiteful about this and you feel discriminated towards in terms of their marking or behaviour make sure to keep as much evidence and records as possible.\n\nSecond, i'd definitely get some legal advice with the money that was left for you about the possible incoming lawsuit as I am pretty sure they can't sue you for this since your sister can leave her estate and money to whoever she wants and that is just how it is. If your parents were not in the picture and had no say or name on the will then... well good luck to them. And of course but a different and positive kind of good luck! :D",

They obviously allowed themselves to be distant and are in shock about how they blew it, so they\u2019re putting a lot of their emotional burden onto you.  I think paying for part of the funeral cost is fair, such as splitting the cost is fair.  But, to expect more simply because your sister willed everything to you is the idea that they\u2019re entitled just because they brought you both into the world. \n\nNobody owes anything to their parents, because nobody asked to be born.  However, if parents have been emotionally, morally and financially supportive for the right reasons, then I can see a kid growing to adulthood, actually caring to be there for their parents in return.

Attorneys confirmed that what\u2019s in the will is almost always final. It can be challenged, but only if specific circumstances exist, and there has to be evidence. (Such as tampering with the will, unjust coercion of the estate holder to make changes soon before they died, etc.) and that it\u2019s rare for a challenger to win a case against a will, plus they have to be willing to pay hefty court and attorney fees to do so.

With my best friend I was left everything, had the legacy rights to everything\u2026 To plan some thing like that is awful number one, and number two\u2026 I saw firsthand how malicious people can be & greedy. Just remember that you are grieving\u2026 And maybe try to ask for some help about locking it in some kind of trust to ensure that it becomes college housing for your sisters wishes or even if you sold it put away a portion for what she wants and that\u2019s all that I suggest to do besides try to honor the other wishes of her parents like.. Besides $Gains if that makes sense\u2026 in my case didn\u2019t take any ashes because penguins father believed if they were separated it was bad\u2026 even though having her ashes was special to me because of a morbid inside joke\u2026But her mother had them and would not give the whole box to her father\u2026 parents were at such odds the dad told me that he wouldn\u2019t even be attending the memorial that I prepared out of state at one point..After I paid to rent a private ranch to have a more intimate gathering anyway\u2026 Whatever. I guess the only thing I need to say to everybody who reads this, is make sure you get a Will, a real signed copy to an executor. just like his sister did\u2026their wishes are very clear\u2026  I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to deal with this. Two things are sure in this life we are all born to people that we cannot choose, and we are all born to die. Wills and all the stuff about final wishes should not be so taboo and sad. Seems like funerals and deaths just cause so much tension with things and it should just be such a huge celebration and remembrance\u2026 I mean I know that I cry, And I\u2019m definitely will it be in motion\u2026 but it\u2019s more for just really not understanding how people could be so ugly when all I wanted was to include everyone you know.\n\nThe judge who is ethical would not force you to give them anything that was monetary gain, though setting herself up so well I\u2019m surprised that her funeral expenses wouldn\u2019t be already set aside. I don\u2019t say that to be insensitive, I\u2019m just saying now I really want to make sure that\u2019s the first thing I set up.",

      "text": "As for school you can always withdraw from your classes. A withdraw will show on your transcript but doesn't affect your GPA. So there's that. Withdrawing can impact your financial aid though so be aware of that, and talk to a financial aid counselor about your options. If you're taking above 12 credits and withdrawing keeps you above that threshold you shouldn't lose any aid. Also 12 credits is just common to be considered full time, but reach school is different, so again, consult with your financial aid office.\n\nIf you're past the deadline to withdraw you should still be able to withdraw by appeal, usually to your department chair, but again, this process can vary. I think the university I used to work at just moved to an online withdraw appeal process. But anyway, for an appeal they are usually looking for hardship, so medical issues or loss of a loved one. In your case loss of a loved one is an absolutely valid reason to withdraw via appeal! \n\nWhen I was in school I wish I'd taken a withdraw, it would have massively helped my GPA. You're still out the money, but academically it can help. That said if you don't care about that or you'd lose your loans maybe not the best for you. But just know you have options and if you know you're going to fail that might be a good way to go. As always keep your professors in the loop, and they can help you too. If the whole semester is a wash withdrawing might be a good option though. But yeah, you'll lose your loans, and you can likely appeal for a tuition refund (citing loss of a loved one and withdrawing from classes) but that can be a hassle too. But you have a pretty good reason and even past deadlines there are usually appeals you can make. Not that you'll be approved per se, but they usually look for a good reason for the cases they approve, and your case is a good one.\n\nReach out to your advisor and your financial aid department, they can help you figure out what's best for your case. If you think you can pull through then that's always a good place to be too since you've already put in the work. \n\nAs far as your parents, sorry to hear, that's sucks. Seems like whenever a large sum of money is on the line family and friends turn into bitter rivals and enemies. It's like seeing dollar signs makes people go crazy. Seems like your parents are going to have a tough case, but still, hope things work out in the long run!",

When I went through this, my attorney repeatedly told me that nobody is entitled to an inheritance.  A person may feel like they should get an inheritance, but unless it is written into the will or trust, feelings mean nothing.\n\n\\- When my dad died, I wound up with the house he owned.  I'm an only child.  My parents had been divorced since I was an adult.  My parents had bought the house together and fixed it up from a shack into a nice place.  My mom had been a stay at home mom.  I know that they had settled the house during the divorce, but it didn't seem right to me that my mom got no part of it when my dad died, so when I sold the house, I gave my mom some of the money.  She was very grateful for that.  You may consider doing that for your parents.  However, this is a very very personal decision and is completely up to you.  For me it was the right thing to do, but not really knowing anything about your family, it may or may not be appropriate for you.\n\n\\- I have gone through this for both my parents, and several times on my wife's side.

When it comes to money and inheritance, family can become monsters. When my mom passed, my dad \u2014 who had divorced her years prior \u2014 got really weird because he thought that the money she had gotten from the divorce would return to him instead of going to us kids. Later he cut us out of his will over it and has decided that when it\u2019s his time, everything will be left to his other family from after the divorce. People will try to take advantage of the fact that you\u2019re a kind, good hearted person. Don\u2019t let them; your sister wanted to provide for YOUR future. Not your parents\u2019.\n\nI highly recommend changing the locks. Don\u2019t listen about selling the house due to the market \u2014 it sounds like your sister was savvy and her plans will likely keep you well situated for now. Cover the costs that your sister\u2019s estate may have normally paid for burial and memorial, and then return to your previous low contact with your parents. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this. Regardless of your grades, I bet your sister would be proud of how you\u2019ve dealt with this and stood up for yourself so far.",

I saw a grief counselor when my dad died unexpectedly, and she really helped me. \n\nThere\u2019s also rental management companies who will take on all the responsibilities of being a landlord.

I think she set up some of the rental properties for you in case she got sick from her heart problems or died. That\u2019s what I would do. I have health problems and have a large insurance policy that would pay for my medical bills and give my husband enough money so he could take a sabbatical from work. \n\nShe wants you to thrive and do your own thing.

Had that happened already, your parents would be notified because, while they are not in the will, they are the \"intestate\" heirs (they would have gotten the assets if there was no will). Intestate heirs are notified so that they have an opportunity to object/challenge the will. So either the will has not been probated yet (in which case they came to the reasonable conclusion that there was no will and they'd get everything) or it is being probated but your lawyer messed up and didn't notify your parents. Either way, not being transparent can lead to will challenges as people feel like there must be something shady going on and there's no other way to get the real information. You're a bit of an AH for failing to let them know, and for failing to pay them back for the funeral costs. Regardless of what other posters say, that is an obligation of the Estate and it sounds like you have more than enough funds in the Estate to do so.\n\nYour parents sound like AHs generally, and certainly how they've reacted to your sister's death, how they've spoken to and about you, qualifies them as AHs.",

You have some textbook narcs on your hands, and they get thirsty around money.\n\nYour situation is nearly 100% comparable to my girlfriend's current situation.

Burn the playbook!",
