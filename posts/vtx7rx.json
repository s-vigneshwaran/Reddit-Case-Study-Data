They would likely support a law policy that said you must work X amount of hours to get aid because they believe the current system is mostly people living off the government while they are working and struggling to get by. Same with abortions. They picture a typical person getting one to be a young woman using it as a BC method and sleeping with 10 guys. They are totally unaware that that isn\u2019t the case.

Then the blue cities in red states, which would see a massive drain, like Houston, Philly, Miami, Austin, San Antonio, DFW, Columbus, Cincy, Cleveland, Indianapolis, Louisville, Phoenix, Pittsburgh, Orlando, Detroit, New Orleans, Montgomery, Raleigh, Charleston would compound the issue further.

They either get their information from disreputable sources like faux news, or their church(who also got it from faux news). Both of these actively discourage seeking information elsewhere, *by design*. And so you have these insular pockets of rural communities who, *may* have internet, but if no one has sat down with them prior to indoctrination, has no idea how to effectively search info that may offer a different viewpoint. To the contrary, they\u2019re told not to. I\u2019m not giving them a pass, but writing it off as they intended to do this without a system of propaganda fucking them over is disingenuous and othering. As much as I dislike them for their stances, there are a good deal of them that simply don\u2019t know better and have been made to not be able to know better.",

With the red states, it's not just ignorance (which has many origins) but a festering tribalist and nationalist identity (again, reinforced by their misinformation) but it makes dialogue nearly impossible. I'll say I've had more eye opening conversations with people from coal towns in WV and farms in west Texas, people who truly just want a better life for their families and have been led to think that comes by voting R, but for every sane person I've spoken to like that, there are about 100 that are just looking for an enemy and have found it with the people who are trying to make their lives better, but they can't get over the fact those same people don't hate gay people or black people.",

Of course within short spans of history one side gains more control than the other but on the hole it balances out in favor of progress. Slow progress seem to be an evolutionarily advantage.\n\nSame think can be said of risk taking and risk aversion, we need both the solid rock that will tend to same stable drop every single year and the maverick looking for a new improved crop taking the risk of having nothing at the end of each year.\n\nConservatives are built to be our brakes but often go too far until the pendulum brings it back into balance.",

Not particularly democratic by our modern standards, no, but from what I understand they still signified significant steps forward in the pursuit of the ideal republic (and to be clear, while the USA has taken some steps towards that, at times, we are far from an ideal republic, as is probably every nation on earth right now).\n\nI'm just relating the common dictionary definition of Republic and you're getting upset. Why would that upset you?\n\nVenice, from encyclopedia.com:\n\n>doges held office not because of the grace of divine right\u2014as did emperors and popes, and by extension the princes and other elites who ruled territories allied with the Roman, Byzantine, and Carolingian empires\u2014but by trust of the popolo (people).",

Like both REPUBLICS of China, for a while, the people\u2019s still being one. Like all the Latin American republics that were dictatorships. Or the African ones. Or the Asian ones. Or the Mediterranean ones. Hell, the third fucking reich was a dictatorial republic! \n\n\n[From Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic).\n\nNotice how there are three definitions, well the last one doesn\u2019t matter, so let\u2019s focus on these two and they\u2019re respective sub definitions.\n\nThe first one is today the most commonly used. That definition specifically calls out a monarch, so I don\u2019t think I have to point out anything.\n\nThe second definition is a bit more complex. On this definition, most (though not all) dictatorships wouldn\u2019t be considered republics, however, neither would monarchies, again, because \u201csupreme power to the citizens\u201d contradicts having a monarch unless they have absolutely, undoubtedly, no power at all, which, though theoretically possible, doesn\u2019t exist today and probably will never. \n\nBy both definitions, monarchies are not republics, obviously.\n\nDictatorships can, according to one, and cannot, according to the other, be republics. And that\u2019s not because of representatives, most dictatorships were/are representative in some way, so, if we simply went by the use of representatives, they\u2019d still be republics.\n\nFurthermore, the second definition wouldn\u2019t make sense in some cases, since not all republics throughout history were representative and/or democratic. Direct democracies are republics and merchant republics are\u2026 republics.\n\nHonestly I\u2019m including the second definition here to prove however you look at it, monarchies aren\u2019t republics. I don\u2019t agree with that definition, as it is contradictory of history, but whatever.",

The republicans represent a sentiment of keeping things the same and democrats representing creating change. The combination of ignorance and keeping a status quo is more easily integrated into the Republican Party. However the ignorance and enacting change becomes harder to integrate as the radical ideas will threaten political stability, and while the democrats align with change the system can only handle so much. Therefor your left is perceived as compartmentalized and the right united. While the actual politics of the two parties from the outside are relatively centered, the perception is that one side is a representative of an extremist group, when in reality that is not the case. \nApologies for any mistakes in my language.",

              "text": "So I see where you\u2019re coming from but your perspective is being very naive. There have been major social and political shifts in America the past thirty years. There has been an active campaign against education in the southern states, states that consistently vote Republican. Republicans literally and vocally dislike higher education because it\u2019s \u201cliberal brain washing.\u201d Something like 90% of people who go to college are democrats. Beyond that, the red states are the ones who refuse to teach their kids about slavery and black oppression. They actively work to keep them uneducated. Those red states come in worst in public education year after year after year. \n\nThey also are the states that use the most social net programs (welfare, disability, food stamps etc.) that the blue states pay into the most( federally) and get the least use out of by blue states. Yet, those bottom red states are chock full of idiots who think only criminals and welfare queens use the program they depend on. Republicans are the political party that constantly votes against themselves and the reason why is because they literally work to keep their voters uneducated so they don\u2019t recognize when they are being played. That doesn\u2019t even get into the after math of dumbing down their base twenty years ago, which is why you see conspiracy nuts like  MTG and idiots like Lauren Boeburt as new wave republicans, who are their predecessors. \n\nSo to recap, not only do republicans openly have distain for higher education (the term \u201cwoke\u201d that they use so often now to describe things they don\u2019t like actually means to be enlightened) they actively work to keep their voting base uneducated and therefore more easily fooled so they can continue to vote against themselves. This means when the politicians in power are paid off to vote against their constituents, the uneducated not only don\u2019t get upset, they cheer them on, completely lacking the awareness of their own situation. So, in America, the least educated you are, the more likely you are to be a Republican. This isn\u2019t bi-partition banter, it\u2019s statistically proven facts and I can pull you some sources if you like, though they are easily googled. Watch videos of a trump rally crowd and that should be all the proof you need.",

Of course we see color. How could we not notice someone's skin color. But by claiming colorblindness you are attempting to opt out of any further reflection about unconscious bias you might have, and by extension are shutting down the entire conversation and preserving a status quo that benefits white people specifically.\n\nThere's a lot more. Anyways, I encourage you to open your mind and read up some more. Accept that you have some ideas that you need to explore more.\n\nRegarding standards, since u know you are still bristling at that, they can be racist and have a history of racism. Here's how it worked in the past: the black community was largely illiterate immediately after emancipation (for obvious reasons). So voting laws required a **standard** literacy test. But that automatically excluded most black folks, because as we mentioned, the standard was set above their ability from the start. \n\nThese sorts of practices continue today. Many black folks have a harder time attending college, but many jobs might require a college degree, even if the job absolutely doesn't need it. This excludes black folks from the jump, l while seeming fair. \n\nJust because you use the word standard doesn't mean it is such.",

The concept of merit, rationality, objective fact, and the scientific process are not racist. I am familiar with critical theory literature, and I know the book you are speaking of, *and it is the heart of evil masquerading as benevolent compassion.*\n\n>I would be willing to bet you say stuff like, 'i don't see color I just see people'.\n\nI don't see people, I hear them. I don't care what you look like, not one iota, what I care about is speech.\n\n>Well, that's bullshit. Of course we see color. How could we not notice someone's skin color...\n\nYeah, so you prescribed a quote to me and then spent an entire paragraph addressing this straw man you built. What a joke.\n\n>Here's how it worked in the past: the black community was largely illiterate immediately after emancipation\n\nMy literal point was that standards are attacked as racist simply for existing. You are not speaking to that, you are simply providing historical examples of standards being misused.\n\nStandards are not inherently racist. Period.\n\n>These sorts of practices continue today. Many black folks have a harder time attending college,\n\nNot because of their color, but because of their socioeconomic status. Also, affirmative action, have you heard of it?\n\n>Just because you use the word standard doesn't mean it is such.\n\nThere it is, baseless accusations of racism simply for saying that we should have standards will get you called a racist.",

You are not listening.\n\nObjective facts are facts, but they are often used specifically to preserve the racist status quo.\n\n>Not because of their color, but because of their socioeconomic status.\n\nYou are so close to getting it. Just think it thru a bit more.\n\nIf I was a slave, and then I was freed, I have no money, no education, no assets. But all the white people around me do have some of those things..so I am already at a disadvantage right out the gate.\n\nNow, you are gonna say, whatever that was hundreds of years ago.\n\nNo. As recently as the 1980s banks were more likely to lend to low income white people than high income black people (source: the color of money, 1989 Pulitzer prize winning investigative reporting).\n\nThis means that racism and socioeconomic status are highly intertwined. Thus, when you say you not because of their color but their socioeconomic status, you are not really saying two different things. You *feel* like you are removing race from the equation, but you aren't.\n\nIn a perfect world, yes, we would remove race and just use economic status, but we don't live in a perfect world. Relying on something like that simply preserves the past bigotry. But we want to break that cycle.\n\nYou seem to think that I want to do away with facts. That's not true. Not even slightly.\n\nWhat I want is to recognize the *full context of those facts.* That means recognizing that someone's education level may have been impacted negatively by their race. So, if I am for example hiring for a job, how can I evaluate the applicants skill level for that job without over relying on things that have been skewed due to legacy effects of race.\n\nYou really should read that book. You are a classic example of everything about whiteness that preserves the status quo of racist outcomes all while appearing to be not racist.\n\nI am not calling you racist, btw. I am saying there is a bunch of racist behavior that you do not yet recognize, and you commit some of it. I know because I am also a white dude who used to sound just like you.",

Racism is all but dead in America today, and those that continue to make accusations have chased the ghost into our psyches and make baseless claims of foundational rot, all of which is nothing short of counterproductive at best.\n\nYou are doing much more and effective work perpetuating racism in America today than white supremacists, and you have none of my respect because of it, just as I have none for them.",

They declared that you cannot sue if a border patrol agent breaks into your house without a warrant. This doesn't technically allow border patrol to break in, but it means that border patrol cannot be punished externally for it. That is a huge violation of the 4th amendment, and the concept of separation of power. There is no check to balance out the power of the border patrol anymore, meaning the judicial branch lost a huge amount of control over the executive branch, and sets a dangerous precedent for further stripping of accountability of law enforcement.\n\nI would rather be forced to take a vaccine than have my privacy and home invaded by a tyrannical government.",

This means that if they see a bill being drafted, they can publicly announce that they WILL overturn it if challenged. All it takes is one person to get charged under that law, and they can escalate it to the Supreme Court. The GOP can even provide legal fees to expedite its escalation to the Supreme Court, at which point they will strike it down. A Supreme Court that falls in line with partisan interests gives that party the power to basically pass the bill, then immediately toss it to the Court to kill it.

If it was the Dems who killed net neutrality, they realized their mistake and undid it. However, it was actually conservatives that killed it. Net Neutrality rules were set up by the Democratic Obama administration in 2015. The FCC voted 2-3 to repeal those changes in 2017. Guess what, all 3 republican commisioners voted to repeal net neutrality, while both democrats voted to keep them. If you could show me how Democrats attacked net neutrality, I would love to see some evidence.\n\nSecondly, while the Supreme Court did not invade privacy, they voted that we have no right to privacy. They did not violate our rights, they removed them, and that is a huge distinction that you seem to have glossed over.",
