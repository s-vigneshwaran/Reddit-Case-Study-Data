But clearly their policy is not that well defined as the guy flip flops between it being just the shorts and then the shirt and shorts. He doesn\u2019t have a clear understanding of what the policy is either bc he doesn\u2019t know or it\u2019s subjective or both. \n\nThere\u2019s now way you can tell what kind of fabric the white kids shorts are from a video that far away. And even if you could, it\u2019s to justify your definition of athletic, which is probably more defined than the restaurants policy AND is still also subjective as you could say a shirt is athletic because it has an athlete on it. Different definition but equally plausible if not moreso. You don\u2019t have the facts to make that argument and the employee can\u2019t give a straight answer so just no.",

I feel like we should only focus on the boys shorts though just to make it easier for discussion purposes because I do agree both their shirts were very similar so there\u2019s not much of a difference there. But the shorts in my opinion are very different from each other. The white kids seem like they could easily pass for something non athletic and more casual. You even said it yourself at the end of your last comment that the \u201cwhite child clearly had on casual wear\u201d. That\u2019s my point. The dress code is casual wear, not athletic wear. The white kids pants can pass for non athletic casual wear while the black kids can\u2019t. Couldn\u2019t that easily be why the host let the white family in? I mean if both kids had on the same shorts I\u2019d be saying the same thing as you but they seem very different to me, and if I was a host I could totally see myself  bending the rules a little and letting the white kid in, but I don\u2019t think I could let in the basketball shorts the black kid had on. Doesn\u2019t that make sense? Why assume the host was being racist when there\u2019s such a big difference in there attire?",

The mother then points out that the white kid who was outside eating at that restaurant wore practically the same clothes as her child.\n\nThe \u201cracism\u201d is the fact that the white kid got to eat at the restaurant, and the black kid wasn\u2019t able to. The guy at the front says it\u2019s \u201cdress code\u201d but the 2 kids literally are wearing the same thing, so the guy is tryna use it as an excuse to prevent this black kid from eating at that place because he\u2019s black. \n\nHopefully you see that this video is basically segregation as back in the early 1900s but more disguised. 2 people, who are wearing the same thing, just different skin colors, and one person gets the right to eat at this place and the other one gets declined. If you don\u2019t think this is racism something is wrong with you man.\n\nAnd please save the bullshit about how applying racism to possibly non-racist topics are the reason we are divided. In this country, any average person can tell what\u2019s racist and what\u2019s not. It\u2019s not rocket science. Especially take it from the many of us who actually encounter racism every single day.\n\nEdit: About your point with how the shorts are a bit different, that\u2019s not the only important part. The guy\u2019s expression when the black kid\u2019s mom pointed out the white kid is super ignorant. He knows he\u2019s wrong but he still tries to insist that \u201cdress code\u201d is the problem and continues to push them away, whilst continuing to tell them that \u201cI understand you\u201d in order to try to get on their good side and avoid them completely. This also raises a huge red flag and further confirms that this is definitely racism.",

But I really disagree that that\u2019s how \u201cpeople always think\u201d and maybe that\u2019s where the issue lies. \n\nThis is why I think it was not racist: because I could see myself doing the same exact thing as the host, and I know I\u2019m not a racist person. I can see how the host might let the first kid in based of his dress but not the second. If I was in his position I might have done the same thing, but that wouldn\u2019t make me racist right?\n\nI\u2019ll put it this way: I truly believe I\u2019m not racist in any way and treat everyone equally. If I was in that hosts position I might have done the same thing. Would you call me a racist because of that?",

The guy acting how he does is just the \u201chow\u201d, I assumed that this guy was racist because I\u2019ve seen it before in those videos and made a connection here. And so has many other reddit users. \n\nI still feel like the guy should\u2019ve actually tried to get his point across, because I feel like he\u2019s mainly tryna push the people away and avoid everything.

Of course it was only all you can eat on the premises.  A family was near the end of the party and ordered 2 or 3 more pizzas.  The employees helping the party made them and then they got me when they saw the family just receive the pizzas and started to pack up their stuff to go, no intention of ever eating a slice of it at the party.  I was totally floored and didn\u2019t let them take it due to policy.  I was polite like the kid in the video but was also totally wrong.  The pizzas were made so the money was already lost and I turned a happy customer into an angry one.  My sense of justice didn\u2019t last long.  Seeing them storm out I already knew I made the wrong call.",

Just because the white kid was admitted by error does not give the other kid a right to also be let in by error.\n\nExcept this is the completely wrong thing to do in this circumstance. The right way to do it is accept that it was YOUR error and let the other kid in.\n\n>You are therefore the racist for trying to make a non-racial issue about race. All this does is devalue actual racism and water down the terms. Shame on you.\n\nBut it really doesn't. There is a white kid in the restaurant wearing nearly identical clothing to a black kid who isn't being let in because he violates the dress code. Regardless of the intention behind it, it LOOKs like textbook racism, like a child could tell you it's racist. If it's shameful to call this racist, than the only charitable take on it is the guy is almost unemployably stupid.\n\nIn fact it's so racist LOOKING that it is really concerning that the employee doesn't realize that, and isn't trying to find a way to salvage the situation. The whole damn thing is being recorded.",

He told me about a night when Young Jeezy (this was like 07 when he was at his peak) came to the club he worked at and how the manager had him and like 15 guys all come in the VIP entrance.  No pat downs no nothing.  \n\n\n*\nIf a place has a dress code you can guarantee with near certainty that it's going to be used for discrimination at their discretion.  \n\n**it wasn't actually funny he felt terrible but he was also a broke college kid that was large (6'7 ~300lbs) so he had the size/look of a bouncer and they paid better than any hourly job at the mall.*",

I have been to restaurants where we are spending thousands of dollars on Michelin star rated food wearing jeans because we had the money, and good attitudes. \n\nAny club's dress codes should solely be for safety, for example, dance clubs you should not have sandals on because of foot injuries due to glass on the floor, or being stepped or whatever. Or if you are in a beach town and dont want wet suits etc in your place while sitting on your furniture type situation.\n\nAnything else is the bar or club or restaurant being scared that the product they serve is not good enough so they need to try to make themselves look more exclusive. there is no other reason besides that to have a dress code.",

He was a big shot basketball player locally and had recently been drafted for the NBA and so people kept approaching him, dabbing him up etc, then when it comes time for entry he\u2019s denied because he had Jordan\u2019s on. He was dressed nicer than alllll the white kids in there who were also half wearing Jordan\u2019s. They pulled this a lot, selectively enforcing a dress code when they wanted to bar entry for other, racial reasons. Such BS. \n\n\nThis was one of like 3 drinking establishments in town and the only bar with any scene. The city over has a big bar scene. The establishment was 100000% trying to push black patrons to the city next door. So gross. \n\n\n\nI always hated Sunset Ribs",

We spent our evenings meeting people outside, waiting. Some who would stay with us and leave without ever seeing the inside, and others who would disappear into the club despite being dressed similarly or even more casual than us! We were wearing very nice looking suits, and kept ourselves fashionable and hip. Eventually we looked forward to going to the club. Not because we wanted in, but because of the great time we had outside with the others in line! So we came up with our own idea for a club - we are going to make a club where when you're outside waiting in line, it looks like the inside of a club. But when you get in? It looks like the outside, with like palm trees and street elements and stuff. We even got an investor interest in it one night when we finally got into the club. Sadly, we couldn't reach him again when we tried. His assistant was blocking us at every turn. \n\nWe're still determined to open that club though, because it sure beats delivering flowers for our dad's shop.",

Same with friends at movie theaters. Some can\u2019t shut up when it\u2019s time to watch the damn movie. Some of them are black, some of them are white. I know my black friends odds of not getting sideways glances and dealing with white paranoia is less when I\u2019m around. I know my odds of not getting jacked or messed with in their hood is better when they\u2019re around. You better believe this is all a two way street. It\u2019d be nice if people could just turn down the intensity on this shit. And this lady obviously felt this was all race related and l doubt it actually was. Most likely the same person who seated the white kid wasn\u2019t up front when this lady showed up with her son. Shift change, or whatever. Some don\u2019t enforce those policies in the afternoon, but do in the evening.  Either way the restaraunt looks nice, so there are multiple possibilities. But she went straight to the race card. And then embarrassed her son on top of it. Instead of having an adult conversation, she went all in on race. Loudly. This happens way to much. The dumb ass assistant manager obviously didn\u2019t know how to handle the situation properly, but I\u2019m sure he was doing what he was trained. i expect this lady plays victim a lot. She has her camera at the ready and everything.",

However, racism can only be proven is if the person states that it was their motive and since most people who are racists don't want to be punished for it they won't do that.\n\nHere's the circumstantial evidence:\n\n1. Both children were both wearing the same types of clothing\n2. The family with the child that was allowed in is white, the family that wasn't was black\n3. The mother made him aware that the other family was let in, offered video evidence, and clearly explained her argument in a relatively calm fashion\n\nHere's the possible reasons for his action:\n\n1. Racism\n2. It was a mistake by him or someone else to let the other family in but he wanted to enforce the rules\n3. He didn't understand the situation, her argument, or what it implies due to stress, ignorance, or both.\n4. He was doing his bosses bidding and had no choice\n\n\\[2\\] Considering how race/racism is at the forefront of American zeitgeist for the last two years I'm surprised he wouldn't think how bad this looks. Not to mention how little of an impact allowing a family where only one person is violating the dress code would have on the restaurant.\n\n\\[3\\] If he was under stress then he wasn't showing it, though I admit some people react that way. High-end restaurants are fast paced and stressful being a manger of one means you have some experience. In fact, his job is to deal with situations like this, he isn't a waiter, he's the one they call when it escalates to this situation.\n\n\\[3\\] The family explained the situation clearly even offering to provide evidence. They also remained calm throughout though filming someone could trigger a defensive position.\n\n\\[4\\] If was just doing his bosses bidding why didn't he go back to his boss for further instructions after being presented with evidence of the inconsistency. If there was another person on site higher in the chain why didn't he have them come out to talk to the family.\n\nPeople tend to think that this can't be racism because then the manager would have to be thinking \"I don't like black people, they are low class, I don't want them in this restaurant so I'll find a reason. I don't think this is true in most cases.\n\nThere is also unconscious bias. When you see a white boy dressed in a tee-shirt, shorts, and sneakers he might think back to your childhood and your friends. You see your past in that person and it feels comfortable. When you see a black boy dressed similarly your mind thinks things like ghetto, danger, or trouble. When there is a judgement call to be made it pulls you to one side.\n\nIn my opinion unconscious bias is likely the cause of this, however as I mentioned above how could he not realize the implications of his actions.  \n\nI do hope he didn't lose his job but the family is owed an apology and the manager needs training, assuming this is the first type of incident.",

You could also investigate their social media to look for clues, that's been done a lot. You could talk to their friends and family.\n\nI did not state that there are only two possibilities. I said, \"...or it could be genuine error to stress or a busy day or something else.\" Because I've worked in this kind of job before, I know how easy it is to miss details. The first kid might have been let in on accident because they could have been so busy at that point that no one even saw what he was wearing, and the second kid was stopped because it had become less busy by that point so they were slowing down and noticing more details. It could also have been a case of simply overlooking (or not looking at all) at the first kid. Like, they might have been having a conversation with the parents and literally not looking at the kid at all. Children do tend to be below our usual sight level, and details like that often go unnoticed.\n\nBut my point is that we can't prove it one way or another, at least without further investigation. *We cannot infer, from this video alone, whether this person was racist or acting with unconscious bias.*\n\nWhile that is definitely a possibility, there's nothing *in this video* that would cause us to infer that.\n\nEdit: I just watched the video for a third time to look for tell tale signs, and this guy even says, at the end, \"That shirt \\[referring to the white kid's t-shirt\\] didn't look like an athletic t-shirt to me, it looked like a regular shirt\". He's literally explaining that the first kid simply got unnoticed. This has nothing to do with them being white, and everything to do with them simply making a mistake and the other kid slipping in under the radar.",

I mean, truly formal dining would rather you simply didn't bring your kids, they're not really 'family' dining experiences to begin with. Because kids.\n\nBut srsly, I can't think of a single place I've ever known of that would be that strict with kids under the age of 12, or 10 at the youngest. They just don't do it, and again because it's so difficult to get kids that young to comply with things like dress codes, that doing so usually creates more issues than it's worth.\n\nSo, no, not really. Formal or not, it's just not a thing that really happens.\n\nThe whole \"under the age of 12, does not apply\" thing actually makes a ton of sense, and as someone who spent 10 years in the business is actually what I expected when I started watching this video.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean that this host was actually applying a racist double standard - I know how busy it gets in restaurants, and it's entirely possible that the first kid was just overlooked. It's also possible that this guy was interpreting his restaurants policy in an overzealous manner that his boss did not intend. I really can't say one way or another, all I know is that applying those sorts of codes to very small children is completely ridiculous.",

Given, I think the minute she pointed out the inconsistency in the policy's application, he should have just apologized, and let them be seated. At that point, there's no argument you could make. He could've said that he hadn't noticed the other child, and given the discrepancy, he'd make an exception. Restaurants really need to ditch those kinds of dress codes anyway.

They only let me back in when my dad who is white showed up just right after I had been threatened to leave. Like your parents tell you to go reserve a table with the hostess and I was trying to do that and the employees started screaming at me they don\u2019t serve my kind, get out or they were going to call police etc. just exploded in rage when they saw me walk in. My parents showed up, wondering what the problem is, I explained what happened. The restaurant could tell that my parents are Americans wanting to spend money. But the manager and employees just stood there glaring at us and making angry faces at me. One of the biggest \u201cwtf did I do to you?\u201d Moments of my life. \n\nI also got thrown out of an IHOP in Florida one time with my parents and the old waitress there literally screamed at my parents and me that she didn\u2019t serve our kind. The younger waitress at that Florida IHOP ran up screaming to the old waitress that they can\u2019t say that, it\u2019s illegal, lawsuits, corporate etc. and then the younger waitress tried to seat us. My parents did the polite version of \u201cfuck this. We are leaving!\u201d And we left. So, 5 years later when my\nexperience in Quebec happened my parents were thinking I should be used to being discriminated against and that place\nSo far had not kicked them out and they were the ones paying. I refused to order anything out of protest and the entire hour we were there the employees started yelling  at me to order something. I was stubborn and kept telling everybody \u201cno! I\u2019m not ordering anything!\u201d Like I\u2019m Meeghan from Key & Peele. \n\nMy mom later on was all \u201clike\u2026 you\u2019re not hungry?\u201d And I was mad and angrily telling her later on that day that hell yes I was hungry but I refuse to order food from a pretentious shithole with racist employees who treated me like shit. Like I\u2019m usually not turning down a free meal but that place and any IHOPs I refuse to eat at. And the weird thing that I\u2019ve noticed is that people get creeped out if you refuse to eat. Like they\u2019re eating their meal and I\u2019m not a fan of that restaurant then what\u2019s it to them that I\u2019m not eating if it\u2019s not stopping them from eating? \n\nBut yeah, the \u201coldest\u201d restaurant in Quebec can kiss my fat mixed race ass. I\u2019ve been to Canada enough times and met enough rude, racist Canadians to realize that there\u2019s not much difference between the USA and Canada. Like their healthcare system is much superior to the crap system in the USA but that\u2019s it.",

I\u2019m talking about a racist grandma, or a white pride type of person.  \n  \nWhat he did was racist, obviously. But racism is something ingrained in all of us by society, and it\u2019s something we all need to work to combat. Making a huge mistake by racially profiling someone without thinking about it doesn\u2019t make you a racist person, it means that you are human and you need to learn from your fuck-up\u2019s. Everyone\u2019s a little bit racist, including you who is reading this, and we all need to actively check ourselves and learn.  \n  \nThis is why I think calling this guy a racist is a distinction we need to make. He did something racist, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he *is* a racist. We don\u2019t know if he made up for his fuck-up afterwards, or at the very least learned from it. Hopefully he did.  \nIf not, then yeah, I would call him a racist.",

From a management perspective, we require business acumen - you need to be able to use discretion and make the wise choice in the absence of a direct order.

But in a freak situation where we will risk losing business if we don\u2019t make a deadline etc., I must be able to (and do) trust my staff in my absence to make a game-time decision to use competitor and be prepared to defend that choice which is lower stakes than lost business. \n\nThat\u2019s why there are such shit owners/managers - people who don\u2019t hire the right people and lack an ability to make a good call in high pressure situations.

Discrimination is.\n\nJust because someone threatens you with firing or losing your job or career is NOT an excuse to commit crimes.  So no, there is NO sympathy for this guy because 'he is scared' or 'didn't have his heart in it but was commanded by someone else'\n\nSocial pressure is NOT AN EXCUSE for racism.

We can seat you today, but just know for next time that we are *supposed to* enforce a dress code. I\u2019m not sure how the other kid slipped through the cracks but we\u2019ll make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. Would you like a free appetizer on the house as an apology for the confusion?\u201d\n\nAnd if my employer has a problem with me bending the rules for the black family but doesn\u2019t care that the same rule was bent for the white family earlier that same day\u2026 I\u2019d find a new employer, because there\u2019s clearly racial discrimination happening.",

He seems like he's a generally nice guy shoved into a situation where every possible outcome is wrong.  he doesn't look or sound like he wants to enforce this but he has to support the staff.\n\nthe best possible solution would be to say something like \"we have a dress code, but apparently it's not being enforced today. Our staff will need to address that. I would love for you to come back and join us another time, but please know for the future that we will be enforcing a no athletic apparel dress code more strictly. I apologize for the mistake, let me show you to your table.\"\n\nbut it's tough to come up with a solution like that in that situation and if the owner said no athletic shorts and he sits the family anyway, that could be enough to get him fired. \n\nit's not a matter of training, it's a matter of not selectively enforcing shitty policies and avoiding placing middle managers into unresolvable conflicts",

For people in poorer families, this is often the smartest wear that can be managed. Also kids are immensely aware of how they look and self conscious. You don't want this to be a negative formative experience for the kid. This was probably meant to be a special occasion.\n\n\"Sorry, ma'am, you're right. It looks like the previous manager isn't enforcing our dress code today. Please come inside, where would you like to sit? Your first drink is on the house, sorry for the inconvenience. Please take a seat, I'll be over to check everything is okay shortly\".\n\nTake over responsibility for the table temporarily. Have someone send their drinks over. \n\nGive the lady 5 minutes to cool down then go over and apologise for the situation and tell them their dessert or whatever you're allowed to offer is on the house. \n\nShe'll probably want to vent a little. Let it happen. Acknowledge the mistake and continue to apologise. Compliment or make a bit of a fuss over the kid, if you can do it without being weird. This was a pretty stressful situation for him. He mum was just (justifiably) very embarrassing, he's probably mortified, self conscious and just had a taste of the deep rooted unfairness of the world because of the colour of his skin, so you try to undo some of that damage.",

He's getting thrown into a shitty situation that he needs to unwind.  He's getting called in as back up to an employee who was already trying to enforce the dress code.  By support the staff I mean he can't just come up and say \"sorry about that, our host is a racist piece of shit, please follow me to your table.\"  If they are following policy he needs to have their back or they will lose all trust in him as a leader.  He can't just throw employees under the bus as soon as there is conflict.\n\nit's very possible this place does have a strict dress code and enforces it regularly and whoever sat that family on the patio without enforcing it correctly is the employee that screwed up. If they're going to bother to have a dress code, they're most likely going to enforce it. \n\nso in that situation, you have one employee who was thinking \"yeah, it's technically not dress code but it's a kid and theyre going to sit outside, so I'll give them a pass.\"  And then another employee enforcing the dress code correctly.  If the same employee sat both families, then that employee has at least some unconscious bias issues and is probably racist.  if the manager made or was aware of both of those decisions, then he is at fault and may be racist or at least biased as well.  But there are a lot of scenarios where that isn't the case.  I have never been in this particular situation, but I have had to mediate conflict between clients and staff all the time.

Aside from being a (dysfunctional) democracy Americas never really been about freedom or liberty or justice or any of that other crap the governments been spewing since its inception. What America is really all about is the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.\n\n\nFun fact, did you ever learn why exactly George Washington was so angry at the British government? Its because they ruined his land scalping enterprise. You see during the French and Indian wars (7 years war to Europeans.) Washington had a high ranking position in the British Army fighting the North American theater of the war off in what was at the time Indian land. While he was there he paid a whole much of accounts to map out the lands west of the Appalachian mountains, so that after the war was over and the land became avalible for settlment he could buy up all the best properties before anyone else could get to them and resell them at a profit to the settlers. \n\nAfter the war tho Parlement decided to forbid people from settling the newly acquired land, which pissed alot of people off, but Washington especially so since he had devoted all that time and money into his land speculation scheme. And that's what caused him to rebel. If Palrement had just let people start settling that land as soon as the war was over Washington would have doubled or tripled his wealth by exploiting the system and then been happy as lark under British rule for the rest of his life. \n\nThe country was literally founded by rich capitalists for rich capitalists.",

But I do get what you're saying that one should want to dress up for it and being among the history and architecture...well, it's just nice to get dressed up for such events. I agree. \n\nBut as a once poor person who loves going to plays and ballets and operas, I can 100% tell you that if there was a dress code when I was growing up, my parents could have never afforded to take my family to shows...it was bad enough that us kids couldn't all go to the same things and they had to pick and choose who got the culture or the sports or the after school activities.

But for hospitality the labour shortage it's mostly because the pandemic has meant there are less students available to work, and those non-students that did work in hospitality have found breathing space to move onto a better career. With more security.\n\nFor farming, there's shortages because it's low paid seasonal work and British people don't want to quit permanent jobs to move across the country and live in a shared caravan/trailer with a bunch of strangers. \n\nIn the high skilled professional sector, it's because there literally aren't enough high skilled people. Nothing to do with living wages there, just supply and demand.\n\nSo yeah I get you see the reason for a labour shortage and know the reason it's affected you... But it's still a labor shortage :)",

If an Arab man wore a kaftan and shemagh, he's within dress code.\n\nYou can make the argument that dress codes are classist, but saying it is racism implies that *only* people who satisfy the white standard (or the western standard since business casual and formal wear is worn by all races in America) for acceptable dress.\n\nEven then, I'd argue that it isn't even classist.

You're like the guy in the video, you're not listening.\n\nI'm saying we don't know what was said before the phone was pulled out.\n\nI think the code is against team/athletic gear.  The white kid was wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  The black kid is wearing athletic/team gear.  \n\nThe problem is communication and this guy was doing a terrible job at it.  He could also be racist as hell and/or just making shit up.\n\nI'm really hard-pressed to believe this restaurant denies black people from dining there so I'm guessing it's just poor communication of a dress code policy.  I presume they're trying to avoid the type of crowd that wears athletic gear out in public which can be any race, to maintain a certain amount of decoram.\n\nYou can agree or disagree with my assessment but unless you're Dr Who you don't know what happened or was said before the cell phone came out.",

Other employees make mistakes. That does not mean that you're obligated to make those same mistakes again just because it was made for somebody else. \n\nFor example, let's say you're working retail and the cashier next to you accidentally sells a $50 item for $15 because she didn't understand a coupon policy. The customer you're serving sees her make this mistake and demands you give that same $50 item to her for $15. Are you then obligated to make that same mistake. Somebody benefited from an employee mistake. That doesn't mean that everyone should benefit from that same employee mistake.",

Within reason sure. If the price is $13 and it was shown at $12.50, sure. But we had way too many people getting $50 items and wanting them for $5. More often than not, the \"mistake\" was one customer taking the $5 sign and bringing it over to the $50 merch or a customer accidentally finding a $50 products mixed in with a $5 products.",

They had other such cases of bad dress code that had to be changed.\n- The white kid was wearing clothes that were almost the same but not the same. His clothes were compliant with the shitty policy.\n- The server had to speak as per the speaking points given to him by the restaurant HR and he was compliant with the restaurant's policy.\n\nAll the comments supporting him on that thread have been downvoted but there are upvoted comments asking how anyone could defend him. \n\nIRL, I am nowhere near Atlanta and have never been to the city.

Also if your a restaurant who won\u2019t allow even kids to dress a certain way, why not be able to have some clothes readily available for kids to wear so they don\u2019t feel embarrassed like this? That way you keep the image up and classy, and you can teach the youth how to dress up/tie a tie. Wish I learned that when I was younger. \n\nI still don\u2019t know and I\u2019m 29.",

So basically, me asking if there MIGHT be any other reason than racism, makes me racist.

Who's literally just some kid who had to choose between kicking someone out of a restaurant and his job... That makes me racist?\n\n\nYeah... I'm the one spitting bullshit lol\n\n\nNo, you're trying to force a narrative, which I'm willing to except happens(like that the managers were racist, and we're doing some shitty racist stuff), but I'm also going to look into EVERYTHING I can before placing a verdict... you know... The smart thing to do(like not taking it out on the young waiter, and instead on the man in charge of his pay check FORCING him to do this). But have fun blindly assigning blame, youll be right now and again, this time you are (not in our argument, but in fighting these racist pieces of shit [the people from the restaurant])\n\nThere's a reason there is so much hate in America, and you're a great example",

They had me drive almost 2 hours to a remote chef's school with an affiliated fine dining restaurant to review it.  Turned out they had a jacket policy and, while they were willing to lend me a jacket, I had to decline both the jacket and to do the review due to my personal convictions about dress codes in this and other contexts.  My editor was pissed and absolutely did not accept my justification but, it is what it is, I'm not gonna even loosely suggest to people that they should patronize an establishment like that and lifestyle magazines aren't in the business of giving bad reviews, so the only option was to leave it.\n\nI can live with \"business casual\" because no restaurant in its right mind actually enforces that but fuck you if you think I need to wear a suit to eat your food, you're out of your god damn mind.",

However, their most prestigious customers disagree, and even if they won't outright state it, they'll just stop going there if they feel it's too 'common' because the restaurant loses its charm. \n\nHigh end restaurants don't really sell food, they sell the experience of upscale dining.

I think dress party situations are pretty neat and can be enjoyable. Some high end restaurants try to give you that feeling. Having someone dressed incorrectly for the event can pull you out of the enjoyment of it. Pretty sure certain types of cosplay events are exactly like that. \n\nAnd this entire statement has nothing to do with this event, because this event clearly shows that they were letting people come in without the 'appropriate' clothing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTheir best solution would have been to have a room full of clothing that people could change into, which would be cool imo.",

In many workplaces I can understand the need to look professional for customers, but the idea that even the people paying for services or goods have to meet a dress standard just to be permitted in the restaurant is ridiculous. \n\nThere's a decent chance this whole thing happened because there was a change in shifts and one person didn't care about dress code standards and the other had a stick-up-their-ass about it. Or that depending on how much of a clusterfuck of activity the restaurant is experiencing at any given moment enforcing the dress code goes either on the backburner or is actually enforced. Just let your customers wear whatever tf they want and then you avoid awkward situations like this. Hell, be grateful you have customers; don't go turning them away unless they're like... naked or something.",

I don't think anyone intentionally singled the black kid out, and I hope that the discussion can move forward that the problem here probably wasn't *overt* racism, but ingrained invisible racism.\n\nYou tell that guy to stop being racist, and you probably haven't solved anything.

Its pretty common knowledge that in one particular night life district, when the customer base gets \"too black\" in a place, it signals the beginning of the end for that establishment. Its an early indicator that the place will go under within a year or two.\n\nI'm not even claiming that the owners themselves are particularly racist, its probably more the customers. But the owners implement dress codes that disproportionately keep black people out of their clubs. It used to be no jerseys, flat bill hats, overly baggy jeans, etc etc. They were very clearly targeting a racial demographic.\n\nThis restaurant is doing the same thing albeit a bit more subtle. \"Athletic\" isn't an indicator of how well dressed a person is. I guarantee if a white lady showed up in her $250 Lululemon outfit, they wouldn't bat an eye at seating her. And if their genuine goal was to keep dress standards above a certain level they wouldn't have a standard as narrow as just athletic clothes, and they also wouldn't have served that white boy that was dressed down like he was. \n\nI don't have an issue with dress codes in general. I respect that certain restaurants want to maintain an image and atmosphere. The issue is when the wording of the dress code disproportionately targets one demographic. \"No burkhas\" clearly has a target.",

Given the appearance of this place, I'd bet the former, and given the size and location in a major metropolitan area, they almost certainly have at least two hosts.\n\nEven if the same host greeted both parties, the one outside looks to be larger, making it easy to imagine a child going unnoticed or the parent and child showing up after the rest of the party has already been seated. Then you have a mother and child party of two walk in and the host bringing up the dress code and que the scene. Some scared shitless confrontation-averse manager comes over, doubles down not noticing the kid outside, then after his attention is brought to it he panics and goes into customer service 101 robotic empathize mode.\n\nHe knows he's on video. And anyone that has been conscious the last 5 years knows the consequences of even appearing racially insensitive on camera, let alone full-blown racist. Being out of a job is a given, but people have been expelled from schools, cast out of social circles. Become effectively radioactive. The social consequences are ENORMOUS. someone would have to be so committed to their seething racist ideologies as to be willing to throw themselves to the proverbial wolves for the sake of inconveniencing this poor black family.\n\nThis new trend of labeling every situation that adversely effects a person of color as being solely motivated by racism without any other consideration or nuance isn't woke, it's just intellectually lazy. Many of these situations are adequately explained by good old social incompetence and bungling of basic conflict resolution.\n\nEdit: and concerning the dress code itself, restaurants like these middle of the pack, wannabe fancy establishments in that same lane as bonefish grill and carrabas love to come up with policies like these that make them feel \"exclusive\". It's more for the customer base that can feel fancy taking grandma out for her birthday dinner to a restaurant with a dress code.\n\nEdit: by all means, down vote instead of actually having a discussion about it. It's so bizarre that any possible explanation for these situations that doesn't begin and end at simple racism cannot even be considered.",

Many of these situations are adequately explained by good old social incompetence and bungling of basic conflict resolution.\n\nOh dear. \n\nFirst, you used \"woke\", which as you know has become nothing more than a perjorative in the mouths of people who want to remain as comfortably racist as they always have been, rather than confront their attitudes.\n\nSecond, this is not a \"new trend\". Racism is centuries old and people still feel the effects of it today. Calling it out isn't particularly new either. \n\nIf accusations of racism are unfair when a black person is being treated differently to a white person for doing the same thing as that white person, as you seem to imply (you're very keen to create a large number of circumstances to absolve the management. You may be correct but goodness you've multiplied many entities - as in, it is still not unheard of for black people in the US to get the raw end of the deal, is it? Quite common, in fact.), at the moment it was pointed out to this guy that a white kid was getting away with something that a black kid was prevented from doing, and the guy was worried about being labelled racist, then he needed to back the fuck down *immediately*. \n\nOr imagine - for the sake of removing the racial element - that the kid in the restaurant had been a white kid. The manager should *still* have backed down - do you agree?\n\nOr imagine that the parents of the white kid were dressed head to toe in in Gucci and Armani, and had arrived in a Maserati, with a kid in a Kappa t-shirt and Adidas shorts? What would the manager's reaction have been then?\n\nNone of this is \"iNteLLEctuAL lAziness\". And if No-no-not-working-there-any-more had been scared of being labelled racist due to being on camera, do you not think he should have refrained from drone-like behaviour and just embloyed a little *fucking* initiative and judgement?",

Remove the dress code, and they'll just use one of the many tried and true racist behaviors. Close/rebrand the entire business? The racist employee and their like will just find employment elsewhere.\n\nWhat they *can* do, is attack the specific problem that was reported, fast, and provide new policy that is clear and non-arbitrary.

My dad was questioned far less frequently as to what he was doing with me. But he was also a redneck built like a brick wall so I guess that shielded him quite a bit.",

As a mildly autistic person that has worked some of those jobs, I can be overly sympathetic to workers in these situations but I\u2019m seeing now that the incidents that I dealt with were the result of A) my social anxiety, which flares up big time in those situations, and B) actual shitty people that they\u2019ve dealt with before me, and beyond that, almost all of my incidents were ameliorated with a sincere apology and a simple, honest explanation of what I was trying to communicate/what happened. It\u2019s like I forgot that the city I grew up in was notorious for using dress codes to keep Black patrons out of upscale places, the confusing amount of racism against Asian men in particular that I\u2019ve seen in bars from both patrons and staff, or the waitresses that I\u2019ve met that have told me about bribing hosts to seat Black families in other sections, or even how hospitals treated my grandmother, a Black-passing indigenous American.

So you say, \"I should get my fair share.\" And as a direct response to this, your dad corrects you, saying, \"Everyone should get their fair share.\" Now, that's a wonderful sentiment \u2014 Indeed, everyone should, and that was kinda your point in the first place: that you should be a part of everyone, and you should get your fair share also. However, dad's smart-ass comment just dismissed you and didn't solve the problem that you still haven't gotten any!\n\n>The problem is that the statement \"I should get my fair share\" had an implicit \"too\" at the end: \"I should get my fair share, too, just like everyone else.\" But your dad's response treated your statement as though you meant \"only I should get my fair share,\" which clearly was not your intention. As a result, his statement that \"everyone should get their fair share,\" while true, only served to ignore the problem you were trying to point out.\n\n>Just like asking dad for your fair share, the phrase \"black lives matter\" also has an implicit \"too\" at the end: It's saying that black lives should also matter. But responding to this by saying \"all lives matter\" is willfully going back to ignoring the problem. It's a way of dismissing the statement by falsely suggesting that it means \"only black lives matter,\" when that is obviously not the case. And so saying \"all lives matter\" as a direct response to \"black lives matter\" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.",

Nobody reacts to that with \"well all types of cancer deserve money/support!\" or \"all cancer awareness matters\"\n\nNot the greatest example, because breast cancer research is notoriously overfunded relative to its mortality rate. See, for example:\n\n[Why do the deadliest cancers get the least attention?](https://www.mdlinx.com/article/why-do-the-deadliest-cancers-get-the-least-attention/5DdSCjkdHA1omjcdxfuy8b)\n\nOne theory is that cancers that could be seen as someone's \"fault\", like liver and lung cancer (which can be caused by drinking and smoking respectively), don't attract as much funding as \"blameless\" cancers like leukemia and breast cancer. On the other hand funding for cervical cancer (often caused by HPV) is doing fine, so it's complex.\n\nCancers that tend to strike older people, like esophageal and pancreatic cancer, are also underfunded. Could you save more lives by diverting those pink ribbon dollars? Very possibly, but they might be AARP members.\n\nI think it's a question of whether a person chooses to see these things as a zero-sum game -- in which case anything given to X takes away from Y -- or whether helping X can also help Y in a \"rising tide that lifts all boats\".",

I agree with you, and I understand the point you were making with your original metaphor.\n\nThe disproportionate funding of cancer research is a troubling subject, because the numbers are so out of sync with what's actually killing people, and have more to do with marketing and our collective sense of whose death does or doesn't count as \"tragic\" than with actual lifesaving. Of course, there are grounds for saying that juvenile cancers deserve a disproportionate amount of funding since the number of years lost is higher when a child or teenager dies.\n\nBut the discrepancy with breast cancer is wildly out of control: in the US, breast cancer research gets almost **fifteen times** more government funding than lung cancer, yet lung cancer kills more than three times as many people, so breast cancer research is arguably overfunded by a factor of 45!\n\nAnd then there's the sketchiness of the Susan G. Komen foundation, which some see as the ultimate triumph of marketing (aka pinkwashing) over actual benefit...",

And it's called being an emotionally intelligent adult. You don't just lash out physically when someone has a different (even if it's a worthless piece of shit) mentality. \n\nIf somebody doesn't understand WHY they were shunned, what have you accomplished?\n\nThe point is not simply *accepting* that those people should have a place in the world, albeit under you or me.... Rather showing them that there's a place for everybody.\n\nSo if you try to reason and understand, and you fail and they're still a garbage person, you actually made an effort.\n\nIf you just ignore those people or smash them in the face, they still exist, just with bruises. And you've accomplished nothing except this: in their fragile worldview, someone that they didn't overtly agree with attacked them, and they'll never trust you or your movement or your ideas.\n\nIt's not about being centrist, or leftist, or conservative.  It's about being a human to another human.",

So while I, with native american blood, totally get the feeling that I'm being left behind while another race is being catered to, it doesn't do me any good to oppose BLM on jealousy, when I'm free to join many of the countless nature American activist groups that work *side by side* with blm.

They want to stop racism against Blacks. This does not mean they are promoting racism against everyone else, nor that they don't believe racism exists outside of their scope. They are only looking for \"privilege\" in the sense that equality is a step up from where they've historically been. To switch analogies, that's like telling a hungry kid \"you just want all the pizza for yourself!\" when he hasn't had any, and all his friends already ate their fill.",

Middle class black Americans who lost work in the pandemic were also more likely to face challenges feeding their families compared to their white compatriots who had also lost work, with 68.1% of such black families facing food shortage compared to 49.3% of white families.\n\nHealthcare outcomes are worse for black Americans pretty much across the board due to their facing medical discrimination, uninsurance at twice the rate of white Americans, and the historical effects of redlining resulting in weaker healthcare infrastructure in the areas where they live. The same historical redlining puts black children in worse schools with fewer resources, before they eventually get old enough to become caught up in a judicial system that targets them and then is rigged against them from the police through the courts. I won't start listing statistics there, because there are so many that this would end up being ten pages long.\n\nBlack Americans are 33% less likely to get a call back from a potential employer if they have a black sounding name on their resume. Black owned small businesses are twice as likely to get rejected for a loan. Their houses appreciate slower and their life expectancies are 3.6 years lower. Racist bias is quietly baked into just about every aspect of our society.",

A lot of those issues are also more difficult to address than others but great steps can be made without race-specific legislation. Police accountability is one I obviously harp on a lot and imo would be the best first step towards healing for this country. Universal Healthcare would help a lot too (but much more difficult to enact). Quality community programs for low-class neighborhoods.

I remember there was a time in high school that I had donated blood at a school drive, drank my can of juice or whatever after, then had lunch where I drank a large fruit drink. Not long into my next class, I desperately had to pee. I was known to be a good kid and student and I\u2019m sure I\u2019d never asked my teacher before because she had a hardline stance of not allowing people to use the hall pass, but I was in physical agony and she refused my request. I sat there in near tears and not doing anything, even listening, because I was in so bad a state and trying not to pee my pants. She finally relented (and I loved this teacher other than this one incident, she was just super strict), but in retrospect this was a thing I should have just ignored what I was told and gone. I think teachers in general are better about letting kids get their physical needs met now (like my kids are allowed to have water bottles at school and it sounds like they can all go to the bathroom when they need to as long as they haven\u2019t been abusing their hall pass privileges), but I\u2019m sure there are still plenty that are hardliners about stuff like this given the other stuff they do (like my daughter getting a bad grade in gym because she didn\u2019t have a phone to do a particular assignment).",

I get the point that you and other folks make, and I support the movement.\n\nBut the point of a movement like this one isn't to change my mind - I'm already on board. It's to change the mind of others. And you don't change the mind of others with branding that (to them) sounds like you're intentionally excluding them. \n\nInstead of arguing with people who say \"all lives matter,\" wouldn't it be better to just agree with them? I mean, honestly, if the goal of the movement is to change their minds, starting off with arguing with them over a statement that - let's admit it - shouldn't be controversial, isn't gonna work. If you want to change someone's mind, you have to start on common ground. You will not change anyone's mind by starting an intentionally inflammatory argument. \n\nOne only needs to look at history for this: who made more measurable progress? MLK or Malcolm X? Both did make an impact, but it's clear who actually made a difference. What was MLK's stance? One example: that restitution money should be used for all disadvantaged people - not just disadvantaged black people. Malcolm X's view: the eradication of the white race is imminent. \n\nMLK also made points such as (paraphrased) \"bringing black people to equality right now isn't going to work - they need to be advantaged for a while because of the systemic issue.\" This is the heart of the BLM movement today - if we want to reach equality, black people will have to have some advantages in the short term so that the macro trend can be changed. And that's a fair point of view. We've (at least superficially) had equality for a while, and it's not really working, is it? \n\nBut look at it from a person's perspective who believes equality is the path to equality (which isn't an entirely unreasonable stance). If you combine the above philosophy that equality can be achieved through temporary inequality with a brand that only includes a single race, how does that look to someone who is ignorant of the ideas? If you can step outside of your own knowledge and opinions and take that context solely at face value, I think you'll start to understand why this movement is having such a hard time getting traction with a lot of folks. Some of them are racist, sure, and it doesn't matter what you say for them - they won't support it. However, the ones who aren't racist and are ignorant of what is actually desired think it sounds more like Malcolm X's stance than MLKs, and looking at it in those terms, I can't blame them for having a hard time being on board.",

The details that one needs to know and understand in order to fully comprehend why a certain left wing policy is needed and will work and be beneficial to society are not always common knowledge.    \n\nStating a policy position in a catchy slogan is a lot harder in this context because of the knowledge gap between fully informed policy and common knowledge.    \n\nThe \u201cdefund the police\u201d thing is a great example. \u201cDefund the police\u201d is a lot catchier than \u201creduce funding to the police to better fund mental health services and also take a large burden off the responsibilities of law enforcement.\u201d     \n\nThis makes it easier for the right wing to mischaracterize our policy positions using their own catchy slogans by drastically misrepresenting our side. Not quite an example of the slogan thing, but a good example of the ease with which the right can demonize good and nuanced policy are needle exchanges and supervised injection sites. These go from a good policy that will keep people safe and healthy and benefit society as a whole to \u201cdemocrats want to enable and even encourage the abuse of hard drugs by giving free paraphernalia to druggies and a safe space to shoot up.\u201d     \n\nBLM is misrepresented as simply anti-white.   \n\nPro-Choice is misrepresented as simply wanting to kill babies.   \n\nAnti-voter-ID-laws is misrepresented as simply wanting unsecured elections.   \n\nAffirmative action is misrepresented as simply anti-white.    \n\nWelfare programs are misrepresented as simply encouraging failure.   \n\nProgressive taxation is misrepresented as simply punishing success.    \n\nUniversal healthcare is misrepresented as simply socialist and/or more expensive.   \n\nDecriminalizing drugs is misrepresented as simply encouraging the use and abuse of hard drugs.    \n\nGun control is misrepresented as simply grabbing guns.^1   \n\nAll of these policies are rooted in facts and have real world examples of how and why they are effective and preferable to the status quo, but they\u2019re easy to mischaracterize and impossible to adequately sum up in a catchy slogan that captures all the nuance and additional knowledge needed to understand them.    \n\nThus, it is vital for our democracy, and all other democracies, to have an educated populace that can understand these issues, their nuances, and the underlying relevant histories. Republicans have sabotaged public education for decades in order to ensure they have sufficient numbers of ignorant people they can easily con into voting against their own best interests.    \n\nThe only long term fix for this problem is to modernize our public education system with a total overhaul from the bottom up. Completely dismantle the current system and replace it with something better. And to make higher education a right for all citizens and thus taxpayer funded (calling taxpayer funded things \u201cfree\u201d is harmful to our goals. Not free healthcare, not free college, not free preschool - **taxpayer funded**) to ensure access to all. It\u2019s not a quick fix and the effects will take a generation or more to see, but it\u2019s necessary if this country has any hope of continuing on as a free democracy.    \n\nEdit: Added gun control example and made \u201cfact\u201d plural in the 14th paragraph.    \n\n^1 I am a very pro gun super lefty democrat. I don\u2019t mean confiscating guns (which almost no democrat actually wants to do despite what the right may scream on Fox and OANN) I mean common sense stuff like universal background checks.",

Nobody else does.\n\nFirst, the entire point of propaganda (which is what slogans are, and that\u2019s not a bad thing) is to convince others and change their minds. That means you need to use vocabulary that makes people more willing to support you. That\u2019s literally politicking 101.\n\nSecond, what do you mean nobody else does? Dog whistling exists *because* racists have to sanitize their language and not be blatant about it. Rephrasing what you want to say to be more polite or nicer to hear is ubiquitous. You can claim that minorities have to be more careful with their language than whites, something that is almost undeniably true, but to feel like you\u2019re the only ones who have to watch what they say misses the entirety of political and persuasive rhetoric.\n\nNow, is it fair to expect a bunch of uncoordinated young people to spontaneously come up with the perfect slogans for what they want and the perfect messaging to convince others? Outside of monkeys and typewriters, God no. That\u2019s what *unions* is for. Unions should be able to codify exactly what is wanted into a clear, directed, and polished platform with appropriate pizazz and marketability. Pure grassroots can provide a lot of energy, but unless it\u2019s truly overwhelming, the unfocused nature of it seriously diminishes any chances at affecting change.",

The problem most people have with BLM is not a contextual understanding, it's that a lot of people are simply anti-Black. They understand what it's about just fine. Explaining it in the context you're providing is not going to be some enlightening moment for viewers of Fox news, being anti the BLM movement is just another way of surfacing their bigotry. \n\n> And so saying \"all lives matter\" as a direct response to \"black lives matter\" is essentially saying that we should just go back to ignoring the problem.\n\nYes, that's exactly the point.",

It's forcing change from everyone speaking up and the constant oppression of the guy sitting right beside you on the way to work which makes literal no sense. \n\nSorry if this is not 100% what you meant but this is what I have learned about the all live matter or BLM too distinction.

That you could laugh off, as long as the incidents weren't too violent or otherwise traumatic. But living in a society that regularly treats you differently creates profound trauma and issues in those affected. And unfortunately it becomes normalized and even internalized. Even subtle, non overt racism has an unconscious effect on you over time. Videos like this are just the tip of the iceberg. Living in a racist society has incredibly damaging effects on a person and can unfortunately lead to serious mental health issues.",

My family bought half a duplex in a very middle class white suburban neighborhood in the late 80's, then the 90's boom hit and all the white families wanted to move to bigger homes on full lots, but many of them decided to keep the duplex as rental property- which they poorly managed. So as the white people are leaving, property values are going down, which leads to more departures as people see what direction the neighborhood is going in and more rentals or quick sales to unscrupulous buyers leading to a downward spiral. Racism might have motivated some of it, but it always struck me as primarily an economic shock problem in a neighborhood with poor zoning and inadequate code enforcement. It was only when home prices finished cratering a decade later that most of the homes ended up owned by their residents again and the neighborhood started to slowly recover socially as people began to take care of their own land.",

Their business would eventually shut down because the free market deals with bigotry very well. Especially in the current society where you can\u2019t even be funny without getting cancelled. \n\nRegardless of the fact it\u2019s a violation of human rights, you seriously trust the government that just spent the past two years beating, arresting, gassing and killing its populace for both protests and riots alike, to draw the lines on freedom of speech limitations and what you can and cannot believe? This is the same government that used experimental drugs on sex workers and homeless in the 80s and the same government that introduced crack to the black populations in cities and the same government that tested the effects of syphilis on minorities because they wanted to despite knowing the effects of syphilis. If you want to say that was then and now is now, look at the protests and riots last summer, or what happened to Epstein. \n\nEven in an ideal world I\u2019d be against freedom of speech being violated because it\u2019s a human right, but regardless of where you stand, you can\u2019t genuinely say that you trust the current government to draw arbitrary lines in the sand on speech, one of the most fundamental human rights we have.

Insulting you for being black and actively restricting you things for being black are two completely different things. Freedom of speech and expression are completely apart from this case. If I punch you in the face and I\u2019m arrested, it\u2019s not going against freedom of expression, because I was going against his rights.

People who understand *slavery* 1) don't claim little shit like wearing masks as being *enslaved,* and 2) don't wish it upon others because though no one understands slavery alive today \u2014\u00a0there are people alive who hear first-hand accounts that are alive today, and live with the impacts and don't want that for anyone. It's why almost every social program that originated from black and anti-racist movements include everyone (e.g. the concept of voting rights, public school system, birth right citizenship, and universal healthcare, etc). All of these concepts map back to the Civil Rights movement of the 1800s and the Civil Rights act of 1866.\n\nDisenfranchised people asking for the aggregate society to \"take your boot of our necks\" isn't also asking for the boot to be put in theirs. This false dichotomy still works politically because some peoples sense of self is better described by exclusion and what they aren't versus what that are.

Shitty as in low cost apartments vs McMansions. One morning during a meeting the racist manager bitch was telling us how we need to be watchful for theft and that it\u2019s likely coming from people in *that* area (gestures towards the shit apartments). I raised my hand and asked, \u201cwhat\u2019s that supposed to mean. You do know that I love over there as do two other employees, are you accusing us of theft?\u201d\n\nShe backtracked and said \u201cyou know what I mean\u201d. Yeah bitch, we all know I\u2019m just trying to get you to say it out loud. \n\nA few weeks later she gets on the radio to warn everybody of a group of people coming in we should keep an eye on\u2026 I look across my section towards the front doors to see nothing but a family that looks like they just got out of church. But tall black dude in a dapper suit, tall black wife in a beautiful red dress, black daughter in a cute dress and a tiny black son also in a tiny suit. I get on the radio (that every employee in the store hears) and replied, I don\u2019t think we need to keep an eye on them just because they\u2019re black, the fucking hardy boys (white rich kids) are the ones actually stealing shit, I\u2019ve watched them do it. But you only pester black people so they always get away with it\u201d\n\nShe came storming towards my section to grab me and take me to the back stick to yell at me for disrespecting her on the radio. I straight up told her I didn\u2019t care and that she was being a fucking racist. From there on out I never played by her or any of managements rules. I did my own thing until I got the fuck outta there. \n\nWho can tolerate that level of fuckery? I just don\u2019t understand",

Liberals look at it as simply applying critical theory to race.\n\nReally this is all stuff that should be integrated into every subject -- critical thinking; the questioning of assumptions -- instead of taught as some sort of separate topic. I mean, that's really what you're teaching with CRT anyway, that there are certain societal presumptions that force us to think certain ways about history, policing, economics, etc. Teaching it as its own separate thing is less effective and catches more heat from conservatives, making the teachers job even harder.",

Or, maybe you can assign everyone six numbers, and then draw six numbers randomly from a barrel. There\u2019s lots of options. These are the starting conditions determined by the system, and the lottery outcomes follow from them.\n\nIf you use the first system, then there will be a single random winner chosen every time. If you choose the latter, then you can have several winners, or none. *While the specific winner is random, the type of outcome you get is pre-determined based on the starting conditions.*\n\nIn the case of racist acts, a society\u2019s laws and customs determine the starting conditions. For this specific case: \n\nLaws - what happens legally when someone is caught being racist to a restaurant patron (generally nothing, maybe a lawsuit if there\u2019s strong evidence and no plausible deniability), who do laws protect in practice (generally the person with the most money). \n\nCustoms - is casual racism the norm in a significant number of locations or subgroups (yes), are there social consequences for behaving like this (only if there\u2019s damning public evidence), are there social incentives to exclude specific racial groups (yes, because a lot of people hold racial prejudices).\n\nThe system that is in place, right now, *guarantees* that some number of people will be the victim of racial discrimination because it is set up that way. Who gets targeted is random, but the fact of it happening is systematically ensured.",

Personally I like dress codes because I\u2019m going to these places to feel fancy (it\u2019s the atmosphere). I\u2019m get really annoyed by what teenagers/kids wear now because of videos like this. When I see a white teen in a sweatshirt I know that a black kid would be barred. That\u2019s what bothers me the most about it. Either enforce it for all or don\u2019t enforce it for kids/teens.

For instance a nearby Steak House didnt allow sports shoes or shorts. The Waiter explained nicely. I asked if I ate at the outside seating would it be possible. He inquired by the Manager and the rule was waived. Ive negotiated several times at multiple establishments to the same effect.\n\nThis might not be racial. I mean if its the same server then definitely. However its possible a different waiter ignored the rule because its a kid and the family dined outside not inside. The waiter on question might not have known about it and when confronted lacked the EQ to correctly handle the situation instead clinging to the rules.",

Also, one individual *cannot* prove or disprove an average.\n\nI understand what you said, it just doesn't make sense, which made me entertain the possibility that I had misunderstood you.

Managers are hired specifically to exercise good judgement or discretion when making decisions. \n\nJust because he didn\u2019t have a class to tell him exactly what is and isn\u2019t acceptable dress code is no excuse - it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that the white kid already seated is dressed to the same standard as the black kid. You really don\u2019t need a class to tell you that he shouldn\u2019t have used that as an excuse to not let the black kid eat there. If that was the hill he wanted to die on and he truly didn\u2019t notice the white kid out of dress code before, he should\u2019ve asked that family to leave as well. \n\nAre you really blaming the restaurant owners for the fact that this manager was stupid enough to stop a black family from eating there because their kid was out of dress code while he had a white family already seated with their kid wearing the same shit?",

Because of that they don't think this was enough. \n\nHowever looking at this I see it is they are admitting there is an issue and they are doing their best to fix it. They removed the individual who seriously fucked up, from my experience indefinite leave for a lot of businesses means they are making sure that when they fire him their asses are covered, they are making sure everything is organized and ready. They are doing what they can to fix the issue, change in the rules, training for employees etc. They admit it is fucked up and what is refreshing is they don't put all the blame on him(the manager) they admit it was a failure on their part, that it was a systematic problem. \n\nA lot of these people who are upset are calling for some kind of punishment, towards the individual or company. The issue I have with that is no matter how good your company training or oversight or whatever is there will always be some individuals who are fucked up will make it through and cause problems. The company shouldn't be punished if they respond to such incidents once made aware of them, which they did. As for punishment of the individual I can understand that and can get behind that to a degree. There would need to be an investigation, and due process to gather all of the information and handle it appropriately and with proportionality. Essentially the dude gets his day in court.",

It\u2019s not like Marquee has a big window outside displaying how many women are in the club. It\u2019s about reputation once you\u2019re in the door. So less advertising and more avoiding the situation I described where guys come in and then leave and don\u2019t buy drinks or come back.  Their goal is to have a packed house doing exactly what you describe - buying drinks and socializing and dancing. If male customers won\u2019t spend money if there aren\u2019t females there, then that isn\u2019t an issue with the club, it\u2019s an issue with the consumer\n\n> which isn't why women are going there typically\n\nI mean, are you sure about that haha? Not everyone is trying to hook up, but you don\u2019t go to Vegas clubs to just talk to the girls/guys you came with.\n\nI\u2019d also say the girls I know don\u2019t want to be in a club that\u2019s 80% guys either. They feel more comfortable if there are a lot of other women around.\n\n> So people are using women to sell their bar/club. I'm just not comfortable with that type of scheme.\n\nHonestly, I think this attitude does more to reduce the agency of women in the situation. Women choose to go to that club, they aren\u2019t being \u201cused.\u201d Men also choose to still go, still pay covers, still pay for tables and bottles (which you often need to do in order to get in with a big group of guys). \n\nClubs aren\u2019t manipulating us all - everyone there is a willing participant. \n\nThe options clearly aren\u2019t \u201cdiscriminate or just let everyone in\u201d - it\u2019s \u201cdiscriminate or people won\u2019t come to your club and you\u2019ll go out of business.\u201d  If they could charge groups equally they would, economically, because otherwise they\u2019re burning cash letting girls in cheaper. These are massive businesses, they know what they\u2019re doing haha",

Clearly all the people that still do are at least implicitly ok with the system enough to spend their money on it. \n\nI think the connection that you\u2019re not making is that the \u201cinclusive\u201d version isn\u2019t actually the product those people want to buy. Again - if a club on the strip said screw it, no cover for anyone, it\u2019s pretty easy to find evidence online that it would:\n\n1. Attract a bunch of guys relative to girls\u2026 and \n\n2. Then see both the guys and girls leave and spend less (and then it would go out of business, unless it has other differentiators)\n\n> imagine going well we aren't going to be more inclusive with movies or kids toys because white people have more money to spend so we will appeal to them only?\n\nThat\u2019s not a fair parallel because the consumer\u2019s choice to buy the product doesn\u2019t change the product itself. There\u2019s no downside to added a black Barbie unless you\u2019re a racist haha, but there is a downside to all consumers of a nightclub if you let the gender split go too heavy in one direction\n\nThe product of a Vegas nightclub isn\u2019t the club itself. It\u2019s the crowd. So they only have something to sell that people want if they have the right crowd, and achieving a gender split is one key factor. If both guys and girls prefer a female biased crowd (which there\u2019s evidence for outside personal experience, just google a bit), then you\u2019re making the product worse to everyone by being \u201cinclusive\u201d\n\n> The question I think is, do we want to accept this sort of practice and be hypocrites or change the systems in place so this sort of thing isn't as prevalent.\n\nSee above as to what would happen. The consumer decides - and to be frank, there are plenty of other options for booze, music, and entertainment, so it\u2019s not like men have to pay covers compared to women to do anything similar (or to go to clubs in smaller cities where there aren\u2019t enough people for the gender split to matter). \n\nIf I want to go to a buzzy club, where there\u2019s typically more demand for entry than capacity, and I want to go somewhere to meet girls, then the system isn\u2019t discriminating against me - it\u2019s actually helping to give me what I want.",

I\u2019m saying the commodity is the crowd of people.\n\nSo the person going to the club isn\u2019t \u201cbuying a woman\u201d just as the club isn\u2019t \u201cselling\u201d a woman. Both the women and the men are the consumers in this scenario.\n\nThe \u201ccommodity\u201d is the \u201cclub experience\u201d - which is inclusive of:\n\n1. The aesthetic and physical atmosphere of the club (why places pay for fancy lights and decor)\n\n2. Music (why places pay for big DJs over little ones)\n\n3. Booze \n\n4. Dancing and socializing, which for many people is with the opposite sex\n\nBoth men and women are going to clubs for a mix of all 4. So if the gender ratio in your club is out of whack, that hurts the fourth part. \n\nAgain, you\u2019re assuming the women have no agency here. That they don\u2019t want to go to clubs like this and are only a \u201ctool\u201d of the club. That\u2019s pretty obviously not the case - we\u2019re not talking about a strip club where the women are the actual product being sold \n\nThe nightclub you\u2019re describing doesn\u2019t exist because these consumers, of both genders, aren\u2019t looking for that. \n\n> If I go to a bar now it is because I want to try some different beers, socialize with friends, or read a book (with a beer lol).\n\nThat sounds lovely, it\u2019s just also clearly not what the people going to clubs in Vegas are looking for haha.",

It probably would lead to resentment, or miscommunication of wants. Like for example guy goes to club, sees lots of women there cause there is some sort of benefit, goes to enter and is made to pay 20 bucks for some cover to get in (which is there to weed people out, they want to know you got money to spend). At this point does this guy have an expectation that the women are there for them? Like the women being there is the draw right? \n\nIt is entirely different from inviting an influencer or some band to draw people. People are going for that specific thing and are likely paying for it in some way. To me there is a danger to having women be showcased without their consent. Like wouldn't you want to say yes or no to a company utilizing your body for their personal gain? If both sides are in sound mind and agree to it, then sure go for it. However, I don't think many women would sign on to that.",

Women get in for free or less, and get the benefit of having more women around them which can make for a more comfortable atmosphere. And men also get to go to a club where there is a better ratio - I\u2019m not sure where you keep missing that guys don\u2019t want to go to a nightclub to be surrounded by all guys, and neither do girls \n\n> To me there is a danger to having women be showcased without their consent.

They choose to go to the club lol - that\u2019s called consent \n\nI\u2019m not defending anything beyond that, but it seems like you refuse to acknowledge that all these women are choosing to go there. They aren\u2019t being kidnapped haha and can go anywhere else if they want to\n\n> If both sides are in sound mind and agree to it\n\nYes exactly! That\u2019s literally what is happening. The club says \u201c$20 for girls and $50 for guys\u201d and guess what? The girls and guys CHOOSE to go there and CHOOSE to pay that haha\n\nDo you think these clubs are abducting women off the street and parading them around in ads for the club?

This isn't a white knight attempt, but rather a stance that a business shouldn't be allowed to make money off a person without that person knowing what they are being used for\n\nWhere is the objectification? What do you not understand about the fact that women also prefer clubs with equal or pro-female ratios? The club isn\u2019t \u201cdoing anything\u201d with the women - they\u2019re literally just letting them into their establishment (AND THE WOMEN WANT TO BE THERE OR THEY WOULDN\u2019T BE THERE) \n\nThat\u2019s not objectification because the women have the agency. \n\n> I mean the argument you make could be said for privacy. If facebook wants to sell your data they should be allowed to, because you signed up for it acknowledging the contact. Why should anyone be upset for that? Yet they are.\n\nThis is another straw man. \n\n1. If you sign a contract that says you allow Facebook to sell your data, then yes you are providing consent and no, you have literally no ground to stand on in being upset. Don\u2019t use facebook then.\n\n2. Just because people are upset doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re justified. And again - selling data is selling a byproduct of the main transaction. The only transaction in entering a club is what I said earlier. These women aren\u2019t being forced to hand out fliers or stand in the front window to attract men. They just get to do whatever in the club they came to do. That\u2019s not some sort of manipulation \n\n> \"are you ok with a club using you to attract men to the establishment\" \n\nCan you explain the mechanism by which this happens? They aren\u2019t being used. They want to go to the club to talk to guys, and then they do. What is so hard to understand about this?\n\nAnd for the final time, you keep acting like these women are cluelessly walking into some situation where they\u2019re being taken advantage of. I have talked to my girlfriends that go clubbing, since we often go together, and like I already told you - they know exactly what is happening\n\nHow is it this hard to wrap your head around the idea that people just like going to the club, and the cover system gives everyone benefits? If it didn\u2019t (hint, hint) PEOPLE WOULD STOP GOING TO CLUBS",

In today's fast fashion and cheap enough clothing that they literally throw away because of excess, dressing down is a choice not a cause of poverty. As a private business I can choose to create a certain ambience which my customers are paying a premium for, it is not an income issue when you can get a whole suit for $10 at good will if thats how low income you are.

The video made\npublic earlier today was by a very concerned mother after she and her young son\nwere denied seated dining service at the restaurant due to her son not meeting the\ndress code requirements. The video clearly shows the woman's son, an African\nAmerican young person, wearing athletic shorts and an Air Jordan shirt. The video\nalso shows a Caucasian youth, dressed similarly, who was permitted to dine in the\nrestaurant. This should never have happened, the manager seen in the video has\nbeen placed on indefinite leave. We are sickened by this incident. We sincerely\napologize to Marcia Grant, her son and everyone impacted by this painful incident.\nThis difficult situation does not represent who or what Atlas Restaurant Group\nstands for. While dress codes across Atlas properties are the result of ongoing input\nfrom customers, in no way are they intended to be discriminatory. That said, this\npast weekend's incident at Ouzo Bay clearly serves as a moment we will learn from\nand create change. We've taken the time to gather the facts and repeatedly review\nthe video and interview employees. As a result, we immediately revised our dress\ncode policy so that children 12 years old and younger, who are accompanied by an\nadult, will not be subject to a dress code at any Atlas property. From a management\nperspective, there is a level of sensitivity, discretion, and customer service we\nexpect, and this incident will serve a teachable moment to ensure it is not repeated.\nWe have addressed the issue with all managers and key staff at all properties and\nhave spoken to many stakeholders who have contacted us. All Atlas employees will\ncontinue to receive diversity and inclusion training during this very important time.\nWe know we failed in this instance and sincerely hope to be afforded the\nopportunity to meet with the Marcia Grant and her son, who both deserved better.",

I think the company has a dress code policy that like many dress code policies discriminates against poc whether intentionally or unintentionally. There are two possibilities:\n\n1. This young kid is actually a racist who has taken it upon himself to go out of his way as a front line restaurant manager to discriminate against black people and not allow them in the restaurant.\n\n2. The company has an archaic policy made by white boomers that inherently discriminates against black people by branding certain logos and brands as \"athletic attire\" while allowing \"regular t shirts and tennis shoes\".\n\nGiven that other employees got the manager involved and that the company sees no problem with treating 13 year olds this way I'm going to blame the billion dollar company and not the guy making $13 an hour.",

The restaurant failed as they could have had a more flexible dress code policy in place proactively (they revised after the incident)  If they were really taking responsibility they would own up to the situation they put their employee in. \n\nThough I disagree that you should be able to wear whatever you want to a restaurant that wants to have higher standards.

They've changed their dress code policy for kids under 12, they've put the manager on indefinite leave, and they've implemented sensitivity training for all managers in their org. I can certainly understand a desire to remove the dress code altogether, but short of doing that, I can't imagine what else they can do right now. If in 6 months that manager is still working with them, their dress code policy has gone back to what it was a week ago, and similar issues are occurring, then yes, things have certainly gone wrong and more work is needed. It's impossible for a company to hire someone and be 100% sure that they won't do stupid shit like this. Firing this guy and implementing training is likely their best course of action right now.\n\nAlso, I want to point out that while we don't know if this guy watches Fox News, this is the kind of racism that gets overlooked regularly by people all across the political spectrum. Upholding systems selectively to protect or empower people that look like you is a blind spot that most humans have, and given our current systems that favor cis-het white men, stuff like this is more likely to happen than any alternative.",

We appreciate people trying to be allies, but as any minority can attest, racists have ALWAYS been bold. Micro-agressions are bold, racist policies are bold, racist business practices are bold. It's so fucking exhausting and annoying to have so many people JUST now dicovering how rampant racism has been in this country since it's inception and make these fucking stupid sweeping statements without actually taking the time to do the research. This idea that \"racism ended\" with the Civil Rights movement is exactly why our country is so fucked up now. Maybe this company's apogy isn't 100% genuine, but they ate their fucking Crow and actually changed their policy. Dress codes aren't the problem, it's the way they are used to discriminate against others is the problem. My biggest issue with \"wokeness\" right now is there is no simple common goal like \"end racism, sexism, homophobia, or end transphobia\" Instead, it's about revenge and burning shit down with no real goal in sight. That restaurant was wrong for executing a racist policy, they gave a well-thought apology unlike any of the lazy talking point-driven responses we've heard in the aftermath of indiscretions like these in the past. I am as progressive as they come, but the outrage behind situations like this, and the outrage to the response, and the outrage to the outrage at the response to situations like this just feel like pissing in the wind while racism continues to grow. So how does shutting down this restaurant end racism?",

If you're rich, people will treat you like nobility no matter where you came from or who your parents were - which is really not how \"social class\" works in the UK for example.

Your reaction is part of the pain that people like me feel for our entire lives. Not only do we suffer various levels of overt vs covert racism, we're basically never believed by some folks. It's a double whammy. Double rejection. Bad society tells us quietly to fuck off and good society tells us we're wrong to think it was racism. You're choosing to give one side the benefit of doubt here whether you realize it or not. Why don't I ever get that benefit of doubt? I have 30+ years of experience figuring out what is racism and what is not. I have a white mother, and I understand mistakes can happen ... who do you think has the experience to make this call?

Getting fired does not ruin your life. It's a teachable moment for him, and if he truly had no malice in his heart, he'll do the work to be better going forward. \n\nWhat I hope to get you to see and deal with is the fact that you (likely unconsciously) empathized with the perp and not the victims here. It's likely because you have shared experiences with the manager, and so your instinct is that he is your in-group. That phenomenon happens _all of the time_ and to the detriment of minorities. The open racism hurts, don't get me wrong, but the cover that my white friends constantly gave to racists in situations like this one hurt the most. I knew the open racists were dumbasses that I didn't want to associate with, I didn't know that my white friends saw THEM as in-group, not me. And it's not on purpose! I totally get that, and it's lead to a lot of tough conversations growing up. But whether on purpose or not ... whether company policy or not ... the impact on me is the same, and I just wish that more people could empathize with whoever is RIGHT not whomever you identify with for _whatever_ reason.",

Think about it from his position:\n\nYou seat them. Friends of the owners, the owners, Kens/Karens, or the like, come in minutes later and notices the multiple dress code violations. It's then reported, and you're guaranteed to have upper management come down on the active floor / FoH manager for failing to uphold business policy. That's hot water you do not want to be in. \n\nMy key take aways:\n\n- This is a failure of the **host** to not uphold proper dress code enforcement. He should have also turned away the white family outside. I can't say his actions were racist though, since he could have just overlooked the kid. Kids are pretty small, not to mention they were identical twins... One with a button up, one without.\n- The manager was ultimately up shits creek without a paddle. Do you sit the patrons violating the dress code and potentially put your job on the line? Or do you follow policy and get labeled a racist for just doing your job as you're told? It's a catch-22.\n- I guarantee the decision to put him on leave was made by HR as a cover-our-asses move. It's a common business practice that's done to distance a company from bad PR. They never laid him off for being a racist.\n\nI think this is just a really sad scenario that could have been avoided with more training, better business policies, and allowing room to interpret and enact policy as the situation calls for. Predictably, it took a major incident to get corporate to do just that.",

If that manager had chosen to ignore the dress code and seated that mother and child, unless it somehow went viral that \"black kid in a Jordan tee eats at restaurant, \" the owners wouldve never found out, they would've been none the wiser, and if they had but it brought them no ill-repute on a large scale, they would've shrugged it off like \"well, [manager] has done good work so far, so we trust his judgement\"",

For example, a place back in my hometown would allow adults and families in street wear to dine, but when it was teens who came in the same clothes, it was \"against policy\" and denied service. I was also denied the ability to apply at a Vietnamese restaurant even with culinary experience as \"We only hire Vietnamese people,\" but I learned years later a  redneck girl in my high school psych course had a job there as a waitress that same year I tried to apply. Places decide who and when to apply many policies with a lot more often than you realize, probably because it's never happened with you.\n\n\nThe restaurant here clearly didn't enforce their dress code with the kid, but they do with the black person dressed the exact same way? That's",

His only job is to enforce the rules at that point, not to get involved in racial issues. Maybe he went and chewed out the server who seated the white couple after this for breaking the rules and making him look bad, who knows, we have no more info than this one video.\n\nFunny how reddit goes on and on about Karen's shitting on service industry workers, but on this video everyone's saying that this woman should have had the rules broken for her otherwise this man is a racist.",

This isn't racism in my \"professional\" opinion. I will give you a literal play by play of what went on just based on what I have seen countless times.  Hostess at the front has someone come in and they are violating dress code.  Hostess informs the patron sorry you can't eat here with that dress code.  Woman asks to speak to a manager becuase upset.  (rightfully so if she didn't know the rules, who wants to be turned away for clothes) Hostess leaves to go the manager and give him a brief description of what is happening and that the guest wants to speak to a manger.  Where has the manager been this whole time? Has he been on the expo line making sure food gets out.  Has he been table touching?  Has he been in the office doing paper work? Has he been washing dishes because the dishwasher called out? Did he work salads because the woman who normally works there called out because her kid is sick? Who knows.  Manager comes out and sees the child not in dresscode.  Sorry we can't allow him to eat here. Woman looks and sees the white kid in clothes well how about that kid he seems to be wearing similiar gear to my kid and is white. We have no idea if the manager allowed that kid to eat in the restaurant.  My guess it was probably a hostess. May not have even been the same hostess as most restaurants have multiple. So what's the real issue?  In my opinon the manager is inexperienced and probably had no idea about that kid.  Saw him and just tried to enforce the rules.  No racism just \"we have standards and sucks we missed him but you going to have to leave because not in dresscode\"  Honestly this is where that manager screwed up.  He should of just shown teh woman to a table and apologized and let her know that next time her son's attire isn't appropiate and that he would let the other family know. Instead, due to his inexperience, he just flubbed his words and made himself to look like an ass.  This in no way is racism.  It was inexperience, inability to be flexible, and poor judgement.  The rules for the dresscode were not a hill to die on.  Just becuase one person is white and one person is black doesn't always mean racism. Things happen for multiple reasons not just skin color.  We live in such a society right now where we want to see any slight against any POC as racism when there normally multiple reasons for it and most people are not racist.",

He is more at risk to abuse that power in order to assert himself, differentiate himself, and belong.

I think you ask any manager, especially at fine dining establishments, and they\u2019ll tell you a whole laundry list of bullshit rules they don\u2019t actually believe in/don\u2019t care about, that are passed down from ownership or other managers, that they have to follow. You get desensitized really quickly by allowing or denying certain things because the whole job is kind of being the bad cop to EVERYONE, and sometimes, you lose that \u201cGrey\u201d area where things are \u201cagainst the rules\u201d, but they\u2019re actually not a big deal. Not defending this guy, because he\u2019s an idiot, but he\u2019s clearly just an under trained, under qualified idiot being paid too much money, who has spent the past year arguing with guests about putting their masks on.

For example we have cards for the dressing room to let us know how many clothes the customer went into the room with in case we forgot. Well the number only goes up to 6 and my new coworker whose already a manager in training decided to be a pain in the ass about it and argue with me and the customer about letting them in with more than 6 clothes. 1. It's just a stupid inconvenience and it rarely happens so just let them bring in what they want to try out. 2. The coworker wasn't even watching the changing rooms, you use these cards to help prevent theft, well the person would put the card up and then just leave the area. So I asked them if a room with a card and the occupied sign was even occupied and they couldn't fucking answer me because they weren't even in the area. Why are you arguing with a customer by enforcing half of a policy which makes it entirely redundant. \n\nHonestly really fucking wanted to yell at them but I have self-control. They continue to do this half-ass thing of enforcing policies just enough to inconvenience and be a pain in the ass for customers and coworkers alike, but not actually doing it in a way that has any real merit. I'd try to correct them but they do all this with the self-confidence of someone who would unflinchingly eat shit and claim it's a brownie.

He doesn\u2019t have enough sense to stand up to that, and also is a weakling who refuses to acknowledge to that woman she was right, and then go back to his manager to say this isn\u2019t the time to enforce that dress code as they had already *not enforced it* and it would be a bigger issue. Dude seems clearly both wrong and feeling like he has to stick to his guns as he felt his job was on the line.\n\nSo he should face repercussions but the restaurant shouldn\u2019t get by with pretending it\u2019s only his fault.

First he looks lost and annoyed, like he literally makes the face I do when I have to deal with something I don't want to. \n\nLike he's basically the waiter placing people to their table and he looks quite young. I do t think he's in any managing position or anything. Id be quite surprised he'd has any authority to choose who can come or not.\n\nNot saying that he didn't single out that family on his own but I wouldn't be surprised if he's just stuck in a bad situation because he's trying to do what he's been told to.\n\nBut hey, could be he's a total jackass, I don't know him.\n\nEdit : just read the reply from the company.\nSo unless the waiter was indeed the restaurant manager. The manager and person enforcing that dress code was indeed at fault for allowing the white family (not enforcing the dress code) and not the black family (enforcing the dress code). So it seems like that guy was really trying his best to just.. do what he's been told, as contradictory/unfair as it was. (Assuming he isn't the manager on leave)\n\nWell at least the dress code has been changed for kids and all that bad publicity was probably enough for their staff to be more mindful and, at the very least, consistent in their enforcement of the dress code.",

I was merely implying how blanket rules from a corporate overlord can make it more difficult to do your job. But with any rule, the manager has a huge amount of discretion. And when it gets to the point that the manager has to come in because the customer doesn\u2019t like the way they\u2019ve been treated by another employee, their job is to start with deescalation. They may not give in, but it is imperative that they first deescalate the situation. When this woman pointed out the racial inequity, he should have immediately apologized, said that they should not have been seated either, but of course he would seat them because equity, including racial, is more important than a policy. That would turn things around for the guest, make the restaurant look good and serve as a teachable moment for the staff about the dress code enforcement. This was clearly bad management.\n\nAnd to your point specifically, discretion was absolutely needed because the situation already existed where the other customers had been served. Sure, they should have been turned away first and then it would be fair. But that\u2019s not always going to happen. The issue is that the manager didn\u2019t handle things correctly with their discretion. You can\u2019t stop mistakes as a manager, all you can do is try to course correct to make things right for the customer and educate your staff on how to address the situation going forward.",

So they should be able to seat them too, and seating them could make him go to the boss office. You dont know, I don't know. \n\nI agree with him doubling down on the rule is clearly giving away that there's something wrong but I don't agree with your conclusion. Imo he doesn't act as someone who chose to enforce the rule. Because he never explains it. He never says why there's that rule, he just mindlessly repeat the rule hoping that she'd say \"ok fine we'll take our leave then\".\n\nI believe that guy is stuck. Because if he were the manager (so he could decide whether or not he could make an exception), at some point you see that she's filming you, that you're not going to make it out of this one because she's fucking right and she's a smart cookie. She got you. Too bad, you gotta let that one pass this time, you're gonna have black people at your restaurant. \nBut he's desperately trying and panicking. Like, he seems out of option, and to me that screams he has no option. So he's not a manager, he didn't decide. \n\nI worked at a restaurant that summer and it's very busy. It's in France so it's normal to make a reservation here. So before every shift I would ask how mean seat left we'd have. I would often be told \"we're full deny every one without reservation\" and so I would do. Sometime depending on the timing and stare I would still ask, because maybe we could sit them. But I was told \"deny anyone without reservation\". So I would.\n\nObviously here the situation isn't as simple and clearly there was something fishy. Oddly enough the manager was put on leave so.... Yes there was poor treatment. But unless he was the manager, I do believe that poor kid was stuck in a shit situation. And if he were the manager... Well then he's one dumb of a manager ....",

Give me one solid piece of evidence that this specific situation in this video is racially charged. I see two boys, one who looks like he's about to go play basketball, and one who looks dressed to go eat at the brunch place.\n\nI was told I was nitpicking but everyone here is calling out the boy on the patio wearing a t shirt. A cotton t shirt is athletic attire? Fuck me sideways I guess im ready to workout 99% of the time im awake. Get the fuck over yourselves.

But either way theyre both wearing black shirts, one a t shirt, one a black button up. The matching blue shorts are not athletic shorts. \n\nYou're right somebody who actively experiences racism has more say and more credibility in calling it out but there's also a level of conditioning there. If you're exposed to and see something enough you'll start connecting dots that aren't there in normal everyday interactions.\n\nThe lawsuit was thrown out by the court and the issue was ruled as not a racially biased incident.

So he's come to enforce said rule but then kinda been stuck in a spot of backing up his staff or undermining what they said and looks like he chose the worse option.\n\nI know they've changed the rule but really whose enforcing dress codes on kids. Just tell them you do have a dress code but you'll let it slide this time because really it's a ridiculous rule for kids.\n\nEdit: I will back my staff most of the time unless the customer has a good point or it's something silly like this.",

I ended up having three Swedish roommates after my American one left unexpectedly, one boy and two girls.\n\nThe girls both had Swedish boyfriends living close by but the beautiful one named Kristin and I still made love anyway. Often, she would go out with her boyfriend and they would drink and dance and I could hear her tell him he couldn't come in and that she would see him the next day. Then she would come to my room and shut the door behind her and turn and give that wry smile.\n\nThe sound of the door lock clicking even today excites something deep inside me and takes me back to when life was much different. Back when I didn't have mortgages and loans and kids. Back when the only thing in the world I ever wanted to hear was that door lock and the only thing i ever wanted to feel was her on top of my chest, brushing her hair back and whispering Du Hock Fina Ergon (You have beautiful eyes) in a voice so sultry even today it makes my neck feel wet where her lips were so many years ago.\n\nI've wondered about the spelling and pronunciation of that Swedish phrase but I've never actually Googled it. I don't want to sterilize the memory. For me it will always be in my memory as her on top of me with her arms propped up on my chest and her brushing her short blonde hair behind her ears with just a little bit of sweat running down her chiseled jawline saying Du Hock Fina Ergon.\n\nI didn't say anything at first, I just let those beautiful words spoken by a beautiful woman on a beautiful muggy Australian night hang in the air. I knew it was a compliment the way her lips turned up and her eyes became more kind, and I wanted to know what it meant, because I was young and vain and beautiful and cocky, and I devoured compliments. But for once I was wise enough to let it fill the air before destroying it.\n\nMy flat was close enough to the ocean that you could still hear those famous Newcastle waves crashing on the shore, close enough that you could smell the salt in the air, close enough that you could feel the ocean breeze. All that mixed with her sweet perfume and for a short while everything was absolutely perfect in the world. I blinked a few times simulating shutters on an expensive camera capturing the world. I knew I had to capture the moment because nothing would ever feel this good again. And I was right.",

Some people work really hard to make extra money so they can bring their significant other or family on a nice date to an upscale restaurant because the want to feel special. The atmosphere is pretty important in setting the mood. I remember dressing up and bring a girl to Capital Grill in Philly one time for a romantic night only to be sitting next to a guy in sweat pants and Philadelphia Eagles jersey which kinda killed the mood. Race has nothing to do with it, the restaurant is just trying to create an atmosphere of luxury for the customers to enjoy. They fucked up here by breaking the rules for a white kid and not a black kid. Hold EVERYONE to the same standard or break the rules for EVERYONE. Again, I have no real qualms with dress codes .",

(Meaning the exclusion was not because the hostess was explicitly racist but that racial bias played a role in noticing one child\u2019s dress code over another.) \n\nWe tend to not notice things that seem normal to us.\n\nFor me a couple of white kids in t-shirt, shorts and tennis shoes is not anything I would think twice about. If I was someone without a lot of exposure to other races, like so many suburban white folks, the mere fact that someone was another race might have me more alert as that is outside my \u201cnormal\u201d. Then being more alert you start to notice other details like the kid being in clothes that would not meet dress code when the white kids cloths never drew a red flag or second glance from them.\n\nThis type of implicit bias is common. It is why even when judges/juries/police aren\u2019t racist, POC tend to not get the benefit of the doubt as much as white people. The differences in look and speech make it harder for someone to see themselves or a love one in the person and therefore harder to sympathize with them.\n\nThis is why you see all these white judges talking about white offenders futures or stopping the proceeding when white teenage puts on alligators tears. They are more likely to see themselves in the accused. Compared to there only experience with POC which is filter exclusively through the justice system so tends skew interaction in a negative light.\n\nUnderstanding out implicit biases is important. \n\nFor a personal example I do not have implicit biases with race as growing up I had a variety of friends of different so was able to see that other races really aren\u2019t any different than my own family. I do however recognize I have major bias against heavily tattooed individuals. Most of my early aged experiences have been negative with these individuals and since I did not know anyone with heavy tattoos in my family or social space (no family of friends or anything like that) this has created a bias that heavily tattooed individuals are in general assholes. \n\nI have since worked with some amazing individuals who have had full sleeves on both arms and their necks covered and they were far nicer and more patient than I ever was but I still tend to be bias of the individuals that are heavily tatted until proven otherwise. Even though I understand this bias is not healthy.",

Sometimes they don't show, often they're late, a lot of the drivers are rude as shit, and there's no information/coordination to at least let people know about expected delays.\n\nOnce had my bus not show up TWICE and showed up 50 mins late for work because of it.\n\nOnce, one of the buses pulled out of their little pathway into the bus stop, was blocking the MAIN STREET OF THE CITY, and then parked it. I legit thought it was a protest. NOPE, googled later, absolutely no information, wasn't a protest. They somehow broke a bus in the perfect spot to block our main street and cause a buttload of traffic for the whole city.\n\nI'm disabled and on crutches. (one leg) Once had a bus driver let me on, waited for me to go halfway through the bus, THEN called me forward to see my bus pass. I go forward, yeah it takes time to get my wallet out, I show it, and then he just goes the moment he sees it. I fell. This guy reacted with \"Awww C'mon!\" in a tone that made it sound like he thought I was faking the fall or something.\n\nAnother bus driver once refused to let a 6-year-old off because he insisted the kid forgot to press the button to stop. (Kid insisted he pressed it, no idea who was right) Wasn't until half the bus was screaming at him cause the kid was understandably crying and afraid he was going to get lost, then he finally stopped a ways down the street to let him off.\n\nPeople call them out for this shit all the time on review websites, and of course they get the overly polite responses back that change absolutely nothing at all to the tone of \"that's not how it should be and we appreciate your feedback,\" and ultimately just seem really insincere. Because they are. They know they get paid either way until something drastic happens.\n\nPoliteness doesn't mean shit unless it's genuinely interested in helping. The lesson is **be** polite, not *talk* polite.",

That's why black people are accused of being \"aggressive\". It's gaslighting.\n\nImagine having to go through life like this. You occasionally get some asshole that treats you worse for no real reason, and when you stand your ground you are being treated like an irrational aggressive person.\n\nImagine that asshole is a cop.

He just talked about how I should see a psychiatrist. I\u2019ve been in constant communication with my psych since this started.\n\nI actually had the doctor come back in the room and calmly told him I did not appreciate being brushed off. I pointed out several symptoms and test results that are clearly not caused by depression. He was an absolute ass, but i actually got some answers.\n\nIt was so upsetting.

How we\u2019re told to be quiet or not get over excited. Even when it\u2019s a subject we\u2019re excited, passionate and knowledgeable about.  How any decimal above inside voice is seen as aggressive, how I\u2019m told I\u2019m intermediating even when they haven\u2019t  said shit to me\n\n\nThat\u2019s when I realized most girls/ woman are gaslight since childhood. I think boys/men are too in a different way. \n\nSo much so that some women refuse to show their emotions or are upset that they dare yell at their partner.  \u201caiTA fOr YeLlInG aT mY ParNtnEr AnD CalLiNg Him An AH AfTer He fuCked My Sis aNd eMptieD ouR saViNgs\u201d  \n\n\nYea yelling isn\u2019t great but it\u2019s part of an emotion, if you\u2019re going to focus more on my yelling and not why I\u2019m yelling then we get no where. I feel like this is how a lot of other modern movements get derailed in conversation.  They want the aggravated side to \u201cmanage\u201d themselves and \u201cspeak to them correctly\u201d or else.",

At most i think one family comes through they're not in dress code but I guess they're sitting outside so I can pull something out of my ass. Now another family comes in with the same violation and if someone's complains it looks like I'm not upholding the dress code. As bad luck would have it it was a black family and now it looks racist. \n\nKinda like being a referee. One odd tackle comes in and you let it go because it didn't endanger anyone. Then another similar tackle happens and you call the foul but now it looks like your playing favourites. It's not that you are playing favourites or it's subconscious or anything. The real problem is that you allowed one person to bend the rules and now instead big that one person someone else tries the same thing and you end up being an asshole for hoping that by letting the original problem go that it would be a one-off and solve itself.",

A restaurant that requires dress code here, is to avoid having these guys in their restaurants because they don't attract customers, they make tourists go away and makes the restaurant seem \"bad\"\n\n\nHow you dress isn't a money issue either\n\nI can buy from very cheap stores, a smart casual attire, business casual, etc etc\n\n\nThere is an issue though in Disco's where this is also mandatory but guards can block anyone on entry based on occupation. Men and specially Men of Color are obviously discriminated against",

Which is a fact. \n\nTo address your links:\n\nFirst link, literally an article about the video in the OP. Ok. \n\nSecond, third, and forth links, all about the history of dress codes and racism. Yet again, I never claimed dress codes don\u2019t have a history of racism and being used to kick certain races out of their establishments. \n\nNone of the links showed me any type of statistic on what % of dress codes are in place for racist reasons. You made the claim that 99% of the time dress codes are used to be racist. That\u2019s a shitty claim and I want you to back that up. \n\nAll four of your links were completely irrelevant to the point either of us are trying to make in this conversation.\n\nEdit: also just realized you said I\u2019m trying to \u201cdeny\u201d something?

In any event can we at least agree it\u2019s highly concentrated in certain places, and that\u2019s what matters most? Dismissing it as \u201cboth sides\u201d is kind of shitty for the same reason that \u201call lives matter\u201d is shitty. If you haven\u2019t personally witnessed it that\u2019s fine, but given the countless people who are targets of it and will tell you it\u2019s very real, could it be you just havent picked up on it? possibly bc youre not a target?\n\nI will say, i agree the folks on /r/conservative immediately downvote/remove overt racism. youll never see that. and i suspect the majority *believe* they are not racist. but that\u2019s precisely the point. what theyre on about is more abstract, but no less virulent. Lee Atwater put it best, way back in 1981 in his [infamous interview](https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/exclusive-lee-atwaters-infamous-1981-interview-southern-strategy/) about the southern strategy he pioneered:\n\n>\tYou start out in 1954 by saying, \u201cn****r, n****r, n****r.\u201d By 1968 you can\u2019t say \u201cn****r\u201d\u2014that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states\u2019 rights, and all that stuff, and you\u2019re getting so abstract. Now, you\u2019re talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you\u2019re talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is, blacks get hurt worse than whites.\u2026 \u201cWe want to cut this,\u201d is much more abstract than even the busing thing, uh, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \u201cn****r, n****r.\u201d",

They're really not getting a pass as you said, rather it should be understood as the plaintiffs party screwed the mother over for not handling their submissions or arguments carefully enough. You can find a similar, recent example of this in the prosecution of the Kyle Rittenhouse trail, look how that turned out.\n\nHowever, I fully stand for the women continuing her lawsuit and do believe she will reach a settlement. Going back to my previous comment, the son is okay and will grow up with this life lesson on people and racism. I do not believe racism will ever be abolished as it is a human experience.

As well I'm sure the Group has anti-discrimination training as most companies do, which would forestall the \"intentional or reckless\" part.\n\nThey also did not, apparently, provide written notice to the appropriate state or local authority, so it doesn't quality as a violation of the civil rights act.\n\nThe restaurant really wants to frame this as a bad employee and not a bad restaurant or company \u2014 and unless other people come forward or more evidence is found, that is what it looks like.",

Add that with the other family having one kid dressed exactly the same, and a second kid the same but with a button up on. Suddenly it looks very much like that manager intentionally forbade that family from dining for reasons other than the dress code. \n\nAlso, I'm all for requiring proof of seeking medical help for emotional damages. But I'm not sure how she's supposed to \"provide proof of the manifestation of damages\" for her son. If anything, that sounds like something that would be proven at trial, but again, it's hard because parents know their children, and it's quite possible he will need to seek therapy in the future for it. Depending on the cost, she may not have saught therapy up front, but could with settlement money. Note: not saying that I think that's what's what was going to happen, just that it's plausible. \n\nLastly, why the hell do I have notify the state?",

I told him my name and he asked if I was Scottish and I said \u201cNo, my mom is Irish\u201d and he said that we\u2019re neighbors and he gave me a second ball so I could have a second round of mini golf.

But once she pointed out the other kid in the same attire it should of been \"please have a seat just in the future know that we don't allow that dress code and I will inform the other family as well\".  Dumb hill to die on for some rules to be honest.  Gaurd vs Gaurdian training in the worst way.",

It's literally one bad night from burning down altogether. Therefore, I would see people and businesses doing things that would seem to be discriminatory or unfair on their face, but I eventually realized that these people are traumatized by what they have experienced and are acting out of some primordial self interest. It's how you get videos of Karen's screaming bloody murder when they get a little scared, it's because the last time she was in that situation it didn't end well for her. Restaurants in Baltimore are constantly barraged with individuals who are either not willing to pay, dine and dash, or presents such a customer service problem and complaint about the food that the restaurant ends up losing the sale and the food. Germantown, frederick, Ellicott city, columbia, gaithersburg, rockville, Bethesda have no where near the level of restaurant fuckery that inner city Baltimore has. You just have to understand that these restaurants are in a different universe. It's unfortunate it's sad it's unfair it's unjust, but hurt people hurt people.",

      "text": "Oh, this is from Baltimore. \n\nI guess this could have happened in lots of big cities, but Baltimore is especially big on this sort of thing - speaking as a guy who lived there for a while. \n\nIn fact, a few months after I first moved there, a white dude having grown up in a very, very white town in another part of country, I got turned away from a bar by a bouncer for wearing athletic wear. I wouldn't have shown up to a high-end restaurant like that for a variety of reasons and I generally default to preppy dress, but I was a bit shocked. I didn't make a scene or anything like that, but it struck me a touch odd since no bar anywhere near my hometown, or, likely, even in DC, would likely have a rule like that.  \n\nI eventually figured out how and why such rules exist there. It's hard to even talk about them without sounding like you're making excuses for businesses that act like this, but I got a decent number of imaginary internet points, so I can survive being downvoted into oblivion if that's what happens here. At the root, it comes from having large groups of people living in relative proximity to each other who, to be perfectly frank, really don't like each other very much. It's a patch work of neighborhoods, most of them dominated by a fairly specific population, race and class. And they've developed this strange (from an outsider's POV) set of written and unwritten rules about what you look like and how you act if you're \"crossing\" the \"lines\" or inhabiting a space designed to be an intersection of populations that may not coexist that often. It's not the Jim Crow South exactly, but it's also far from a post-racial world that maybe some people thought we were living in when Barack Obama got elected President by a big margin. \n\nThe 18-year old version of AnswerGuy301 would have absolutely responded, with zero hesitation, that there should be no \"lines\" and therefore no \"crossing\" of the \"lines.\" In the last quarter century or so, as you might imagine, I've spent quite a bit of time being disappointed. \n\nObviously these people in the video were badly mistreated, the employee was pretty clearly enforcing a de facto (if not necessarily de jure) racist policy, it likely contributed to further resentment, and we would all be better off if we didn't see this sort of thing anymore, in Baltimore or anywhere else...but if you lived in Baltimore you'd also know (unless you tried really hard to pretend not to know) why that's not going to be easy.",

Many locals know about this company and its history of not only racial incidents with guests, but horrible management of staff as well, and therefore won't bother going to their locations. Atlas is an awful company that has no place in Baltimore. Unfortunately, most people who visit Baltimore don't know or don't care enough about it, and continue dining at their properties. \n\nsource: worked at bars in Baltimore city from 2018-2021, have many friends and associates who worked for Atlas.",

No one wants to dress up, make reservations and spend $400 on an anniversary meal only to look over at a couple rednecks in their hunting gear at the bar getting lit and being loud. That\u2019s why nice restaurants avoid serving cheap beer or running happy hours. \n\nThe real issue here is that the other kid was allowed in. You either enforce the dress code or you don\u2019t.\n\nKids in general are a death sentence to a fancy restaurant. If your fancy place gets tagged as \u201cfamily friendly\u201d you may as well close. That\u2019s why a lot of really nice places don\u2019t open for lunch, have dress codes, don\u2019t have kids menus and require reservations. Children ruin the atmosphere and destroy the restaurant. Tables with children have dramatically lower check averages (due to cheap children\u2019s food and lower alcohol spending.) They\u2019ll also unapologetically leave their tables in absolute shambles. Cheerios scattered all over the floor and wedged between cushions, stepped on crayons ground into the flooring. You just pray they brought iPad and some headphones. \n\nDress codes are absolutely necessary not just for children but all guests at some restaurants. Generally these places are very up front about their requirements to avoid any embarrassment. If you make a reservation they\u2019ll tell you in detail what\u2019s required. Then they\u2019ll call back and confirm the reservation on the day and remind you again. They usually stash a few jackets in various sizes too if there\u2019s a jacket requirement. \n\nSome of it does frankly get a little racist in application and design but avoiding incidents like this is exactly why managers and hostesses exist. De-escalating and making reasonable accommodations is standard procedure. One thing I\u2019ve seen done is asking a family out of dress code to eat at a less visible table, usually tucked away in a corner or outside. That\u2019s generally only a special thing they do for regulars who usually don\u2019t bring their kids or otherwise spend a lot of money at the restaurant. Breaking that rule can lead to problems.",

(Just to clarify I would only refuse service for no shirts, lude clothing, or anything that would be non family friendly, like a shirt that may have like a naked woman)",

Maybe a different staff member sat them\u2026 he was on the patio, so maybe he went straight in through the gate outside instead of coming inside first, who knows. Most likely it\u2019s fully as racist as it seems\u2026 \n\nBut, This shit would happen ALL THE TIME at my old golf course where one guy would be let on in an outfit that broke the dress code and the other guy didn\u2019t\u2026. and as you can imagine at a golf course in Canada, there was not a black person in sight, so it wasn\u2019t racism so much as inconsistent enforcement of dress code by different staff members. \n\nThe appropriate response is \u201cyou\u2019re right. You make an excellent point. Clearly an exception was made for that child and we will extend the same courtesy to your son this time as well. In the future please adhere to the posted dress code.

But I'm saying that **if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other.** You follow me\u2014because obviously sitting around saying, \"We want to cut this,\" is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than \"N--, n--.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy) (editing n-word, and emphasis mine.)\n\n* Frank Wilhoit: \u201cConservatism consists of exactly one proposition \u2026There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind, alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.\u201d\n\n * The \"law\" here being the dress code.

Nothing wrong with telling others about your experience but it would be good to just go somewhere else and enjoy a meal without drama.  \n\nOr put it this way.... \n\nYou don't like me but I am willing to give you money anyway.

The white kid is wearing casual dress shorts and a non-athletic graphic t-shirt, and the black kid is clearly wearing athletic shorts and shirt. Those are different attires. The restaurant may or may not allow one and not the other. We don\u2019t know and we can\u2019t trust much of what the worker in the video said on the matter because he was clearly flustered to the point of not making sense. \n\n2. The white kid is outside. Sometimes restaurants have different dress codes outside and in. I live in Baltimore where this occurred and know a few restaurants in the area where that\u2019s the case. Again, we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case. \n\n3. Maybe the white kid or his family was a friend/family of someone working there and got to wear something less than appropriate (that\u2019s if the attire was less than appropriate, again we don\u2019t know) because his family know employees/owners. \n\nI\u2019m sure I could go on, but there\u2019s plenty of things this could be besides overt intentional race based bigotry. \n\nHell I just came up with another possibility.\n\n4. The white employees missed the white kid wearing inappropriate clothing by mistake and were too flustered with a camera in his face to admit/realize this, and was trying to (for whatever reason..) die on the hill he was standing on. \n\n5. The structural racism of society subconsciously made the white employee think that the white kids inappropriate clothing was passable because in his mind white people are usually better dressed, and it was Reuther \u201cclose enough\u201d or it literally seemed passable when it wasn\u2019t. (And remember it probably was technically passable, though we don\u2019t know for sure). But the black kid stood out in his mind and alerted him \u201cthis breaks dress code\u201d bc he has internalized biases.  \n\nThere\u2019s plenty of things here that this could be besides overt disgusting bigotry based on race.

He very quickly failed to define the supposed \u201cdress code\u201d, while ignoring the fact that the blatant double standard existed for the other kid out there.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: if there is indeed a proper dress code, and the guy\u2019s brain couldn\u2019t \u201ccompute\u201d as you said, why then did the double standard exist? Why was the white kid let in, but not this black kid?\n\nWhat would that have anything to do with the dude being on break or counting bills?\n\nBut yes, I cannot definitively say it is about race. However, the main difference here is the race of both children. And the likelihood of it being an issue of race is pretty high.\n\nThe official release by the restaurant chain also made it clear that upper management did not approve of this, and that the manager got suspended.

And in fact, it's CONTRARY to what the owner is saying. Then you'll say again that the owner is acting under pressure from the bad public relations fallout, and therefore you aren't going to count his statement... and will substitute your own speculative reasoning to assert that the manager was not fired for being racist \"in reality\".\n\nin sum, you're making up your own \"facts\", and are ignoring the actual facts, ONLY because it's convenient for your argument.\n\nThat's why you're unable to persuade anyone. your argument is shit, your opinion is debunked.",

However, instead of believing this is an intentional malicious racist practice, I think more likely this is just a result of bureaucratic bull shit rules that workers are forced to enforce. Like the white kid they bent the rules for was with a whole family and the rest of the family appears to be dressed nicely and it also appears they are holding a little bag, like a gift bag, like they are celebrating an occasion. That is much harder to deny that family as they are bringing in more money for the restaurant and everyone else looks nice and the kid looks really young. Also, the larger group means they\u2019re more likely to have more people be mad at you for enforcing this rule on a tiny kid and screwing over the whole family event. Your boss is also more likely to be mad at you for turning away a large group over this small kid\u2019s dress code violation and then having to hear about it. Then this mom comes in a party of two, randomly with a kid who looks bigger/older and the worker is like we are supposed to enforce this rule but I bent it for that larger group that was celebrating an event with a small child who broke the rules and now I don\u2019t want to bend it again because I am supposed to be enforcing this rule typically and you are a small group not obviously celebrating an event with a bigger older child and my manager would want me to not bend the rule in this case the worker thinks. I also can\u2019t see how that mom is dressed.",

Do you go around stating your intentions when out in public? How the hell am I supposed to know your intentions? All I can do in the moment is assume your intentions based on what you say and do. Nobody can read your mind. \n\nIf you crash into my car, it doesn't matter that you didn't mean to do it. You still fucking did it.

Just because someone isn't racist 99% of their life doesn't mean they still can't be racist in a given moment.\n\nIn the core of their being, they may not be a racist. However, that doesn't mean it's inaccurate to call them racist for doing or saying something racist unintentionally.\n\nIt's like being called a dick or an asshole.

It's less of an assumption and more of an educated guess. \n\nFor example, I have evidence of you hurling insults at me just because I dared to inject a different opinion on the topic. I never insulted you until you started hurling them at me. You assumed my intention was to insult you so you got defensive and lashed out like a child. Based on all of this, I can make an educated guess that you're kind of an asshole.\n\n>You can cry all you like but you\u2019re as wrong as it gets on this, you clearly just see racism everywhere because you assume intent like you\u2019re a mind reader even after admitting you aren\u2019t, now that\u2019s stupid\n\nI'm not even going to debate you on the asinine points you just made.

The fact you think someone\u2019s opinion of another person is established truth and fact is so beyond stupid i have to hope you\u2019re either joking or aren\u2019t actually aware of what you\u2019re saying. You literally said \u201cto them\u201d you admit it\u2019s a persons opinion yet double down on it being a fact, how are you this stupid? By your own logic, if my opinion is that you are a duck, then you are factually a duck, if my opinion is that you are French then you are factually French? How can you not understand that opinions are not facts or truth, your perception of something or someone is not a fact you absolute dumb fuck.\n\nYou are confusing the fact that humans can\u2019t read minds so we have to assume intent (at first, then we can use evidence to prove it) because there\u2019s no alternative, with thinking that your assumption is truth and fact. How you have this so mixed up is beyond me. Yes, in social interactions we have to make assumptions, i never said you can\u2019t make assumptions about intent, you seem to think i\u2019m saying that, i\u2019m not. What i\u2019ve said it that if you are going to assume someones intent, you have to be aware that you are likely wrong in your assumption, just because you often have to assume things doesn\u2019t mean your assumptions are right or that it\u2019s ok to make judgements like calling people racist based on your assumption. You have literally no proof that this guy is a racist, you have an awkward misunderstanding and miscommunication between three parties in an isolated incident and you assume racism? Says a lot about the way you think and it\u2019s not clever. You tried to imply i\u2019m unsociable, word of advice, assuming general negative intent about people based on isolated situations they are involved in is a good way to not have any friends.\n\nYou can assume i\u2019m an asshole. You\u2019d be purposely ignoring your own input into the situation and purposely ignoring the possibility that i\u2019m only being an asshole, in your opinion, to you based on how you interact. In that scenario i\u2019m not an asshole, i\u2019m just being abrasive to someone who is an asshole in my opinion, it\u2019s almost like perspective is relevant to assumptions which is why we should work in provable facts when trying to call people racist over a simple misunderstanding. If your opinion was fact then i wouldn\u2019t have friends and family that love and enjoy my company, which i do. See how dumb it is to assume things, especially when it\u2019s clear your assumptions are incredibly biased based on your perspective and wants. You\u2019re incredibly disingenuous and stupid to boot.\n\nYou think your opinion of the intent of someone you don\u2019t know is a fact? And you think that\u2019s a norma social interaction? Are you severely autistic or something? Wtf is wrong with you.\n\nLiterally not shifting the goalposts, you\u2019re just so stupid you can\u2019t understand the conversation hasn\u2019t changed. Why would we have a different standard than a court of law, the best standards society can come up with for fairness, truth and justice? You\u2019re now arguing that it\u2019s ok to wrongly assume things about people just because it\u2019s not in a court? You think it\u2019s ok to purposely assume someones intent and then treat that as fact? I fee sorry for anyone that knows you, you\u2019re literally fucking crazy.\n\nI didn\u2019t say you were arguing for the legality of it, get some reading comprehension, fucking hell dude. I\u2019m saying that your ideas are so fundamentally stupid and wrong that not a single successful society in the world thinks what your saying is a good way to actually find truth or facts. You\u2019re so stupid you don\u2019t even grasp this when i spell it out for you. Fucking christ get help.\n\nYou literally said that if your opinion of an isolated incident is that a person is racist, then they are racist as a fact. You said that. You have said that being accidentally racist, in your opinion, means someone is a racist, 100%. You may not realise this is what you are arguing, it is and it\u2019s as stupid now as it was when you first made the argument. Either that or you\u2019re trying to back pedal because what you\u2019re saying is asinine. And before you go \u201ci didn\u2019t literally use those exact words\u201d I\u2019m purposely rewording what you\u2019ve said to point out how stupid what you\u2019ve said is, i\u2019m not attempting ti directly quote you here.\n\nI never said you can\u2019t make assumptions. In my opinion, you are an ignorant dumb fuck, that isn\u2019t a fact, it\u2019s my opinion based on things that you\u2019ve said that I think are stupid. I can go through why i think they\u2019re stupid and why thinking stupid things makes you stupid and that can help support my opinion. I have a lot of evidence of you being a dumb fuck, you think your opinion is a fact, there\u2019s evidence you are stupid. You have evidence to support your opinion of racism in this instance and i\u2019ve given counter points to why the evidence doesn\u2019t show what you think it does, we can disagree on the evidence but whether the guy is racist or not is still our opinion and because the burden of proof is on you as the accuser of him being a racist, you must prove it, until then he isn\u2019t a racist. That\u2019s basic scientific and legal methods to get the truth, if you don\u2019t use them then you don\u2019t want truth, you just want to call people racist because you\u2019re a weirdo who gets off on racial issues.\n\nAn opinion based on evidence that i\u2019ve pointed out is not conclusive at all and is in fact an isolated incident with multiple examples of no discrimination based on race and multiple differences between the involved parties that have nothing to do with race. So basically you are saying your opinion that the guy is racist is based on your interpretation, which i\u2019ve pointed out is biased, and in your mind that is a fact? Fuck me you\u2019re so off the deep end it\u2019s a miracle you haven\u2019t drowned\u2026or a curse, either way you need help. You\u2019re view of your own self importance is scary, you really aren\u2019t smart and you think your opinions are facts, that\u2019s a scary and sad combination.\n\nI didn\u2019t insult you because you \u201cdared\u201d to question me. I\u2019m calling you an idiot because you keep arguing that opinions are facts, which they aren\u2019t, like an idiot. Do you have to assume that anyone who thinks you\u2019re dumb is insecure to protect your fragile ego? You\u2019re just dumb dude, get help.\n\nYou can have the opinion that based on our interactions, i\u2019m an asshole. It\u2019s funny you don\u2019t realise that assuming i\u2019m an asshole 100% based on our disagreement just supports my point that you make sweeping judgements with lacking information and it makes you look stupid. My girlfriend doesn\u2019t think i\u2019m an asshole, neither do my friends or loving family. It\u2019s almost like your opinion isn\u2019t a fact you cretin.\n\nWhat\u2019s funny is your last paragraph is so much projecting from you i\u2019d be laughing if it wasn\u2019t so cringe and sad. Maybe read that last paragraph of yours and take your own advice freak. \n\nOnce more for your monkey brain. Opinion is not fact.",

The shoes and shirt argument can be made but for you to say there\u2019s no way to interpret that the black kid is breaking the dress code is just false, he is breaking the dumb dress code that the business has. It can be argued the white kid also is but they are not wearing the same kind of clothing and to argue they are is literally demonstrably false, the styles, materials and designs are completely different.\n\nNo, it\u2019s a clear indicator that this guy was being a jerk and unwilling to actually solve the issue by speaking with the person who seated the white family. You say it proves discrimination because a white kid in completely different clothing was allowed but you ignore that other black people were also allowed, by your logic that disproves discrimination based on race. You said if the white kid is allowed and the black kid isn\u2019t then that\u2019s proof of discrimination, well other black people were allowed so that disproves discrimination by your own arguments logic.\n\nTo me it\u2019s ideological race baiting to instantly assume the issue is racial discrimination without any evidence beyond the people involved were different races.",

Not sure where this took place, but I'm assuming it was in the U.S A., which is where I live. We are members of multiple gated communities and golf resorts, which are also country clubs. Our community is filled with restaurants that cater to people like us, who golf and live in those areas. BUT....the restaurants in our community do NOT refuse service to KIDS who are dressed like KIDS. This is ridiculous. My own kids wear gym shorts, tee shirts, flip flops, Crocs, etc. to the restaurants behind gates & it's FINE. SO LAY OFF.",

The mother is using racism to change the rules of the restaurant, this is why we still have racial issues, if people don't get their ways they pull out the racism card. I bet it states on the doors that a dress code is in effect and followed. That boys mother didn't care and decided to make a scene anyway. If I had been the judge overseeing this case, I would have thrown it out, the mother is clearly in the wrong! The \"other kid\" is OUTSIDE!!!! Apparently her mind is so full of hatred, she didn't notice that!",

His eyes visually changed when he realised he had said something that was wrong.  He knew at that moment that he was in fact in the wrong.  There was nothing more the woman had to convince him of because he was already convinced of everything at that moment.\n\nAnd yet he chose to stand his ground and pull out all kinds of illogical, inaccurate, and dishonest excuses out of his urethra all the way to the end, pretending to be emotionless and professional so that the emotional woman would look more like a Karen.\n\nThe man is not necessarily a bad human being because he initially unknowingly made racist judgments, but he IS a bad human being for continuing to stand his ground when he actually realised he was in the wrong.",

Doesn\u2019t change the fact that a 9 year old kid had to go through that, but it\u2019s a good outcome.\n\nEdit: Just removed my link to the article because it\u2019s not working for some reason, but here\u2019s a quote from the restaurant:\n\n\u201cWe are sickened by this incident and we sincerely apologise to Marcia Grant, her son and everyone impacted by this painful experience.\n\n\u201cThey deserved better.\u201d",

The person that allowed the other family has every right to have the individual that allowed written policy to be violated standing right there being held to account for their decisions. Living in some fantasy where no one is responsible for their actions leads to scenarios like this, Princess. Maybe think about the black family that wants to be treated with dignity and respect by being seated. The (assumed) mother recording the incident requests a reason why they are not allowed to sit and eat while another (white) family is. She is not being disrespectful or rude, but she has every right to see that the responsible party is properly trained in customer service and employer policy. This is pretty basic common sense stuff, Princess.",

As a co-owner of my own successfully thriving business (my wife and I fully own it but I manage all operations while she fulfills the HE and assists with some management duties in my absence) since 2004, I can tell you for a FACT that losing one employee but gaining a loyal customer and their compadres is much more crucial to the survival of the business. Said employee who refuses to adhere to the written rules and legal policies of any business provides no means of legal recourse for the employee once they walk away and saves customers and/or increase the word of mouth advertising that they subsequently perform. When they see that \u201cthe boss\u201d will immediately walk over and describe to the employee what the correct way to handle any given situation in the middle of the situation (if it is having an immediate effect on the well being of the security of the business), that customer understands that they are the priority, they like and appreciate that I care. I have had employees leave because they didn\u2019t like being told that the manner in which they were performing was not in line with our standards and thought they were the boss who could interpret the rules as they seen fit. I let them walk. It didn\u2019t hurt me. It hurt them. They were/are paid well, trained well, have low cost insurance at a great financial loss to me (well, my business as I wrote it off) and have extreme schedule flexibility. I know not all places are this way, but most places do have lawyers that back their rules and policies to ensure little to no liability to the business. I\u2019ve had many customers bring in friends and family and recount whatever issue they had or seen and how it was handled and therefore brought me business. They fed my family. They allowed us to have a second home. All this shit is basic common sense and human decency.. really.",

She spoke to his mom if he had gotten written up too, and agreed searching his bag, he did not. \n\nSo my mom, getting fed up with the teacher because she made me miss my bus home [that's another story] and lashes something with the other mom on the phone. The two of us wore the shirt again, this time when I got written up, I was sent to the principal's office where my mom was called in. While there she mentioned the other kid and had him brought in, wearing the same shirt but no write up.\n\nThis was the start of my mom becoming great friends with my principal.",

Any excuse will do\".\n\nHe just don't want her eating there.  Any excuse will do.  And quite frankly, I'm surprised he even bothered to give a reason.  These days after the Masterpiece cake lawsuit, no excuse will do just as well as any.  There are signs in businesses everywhere around the U.S. stating they reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.  No excuses necessary - as long as it's not specifically a few things laid out by law.  But really, no law says they can't just make some excuse up, or even apply their excuses selectively.  He can be as racist as he wants so long as he doesn't say it's because of race.\n\nAny excuse will do.",

Like in summer it\u2019s logical to have shorts but business casual dictates you need a dressier type of short. Think of like what a golfer would wear. Some places will deny entry if you aren\u2019t wearing a collared and/or buttoned shirt but those are getting fewer and fewer. All that being said dress codes for children are dumb.",

Some pricey places have people in t-shirts, jeans, and cheap-ass costco sneakers.

The white child was wearing virtually the same clothes, just different colors. Gym shorts and a tee shirt.

I think we were denied service at a country club that my Grandfather belonged to, even though they knew who we were. My mom said that they were all blatantly staring at me.

A strong, not racist manager would've immediately realized what was happening and allowed them to dine in, even discounting their meal or buying them some apps or something, putting them with the best server clocked in. If it was an actual dress code issue, he should've allowed it regardless and simply just informed them that it is normally a rule, and likewise either say the same to the other family or at least explain you weren't aware at the time or didn't know there was another child not following their code. \n\nThere is no reason for this manager to be like this. He is either racist or extremely weak minded. Weak minded bc you could argue that his GM was there and telling the guy how to handle it or whatever. A weak minded person  \"is just following orders.\" Had this been me back when I was a bar manager, I would've comped their entire meal and maybe bring the kid a Togo desert or something, talk to the other family before they leave, find out why TF I wasn't notified about the other kid, and have a talk with whoever started denying this mother's service in the first place, and strongly tell them \"ya, don't deny service to a fucking child unless they're being unruly. He has basketball shorts on and it's lunch time. Let him eat\"",

Afterwards we went back to our hotel and the dad wanted to let us play in the pool they had. The pool was kind of behind the hotel so you couldn't really see it without going back there but you see enough of it. Anyway, when the dad asked the attendant where the pool was, they told them that the pool was closed at the moment. We thought nothing of it and started walking away. Then I remember hearing people playing and having a good time. Sure enough the pool was open and there were about 10-15 white people in there laughing and playing. I don't really remember what the dad said and I didn't even understand why they told us the pool was closed until years later.  But I remember my mom telling me at some point that here in this country we will always be treated differently but never treat anyone else the way you don't want to be treated. She also told me we'll always have to work a little bit harder and to go out there and prove them wrong. There's more stuff but that's all I can think of right now.",

It\u2019s just super unfortunate that there won\u2019t always be a perfect counter example every time this shit happens. It\u2019s easy to stay cool when all evidence is on your side. It\u2019s got to be pretty damn tough when you\u2019ve experienced something like this and it happens again and one of two things is actually happening.\n\n1. The restaurant is actually enforcing their policy consistently, but past experiences like this have biased you to think it is because of the way you look regardless of the truth.\n\n2. The restaurant is actually just discriminating and you know it, but there\u2019s not anything you can do about it.",

There's no such thing as an athletic shirt. Basketball shorts made the other boys outfit \"athletic\". The military makes the same distinction, if there's no belt loops they're athletic shorts/pants and cant be worn in public because it's not \"professional\". \n\nThis waiter/manager was just enforcing the dress code of a higher end, what, brunch place? A policy he probably doesn't care about himself. He's floundering because the lady filming is trying to racially charge a non racial situation and he's uncomfortable. The company pulled a knee jerk reaction and laid off some innocent dude to save face. Like they give a fuck. \n\nWhy create imaginary battles for yourselves when there's real ones to be fought. I've had buddies of mine of all colors get kicked out of clubs and bars for not meeting dress code which changes daily, hell I have and I'm white. We dont go posting videos of us throwing a tantrum at the bouncer for barring us entry. \n\nThis whole video made me lose a few braincells and I feel worse for the worker than anyone else.",

We all know it. In fact, in the past few years, it's become so prevalent and highlighted in the media. I think there's been enough fighting and confrontation and riots. I'm just trying to say, there are other methods of combating such treatment, other than anger and shouting at the person , escalating the issue, or whatever the purpose of this was. You don't change a person's perspective by doing that. If you really want to change, then be the bigger person. \n\nWhat do you think other people feel when watching this? If I were black, I'd be pissed and develop more hatred towards white people. You want to change people's perspective, then don't foster more hatred. \n\nAll I see is one person making a mistake and the other person unable to control temper and lashing out for her satisfaction. \n\nTLDR: For people downvoting me, read what I wrote first sentence. I said this is fucked up and she should be angry and I'm not arguing whether this was racist or not. That's for you to  interpret. I'm just saying her reaction is just as immature and short sighted.\n\nLet's make the world a better place, that starts with everyone accepting the current state and moving forward in the right direction.",

I'm saying that this is more of former than the latter. Not saying that you shouldn't stand up for injustice and some people will argue that the mom stood her ground and taught her son a valuable lesson but you and I both know that there has been a lot of violence and hatred already, dare I say enough to raise awareness at least.\n\nAlso just as people are quick to jump to conclusion that this is white vs black, take a step back and see it as a customer getting bad treatment from an employee. That's how the rest of the world, not black, sees it. You have to also see it from the other person's perspective as well. Or keep fighting and never progress.",

Its an easy thing to focus on, just yell racist when you dont understand something when you are a minority and woke people will agree as they are so afraid to be called racists. Also an awesome way to stomp through life and yell racism at everyrhing while trading to get your way like a little todller.",

No matter what u think about dress codes if they have one they should follow it so if the kid wasn't up to standard he shouldn't be let in, now the white kid also shouldn't of been let in and that was a seriously unfair moment the worker should not of argued about semantics of the situation since the only justifiable reason why the white kid was let in was a mistake on the restaurant/staff. The best way he could of handled it was saying that was a mistake on the staff for letting them in and he didn't realize and he apologized for the inconvenience, but he still can't let them in since if he keeps making exceptions at that point the dress code becomes less a rule and more of a request.",

Could it be that uncle Billy is just a shitty employee? No, definitely illegal aliens.\nBut yet they never speak Ill of the CEO of XYZ corporation that hires the illegal immigrants because under the threat of deportation can be paid a fraction of the normal pay rate of a non illegal.\nAs this is just one example of many different situations, but it illustrates how hatred for a particular group can be baked in at a subconscious level.  \n\nGrandpa bitched about illegals taking jobs, dad did too, so I must hate them for the same reason. And this will evolve to a thought that the reason I live in a shitty town in a shitty house, I drive a shitty car, and it's all the fault of illegal immigrants taking all the good paying jobs. And I hate them for it.  I do find it interesting that it's always the \"good paying jobs\". You never here people bitching about how all the jobs at McDonalds have been all taken by (insert any minority group). \n\n\n\nRacism is a choice a learned trait. It does not come naturally.",

Now that nobody has class or a sense of shame, we feel simply because we can afford it, we should enjoy it, however we see fit. It's a classic example of money, no class.

The Jim Cary movie is shipped as the \u201cwhite\u201d comedy and Scary Movie was shipped as the \u201cblack\u201d comedy.\n\nWhile waiting in line we all whitneesed multiple people buy tickets without their ID. My mother paid specific attention to this because she had left hers in the car.\n\nShe sent my uncle back to get it but meanwhile we were coming up in the line.\n\nSure as shit white guest after white guest purchase tickets to me myself and Irene without presenting ids.\n\nWhen my mother ask she is stopped and must show ID. My mother was well into her 30s there no chance she was mistaken for under aged.\n\nIf it\u2019s policy abs you have to do it for everyone fine then why did we watch you not ID The last three guest?\n\nIs a racial thing? Maybe not. But when my mom asked to speak to the manager he came out and the first thing he said was, \u201cmaim scary movie is rated R\u201d\n\nWho said we were here to see scary movie?? Odd assumption no?",

Thing is, I've seen people get passed the dress code all kinds of ways.  Some guy was eating there in a wife-beater and jeans!  Apparently he was a football player with the local team.  On one occasion, I saw some guy with attitude get turned away and a guy who was polite and friendly to the hostess get allowed in.  Point is, it's never about race; it's just plain old favoritism.",

It was the middle of the summer and I just wanted to have a drink with my mates in the pub, but apparently not in my shorts. I protested to security, saying they're literally letting people go past wearing the same thing, but they didn't care about them, just me apparently. \n\nThe mistake here seems to be that the white kid should never have been allowed into the restaurant in the first place. Whether that was racially motivated or not is the question. \n\nAlso, now that I think about it, the bigger mistake is why the fuck can't a kid wear athletic shorts? He's a fucking kid, why should any of this dress code apply to a kid?",
