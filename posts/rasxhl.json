This kicked off the age of engineering ways to turn that power into goods and processes.\n\nThat mattered because it meant we could now produce far more than we needed, from food first, then textiles, increasingly complex parts, and so on. With that overhead cleared, it gave us more time to think, to learn, and to invent even more stuff. One man working an assembly line could produce tools used to multiply the productivity of others wishing to purchase those tools. That makes the math go exponential.\n\n\n I can't believe other top comments implying how we organize our economy and what god we believed in was anything but coincidental.",

Obviously new supplies will be found or previously untappable sources become available (e.g. shale gas & oil) can extend this. And likewise if the supply starts running out then that naturally will cause prices to rise, which drives down demand in favor of other alternatives. And even without rising prices demand is going down, as there are incentives to switch to other energy sources. \n\nThat is enough time to find some other alternative to fossil fuels, there is a ton of research into replacements from algae or forest matter. As of yet they are inferior to fossil sources, but that need not always be true, and for certain uses they can replace fossil carbon sources. \n\nAnd even in the absolute worst case scenario, oil & gas are technically renewable, just in the time scales of tens of millions of years. Which is too long in the scale of human civilisation, but not when considering the time until the earth becomes unliveable (1 billion years).",

The US invented nukes first and all sorts of other tech, which the Soviets then had to steal.

Autocratic governments like the USSR and CCP like to waste money on \"prestige\" projects they can brag about, which don't actually mean anything. FYI, the US put an astronaut in space only 3 weeks later, and went higher. So what? You think I feel insecure or inferior or cucked by that? LOL mcretard.\n\n3. Actual metrics that matter and are meaningful: [In terms of countries with the most satellites, the United States has the most with 1,897 satellites, China is second with 412, and Russia third with 176.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite) \n\nNow go fuck a cow then get shot in a favela.",

For example, back in the middle ages, two Christian soldiers on opposite sides of the world could have never met, had nothing in common, but could fight for a common cause. Very good read!",

That work ended up influencing minds which in turn influenced Einstein, who won the Nobel prize for the experiment that showed that indeed light behaved as a stream of particles.\n\nAnd according to the Greeks the atomism concepts dated back before their own dark ages (~1200 BCE - 700 BCE), though we no longer have any direct or quoted primary sources to attest to that.\n\nI do wonder at just what the world would look like without those dark ages setbacks.",

Since fewer people were needed to grow crops, excess labor could be used by factories for manufacturing, beginning the industrial Revolution and the rapid population growth you see in that graph\n\nUnironically thank god for the Black Death",

We aren\u2019t the first to mention that the world today seems to be going crazy. This sort of thing is not normal for human societies. There is good reason to believe that primitive man suffered from less stress and frustration and was better satisfied with his way of life than modern man is. It is true that not all was sweetness and light in primitive societies. Abuse of women was common among the Australian aborigines, transexuality was fairly common among some of the American Indian tribes. But it does appear that GENERALLY SPEAKING the kinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding paragraph were far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society.\n\n46. We attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions. It is clear from what we have already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal conditions to which modern society subjects people. But it is not the only one. Before dealing with disruption of the power process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the other sources.",

But it is also disrupted because of those human drives that fall into group 3: the drives that one cannot adequately satisfy no matter how much effort one makes. One of these drives is the need for security. Our lives depend on decisions made by other people; we have no control over these decisions and usually we do not even know the people who make them. (\u201cWe live in a world in which relatively few people\u2014maybe 500 or 1,000\u2014make the important decisions\u201d\u2014Philip B. Heymann of Harvard Law School, quoted by Anthony Lewis, New York Times, April 21, 1995.) Our lives depend on whether safety standards at a nuclear power plant are properly maintained; on how much pesticide is allowed to get into our food or how much pollution into our air; on how skillful (or incompetent) our doctor is; whether we lose or get a job may depend on decisions made by government economists or corporation executives; and so forth. Most individuals are not in a position to secure themselves against these threats to more [than] a very limited extent. The individual\u2019s search for security is therefore frustrated, which leads to a sense of powerlessness.",

It is part of the nature of things, it is no one\u2019s fault, unless it is the fault of some imaginary, impersonal demon. But threats to the modern individual tend to be MAN-MADE. They are not the results of chance but are IMPOSED on him by other persons whose decisions he, as an individual, is unable to influence. Consequently he feels frustrated, humiliated and angry.\n\nThus primitive man for the most part has his security in his own hands (either as an individual or as a member of a SMALL group) whereas the security of modern man is in the hands of persons or organizations that are too remote or too large for him to be able personally to influence them. So modern man\u2019s drive for security tends to fall into groups 1 and 3; in some areas (food, shelter etc.) his security is assured at the cost of only trivial effort, whereas in other areas he CANNOT attain security. (The foregoing greatly simplifies the real situation, but it does indicate in a rough, general way how the condition of modern man differs from that of primitive man.)",

A single ocean freighter ship could replace a fleet of wooden transports - be they steam or wind. The high value of spice and goods from India would naturally collapse as they were no longer such a commodity.\n\nIn 1869 the Suez Canal cut the costs even further by allowing freight to bypass the horn of Africa, further reducing the cost of transport and thus increasing the market supply.\n\nIt is simply nearsighted and frankly ignorant to claim that \"the British mismanaged India\". India's fate had been sealed once the industrial revolution started, and it comes as no surprise at all, to me, that India's share of the global GDP would collapse due to the *national* failure to develop anything. India's elite class, India's wealthy got fat off these profits. The British were more than happy to buy goods at whatever price *the Indians* would sell them for. If your only exports were ores, plants or shellac, then when artificial shellac or improved agriculture techniques are discovered, what will you have? If Mines in Africa, China, America are discovered which are closer to Europe, what will you do?\n\nIt was not the Crown's duty to bequeath upon India sovereignty over the inventions of others. The Crown's duty in India was to not extract so much tax that the Indians would starve, it was to provide a military defense and law to protect the peace, and to make sure slavery was abolished for good. These were achieved, for the most part.\n\nBy popular demand, they left. Since then, India has been mostly worse off. but thankfully not as badly off as they were before the British arrived.",

A few were as young as 10, though nearly all were age 16 or 17. Most were girls wed to adult men an average of four years older.\n\nChild marriage \u2013 or marriage before age 18 \u2013 is dangerous. Even at age 16 or 17, regardless of spousal age difference, child marriage:\n\n1. Can easily be forced marriage, since minors have limited legal rights with which to escape an unwanted marriage (typically they are not even allowed to file for divorce);\n\n2. Is a human rights abuse that produces devastating, lifelong repercussions for American girls, destroying their health, education, economic opportunities and quality of life; and\n\n3. Undermines statutory rape laws, often covering up what would otherwise be considered a sex crime. Some 60,000 marriages since 2000 occurred at an age or spousal age difference that should have been considered a sex crime\n\n\nDid you even read it? \n\nIm 100% against pedophila as the next working class american. But it counts marriage between a 17 year old and 18 year old as child marriage. As if it was the same as a 7 year old with a 37 year old. \n\nNeither is good, but one is in a massive difference of worse than the other. \n\nI view a marriage between a 10year old, and 25+ year old as evil. I view marriage betwren 16 and 17, as irresponsible. Theres a world of difference. \n\nIll read more through it, but it reeks of poor statistical usage/terminology and cherrypicked data.",

If they have any sort of spirituality it's of the animist kind, linked to the natural world.\n\nNeolithic humans: settled groups of people, increasingly large populations, some people specialize (artisans, tool makers, etc.) and an administration class emerges, with leaders not being leaders solely because of brute force but more of a complex web of influence over the peasants. Then, some cunt realizes he doesn't want to toil in the field but doesn't have connections by birth or otherwise to the king, and he's above average IQ and a bit sociopathic so he starts to make up stories about the rain god and the lake god and the sun god, based on patterns he observed. He calls himself high priest and asks for a small portion of grains and chicken so he can talk to the harvest gods on the peasants' behalf. The king realizes that cunt is pretty useful at keeping the status quo. 8000 years later, we have the Vatican and the Medina n' shit. Boom.",

Now you have Christianity coming along saying God wants you to believe in Jesus or be punished forever. And then the next logical question is. \"If God wants us to believe in Jesus so much why doesn't he just make us?\" Now there are no logical reasons for god to exist and punish people for not believing so the Christians pull out, The free will stuff. But it really isn't free will. Again god is the mugger in the street, \"Believe in Jesus or go to hell forever. It's your choice.\" Like it's only a choice in the most literal of ways. I would say using Alcoms Razer pretty much just proves, that God doesn't care about free will and all this stuff Christians do, is manipulations and trying to explain away the major plot holes in their logic.",

I know this as someone who used to watch people like Thunderfoot years and years ago. The arguments I believed then are actually not as strong as you might think, and seem to miss the mark when you consider the big picture. \n\nThe bible as an example contains thousands of years of human experience and stories told about truths, passed down through generations. These books were shaped by the cultures that came to be yet these stories survived. These books shaped civilisation as we know it and contain meaningful lessons, the bible in particular shaped the entirety of Western civilisation. This isn't my opinion, it is a fact. That doesn't mean that Noahs arc or the garden of Eden happened literally, but consider what those stories represent and why they survived for literally thousands of years (considering natural selection principles apply to these forms of \"memes\" as well).",

I've heard J Peterson peddle this stupid shit to incels for like years now. It's getting quite old.\n\nIn reality it's a mixed bag, christianity definitely helped and pushed people in the right \"moral\" direction. But it wasn't for the right reasons.\n\nI mean, do you really expect me to believe that people who literally believed a woman has to orgasm to conceive a child were any kind of moral powerhouse? People were literally just about as dumb as the next religion in christianity. Of course, these kind of \"values\" were useful in medieval times where people were literally fighting over everything. A medieval society where women have \"freedom\" is not going to perform well, probably.\n\nYou can argue about literacy, and the other arguments. Religion definitely helped us get out of ooga booga times faster. That much is clear.\n\nBut that literally ends there. After that, there's literally no way you can convince me religion or christianity was any kind of path to what we have today. If you're going to parrot Peterson and tell me that all of our western values are thanks to christianity, well, go suck him off if you love him that much. We literally had key values like democracy, freedom of speech, etc. in ancient greece and rome. Like, what the fuck did christianity do to promote freedom of speech and democracy? LOL. Are you kidding me? This is some kind of americo-centric view the way I see it.\n\nAfterwards it was the inverse. You geniuses do realize that it was blasphemy to state literal facts about the solar system, anything that went against the narrative of the church was literally a heathen thing to do. Daring to believe the earth wasn't the center of everything got you absolutely ridiculed. \n\nAfter religion did it's part to nudge people in the right direction (again, most of it was for the wrong reasons but it worked out because you don't always do things for the right reasons to advance as a civilization) it was a hinderance to progress, which it literally remains so to this day.\n\nHumanism during the renaissance was probably one of the biggest factors on pushing people into science and advancement instead of autistic big man in the sky ideologies.",

By being religious, humans were able to look past their own selfish desires, develop moral codes, and most importantly were able to believe they were in the same community even 1000 miles apart. Without religion people never would have formed large societies compromised of hundreds of thousands of people. Today, I think that religion has no purpose anymore, but it\u2019s necessary for civilization to form and for people to look towards a greater good for humanity.",

Expeditions to unknown lands and routes are an expensive affair, and only those who have the money (clergy, in this case) would be able to fund it. As a result, apart from the obvious reason of finding new trade routes, the spread of religion (Christianity) became a major factor in their expansion.    \n\n\nYour logic also works, but kingdoms/colonial powers need a 'justified reason' to expand outwards. Well, technically it would all be power and control, but they need a pretense of 'bringing culture', whatever that means. For several European powers, that culture was the religion of Christianity.",

And decided to spread the gospel on this shithole of a website.\n\nHere's a history lesson:\n\nbefore Christianity the arabian penisula south of the levant was a shithole of Bedouin tribes with which no classical civilization wanted to interact.\n\nRome was a declining state, nobody could help it even if massive amounts of copium where handed to every citizen. The empire was simply spread out too far for the communication technology of the time. The barbarian invasion where inevitable and they were gonna fuck every bit of the empire. Hundreds of different tribes with no need of the written word, ready to use every piece of paper in the empire to wipe their ass and warm their tents.\n\nChristianity gave the empire a cohesive religion. With Christianity as a belief it was much easier for power to condense under a single person. Not to mention the ENOURMOUS amount of books, text and manuscripts preserved by the ORTHODOX BYZANTINE EMPIRE.\n\nAlso Christianity convinced those barbarian tribes to \"centralize\" power under kingdoms and kings, and start writing things down. If romans where still pagans, adapting to the culture of the ruling barbarians would have been extremely easy. But when you worship one single god and your rulers worship several either they give up and you give up. As a ruler who doesn't have enough power to influence religious beliefs its much easier to just convert to a different religion.\n\n600s Mohammed forms Islam. From a purely secular perspective, the formation of Islam could not have existed if not for Judaism and Christianity. And Islam was a brilliant tactical move. Remember those Bedouins? with different cultures, gods and interpretations? Now they finally had a cohesive force to unite them: religion. Next they went north, they saw, they conquered. Islam didn't PRESERVE classical writings, they TOOK them from conquered Byzantine and Sassanid territories and KEPT them.\n\nAlso do you wanna know why the renaissance happend? You guessed it, COUNTLESS scribes and monks from Constantinople, the city of Orthodox Christianity. Took as many text as they could and brought them to western europe.\n\nAlso just the idea that there were no advancements in 1000 years of human history is frankly insulting to the ingenuity of the human brain.\n\nTLDR: The Migration Period was the a driving force behind the largest decline in the history of human civilizations. And if it weren't for Christianity and Islam, we'd be shitting on streets today.",

Al-Ghazali.\n\nHe believed that nothing could be known apart from God and Islam. Furthermore, it was futile\u2014and wrong\u2014to believe otherwise. Many philosophers, lacking the scientific knowledge to create a comprehensive view of the world apart from religion, were unable to refute him. Al-Ghazali\u2019s ideas took hold. As a result of The Incoherence of the Philosophers, philosophy sharply declined among Sunnis. Incessant warfare may also have played a role in the popular swerve toward conservatism. Al-Ghazali later devoted himself to Sufism and developing political and philosophical thought rooted in Islam. Largely due to Al-Ghazali, the foundations of the Islamic Golden Age began to crumble, and continued assaults by Mongols and Crusaders cemented the Golden Age\u2019s fate. Al-Ghazali was worried that when people become favorably influenced by philosophical arguments, they will also come to trust the philosophers on matters of religion, thus making Muslims less pious.

                      "text": "The myth is that there were dark ages at all.\n\nApparently linking to subreddits isn't allowed, so here's the text of one good answer: There are a number of reasons why the \"Dark Ages\" is a really terrible descriptor for the European Middle Ages, and I will list some of them here.\n\nFirst, the popular understanding of the term \"Dark Ages\" is almost entirely misguided and incorrect, promoted by centuries of misinformation and bias. It implies that as soon as the Western Roman Empire fell in the late 5th Century, that all of Europe was suddenly transformed into this backwards dystopia where peasants rolled around in the mud all day, fat kings feasted on -turkey- legs, and this guy called the Pope burned books and Crusaded around for the hell of it. The common understanding is hyperbolic and ludicrous and severely downplays the many developments and achievements that were made during the Middle Ages. \nBuilding off of the previous statement, the Fall of the Western Roman Empire (nominally) in AD 476 is far too often seen as the end of civilization in Europe. The public has conveniently been misinformed that the Roman Empire fell in AD 476, which is completely and totally false. The Byzantine Empire, which was an entire half of the Roman Empire, survived for another thousand years in the East, and for most of that time, was not only a superpower of the Mediterranean, but also made notable strides in the realms of science, technology, philosophy, theology, medicine, and many other fields. This fact is unfairly downplayed because of centuries of Western animosity towards the Byzantines, which is now thankfully being changed by recent scholarship.\nThe Western Europeans, despite undergoing a short period of recovery after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, were not degenerates. It is often toted that the Western Europeans did nothing for about 300 years after the fall of the Western Empire, which isn't true. This was the period where the great kingdoms and empires of the West began to form. To defy this misconception, read up on the Merovingians, the Lombards, and the formation of the Holy Roman Empire. You'll find out some pretty impressive stuff. \nThe contrast between the Renaissance and the \"Dark Ages\" is not as pronounced as you might think (and it is so because the idea of the \"Dark Ages\" began during the Renaissance). Many of the \"achievements\" of the Renaissance have precedents in 10th-12th Century Byzantium and elsewhere. After reading up on various works of Medieval history, the Renaissance becomes less and less impressive because it really is just a continuation of the developments made in the Medieval era. The Renaissance was the culmination of development many centuries in the making - and was not a sudden \"rebirth\" as is commonly toted.\nThe story about how the Muslims were the only ones who \"saved\" the Greco-Roman texts and rescued Western intellectualism is, for the most part, overplayed. Again, it is conveniently forgotten that it was the Byzantines who originally provided the Muslims with the texts - most notably, when Caliph al-Mamun, in exchange for a ceasefire, requested that the Byzantine Emperor Theophilos provide copies of the greatest Ancient Greek and Roman/Byzantine literary, philosophical, mathematical, and scientific texts. It was throughout the long centuries between the Fall of the West and the Sack of Constantinople that the Byzantines preserved over a million volumes of the works of Antiquity and otherwise at the Pandidakterion and Great Library of Constantinople until the latter was destroyed in 1204 during the events of the Fourth Crusade. Afterwards, due to the establishment of extensive Byzantine trade networks across the Mediterranean in Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages, the Italian maritime states (in many cases, Byzantine colonies which gained independence) gained control of many of these works. So, essentially, the Italians already had access to the works of antiquity, before the \"reintroduction\" of the Arabic versions in the mid 1200s by the Toledo School and others. The claim to fame of the Muslims is that it was their studies of these ancient works that revolutionized mathematics and scientific thought in Western Europe in the late Middle Ages, this may be why they get the credit for \"preserving the works of Antiquity\", but that doesn't negate the fact that the statement that \"they were the only ones who saved intellectualism from the clutches of the European Dark Ages\" is incorrect. \n\nOverall, the term \"Dark Ages\" generalizes and poorly reflects the events of the Middle Ages in Europe. It neglects the achievements of Byzantium, as well as those of the Western Europeans, and unfairly treats these people as if they were degenerates. Just by using the term \"Dark Ages\" to describe any extensive period of the Middle Ages in Europe, one is promoting ignorance of the era, which negates over a thousand years of development by some very intelligent and inspired people and promotes an archaic and biased viewpoint that has been recently superseded by more extensive, sophisticated, and open-minded scholarship. In the end, the \"Dark Ages\" weren't really that dark.",

No one ever at the time called it that, nor felt it was living in a \"dark age\" despite everyone knowing about the classical world to some degree you shithead. Same way that the inquisition went from the most fair justice you could get anywhere at the time to a genocidal institution. And the same way there are no records of \"Prima Nocta\" before the XVIII century despite being claimed that it was a medieval institution that existed everywhere.\n\nIf you think fake news is a new phenomenon then you don't know shit about history. They were a bunch of hypocrites who claimed to use the scientific method and have an standard for historiography but just made things up that then sticked for centuries because those lies coincided with the creation of mass politics. Thus \"the true\" became was most people agreed it happen instead of what really happened. The same shit you just did by saying \"most people...\", just that you don't have the convenient excuse of being an illiterate peasant, you are just a moron that never bothered to check what you heard.",

No one considered the middle ages as a dark age before the Jacobins started to call it that for political reasons. The advances made during the middle ages on all fields are impossible to list but somehow you are too illiterate to have heard of them.\n\nFarming, math, astrology and philosophy are the most important. But I guess you think that people in classical Rome and the middle ages used the same farming equipment, techniques and organization. Or that the church really persecuted those who investigated astronomy when in fact the Church paid for most studies made on the subject, including the entirety of Copernic's studies. Or that the houses, palaces and public works were built in the same way just because in both periods they we made of stone. Or that the political system rested over the same ideas and institutions just because on both times you had despots.\n\nI don't really know what you want me to do here, teach you what is common knowledge? hell no, is not that hard to buy a book about the radical transformations made on all fields during the middle ages, do it yourself.",

Assuming that because B follows A, that A must have caused B, is a [post-hoc fallacy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc).\n\nI do a rain dance and then it rains. Doesn\u2019t tell you anything about what caused the rain. Unless you allow superstition to impair your thinking. \n\nThe article is masturbatory validation of one\u2019s own belief system IMO. Material conditions matter a whole lot more for development than religion does.\n\n>\t1. The universe is good, and it is a good thing to know about it. If people believe that matter is evil, they won\u2019t be inclined to investigate it.\n\n>1.\tThe scientists of the 17th Century believed the material world to be good because God had made it good. Genesis 1 ends with the comment, \u201cGod saw all that he had made and it was very good\u201d (Gen. 1:31). Moreover, the essential goodness of matter is affirmed by the Incarnation.\n\nScience does not require somebody to think that the universe is good. Only that it is *useful* to know about it, which is not the same thing as a normative statement like \u201cgood\u201d. \n\n>2.\tThe universe is regular, orderly, and rational. If people believe that material behavior lacks order, they won\u2019t bother to study it.\n\n>\t2. The founders of modern science believed that the universe is regular, orderly, and rational because God is personal, rational, and faithful.\n\nThis guy is trying his hardest to stretch his own fictitious version of \u201cscientific assumptions\u201d until they can be shoehorned into his faith.

This type of argumentation goes a level deeper than what we typically do. This line of reasoning argues for a need of a fundamental presupposition and moral framework to by laid out before certain types of thinking about the world can arise. And it is really hard for us to know to these fundamental presuppositions because they are woven into our language and culture, they are the very lense through which we see, they are the way by which we judge the world as good or bad. I would say it is almost impossible for us to imagine how these fundamental ethics could be different and how differently we would see the world if they were.\n\nTom Holland's book Dominion is about this, very interesting stuff",

Most mathematics are based on ancient numeric traditions dating back thousands of years, with the most examples being from India, since India had incredibly solid record keeping. The assumption that maths just sprung up one day is the silliest thing I see people discuss. We've been doing math since long before we had ink.\n\nGreeks were doing complex maths before Mohammed was even a name.\n\n> yet they gave the world numerous inventions.\n\nThey also existed in a perpetual state of war and slavery. Also, they didn't actually give us that many inventions, we simply attribute a lot to them because it is exotic, subversive (and racist) to do so.\n\n> such as in stem cell research.\n\nAnd Mengele helped advance anatomy and epidemiology and surgery. Ends don't justify means.\n\n> most space travel breakthroughs came from atheist nazis\n\nFalse, but I know you probably really believe that. And regardless of this, I never claimed *only* Christians invent, I said that the extreme acceleration we've experienced in the last 400 years are a result of the reformation - something *unique* to the Christian values. It took hundreds of years for the so-called \"Islamic Golden Age\" to catch up with ancient Greece. It took all of human history until the Reformation to decide Slavery bad, mmkay!?\n\nAnd that Islam and China you like? Still have slaves to this day. My! What progress they've made!",

People talking like there are pedo popes or that it\u2019s more common to have pedophile priests make no sense because it isn\u2019t true. The only reason pedophiles were protected in the first place is to not break the seal of confession, which is a pretty important rule that goes for anything confessed to a priest. As for the actual priests that have been protected, yeah it sucks that it happened at all but in the last 2 years the pope has done what he needed to remove the possibility for more coverups and has given a lot of information to authorities about this stuff. This problem is also absolutely not specific to the Church nor is it more common in the Church than other institutions.\n\nhttps://www.childabuseroyalcommission.gov.au/final-report\nThe Salvos, the YMCA, the Scouts, schools, Jewish institutions, you name it.",

              "text": "That's a very post-Kantian or even Marxist-materialist view of the metaphysical. The assumption of a rejection of the metaphysical being the \"most intellectual\" without questioning *why* it is being rejected is fundamental to reaching the conclusion that following Christ is akin to a \"legal framework\" in place of existing frameworks. On first principle this conclusion is false:\n\nChristianity rose during the times of a very rigid secular legal system where both Moses' Law in Judea and the Roman Law of the time were observed and followed. Christianity did not replace either system nor did it enhance them or detract from them. The assumption, then, that Christianity is a legal framework is false.\n\nAt no point has the fundamental basis of Christianity ever been a legal framework. Paul and Jude explain that only Jews had to observe and follow the Halakha. Ignorance of the distinction of the *law for the Jews* and the lack of ordained laws for the rest of the world is something most non-believers struggle with grasping, and is easily forgiven. This dichotomy is both the blessing of Christ's sacrifice for *all* creation, but also the burden that the tribe of Israel carry for being chosen to bring Christ into the world - as well as the ones with the guilt they carry for killing the Lamb of God.  The ones favored by God will always face the greatest persecution, the most harm, the most violence - from Abel to modernity, that is the price of being chosen by God in a fallen world. \n\nThus it is impossible for Christianity to have \"essentially acted as a Form of law\".\n\nChristianity has been *abused* and *twisted* by *corrupt false prophets* to act as something it isn't, and during this time we experienced many of Europe's darkest times - until the good news of Christ's sacrifice finally reached all those who would listen - at this time the Catholic church fell politically, Kingdoms of greed and godlessness were torn down and great minds who thought of creation and liberty rose up to lead the Enlightenment.\n\nSecondly, you assume law was a result of religious framework of morality and ethics, rather than the endurance of any given religion being a result of the belief set being used to establish the legitimacy of power. For hundreds of years in Egypt, the faith of the Israelites remained despite there being no structure which required it. The Law of the Levites / Moses' Law was only compiled *after* their exodus from Egypt, and much of it governed acts and behaviors which had been inserted into the Israelite population during their time working (presumably as slaves) under many kings leading up to Akhenaten. That said, the price of the freedom from slavery was submission to God, the price of being chosen to be the lineage which would bring Christ to the world was strict purity. At least, presumably. All this to say, we have a very clear outline of what Judaism is *because* of the strict laws and traditions. We do *not* know the faith of the captive Israelites *because* these strict laws and traditions did not exist.\n\nCuriously, the strongly religious, strongly organized Ancient Egyptian civilization managed to leave behind no discernible evidence of law - even in the form of religious lessons.\n\nUr Nammu and Hammurabi's codes of law both predate the laws of Moses. Both also greatly deviate from what appear to be the, at the very least, the inheritance of royalty and social order instruction of Egypt - as authority in both reigns was derived from legitimacy rather than divine right, unlike Egypt. While the epic of Gilgamesh appears to establish a divine story, it also does not appear to be a tool to legitimize an otherwise illegitimate authority.\n\nThirdly, and I just briefly touched on this - there are two forms of authority; legitimate and illegitimate. Illegitimate power and authority leads to tyranny and rebellion, legitimate power and authority lead to prosperity and peace - at least generally. The use of something akin to what I assume we both understand to be \" religion\"  to create legitimacy for authority is nothing new, we see it all the time in modern times with cults. This is also how Christianity differs from most metaphysical theological or spiritual philosophies. Christianity rejects the submission to worldly powers and instead liberates the individual from the burden of submission to others. There can be no priestly class, as there is no layer between God and Man, for the intercessor, Jesus, IS God. I cannot think of any pre-Christian or even post-Christian significant metaphysical-spiritual/theological movement which delegitimizes *all* spiritual authority other than God.\n\nSo then I will summarize:\n\nChristianity does not establish laws (for gentiles), our most ancient codes of law make no mention of religious beliefs or religious traditions and finally Christianity stands apart from most spiritual movements in that it does not grant authority to anyone other than God.\n\nI took way too long to write this.",

Invent Language/Writing\n2. Agriculture.\n\nBeen a few years since i read it but i'm pretty sure these were the 2 most important things,  if you introduced these to \"Modern Man\" 199K years ago,  we'd have achieved in 2K-5K years what it took us 200K years to achieve the way we did it.",

There's tons of examples, here are a couple:\n\n First flight was achieved in 1903 with an odd wood contraption. Within 70 years we went from never flying to landing on the moon.\n\nDuring World War 1 many armies still relied on horses for hauling/transportation. By like 1945, horses were only used for special purposes. In less than 40 years we nearly completely phased out horses, after using them for thousands of years.\n\nSmokeless powder was invented in 1894, after almost a thousand years of black powder. By pretty much 1917 black powder was almost completely phased out worldwide. Then just 51 years after smokeless powder was invented, we tested the first atomic bomb.\n\nEffective communication, specialization, fast transportation, and war all were factors that helped technology explode during this time. I know this doesn't accurately reflect all of history, I just wanted to show how far we've come within even the last 140 years.",

We went from cars and planes being invented a little over 100 years ago, to jet fighters by WW2, to space rockets in the 1950s and 60s, to putting a robot on Mars in 1997. Just in the past few years, SpaceX - a private company - has made the cost of spaceflight far cheaper than before. \n\nThis happened because there were certain achievements that needed to be unlocked in many different areas in order to level up as a species.\n\nThe primary ones that were needed were CAPITALISM - which led directly to the industrial revolution and globalization of trade - and DEMOCRACY - which ensured peace and forced economic energies to be spent on bettering humanity instead of fighting constant wars.\n\nThe story of humanity of the past 100 years was the destruction of monarchies and outdated systems of government (WW1), the rise of fascism and communism to challenge capitalist democracy, with fascism defeated in WW2 and communism defeated primarily through the Cold War over the next 40 years. Although the shitbag Chinese Communist Party still needs to be defeated, it is only still around as a threat because it LARPed as capitalist for the past 30 years.",
