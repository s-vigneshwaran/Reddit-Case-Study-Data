One of those\n\n Uncle is big mono brow fat guy with hair... Fucking hair everywhere, except on his head.\n\nSo confused.\n\nIs your uncle rich?\n\nNo he is broke, works nixers, usually teaching English jobs.\n\nWtf.\n\nMeet uncle. Really nice guy. I mean, really nice and the genuine meaning of nice. Jimmy Stewart nice. He is so nice that you walk away thinking, dam, I need to be as nice as that guy, because that entire interaction was so nice.\n\nPresume personality. Don't get it but ok. Whatever.\n\n\nYears later, mates mother is tipsy after a few and is talking about it. I am trusted family friend, basically spare child. Super trust.\n\nShe tells us that one time she asked her about it because she couldn't hide it anymore and just had to know.\n\nTurns out she loved that he was kind, loved his personality, but really when she first saw him it was all primal and she just thought he was sex on a stick. Loved his big belly. His hairy shoulders and baldy head. \"More skin to rub\".\n\nIt's been over 15 years. My world has still never recovered from this revaluation. The only thing I am sure of is that there is no league, there are no rules, there is no too good for someone, none of that exists after this. It's a fucking free for all.",

We took our seats and the priest was up front talking about \"salvation\" and \"holiness\" or whatever. Same thing as last week.\n\nBut then, he said something that really caught me off guard. He spoke of a man who goes by the name of \"Jesus.\"\n\n\"Jesus.\"\n\n\"Je-SUS.\"\n\nNo way. I could not believe what I was hearing. Endorphins were rushing to my brain and my body began to shiver as I let out a quiet moan. If you didn't catch on by now, the word \"Jesus\" has \"SUS\" in it, which is a reference to the popular video game \"Among Us.\"\n\n\"WHEN THE IMPOSTER IS SUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\nI screamed louder than I ever have in my life. My words echoed throughout the room for five seconds before fading into complete silence.\n\nEveryone was staring at me as I had a huge grin on my face, perfectly replicating the face from the \"when the imposter is sus\" meme (Google it if you don't know what it is.)\n\nThey all had this look on their faces as if I had just slaughtered 7,924 Afghanian children.\n\n\"Why do you all have that look on your faces? Did someone do a Fortnite dance?\"\n\nAnd there was still complete silence. I actually had to make sure I wasn't wearing my noise cancelling headphones that I always wear while playing Among Us. I could not believe that not one person in the room was dying of laughter!!\n\n\"Young man, please be quiet\" said the priest.",

Hell, I even saw parallels between the Dolores becoming \"alive\" and wanting to destroy the park and uproot the systemic issues related to it and Seong slowly learning how the game works and ultimately deciding to go back to fuck it over. The cop dude in SquidGame ran parallel to Bernard's story in WW. \n\nWhen I finished the show my first thought was \"why the fuck am I not seeing people say this is just westworld with a different skin?\" Westworld just did it better because of the whole converging timelines thing making it more interesting.",

Him stopping the game by 'being scared' only completely convinced me he was in charge. \n\nI went in thinking I'd be watching the next Akira, Zero Theorem, or Sixth Sense at least; but no it's just a predictable drama with some slightly interesting settings.

Not throwing something in someone\u2019s face isn\u2019t pretending.  For example, if a person someone loves is dead, I don\u2019t need to go out of my way to bring it up.  If someone made a mistake, or had a flaw that they are insecure about, I don\u2019t need to go out of my way to point it out to them.\n\nIf I overheard her talking to her friend about how hot the guy on squid game was, I wouldn\u2019t care.  What I do care about is respect.\n\nYour bravado is not a substitute for self respect, of which you clearly have very little.  Projecting some idea that you\u2019re so super secure that you put up with outrageous acts of disrespect really makes you come off as deeply insecure, tbh.\n\nWhat purpose does her telling you about how hot some other guy is serve?  So you know what kind of bull to pick out for her later?",
