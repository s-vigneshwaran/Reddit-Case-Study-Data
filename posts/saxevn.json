Whether or not you trust the was it was developed is up to you, I'm not here to change your mind about that.

That\u2019s how you eradicate diseases. As you can imagine, it\u2019s very hard to manage that, but vaccination helps reduce the number of susceptible people, so that, in time, would help you get close to those conditions.",

There is no such thing as a 100% effective vaccine, if you hammer someone immunized with any vaccine repeatedly with the contagion that the vaccine is meant to prevent, there will be a breakthrough infection, and if you are infected, you can spread the disease\n\nSecond, the covid vaccine doesnt reduce your risk of being infected? Id like to know where you got that particular bit of bullshit, [because people with functional brains have done actual studies and found that the mRNA vaccine is upwards of 90% effective](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison) at preventing illness in initial studies, and nearly 100% effective at preventing hospitalization. Know how effective the smallpox vaccine is? Bout 95%\n\nThird, the vaccine only lessens the symptoms? Even if that were all it did, [and its not](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02183-8/fulltext), how exactly is \"getting mildly sick instead of going into multi-system organ failure\" a bad thing? Is people not dying a bad thing now?\n\nAnd finally dipshit, for the love of fucking god, take a statistics class before you start spouting the \"but most people who catch it are vaccinated!\" bullshit. If you have a thousand people on an island and ten of them are unvaccinated and the other 9900 are vaccinated, if 10% of the vaccinated get sick and 100% of the unvaccinated are sick, then shockingly, there are going to be more vaccinated people who are sick, ***because there are more vaccinated people to begin with you colossal fucking dumbass****.* This is like claiming that 90% of murders in Italy are committed by Italians, no fucking shit they are, theyre in fucking italy\n\nCourse, your claim is flat-out wrong anyways (and what a surprise that is):[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/01212022/images/COVID-19-NET-65Booster-2022-01-21.png](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/01212022/images/COVID-19-NET-65Booster-2022-01-21.png)\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html)\n\nAllow me to summarize:\n\n>CDC\u2019s Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) shows that rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in December 2021 were markedly higher in unvaccinated adults compared to fully vaccinated adults who have received additional or booster doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Among adults ages 50\u201364 years, the COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate in December among unvaccinated persons was 44 times higher than among those who were fully vaccinated and received an additional or booster dose. Among adults ages 65 years and older, compared to persons who were fully vaccinated and received an additional or booster dose, rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations were 49 times higher among unvaccinated adults.\r  \n\r\n\nYou know, for an 'ineffective' vaccine, it sure seems to be doing something, since the smaller population is still being hospitalized at a rate 44-49 times higher than the vaccinated population\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR - get your head out of your ass you moronic fucking plague-rat\n\nP.S - loled at \"vaccinated individuals are actually 30% MORE likely to test positive for coronavirus\" being presented A) without a source, and B) without the realization that the people too stupid to get vaccinated arent very likely to get tested",

It made an entire generation of parents much more hesitant to trust modern medicine without holding a speck of credibility itself. This lack of trust has been preyed upon by unethical salesmen for years, convincing those whose fears were started by the study of various other bits of false medical advice, and alternative medicine continues trying to rope suckers in. \n\nThe doctor i mentioned who falsified that original study? The guy only spoke out against the MMR vaccine because he was paid to and because that way he could sell his own measles vaccine separately. After losing his medical license, he had to make a living somehow, and nowadays he is a speaker at modern anti-vaccination rallies and has a book (ironically called Callous Disregard) \n\nHe\u2019s not the first, last, or only snake oil salesman, but he\u2019s the origin of anti-vaccination as a common concept and is still deeply tied to the community. \n\nThe only arguments i have seen against COVID-19 vaccination fall into 4 groups: \n\n1. the same sort made against other vaccination types by the same people fooled by that first study, \n\n2. being developed too fast (a factor that isn\u2019t a problem because literally all the governments in the world threw money at the problem to make it go away quicker, which is more of a testament to how underfunded medicine is), \n\n3. the medical risks taking the vaccine has, all of which are negligible to the point of non-existence compared risks of the disease itself, \n\nAnd 4. Politically charged and connected to some other conspiracy theory. \n\n1 is obvious, 2 is connected to anti-government conspiracies, 3 is just 1 but hiding it better, and 4 is also obviously conspiracy related. All of which are connected to the conspiracy started by that damned paper. It\u2019s also not the first, but it is up there in the list of the most destructive.",

So if little Timmy somehow had smth bad happen after a certain vaccine (whether really linked or not, depending on the reason etc) many will be skeptical. I for one held out on the Covid shot till last summer, simply bc it was new medication, to choose the right one after the braver (or more at risk / needing it faster) took it. But not many people can do a risk assessment and go with it for better or worse, without demanding / complaining later. Especially in this day and age of entitlement.",

Because you think yourself morally superior, that your individual desires outweigh the needs of the group. \n\nThe group that you reject by putting yourself ahead of, has subsequently rejected you for your choices and now you don't like it and see it as hateful, when any reasonable person would see it as an entirely expected outcome.\nBut if you only see the value in you own point of view, you will only ever see yourself as the victim of others, rather than the consequences of your own actions.

The vaccine isn't 'just for you' the vaccine is for everyone around you. It doesn't have 100% effectiveness, but no other vaccines do and nor do they claim to. They reduce the symptoms and shorten your time of infection, sometimes to the point that you don't realise you had the disease. So far I've seen no genuine scientific or medically sound reasoning coming from antivaxxers for reasons not to get the vaccine, it's always just weird conspiracy theories.",

Most of the people I know don\u2019t want it because of the facts that are out there that tell a different story to what the tv media are saying about covid deaths. For instance there was a freedom of information request in the UK into the number of deaths FROM covid and NOT WITH covid. It turns out that only around 17k died from it and NOT the 170k they were reporting on the news. The average age was mid 80s so I dont blame them really. But if we weren\u2019t lied to from the start about it all and had lock downs, then people who needed treatment for other illnesses would have been priority like my partner needed.

Lots of coincidences happen. Scientific investigation shows that there is not an adnormal amount of any kind of deaths in the vaccinated. What you have here is a logical fallacy as others have pointed out - one thing that precedes another doesn't equal the cause necessarily. Seemingly healthy people drop dead from heart attacks and other things. \n\nIt might feel easier to blame something, to have an explanation that makes sense to you, because its hard to accept that people can just suddenly die, and therefore it could happen to ourselves.\n\nNot saying that vaccine is risk free, and I quite agree with your sentiment that the risks of not getting vaccinated outweighs any risk attached. That seems to go over most antivaxxers heads.",

She\u2019s not vaccinated, but she\u2019s fine. You know why? Because it\u2019s not as bad as they say. Every single person I know that\u2019s gotten it said it was like a bad cold and they didn\u2019t have energy and had heavy lungs for a couple days. Period it\u2019s not nearly as bad as they\u2019re saying. And fuck google, fuck the cdc, and fuck you. Fuck the internet, believe what you can see.

Then they translate this to mean 18% and 5% of all infection.  \n\nJust makes no sense to argue with someone, based on these two facts, cannot determine how things actually work in real life, and has minimal reading comprehension. They just are not going to understand anything you write properly.",

Not just the active molecule written on the box, but every single component of it. Of course they don't know because nobody does. \n\n2) Do your research beforehand and remember one or two components with a name that sounds mad scientist-y. In my case it's povidone k90 and something called type A carboxymethylamidon. Then just ask \"there's povidone k90 in the cold medicine you've been taking for 20 years. Do you know what it does? Do you know what's its long term effects?\" \n\nOf course they don't because they're no biologist. At that point they will either a) shut up or b) say no but that's just cold medicine and you can just ask them why they would trust big pharma with a cold medicine but not with a vaccine.",

But they will get it at a much lower rate, which gives the virus time to die before it can pass itself to a new host. And, if a person is not exposed to it at all, they would never get the virus - which is why unvaccinated people are a threat, because they're more likely to expose a vaccinated person to the virus.",

First he was all \"covid is bullshit, look I haven't respected any measures the past year (mask, social distancing etc...) and I haven't catched it. That just proves it doesn't exist\". \n\nThen he caught it, and when told about how there's basically no chance he'd get covid for the next couple of months, he said \"no no, my dad told me I have 100% immunity for 6 months, so fuck yeah now I can do whatever I want\". His dad, who he only talks to like once a year on the phone and he's described as the biggest idiot/asshole on earth for as long as I remember, suddenly became the voice of reason. \n\nNow that it's been 6 months since he caught it, he still won't get the jab because \"I got covid and it wasn't that bad\" \n\nAll the while looking particularly smug whenever he says \"I don't give a fuck about covid bro\" like he's some sort of spartan hero.",

And again, my original comment was talking about healthy kids. \n\nNo evidence correct but let's look at our country and see that every hospital is given extra money for each person diagnosed with covid. More money for putting them on a ventilator and lastly money for covid deaths. In this society it is easy to see that what we are doing. And the death rate in Texas for going into the hospital is over 70%, remdesivir isn't working and that's all we are using.\n\nLet's be honest, omicron is a cold. I have gotten covid, the deadly delta varient and it was the flu. This is very highly contagious, but the average death age is higher than life expectancy. Kids are not dying. And the numbers for kids are not drastic enough to be forcing a vaccine on them. Flu deaths are worse than that.",

Billionaires like Bill Gates released the virus to the public so people would get vaxed and would die because we dont want to overpopulate AND they want to get richer because they invested in pharma to get the vaccine out earlier. OR Billionaires released the virus on purpose with a working vaccine that they released a year after the start of the pandemic to see who would follow anything they say. So everyone who took the vaccine is someone who would follow billionaires and everyone else will die of the virus. So what makes more sense? Billionaires killing 80% of their customers in developed countrys that would probably destroy the economy and make their money kinda useless OR billionaires kill only 20% of the people to only have followers and still have enough customers?\"\n\nHe then tried to tell me more about the first thing i wrote and i simply told him that i dont want to talk with him about this topic anymore because everything he says is simply \"fake news\" because i sat there and googled everything he told me and showed him how to fact check and he still sat in his bubble. \n\nLike i said at the beginning, these people will never turn on what they THINK is real. It's like [this video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMJXvsCLu6s).

It is reasonable to expect that there could still be unknown sideffects. It's just that the situation appears to outweigh the potential for them at moment. For all we know, more babies conceived from parents after vaccination could actually have autism or predisposition to sids, but there haven't been enough births or enough time since birth to determine all of this. More realistically, it could affect reproduction of children of vaccinated parents. That would take like 20 years to find out. Most of the antivaxers are idiots yes, but you can't just handwave away every concern. Is it likely, no, but you can't say \"it's been a year, nothing bad has happened yet\".",

Although to be fair I haven't looked into the bureaucracy stuff in detail, which is why I wrote afaik. What is true, and really the only valid argument there is, is that there hasn't been a long-term trial for this specific vaccine. Although mRNA tech itself is far from new either, and has been in many other trials for other usages before.\n\nAlso, the sample size of vaccinated people by now is far too big to still be talking about all those potential side effects as an excuse, which is kind of what this meme is about. (And my comment previously was about it being medically incredibly unlikely for something like a vaccine to have side effects that will just randomly pop up 10 years later, when there hadn't been a sign of it soon after getting it. Sure, nothing is impossible, but at that point it's really just splitting hairs and probably a wrong evaluation of priorities and probability)",

You're the reason why things are in such a shit state.

I don\u2019t get the flu jab every year because I\u2019m not typically offered it on the NHS. And yet people do die of the flu, in their thousands, why am I not equally selfish for not getting that jab? I could potentially have saved a life I never knew about by having that vaccination couldn\u2019t I? I didn\u2019t have it because *I* didn\u2019t need it, the same reason the majority of the population don\u2019t have it. So why is it immediately \u201cidiotic\u201d (nice) to question whether a group of people almost entirely unaffected by covid, and one who incidentally is unable to consent to that medical intervention themselves, really needs to have the covid vaccination?",

The virus can kill people, but they can also survive and have to deal with long covid, which is obviously nothing any healthy person would want to deal with.\n\nAll of those are reasons why people under the age of 30 should still get vaccinated.

Really it's impossible to use real world data to know what case numbers would have been like with or without the vaccine because we don't have a control group to compare against. This is why we turn to science where these studies have been done in isolated groups and they have given us answers that it helps.\n\nAlso Israel has over a 95% vaccinated rate so doesn't that mean the numbers you are giving shows a trend that an unvaxxed person is 5x more likely to catch covid and kind of proves your point is wrong? \n\nAlso you've kind of changed the subject. You have said vaccines shouldn't be necessary if masks and distancing \"works\" and I'm wondering what you mean by that and who told you that?",

Those who blindly follow what the media shovels down their throat tend not to read what other people have to say.\n\nThe protection rate is changing cause there are variants, true. One of the few things you said that actually is. \n\nThere is zero evidence to suggest that the new variants are popping up due to unvaccinated people. It\u2019s just as likely that a new variant pops up in someone who has been vaccinated. \n\nAs I discussed above, being properly vaccinated does very little to curb the rate of infection. At the very most it is cutting it in half(which is well within CDC\u2019s margin of error(for example, technically being unvaccinated was only 2/3rd\u2019s as likely to catch it than someone who was double jabbed, using the same study as my comment from earlier of course). \n\nYou are less likely to have symptoms yes, so are more likely to go about your day and pass it on. Are therefore MORE likely to spread it. \n\nBut yes, you\u2019re less likely to die. \n\nThe pandemic will continue all over the world until a variant pops up that is more similar to the flu in that it\u2019s manageable and easy to live with. Omicron shows signs of it being that variant. Due to such a widespread global economy in today\u2019s world, there\u2019s simply no way to halt it in an individual country, and the vaccine is never going to reach the poorer companies because many people like yourself, just don\u2019t understand that if you\u2019re going to provide mass vaccination, you actually need to provide it to the masses rather than just those in first world countries.\n\nThere are also several independent studies suggesting that getting omicron(which is mostly harmless) provides better immunity that a booster jab(which you\u2019d expect, given the booster is just a third dose of the vaccine which was created primarily for the alpha variant). If a new variant was then to mutate from the existing omicron as opposed to mutating from an older variant, having had omicron would again provide better immunity than the booster jab.",

Given that people are getting the virus at the same rate whether they\u2019re vaccinated or not, there\u2019s once again zero evidence that anti vax/anti mask are those responsible for there not being heard immunity. \n\nThe vast vast majority of people I\u2019ve met who didn\u2019t want the vaccine are significantly safer in day to day life than those who\u2019ve had it. Due to the blatant misinformation provided by mainstream media all over the world, there are large populations of vaxxed who simply don\u2019t get that it\u2019s not a cure all, and are now attempting to go about there daily lives as if it\u2019s not there in the first place. I\u2019m the only unvaxxed in my family. Im one of 3 in my friend group. Im the only one that took a test before Christmas and we were the only 3 that took one before new year. From people I\u2019ve spoken to who are vax/non-vax, this appears to be common place. You obviously have the idiots that are taking the piss, and unfortunately the silent majority is often drowned out by the actions of a loud few. But trying to act like there aren\u2019t the same idiotic types who\u2019ve received the vaccine is comical. I\u2019ve also seen zero evidence to suggest that people who are properly vaxxed are more likely to self isolate. For one, they don\u2019t have too(at least where I live). If you\u2019re double vaxxed(don\u2019t even need the booster) you don\u2019t have to self isolate just because you came in contact with someone who has it. Even though the data out of Manitoba suggests they\u2019re no less likely to catch it. The masks that the majority of people are wearing also do very little to halt the virus anyway. And that\u2019s across both vaxxed and unvaxxed. \n\nYou\u2019ve been shouting but it\u2019s simply not going to happen. Big pharma isn\u2019t interested in halting the virus, they\u2019re interested in their bottom line. There also simply aren\u2019t enough plants producing the vaccine to send to 3rd world countries and for 1st world countries to be receiving boosters. You claim you\u2019re not an idiot but you don\u2019t seem to respect the economical or physical limitations of widespread vaccination. \n\nOmicron is killing at a lower rate the flu does in some seasons. And at a significantly lower rate than obesity does every single year. A line has to be drawn somewhere and personally, omicron is more than safe enough for the vast vast majority to be getting on with their lives. \n\nYou\u2019re being blinded by your hatred for that silent minority that you can\u2019t even bring yourself to look at what\u2019s in front of you. There\u2019s is nothing to suggest heard immunity would have been achieved if everyone was vaxxed. And there\u2019s literally tons of evidence that says heard immunity wouldn\u2019t crush other variants anyway. Actually do some research on the matter before trying to come at me with your \u2018facts\u2019, cause honestly mate, you\u2019re full of shit.",

Then that protein is released into your body, where, just like any other vaccine, your white blood cells notice it's forgein, eat it, and put up wanted posters.\n\nThe only thing that stays in your body are the antibodies, which are created the same way as any other.",

You could have said \"they work by fucking your butt with a dildo\" and you still would have been just as incorrect.\n\nThe shot contains RNA of the spike protein genome which has been sequenced and isolated by people much smarter than us. Also in the shot there exist lipid compounds and other things to help the RNA material survive in the body's harsh environment. The body responds to this foreign substance via the immune response. Antibodies are produced to fight against similar pathogens.\n\nA simple analogy: bouncers in a bar only know that anybody who is wearing their black shirts is allowed in the bar. Over and over again, people who are not wearing their black shirts are getting into the bar and causing problems. A person in a red shirt has caused problems once before, so now the bouncers know to be on the lookout for people in red shirts in the bar. Now, consider an instance where somebody finds a piece of paper somewhere that says \"YO WASSUP, I GOT A BLUE SHIRT ON AND I'M GOING TO ARRIVE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE AND CAUSE PROBLEMS.\" Now, instead of letting the blue shirt fellow walk in and cause trouble, the bouncers are on the lookout for people in blue shirts.\n\nIt's a prophylactic measure to ensure that a person does not get super sick from the virus because their body has been exposed to the genetic material of a certain part of the virus that makes them sick.",

Particularly when one of the outcomes is death, there have been fewer covid deaths in vaccinated people than unvaccinated at least per capita, not overall as the % of unvaccinated drops.\n\nNow, please answer my question; How do you know the risks from the vaccine are worse than the disease?",

Maybe that\u2019ll change in a year or two, but until then I think healthy skepticism is warranted given the nature of our society.

So maybe the DNA altering unprecedented mRNA treatment for the gain-of-function-lab altered virus isn\u2019t the most chill thing to inject into your body based off the suggestion from the same socio political entity that allowed if not outright encouraged the opioid epidemic.

It also mutates far less, and therefore is easier to develop a vaccine with a higher efficacy rate. Also makes it possible to reach herd immunity at a much lower threshold.\n\nJust keep spreading your lies and stupidity I guess.

Goalposts are still there: A subreddit designed to mock a group isn\u2019t a valid source of evidence and thus there is still none to underpin generalising the entirety of anti-vaxxers by this one seemingly small opinion.

You\u2019re still unable to provide any valid evidence of these claims.\n\nIf they are then it should be easy to provide any evidence whatsoever then. Refusing to provide any actual evidence but showing me to your favourite facebook page where there are unsourced images which say vaccines are bad for you isn\u2019t going to cut it, so why should it be different when you do the same?\n\nThese rules are not arbitrary, again this is how science works. But maybe pay attention to the criticism and stop with this tangent of \u201cI can\u2019t believe this guy doesn\u2019t just instantly buy these unsourced claims which I can only back up with a social media group!\u201d.\n\nI had never heard it, you provided clearly flawed evidence, I explained these flaws and you got upset.

Calling that shit out. You're the one that called me a plague rat and wishing death upon me. I touched your nerve but you won't admit that because you're not an honest person. \n\nLol you're the one offended because I'm not vaccinated you dumb ass racist. Again with \"you people\". You say I sound like a beta while you're scared of getting sick. You say I sound like a beta but you're the one that had to say something because I'm not vaccinated. See the irony? I think you're too stupid to see it honestly. That's why I'm pointing it out. On top of that you're wishing me death. You're fucked in the head, you're selfish, and you're a coward, projecting your shit personality on me. You suck as a human being. I'm not wishing you death, I even said I would help your miserable ass. You think that makes you look like a decent human being? Nope. You're a coward piece of shit that's hiding behind a vaccine. You keep missing the part that I haven't gotten sick once this entire time unlike your dumbass but you're still wishing me death. Weird huh? It's like just because I didn't do what you did you wish me death. I'm repeating that to show you how much of a piece of shit you are. I'm not going to get sick. I take care of myself. I haven't gotten sick in over a decade, go fuck yourself for wishing me ill you piece of shit. Not everyone is unhealthy like you are. Not everyone has comorbidities like you do. Not everyone is a coward like you are.\n\nAnd why did you bring up women? You're trying to make me look a certain way because you're not an honest person. I'm not a white male Trump supporter you stupid fuck! Bet you missed that too due to stupidity. Again you're a piece of shit that wishes death upon people. Fuck you and your parents that failed to raise you.\n\nI bet you use derogatory terms when you describe races as well. You sound like you're a racist piece of shit. You're saying plague rat but I'm sure you use other colorful words when you describe people of color. How does it make you feel that an Arab speaks your language better than you do in your own country? I love it when white people tell me what to do with my life, call me names like plague rat, and tell me I'm doing things wrong because I don't want to do the things they want. It's the same exact scenario here. Who the fuck are you? You're nothing but a racist to me. What's next? You're going to tell me to get out of your country too?",

So that would indicate a different risk reward for each person individually.  My argument stands though if me or no one I know got myocarditis from covid, why would we boost that risk by getting an unnecessary 5 shots? \n\nThe problem at the root are the lies. For me. I cannot watch health officials come out and say:\n\n1. The vaccine is \u201csafe\u201d. As a blanket. And mandate everyone take it even when thousands of people have their doctors advise against it. Then it comes out well actually it has some minimal side effects including death. \n\n2. You\u2019re fully dosed at 2 vaccines. Never mind. 3, now it\u2019s actually 4. Then actually never mind it\u2019s 5. \n\n3. The vaccine prevents spread except in breakthrough cases. False. Again. \n\n4. Don\u2019t wear a mask. Never mind wear one. Now wear two. \n\nI could go one for days with the lies of our \u201cexperts.\u201d Fauci even admitted to lying about saying not to wear a mask. At what point do you realize it is not unheard of or understandable to stop believing these people. \n\nThis isn\u2019t football. You can choose to pick a side, but that\u2019s foolish. At some point you might actually have a differing opinion, and that\u2019s ok. I\u2019d be interested to know what the max number of boosters you\u2019d take until enough was enough. Especially when you see us plague rats walking around just fine. Common sense has to kick in at some point man.",
