I have to say it really kind of inflamed me to read that women spit them out.  Like reading sunflower seeds and we just spit them out it\u2019s that easy.  like we just sit down and give a little grunting out the baby shoots. It is so difficult to be pregnant and it takes over your whole life and you just try to take care of yourself and the life inside you as best you can. And nothing can prepare you for childbirth. I actually thought I was gonna die. And of course it does happen all over the world all the time.  You\u2019ve been in this day and age there are still so many places that are under service and it can happen easily. A woman is truly taking her life and her hands in many places in the world and off and she has no say in it. She has no say in whether or not she has 10 or 20 kids. Children she is dependent upon for her husband to feed because there\u2019s no birth control I\u2019m talking about remote places. I know you\u2019re talking about North America but the thing is there\u2019s always been such an inequality. And I get that nowadays the young women are really obnoxious. I\u2019m 61. And I see it. The world has gone weird. But it will correct itself it always does. The natural stage of women is to want to be married and have kids and give them a good home and a safe upbringing. And I know there are plenty of good men out there that want the same thing too. I think the big problem is social media. And the Internet and that men have too many choices and women have too many choices. I think that will like I say correct itself because people get tired of it after a while. It\u2019s shallow and meaningless and people want to make a real connection and form real relationships that are lasting.",

But of course ask somebody who is a friend and will straight shoot it with you. And be kind and thoughtful about it as well.",

Seems like a lot of times when men get married their expectations change and women get stuck with the lion share of the work and believe me women are very resentful about that because really they just want a partner. They want someone to share the life and share the workload to not just the discussions about where their life is going in that sort of thing. I would never get married again personally. I am done being someone\u2019s personal maid. And that\u2019s not to say that cement or not tidy and clean some men are very good at that. And I think women can be disgustingly messy. The thing is what I\u2019m saying is everybody trying to lump everybody into an umbrella like men are all like this and women are all like that. And the truth is we\u2019re all just human beings and we\u2019re so different. And I think you just have to be upfront with someone when you want to go into relationship and tell them what you need and what you want and vice versa. And cross your fingers and hope for the best. That\u2019s the best person can do. It sounds probably I hope not too awful to you but I just have some friends with benefits.",

I just do my own thing and have my friends and family and they have theirs. And sometimes we include each other and sometimes we don\u2019t.

So it\u2019s the woman who asked the question we should bash, for this particular clip. I\u2019m any other context, from my little knowledge of her, she can be bashed for her feminist ideals.",
