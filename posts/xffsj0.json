Uses crowdsoured info to mark and let you autoskip in-video ads, like&subscribe reminders, stuff like that. It's pretty nice, and even keeps track of how much time you've saved by skipping. I've skipped the better part of a **DAY** of junk in the few months since I installed it.\n\nMight not be perfect if you watch small channels or videos *right* after they're uploaded though (a user has to mark the segments after all).",

I haven't seen an ad on YouTube or twitch in over a year. \n\nAlso has built in VPN/VPN over DNS/run in sandbox mode etc. Def a solid browser....and one of my favorite features built in is 2 meters that show how much processing power (as well as how many cores) and how many GB of your RAM is currently being used by the browser and all tabs you have open. \n\nBut the best part is it will let you dedicate exactly what percentage of your processor and how many GB of RAM you'd like for Opera GX to be able to use at any given time. So if you only have like let's say 8GB of RAM and you have many tabs open and it's using 6+ GB of RAM while it's idle and you're not doing anything....you can set the Gauge to only be able to use a maximum of 3GB of your RAM for Opera GX and then set the processor usage Gauge to only be able to use a max of something like 35% of your processor. \n\nIt also has countless other amazing features, but those are just a few off the top of my head without it being in front of me. (Oh and you can also use the built in reddit launcher/discord/whatsapp etc so you can see notifications from all your most used programs right on the left hand sidebar instead of downloading and running separate programs in the background)",

It would be a difficult project to keep going because Google makes the open source code for the browser and everyone else bases their changes to their own flavour of the browser from that source code. It would mean every time Google made a new version someone would have to add back in support for manifest v2, which would be a lot of work.",

After that Google slaps their proprietary components on to Chromium and calls it Chrome.  \nThe problem is the upcoming manifest v3. It will make the best and fastest (ad-)blocker Ublock Origin a shadow of it's former self and that is probably intended, because Google is one or maybe the biggest online advertiser.  \nThe other browser providers could change the chromium base and remove/modify manifest v3, but the problem is, that this kind of thing is not a trivial thing. It requires lots of resources. And any upcoming changes to Chromium connected with manifest v3 will require more changes to make the code of the fork work.\nAs you might have realized, it's way too much work for the browser providers and there is no use for them to integrate (good) adblocking.  \nThe only way is to change to Firefox. Even on Android Firefox is better than Chrome. You just need 3 clicks to install Ublock Origin.",

This post makes me think that they're just trying to squeeze the most out of the smaller part of their audience that still doesn't pay for YT Premium/use an adblocker, instead of just  making Youtube a paid-only service.\n\nThey're in such a dominating position when it comes to videos on demand, especially user-supplied content, and most of their audience still expects to not pay for it. If they shifted to just paid service, the competition would swoop in like lighting.\n\nBut if they just keep nudging those who for some reason can't abandon Youtube, but also can't find adblocker agreeable, while also doing work behind the scenes to make adblockers less and less viable, they might just keep their dominating position while people adopt the directly paid service more and more.\n\nAnd then they can just keep pushing the price up, as long as people don't leave. And as Youtube itself has shown times and times again, people will take a lot of shit in stride as long as it's gradually introduced, all thanks to their dominating position. Having most content creators keeps viewers, and vice versa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point it might be worthwhile considering ways to help out the Youtube's direct competition, rather than budging. Obviously I myself am still watching it because that's where few content creators that I really appreciate are. My point is more along the lines of spreading the idea that shifting to another platform is okay, rather than that paying Youtube is okay. The more people talk about it, the more content creators know people are willing to move to another platform, making them more willing to do so, too. Obviously, that change can only be gradual, but it's better to gradually change the situation for the best than change yourself to accept the worst",

It just makes it illegal to circumvent any copy protection, no technical details necessary. It's not so hard to imagine lawmakers proposing a similarly hand-wavy (and equally hard to enforce) law forbidding people from circumventing any revenue-generation measures.\n\nYou're entirely correct that all of this would largely be unenforceable theatre (again, look at DMCA), I'm just saying that you shouldn't underestimate the stupidity of lawmakers, nor their susceptibility to lobbying.",

We have been in a battle since I got , my first phone through insurance, then I took my time sending the broke phone back. They were cutting off , y phone 2-3 times per week. I am not exaggerating. They failed to cut it back on one evening , I had an accident with some jumper cables which resulted in me catching a car on fire, so calling T-Mobile;e back was not the first thing in my mind. My boss tried to call me the next day and disconnected. I lost the FAA buildings that I cleaned at the airport. I am on my 3rd insurance phone and they just added the cost of the damn phone to my account/ I always pay my bill in full on time every month. \n\nI use a OnePlus 8T w 5g, I love the phone up until they did the last software update. \n\nNow everything has changed on the phone. Things were turned on that I had turned off. Like safe search, I can not find my porn when that is on.\n-\nI also have malware somewhere or something on this phone. \nI will admit that I am real knowledgeable about things such as this but I have a good mind, I pay attention to everything. \n\nI am supposed to have protection from bullshit calls and ads I thought with my insurance plan that I pay for every month. [Too much money] I have noticed that it seems to come and go\n\nMcAfee. I have never had ads coming up in the middle of the screen , at the top and bottom. I can not read anything. \n\nLike the last week, no more BS calls. Today they are ringing off the hook.\n\nI don't care for A 12 and would rather go back to Android 11. \n\nIt's messed up and I am ready to leave T-Mobile but I need to put my latest phone in service, but if I transfer everything , will the problem not be transferred ALSO? \n\nIs There a book for people like me. So I can learn this stuff. Anymore you go in the net to research something and it's all bullshit leading you to try and buy something, when I am looking for knowledge.",

For instance, YouTube at one point was using a whole lot of non-standard CSS and JS features that were fast on Blink/V8 but not so much on Gecko/SpiderMonkey or EdgeHTML/Chakra. I'm unsure as to whether this has changed or not, but I do recall that somebody measured page load times on YouTube in different browsers and discovered that they were noticeably faster in Chrome.",

YouTube I mean.\nOn minds is already the case (although is users who advertise their posts not the usual ads, so it isn't as annoying) you can turn them off for a 7 a month (or 5/month) but there was a good twist to it. You can earn the points and use those, to gain premium subscription meaning you don't have to pay real money, if you active as a user you'll get those points for free). ATM this option is restricted, allegedly due to technical difficulties, but I'm sure it will resume in a year or two... \nI can see why such models are necessary, but at least minds managed to somewhat balance it between paying customers and customers who add value to their platform, getting it free if they chose so.\nAltho all went downhil once changes were made so user can actually turn those points into cash (somewhat. Turn them I to crypto token than exchange that on marketplace for cash)",

I happily watched Youtube without adblockers before video ads were a thing. Banner ad on the right, another one on the video itself and that was it.  \nPre-video ads (back when you got only one that was always skippable at 5s) were annoying, but I could live with them.  \nMidroll ads is where I drew the line. They actively work against me when I'm just trying to watch content. From interrupting videos mid-sentence to making scrubbing through a video a pain in the ass: this was clearly an ads above usability choice.  \nNowadays I'm happy to use an adblocker whenever I see posts like this.   \n\n\"But what about the content creators?\"  \nThey know just as well as I do that their revenue does not come from ads, it comes from sponsors and donations(/memberships).

We expect the recommendation engine to work, videos to stream at any bandwidth level with no buffering. \n    \nAll of the above costs a lot of money. Hiring the right developers, devops, IT, admin all costs money.  Running the servers cost a fuck load of money. Bandwidth, fuck load of money. And we haven't even gotten into the entire physical infrastructure that has to work in order for YouTube to operate. Servers, chillers, more ac, security systems, etc etc. \n    \nI pay for YouTube Premium. Zero ads, 13, bucks a month for a fucking INFINITE amount of knowledge or whatever bullshit I want. I spend more on one beer in San Diego than I do for YouTube. \n    \nTL;DR: Stop being a cheap ass and pay for Premium.",

Especially if you also like, comment, and subscribe, which will cause the algorithm to further promote the video you\u2019ve done that for. Is it, then, really more moral not to watch YouTube than to use an ad blocker? Not from a utilitarian perspective.\n\nYou could argue that watching with ad block hurts YouTube itself more than not watching at all would, since it uses their resources to deliver content to you, but YouTube themselves don\u2019t seem to think this way. YouTube knows whether or not you are blocking ads. That\u2019s how they know how much to pay creators. They could easily decide not to allow anyone blocking ads to view any videos, but they do not do that. This tells me that YouTube sees it as more beneficial to have people on their platform blocking ads than for those people not to be on the platform at all.\n\nBecause of this, it seems to me that watching YouTube with an ad blocker benefits all parties involved more than simply not viewing YouTube does. Watching it with ads is of course more beneficial to YouTube and creators than either of the other options, but my argument is simply that not watching YouTube at all is actually worse for all involved than just using an ad blocker. And since I don\u2019t consider not watching YouTube immoral, I don\u2019t see why I should consider using an ad blocker immoral, either.\n\nI hope that made sense.

They easily could do this. Therefore they choose not to do this because they see some benefit to themselves for people to watch with ads blocked rather than not watch at all. How does that not make any sense? \n\nSome potential benefits they may see are:\n1.\tMore training data for the algorithm\n2.\tMore general viewership which makes them more appealing to investors, and also to new content creators looking for a platform\n3.\tSome ad revenue when you view on other devices or share videos with people not using as block\n4.\tMore favorable public image. The people who would complain the most about ads just block them.\n\nSo again, watching YouTube with ad blocks apparently had a positive impact on YouTube compared to not watching YouTube at all. Because I would not say it is immoral not to watch YouTube at all, I don\u2019t see why I should say it is immoral to watch YouTube with ads blocked when there is a benefit for all involved compared to not watching.",

Let\u2019s say there is some genre of videos that notoriously have users using Adblock or these users just have extremely low engagement with ads.  The value of those ad spaces are very low.  But it costs just as much to deliver the video as a high demand video, and just as much space to store the video as a much higher view rate video.  So to make it worth hosting, it may require more ads.\n\nI fully expect that in the next few years YouTube will start to limit uploads.  Videos below a certain view count will either be deleted after a certain time or you can pay to keep them hosted.  I have seen tutorials of people showing how you can get free home security monitoring by uploading live streams to YouTube instead of paying monthly hosting fees that most security systems offer.  Nobody is going to watch your 24/7 footage of the side of your house, and YouTube isn\u2019t going to put up with hosting that for free forever.",

They just also happen to sell ad slots to some of those same advertisers.\n\nIts the same situation with Amazon's Marketplace. Amazon Web Services (cloud storage, website hosting, etc) subsidizes their entire \".com\" online store. The cut they take, ads they sell, fees they charge, and prime subscription help keep the marketplace a little more buoyant, but the only reason they could force so much downward pressure on the prices is because the real money maker, AWS, subsidizes the losses.",

Many content providers (like YouTube / Reddit / Twitch / Spotify / Pandora / Facebook / IMDB / Hulu) now stream/serve ads from the same servers as the content (meaning if you attempt to block the ads using a PiHole you will also block the content). \n\nIt\u2019s still worthwhile to use a pihole on your local network.

And I have no doubt that the clever developers of uBlock origin will find alternatives to block the same content. The concern appears to be that once ad *makers* become aware of the removal of this method, they'll start making many more ads that are suddenly much more difficult to block. Honestly though I feel like it's probably going to be fine.\n\nFor now. For me this is less a serious issue in its own right, and more a sign of a *serious* problem in the web-browser space. Which is that Chromium has a near monopoly. We're talking >90% of the windows desktop browser market, and >99% of the android mobile market. **That** is a serious problem, practically demanding that google abuse their power, and a minor change to the extension API is just a taste of what they *could* do.\n\nIf you're not using firefox now, switch. Just not (mostly) because of this change.",

I wouldn't expect anything in return. The problem is that too many people treat Youtube as a business nowadays. The days where people actually made videos for fun is long gone. You make this seem like I'm personally attacking you, the creator by not watching ads. I don't have a problem with creators. I have a problem with the middle man. When you skip a 5 second ad, Youtube still gets their share from the ad, but the creators don't. In a lot of ways Youtube likes to exploit people, viewers and content creators alike. And these are the people you're defending. Yes they are a business. But when they make billions off of other people, and still expect more and more, you have to draw the line somewhere. And judging by the number of upvotes, there are about 4500 other people who agree with me on this. And if you say \"don't watch youtube then\", then tell me. What should I use? Youtube has an absolute monopoly in video sharing.",

Google is 5-10 years ahead of its nearest competitor on that front. Imagine a new player trying to replicate that.  \nYou need a powerful ad tech platform so that you are delivering the right ad to the right audience at the right time so that your advertisers, which are you true clients, get the most out of their buck. Again, Google is 5-10 years ahead of its nearest competitor on that front. Again, imagine a new player trying to replicate that.  \nYou need an vision AI platform to look at and classify the content that is being uploaded at scale, for curating purposes, for copyright purposes and for brand safety purposes (advertisers do not want their ads on content with nudity, curse words, racism, etc..) Again no one else can come close to do it at the scale Google is doing. And replicating that is ridiculously expensive.  \nYou need a global ads sales force, a global billing and collections sales force, a global copyright and policy staff, etc...  \nAdd on top of all of that the globally redundant storage, encoding and decoding capacity plus bandwidth costs and you begin to realize just how dauting the idea of making a direct Youtube competitor really is.  \n\n\nYoutube as a viable business was possible only because it piggybacked on the Google AdSense infrastructure, which allowed it to scale.\r  \n\r  \nNot even Amazon, Microsoft or Facebook have tried to replicate Youtube because they know how difficult/expensive it is.\r  \n\r  \nThe only true competitor Youtube currently has is TikTok, which does not allow long form videos nor videos to be easily searched.",

There's 20 year of uploads covering every possible topic and knowledge hundreds or thousands of times over. Google is probably not going to kill of ad blocking on YT completely, just make it more difficult for the average Joe(like, Google prevents me from automatically getting 1080p video, have to set it for every view separately), and then they'll probably plan on irritating specific users with ads so that those users purchase the premium service.",

They are being held hostage by YT and ad companies because it's either enter a deal where you are dependant on other companies - or try your own luck and miss out on revenue.\n\nIt is seen as a symbiotic relationship when in fact it is parasitic.\n\nCreators need a solution that values their work and pays them directly and that doesn't even allow a stranglehold like this in the first place.\n\nOnce the money issue is solved, everything else should be a walk in the park. Which means, a serious competitor needs to have a solid payment plan for their content creators.\n\nAnd if you think about it, watching ads and/or implementing ads is a waste of time from the perspective of the creator and consumer, because people want to watch specific content which is delayed and creators want to do their actual content instead of filming some dumb shit they don't identify with.",

But if they ever lose momentum, unless they get more and more money poured into them until stabilising, they might try and keep themselves afloat at user's expense and sacrifice the quality of service, entering a death spiral. And one thing that they will never be able to do is instantly change people's minds, so even if they instead decide to implement positive, but revenue-cutting changes, that might very well end up being too late.

For context TikTok pays you a [fraction](https://youtu.be/jAZapFzpP64) of the money that YouTube does and as such, as soon as you become big enough on TikTok, you try to make vlogs and long form content on YouTube.

You wouldn't necessarily want to go toe-to-toe with YT out of the gate. That's just a dumb idea unless you have an absolutely absurd amount of capital (and even then it would take several years to get anything like that functional).\n\nHowever, a far less capable platform that can function well enough AND solves a major problem that YT hasn't solved and cannot quickly pivot to solve would put you at a decent advantage to win some of the market share. \n\nI don't think it's a tech race either. YT being owned by Google means it will have access to and be supported by the most cutting edge technology. Even if you developed a proprietary technology it would only be a short matter of time before YT emulates it or buys a company that can do what your tech does but better - barring some incomprehensible advance in technology that can be copywritten and trademarked.\n\nReally, I think it'll come down to an improvement on the business model that improves user experience and revenue for content creators. Of course, the ability to advertise is a part of that and being able to buy reliable ad space is a must. That being said, if you can win over the content creators and their audiences with a more comfortable platform then the ad agencies will more than likely follow. Something as simple as fusing a patreon or twitch type of model with YT could be all the difference. I think several of those options have already been explored and it's only a matter of time before someone gets it right and starts putting strain on YT as a competitor. \n\nI don't think YT will be going away anytime soon. Even if you have this holy grail of a business model you still have to address all of the typical risks of starting and growing a business - which is not trivial. Hell, it may have already happened but for reasons not related to the business model the company failed. But, even if you don't fail outright you still have several years of winning the market and growing the platform. Then you'll have to accept that you probably won't be getting all or even most of the market share that YT owns. You'd want to find a way to also bring people from other streaming services as well and to say that is a competitive space is an understatement. \n\nIn the end, I see YT more as a competitor with Netflix with a niche in indie \"home-based\" VOD content. Gaming is a clear niche type of content in YT but that's entrenched in copyright and licensing stuff I wouldn't want to put a start up through. I'd focus more on the things like cooking content or unboxing content. Sure, it's a smaller portion of the whole pie but it'd be a lot easier to build an MVP for that given there's much less legal red tape and much more opportunity for product placement and brand promotion.\n\nIn fact, I think we saw YT making a proactive defense against this with its YT Kids product. But, this was no small feat for YT to pull off and they can't do it with everything. In reality, I don't think it'll be a 1:1 competitor that takes out YT. Instead, I think it'll be death by a thousand paper cuts. More niche VOD platforms for more niche content that crops up through several companies that slowly chip away at YT's market share until they are left with only the niches they can protect and keep in their domain. But, again, we're talking many years before that happens in any significant way.",

This is more of a \"direct\" competitor to the YouTube Premium play.\n\nWhich, by the way, I can't understand why more people don't use. Whenever anyone complains about ads, I'm like, how do you think this stuff gets paid for? You either have to deal with ads like on TV, or subscribe like Netflix or HBO.\n\nWhat is the magical no-cost solution you have in mind, exactly?? The world owes you a free video streaming platform with no ads?\n\n\"No, it's the **amount** of ads.\" Yes, they're going to show you as many ads as you'll tolerate before you stop using the platform. They are a business. They will put more ads until they get right up to that line where you'll keep watching and not leave. So stop whinging about it. It's always going to approach \"barely tolerable\" because that is the magic money spot. The better the content and the more you want to watch stuff on YouTube, the less likely you'll be to leave if there are more ads, so the more time you'll spend watching ads.\n\nIf you don't like it, subscribe to Premium. If you're spending a few hours a day on YouTube, $10/month or whatever is WELL worth skipping all those ads, and you don't even have to feel guilty about skipping in-video sponsorships either bc the creators your watch are getting a big chunk of that subscription fee.\n\nPeople who hate ads begged YouTube to make Premium and they did. If your say you hate ads but you haven't subscribed or just left the platform altogether, ask yourself: How much do I hate ads *really*?",

So basically everyone wants the most ad views achievable except users, and there's two ways to increase: increase the number of people watching, and show more ads.\n\nThese two things are in tension. So they'll continue to show more ads until it starts slowing down growth in watchtime. The most important thing is to continue to grow audience, but if people contribute to tune in\u2026\n\nThe other thing to keep in mind is that more ads can *grow* watchtime on the platform. Creators make more money, they invest more time in YouTube as opposed to TikTok, and make vids with higher production values that you want to watch more. The content is just better and there's more of it.\n\nThe way to leap frog all of this nonsense as a user is simple: Subscribe to Premium. That's what I do, and it's awesome. Great user experience, removes incentive for creators and YouTube to continue growing the ads model.",

A few years ago, it was viable to plan a career as a Youtube creator, nowadays the ad revenue is a lot less than it was, so getting to the point of making a living from it is way more challenging.  \n\nStill, it helps me fix bits on my car when I get confused, so theres that :D",

Netflix, HBOMax, Amazon Prime, HULU are much easier problems to tackle and work on an incredible smaller scale than Youtube. As of 2020, 500 hours of video are uploaded, encoded, classified and stored into Youtube every minute. No other cloud services comes close to dealing with video at that scale. The difference is in orders of magnitude. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>What\u2019s missing is investors \n\nMany tried. Many kept throwing money on their video start-up until hey realized that it was a bottomless pit that would never turn a profit and gave up. \n\n> Google is too big anyhow, they need someone to yank their pants down and teach them a lesson and I believe it will happen.\n\nOn their own game? Not gonna happen. If someone brings Youtube down, it will be the ones who comes up with a completely new and disruptive way of consuming content. Something akin of what Youtube was to cable TV.",

For example, if people want to find recommendations for places to visit in a holiday destination, they will search it on tik tok & watch every video tagged with that location. \n\nLots of people seem to prefer this kind of content delivery over traditional google results, so the platform is being used like a search engine already despite it's clunkyness & never being intended to be used as one. I doubt this will be lost on the company running it, so they will likely be pushing the platform's development in this area.",

You know very well it's not losing users in the sense that they just stop using social media altogether. It's losing users to other social media platforms. \n\nI have no disagreement that it would take time. Yes, the bigger things are, the more entrenched they are. All I'm saying is that all of these platforms are subject to the same forces. Adding qualifiers like \"it wasn't beaten at its own game\" or \"the industry was smaller then so it doesn't count\" is beside the point. In another decade or two (or however long you mean by \"many *many* years\"), are we going to be making the same retrospective observations about Facebook compared to whatever the biggest platform is at that point?

Therefore the issue here is not a binary between either replicating it as it is now or nothing.\n\nMy second point, as far as this reply chain goes, is that I disagree with the other commenter that Youtube can only be beaten by \"changing the game\" - although that's extremely vague and undefined anyway. They said Blockbuster/Netflix is not a working analogy because Blockbuster wasn't beaten at its own game, so I gave an example of a platform that was more clearly beaten at its own game. Whether social media is simpler than video hosting is tangential to that point.\n\nI still don't think you and I disagree all that much on any particular thing, especially since you agree a Youtube replacement can happen.

There are no (viable) competitors to YouTube if they cannot immediately match/duplicate YouTube's capabilities without the perceived flaws. While other social medias can fall from grace, YouTube is protected from that because YouTube has an economic moat, which is again their platform design. If this was not true, then e.g. Dailymotion would be as popular as YouTube.\n\n>They said Blockbuster/Netflix is not a working analogy because Blockbuster wasn't beaten at its own game, so I gave an example of a platform that was more clearly beaten at its own game. Whether social media is simpler than video hosting is tangential to that point.\n\nIt (MySpace) was beaten at its own game because there was no *barrier to entry*. Simplicity is not tangential to that point, it is directly related to why it was able to be beaten at its own game. The duplication was almost effortless. You can't ignore the means if you want to state the end and have the end make sense in regard to another hypothetical end.\n\nTo put it simply: YouTube is a near-monopoly. MySpace or whatever other social media platform that doesn't need highly complex infrastructure has never been a monopoly or anywhere close to it.",

Will a competitor have to exactly match Youtube's capabilities in order for people to move away from Youtube?\n\nYes, because if YouTube starts charging $1,000 per view or whatever other demand-killing \"unacceptable\" value, then there must be a technical reason for doing so. Maybe bandwidth has become that outrageously expensive. YouTube is trying to maximise market share and growth at the same time. They are not completely irrational or else you could hypothesise that YouTube is ran by a team of toddlers and the hypothetical's point becomes lost. If YouTube is charging that $1,000, then competitors will charge even more to stay afloat.\n\nWhat I've said just now is true because YouTube has the power to undercut other competitors with ease; it will not be vice versa. Funnily enough, undercutting (predatory pricing) is another trademark of monopolies. \n\n>For me the main issue is where the users want to be. Consumer behavior, if you will. The capabilities are a part of that, sure. But they're not nearly the whole picture. The topic of this very thread is evidence of that.\n\nNo. This thread is not evidence of a market shift regarding demand (which would be relevant evidence), it's just complaints. I've seen this with YouTube going back more than a decade. People will always complain, yet come back as if nothing changed... because in this case, there are no alternatives and creating an alternative is highly difficult, unlike for social media. \n\n>There are other replies to cambeiu's long comment that also think duplicating Youtube is not a prerequisite\n\nI am going to presume that they are not software engineers. Duplicating/improving YouTube's streaming capabilities while beating their expenses is mandatory in order to merely start pushing YouTube out. Then you need to entice the content creators. For a relevant example, see Amazon's Twitch and Microsoft's Mixer (RIP). Microsoft has the power to duplicate an easier-than-YouTube video streaming platform, but they failed to bring over the viewers anyway.",

Even if the executives are making irrational decisions, then there are still high barriers to entry for any new competitors. It's part of the core reason why monopolies are seen as an issue and a market failure.\n\n>But then what did you mean by \"match/duplicate YouTube's capabilities without the perceived flaws\"? How could anything be without the perceived flaws if they are all inherently by necessity?\n\nI mean match their capabilities on a technological level. Servers, bandwidth, etc. That sort of thing. Match their technology without what people find an issue e.g. high advertisements. At least make it less flawed, not necessarily flawless altogether. That's what you need to start (and only start) dragging people away from YouTube.\n\n>And you also said \"nobody is saying that YouTube will be around until the end of time.\" So then, how do you see it ever failing?\n\nAlphabet Inc. might be broken up by the state, the barriers to entry become less extreme in the sense of technology becoming cheap enough, nationalisation of the YouTube platform itself (seriously doubt it), YouTube gets banned in other countries which leads to new local competitors, etc.\n\nAll are very unlikely. Your question would be better rephrased as \"how do you see a near-monopoly or a real monopoly ever failing\"? Historically, it has been the government coming in and doing their thing by force.\n\n>Do you agree with cambeiu that Youtube can be beaten by a company that \"changes the game\" more easily than one that doesn't? \n\nThis is more subjective than objective, but I would say yes. \n\nI also don't see how one can change the game when it comes to a video streaming platform, which has a very basic goal even if it's hard to create. There's a few ideas like decentralisation via blockchain, but they're just brainless business hype as of now.\n\n>If so, why does the capabilities requirement not apply as much to them?\n\nBecause of the barriers to entry of the current game. If you change the game, then I'm going to presume that the ones who changed the game have a first-mover advantage and that the barriers of entry to the old game (the one YouTube was playing) are moot.",

So if I want to watch ad free YouTube I have to use the website, if I try using the YouTube app I\u2019ll still get back to back ads. The website might still try to load the ads but as soon as I click refresh the ads get blocked. It\u2019s a small work around but I\u2019ve gotten used to it haha.  \nIt was a one time payment of like $3 I think. [Adblock](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adblock/id691121579) if you\u2019re curious but it hasn\u2019t been updated in a while so idk how well it holds up to other apps now a days. Gets the job done for me though so I\u2019m happy with it",

(It is an alternate version of youtube with no ads and free youtube music if ya want)\n\nThen in My files, open the downloaded file. It'll download vanced manager. Then open the app and through there download youtube vanced.\n\n This is the method I use, I like it because you can watch youtube videos in a small window, have no ads, watch youtube red videos for free (not movies) and it has a feature to skip sponsorships\n\nThis might be a bit difficult, so on android you can also download brave browser and watch youtube through the browser, but it is inconvenient and kinda sucks, but atleast no ads.\n\nOn PC\n\nIf you use google chrome (only on pc)\n\nUse an extension, this blocks ads. There are many, but [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) one works for me (im sure others can share others that they prefer)\n\nI havent used apple devices, so I wouldn't know much about that (sorry)\n\nHope I helped and my instructions made sense",

Which operates on the same principles as HLS. They may not be currently inserting ads via segments directly into the stream, but they could be. They're definitely identifying them as ads however.\n\nuBlock appears to work by identifying the part of the site which tells you it's running ads, here's how Easylist's blocking list sort of works:\nhttps://github.com/easylist/easylist/wiki/Youtube-Issues\n\nSo - if they stopped telling the player it's running an Ad, they could stop ad blockers i guess?\n\nDon't have time to look into DASH and how to read what's being sent via Youtube. However my initial concern stands - how much adBlock are they willing to accept before breaking it entirely?",

I know, it's crazy, right?  That there might be ways of accessing the service without seeing any of these ads AT ALL?!  And that the more numerous and obnoxious the ads become, the more likely people might be to seek out those methods?!  And some of those methods might be open-source, so that even if YouTube sues and has a project's repository taken down, anyone can just copy the code and post it somewhere else!  There might even be -- and I'm just spitballing, here -- browser extensions for laptops and desktops, or even third-party client apps for mobile devices, totally dedicated to reducing the number of ads you see and generally being better than the official experience.\n\nBut yeah, I know... that's just crazy talk.",

Adding the SponsorBlock extension to either browser will additionally allow you to skip sponsor segments, intros, recaps, or a variety of other sections of videos.  \n\nI would recommend some extensions for Chrome, but as of the end of the year Chrome and basically all other Chromium-based browsers will be getting an update that will severely hamstring privacy-oriented and ad-blocking extensions.  (Brave is Chromium-based, but its ad-blocker supposedly won't be affected by the update to Manifest v3 since it's built-in rather than an extension.)\n\nOn mobile devices, ditto the Brave browser, or Firefox with the uBlock Origin add-on.  Android phones used to have Vanced until earlier this year.  (If you can get your hands on the apk it still works, but no guarantees on how long.)  And then there's SmartTube Next, which is basically an open-source Vanced for Android TV devices.\n\nI'm sure I'm missing some options, but most devices are covered by either Firefox with the right extensions or Brave.  I can't think of a way to watch ad-free YouTube on either a Roku or Apple TV without paying for YouTube Premium, but for everything else it's easy.",

Yes, there are other forms of entertainment that can compete with Youtube. But Youtube is much more than just entertainment. It is the 2nd largest search engine in the world, second only to Google itself. People go to Youtube for education, news, product reviews, travel planning, cooking instructions, DIY tutorials, healthcare advice and so much more. And that huge amount of traffic for those purposes is not moving to Twitch, TikTok, or Spotfy, no matter how many ads Youtube puts up.",

When it was just some unobtrusive banner ads I didn\u2019t bother, but I\u2019m not going to sit through a ten second ad to watch a thirty second YouTube clip, and I\u2019m not going to use a site that has ads pop up that cover the content that I\u2019m reading and then scroll down the screen with me, or spill over on the side panel so I have to scroll the text around to read it.\n\nYes there\u2019s a trade off between free content and advertising, but they took it too far and became too intrusive. It\u2019s similar to how a lot of DRM for various media, books, games, music etc is a far inferior product to a pirated version. I pay for my games, but I don\u2019t even buy games at all that require me to jump through hoops and install secondary launchers, open new accounts for single player content and connect to a server that if it\u2019s down I can\u2019t play offline etc etc. don\u2019t make the paid version more difficult and annoying than the free alternative or you can\u2019t blame people for taking it. Hell, there are some games that people buy to support developers and then find they end up having to download an offline hacked version to even play because of server issues.",

It's made me spend more time looking for videos than watching them. It doesn't even feel like YouTube anymore I only open it cuz it's on my Chromecast. But then I get awful ads over and over again. I don't mind ads but I don't wanna see a Pixel ad every. Fucking. Video. I miss Vessel but need to find a new platform. It's just hard with the niches I love.

                              "text": "I think what you\u2019ve said here is pretty fair and balanced, I mostly agree. The one thing I will say though is that PrivacyTests is meant to look at a vanilla browser: the average user does not go out of their way to install extensions or harden their Firefox browser in config files. The privacy tests show the best privacy settings out of the box that will immediately benefit the average user who won\u2019t do any extension installation or hardening.\n\nThe other thing is that Braves anonymous collection of data is opt-in. You can use shields without opting in. There have been third party independent parties to verify this fact, and, it is open source if you don\u2019t believe the audits.\n\nFor the non average user, I agree that hardening and extensions is the preferred option. Beyond the extensions, Firefox has some defaults that aren\u2019t the best for privacy. Hardening is a must:\n\nhttps://ffprofile.com/\n\nhttps://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/\n\nhttps://chrisx.xyz/blog/yet-another-firefox-hardening-guide/\n\nI don\u2019t think the Librewolf negatives are that bad. I use it as a daily driver. \n\nBut hardened Firefox with extensions is undeniably one of the best choices, for sure. \n\nThe quantum rendering engine is great and gives webkit a run for its money. Vertical tabs are also much more productive than just groups. But how about vertical grouped tabs?! https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/\n\nOne thing that Chromium still has the edge on in my opinion is dev tools. Even compared to Firefox Developer. Sure, Firefox Developer has a much better DOM viewer but man. Ever try to step through the debugger? It\u2019s way worse. Even the Network tools have less than Chromium.\n\nFor developers, definitely roll with Brave without opting into the voluntary anonymous data collection after MV3 comes out. Unless you only need network requests; then just roll with Charles Proxy or Postman at the system level in my opinion.",

They know that going paid-only will actually make everyone leave so they have to stay free to use. You could say that adding more ads will make more people use adblockers, and is counter productive, but I would assume they did don't make this kind of decisions without making sure it's better for them first.",

For example, they could just send raw video chunks to the player, except some chunks, despite coming from the same IP and otherwise looking identical to the rest, are actually ads instead of the content you requested.\n\nNow, sure,\n\n* They wouldn't be able to make ads unskippable with this scheme (unless they made *the whole video* unskippable), and keeping track of who watched how much reliably would be more annoying too\n\n* Even this isn't entirely insurmountable, e.g. addons like SponsorBlock already use user-submitted labels to identify which parts of the video are sponsored ads and the like, a similar scheme could be used to identify \"legitimate chunks\" for any given vid. They could even automate detection, e.g. by getting a hash of each chunk users were served as-is, no labels or anything, and any chunks that only appear for *some* users but not others must be ads (though YouTube could similarly fight back by e.g. always serving specific ads with specific videos, minimally changing regular video chunks so their hash is different even though the contents look identical to the naked eye, etc)\n\nAll in all, they could make things way harder to block than they are now. Of course, in the most extreme of cases, you aren't going to stop someone capturing the video (even if it means aiming a camera at their screen) and re-sharing it without ads. Just like preventing pirating or cheating in an offline game, it's a fundamentally impossible problem to solve for good... but that doesn't mean you can't *temporarily* solve it.",

No one should run their business in loss just so you can enjoy your entertainment for free. \n\nAnd it's not all about YouTube. \n\nHalf of YouTube premium money goes to creators you watch, so that there is incentive for people to keep making content for you.

As a bonus you can share a youtube link to the app in the normal youtube app, browser or ReVanced and have it download the video or audio for you.\n\nBest part is if you for some reason were to install and setup all this stuff at once it would take you 15 minutes and very little space off your phone, consume little to nothing of your battery and get all of the main youtube premium features for absolute free!\n\nOnly real thing none of these can offer is watching premium only videos, though i don't think there is anything worth paying for to watch that there still in 2022.",

Gave access to a bunch of friends as well, it's a great trade to offer anyone sharing a streaming service with you.",

So there is no down side, it's all just more money right\"?\n\n\"Well, our user base has been cut by about a third and is in free fall. We are making way more money per person but about half as much money overall. And that trend is continuing and soon we will have to stop doing this. Only when we do stop, we'll have a fraction of our former viewers and the company will never fully recover. This has been pointed out as a down-side by some people. But, and listen to me here. Our bonuses aren't based on any of that. Per user income goes up and you and I get rich! And we might need a new job in a few years. But we'll get hired somewhere else right away after we point out how we increased user monetization\".",

Like you'd host your videos on your own server, host some indexing files, and a decentralized video platform would scrape your server for your video content. YouTube's big issue is that hundreds of hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute and that's very expensive to host. Also, if they really wanted to make ads work, they'd show you three minutes worth of ads per 30 minutes of your cumulative watch time. That would line up with TV and be tolerable. Also, if they want to sell more YouTube Premium subscriptions, they need to give it more features than just the removal of the shitty ads they put there in the first place. It also feels like locking video downloads behind premium is a crappy move they do as well. Also, if anyone could decentralize YouTube, it's Google. You know, what with that little search engine business they have going on.",

WHICH MEANS IT'S NOT GUARANTEED do to how legal speak works. \n\nHe doesn't even properly explain the WHY the video with less views and was longer did better for revenue cause he doesn't bring up anything about YouTube Premium but just ad revenue so your point actually gets debunked there since the \"Building an EPIC Portable Gaming Rig at Home\" was a LIVESTREAM. They don't run ads during livestreams like say Twitch as even before I got my new ad blocker all the big livestreams on YouTube I watch didn't ever have those. \n\nYour also missing the part where that Linus Tech Tips LITERALLY in the livestream this clip is from has a sponsor/merch store at the bottom, the man gets sponsored by a fuck ton of computer part companies and computer adjacent companies and is one of the biggest damn channels with an ACTUAL proper YouTube representative his brand can directly speak with to get answers. \n\nYou actually have no damn idea what your talking about and don't know how to critically view a video.",

You have shown no evidence of someone saying they didn't receive anything.\n\nIdk what his merch and sponsorships have to do with anything. As I said previously those can be stronger revenue streams then yt ads, that doesn't mean they don't help out.\n\nAlso YouTube does do ads on Livestreams, just at the beginning though and not midrolls like he says.\n\nIf you want to use an ad blocker go ahead no one's stopping you, but don't act like it's the moral choice as if creators aren't missing out on your ad revenue too.",

The channel how money works covers this in one of their videos, how building a back catalog of videos for when you do make it bigger can actually be incredibly helpful.\n\nHow is the company taking advantage of people?  Without youtube, where would they post their videos?   Youtube gives content creators a chance to make a career, or simply have a fun hobby, youtube is not a charity, no one is owed a free youtube channel, so what is wrong with youtube making money to continue to provide this to creators?\n\nAll it comes down to it is that you're selfish, you couldn't care less about the people who are providing a service to you but you know that makes you sound like a piece of shit and don't like to think of yourself as a piece of shit so you make up a reason to justify using an add blocker.

Personally, I actually like seeing *some* advertising; as there are definitely things I\u2019ve enjoyed, products, services and events, that I would not have otherwise learned about without advertising. \n\nNow with that in said, there is a spectrum of how they advertise to us, that goes from \u201ccompletely tolerable\u201d to \u201cmildly intrusive\u201d, then to \u201chow dare they\u201d ending finally at \u201cyou slaphappy dong-slinging punk bitch motherfuckers should die in a fiery car crash\u201d.\n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at is, in a world where ads are necessary, it\u2019s the length and the repetition that matters. I\u2019ve seen Japanese commercials breaks with like five 2-second ads back to back, and been fine with it. It\u2019s almost impressive what an advertiser can fit into something you only see for a couple seconds. I don\u2019t care about the number of ads, I care about the length and repetition. \n\n10-20 seconds of ads before a program is probably tolerable, IF some care is taken into what happens next. I.e. don\u2019t break up the content of what I\u2019m watching with ads unless it\u2019s really long, like longer than 10-15 minutes. And then, when it\u2019s longer, the inserted ads should never be longer than a total of 5 -8 seconds. \n\nAlso, in the age of tracking us everywhere on the internet, the website should be designed to never show me repeat ads in the same session\u2026I definitely should never should see the same fucking ad back to back in the same ad break (looking at you Hulu). \n\nOh and set a timer since I last saw an ad and stick to it. If I rewind, or fast forward, or skip to another video even\u2026don\u2019t show me ads again or sooner; make the ad breaks dynamic, not set in stone.\n\nContent providers could choose advertising methods that would not make users/watchers despise them\u2026I contend that advertising doesn\u2019t have to be something we all loathe. \n\nHow we get from here to there is a different conversation altogether. And it\u2019s unfortunately unlikely. Till then, install those blockers where you can. \ud83d\ude15",

If a song isn't officially on YTM, but a random user has uploaded a video of it, you can add it to your playlist and it's seamless.

Don't need the video? The screen can be locked and you can use it as a podcast.\n\nWhy pay \u00a310 a month (or whatever it now is) for Spotify when for your money, YT Premium is superior.

You connect it to your router and it strips all ads out of everything you look at on every device on your network. You don't even have to think about it, it's just always happening in the background. And since it's a physical device that you have control over, you don't need to worry about an app updating and losing your ad block functionality.",

So if you get an unskippable ad and you don't like it, ask the YouTuber to switch back to skippable (or just use an adblocker tbh)! Also note that ads, if turned on, always have the potential of playing at the start and end of a video. \n\nIncidentally, I don't run unskippable ads on my vids because if I were the viewer, I wouldn't want to be locked into minutes of ads before I get to see actual content.",

It's infinitely better, just a little rectangle with some text about whatever (usually it's crypto related ads, but I never really read them) in the bottom right of the window pops in every so often (you can choose the frequency too). I'll go through some hoops to avoid ads that not only are intrusive, but are the sole thing preventing me from viewing content I want to watch and those pre-roll ads have never shown me anything I've liked, wanted, enjoyed.

I hate to point out the obvious, but they provide more content than any other platform, and they do not require anyone to pay a dime to keep this very complex and resource heavy service up and running. To hate on them for trying to generate revenue seems a bit selfish, but I do agree that the ads are very annoying. So my solution was to pay for the premium membership and viola, NO MORE ADS! My small contribution every month is keeping all the content under the sun streaming uninterrupted to any device I am using to browse, and I feel it is worth every penny. I have learned new skills that advanced my career and learned how to get better at my hobby and it would have been much more difficult had it not been for YouTube.\n\nTL:DR: If you don't want ads, consider paying for the hard work that keeps one of the most influential platforms running.\n\nEdit: Grammar",

Youtube loses money year by year and they aren't obligated to give you guys a free platform to watch videos.\n\nIf you pay for spotify, netflix, hbo, or any subscription service, then youtube red is a snap buy.

If you don\u2019t have a previous page, click a video on the side then go back a page. It doesn\u2019t work every single time, but you can always reload the page for a new set of ads or keep trying to click a video on the side and going back a page. (Only works for ads at start of video, not ones in the middle)\n\nAlso, sometimes if you go back a page then forward too quickly it\u2019ll play the same video instead of taking you to the home page when you\u2019re done with the video and try to go back a page. All you have to do is reload it and it\u2019ll be fixed.",

No ads, offline playback, locked screen playback, even the occasional YouTube original (by far not the reason why I am paying the subscription fee). \n\nI also despise ads, but I do understand why it has sense to have them in place. YouTube is a business - not a charity. \n\nWould it better if it was completely free with no ads and no interruptions - Yes. Does it make business sense - No. And lets face it, what other platforms out there have a comparable offering to YouTube? Vimeo?\n\nHappy to see this post down voted to hell. \n\nGood luck and have fun",

And I keep asking around for a YouTube alternative and so far no one knows anything. It\u2019s disheartening. YouTube has a monopoly on video streaming. \n\nOne the creators I watch even addressed this in a live stream. He doesn\u2019t want to go to another platform because they\u2019re too new and he\u2019s too well established on YouTube, but not big enough to get enough followers to switch. \n\nBut if no one switches over, these platforms will never take off and no one will ever be able to compete with YouTube. \n\nCreators should start uploading content to both YouTube and a new platform to beef them up and then start promoting switching over slowly.",

What they fail to realize is that a bunch of people will find alternatives, or just stop using the platform entirely. \n\nI\u2019ve always jokingly said that ads should be illegal to force upon anyone, because it\u2019s basically cyber-soliciting, right?

If I\u2019m watching something on my own property (TV, PC, etc.)  in my own home, and ads keep popping up, that\u2019s soliciting.

I tried using all the ad blockers, but having ads disabled on all my devices with just loging in it's too convenient. Besides they break too often. What YouTube is doing shows what happens when someone has a monopoly over something. There isn't really any competitor. Yes, there's Twitch but that's just for streaming and IMO YouTube's player is just better. They will play as many ads as possible and people will stay, because there simply isn't any place to go to for such entertainment.  We can bitch, we can moan and NOTHING is going to change. Look what happened with dislikes, there isn't a single soul besides big corp that likes the change and they still pushed it.",
