That seems self-explanatory and doesn\u2019t prove anything about abortion as the woman didn\u2019t make the choice to terminate the pregnancy. The crazy thing about overturning roe v wade is that it opens the door to overturn other rulings like Skinner v Oklahoma which made the forced sterilization of criminals, the disabled, and minority groups illegal because it was determined that we all have a RIGHT to bodily autonomy. There is also concern for access to birth control, same-sex marriage (which Alito already said is not protected by the constitution), among dozens of other rights that Americans have and could lose.\n\nAnti-choicers will twist the words of the Bible to justify criminalizing abortion all day, but until the same people start voting against the death penalty, supporting social programs that make it possible for women/ families to have children and be able to afford things like housing and childcare, etc. I really just can\u2019t be bothered to argue about what the Bible says\u2014not to mention that we live in a secular nation and laws that apply to 330 million people should not be, in any way, based on faith.\n\nThe last thing I\u2019m going to say on this is abortion rates in the US have been on the decline for decades despite abortions being readily accessible. If conservatives or Christians or whoever really wanted to continue to reduce the number of abortions, they would prioritize education, access to birth control (including vasectomies which is the most affective form of birth control besides abstinence), and supporting free or low-cost childcare and other benefits for families like livable wages, better public transportation, better and cheaper healthcare, etc.",

So if he sees a text for man that includes killing children/infants, than he\u2019s either allowing it to occur or indifferent that it\u2019s occurring at all. \n\nIt\u2019s all mental gymnastics to me. If the Bible is Gods words through man than either man has played the worst game of telephone in history, or, we nailed it and these are Gods words as he intended. Christianity would make you believe that these are Gods words as he intended. If these aren\u2019t Gods words, then they\u2019d lack all merit. If they are Gods words, then they should be acknowledged as such in their entirety. That includes the repetitive scripture around life as breath through nostrils, eye for an eye justice, proof of adultery through bitter water induced womb pain and fallen thigh, and the acknowledgement of pre born/child/infant death as justice and/or commonplace.\n\nEdit: I want to say I appreciate the civil discord. These are hot button topics and it\u2019s nice to have conversation that doesn\u2019t just receive responses like \u201cI will pray for you\u201d ha. No learning or intellectual growth occurs there. Oddly enough, I\u2019ve learned more about the Bible being pro-choice than I ever did as a young Christian. Go figure.",

I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. My frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.\"\n\nThere are many more verses that reference God knowing you before you existed or in the womb. Maybe others had a different experience to mine. The argument is essentially that the Christian God is all knowing and all powerful so theoretically if you abort an embryo you are aborting a life God had a purpose for and knew the future life of.\n\nIf you really want to break a Christian's brain ask them if all babies go to heaven automatically as the bible implies because God knows they are not capable of understanding so early, then isn't abortion doing them a favor? If they grew up they have a good chance to not be a Christian and be forced to go to hell instead by their all loving God who for some reason created humans with free will so we can choose him of our own volition at the risk of sending everyone else to hell. Guaranteed heaven is technically the safer option.",

Where is one shred of evidence not created by humans in their mind. Personal revelations are all bs shit created in one's mind. For an all powerful creator he sure has a hard time making his presence or will known in the era of cameras and technology. Why does this all powerful creator have to speak in riddles written by stupid outcasts that were probably considered crazy at the time and later codified by the power structure to control the peasants and keep them from realizing the oppressors didn't have a divine right to all the resources and power. You literally believe in a magical zombie that rose from the dead and didn't even keep his promise to come back during the lifetime of those who supposedly witnessed it and don't try apologetics (excuses) with this one. It's all a fantastical load of shit.",

It's just sort of been tacked to the wall to be pointed at since the decision was made. I'd expect there to be a lot more discussion over the details to come. \n\nWith that said, in regards to your opinion on late-term abortions, I would argue that they should also be legal. The number of late-term abortions compared to all other stages in incredibly small and almost always done out of medical necessity. They are also most often the most painful for the mother when you consider that late-term abortions are also most often very wanted. It's hard enough to find out that the child you've carried for so long, loved, planned and hoped for won't make it. I think that's enough on its own.",

Although I agree that it is currently rare, the reason this point is worth exploring is that the \u201cage\u201d of viability is decreasing with medical advancements and within the next few decades we\u2019ll almost inevitably see anything out of the first trimester being easily \u201csavable\u201d and we\u2019ll have to face this issue where we as a society are systematically killing babies immorally, because they are going out of their way to do it when the child can live without the host*, if the parasite/host language must be used!",

Personally I think that can\u2019t possibly be there until the brain has become a functioning and recognizably *human* brain - not just a primitive mammalian monkey-like brain that is still just growing its parts and not actually working yet. So, it turns out that for the first 100 days of pregnancy, a human embryo is really only growing, first, a generic mammal brain, and, next, a generic monkey brain. It is only after 100 days that the embryonic human brain starts doing something really different from an embryonic monkey brain: monkeys stop adding new neurons at day 100 but the embryonic human brain accelerates right around then, adding neurons like crazy. And even then the new neurons are still not all hooked up. There\u2019s a ton of neuron migration - neurons actually crawling round inside the brain, migrating around, growing axons, & tons of random synapses forming (the majority of which get pruned out later). So even at the midpoint of gestation, though there\u2019s clearly a lot of construction going on, a lot of setting up of architecture of the brain, the fetal brain is still not actually really functional in a \u201cthat\u2019s a human being\u201d sense, imho. It\u2019s like the construction workers are there and the rebar is in place, the walls are being built, the physical building is taking shape, but the electricians aren\u2019t there yet, it\u2019s not a working building yet and nobody\u2019s moved in yet. Anyway, recognizable fetal brainwaves don\u2019t become detectable until month 7 (there\u2019s random electrical activity before that, but it\u2019s not until month 7 that you see the type of brainwaves that indicate recognizable brain stages, like the brainwaves that newborn babies have). So 7 mos is my pick for when we can say \u201cthat\u2019s a functioning human brain\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthat\u2019s a person.\u201d",

There should be a point at which it isn't allowed.  Even in case of rape wouldn't you want to have the abortion asap not wait 6 months.

You good with that? Lots daughters were planning the same. He offered up his virgin daughters to the crowd to leave the angels visiting alone. Then Levi. There are laws that make no sense. Got a kid that mouths off at you? You can stone them to death. Only have one ball. You can\u2019t enter the kingdom of heaven. Says who? The 10 commandments were written by God.

Christianity _ought_ to take a lot of its ethical cues from Judaism, since they're built on the same precepts, and have a pragmatic and liberal view of early pregnancy.   but instead much of the modern Christian world has been hijacked by a bunch of hysterical puritans....",

Additionally, his son, Solomon (who Christians regard as the wisest man who ever lived), describes a stillborn child as \"passing from darkness into darkness,\" which sort of suggests the unborn child does not have an afterlife and, therefore, no soul. So I don't think the Bible quite backs up the \"life at conception\" the way many fundamentalists believe.",

What is the appropriate response in your mind to both battery and murder in one go?\n\nA woman choosing to end her own pregnancy is not murder. Someone attacking her to end a pregnancy is also not murder. \n\nSomeone assaulting her in order to end her pregnancy would be like some sort of hate crime. Assaulting someone is a crime, assaulting someone because you perceive them to be gay or from a certain country is a hate crime. Attacking a woman *because she\u2019s pregnant* or because someone believes she\u2019s pregnant would fall into a similar line with that to me regardless of wether the pregnancy gets terminated or not. It\u2019s a special form of assault at best, but it is not murder, no. \n\nThe only person who should decide to end or continue a pregnancy should be the person who actually physically has to endure it, not outsiders. If you want to decide on a pregnancy, go get yourself pregnant. \n\nLet\u2019s try another scenario. A ten year old girl gets raped. She falls pregnant, an unfortunate possibility. You will force a 10 year old girl to carry a fetus for 9 months and give birth, even potentially killing the 10 year old girl instead of allowing her to terminate the pregnancy, allow her to recover from the sexual assault as best she can, and try to have a childhood? Open season at the local elementary and middle schools, trading the actual existing lives of girls?",

To treat it otherwise is a delusion. There are countless other places to get better direction for a moral and ethical existence for today, written or otherwise. The bible does not in any way address the complexity of modern moral discussion over abortion any more than it does for human life in general- the religious are being manipulated and swayed for political and monetary gain, fed by fanatical fearmongering of the other. While I would pity them, their need to force the rest of us into their way of living and thinking is what is immoral and unethical.",

More than that, if that's actually what he meant, it means there are absolutely zero scriptures that condemn pedophilia. Bestiality, incest, and yes homosexuality, are explicitly condemned, but not pedophilia.\n\n\nAlso fun, what's condemned even way more than homosexuality is idolatry, aka using idols in worship. You know, like crosses, or statues of saints, etc. God straight up murdered thousands of people for using an idol to worship him.",

There's *nothing* in that verse about the location that the act takes place, *nothing* specifying that it only applies to certain cultures or at certain times, *nothing* about foreign festivals, and *nothing* about whether the act is consensual or non-consensual. There's also *nothing* about the age of the participants beyond using the word for \"adult man\" both times- but note that Mosaic law considers a boy to be an adult from his early teens onward, which is not the sort of thing that's consistent with a culture which has figured out that \"children having sex = bad\". Anyone who tells you that the verse *does* say any of those things is **lying to you**. With [very few exceptions](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/gay/long.htm), the same is true about [the rest of the homophobic verses](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/homosexuality.html) in both the Hebrew Old Testament and in the Greek New Testament.\n\nThis act of revisionist propaganda is every bit as slimy and dishonest as trying to claim that the Bible doesn't endorse slavery, or that the US Civil War was about \"States Rights\", or that the Holocaust never happened. And in addition to *that*, it's *also* a sneaky attempt to justify homophobic propaganda that draws false equivalence between LGBT people and pedophiles. (Ironically, not only does the Bible **never** directly condemn pedophilia, it [frequently encourages it](http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/says_about/pedophilia.html)).\n\nNow that you know better, /u/IgnoranceOrLies, please refrain from repeating this lie in the future.",

The choice of language is obviously a little bit skewed, but that line was most likely written about the pedophilic tendencies of Grecian society, and had absolutely nothing to do with the general aspect of homosexuality that people like to attribute it to.",

The Apostle Paul puts them together *arsenokoites* in the new testament. If those words meant homosexual in the OT then they mean the same in the NT. I love Mel White but his argument on that count was debunked.",

With the \"it's complicated\" caveat, emerging from the birth canal is when the baby is considered \"alive\"\n\n\nhttps://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Oholot.7.6?ven=Mishnah_Yomit_by_Dr._Joshua_Kulp&vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\n\n>If a woman is having trouble giving birth, they cut up the child in her womb and brings it forth limb by limb, because her life comes before the life of [the child]. But if the greater part has come out, one may not touch it, for one may not set aside one person's life for that of another.\n\nhttps://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/abortion-in-jewish-thought/\n\n>The principal biblical source for Jewish law on abortion is a passage in Exodus (Exodus 21:22-23) concerning a case in which two men are fighting and injure a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry. The verse states that if no other harm is done, the person who caused the damage must pay compensatory damages, but if there is further harm, then he should pay with his life. The common rabbinic interpretation is that if the only harm that comes to the woman is the loss of the fetus, it is treated as a case of property damage \u2014 not murder.\n\n>In Jewish law, a fetus attains the status of a full person only at birth. Sources in the\u00a0[Talmud](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/talmud-101/)\u00a0indicate that prior to 40 days of gestation, the fetus has an even more limited legal status, with one Talmudic authority (Yevamot 69b) asserting that prior to 40 days the fetus is \u201cmere water.\u201d Elsewhere, the Talmud indicates that the ancient rabbis regarded a fetus as part of its mother throughout the pregnancy\n\n>the\u00a0[Mishnah says that if a pregnant woman is sentenced to death](https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Arakhin.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en), the execution can go forward provided she has not yet gone into labor\n\n>All Israeli women seeking to terminate a pregnancy (and have it paid for through state health insurance) must appear before a three-person committee, but in practice nearly all requests are granted. There are no laws limiting when an abortion can be performed, and a woman whose request is denied by the committee can still seek an abortion at a private clinic.",

Here's one example.\n\nExodus 21:22-25 (ESV translation)\n\n>When men strive together and hit a pregnant woman, so that her children come out, but there is no harm, the one who hit her shall surely be fined, as the woman's husband shall impose on him, and he shall pay as the judges determine. But if there is harm, then you shall pay life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\n\nThe NASB translates it as\n\n>...she gives birth prematurely...\n\nand of course KJV\n\n> ...so that her fruit depart from her...\n\nThe assumption is being made that the word miscarriage means what it does to us in English. (that the baby dies in the process). However, I believe the verse is only commenting on the fact the mother had an early labor and gave birth prematurely.\n\nThe linked article states:\n\n>The relevant phrase in the passage reads \u201cw?yase \u00fb ye lad\u00eah\u00e2\u201d in the Hebrew. It\u2019s a combination of a Hebrew noun, yeled, and a verb, yasa, and literally means \u201cthe child comes forth.\u201d The NASB makes note of this literal rendering in the margin.\n\nNow I'm taking their word for this here so if this an incorrect interpretation of the Hebrew than by all means I stand corrected. Like I said not an expert in the Hebrew language.\n\nOn the basis of that assumption however, the child could be dead, alive and healthy, or alive but disabled mentally, physically or both. Whether the harm is done to the child or to the mother, the second section of the verse applies. Life for life and so on. The fine is purposed for punishing the premature birth rather than the life of the child.",

At some point in the past decade or two, pro-choice people went from \"safe and rare\" to \"abortion on demand without apology\". To me, that seems to have been because of a shift in moral character. So calling an zygote, embryo, or fetus a parasite highlights that shift. Honestly, I don't think most people think that. I think it's a rare group of radical lefties. I imagine most liberals respect life and understand abortion is a necessary but unfortunate procedure.",

That's why they say heartbeat bills are effective bans on abortion. The problem is I just don't see democrats actually trying to compromise on abortion. When 93% of abortions occur under 13 weeks gestation, it would be so easy for them to draft legislation that makes that the limit with the exceptions in place for reasonable medical needs.",

No matter how dire, no matter if the other person dies, you cannot force someone to give up part of their body to sustain that other person\u2019s life. \n\nNow, tell me exactly how forcing women to give birth, an extremely painful, body-altering, *life-threatening* procedure, is not covered under the same principle?",

The only cure is a very rare bone marrow type, one that only I have. The government cannot force me to save that 5 year-old if I was the only person on this whole planet that could save them with my kidney, or my bone marrow, or any other part of my body. The family could beg me, the public could cry out for my help saving this child. Without my donation, the child will die. But at the end of the day, the government cannot come in and strap me down to a table and take out my body parts to save that child. If they did, there would be equal outcry that the government cannot take from our bodies without our consent. Can we agree there?\n\nNow tell me what the difference is in forcing a woman to give birth. Tell what makes it different for a woman to be forced to use her body, to have it torn apart and changed forever, to possibly *die*, for a fetus that is not even fully developed. Should we be allowed to strap any woman down to a table and force her to give up her body for someone else? Then why is a fetus different?",

You didn't change anything in the second attempt to make it different. It's still a false equivalence. \n\nEither way, I fully believe in giving women adequate time and resources to terminate their pregnancy should they choose to do so. But after a certain development period, they should have no right to kill their fetus (remove all incredibly rare instances of harm to mother or fetus). It's not forcing a woman to give birth.",

Talking about how you feel morally about it is, and what is acceptable to you is so besides the point and self centered.\n\nLike come on dude, Are you really being that tone deaf that you refuse  to see that  body autonomy is already fully on the line here because there are lawmakers getting ready to get laws in place to basically criminalize someone seeking any sort of abortion or helping them get any sort abortion. \n\nThere are lawmakers pushing for doctors who perform abortions to be punished, like we are beyond \u201conly a full ban is when I care to give sympathies\u201d \n\nLike they already tried in Texas:\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2022/04/10/1091927639/a-texas-woman-has-been-charged-with-murder-after-a-so-called-self-induced-aborti\n\nLearn to read the room dude, when you think it should be regulated is not contributing anything.

The scientific question is whether these developments need to fully complete before pain sensation occurs. So I've seen that it can start development as early as 12 weeks, but might not finish until 22ish weeks. Personally, I'd err on the side closer to 12 weeks. Fortunately this is really great news, because it still allows for 93% of abortions to be in line with my philosophy. I'm also in favor of the rare exception for fetal development disorders or survival of mother/fetus. \n\nAll in all, my position is incredibly fair and rational.",

Personally, people are going to have to take more responsibility in their lives. If you're actively having sex, even with contraceptives, you're going to have to monitor your body. I understand you can get false negatives for pregnancy tests, but if you're actively monitoring your sexual life, you should find out with enough time to act. \n\nIf we want a federal guarantee to abortion, we're going to have to compromise and 12 weeks is the great compromise.

There was disagreement between Christians on whether or not Christians should keep the law (and whether or not jews or gentile converts should or shouldn\u2019t). Matthew, and likely the Jerusalem church including Peter and James, thought all Christians should. This may have been the disagreement to Peter\u2019s face Paul referred to in his letter.\n\nPaul argues that gentiles should not be circumcised, and doesn\u2019t think they should keep the law. He explains his reasoning. Since he founded gentile churches, and gentile churches grew to vastly outnumber jewish churches, especially after the destruction of jerusalem, his view seems to have dominated later within Christianity.\n\nThe author of Luke and Acts thought Jews should but gentiles shouldn\u2019t. The major theme is first to the jews, then to the gentiles. The jews are presented as mostly rejecting Christianity, and the disagreements between Paul and the Jerusalem church are minimized.\n\nLater authors refer to law-keepers pejoratively as judaizers.",

How is that a conclusion from the rib thing? Says who? Why?\r  \n\r  \n\u201cIt is Jesus, the ultimate sacri\ufb01ce for sin, not the laws of the Old Testament, that make christian's now and so Nicene Creed accounts for the act of jesus sacrifice which you are wholly disregarding for your own viewpoint. \u201c\r  \n\r  \nAgain, what???? What does: sacrifice, curtains, temples have to do with a basic statement of a series of \u201cbullet points\u201d  (in modern terms)of your beliefs, uttered weekly by a billion people have  to do with what I said??\r  \n\r  \nI quoted, \u201cNicene Christianity regards Jesus as divine and co-eternal with God the Father.\r  \nGod, Light from Light, true God from true God; begotten not made, one in being with the Father. Through Him all things were made.\r  \nTHROUGH HIM ALL THINGS WERE MADE.\r  \n\r  \nErgo\u2026 he is the creator God of the Old Testament.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nSimple question\u2026 Does this make him the Creator god of the old testament? Because it sure sounds like\u2026. Why do would they make this \u201cprofession of faith\u201d \r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\u201cBeing atheist doesn't mean you can disregard the practices of every other religion regardless of what it is. \u201c\r  \n\r  \nNo\u2026 I can point out what they actually say and tie it together, with logic.\r  \n\r  \nYes, if you believe in the trinity then you believe that the old laws such as sacrifice, wearing different threads and so on (there are many others) are invalid and so my point still stands.\r  \n\r  \nOr you can state that is obvious he was a religious reformer, or used as one, but still lays claim to being equal with the creator of the universe and the \u201cwitness\u201d of what he did as that entity.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThe point is that when this was written Jesus had yet to exist, \u201c\r  \n\r  \nExplain it like I am five then\u2026 Is he an eternal God or not?\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI was simply pointing out that he did not exist and so it isn't \"Jesus/God\" as the author has stated but \"God\" due to the timeline and taking into consideration when Jesus in christianity changed the \"rules\" per say.\r  \n\r  \nYou cannot have your cake and eat it too\u2026\r  \n\r  \nThis is outlined quite well for christian's in the book of Hebrew.\r  \nI could keep going into muslim practice which changes it even more if you'd like?\r  \n\r  \nSure\u2026.

It seems that it's explaining how God made the first man, and that before he breathed life into him the \"man\" was just made of dust. I don't know if the story of how God made the very first man really equates to regular child birth. Like, I don't think Christians think that babies are made of dust in the womb.",

It's the passage that explains how God has determined that since Eve is responsible for original sin, he has decided to make childbirth much more painful for all women as punishment for Eve's decisions. It's sadistic. This is partly why Christians go crazy for \"pro life\". It was even responsible for Christians fighting against early precursors for anaesthesia or pain blockers being used to help women have an easier time at childbirth by taking the pain out of it. When a certain Scottish doctor introduced chloroform into the operating theatres to alleviate the terrible pain of surgery and childbirth, the church fought against allowing this because the bible says women deserve the pain.

This is a threat against women that if you are unfaithful to your husband God will murder the baby that you love in your womb and prevent you from ever carrying a child again. \n\nThe misogyny and sexual repression of women that Paul shows in the New Testament is a regression from even the ancient Hebrew views on women and sexuality. \n\nThere are ample ingredients in the NT to support the view that women exist only for the subservience of men and the incubation of babies. \n\nFurther, there are multiple instances where both the late OT prophets and Paul reference that God knew them as individuals already in their mother's womb, which supports the life at conception view held by Christians. \n\nThey understand their Bible, it's just a shitty book written by horrible people.",

Scholars and theologians have been writing commentaries on every single verse in the Bible for thousands of years. They are way ahead of you or I in thinking through these issues of interpretation. The fact that all those years of interpretation ignore the possibility of this passage applying to abortion speaks volumes. Especially considering that abortion didn\u2019t become a hit button issue for Christian\u2019s until the 80s. Prior to that it wouldn\u2019t have been controversial for a scholar to suggest the passage meant abortion, and yet they weren\u2019t saying that.",

To rephrase that, if its replicatable with basic knowledge outside of the temple, it isn't mysticism and it isn't god.   There are two plants that were contemporary with that passage that could be ground up to dust and used as described, one is wormwood and one is silphium.  That is a matter of historical record.  \n\nFurthermore, as I've already mentioned, the commentaries you're so fond of tend to have glaringly obvious omissions which were deliberately omitted to construct a specific narrative.    You might not be aware, but that is in and of itself a sin and its pretty high up on the list of what God EXPLICITLY told us not to do.   Jesus himself spoke out against things like that in the Bible itself.   Modern Christianity in the states is a parody of itself.

In my mind the main reason for not seeing this passage as being about abortion is because in a patriarchal society where women are little more than property, abortion doesn\u2019t really help the man and this passage is to give men a recourse to confront and punish their wives for adultery if they were unable to catch them in the act. It also places limits on a man\u2019s ability to cast aside his wife and children and just claim they aren\u2019t his. No paternity tests yet you see. The priest performs a ritual and God intervenes. If nothing happens woman is innocent and man steps up. If she\u2019s guilty God punishes her and makes her barren. A woman\u2019s value was her ability to produce children, so this is almost as bad as death. Divorce would have certainly followed and no man would have taken an adulteress barren woman, so she might as well have died. The idea that this passage could be about abortion, the concept that a woman could get rid of an unwanted pregnancy and hence avoid the consequences of such doesn\u2019t fit at all. It\u2019s really the opposite.",

Picking that apart would take a novel.  A consistent theme throughout the New Testament over and over again is to love and forgive and not to judge. Nothing about protesting in front of a planned parenthood with signs calling women whores and sluts fits even remotely with the Bible. \n\nSecond I would argue that the Bible takes the opposite view of life beginning at conception with the practice of a brisk. Jews didn\u2019t even name their children until the 8th day because infant mortality was so high. If they truly believed life began at conception wouldn\u2019t they name their children sooner? And you can\u2019t just dismiss this as Old Testament Law like Christian\u2019s are prone to do with inconvenient passages because Jesus not any of his apostles ever contradicted or condemned this practice. And it came up. The New Testament is full of the debate about circumcising boys which happens at the brisk. The apostles went back and forth on the issue, and never once in all the back and forth do they mention anything about babies and conception even though it was intrinsically related to the ritual they were discussing. For me that reinforces the belief that they just weren\u2019t worried about abortion. \n\nLogically, with the rate of infant mortality and women dying in child birth, it seems kinda ludicrous to think that ancient cultures would have held a modern view around the sanctity of life at conception. To believe that would require them to believe that God was allowing their sacrificed children to die at alarming rates. Which leads me to believe that abortion would have been seen as a minor thing most likely. \n\nLastly, the Bible is full of condemnation of sinful behavior over and over again. And abortion just doesn\u2019t make the list explicitly ever. \n\nJust a few of what I see as relevant points against modern evangelical and catholic political positions in abortion.",

The moral thing to do would be to educate people on birth control options, safe sex, and if a woman truly is in a situation where she needs an abortion then we need to study why.\n\nWe haven't really examined the why in a long time, but last time we checked 75% of them were because of food and housing scarcity.   Making it illegal isn't going to reduce the amount of abortions, its just going to cause people to get hurt.  Meanwhile the 60 years of political theater regarding making it illegal, which does nothing to address the actual issue, has been more about feelings than getting results.  Also, paradoxically Reagan made up a welfare queen to scare people away from welfare, but that welfare queen he made up with 7 kids wasn't getting abortions.\n\nSo people can't have medical privacy, they can't have any guarantee about financial security if they do get stricken by a child they do not want, and most of the penalties for proposed for getting an abortion are worse than the penalties for rape and incest.  \n\nFurthermore, Crisis Pregnancy Centers could actually be used to fill that gap if they were actually being ran as Christian organizations instead of the ideological hellscape they sprang from.   The main reason those organizations do not seek federal dollars is because they do not like accountability and aren't equipped, morally or ethically or philosophically or intellectually, to be giving anybody life advice.",

Abortion is permitted when a mother\u2019s life is at risk to save hers, and other circumstances depending on the sect and it\u2019s interpretation. The less stringent sects are very pro women equality. But Christians stole our holy book without permission, merged it with theirs claiming it was the new and improved real religion, mistranslated and misinterpreted and distorted our words to fit their bullshit while condescendingly thinking they know what it means or have room to reinvent it when it\u2019s ours and we know what it means, don\u2019t actually follow any of our religion or laws, but still claim the Old Testament when it suits whatever bullshit they want to espouse, while ignoring the other inconvenient stuff they don\u2019t want to do or know (like that there\u2019s no way Jesus could be god or messiah), and conveniently don\u2019t acknowledge all this.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_and_abortion",

      "text": "[something I saved a long time ago. credit to who it's due, but don't ask me what that is]\n\nThe following text was recently submitted as an\u00a0ad\u00a0to several conservative college newspapers. The\u00a0idea\u00a0was to challenge\u00a0David Horowitz's charges that many traditionally\u00a0liberal\u00a0college newspapers are guilty of\u00a0censorship\u00a0for refusing to run his ads against\u00a0reparations\u00a0for\u00a0slavery... or at least to show that traditionally\u00a0conservative\u00a0school papers are equally guilty given proper\u00a0provocation. It actually made it in to 1 (the\u00a0Hillsdale College\u00a0Collegian) of the 11 (9%)\u00a0targeted\u00a0papers, compared to Horowitz's 14 of 48 (29%). Since the author, David Mazel, was paying money to have this seen, I hope it's not destructively violating\u00a0copyright\u00a0to air it here, since the argument's rather clever. (Several of my friends have pointed out that the\u00a0Bible\u00a0verses used are taken completely out of\u00a0context\u00a0-- I haven't personally checked to see how reading the surrounding verses would affect\u00a0interpretation\u00a0on each. I was amused nonetheless.)\u00a0\n\nAccording to the Holy Bible\u00a0abortion\u00a0is not murder.\n\nTHERE ARE ONLY TWO passages in the Bible that speak directly to the issue of\u00a0abortion, and both indicate\u00a0unequivocally that abortion is not murder:\n\n* In\u00a0Ex. 21:22-25,\u00a0God\u00a0tells us what to do if a man who is\u00a0brawling\u00a0knocks against a\u00a0pregnant\u00a0woman. If the woman dies, the principle of \"life for life\" is invoked and the man responsible for her death must be killed. If she lives but has a\u00a0miscarriage, then the death of the\u00a0fetus\u00a0is to be compensated for by the payment of a fine, as demanded by the woman's\u00a0husband.\u00a0\n\nThus has God revealed the status of the\u00a0unborn fetus: it is not an\u00a0independent, full-fledged\u00a0human\u00a0life, whose destruction amounts to murder. It is a thing owned by the woman's husband-a thing whose loss, like that of any other thing, may be\u00a0compensated for with money.\u00a0\n\n* In\u00a0Num. 5:11-31, God commands a husband to get an abortion for his wife if he suspects she has been\u00a0impregnated by another man. A\u00a0priest\u00a0is to make her drink a\u00a0potion\u00a0and tell her, \"If any man other than your husband has had\u00a0intercourse\u00a0with you, may the LORD make an example of you . . . by bringing upon you\u00a0miscarriage\u00a0and untimely birth.\"\u00a0\n\nTo deliberately cause a miscarriage is to perform an abortion. And who brings about this miscarriage? Who performs this abortion? It is the LORD who does so. God is an abortionist.\n\nTHOSE INTENT ON\u00a0MISCONSTRUING\u00a0the Bible for\u00a0political ends\u00a0will no doubt persist in\u00a0denying the facts. But it is time for these\u00a0anti-abortion\u00a0zealots\u00a0to admit that their position\u00a0contradicts God's moral law as revealed in the Bible. They should stop misrepresenting the biblical truth.\u00a0\n\nIn fact, God is an abortionist.\n\ntext found at http://www.angelfire.com/co/eveningsun/biblead1.html",

Ever wonder why we KEEP HAVING THE SAME FIGHT? \n\nThe actual pro-life group is very very very small but they have a LOT OF MONEY. Why? Easy. It's financially beneficial for the USA to fight amongst itself while your privacy is erroded, while nuclear waste is stored in your backyard, while fracking with cancerous chemicals kills children in Pennsylvania. All sorts of new laws and scams quietly get passed when we are fighting about Roe Vs Wade because it distracts us.\n\nDid you know, the Disney/DeSantis argument was merely a cover to redistrict around black voters? They gerrymandered right around all the black people in Florida. There is no way DeSantis is going to cause a Billion Dollars of damage to two of the biggest counties in Florida, nor will he hurt the #1 business in the state. It's a smoke screen to hide the fact that they are redistricting the state, and passing a 'martial law' and amassing an illegal army to scrutinize the votes and intimidate voters. \n\nSo the Roe Vs Wade is just a smokescreen to get us all riled up while the Republicans work to destabilize the USA. Their end goal is to create a fascist state where they can 'evict' people of color, gays, and others they don't like. That's why this keeps coming up. \n\nOur economy is falling apart. We are heading to collapse, but as long as we fight over Roe Vs Wade we are distracted from the 'smaller' stuff like privacy.",

At the end of the day, it is still 100% about controlling women's bodies. People really, really need to stop linking this as if the Bible is somehow pro-abortion. Geez guys.\n\nI'm all for ragging on the stupidity that is religion, but this just makes atheists look stupid. It's always been about controlling women's bodies. Nothing new with modern Conservative Christians. Throw all the religion in the toilet.",

Without thoughts or feelings, it lacks anything necessary to possess autonomy, it's not conscious. Why should something like that override the rights of an existing person? You and I don't have the right to use somebody else's body in that way, so why should a fetus?\n\nThe point in which a fetus does start to show signs of consciousness (we can see this with ultrasound, brain imagery, etc.) is generally the cut off date for abortions clinics outside of situations in which the pregnant persons life is in danger. This is my stance as well. I don't know any clinic or anyone personally who supports abortions up to 9 months outside of a situation like that.",

But she created a life in your eyes and therefore just has to die right? \nKilling \u201csomeone\u201d implies that this is a sentient being that functions separately from a host correct? Or you just simply believe that your personal beliefs should dictate what women do with their body? You\u2019re telling me you\u2019re absolutely comfortable telling someone they have to host an organism whether they like it or not? Wow. The audacity is almost impressive. Question. What bodily autonomy and medical rights are you willing to sacrifice for my personal beliefs?",

Edge cases would be effected you putz. But here\u2019s the deal, a woman\u2019s medical decision is none of your business. Super simple huh? But when people like you argue against abortion period, you\u2019re telling those women that have to choose to save their life. You\u2019re causing harm to women that have to have surgeries to remove non viable fetuses. You\u2019re telling women with ectopic pregnancies to just go ahead and die for YOUR beliefs. Btw roughly 1 in 50 pregnancies are ectopic. But you don\u2019t mind telling 1 in 50 pregnant women to die correct? So all around it\u2019s just you being SUPER cozy with the idea that based on your personal beliefs, you have the right to demand a woman use her body against her will. Says a lot about you. Now answer my question. Which medical decisions and bodily autonomy are you willing to sacrifice for my personal beliefs? Super easy question.",

So what you\u2019re saying is you want to restrict the 1% of abortions that happen after 21 weeks that are ALL medical reasons because you\u2019re too goddamned lazy to find out the actual processes? Sweet summer child. And how many states already have laws ready to go for if it\u2019s overturned? So you\u2019re okay making sure that all of these women who have their own legitimate reasons (which did you know aren\u2019t any of your actual fucking business) don\u2019t have access to healthcare. Why won\u2019t you just say you\u2019re comfortable forcing someone to use their body against their will? \nLet\u2019s take this further. Since you\u2019re so keen on the idea of \u201cdismembering babies\u201d so clearly you\u2019re trying to help kids. Tell me. What activism are you involved in to help the over 400,000 kids in foster care right now? You\u2019ve adopted and foster correct? Donate time, money, and effort? What about the estimated 17 million kids suffering from hunger in the US? You\u2019re also dedicating time and money towards that yes? And what about access to healthcare? You want to force women to have children, surely you then know the effect this would have on low income families. So you vote for universal or expanded healthcare correct? You\u2019re paying towards birthing costs in some way? You also advocate for accurate sex education and don\u2019t mind all forms of contraception being free, available, and encouraged? And you don\u2019t mind paying for such things correct? Because if you\u2019re super cozy in forcing women to use their body because of your personally held beliefs, you\u2019re actively working towards taking care of those kids and their families on a societal a societal level correct? You wouldn\u2019t just be saying stupid shit because unborn fetuses are an easy group to advocate for but fuck them once they\u2019re out\u2026\u2026.right?",

I know that for so many women and men it\u2019s very scary to have a kid. It was for us! Even if we stepped past the physical component alone which was big for us, the financial one was largest in my heart. But we had the benefit of knowing people would catch us financially if we were in dire straits and so many don\u2019t have that. I think we should do whatever we can as a society to help especially single at-risk parents in their efforts to care for their children. No one should be worried about food or shelter or the cost of seeing a doctor in the society we live in.",

They\u2019re heartbreakingly emotional about it, even\u2026. thinking about how they have to stop this holocaust and save these innocent lives. \n\nThey also believe that choosing to end that  innocent life is destroying your soul\u2026 so they also want to save the mothers from this horrible fate of living with \u201cwhat they\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re hypocrites for not supporting welfare, but i don\u2019t think that\u2019s intentional. Or at least not in the way that we think. Republican politicians get paid by lobbyists to push toxic and racist rhetoric abojt \u201cwelfare queens\u201d so they can get away with cutting taxes and lining their pockets. \n\nRepublican politicians see this giant voter base and use it to get them elected and stay in power. \n\nI don\u2019t actually think it has anything to do with controlling women, because nearly just as many women are pro-life as men. \n\nI need this sub, of all places, to understand that this is the product of politicians taking advantage of toxic religious ideology. If we don\u2019t truly understand our opponent- we will never win. It\u2019s more nuanced and uncomfortable than we want to make it. They don\u2019t think they\u2019re persecuting us, they genuinely think they\u2019re saving us.",

Outside of extreme medical emergencies I\u2019ve never heard of someone trying to have an abortion that is a fully viable fetus. That\u2019s just called birth. I don\u2019t think most people are ok with killing a fully viable fetus that can be birthed and survive without medical intervention. Again late term abortions are almost always medical emergencies. In the vast majority of these cases this baby was probably already named. Probably had a room made up for them. And the family is going through a true tragedy. Trying to redirect to this when it\u2019s not even the real problem at hand is disturbing. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/abortions-later-in-pregnancy/amp/",

In the third trimester where the fetus has developed all of its internal organs, it would be easier and simpler more often than not to just remove it via c-section and slap it in an incubator like a premie.\n\nAside from that, all conservatives refuse to acknowledge that just because an abortion was done, it doesn't mean the fetus was viable. Removal of a fetus that has already died from unavoidable circumstances or accident is also an abortion. Banning abortions means that people are going to be punished for having rotting, festering meat removed and ***that*** is going to lead to deaths.",

If your solution to child slavery was to have the government take custody of all children and then fine, molest, and publicly shame the mothers, that would be a much more accurate comparison.\n\nFact is there were abortions before Roe v Wade. Outlawing abortions doesn't stop them. It just makes women more likely to die during them. \n\nSaying that you should push for subsidized birth control or comprehensive sex ed, or universal health care, or childcare assistance, adoption reform, or any number of things that make having a child easier for women to survive or avoid, that's not a strawman at all. Those things have been shown to very effectively reduce the number of abortions, and they don't involve government control of women's bodies.

Because that would be forcing an Abortion onto woman. \nConservatives on the other hand do Not want woman to have abortions, which is the opposite right?\nI can get behind the idea that control over your life is probably a motivation, but this passage is not evidence that conservatives don\u2019t care about it in the bible. \nAm I missing something?",

But know that this comes from years of my own study as well as the study of many other peoples' studies.  So I don't expect anyone to quickly come to the same understanding.\r\n\r\nAlso by explaining this, I am not saying we should all believe this and live by this.  I am simply explaining the story it tells in order to refute false claims about it (like the ones in this thread an others).\r\n\r\nThe Bible is a story of a God who created the world and created humans to have a relationship with Him and live in that beautiful world.  Instead of creating robots, he gave those humans a free will to choose whether to love God in return, to have a relationship with Him and be in His presence.  Humans chose to be selfish and to take what they wanted and do as they pleased.  This wronged God.  This required separation from Him as punishment.  But this was not the end of the story.  God made a plan to restore this gap between He and humans because he loved them so intensely.  God planned to have his son Jesus take the form of a human and be born into the world, then to die as a human and be fully separated from God instead of humans having to be.  Jesus closed this gap and paid the punishment that humans deserved.  Now humans who acknowledge that Jesus has done this for them can again be in God's presence and in relationship with Him.\r\n\r\nSo in between the time when humans chose to wrong God and when Jesus righted that wrong is when the passages you are referencing occured. All the rules and regulations described in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy served as the sanctification requirement for humans to be able to have God's presence with them (i.e. the tabernacle, and later the temple).  Jesus had not yet met the requirement by dying and taking the punishment for the wrong.  Once Jesus did do that, humans can receive the gift of sanctification and of the presence of God and of life with Him instead of life apart from him.",

As educated members of the 21st century, there is much people don't engage in that may have been historically done.  And it is not because people don't give 'an F about the Bible.'   \n\nThere are a myriad of reasons why people--of varying religious affiliations as well as no religion--don't support abortion (either at all or some aspect).  The arguments I've heard don't center on \"controlling others\" but commonly hang on balancing the respective needs of one person (the mother) against another (the unborn child).   If they view the fetus as a human life--either because of religious views or based on their interpretation of the science--then a balancing test makes sense to them.   \n\nIt may come as a shock to people, but *not all* atheists support abortion either.  https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2017/10/19/atheists-case-against-abortion-respect-human-rights",

              "text": "I think your argument has a valid point.  The view is that the fetus is a human being, regardless of whether it is viable outside the womb or not.  As such, the question becomes one of balancing the rights of the two human beings involved. In doing this, one looks at what (if anything) the one human being (the mother) did to create a situation in which you have another human being (the fetus) dependent on her for survival.\n\nIn the situation of rape, I think we can all agree that the woman did nothing to intentionally create the situation.  \n\nBut in many instances, it was consensual sex that lead to the pregnancy.  Does that mean she should be stuck carrying a pregnancy to term? Not necessarily, but it is a factor to consider.  The law is full of balancing tests of rights\u2014none are absolute. \n\nBut between the rape or incest victim on one end of the spectrum and the person who uses abortions on demand as their \u201cbirth control\u201d just because they can is a a vast gray area.  And voters (not SCOTUS) are the proper ones to decide what rules they want, if any, on abortion.\n\nThe main point of the Dobbs draft opinion is the abortion question will get kicked back to the States, where it belongs, and the people \u2014 either state-by-state or nationally via federal legislation\u2014 will determine what the scope of allowable abortions will be allowed.  For the SCOTUS to make law in 1973 with Roe, and then make it worse with Casey some 20 years later, was an impermissible act of SCOTUS making law instead of the people.  \n\nThe draft opinion is very interesting.  I recommend people read it to know what it rules\u2014and does not rule.",

      "text": "Abortion isn\u2019t discussed at all in the Bible. Even the one you are talking about is not abortion but rather forced miscarriage. Makes sense given the age of the Bible while the term abortion is only from the 16th century.\n\nWith that little gem of knowledge you can find a lot of scripture on the topic. Also check the version being used as the messaging can vary widely by different versions. Exudes is probably the most notorious.\n\n>\tNJV Exudes 21:22-25; 22 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman\u2019s husband will lay upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. 23 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for life, 24 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\n\nThis suggests a forced miscarriage and puts the worth of the fetus at some petty fine while injury  or death to the woman (often seen as property) gets equal punishment.\n\n>\tNIV Exudes 21:22-25; 22 \u201cIf people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman\u2019s husband demands and the court allows. 23 But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\n\nThis suggest a premature but successful birth leads to a fine. If there is serious injury, like death of the fetus or woman, you are put to death.\n\nPersonally, in the United States, I find it best to simply stay away from the Bible verses. No matter their meaning they are irrelevant because the 1st amendment clearly states \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\u201d. This is why The Satanic Temple is so critical.",

To be fair though most current Christians believe the Levitical law, most of the specific laws in Leviticus and Numbers, were an imperfect framework leading to and fulfilled by the coming of Christ. So no longer applicable. There are any number of Jewish laws that allow or ban certain behaviors that the Christian church has essentially never upheld, either from a traditional or biblical standpoint. So while this passage could definitely be valuable in looking at Jewish history towards abortion, it is less helpful when considering the Christian church. And while again, from a historical standpoint the Jewish abortion tradition would be interesting and probably insightful in studying the Christian tradition and history, it could be a stretch to apply it to modern Christians today.",

Now. Start calling reps. Everywhere. Get organized. A fair and just law is celebrated by a nation's people.\n\nWhat we have here, however, is a division of the people. But it's not about this law, really. Its about control.\n\nWe are being lead to each other's throats by corporate puppeteers disguised as poltical fencers of patriotism. Daily.\n\nIt's racism, then it's sickness and disease, then it's education, then war, today it's abortion. It'll be something else tomorrow to distract us from them robbing us all blind of our futures. And what do we get? A new reason to hate one another.\n\nIt's corruption is what it is. \n\nTrump walked through 4 years of a presidency and made an open mockery of our laws and way of life. That was the testing of the waters to see what a crook could get away with in the daylight. And nothing happened. Nothing will happen, until we stop hating each other and look at the real enemy. Corruption.\n\nLook around.\nLook at the other countries.\nThey are all in turmoil. Rioting. War. Corruption. Genocide.\nYou want to read the Bible?\nWell let's give Matthew 24 a look - When Jesus describes the End Times. We're steadily heading down that road.\nDon't let anyone deceive you, either. Because there's going to be some crazy stuff coming. \n\nFor you Christians out there who are worried.\nDon't be. The war is already won. We have that good victory. Read the gospels. Share the gospel. And love one another. Love is the key. It is not a suggestion to love your neighbor. It. Is. Commandment. Full stop. How dare you judge others in anger? I do it too. Let's remember that Christ calls all to repentance. Thank God that his grace is enough, that He is enough. I would have you express your faith in these times when it is needed most. A good reward waits.\n\nTo everyone else. I know it may be hard to hear, but it's going to be ok.  Those judges are not God. Don't even worry about fighting them. Fight locally. Fight the states that are run by the callous and unloving. Fight for the senate. Fight for the house. Root out all corruption, And fight for good. A real good. A fair good for everyone. \n\nIt's written Love is kind, Love is patient. So brace yourselves. Because this country is about to need more love to those that are going to go up against this struggle. We are about find ourselves with opportunities to help the truly in-need. \n\nFight the good fight, which is the fight for good. It's not alien to man to do good to each other and to celebrate liberty and justice and equality. No one is perfect, but no one tries to be either. Let's fight for all the causes daily. Talk about them freely and openly. Invite the conversations that need to be had. Get to the bottom of all issues and be prepared and willing to compromise in the name of equality and love. \n\nI would have you all turn away from all entertainment and distraction and join hands in the streets with a March for our rights, no, our lives.\n Healthcare, housing, privacy, employment, wages, fair treatment of all from all authority and law. We don't have it and we should. We don't have it because they hold the power but we don't hold them accountable. \n\n Greed is our government. And Americans ought not be ruled by Greed. Is it not lady liberty that was a beacon of hope to the refugee for generations? Yet we turn the cold and hungry and persecuted away and take their children to lock them away at the border. It is a sin to our great nation. Yet it goes unchallenged. Challenge all greed. \n\n We're Americans. We don't lay down to tyrants, nor to corruption forever.\n\nWhen the French were assisting in our training for the Revolutionary War they remarked that it was only American soldiers that needed to be told why to do something before they would all follow the orders. I've always kept that close to my heart in regards to the spirit of America. We're not blind nor helpless. We're torn and divided but this nation still stands. But only if we stand together. So, stand together as one. \n\nWe have never blindly followed orders as the Nazis excused themselves with. \n\nIt is a good thing that we as a people feel outrage and disgust at injustice and corruption. We don't want it in our nation. We don't want it in our souls. It is unnatural to hate. Only the unloved, hate. You are not unloved. They are.\n\nI say again, there is only one solution to hate. Is it not love? Love each other, a brotherly and sisterly love toward one another. Give heed to the good and wise and just. Give your service to those who are greatest in love, not greed. And the reflection of the people, which is the government, will change. A true change. If the people live in love, truly, so will they be ruled by it.\n\nLove your post. Love your watch. Your life has meaning because you can make a difference in another's. And we need good shepherds. We have many evil shephards. Be the good shepherd. Be the change you want to see, as they say. And never give an inch to hate.\n\nRemember daily why you fight. This is our war. It is a spiritual war. We are fighting for the spirit of America. And our enemy is great, but we are mighty as one. It can be done. I have dreamed it in my heart. A world without this sickness of heart. A world to be desired to live in, with fulness and prosperity. One we can relax in and be free. Not some simulation. A real life. A good life. We can fight for the dream. Even if we can't ever see the dream in our lifetime we can fight for it. Is not the journey the adventure itself? Live now. Live today. Love today. Give your hearts to the strangers in trust and love and bear the sadness of your loss with them. Let the testimony and sacrifice of your love be their conviction and judgment. That is a heavy price to pay and I have faith that they will pay it.\n\nLast of all, be at peace. Regret is a terrible thing to feel. Do not regret but Live better, instead. Admit your faults to one another and move on. We have to relearn how to let things go with each other. Not every fault deserves exile and isolation. Some just need to see a better way and you can be that light. Love is patient. Love is kind. Be patient. Be kind. Kindness is not the same as politeness. Kindnevss is not weakness. Kindness is like mindedness with another's well being. Love them and Kindness follows. There is no other way. \nLove has always been the key. Love is the key now. Unlock their hearts with the key. And unlock their minds with instruction and learning and compassion. Don't seek to convince. Seek to educate. The conviction will come of itself once they have the knowledge. Does not the bird know that it is right to feed its young? Do you know what is right and what is wrong when you do it? Ask another who is great in love and truth, if you doubt. \n\nLove is the key.\n\n(1 John 4:8)",

But then Jesus came along and he was better, so it's all okay now. We can overlook all the genocide, slavery and rape that he commanded in his old persona.\"\n\n\n>I\u2019m no theologist by any means, and quite frankly my OT knowledge could use some brushing up\n\n\nIndeed it does. You should look up what Jesus had to say about the old testament, and ask yourself why you think you know better than Jesus and are able to ignore him when it suits you.\n\n\n>we acknowledge the OT but don\u2019t practice it\u2019s archaic laws.\n\n\nWell you're clearly not acknowledging it, because if you did you would have to accept that your god is the single most evil character in all of fiction. But that's beside the point; Jesus directly commands that the OT laws should be followed. The idea that Jesus abolished the old testament law is in **direct conflict** with the words attributed to him.\n\n\nSo why aren't you following them? \n\n\n\n>To address the last thing you said; was God evil and he became better? No. He wasn\u2019t evil to begin with because, ya know, God.\n\n\nThat doesn't address the issue.\n\n\nIf a being commands his followers to attack their neighbours, slaughter all the adult men and women, all the young boys, but to take all the young virgin pre-teen girls to be rape-slaves, then that being is **evil**.\n\n\n\nIt a being fucks up his own plan by creating two naked people who don't know right from wrong, and then gets angry when they eat a magical fruit that he put within arms reach (which they couldn't have possibly known was wrong until *after* they ate the fruit) because a talking snake that he *also* put in the garden with them convinced the mto eat it, and the only solution he can think of to try to fix his plan is **global genocide** then that entity is evil.\n\n\nThe fact that the being in question is a god doesn't give it a get out of jail free card.\n\n\nI am morally superior to your god. And so are you.\n\n\n>But even God has made mistakes\n\n\n\"Global genocide\" is not a \"mistake\".\n\n\n>I have never read, front to back, the OT\n\n\nMaybe you should. So you can see just how friggin' grotesque the god character is. He is, again, the single most evil character in all of fiction. \n\n\n>I am more aware of NT scripture and it\u2019s teachings\n\n\nExcept the part where Jesus directly states to follow the OT laws, apparantly.\n\n\nWhat about the part where Jesus directly condones slavery and commands slaves to obey their masters? And instead of telling Christians not to own slaves, he just says \"treat your slaves with kindness\"?\n\n\nHere's an idea: Maybe tell your followers: \"Don't fucking own people as property.\"\n\n\nExcept he *didn't* do that. Because Jesus is also an immoral character. Just like he at one point refers to non-Jews as Dogs, unfit to accept the scraps from the Jewish table, and implies that people who do not follow him should be killed.\n\n\n\n>From what I\u2019ve read/been taught (also my main attraction to Christianity) is that God is all loving and all forgiving\n\n\nPerhaps you should actually read the book, then. Because the character is clearly neither all loving, nor all forgiving, and ascribes brutal punishments for any and all transgressions.\n\n\n>we should respect our neighbors\n\n\nYou're right, we *should* respect our neighbors. Not...you know...commit genocide on them and take their daughters as rape-slaves, like the bible commands.\n\n\n>and have firm faith\n\n\nFaith is a firm belief that is held without evidence and must be defended against all evidence to the contrary.

It was in the first set that Moses smashed on his way down the mountain.

They're the ones that Moses smashed and rendered invalid when God replaced him; it's the second set that are actually referred to as the ten (although it's worth noting that there are more than ten of them).",

But it doesn't actually have any theological basis. The only statement Jesus ever makes about the old testament is to outright endorse it and to specifically instruct his followers to follow the laws outlined therein (despite the fact that he himself violates a number of them).\n\n\nThe idea that Jesus magiced away the old testament is a relatively recent theological invention, and it owes itself *entirely* to the (selective) Christian discomfort with the old testament. And it requires Christians to flatly ignore what Jesus supposedly said about the book.",

Doctors/hospitals won't do it, to close to the law, to hard to prove the fetus was gone,not viable or dead before surgery and women died daily as everything turns septic.\nThen think about all the other laws they'll change, gay rights reversed ,same sex couples marriages annulled, adopted children rehomed. Where would this stop, not till you're a subservient slave, de unionised, minimum wage, no healthcare lest you comply with all company and religious laws.

Assuming that the passage has been translated accurately (and it may not, the passage literally refers to a woman's thigh swelling, we could be talking about a literal disfigurment instead of an idiom for a miscarriage), we are talking about a miscarriage that was caused by the sin of the parent.\n\nMultiple times throughout the Bible, there are instances where God punishes children because of the sins of a parent.  God declared through the prophet Nathan that David's son through Bathsheba would die because of murdering Uriah to cover up David's own infidelity.  Korah, Dathan, and Abiriam rebelled against Moses' leadership, ordained by God, and God punished them by having their whole families swallowed up in the earth.  Clearly, the death of a young son or daughter can be a punishment for serious sin, at list under the old covenant.\n\nAn adulterous woman brought before a priest for examination is taking an oath before her husband, the priest, and God that she was not unfaithful.  God causing a miscarriage to reveal her guilt is the result of deliberate sin, not the result of the priest performing an abortion.\n\nFinally, an exegesis of Numbers 5 must be informed by other Scripture.  All throughout Scripture there are verses emphasizing how God knows us in the womb, how He desires little children to come to Him, how He has commanded us not to murder (that is, the deliberate taking of innocent life).  Deliberate abortion can never be justified scripturally.",

One is an ancient type text which has basically man gods (ie Noah living until 600 years old etc) and the New Testament, which is a freewheeling hippie who speaks in riddles. \nMy opinion is with that diversity of thoughts and stories, you can read whatever you want into it. And, if your main mission is to demonize minorities and women, it\u2019s very possible to find what you want in the Bible. Instead of taking the positive meanings of some of the teachings, it\u2019s a shortcut to bigotry and misogyny if you want to. \nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

To an ancient person the idea that the child was alive before being born would have been ridiculous because so many weren't.\n\nOnly modern humans with modern medicine massively increasing the viability of each and every pregnancy, would even have the concept of life beginning before birth because there's nearly a 1:1 correlation between later stage pregnancy and a viable birth.",

God is the ultimate determining factor in regards to the penalty of sin. It is well within his authority, being the Creator God. He does as he pleases. I would also like to point out that God later uses David and Bathsheba to conceive and bear Solomon, He later begets another and another, thus leading to the immaculate conception of Jesus Christ.

      "text": "Question  : How is Numbers 5 passages even close to modern abortion?\n\nThe answer is Its not.I can read and see; a cause and resolution to the controversy at least in Numbers 5.\n\nHowever In Most cases for modern abortion, its for convenience.Anyone that has lived long enough and known many women through there lives, and men, know why the got the abortion.  And That would be unfair. Because the root behavior of infidelity or whore like lifestyles is Not resolved.\n\nWhereas in Numbers 5's it's addressed. And Numbers 5 is not modern abortion in the least.\n\nThe scenario there is if ; the  married women cheated on her husband, and there is no proof of the infidelity, but the husband has enough reason to suspect there has been, but he has no proof, they go to the priest to inquire of the matter further were God Himself got involved to reveal the truth.\n\nThe woman would agree to the process. Which involved drinking dirty water, just water mixed with some dirt or dust from the floor. It would amount to a gulp. Not a lot.That was essentially it.\n\nThe key part of the process is the Oath before God.She would take an oath, before the priest, that would convict herself if, she was in the wrong, and her own conscious would convict herself before God; God knows all things anyway.\n\nIf she got sick afterwards , it was because God determined she was in the wrong; for sleeping around behind her husband, not anyone there.No one made the woman sick: Not the husband, not the priest, not the water. It was the woman herself, and God that passed the fair Sentence and Judgement for her own choices in adultery.\n\nShe would have developed what might today be called Ovarian Dropsy. Or some form of ovarian disease. This is not something man can bring about except save for chemical and other pollutants in the environment people contact.\n\nAt that time, dirt in water was not going to give you Ovarian Dropsy. This is not abortion, and the passage does not imply or suggest the woman was with child at this point. And if she were to develop that, she would not be able to have kids, to abort over, and over and over and over again as Modern abortion permits.\n\nNumbers 5 is Not a prescription to kill a kid, if you dont want it.\n\nSo, while in Numbers 5 this accusation is levied against the woman, by the husband, and that may seem unfair. If she was innocent, nothing would come of this.\n\nHowever, if the man was actually ever caught in adultery and there was evidence he was sleeping with a married woman, the penalty for him would have been death.\n\nNow, how does that compare to Modern abortion - where, the child in some states and many times has come to full term and they crush the kids skull, suck their brains out, and tare them limb from limb moments from birth?Or inject chemicals into the child, and burn the child alive, some have actually survived this chemical process. And in Most cases its used as a contraceptive. So You mean to tell me that is the same as drinking dusty water Numbers 5?",

And in that case, we're usually dealing with a fully devoloped person. So the fact that a fetus doesn't really have any of the things we'd associate with a conscious person, I believe it should be be legalized and regulated, not outlawed. As soon as we can terminate a pregnancy without harming the fetus, I'll be in full support of whatever procedure that may be.",

But even disregarding that, \"life\" can be so many things. As stated in this thread already, a tumor (just a clump of cells) removed from the body is life being killed. Is that really where the line is? Or is it only in the circumstance that you want it?\n\n> The \u201cuntil it can sustain its own life\u201d argument doesn\u2019t work\n\nI havent seen that argument before, but it is an excellent segway into why people (mostly republicans) seem to care so much for life until the baby is actually born, and then they couldn't give a single shit about it. Take them from their parents at the border, deny them welfare, deny the mother and child adequate healthcare etc.\n\n> The \u201cbody autonomy\u201d argument doesn\u2019t make sense since you\u2019re ending the life of another body\u2026\n\nThis... doesn't make it not make sense? All people have said is that literally after you're *dead*, you have more control over your body than a pregnant woman. That is absolutely demented\n\nLook, abortion is not an easy topic to discuss. It's always a terrible situation. People have the right to be anti-abortion, and at face value I cant fault the idea, but if you aren't 'pro-life' for children in all situations after birth, then you're a hypocrite and your intentions are questionable",

I don\u2019t see how there are going to be more woman then there are already who will want one because they are illegal.

Brain activity? Capability of feeling pain?) So it will largely have to be decided by politicians. Our abortion laws are currently some of the loosest and grayest of any developed country. We need some clear law on the books. \n\nMost pro-life people I know are willing to compromise on a \"personhood\" threshold that is somewhat reasonable, even if they religiously believe ALL abortion is murder.",

They hide behind abortion as if they\u2019re actually accomplishing anything for mankind because it\u2019s easy.  Why do women have abortions in the first place ? Fight those things first.  Use the guilded altars of the Catholic Church to provide for society. Maybe there will be less abortions then.",

The woman involved in the situation would be \"barren\" \"\u05e2\u05b8\u05e7\u05b8\u05e8\" \"a\u0302qa\u0302r\" or sterile and therefore unable to conceive entirely. This passage does not involve a fetus at all so has nothing to do with abortion. That was the premise of my initial response to you.",

It\u2019s funny how in Jewish culture if the wife was proven guilty by the curse she was casted out (implying she would most like die soon after in the wild) but here in America abortions are celebrated because it takes a strong woman to take control of her body and kill her child that has infected her. Also in the King James Version the woman who is proven guilty is cursed with rot and swollen stomach. The King James Version doesn\u2019t translated the text to a miscarriage in Hebrew there are two ways that it was translated rot of the womb or wasting away of the woman (Illness, leprosy, etc.) but no matter how you translate it is not abortion. The punishment of sin always results in death that\u2019s why Jesus died for us so the ritual depicted in numbers would never happen again it\u2019s a common theme in the Bible so I hope some of you will try reading it yourselves.",

What is in the dust? A: myrrh, which is burnt in large quantities as incense. What effect does myrrh have? Not only does it smell good, it is an [abortifacient](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5265628/). It is a uterine stimulant which causes the uterus to swell just as the verses in Numbers 5 say.",
