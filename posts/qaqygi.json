      "text": ">In 2008, a youth pastor named Jason Greathouse, then 24, moved into the Alabama home of a family with a 14-year-old girl. Greathouse eventually raped that girl and impregnated her. At the urging of her parents, the two of them got married. It didn\u2019t go well \u2014 shocker \u2014 and they divorced a year later. \n\n\nYet another example of how religion (rather than being the source of morality) deranges a person's moral instincts. Without religion, there is little chance of her parents reacting this way. \n\nCan you imagine being this poor girl and having to accept being repeatedly violated by this monster, while believing that if you don't allow it, you might go to hell?",

The woman may be able to initiate a divorce depending on if women are restricted from divorcing her husband but it would be likely she wouldn't until she had secured a new caretaker.",

If a group of people are consistently collectively shitty, they aren't christlike. Maybe they are what modern Christianity has become, but it isn't christlike. I'm not giving bulk Christianity a pass. I'm condemning it. Anathema is one if the more severe damnations/declarations. \n\nIn 1st John the writer speaks to a truth, \"men will know there is a God but how we treat each other (Christian to Christian). Jesus said it would be better if someone was drug to the bottom of the ocean by a large stone than lead a \"little one\" astray. Little ones would include all the helpless, forgotten, and forsaken. \n\nThis also ties in to the 2 main mandates of the post-Christ believer. Spread the gospel (not convert) and feed the widows and orphans. Do you love me? Feed my sheep/lambs. Christ directly speaks against the \"thoughts and prayers\" crowd. Hungry people?  Feed them. Thirsty people? Give them water. Cold/naked people? Cloth them. This includes all people. \n\nSounds farcical. I'm sorry it's that way. These people and droves more simply aren't Christ-like. Our mouthes and actions reveal who we are. If there is a problem, an inconsistency, that's because there is. \n\nAlong the way fear mongering hateful greedy people literally capitalized on Christianity and it's been pretty terrible ever since. Someone once told me is Jesus Christ himself ran on the democratic ticket in Tennessee, nobody would vote for him. Likewise Satan himself could run on the republican ticket and everyone would vote for him. There has been a pretty nasty bait and switch.",

The author has complete control over the story and is obviously writing the preacher to respond in the direction the conversation is leading him. It all feels very unnatural.\n\nI really didn't find these points convincing and I don't think any Christian would either.\n\nFor example, I was at a Bible study and one of the participants asked us to pray for him, he was having a medical procedure the next day. He had hearing trouble and the doctor was installing a cochlear implant. He said he prayed for God to heal him. God could have chosen to heal him through a miracle, but chose to heal him through technology instead.\n\nA Christian would argue that God would fill an individual with the Holy Spirit and it would guide them in all things, but it doesn't make them perfect people. In fact, God's plan may likely involve mistakes, hardship, and suffering, but we are to trust in the plan. A Christian might find themselves, homeless, friendless, and penniless, but as long as they are right with God, they are the richest person in the world.\n\nSo this fictional conversation may help someone on the outside looking in, but the Christian who is convinced that they have access to a superior source of knowledge provided by the Holy Spirit that we secularists could never understand would likely not be convinced by this dialogue. \n\nThanks anyway. I appreciate your willingness to share something you found interesting.",

I said, \"she's relying on me for transportation and to pay her medical bills. The only thing I want to know is what time her appointment is so I can get her there on time\" they wouldn't tell me because she had made her own appointment. Crazy stuff happens when you least expect it. Apparently, at the age of 8, kids can make their own medical decisions in Minnesota.",

Often, she says, this was to hide rapes by church elders.\n\n>She says she was raped by both a minister and a parishioner and gave birth to a daughter when she was just 10 (the birth certificate confirms that). ***A judge approved the marriage to end the rape investigation***, she says, telling her, *\u201cWhat we want is for you to get married.\u201d*\n\n>\u201c*It was a terrible life*,\u201d Johnson recalls, recounting her years as a child raising children. She missed school and remembers spending her days changing diapers, arguing with her husband and struggling to pay expenses. She ended up with pregnancy after pregnancy \u2014 nine children in all \u2014 while her husband periodically abandoned her.\n\n>***\u201cThey took the handcuffs from handcuffing him,\u201d*** she says, referring to the risk he faced of arrest for rape, ***\u201cto handcuffing me, by marrying me without me knowing what I was doing.\u201d***\n\nIn nearly half the U.S. states there is no statutory minimum marriage age despite repeated attempts to legislate one because of [political pressure](https://www.salon.com/2018/03/11/banning-child-marriage-in-america-an-uphill-fight-against-evangelical-pressure/) mostly from Evangelicals and Orthodox Jews.\n\n - March 2019: [This bill would have ended child marriage for those under age in Idaho.

Is it more practical to house these people in prison, or address the issues that are causing them to offend in the first place? \n\nIf you treat abusers like supernatural boogeymen, you empower them. If you accept that abusers are human, like your neighbour, school gymnastics coach, brother, father, uncle, etc, they become much less powerful in a sense. You can\u2019t fix a monster, but you can influence people.\n\nOur approach to solving child abuse by viewing abusers as inalterable monsters has thus far failed miserably imo. All the killing or imprisonment in the world will not stop the next victim from being abused, as we have seen.\n\nWhat is needed is a more nuanced approach that encourages people to talk about these problems more. Both the victims and the abusers, being as the two groups have overlap and feedback loops.\n\nThe solution to these problems involves deep societal change in both how we think of abusers and the abused, and how we attempt to treat both groups. As long as our solution is to lock the problem out of sight and attempt to forget about it, we are essentially creating more victims.\n\nDisclaimer: I\u2019m not suggesting abandoning punitive models all together, just that it\u2019s ideal place in solving abuse is way smaller relative to the whole.",

No redemption. They crossed the line once, they'll do it again. Maybe look up how many child rapists do the exact same thing again as soon as they get out of prison, seeing as the current system locks them away for a few years maximum.\n\nThese people are human, but they are also monsters. Humans make the worst monsters. Allowing them to be around children again after such actions is directly creating more victims. Once someone has completely destroyed a child's life in the worst way possible, they should NOT be allowed another chance.",

I specifically asked for priests who have been found guilty, not allegations against them, and what % of total priests have been accused? If you plan to just skirt around my direct questions when you\u2019re the one who wanted to bring up statistics, just stop wasting your own time.",

You\u2019re so faithful you\u2019re blind. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of news of the churches covering up abuse allegations and church has money therefore they can invest ridiculous amounts of money to support their priests. Guess how many priests caught and accused of pedophilia and rape have been kicked out of the church? Not many. \n\nTrust me the justice system is an issue and it\u2019s even more an issue when the guilty party has money. \n\nBut this isn\u2019t about the justice system, this is about priests abusing their position in the church to rape fucking children.",
