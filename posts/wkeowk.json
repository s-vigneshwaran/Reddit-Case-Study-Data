But our political system enables the most extreme candidates to take power, and our justice system seems unable or unwilling to do their jobs to curb it. It lets the vocal minority grab power and hold onto it. Look at Ohio - the highest court in the state has deemed the gerrymandered districts illegal and demanded they be redrawn like 5 times. Still the Republicans in power keep submitting illegal, gerrymandered districts and face zero consequences. The same kind of behavior is happening all over the country and even at the federal level. Hell, the last two republican presidents we had both lost the popular vote but won the presidency based on the archaic voting system we use. With the political parties getting more extreme, the politics are pulling the country apart. And with how the media works, the vast majority of the country doesn't get a voice because airing the bombastic stuff gets far more views and clicks, making it seem like that's all we are.",

So what's stopping you from killing people?\"\n\nMy go to answer is typically some variation of \"the same thing keeping you from killing people, I enjoy not being in prison more than I I would enjoy killing someone...\" \n\nIt's typically a Christian or Catholic religious person that comes back with the extreme bias, I guess since most of them aren't good people and need some sort of make believe guide book to be decent human beings they automatically assume we're all heathens. Which to be fair is taught in their book thanks to original sin and life debts and what not.\n\nThe zealots are the ones that refuse to live by the \"rules\" but want everyone else to bend to their beliefs without them actually having to do the same.\n\nMy mil took the cake with this shit. She was always the first to talk about how much she loves God and how great of a Christian woman she is. She started spouting some shit off once about giving my heart to God, I just asked her what number divorce she was on (her 4th) and that shut her up quick.\n\nRules for the, but not for me.",

I was caught off guard so immediately replied that it was disgusting what her and her husband do together so why was she even thinking about what other people do & that she needed to like and appreciate people for who they are or not, not their sex lives.

If it was nothing, but they ran anyway... they lived.\n* Example 2: \"It rained today. I did a silly dance yesterday. Maybe if I do the silly dance again it will rain again\" (no cost to trying a dance)\n\nThen when you think of the core experiences of human life: food, sex, death... you can see how various weird rituals would surface around those experiences.\n\nCombine that with a few clever ones realizing that those superstitions can be leveraged for power, and well.... here we are.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee also: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia",

They think folding stocks cause mass shootings, aren't they dumb? haha By the way, now that you're here, have some peer pressure to accept God. It's normal. It's normal to want to shoot gay people you know, do you want to shoot gay people? Not that we'd necessarily do it, of course, we're civilized here after all. But you know, it's normal to want to shoot them. All sinners, actually. And black people, too.\"*\n\nIt's wild, many progressives who play FPS games can probably attest to having seen some of this around. I've seen a lot of it over the last decade. Of course, YouTube gun culture is far, far more careful than range culture.\n\n----\n\nThere's also the factor that open Atheists have faded away almost completely from being a real presence in the media, it seems to be a taboo topic. You might now say very rarely \"I'm not religious.\" but you are not supposed to rant about religion like religious people rant about sinners.\n\nWe're offensive when we suggest peoples fantasies are nonsense, even liberals think so. Criticizing Christianity is usually fine, but if you touch anything else you're anything from an asshole to a racist.\n\nAtheistic views have faded away almost completely from progressive liberal politics and culture, instead the push is for secularist policy with a broad acceptance that everything is valid not only in legal terms, but also valid philosophically, as in *\"Nobody should tell you it's wrong to believe this, it's harassment and it's not right. Your beliefs are valid. Your truth is valid. Yaaass Queen/King.\"*, shit like that.\n\nHell, the big Democrats are religious as fuck, Biden himself included.\n\nMost liberals seem to feel far more comfortable standing with a religious person who openly admits they'd prefer Shariah law, than standing with an Atheist.",

In midterm elections, it's even worse than that. It's pretty much 25/25/50. \n\nIf Democrats could just get 30% of all enrolled voters to vote for them these midterms, they'd clean up. It would be a blue sweep, solid majorities in both houses.\n\nIf the Democrats don't increase their majority in the senate and retain the house, it'll be because over 70% of Americans did not want them to.

Sometimes laws have to allow things like this to occur to protect the rights of the woman (you know the only one who is unambiguously a \"person\"?) who would otherwise be compelled by the state to use her body to bring the fetus to term against her will, possibly resulting in her own death. \n\nPeople who are against the death penalty understand that many murderers would avoid punishment they rightfully deserve to avoid unjustly executing the wrongfully convicted.\n\n>Most people consider babies to be alive\n\nThat's an unborn baby, aka fetus, and it was \"alive\" since it was a sperm and ovum. Being \"alive\" is irrelevant. Every time you jerkoff in the shower, you are killing something that was alive.\n\n> at some point well before birth and are morally against late term abortions outside health complications even when legal.\n\nThe laws are about what's just, not what's moral.\n\nIf you want to grant full personhood to a fetus at some arbitrary point in a pregnancy, then you would also be obliged to give full citizenship to a fetus inside a hypothetical pregnant illegal alien who came into the country before this arbitrary point and happened to be on US soil when this arbitrary point is surpassed. Since US citizens cannot be deported, neither would this pregnant woman who is holding this fetus who achieved personhood while on US soil.",

Then in those messages there was evidence that the mother supplied abortion pills to her 28week pregnant daughter to induce an abortion. So the case became an abortion case after that evidence. This doesn\u2019t have anything to do with religion or Roe v Wade. The crime was illegal even when Roe v Wade stood. This is about the purposeful premature birth/death of a child. And at 28 weeks a baby is viable- this is known around the world. Making this story a political issue isn\u2019t right, the details are terrifying.

In both cases, a window is destroyed. But one case is defined as unlawful and the other is considered lawful. Same principle. You can even extend this to a child. If you smack your own kid, assuming it's not abusive, it's perfectly fine. If someone else does it, it's assault. It's really not that hard.",

They\u2019ve upheld the larger window, rather than more intense restriction\u2026  so this gets into \u201cwhen\u2019s the \u2018right\u2019 cutoff time\u201d territory, which I have no idea or desire to get in to. It\u2019s all terrible for everyone involved and there should be easy and affordable access to women\u2019s health at all stages\u2026 there\u2019s no debating that. She wasn\u2019t arrested for having a medical procedure though. Self management at 28 weeks isn\u2019t a medical procedure or suggested method at that stage. Unfortunately, the larger point seems to be about the dangerous precedent this sets with tech companies regarding data privacy and cooperation with law enforcement in states that have restrictive abortion policies.",

If she wants to terminate the pregnancy at any time, I believe it's her right to do so, no matter how horrific an act you or I think it is. I don't think the state should not be able to compel a person to undergo any medical procedure (yes, giving birth is a medical procedure) for the benefit of another.

Move somewhere else!\"\n\nI deleted my Facebook 6 years ago, there have been no negative consequences. I also didn't enjoy living in the Midwest, so I moved to the west coast. Moving can be expensive and usually involves a job change that may not be possible for everyone, but I see absolutely no reason why people would be unable to quit Facebook unless they for some reason needed it for work or something.",

I do wish they would expand and add a couple things though.\n\nFor example, open source and free seem to be the default and thus don\u2019t have tags, while I feel like they should.  Similarly some of the tools are free with optional paid features but don\u2019t get a tag, I\u2019m not sure if the tag was just missed (some have freemium tags for example) or if they don\u2019t count certain payment types.

Zuckerberg replied that efforts to expand encryption across the platform will \u201ckeep people safe,\u201d CyberScoop reported. In May, Meta\u2019s VP of HR, Janelle Gale, told **employees they were not allowed to discuss abortion at work**, according to the Verge. The company later announced that it will reimburse employees who find they must travel to a different state to seek an abortion.\n\n>Still, Meta has remained largely silent on how it will moderate abortion content in general. However, **users recently noticed that Instagram and Facebook posts about acquiring abortion pills such as mifepristone were being systematically removed**. At the same time, **Meta continued to earn revenue from *anti-abortion advertisements* containing dangerous misinformation**, Media Matters found. An investigation by the Markup discovered that **Facebook was collecting data from users interacting with abortion services websites, and subequently made that information available to anti-abortion groups.**",

You don't even have a Facebook account but an embedded tracker on a page has now potentially told them you've scheduled an abortion, and they'll tell anyone who pays them  \n  \nAnd it transcends state lines. States can know you've scheduled an abortion in another state.",

Suddenly a \u201crevelation\u201d from god appeared just in time to save their no tax haven that it was ok to ordain black people, who until now were seen as those souls who had not directly fought against God In his totally LARPING war with satan but had just sat on the fence , not fighting for him either and thus god made them be born with blackened skin unlike those pure white folks who fought with god. This is the level of crazy we are ok with and its not ok if you get special rights from the government to perpetuate your nonsense in schools, hospitals and society if you can just banish people who breach your arbitrary rules just because they were \u201cborn wrong \u201c\n\nWe dont tolerate religious exemption for racism, we shouldnt for homophobia either",

Even at 24 weeks a fetus is only *potentially* viable, meaning they can sustain life on their own, so prior to that stage it\u2019s not a viable living being it\u2019s only in the process of being developed. Which is why the latest medical abortions typically happen no later than 24 weeks\u2026anything beyond that is simply birth. Even after birth, babies do not have a 100% survival rate. \n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, until that fetus is fully viable and can survive without being in the womb and sustained by the mother, an abortion is acceptable. You may disagree. But until that fetus becomes a life *of its own* the decision to continue sustaining the pregnancy is the mother\u2019s, and hers alone, as it is her body, her cells, her energy, and her life in that womb.",

There's already numerous exmaples of women being denied miscarriage care, or being investigated after a miscarriage becuase the laws treat the *unintentional* loss of a fetus *exactly the same* as intentional loss of a fetus.\n\nSo no, the suicide-accident exmaple you gave is just flatly wrong and misrepresentative.",

She should have been able to have a legal abortion. \n\nI know this thought makes the viability crowd uncomfortable, but restricting later-term abortion leads to maternal death, illness, and situations like this. Nearly all later-term abortions are to save the life of the mother or because the fetus won\u2019t survive after birth with any quality of life. The rare exceptions tend to involve women who didn\u2019t realize they were pregnant until they were further along and/or had trouble getting an abortion scheduled earlier in the pregnancy. \n\nIf we thought of abortion from the perspective of the woman, i.e., as basic healthcare, instead of from the perspective of the fetus - which should not have the legal right to hijack another person\u2019s body to survive even if you want to think of it as a person, it becomes a more straightforward issue.\n\nSo, no, this is not \u201cfucking murder\u201d.

Even if the app itself is flawless, and no quantum computers which would make current day encryption really easy to retroactively crack were on the horizon, we shouldn't trust it.\n\nMaybe you or the other person isn't trust worthy?\n\nMaybe you or the other person's phone isn't properly secured or out-of-date?\n\nMaybe you or they don't practice good digital security and privacy habits?\n\nMaybe someone you don't trust has access to either their phone, or yours?\n\nMaybe there is an unknown vulnerability that the public isn't aware of?\n\nMaybe they go through an airport/police/another agency? Security can confiscate their phone to get their data (they sometimes do it randomly, and even your signal private key might be compromised depending on your settings and what kind of phone you have). I highly recommend making sure your phone is password protected and encrypted, and shutting off the phone before going through TSA or letting the authorities have access to it (they can force your biometrics to open your phone, but they can't force you to tell them the password, and your fingerprint/face won't unencrypt your phone when you turn on the device after it had been off), because if they plug it into their computer, they won't have access to the unencrypted data. If you have an iPhone, you can even lock it so it can only talk to one specific computer and no other computer.\n\nSo yes, do not trust any app with information that could potentially incriminate you. Do not even have your phone in the same room when you talk about it in person with someone, because some apps and phones might be listening (it doesn't take a lot of power these days, because modern phones have efficient co-processors that make it possible). Best to keep the phones away in another room while talking about something incriminating.",

The mother got abortion pills for her daughter who was 6 months pregnant. After the fetus was expelled, they tried to burn the fetus, then buried it. The girl was 17 & her boyfriend 22 and he helped but was only charged with a misdemeanor. Of course, nobody should ever tell anyone anything if they don't want someone to know. You know that old expression about the only way 2 people can keep a secret is if one of them is dead.\n\nI don't know anything more than this.

Burgess' pregnancy was estimated to be 23 weeks and 2 days along with a due date of 07-03-22.\n\nIf you do the arithmetic (and you know that due date is usually reckoned as last menstrual period plus 40 weeks), then it's clear that the girl was 23 weeks pregnant on 2022-03-08. But the abortion pill was (allegedly) taken on 2022-04-20, which is about six weeks later.\n\nSource: [Vice: This Is the Data Facebook Gave Police to Prosecute a Teenager for Abortion](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zevd/this-is-the-data-facebook-gave-police-to-prosecute-a-teenager-for-abortion?utm_source=motherboard_twitter)",

It is also illegal for anyone to get an abortion outside an approved clinic. Counsellors and advice on contraception are also [provided](https://provided.It) after the abortion is complete. It doesn't get any better than this. Maybe the rest of the world would like to follow us.\n\nAll the same we don't like abortion and still consider it a procedure better off avoided.

When doctors perform an abortion on a fetus that developed they do it in a humane manner by stopping the fetuses heart immediately. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find any dr willing to do a 3rd trimester abortion for non medical reasons though- even before overturning roe vs wade. 24 weeks is the age of viability (baby can survive outside of the mother\u2019s body)I empathize with a scared teen and studies show that these restrictions cause more back alley abortions that take place later in the pregnancy. However even though I\u2019m very pro choice, the age of viability is a hard limit unless there are medical issues.",

There should never be restrictions on abortion precisely because the end result isn\u2019t saving a bunch of tiny adorable premises, but instead horror stories like this one - arresting teenagers or, far more likely, increased maternal death and the forced birth of fetuses who cannot survive outside of the womb or will only survive briefly with a lot of pain and suffering. \n\nWhen abortion is restricted, people who find out they are pregnant later in the first trimester or even beyond have to scramble to exercise their right to not donate their bodies as life support. When abortion is restricted, doctors hesitate to administer live-saving medical treatment to the pregnant woman, like we are seeing now in Texas, except earlier in pregnancy because of their monstrous laws. \n\nI understand that the knee-jerk reaction is to paint anyone who understands why abortion can\u2019t be restricted as evil or whatever, but I maintain that reaction is born out of ignorance as to why most people seek abortions later in pregnancy as well as the dire and inhumane medical and legal consequences that arise from restrictions. Despite the discomfort and despite the fucked-in-the-head desire to avoid giving conservatives ammo at the expense of bodily autonomy (funny how \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d are always, always the thing we are expected to compromise on), abortion is basic, humane healthcare and absolutely should not be regulated by the government.",

There is no maturation (What a patronizing comment).of the discussion needed, because our discussion  about another human being's right to  bodily autonomy is meaningless.\nIt's sad all around that after years and years of pro- birther's claiming they provide resources and good alternatives to abortion, this kid and her mom didn't feel like they could access any support.\nThis is what an abortion ban does, I'm only surprised that the 17 year old isn't dead. \nAnd PROSECUTING them? Based on private messages? Outrageous.",

You can do voice or video calls, which are also encrypted.\n\nIf law enforcement goes to the Signal devs and requests your messages it is completely impossible for them to comply.\n\nDon't trust social media companies.  \"If I'm not doing anything wrong I have nothing to hide\" does not protect you when the laws change and suddenly you are doing something illegal (like having an abortion) or when you have someone who wants to track you down... The social media companies are always willing to sell to people who want your data and they provide information to law enforcement with very little safeguards.\n\nYou are responsible for your own digital security, take the time to educate yourself as to the ways you can ensure that you're as private as you can be.",
