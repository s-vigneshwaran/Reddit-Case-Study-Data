Try either Breathing Techniques, Cold Showers, Meditation, Yoga, or Microdose on Shrooms. Anything is better than what you're currently on and it's your body trying to tell you as much _by making you anxious about the thing meant to help curb your anxiety_, you might not be much of a believer in Signs and Symbols but I am, so whether or not you believe/listen/care, I've done my duty in offering up advice.\n\nCold showers, start with 30 seconds and it just has to be cold, it doesn't have to be _COLD_, you can work your way up 30 seconds at a time, one week at at time, 2 minutes is plenty. \n\nBreathing Excercises, all kinds, plenty of beginner guides on YouTube, ideal, beacuse they can be done anywhere anytime and they do work, the Human Body is fucking retarded, as noted by your anxiety issues, thus if you consciously take control of certain functions, it will assume things are cool and regulate accordingly, breathing gives you conscious control over some of those functions.\n\nI can't fucking stand meditation, I'll be honest, but there are all kinds of forms, not all of them are seated, some of them require active use of your mind and body, so explore your options, you'll be amazed.\n\nAs strange as Yoga is and as fucked a reputation it has, it does work. There's something about the make up of our body that requires certain parts of your body stretched in certain ways to trigger certain hormonal changes and balances, normally you'd get them by literally just moving through Nature and using Natural Movements, but given our modern world, we don't do that anymore. Yoga improves a number of biomarkers and will produce a feeling of inner calmness and comfort.\n\nMicrodosing on Shrooms increases creativity and confidence while imbuing you with an increased sense of Empathy and Understanding of those around you, at microdose levels <.20grams per dose, you won't 'feel' much consciously, you'll j ust feel better. Comibining the Microdosing with the other regimens resulted in the greatest change for me personally.\n\nLastly, take walks, excercise. If you want an easy, Lockdown proof method, buy yourself a few Kettle Bells, the program \"Simple and Sinister\" by Pavel Tsatsouline has all you need to develop a comfortable physique.\n\nYou can't run from your anxiety, Anon. You can only learn to grow more comfortable in your own Body and Mind.\n\nDo with this what you will.",

And this isn't unique to substances that affect the GABA system, especially if excessive doses are involved. For example, ketamine or the infamous jimsonweed can cause amnesia as well.\n\n> Most doctors won't prescribe a 6-pack of heineken to deal with a death in the family, though.\n\nYou don't need a prescription for alcohol, though. People that want to drown their sorrows can just go to the next store and choose from an abundance of alcoholic drinks. And there are many people that do that.\n\nAlso I'm pretty sure most doctors wouldn't (or shouldn't, at least) casually prescribe benzos simply because of grief either. Of course, some people might suffer from intense anxiety and/or insomnia due to grief and that would probably justify treatment with benzos, but that's certainly not a given.",

In addition, tolerance builds over time and benzos come with not so fun side effects like severe short term memory loss, brain fog, anhedonia, depression, erectile dysfunction, etc. It's a waiting game till the side effects outweigh the therapeutic/qol benefit.\n\nIn addition, it's one of the most difficult drugs to withdrawal from psychologically as well. When you stop taking benzos, they cause extreme \"rebound\" anxiety. If you're someone who has anxiety in the first place, by stopping taking benzos you're not sending yourself back to \"baseline\", you're going in the negative. You'll be in a much more anxious state than before you started taking them, which is the whole reason most people start benzos in the first place.\n\nNot even talking about abuse yet here, just what years of prescribed use will do. Abuse territory is much worse, high doses that cause you to black out and lose all inhibition are extremely common among benzo abusers(ie, blacking out and waking up in jail, beat up, robbed, etc is all pretty common.)",

Tapering till you're mentally ready to jump off is perfect, really reduces the chance of a relapse. \n\nI attribute the slow taper to the little amount of post withdrawal symptoms I have, going CT or an aggressive taper seems to lead to more long term side effects from reading anecdotal experiences",

Peterson is a psychologist who has made his life about individualism and helping oneself, whereas zizek has made his life about communism and is ridiculously well studied on the subject. Having a debate with someone on a subject that they have studied multitudes more than yourself you're never going to be able to reach the depths that they are, they can even be fundamentally wrong but still win a debate simply because they've studied more than you. It was obviously Peterson's choice to engage in this debate, but it seems like an unwise decision since zizek is used to debating economists on this matter so is clearly more adept on that particular subject.",

Imagine the balls to accept a debate challenge on your home court and then just casually admit to being completely unprepared and ignorant, lol. \n\nI agree that addiction can happen to anyone, and there a lot of folks who've struggled that I still respect, but I think there's a peculiar irony here since the guy made millions telling other people to get their houses in order before pointing fingers or trying to change the world... and he's been an infamous pill junky for decades.

Long term though you still have some more mild symptoms and can strong cravings to go back. \n\nBenzos work on Gaba-A instead of Mu-Opioid receptors, and just so happen to have a serious seizure suppression effect. So when you throw that system out of whack, people can get rebound seizures even if they've never had a seizure before, which can cause the death part, or at the very least, a permanent seizure disorder since if you get one, the chances of getting more go way up. So they require a stringent taper over a long period of time to reduce that chance. You also get all the reverse effects from lack of Gaba-A like turbo anxiety and insomnia.",

I was instructed to drink normally before checking me in, they couldn\u2019t get me in for two days and I blew a .21 when they checked me in and honestly I would have felt comfortable to have some more. Got three years sober after that and then when I relapsed that\u2019s when I started getting DTs as mentioned before. Again no idea how much I was drinking before my second medical detox but I blew a .23 and they immediately got me on all kinds of meds, benzo taper, anti-seizure meds (I developed seizures after my first huge relapse when I\u2019d run out or go cold turkey) and other stuff, plus I was put on suicide watch even though it was a voluntary admission. All in all, if you can\u2019t stop drinking, get help. It\u2019s a miserable life and a nasty way to slowly go.",

Only problems I really had were the dopamine kind, you get hooked on it and things you do are fun only when you're on it, at least that was for me.\n\nNo physical withdrawals at all, but I was pretty strict to start drinking from about 5 PM onwards so not at all what you are describing and I suppose neither the amounts you were doing, for reference I am 6\"5' and about 220 pounds.\n\nAnyhow, good job.

So when you say \u201cit\u2019s physical withdrawals, dumbass\u201d, what are you actually saying?\n\n> Ketamine displays many interesting qualities for dealing with all symptoms relating to opioid withdrawal. Accordingly, it could be used instead of many psychotropic treatments, which interact with each other, to help with opioid withdrawal. However, the literature describes addiction to ketamine. All in all, although potentially addictive, ketamine could be a good candidate for the pharmacological management of opioid withdrawal.",

By binding to those receptors, it causes your anxiety to go down through a very complicated series of events that require detailed knowledge of biochemistry.\n\nOver time your body undergoes a process called \"neuroadaptation\" where the body changes to nullify the behaviour of the benzodiazepines. Specifically, it reduces the responsiveness of these receptors to compensate for the benzodiazepines constantly activating them.\n\nWhen you stop taking the benzodiazepines, the receptors are still less responsive, but suddenly they're not being stimulated anymore. In simple terms, the body has been trying to make you significantly more excited through those receptors to compensate for the benzodiazepines relaxing you. Now that you're no longer being relaxed, you're \"overexcited\" and get seizures and all those problems. This is the same sort of way many \"physicial addictions\" operate.\n\nKetamine, however, operates on a completely different set of receptors. It is specifically an NMDA receptor agonist, although the research you're referring to about opiate withdrawal treatment suggests that it might also be a a \"mu opiod receptor\" (MOR) agonist, i.e. it operates on the same types of receptors as opiates do. That's why it MIGHT be usable to treat opiod addiction. The second claim is still quite controversial. Notably, however, there is no evidence that ketamine is a GABAA agonist, meaning that there is no evidence it can substitute in for benzodiazepines in affecting those receptors\n\nThe interesting thing about alcohol specifically is that it operates on both the GABAA receptors AND NMDA receptors as well as a bunch of other receptors, so you have a greater variety of receptors that could be getting \"fucked up\" by the drug. Normally, when treating alcohol withdrawal, patients are given benzodiazepines which on ly stimulate the GABAA receptors to treat the withdrawal. The claim the paper on ketamine treating alcohol withdrawal is making is that it may be more effective to try to target the NMDA receptors in addition to the GABAA receptors, given that alcohol operates on both. If this worked, it would reduce the need for benzodiazepines in treating alcohol withdrawal.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that ketamine would be effective in treating benzodiazepine addiction, as benzodiazepines don't have any direct interaction with the NMDA (or mu opiate) receptors that ketamine can target.",

Being a gabaergic addict means your body stops producing the neurotransmitters that block undesirable nerve impulses aka you get massive seizures because there's no off switch for nerve impulses anymore. You can't die from coming off of opis, but quit benzos cold turkey and there's a good chance you seize until your brain dies.\n\nFun little rabbit hole: look into ibogaine as treatment for opi addiction, it's kind of in the same vein as the ket link you sent.",

              "text": "So basically what makes Xanax users prone to doing dumb shit is that Xanax drastically lowers inhibition and wrecks your memory. It essentially works like an incredibly potent version of alcohol.\n\nThis causes problems because you don't have to *intend* to take a lot of Xanax. You only need to take enough to be disinhibited towards taking more.\n\nImagine your script as having a beer. You have one beer, and maybe you feel a tiny bit buzzed, but you're fine.\n\nA higher dose could be like doing a shot of grain alcohol. You're not *super* drunk, but maybe you don't care so much anymore about having another shot? And then after that you're properly drunk and just dgaf and want another. And you end up completely fucked up because your own judgement gets clouded by the drug.\n\nThe line between doing a little Xanax (like your script) and a lot of fucking Xanax is only like a couple tenths of a milligram.\n\nThen you get to the point where your body is addicted to Xanax, and will literally kill itself if you stop cold turkey. Now you *have* to do Xanax every damn day or you'll literally just have a lethal seizure, or at the very least be in incredible mental agony for weeks.\n\nPersonally, I consider benzos to be just under opiods in terms of the danger they pose to oneself. They're not a toy, they can be a useful tool to function for some people with severe anxiety and panic attacks, but if you forget for even a moment that they're not a toy, you're going to have a really bad fucking time.\n\nAlso, doctors generally dgaf and will unironically give high dose 90 day scripts to literal children. You're very lucky to have a doctor who is careful with their prescriptions. I know it's probably annoying to have to convince your doctor you need medication, but it's better than the alternative of a doctor who just throws a massive script at you and tell you to fuck off and come back in 3 months.\n\nSource: someone who definitely isn't me knows a lot about pharmacology and has studied drugs for years for reasons that are definitely legal. They (who isn't me) also mostly just provide drug safety advice nowadays though because they don't like seeing people hurt themselves.",
