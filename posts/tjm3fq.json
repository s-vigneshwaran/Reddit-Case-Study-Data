Here's a helpful summary from Canada's health services.\n\nhttps://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/48642.html\n\nBut were you aware that even sex is not binary? Both at the phenotype level (the physical characteristics) and the genotype level (the chromosomes). Millions of people are intersex, and show signs of it from birth. Moderate estimates place it at 0.37% of the population. \n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajhb.10122\n\nThat's more Americans than the population of Rhode Island, as many Canadians as live in PEI, more Brits than the city of Southampton, more Australians than Ballarat, and so on.   These people were always known; usually they were called hermaphrodites back in the day. They often got exhibited in public at freak shows and such. The pioneering French photographer Nadar also pioneered medical photography with a series of photos of such a person (which you can see for yourself) in the 1860s.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite_(Nadar)\n\nThere exists a wide variety of surgical interventions and treatments that doctors have used to get intersex people to appear more male or female... even on infants and children, because their culture says you gotta be in one of the cultural boxes. Some countries are starting to forbid this kind of treatment without consent.  \n\nAt the chromosomal level, lots of people are neither XX nor XY but XXY. Some people have some XY chromosomes and some XX ones. Men with de la Chappelle syndrome have male bits and features, but they have XX chromosomes. And so on. There is a lot of variety, not a simplistic binary.\n\nside note: Gravity is a theory, yo. It explains a wide number of observations... if you let go of something it will fall towards the earth, and the earth towards it (observable facts), but \"gravity\" is just the explanation, and it is incomplete. We still have no idea what mechanism makes gravity happen, *why* having more mass leads to more of it, or how it applies at distance. We know that it isn't a force like any of the others. The best we can do is conceptualizations that get the math (mostly) right to allow us to predict where things will be moving.",

This man scoffed at the entire concept of pronouns *just because* it's more common to ask for people's pronouns now. Why is it more common? Because it's more comfortable for trans people. Therefore, asking for people's pronouns has connections to the trans community. I agree that it shouldn't, but at the moment it is that way.\n\nYou also do know that transphobia doesn't just mean you'd like trans people dead. Transphobia, contrary to what it sounds like, is simply discrimination against trans people, in any way. Yeah, that does include thinking that they're less worthy of your respect just because they're trans. And using somebody's pronouns is respecting them.

Right. Conservative estimates put the stats around .3-.7% in the UK, and .6% in the US. (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk \u203a ...PDF\nTrans people in the UK - GOV.UK, https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/ : literally the top two links of a 2-second google search). That's hundreds of thousands of people just on one little island. Millions in the US.\n\n That's the first point. As to how many people use pronouns that are not he/him or she/her, no, I haven't done the research. You are correct, the vast majority of trans people use those binary pronouns. But you'll notice at no point during this exchange have I even mentioned non-binary (they/them) or neopronouns (xe/xir, etc). Not once. Because that's not the point I'm making.\n\nAsking people their pronouns is like asking for their name. Honestly, it is, because that's what a pronoun is. A replacement for your name. The fact that you've gone off on one because someone's been asked how they like being referred to reflects your views on the trans community: a community that includes those who use non-binary and neopronouns. You showed your hand, just like the guy in the video. They weren't even a part of the conversation, but you heard pronouns being talked about and came to your own defense. \n\nNext time someone asks you what your pronouns are, maybe just answer the question and move on with the conversation? Without making it a situation where you feel you need to call someone else's identity stupid.",

If you don't understand the concept, perhaps spend sometime with really most of humanity and maybe it will become clear. Possibly more absurd, and less accepted than the absurd term \"LatinX\"",

If you go against the norm then you can let people know. That\u2019s the simplest and easiest way and hurts literally no one.\n\nIf everyone had to introduce themselves with their preferred pronouns despite 99.9% of people using the same 2 sets, what\u2019s next? Do we have to introduce ourselves and state our vision as 20:20 for those that are vision impaired? Far more people are vision impaired than use other pronouns so shouldn\u2019t we \u201ccompromise\u201d for them first?",

Personally I don't do it, but I'm considering starting. \n\nHowever (and I don't know anything about you so if this doesn't apply to you, don't listen)- if you happen to be a cisgender person, I would put to you that the reason you don't see your gender identity as a big deal is because your gender identity has always been acknowledged and supported by everyone around you. Most cisgender people have not had to fight to have their gender identity seen as valid, and by choosing not to take that for granted they can make things a little easier for those of us who have had to fight for it. \n\nI don't like to be forced to say my pronouns, but I do like to feel that I'm safe to say them. And the more cis people I see saying their pronouns, rather than just relying on people assuming correctly, the more safe I feel to say my own. \n\nFor me it pretty much boils down to the same thing as with any other issue of privilege- if you're in the privileged group, it's worth taking some time to think about how that has affected you and how to act in light of it. If you're not, do what feels right because chances are you've already done the thinking.",

It's the assumption that my identity must be attached to a gender, sex, or sexuality that is my main issue with being asked pronouns (not even that big of an issue to be honest). The day I realised I could just be me without worrying about some ideal of manhood or 'normal' was liberating. \n\nI realise for other people it is important and I would never begrudge anyone the right to express themselves, I only ask that my self expression be mine to express also. \n\nI was actually really excited when the idea of gender non binary became more mainstream because I thought ' yes finally people will stop caring about these stupid fucking gender roles' but true to form, humanity has found another thing to argue about.",

The group of people whose goal was to redefine English into \u201csensible\u201d rules used the singular they (as evidenced by its appearance in the King James Bible).  The use of a singular they even predates Middle English and Old English, going as far back as Gothic.  There\u2019s 1500 years of the singular they being used in English and its predecessors.\n\nBut, sure, refuse to believe in it.",

I've heard that using more formal phrasing is often common in secondary language acquisition. Common/colloquial English at this point in time recognizes \"they\" as an acceptable and concise substitute for \"he or she.\" \n\nYou're right that this used to be the correct grammar for ambiguous pronouns, but language changes with time. This way is less cumbersome to say, and more inclusive of others",

Calling an eagle a \"she\" when you don't know if they're either gender is correct because you would be referring to the word for eagle, same goes for every other animal. You'd be wrong (or guessing) if you were speaking English and did the same thing. \n\nAll of this applies to people as well, if you're just \"guessing cause it's fun\" and don't respect the rules of the language in the first place, I sure as hell don't expect you to understand the concept of someone preferring to be referred to by a specific pronoun.",

You\u2019ll find that the most treacherous and difficult path will be those that bring you further within and that the fundamental basis of your existence is more malevolent than you wished to believe.  But trust me, the light is through that malevolence, not in the group.  \n\nI would start with one hit of acid and work your way up to 5 dried grams of psilocybin mushrooms then perhaps a trip to Peru for 8 days if ayahuasca.

If I\u2019m projecting I am essentially using my experience as a guide along with my observations, education, etc\u2026and so I\u2019ve discovered that the progression away from the group is a natural development in the maturing adult and, naturally, those that remain tethered to group identity so tightly are frequently those that fear the emotional nakedness of independence and responsibility.  The shame produced by avoiding the natural maturation process is then projected onto the political spectrum where we can find an endless parade of reasons for our person failures.  Some of these reasons have more merit than others but the fact remains that attaching to the group that supports your particular ideology is more a result of arrested development than it is a shared identity with the groups motives.  I\u2019ve noticed the ends of each side of the political spectrum tend to attract the under developed whether due to cognitive deficiency or emotional liability.  I\u2019ve noticed the left has a particularly powerful attraction to those high sensitive individuals who have the intelligence to know they are essentially sabotaging themselves but, due to an over active limbic system, find it extremely anxiety inducing to leave the group.  And so my projections are that of a formerly anxious person who took the leap and found peace and tranquillity in the very independence that once seemed so unattainable.

It's barely political at all except for the extreme right refusing to accept it. Most moderates at least accept it even if they don't fully understand why people find it so important.\n\n2. You once again make a baseless assumption that those disagreeing with you aren't mature adults. You leave no room for the possibility that mature adults could come to the conclusion that you are wrong on their own without it coming from 'the group'.  \n\nYou speak of maturing, but it is highly immature to think \"What I believe right now is right, and anyone who disagrees with me isn't as mature as I am.\" As an example: you have different beliefs now than you had 5 years ago. It is probable in 5 or 10 years you will have different beliefs again. Is that because you are currently at the height of maturity and will only become more immature over time? Or is it possible for mature people to have different beliefs?",

In English, you have actor and actress, but in German you have that difference for just about every title a person can have. \n\nFreund - Freundin (friend)\nProtagonist - Protagonistin (protagonist) \nSchauspieler - Schauspielerin (actor) \n\nThe biggest problem, I think, is that they don't have a word to say \"they\" because \"sie\" which is they, is also you and she depending on the context \n\nAll in all, language is complicated, but it's an interesting development to say the least.",

If one doesn't wish to conform to that, unlike in English, there isn't a solid way for them to do that yet. They are either a female friend or a male friend. There is a push to make non-binary options, but it's much more difficult than in English. \n\nWhile this issue might seem strange, I think it is important to note that language is something that we use to communicate, and when we cannot communicate something fully, we most often try to make a way to do so. I'm not natively german, but I am excited to see changes :)",

Adding this at the end turns *nin* into *\"that person's\"* instead of *\"that person\"*. If we wanted the listener to know we are referring to a female, we'd say something like, *\"It's that woman's shirt.\"* Or, we directly address the person. *\"That shirt belongs to Fey Lim.\"*",

To us pronouns are based on wether a human is male/female (which is instantly recognizable and self explanitory). And ppl here are hating on other people and calling them bigots because they dont base pronouns on gender (something you dont believe in). Its like being called a bigot for being an atheist and not believing in god. \n\nSry english is not my first language. So yes this was a trick question and a shity 'got cha' thats not even a got cha.

The grouping has been moved out of the sexual disorders category and into its own. The name change was made in part due to stigmatization of the term \"disorder\" and the relatively common use of \"gender dysphoria\" in the GID literature and among specialists in the area.[22] The creation of a specific diagnosis for children reflects the lesser ability of children to have insight into what they are experiencing and ability to express it in the event that they have insight.[23]\u201d\n\nSo basically they changed the name of the mental condition because the word \u201cdisorder\u201d is too stigmatized. Again, activism. I just went through it and there\u2019s literally no scientific basis for the name change, and getting rid of the word \u201cdisorder\u201d doesn\u2019t make it any less so. \n\nThe hilarious thing about this is that the medical definition of Schizophrenia is similar to Gender Dysmorphia but only one of them is officially a mental disorder.

A therapist can help families decide whether these options make sense for the child\u2019s specific situation. \u201c\n\nhttps://childmind.org/guide/gender-dysphoria-quick-guide/\n\nAnd in the first paragraph on treatment:\n\n\u201cHow is gender dysphoria treated?\n\nTreatment for gender dysphoria focuses on helping kids deal with their challenging feelings about their gender identity. **It does not try to change their gender identity or convince them that they should be the gender they were assigned at birth.**\n\nSo a kid born with a penis thinks he\u2019s a girl and therapists don\u2019t even consider helping them? \n\nNow let\u2019s look at what WebMD recommends for the treatment of Childhood Schizophrenia:\n\n\u201cChildhood Schizophrenia Treatment\n\nSchizophrenia treatment for children is like treatment for adults. It includes:\n\n**Medications**. Your doctor may suggest one or more antipsychotics. These drugs are also called neuroleptics. They manage delusions (beliefs in things that aren't true) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't real). Talk with your doctor about side effects and other drugs your child shouldn\u2019t take while they\u2019re using these medicines.\n\nLiterally the first damn thing.\n\nSo a child has a break with reality in one condition (not being able to tell the difference between real life and a TV show, or thinking they\u2019re someone else) and is prescribed medication, and with the other condition (thinking they\u2019re a girl when he has a penis) they help the child live with the disorder and even recommend hormone therapy and surgery to \u201cconfirm\u201d their break from reality.\n\nIt\u2019s right in front of you and you can\u2019t accept it because you\u2019re conditioned to believe (by those activists) that it\u2019s completely normal.",

I explicitly said that irregular pronouns were fine.\n\nAnybody who wants to be called something different to what would generally be expected need only ask. If you look male and want to be addressed by female pronouns (**regardless** of what gender identity you have) then ask for that. Introduce yourself as a \u2018she/her\u2019 if that\u2019s what you want. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll call you.\n\nGenerally, if it\u2019s ambiguous people will use they/them. If that\u2019s not ok with you (and you didn\u2019t introduce yourself as such) then that\u2019s fine! Just say so.\n\nOr sometimes, they will misgender you with pronouns (like the aforementioned example of calling a cis-man \u2018she/her\u2019) in which case, correct them. Say, \u201csorry, but I actually go by he/him\u201d and most people will just go \u201coh, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201c and look a bit embarrassed for a moment or two.\n\nWhat you appear to be advocating for (emphasis on the **appear**) is that **everyone** should be introducing themselves with their pronouns, even when they appear exactly as they would like to be called. Why? Is that not unnecessary?\n\nI know you keep trying to make out as though I\u2019m transphobic, but that really could not be further from the truth. I have nothing but respect for transgender, non-binary etc. people. But the matter of fact? Most people aren\u2019t transgender or non-binary. It doesn\u2019t appear that way on the internet, true, but in real life I can count the number of non-gender-conforming people I have met on one hand. Maybe I would need two if it were those I know of.\n\nPoint is, those who are in the *vast* majority shouldn\u2019t need to explicitly state what makes them part of that majority. It\u2019s unnecessary and inefficient. I still don\u2019t understand what it is about this that you don\u2019t agree with - unless it is that you **do** agree with this, which raises the question - *what are we even talking about?*",

Based on my observation there are 3 groups:\n\nFirst type is when americans use the word gender instead of sex (because its a bad word) in the context when they are talking about sex, like a gender reveal party - youre not revealing a babys gender but rather the sex, because babies dont have genders because gender is not a physical thing. (ofc not literally flashing genitals). And the sexual stereo types that come along with it. So celebrathing that the baby is a boy/girl (male/female) 1 problem americans atribute historical sexual stereo types to genders rather than sexes.\n\nSecond type is when americans say that there are 2 sexes and 2 genders (bless those stupid idiots they need the any IO point to survive).\n\nThird type is when americans say that there are X ammount of genders. (im kinda on this team). \nMy take is that there are as many genders as there are people in the world so genders are literally meaningless concept because they are.\n\nWhile at the same time you can by any gender you imagine but you are still a human of a certain sex that i base the pronoun i use on you. \n\nThats why for example the UK is so terfy. They dont have genders but because of the internet and exposure to american culture its creating a clash and misunderstandings.  For example women were historically oppressed. Its for a fucking fact that they were not oppresed for being the women gender but rather being the female sex. And the sexual stereo types and expectation that come with being a human of that sex.\n\nTo conlude genders are like zodiac sings, some ppl like em some dont, and they dont mean much.",

This guy is not young, so would probably be unaware of the connotations of the question, so would have been confused at what he was even being asked. When the interviewer has his little gotcha moment, the guy obviously looked confused, as his thought process was probably \"then of course I fucking use pronouns, why the fuck did you ask me me then?\" The question was bait.",

Recently, someone got really upset because I said \u201cGodgender\u201d and \u201cpizzagender\u201d are not real genders. They called me transphobic more times than I can count. I\u2019ve also seen people who go by neopronouns like these on Discord, Instagram, and Twitter.\n\nYou can also find wiki pages like [this](https://the-mogai-community.fandom.com/wiki/Neogenders) on neogenders, which has a long list of 162 genders that anybody can add to. Examples: #162, \u201cWeirdgirl: when you\u2019re kind of a binary girl, but in a weird way!\u201d #48: \u201cDenfemia: Identifying as a woman but not being a woman,\u201d and #150: \u201cSupertaskgender: you are constantly finding smaller and smaller details about your gender, which is finite, but there are an infinite number of these details to discover.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also [this website](https://xenogender.crd.co/) which explains xenogender (the same as neogender from what I understand) as being a gender typically used by neurodivergent people to \u201c[craft] other methods of gender categorization and hierarchy such as those relating to animals, plants, or other creatures/things,\u201c which is pretty strong evidence that neogender/xenogender is a human-created concepts and not true genders.\n\nI think it\u2019s mostly 11\u201316-year-olds who are going through a phase and want to feel unique, so they call themselves these fake genders and use these fake pronouns so they stand out. It\u2019s not only embarrassing, but it\u2019s also harmful for actual trans people as it portrays trans people as these weirdos who make up genders based on their personality traits, interests, and feelings rather than just being people who identify as male when AFAB or female when AMAB; or non-binary, which adds fuel to the transphobia fire for conservatives and other bigots.",

What is meant by not believing in pronouns means you do not believe in the current trend of picking and choosing fashionable identities and wanting to force other people to think of you a certain way. People who try to police the perceptions that society has of them and the try to police perceptions that others have of them are little tyrants who want to invade people's minds.\n\nIf someone asks me what my pronouns are it makes me extremely uncomfortable because I don't like the thought of imposing how I ideally want to be seen into other people minds and I certainly don't like it when the same is done to me. I don't want to force people to think of me as successful, or attractive, or some other virtue if they don't actually feel that way. Pronouns should just be whatever the speaker feels they should be. Forcing people to give pronouns instead of waiting for someone to bring up their own pronouns of their volition is very discourteous to people like me, which is probably most people. These are people who don't want to give pronouns. And, if someone doesn't want to use someone else's preferred pronouns, they shouldn't be compelled to.(Yes I realize I used \"their own pronouns\" instead of the alternative \"his or her own pronouns\" but only because it was indefinite singular. Definite singular 'they' never was and never will be part of my natural thoughts or speech.)\n\nAnd I'm not saying that if someone has an incurable gender dysphoria, I would never consider accommodating them by speaking in an unnatural manner if not doing so causes them mental anguish. Like if someone with body dysmorphia threw a tantrum if you informed them that their legs are currently attached to their body, you might not bring it up. Or like how you might let Rain Man get his boxers at the Cincinnati Kmart because getting them elsewhere upsets him, even though his feelings are unreasonable and do not correspond to reality.\n\nIt's the same deal when people will say \"Trans women are women\", and if you don't agree with them you are a bigot. The problem is I am mentally unable to bring myself to agree; to me it is simply not so that trans women are women. Or people will say, \"If you would date Cis Women but you wouldn't date Trans Women you are a transphobe.\". But, the heart wants what the heart wants. I can't make myself want to date trans women and I don't appreciate you trying to police thought crime.\n\nEdit: If anyone is interested in learning more about this perspective I\u2019d recommend watching this video\nhttps://youtu.be/RnJHPOtcgo8",

The question of whether a White person can become Black and whether a man can become a woman are not related to anything physical, rather they are questions of opinion and faith. Saying a man cannot become a woman is not simply a belief born out of ignorance like one race is superior to another. I wouldn\u2019t want someone to be deplatformed and blacklisted for not believing a White person can become Black or vise versa.\n\nNow, imagine a world opposite to the one we live in where the vast majority of universities and all the prestigious universities are Christian and there are only a handful of private secular universities. In this world it would be near impossible to get ahead socially or career-wise if you said \u201cI don\u2019t believe that Jesus is the son of God\u201d. Those who defended the establishment would use the exact argument you did: \u201cfreedom of speech is not freedom from consequences\u201d. The vast majority of people who did not believe in the divinity of Christ would keep their mouths shut and heads down so as to not be punished. This system is clearly tyrannical and unfair. But it is not that unlike the real one a silent majority now find ourselves. Probably way fewer people than you think actually believe a man can become a woman; they just don\u2019t want create problems for themselves. It\u2019s like we have our own Chinese Cultural Revolution.",

That guy may take a more direct approach than most, but is it really rude? We don't ask people their age/weight/salary, maybe we should reconsider whether everyone around us is as interested in discussing gender as some people in this generation are?\n\nTBH, if someone asked me my pronouns, I might answer similarly. Or if a group leader asked us all to stand and tell us our names and pronouns, I feel very resistant to it. If others want to, more power to 'em! I wouldn't dream of stopping them, but don't force me to nor publicly shame me for not participating.\n\nI think it's perfectly reasonable to ask \"How about every stand and tell us your name, your pronouns if you wish, and something about yourself?\" and drop it if they don't wish to.",

Here let me show you, you see someone that looks like their a male/female and you identify them as such, turns out they're trans and have body dismorphia that causes them to constantly be insecure about their looks and hate that they look like the gender that you just identified them as. They had gone out that day, probably trying to look like the gender they say they are, thinking they look good, then you come along and bring them down.\n\nYou're so concerned about people's feelings when it's not people that are trans, and it's obvious based off of one of your comments that said something along the lines of \"well then they aren't passing and you're letting them know that.\" Why can't you do the same for people that are cis?

The myriad of women who didn't act \"womanly\" pissed people off.\n\nAt some point fairly recently in history, western societies adopted a stricter set of gender norms. There are people today who rant and rave about women wearing pants and men wearing dresses. There are people today who scream and cry about \"the death of gender norms\" anytime someone mentions they are non-binary or agender.\n\nThe point is, much of society still has the idea that there are gender norms and have decided that any trans or otherwise genderqueer identity is a taboo.

Again, you are so close, but you still somehow find a way to miss the mark. While it's true that not everyone who plays with gender presentation identifies genderqueer, genderqueer people are still seen as being kind of taboo.\n\n>Simply because some old people care so much about gender norms doesn't mean that you have to care about what they do.\n\nI mean, considering the current state of politics and the bills that are being presented in the US, I absolutely have to worry. In multiple states, bills were proposed that would make it near impossible to, among other things, allow for LGBTQ presentation in the classroom. It took me a long time to realize I'm not straight or cis because I didn't have any of that being presented in a positive light until I was well into highschool. And even then, there was next to no discussion on the topic. Even though most of these haven't passed, there have been several attempts in just the past few months, and it's sickening to think that there will be children who are just like me who will feel like they have to reoress themselves even more than I did.\n\nYou may not see the relevance in the outdated opinions held by some members of our society, but I have felt them every moment of my life, even before I realized it. You complain about the term \"genderqueer\" as if it has any meaning to you at all, but if you don't aren't genderqueer, it shouldn't be anything for you to worry about. You say that myself and people like me are just trying to feel special and unique and make a demographic for ourselves, but it's kind of the only way we can hope to survive. \n\nThe little hints we can give each other, or that our allies can give us, are sometimes necessary. The title of \"genderqueer\" may seem nonsensical to you, but it makes sense to us, and that's what matters. Not your opinion, not the opinions of the dusty legislators, but whether we feel like the community we've carved out makes sense to *us*",

Nobody is stopping you from calling yourself that nor is anyone else. But, again, you cannot force others to accept that view of the world as their default. You keep talking about a mark, yet I am not even convinced there is one at the bottom of all of that. That's because there isn't any way to exactly define what \"genderqueer\" or any of the other non-binary genders actually mean, because they are not based on any real property. If it is all entirely in the mind, then it doesn't exist.\n\nThe thing you are talking about I assume is the so-called \"don't say gay\" bill, only really says that teachers have to inform parents of any such topics being brought up in the classroom. And you know, I agree with it, especially at the grade school level. Children need stability in their lives, and all these ideologies do is introduce more ambiguity. The whole gender conversation relies on the understanding of concepts way beyond kids that age should be talking about. I don't mean that they should be told that gay people don't exist. I don't think that a conversation that was sparked by the kids in the first place should be silenced either. But don't bring in the topic if it has nothing to do with what the kids themselves are bringing up, unless it is of course the normal academic subjects like grammar, science or math.",

I agree that pronouns can be cumbersome in in-person contexts and reserve my right to mess them up when I see women-presenting people who have visual features/qualities I recognize as male\u2014though I will apologize as it's not on purpose\u2014I'm just 30 and there's a lot of subconscious programming to work through for a facet of communication I don't invest a lot of conscious effort in...

Dude, gender goes back to the start of human society. The origin of a word does not equal the origin of a concept, how you don't understand that is beyond me. And trans people have existed for thousands of years as well, and were accepted into many societies with specific roles. Gay and trans people were often given roles of medicine men and women and spiritual leaders because they had a unique view on the world that we used to assume was because they were two souls inhabiting one body. If you're going to argue about topics like gender, at least know your stuff. It's obvious you've done no individual research into these topics outside of what people have told you to think based on their own biased viewpoints. So for once in your life think for yourself and stop following others.",

You ask at the beginning of the conversation to make sure you\u2019re not misgendering the person you\u2019re talking to. But yeah, only people who care about neopronouns ask pronouns because if you ask pronouns it means you will respect their answer. If you won\u2019t respect their answer, you don\u2019t ask in the first place. \u201cNormal looking\u201d people can still identify their pronoun usage. And yeah normalize cis and cis-presenting people announcing their pronouns so that trans and non binary people aren\u2019t constantly required to other themselves by asking you to respect their pronouns",

Added to estimates that range from $10,000 to upwards of $200,000 for complete transitional surgeries and you\u2019re looking at a business that\u2019s revenue runs in the 100s of millions. Sure diabetes overall is a much bigger business, but not only is that completely irrelevant it\u2019s also a problem that exists in reality, not just inside people\u2019s minds.

Whatever definition you are using was made up in the last 5 to 10 years, to suit your specific and insane agenda. The definition I am showing you has been the definition of the word since people first used it, including its Latin roots. \n\nSo when you tell me \u201cthat\u2019s not what gender means,\u201d just know that your definition of \u201cwhat gender means\u201d, is some made up bullshit from the last 5 to 10 years. My definition is the actual definition, and has been the definition since the word was first uttered.\n\nNow, if you want to learn about biology, I refer back to my first comment.

Plus I thought of this was a good idea in grade school, before it was cooool. And really, if people can invent infinite custom pronouns then they\u2019re not really pronouns anymore, they\u2019re more like proper nouns then right? Riiiiight? I get why transgender or non-binary people wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable being by referred to improperly (like being called a he because they look male while they identify as female could be upsetting, so fair enough), but making a single singular pronoun for everyone would fix that in English. Now on the other hand, the Romance languages are gonna trigger some people lol they\u2019d need total reform, it\u2019d be impossible (hence why essentially no Hispanic/Latino/Latina people identify as Latinx lol and I\u2019m sure the fact that in mixed gender situations the word Latino is used over Latina will trigger some folks, but not as much as the fact that this rule applies to every gender specific word in Romance languages basically, the male -o form is differed to, well in Spanish at least so I\u2019m assuming the same for Italian and Portuguese and likely for French and Romanian though I\u2019m less confident due to my narrower understanding, especially of Romanian). English is actually fairly progressive in that our nouns aren\u2019t gendered, other than some loan words from French and Latin/other languages I suppose, but even then it\u2019s not a gender thing since there aren\u2019t really any alternative gender specific versions of any native non-loan words except the he/she/his/her(s)/him pronouns. I can see why they developed them to ensure a better degree of context implies specificity and to avoid ambiguity in situations involving multiple people of both genders, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be too confusing in lost contexts if they just dropped the gendering and made a new singular genderless replacement would it? I mean hell we could even just use they/their/theirs/them for singular and plural as we often do anyway but it seems it\u2019d be less ambiguous to have a singular filer version, but either case would be better than having literally infinite pronouns (which again would make them essentially proper nouns and defeat the whole purpose of pronouns existing lol).",
