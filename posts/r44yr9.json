Crypto is just made up. It isn't backed by anything.

Having your money in an index fund is guaranteed to make you money in the long run, assuming that there isn't a total market collapse and we're foraging for berries. \n\nAll correct. None of it applies to crypto. The reason the stock market always goes up is that people go to work every day, and their collective work and productivity increases the value of those companies that make up the stock market. Since we have positive economic growth, the value of the market is going up. If we had negative economic growth, the markets would go down. \n\n>The same applies to crypto if you believe that crypto as a concept is going to keep growing.\n\nNo, it does not, because all crypto is, is a shared delusion that we can all jointly agree that some fake, made up digital numbers = a genuine reservoir of value. It's not. All it takes is for people to wake up from the delusion and stop agreeing with it, and the crypto bubble bursts.\n\nIf you want to gamble on crypto, knock yourself out, but don't call it \"investing\".",
