I immediately agreed because I\u2019m afraid of anyone that white, but they didn\u2019t care. They slammed my head into the table repeatedly, demanding that I admit that the Hebrews had indeed come to America a millennium ago and that John Smith was the earthly king of God\u2019s chosen people. Boy was I surprised! Thankfully my instincts took over and I relayed the information that I had not only the power of God, but also the power of anime on my side and then scared them off with a fearsome warrior cry. Then I finished my date and that girl taught me about the beautiful Mormon tradition of soaking.

Except for halfway through she announced that she needed to use the restroom and then she came back with two quirked up thugs who threatened my life unless I joined the Mormon church. I immediately agreed because I\u2019m afraid of anyone that white, but they didn\u2019t care. They slammed my head into the table repeatedly, demanding that I admit that the Hebrews had indeed come to America a millennium ago and that John Smith was the earthly king of God\u2019s chosen people. Boy was I surprised! Thankfully my instincts took over and I relayed the information that I had not only the power of God, but also the power of anime on my side and then scared them off with a fearsome warrior cry. Then I finished my date and that girl taught me about the beautiful Mormon tradition of soaking.
