They\u2019ve probably had one too many fast food employees try to correct them when they were actually right about the price difference, and don\u2019t trust you guys anymore.

That's also why English has different words for the cut of meat and the animal (pork/pig, beef/cow, poultry/chicken). \n\nSome of that French became anglicized and integrated into English as the pronunciation changed. Some words have been anglicized in the UK, but not in America (whether or not you pronounce the H in herb). French loan-words were especially prevalent in kitchen and food terminology for some reason.\n\nBut it's been a cultural association in most English speaking places since then, that French sounding words sound higher-class, because at one time that was literally the case, and I think that people still sense it even if they don't know it. Is leaning into that being pretentious? Sometimes, sure. But I think sometimes it's just how English works as a language. Is it pretentious when done with Italian in music terminology?",

Even in modern English, it shows as we call a live pig a pig, which is from the saxon language of the peasantry who bred the animal, and the meat is \u201cpork\u201d which comes from the French language of those who would afford the meat. Over time French has retained its \u201csophisticated\u201d associations and obviously with French service being the gold standard of service in the UK as opposed to, say, Russian service, it makes sense that we use a lot of French words in reference to cuisine.",

Next time you drive by an industrial district, look for the \"will call\" signs. Like when i pick up wheels from my supplier, i go to the back of their building, knock on the door that says \"will call\", some dude opens the door, sees me and says \"5 minutes\". Next thing I know, a forklift comes out with my pallet of wheels. I was born and raised in the B2B world, so it was absolutely nuts to find out other people had no clue what i was talking about. \n\nMy business is SORT OF B2B. I don't sell to Disney directly, rather, i sell to individuals who want to be hired by Disney.

Yes, this specific instance.\n\nPoint 2: Many individuals who work in restaurants have stated that this exact scenario has happened in their experience.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify. The specific argument made by the commenter we reference is that the language reported is an \u201coverly dramatic pearl clutch\u201d and thus that the specific incident didn\u2019t happen.\n\nI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true or not. I wasn\u2019t there. But I have no strong stake in that particular happenstance. Let\u2019s say that it didn\u2019t happen, and this really was a Dumb and Dumber inspired joke. I\u2019m willing to let go of point 1.\n\nBut I\u2019m unwilling to let go of point 2.",

Months later, I ordered something similar and this time, the \u201cfarmer\u2019s cheese\u201d was orange, sharp and hard (like cheddar). Turns out \u201cfarmer\u2019s cheese is whatever the farmer brings in and varies day to day and pub to pub!",

It was excellent, like a better quality boursin.  The other was listed as an ingredient in pre-packaged blintzes.  It was almost a dry cottage cheese.  Not the most flavorful, but not bad.  I always thought 'farmer's cheese' was a vague term that mostly meant minimally processed and not pressed or aged.",
