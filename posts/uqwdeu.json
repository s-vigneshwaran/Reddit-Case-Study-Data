However, the details of Jobs\u2019 diagnosis and specific treatments received, both conventional and unconventional, have not been made public. **Therefore, we cannot comment on whether or not he made the best decisions on his cancer treatment, nor can we comment on whether he would have had different outcomes had he chosen a different treatment approach. It is unknown whether Jobs\u2019 outcomes would have been different if he had pursued surgery at the time of his diagnosis, or if had followed a specific chemotherapy protocol**.\"  \n\n\nFrom the same article.",

I will say that there's nothing conclusively stating that the 9 months between diagnosis and when real treatment started was responsible for his death, or that more prompt treatment would've saved his life, but there's a lot of speculation that had Job's had the surgery when his pancreatic tumor was first detected, it wouldn't have metastasized and eventually killed him, as the form of pancreatic cancer he had was one that's generally slow-moving and moderately curable with prompt surgical intervention\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2011/10/24/steve-jobs-cancer-treatment-regrets/?sh=30637da87d2e\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4924574/#:~:text=Jobs%20was%20diagnosed%20with%20a,often%20rapidly%20fatal%20pancreatic%20adenocarcinoma.\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/cancer/pancreatic-cancer/news/20110825/faq-steve-jobs-pancreatic-cancer",

You can pay for your care costs out of pocket  (and actually get a couple percent points back in credit card rewards if you pay off the costs entirely as soon as they're billed). Then you let the HSA contributions grow at compound interest like you describe with your bitcoin idea. You pay yourself back for your medical expenses many years later, but now you've earned decades of interest on that, say $500 bill. So you are in essence giving yourself a 0% loan to go invest. You get your money back eventually but your HSA identity has now invested and reinvested that interest many times.  \n\nI'd put it in an index fund rather than volatile bitcoin, since the latter's YOY-growth is unlikely to continue through the decades.",

An overregulation that makes things \"safe\" is the same that prevents user from deciding by themselves what they want or not.\n\nThis means that if a medication is forbidden, for example, and I am in a very particular situation, I could die or shorten my life until it is approved. \n\nThis just scratches the surface. Regulations can be quite evil. It is good to have good intentions by promoting safety, but not to treat us like silly stupid people that cannot take decisions. \n\nWhat should be punished is lack of information and fraud against users/consumers. The level of quality, each one is free to choose whatever as long as they do not hurt the rest. Yet what we have, and not only in health care, is pro-monopolization and collusion via regulations. \n\nTo put a very stupid (but real) example from my country, to open a university you need a minimum of 8 degrees I recall. Who has access to that? That puts the state and a few players in an oligopolistic position, since almost noone has a budget to create such a thing. If I want to create a university in my city only for the degree I studied and make the best one around, I just cannot. People lose freedom of choice because of this kind of things... very bad. \n\nThere are some people behind the curtains systematically parasiting societies (and taking their part, of course) and some people, on top of that, clapping as they do it.",

But lets continue and say that 3 months later(in April), you get into another car accident! No matter how much your bills are, because you've hit that $10,000 deductible limit, your insurance will cover the rest of your hospital bills.\n\nOP said this all occurred over 5 months, so thats why I'm trying to figure out if their deductible was some ridiculous amount(like $250,000) which would drain all their funds in such a short amount of time.",

I have to go in and get MRIs every half year/year now just to monitor its growth in case it comes back, and probably will for the rest of my life. I was 'lucky' that the growth I have is benign, but it's still weird knowing it was there and being able to see the quantifiable changes in behavior once it was resected.

So then they sent it to another team to do additional testing, and one of the teams along that chain had the charge. The charge came after a full diagnosis and resection (two actually because it was so large they couldn't safely get it all in one surgery), and at that point we were just kind of done with it. The diagnosis was for a 6cm growth in the frontal lobe. At first they thought it was a Stage 3 and that I had a month to live due to the size. A month of no contact later they came back and assured us it was only a Stage 1 it only had to be removed. Apparently, if the diagnosis was accurate, I had an extremely rare form of brain cancer known as Central Neurocytoma which makes up roughly 0.1% of all brain tumors which is probably why it ended up being sent to so many teams. Wikipedia used to say there have only been roughly 100 diagnosed cases, but when I went to verify, that's been removed so may have been inaccurate.\n\nAt that point, we were done with the whole thing and just paid. It's been years now, so we're fine with it, and don't really want to revisit.",

Even if that just confirms that, yeah, it is your bill, then it'll delay the clock on further action until it's sorted. You can also request an itemized bill, which takes a week or two.\n\nAlso frequently the \"debt collector\" is either owned or exclusively contracted by the provider/hospital so it might just be a scare tactic. You should still figure it out, don't ignore it, but you don't have to panic and pay the whole thing off immediately to avoid it hitting your credit.",

A gentleman called in and asked about dental implants, out of pocket expenses, need for an aid/nurse, etc. The rep said \"the plan he's on does cover 85% of dental implants.\"\n\nGuy had 12 implants. The claim was denied. Why? No prior auth. It wasn't deemed medical necessity - he had dentures. The facility, not the doctor, was out of network. He saved for a year and got hit w a near $25k bill. His appeal was from his psychologist - he had separated from his wife and told his doctor he was thinking of killing himself rather than saddle his family w $25k of debt.\n\nI recently fractured my elbow. I did my due diligence to the Nth degree. I was advised to go see a certain doctor at a certain hospital. it was covered and even received a discount! I just got a bill, I'm $1500 in the hole. Not super egregious, but it may take me close to a year to pay it off - as well as making payment arrangements w my other bills/utilities to pay the bills off in a month vs right away. I'm already falling behind.",

We exhaustively checked before conducting the biopsy, however once it was resected, the tumor was a very rare type, around 0.1% of all brain tumors, so the hospital kept getting false negatives and couldn't identify it, so they then sent it to another hospital to attempt diagnosing it, who then sent it to another. This was done largely beyond our control and we didn't even know it had been sent around to so many locations until after we started questioning why the bill was from a facility halfway across the state when I had never left my home city. Insurance was willing to pay for it (if I remember correctly) but had never been told and since it had faulted, it gained interest or somehow went over the limit so we had to pick up the slack that had gone over.\n\nI may be misremembering some parts though. This was several years ago, with the bill coming roughly a year or so after the final resection neurosurgery. At that point we were just done with the ordeal and just paid to make it go away.",

Furthermore, the problem wasn't really the deductible, but all the costs that weren't covered. The treatment her insurance deemed \"experimental\" even though it had been the preferred treatment for years with great success for his condition. All the out-of-network balance billing, even though he was at an in network hospital and his primary caregivers were in network. \n\nAnd the only way she could have gotten better coverage would have been to forgo almost $11,000 years in employer compensation, and buy an even more expensive plan--which could have still had the same issues. \n\n>maybe you should have 15k tucked away just in case you need that. \n\nAh, yes... she should have had $15K tucked away. Aside from the fact that won't do much to cover six figures in medical bills, how was she supposed to do that? Not go to law school so she wouldn't have student debt? Have been psychic and known her (now ex) husband was going to go crazy and try and kill her, and in up in prison for life sticking her with his college debt as well? \n\n>There are HSAs where you put money in and its not taxed. Its like an IRA for healthcare.\n\nYou can only have an HSA with a high deductible healthcare plan, something which you previously faulted her for having (even though she doesn't) and isn't even offered through her employer. If she had had one, it would have certainly led to her being even more in debt currently. \n\n>America pays the lowest taxes out of any of the countries you mentioned.\n\nWith government in the US covering [65.0% of all health care](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302997) costs ([$11,539 as of 2019](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/highlights.pdf)) that's $7,500 per person per year in taxes towards health care. The next closest is Norway at [$5,673](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm). The UK is $3,620. Canada is $3,815. Australia is $3,919. That means over a lifetime Americans are paying a minimum of $143,794 more in taxes compared to any other country towards health care. \n\nSo, again... you've done a great job showing you're an ignorant jackass, but you haven't shown a single better decision my girlfriend could have made. Would you like to try again?",

The only real moral or ethical failing belongs to those responsible for the system - the people getting these paper divorces are just doing what they have to in order to have medical care and the other necessities of life. and that is something that any moral or ethical society should be providing them *without* being forced to violate their own dignity in this way.  \n\nIf you're ever in this kind of situation with a spouse, call up a certified financial planner or a T&E lawyer. They're the only ones who know all the arcane details necessary to do it legally and effectively. And if you've got a disabled kid or spouse, you should talk to a T&E lawyer about a Special Needs Trust for them, too; that's a special kind of Trust just to provide for all the needs that disability payments are completely insufficient to cover.",

The World Overcomers. They made the news around that time because they erected a replica Statue of Liberty in front of their church, except instead of a torch she was holding a cross. Super tacky. \n\nAnyway, one of the jobs we did for them were these kind of recruitment booklets. Among the many wtf things in there the one I mostly remember is a section basically saying to disown anyone you know, family or otherwise, if they get a disease such as cancer. The reasoning was that the disease was just the sin manifesting in you, that by getting it it was proof that you weren't sufficiently following God. Crazy stuff.",

Other than those defined services, they can choose to limit their coverage or put annual or lifetime limits on their spending. They can also do this for specific treatments. Say you need a bone marrow transplant. It\u2019s not under the defined \u201cessential health benefits\u201d, so they can set a cap on what they will cover in regards to that, if anything. \n\nInsurance companies can and will refuse to cover things, even medically necessary things, if they can get away with it. \n\nThe wife can\u2019t work with severe cancer and treatment, most likely. So they are missing her income on top of all these possible extra expenses.\n\nWe don\u2019t know when this happened. Insurance companies prior to the ACA could set annual and lifetime limits for ANYTHING and refuse to pay after that was reached. \n\nIt\u2019s willfully ignorant to pretend that insured people cannot go into huge medical debt.",

I have also had the displeasure of fighting with insurance companies for my grandmother before she got Medicare. \n\nYou are ignoring the fact that the insurance company is the one deciding what the \u201ctreatment of choice\u201d is. They can and will ignore what the doctor is saying and make their own decisions. You want to pretend that insurance companies actual go by statistical evidence, when they don\u2019t. They go by what\u2019s the cheapest thing they can kinda justify despite what the medical professionals are saying is needed. A common example is them saying that a certain drug is needed when the doctor says that it\u2019s contraindicated and wants to try something that\u2019s typically a second choice drug. I had this problem with my asthma meds with My last insurance. They have a 400 a month drug that they refused to cover as \u201cunnecessary \u201c when the drug they would cover was ineffective for me. This is not an isolated incident. This happens to a LOT of people. \n\nIt\u2019s a systemwide issue with the bone transplants by the way, to the point medical professionals are advocating to get it listed as a required covered benefit because, unlike your pie in the sky shit, insurance companies are doing everything in their power to make sure that expensive treatments are not covered.\n\nEdit: you also completely ignored that insurance companies can, in many cases, set a maximum for the amount they will cover, annually and/or lifetime. They are legally barred from doing this for some services, but it\u2019s legal for many others. Including some cancer treatments.",

If for no other reason, you can rest assured that if an insurance company did not cover a medically necessary therapy and let someone go without care or even die, they would get sued to hell and back.\n\nIn my side of healthcare, there has not been one single time in 10+ years where an insurance company did not cover a therapy that was medically necessary. \n\nYes, plenty of times they did not cover expense therapies when there were cheaper alternatives that had equal health outcomes. And I think this last statement is where insurance gets it's bad reputation. But would it make sense for your premiums to be x5 higher to pay for someone's therapy when there was a cheaper alternative? Would you want to pay x5 your premium for this situation?",

I will try to keep up and put it plainly into this thread.\n\nTreatment of choice - This is evidenced based, peer reviewed. In Western Medicine, this is what we follow. Insurance companies cover this. If they didn't, here would be law suits and people dying.\n\nSecondary treatments - Also evidenced based, peer reviewed. Insurances generally cover this with an authorization explaining why you cannot use the treatment of choice. This would be the case in your Singulair/Advair example.\n\nClarification on why your example is bad and medical treatment/billing is complex. Advair or other ICS+LABA, although more expensive, are preferred per the guidelines and covered by insurance. If insurance does not cover strictly cover Advair, they will cover Dulera/Breo/Symbicort which are equivalent therapeutically. Singular, on the other hand, is a secondary treatment. If it were also expensive, they would require an authorization explaining why you cannot take the (also expensive) treatment of choice. Since it is not expensive, they cover it anyway.\n\nContinuing on the asthma - If a physician wants to write for Xolair first line for asthma, they are going against guidelines and it won't be covered without authorization. Why is it not covered without auth? Because (1) it's not FDA approved to be used first line, (2) it's only used in specific types of asthma and only as add on therapy, (3) it's expensive.\n\nYour argument is that insurance should cover Xolair because the doctor wrote it and the doctor knows best. Well, any respectable doctor would agree the physician writing Xolair first line is incorrect without more testing. Have more testing/diagnosis? Great! Submit it to the insurance and if it's medically sound, it's covered!\n\nFrom the patient side, would you want to pay x5 higher in premiums to cover Xolair for this person who could have used a cheaper therapy? I don't. Yes, absolutely cover it if there is an indication for it and they've failed other treatments.\n\nInsurance not being healthcare professionals - lol. I think you need to research this a little bit. Look up MUEs, DURs, etc. The people who are in these boards are absolutely healthcare professionals. In the case of medications, these boards with the insurance companies are made up of physicians, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals.\n\nAre there crooked people in healthcare? Yes. Are there crooked people in other fields of work? Yes. Are there more crooked people in healthcare than other fields of work? I would say no.\n\nAgain, I'm sorry you're angry. It's frustrating. I've spent way too much time trying to explain this but I hope this gives you peace. If you want to talk about it further, please reply or DM. I will have some time in roughly 20 hours to respond.\n\nThanks for coming to my TED talk.",

You can be born in America and not say stupid shit, it's just that *a disproportion amount of Americans say stupid shit.* Just like how you can use Reddit and not say stupid shit, it's just that *a disproportionate amount of Redditors say stupid shit.* Both subreddits are just making fun of people for spouting dumb circlejerky bullshit, like Americans calling everything they disagree with communism and Redditors hijacking every thread to jerk about \"America bad.\" r/averageredditor is exactly as much of an \"open hate subreddit\" as r/ShitAmericansSay, which is to say that neither of them are hate subs lol.\n\nr/averageredditor also happens to have comment sections devolve into racist/sexist/etc circlejerks disproportionately frequently, which is why people call the sub trash.",

          "text": "> Like how much is medical insurance in America?\n\nThe average annual premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance in 2021 were $7,739  for single coverage and $22,221 for family coverage. Most covered workers make a contribution toward the cost of the premium for their coverage. On average, covered workers contribute 17% of the premium for single coverage ($1,316) and 28% of the premium for family coverage ($6,222). \n\nhttps://files.kff.org/attachment/Report-Employer-Health-Benefits-2021-Annual-Survey.pdf\n\nGiven that you might thing we get a break on taxes, but sadly not. \n\nWith government in the US covering [65.0% of all health care](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302997) costs ([$11,539 as of 2019](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/highlights.pdf)) that's $7,500 per person per year in taxes towards health care. The next closest is Norway at [$5,673](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm). The UK is $3,620. Canada is $3,815. Australia is $3,919. That means over a lifetime Americans are paying a minimum of $143,794 more in taxes compared to any other country towards health care. Note some of those taxes do at least go to subsidize the private plans above.",

However, they are picky about coverage, so the essentials like ER, regular visits, checkups, medically necessary procedures, etc. are free. But if you want more elective treatments like acne meds, massage therapy, or so, then medicaid might not cover much, if at all. I think the coverage varies by state as well and I recall hearing that Washington's Apple Health (WA Medicaid) is very good.\n\nWhen I worked for a local business full-time, because they were small, they couldn't bargain a good deal for their employees regarding benefits, so I had an extremely high deductible and premium with limited coverage. \n\nThen, I started working in the school system, which flipped everything around and I got extremely low deductibles/premiums. Co-pays weren't too bad. $20 for office visits, $150 for ER and around $10 for prescriptions and I had a lot of coverage. I still work in the school system, so I'm lucky to still have access to good healthcare.\n\nI've never experienced Obamacare, so I feel like I can't really say much about it. Though, my dad works as a rural public hospital administrator and saw an increase in patients, which was a win-win, since it helped more people but also helped the hospital stay open.",

Not only that, \u201censuring health-care access for all Americans would save more than 68,000 lives.\u201d\nIn their breakdown of the numbers, researchers applied the existing Medicare fee structure across the entire health-care system and found it would save about $100 billion annually. Keep in mind that this basically represents less money going to doctors and hospitals, a major sticking point for medical groups that oppose Medicare-for-all. But those declines would be more than offset by several hundred billions in savings from reduced administrative and billing costs, Galvani and her colleagues estimate. The lack of patient billing under a Medicare-for-all system would also eliminate the roughly $35 billion a year that hospitals now pay to chase down unpaid bills.\n\nSource: https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/02/20/lancet-medicare-for-all-study/",

It limited the number of representatives in the House to 435 based on the population numbers from the 1910 census. The issue this creates is that each state has to have at least 1 representative, and there are only so many to give out. That means Wyoming with 576,000 people has one representative. California with 39.35 million has 53, and is actually losing a seat. That will mean one representative for every 756,000 people. That gives the people in Wyoming 30% more representation in the House than California. \n\nThis also plays into the presidential election, since the electoral college assigns votes by number of senators plus number of representatives. So next presidential election Wyoming gets 3, California will get 54. The vote of people in Wyoming has over 3x the weight of someone living in California in the electoral college. There are even bigger gaps with other states since some are close to earning an extra representative but don't quite make it. (And if they earn one, that means somewhere else loses theirs)",

If your goal is \"maintain power by any means necessary\", then doing this makes perfect sense.\n\nAnyway, I thought my explanations were pretty self-explanatory, but I'll assume you're commenting in good faith and go deeper.\n\n**Presidential election** \\- The allocation of electoral votes benefits Republicans because less populous states generally have more electoral votes proportional to their populations than more populated states. For example, in 2020 Wyoming had 3 electoral votes and a population of 581,000 (193,000 people per vote), whereas California had 55 electoral votes with a population of 39.5 million (718,181 people per vote), giving each person in Wyoming over 3 times as much voting power as each person in California. Spread this across the entire nation and we see what happened in 2016 (Trump wins with 3 million fewer votes) and what almost happened in 2020 (a \"close\" election in which Biden wins by 7 million votes).\n\n**House** \\- Gerrymandered districts use \"packing and cracking\" to dilute the voting power of the opposite party. For example, let's say you have 100 voters and 60 of them wants Democrats and 40 of them want Republicans, and it's your job to divide this population into five districts. Fairness would result in 3 Democrats and 2 Republicans in your House, but you want Republicans to win, so you divide the districts in a very specific way. First, you make two of your districts = 100% Democrats (\"Packing\"), so we have two districts of 20 Democratic voters each. Next, you divide the rest of the 20 Democrats evenly across the rest of your districts (\"Cracking\"), so you have the following breakdown:\n\n1. 20 Democrats\n2. 20 Democrats\n3. 6 Democrats + 14 Republicans\n4. 7 Democrats + 13 Republicans\n5. 7 Democrats + 13 Republicans\n\nNow the result of your election is 3 Republican House seats and 2 Democrat House seats, despite more voters wanting Democrats.\n\n**Senate** \\- This one is similar to the electoral college. Since lower population states get the same 2 votes that higher population states get in the senate, lower population states get far more power per voter. Let's look at California and Wyoming again - in 2018, 6 million people voted for the Democratic winner in California and 136,000 people voted for the Republican winner in Wyoming, yet those two senators have equal voting power in the senate. The makeup of the senate might be very close, or even not very close in favor of the republicans, but when you compare the popular votes that put the candidates there, Democratic votes blow Republican votes out of the water.",

So a state with 200, 000 people would have as many votes in the senate (or simply senators) as a state with 2 Million. I was done (I assume) so the more populous states don't completely dominate the senate. E.g. vote for a bill that causes a wealth transfer from the smaller states to the larger states. That way, each state is an equal member in the federation.   \n\n\nThere are other things as well like gerrymandering and voter suppression as well.

They know the vibe is very \"eat the rich\" in this country, so they're trying to justify their refusal to make things better by saying \"but the rich would get free stuff too, and you fellow kids wouldn't like that, would you?

I think that is the way to go until health care gets comparatevely as cheap as food. Same for education. These are usually state monopolies or overregulated areas. And that does affect prices, making it less affordable. If you want something free but the cost is high you will eventually go bankrupt anyway so that is not a good solution altogether.",

And other difficulties. \n\n25k is a lot to save, but even 60k take home is 5k per month.. Less than half of that can achieve a few million in retirement at 7% compound interest.\n\nMy point was just that 10 lifetimes is a farce for sure, and it's far from impossible. Being above average in the right country and being a little lucky an MD could save significantly more.\n\nCompensation vs the US is not as atrocious as the previous poster was implying in all universal healthcare countries.

American hospitals will happily take people in, charge their insurance through the gills, and then stick people in medical debt afterwards. This is a lot harder to get mad about than if hospitals were actively barring their doors to the poor. The care is there, it's just that in America a lot of effort goes into convincing people that it's their choice to get it or not.",

Yes, everything can always be better, but at the prices we\u2019re paying it should be damn near perfect and it\u2019s very very far from it. \n\nHere is what happened to my wife: \n\nYou\u2019ve got something going on, let\u2019s say memory issues and balance problems. You see your PCP and if they can throw pills at you they just blow you off. A few months later the entire right side of your body goes numb so you go to the ER, you see a neurologist and they tell you you had a mini stroke and admit you for more tests. You do a bunch of tests and don\u2019t hear anything and then Friday morning you wake up and can\u2019t get out of bed. They think it might be MS but you passed the test they do for that. Then it\u2019s the weekend and a new neurologist you\u2019ve never met before comes in, he tells you that there\u2019s no such thing as a mini stroke and that you have MS and you\u2019re being sent home and to follow up with the first neurologist you saw. You get to take home this supercool walker you\u2019ve been using. You go home and call that neurologist and it\u2019ll be 3 months before you can get an appointment. This is your life now. Can you still do your job and keep your insurance or are you going on Medicare? Hope you\u2019ve got money saved up, each year you have to pay $3k out of pocket before Medicare starts paying. Oh, and your neurologist doesn\u2019t take Medicare. \n\nSorry that was so long but I had trouble deciding where to end my story because that\u2019s just how it goes forever. Your new full time job is being sick and going to appointments and you better hope for good luck keeping track of it all since your initial symptom was memory issues.",

A 31% higher disease adjusted life years average. Higher rates of medical and lab errors. A lower rate of being able to make a same or next day appointment with their doctor than average. \n\nhttps://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/#item-percent-used-emergency-department-for-condition-that-could-have-been-treated-by-a-regular-doctor-2016\n\n52nd in the world in doctors per capita. \n\nhttps://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Health/Physicians/Per-1,000-people\n\nHigher infant mortality levels. Yes, even when you adjust for differences in methodology. \n\nhttps://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/infant-mortality-u-s-compare-countries/\n\nFewer acute care beds. A lower number of psychiatrists. Etc.\n\nhttps://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-health-care-resources-compare-countries/#item-availability-medical-technology-not-always-equate-higher-utilization\n\n[Comparing Health Outcomes of Privileged US Citizens With Those of Average Residents of Other Developed Countries](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2774561)\n\n>These findings imply that even if all US citizens experienced the same health outcomes enjoyed by privileged White US citizens, US health indicators would still lag behind those in many other countries.\n\nWhen asked about their healthcare system as a whole the US system ranked dead last of 11 countries, with only 19.5% of people saying the system works relatively well and only needs minor changes. The average in the other countries is 46.9% saying the same. Canada ranked 9th with 34.5% saying the system works relatively well. The UK ranks fifth, with 44.5%. Australia ranked 6th at 44.4%. The best was Germany at 59.8%.\n\nOn rating the overall quality of care in the US, Americans again ranked dead last, with only 25.6% ranking it excellent or very good. The average was 50.8%. Canada ranked 9th with 45.1%. The UK ranked 2nd, at 63.4%. Australia was 3rd at 59.4%. The best was Switzerland at 65.5%.\n\nhttps://www.cihi.ca/en/commonwealth-fund-survey-2016\n\nThe US has 43 hospitals in the top 200 globally; one for every 7,633,477 people in the US. That's good enough for a ranking of 20th on the list of top 200 hospitals per capita, and significantly lower than the average of one for every 3,830,114 for other countries in the top 25 on spending with populations above 5 million. The best is Switzerland at one for every 1.2 million people. In fact the US only beats one country on this list; the UK at one for every 9.5 million people.\n\nIf you want to do the full list of 2,000 instead it's 334, or one for every 982,753 people; good enough for 21st. Again far below the average in peer countries of 527,236. The best is Austria, at one for every 306,106 people.\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/best-hospitals-2021\n\n#[OECD Countries Health Care Spending and Rankings](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm)\n\n|Country|Govt. / Mandatory (PPP)|Voluntary (PPP)|Total (PPP)|%&nbsp;GDP|[Lancet HAQ Ranking](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\\(18\\)30994-2/fulltext)|[WHO Ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000)|[Prosperity Ranking](https://www.prosperity.com/rankings)|[CEO&nbsp;World Ranking](https://ceoworld.biz/2019/08/05/revealed-countries-with-the-best-health-care-systems-2019/)|[Commonwealth Fund Ranking](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror-wall-2014-update-how-us-health-care-system?redirect_source=/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror)\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n1.&nbsp;United&nbsp;States|[$7,274](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302997) |$3,798 |$11,072 |16.90%|29|37|59|30|11\n2.

Just the other day I went to the dentist for a crown. They said I owed them $540. I said, \"That seems really high considering my insurance...\" and they go, \"Oh, our mistake, we inputted in the wrong insurance for you. You owe us $136.\" \n\nShe was confused why I was upset. Had I not questioned it, I'd have paid an extra $404 and no one would have ever corrected it. \n\nIf you go anywhere to get health care and asked them how much something costs, they look at you like you're some kind of weirdo. \"Oh, I'm sure your insurance will take care of most of it anyway.\" Instead, I'm like, \"No, I'm price shopping. If you guys aren't going to compete by having price transparency I'll take my business elsewhere.\"\n\nEvery generation before us got to complacent with their cheap prices on everything. We need to demand more from our systems, more from our shitty politicians, and more from our local governments.",

You don't have any control over what out of network providers may be on duty at your in network hospital on any given day, and treatment can be time sensitive. Most people don't even realize until long after. \n\nNot to mention other categories of expenses, like my girlfriend's insurance deciding the course of treatment recommended by her son's doctors (and used to great effect for years) was \"experimental\" and thus not covered. \n\nNot to mention things like lost wages and other indirect costs. \n\n42% of cancer patients go through their entire life's savings within two years, with an average hit to their net worth of nearly $100,000. \n\nhttps://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/cancer-forces-42-of-patients-to-exhaust-life-savings-in-2-years-study-finds.html",

They ran blood tests, did ultrasounds, had doctors come and examine, was given pain medication and ultimately walked out with some instructions for her GP and more medication to keep her going.\n\n$0. Nothing. My mum a few years ago went in for gangrenous appendix. Spent a week in a ward, had a professor of surgery (higher than doctorate) operate on her, a litany of medication and scans. $0. Walk out at the end.\n\nDo we pay higher taxes here? Yes. But we save more money on having social infrastructure. It's the same thing as insurance but doesn't waste money on corporate salaries, share holders or time spent fighting claims.\n\nI can not fathom why Americans refuse to look at a country like Australia, which is still run by conservatives and wholy free market, but has healthcare, and think... yes. That is actually much better.",

In the person's post-history he claimed to be Canadian teenager at one point. Then he claimed to be a German. Every story the person ever posted about had one thing in common though, he'd bash the US with very vivid examples of how \"third world\" the US is and call people fascists for disagreeing with him.\n\nReddit is so fucking myopic in its need for propaganda that you people constantly recycle this over and over again even though it's a lie.",

Yah, it was enough to force me into bankruptcy.\n\nAnyways, just thought I'd share my story since everyone says this guy's story in the OP is fake.",

With my student loans too, there is no hope for us to ever be ahead.

Once you pay that much in a year for medical expenses, insurance covers everything else. The maximum family out-of-pocket limit for the marketplace (Obamacare) is $17,400, federally mandated. Which is a lot of money. But that's the maximum, most policies are less, and even that large sum would not wipe out the savings described here.\n\nYes there are undoubtedly products that pretend to be insurance that don't have these maximums, and some that don't cover pre-existing conditions. But those are rip-offs and cannot be sold on the marketplace or provided by employers - they don't meet the basic requirements of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDo I like the the way this countries' health care system works? No, it absolutely sucks. But whatever the author's story is, the above is not the whole story.\n\nSource: My wife had leukemia and required a bone marrow transplant at the Mayo Clinic.

My girlfriend has over $100,000 in medical debt from her son's leukemia, after what her \"good\" insurance covered. She got nailed with care deemed \"experimental\" by her insurance; balance billing; out of network providers (at an in-network facility); all practically unavoidable. \n\nThen, if you read the actual explanation by the people above, you'll see that much of the financial hit was from lost wages and other related factors. None of this is unusual. 42% of cancer victims go through their entire life savings within two years of their diagnosis, with an average hit to their net worth of nearly $100,000. \n\nhttps://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/cancer-forces-42-of-patients-to-exhaust-life-savings-in-2-years-study-finds.html",

My wife hasn't worked since her diagnosis 5 years ago, and I've missed significant time too. So we've lost a lot more than 100k in income/net worth.

It should be, but alas a certain party (republicans) feel it\u2019s too much like Europe of which paying for healthcare is the difference. They only care about money and making it no matter the cost. I\u2019ve seen people before Obamacare who died because they couldn\u2019t afford the treatment. So they were made comfortable while dying. Those treatments are very expensive. Had I known you I would have told you to pull a Trump and not pay. If you have kids and trust them, give them all of your money and go bankrupt. Or give it to someone you trust where you can access it. You can\u2019t get blood from a turnip is totally true and you can\u2019t go to prison over owing money. Debtors prisons are long gone. People loose lots of money in illness in various ways, mostly theft though. There is no honor any longer and if it displayed no one cares. \n\nMy father suffered acute septic shock and lost all his limbs as a result. It was freakin horrific. Then he had his S-colon removed so he also has an ostomy bag to contain his poop. His little visit cost around 5mil and insurance paid for everything. Long story short, my bum of a sister wouldn\u2019t help my mother. My sister is a greedy POS and I will hate her as long as I live at least. She called the cops, filed a bogus report and I got in trouble for stealing. In the 8 days I was away she moved my folks out of their home, sold everything, took a lot of that and put them in a home hat was 10k/month. My father\u2019s nest egg is all gone, which was quite a bit. All of the photos and a lifetime of memories all gone. She, of course took what she wanted. She didn\u2019t get the vaccine out of fear (she\u2019s not a trump supporter but acts like one, go figure) so when she got very sick I was hoping she would buy the farm. I\u2019m serious too. I wouldn\u2019t visit nor call her. My exwife got very sick and her sister stole 600k from her while comatose. She is a massive loser with no morals whatsoever.",

And I do think surprise billing is a powerful argument for the people who want healthcare socialized 100%, since the people who want the status quo are doing f*** all to address the issue.\n\nI do think there could be clever, innovative ways to remove the problem of surprise billing from our current system without losing the free market incentives for all parties to control costs that we would lose if we socialized it all.

But we don't see the kinds of problems with universal healthcare systems around the world that we do with the US. In fact we don't see as many problems with Medicare as we do with private insurance. \n\nAnd, as written, Medicare for All offers greater coverage than almost any of them. It's also worth noting that when private care has to compete with a strong public system, the private care is dramatically cheaper. For example supplemental family insurance in the UK runs about $2,000 per year. Private insurance runs $20,000 per year in the US.",

It could be $100,000. It could easily be $200,000. It could be more. That could easily be enough to wipe out modest life savings and home equity. \n\n>And health insurance? \n\nWhat about it?

Reason being that even a catastrophic plan - the cheapest, most barebones insurance you can get - has an out of pocket maximum around 10k. As in, no matter what you're being treated for or what costs are being incurred, you pay that 10k and then you don't pay any more, for the whole year. \n\nI don't know what 20 years of life savings looks like, but I would *hope* it's more than 10k if you're a dual income household with both earners having college degrees and no credit card debt. And that's if they had *the worst insurance plan you can get.* If you have even middling insurance, your max out of pocket is much, much lower than that.",

Within a few years I sold the house, my custom Jag and closed both retirement plans with every penny going to medical expenses. I get so angry hearing people blame another persons lack of planning or claim they are just too lazy to work when health care costs destroy the lives of fellow Americans.

The average in the other countries is 46.9% saying the same. Canada ranked 9th with 34.5% saying the system works relatively well. The UK ranks fifth, with 44.5%. Australia ranked 6th at 44.4%. The best was Germany at 59.8%.\n\nOn rating the overall quality of care in the US, Americans again ranked dead last, with only 25.6% ranking it excellent or very good. The average was 50.8%.

The best was Switzerland at 65.5%.\n\nhttps://www.cihi.ca/en/commonwealth-fund-survey-2016\n\nThe US has 43 hospitals in the top 200 globally; one for every 7,633,477 people in the US. That's good enough for a ranking of 20th on the list of top 200 hospitals per capita, and significantly lower than the average of one for every 3,830,114 for other countries in the top 25 on spending with populations above 5 million. The best is Switzerland at one for every 1.2 million people. In fact the US only beats one country on this list; the UK at one for every 9.5 million people.\n\nIf you want to do the full list of 2,000 instead it's 334, or one for every 982,753 people; good enough for 21st.

A 31% higher disease adjusted life years average. Higher rates of medical and lab errors. A lower rate of being able to make a same or next day appointment with their doctor than average. \n\nhttps://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/quality-u-s-healthcare-system-compare-countries/#item-percent-used-emergency-department-for-condition-that-could-have-been-treated-by-a-regular-doctor-2016\n\n52nd in the world in doctors per capita. \n\nhttps://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Health/Physicians/Per-1,000-people\n\nHigher infant mortality levels.

The average in the other countries is 46.9% saying the same. Canada ranked 9th with 34.5% saying the system works relatively well. The UK ranks fifth, with 44.5%. Australia ranked 6th at 44.4%. The best was Germany at 59.8%.\n\nOn rating the overall quality of care in the US, Americans again ranked dead last, with only 25.6% ranking it excellent or very good. The average was 50.8%. Canada ranked 9th with 45.1%. The UK ranked 2nd, at 63.4%. Australia was 3rd at 59.4%. The best was Switzerland at 65.5%.\n\nhttps://www.cihi.ca/en/commonwealth-fund-survey-2016\n\nThe US has 43 hospitals in the top 200 globally; one for every 7,633,477 people in the US. That's good enough for a ranking of 20th on the list of top 200 hospitals per capita, and significantly lower than the average of one for every 3,830,114 for other countries in the top 25 on spending with populations above 5 million. The best is Switzerland at one for every 1.2 million people. In fact the US only beats one country on this list; the UK at one for every 9.5 million people.\n\nIf you want to do the full list of 2,000 instead it's 334, or one for every 982,753 people; good enough for 21st. Again far below the average in peer countries of 527,236. The best is Austria, at one for every 306,106 people.\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/best-hospitals-2021\n\n#[OECD Countries Health Care Spending and Rankings](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm)\n\n|Country|Govt. / Mandatory (PPP)|Voluntary (PPP)|Total (PPP)|%&nbsp;GDP|[Lancet HAQ Ranking](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\\(18\\)30994-2/fulltext)|[WHO Ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000)|[Prosperity Ranking](https://www.prosperity.com/rankings)|[CEO&nbsp;World Ranking](https://ceoworld.biz/2019/08/05/revealed-countries-with-the-best-health-care-systems-2019/)|[Commonwealth Fund Ranking](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror-wall-2014-update-how-us-health-care-system?redirect_source=/publications/fund-reports/2014/jun/mirror-mirror)\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n1.&nbsp;United&nbsp;States|[$7,274](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302997) |$3,798 |$11,072 |16.90%|29|37|59|30|11\n2.

Now the flat repair shop forces you to pay extra because your insurance didn't pay, so you have to pay a larger amount (again to help cover the cost of those without insurance).  While it would normally be $50 to pay for the flat repair through your insurance and your insurance would pay around $200, now it is $17,000 with a discount bringing it down to only $12,000.  You need to pay in full or your wages will be garnished and it will be a huge ding on your credit report.",

What is wrong. What we want government to do and what we want personal responsibility to be. We do this at the national level. At the state level. At the local level. At the family level. Humankind has been doing it since literally the dawn of mankind. You act like it's some insurmountable problem. \n\nIn this case, considering we know public healthcare spending has a positive return on investment, it's proven to be hundreds of thousands of dollars cheaper per person over a lifetime while producing better outcomes at all our peers, generally produces better quality, we know government care in the US is already more efficient and better liked, and prevents tremendous amounts of human suffering it seems like no brainer to me.
