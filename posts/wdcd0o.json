I've seen it a million times.\n\n\nBest I can explain this to you is - written word is a form of speech. Imagine a group of people is having a discussion in real life, and half of those people, instead of speaking clearly and correctly, mumble some borderline incoherent crap. You can sort of get what they're saying, but it's a pain to listen to, you have to make an effort to actually decipher their speech, and they're not doing it because they can't speak properly - they're doing it because they can't be bothered.\n\n\nWould you want to talk to these people? No, because they're not even trying to verbalize their thoughts in a way that's convenient for the listener.\n\n\nSame with writing. If you don't make the effort to make it look reasonably civilized, why should anyone care about your opinion? You don't show any respect to others when you refuse to communicate properly, so why should anyone show respect to you by reading your half-legible drivel?\n\n\nI get that we live in an age of anti-intellectualism, and being a dumbass is a virtue. But nobody is asking you to compose Shakespearian prose in your Reddit comments. People are asking you to adhere to the absolute **fundamentals** of your language, the **basic** rules everyone should know and follow. If I can do it as a non-native speaker, you should be able to do it, too.",

It needs a passive voice for it to be grammatically correct: \"I have seen\"/\"The dog was seen\".\n\nIt all depends on the subject and object of the sentence, what you want to make important.  If you want to be the subject of the sentence, you need to use an active voice, since you are the one doing the action.  If you want to be the subject of the sentence, you need the passive voice, where the action is applied to you.\n\nFor the most part, unless you're writing prose, you want to be the subject of a sentence, unless you're trying to convey something.  \"Despite its best efforts to remain hidden, the dog was seen by me,\" implying that the subject was actively trying not be seen, but it failed at its attempt.  \"Seen\" always requires a helper verb, since it's an imperfect verb.\n\nMore over, if you have seen the dog before, it's grammatically incorrect to say, \"I have seen that dog yesterday.\"  Since \"yesterday\" is a specific period, it would be correct to say, \"I saw that dog yesterday.\"  Though, if you can't specify the time when you saw it before, it would be appropriate to say, \"I have seen that dog before.\"",

I agree that English is already more confusing than some other languages, but if you are hoping to change that, good luck to you.\n\nJRR Tolkien once said about changes like this that \"this is not just how language is changed. It is how it is made. \"\n\n\nps I understand that some common misuses can be irritating. I really dislike \"very unique\" or the most unique. Logically it is nonsense. If there is only one of any entity, it is unique. If there are any other number, two, or three, or one trillion trillion trillion, it is simply not unique, and any number other than one is equally \"not unique\" as if there are as many as all the particles in the universe. \n\nBut people, including extremely educated and articulate people, will use \"unique\" as if it meant \"unusual, or\" rare\". And so it will probably aquire that as its primary meaning. Then we will need a different word for \"strictly only one of them exists\".",

No.  Language changes, yes, but mostly by adding words, changing the spelling of words. . . the meaning of nouns, verbs and adjectives may change over time.  Prepositions, not so much.  Certain words can change with little problem, but we rely on others to construct a meaningful sentence, much like a foundation or framework.  It's why, [\"Jabberwocky\"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42916/jabberwocky) works.\n\nIs \"of\" now going to mean the same thing as \"have\"?  Are we going to start saying things like, \"I of a yellow pencil?\"\n\n\n\nYes, it's good that we can understand imperfect grammar, but we shouldn't encourage it.  Can you imagine the nonsense that could result if we adopted the language of the internet's lowest common denominator?  It's not about being a nitpicking snob.

It actually happened in Latin: the verb habere was used after the infinitive to create the future, but over time, the \"hab\"portion disappeared but left the conjugation attached to the infinitive, giving us the modern future tenses in the Romance language family. Another English example is the verb \"willan\", meaning \"to want\" becoming \"will\"or even \" 'll \", to mark the future. \n\nNo one will ever \"I of a yellow pencil\" because the context is completely different, just like how we can say \"I'm gonna visit my mom\", but we can't say \"I'm gonna the store\" .\" Have\": to own/possess is not  the same as \"have\" the perfect aspect auxillary, which is different from \"have\" the  past modal particle, which as argued in [this article](https://www.jstor.org/stable/23739744) , likely already has become \"of\"in speech, and the writing (which is more conservative than speech) simply hasn't caught up yet. \n\nAlso, \"I should of bought milk yesterday\" is perfectly understandable and clear, it just isn't formal written English. \n\nAlso, the \"lowest common denominator\" already is part of language change.

They are both versions of the same thing. Informalizing words in a way that places sound over spelling.\n\nI'm not saying we should suddenly start accepting it in school essays or professional publications but... this is Reddit. Nothing here should ever be considered anything above \"informal\". \n\nThere are basically zero rules in English. Almost everything has multiple exceptions. We borrow words and phrases from other languages wholesale without changing the spelling or the grammar, at times. It is a complicated, informal, constantly changing mishmash of nonsense and the only true rule is memorization. Our letters don't even make consistent sounds, none of this makes any sense. At least on an intellectual level. \n\nPeople decided that some things sounded best, then new people decided that \"No, these new ways sound better still!\". Then, over time, slang and colloquialisms entered common speech and were added to our lexicon. It goes on and on. One of the most common words in the world \"OK\" [entered the language as a joke](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-hilarious-history-of-ok-okay).\n\nAnyone trying to clutch English to their chest and say, \"It won't change! I won't let it!\" is on a fool's errand. You won't win that game and to expect to is either arrogant, to the point of delusion, or you were already standing in a place of madness when you started.\n\nAgain, professional English, I agree should remain fluid in an additive sense but otherwise remain normalized but informal English should be as open as it wants to be. (And it will be, despite what a few pedants on the internet think.)",

We pause, stop, emphasize, or question using a comma, a period, an exclamation point or a question mark. Correct punctuation adds clarity and precision to writing; it allows the writer to stop, pause, or give emphasis to certain parts of the sentence.\u201d\n\n[grammar rules here too](https://www.niu.edu/writingtutorial/grammar/index.shtml)\n\n[check out rule 5a and 6b](https://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/commas.asp)\n\nSo anyways, using incorrect grammar isn\u2019t the same as the English language being malleable. Using improper punctuation is also not the same thing.\n\nEdit: Added source for grammar\n\nEdit 2: Punctuation was made to mimic the spoken language.",

Given that English grammar is descriptive and not prescriptive, one can make a case that *of* being used in this manner is acceptable. Not many people today will agree with you, not even me, but more and more people will agree every day as usage spreads until eventually it will be generally acceptable. Grammar is liquid, mutable, playful. But more than that it evolves to reflect usage changes. The *of* in *should of* is becoming \u201ccorrect,\u201d whether we like it or not. Don\u2019t worry, though. We\u2019ll all be dead long before they start teaching it in schools.",

Widespread usage determines \u201ccorrectness,\u201d not the dictates of grammar primers or grade school teachers. Grammar is fluid and constantly changing, and what we feel like is \u201cincorrect\u201d today may become accepted grammar in the future. In the case of *should of* instead of *should have,* so many people make this \u201cerror\u201d that this sense of the word *of* is well on its way to becoming \u201ccorrect\u201d grammar. I\u2019m not advocating this, indeed I think it\u2019s inelegant and clumsy; rather, I\u2019m merely pointing out this inevitability. And enjoying how much it rankles people to have this pointed out.

As with so many topics, it depends on which expert one consults. \n\n\"However, it got me thinking more about this topic, so I dug a little deeper into what some of the leading English usage reference books such as\u00a0The Chicago Manual of Style,\u00a0The Associated Press Stylebook, and various dictionaries have to say on the matter. It turns out the majority of these references allow the use of the word\u00a0that\u00a0to refer to people. While I am not personally a proponent of this usage, I think it\u2019s a good time to revisit the rules for\u00a0who\u00a0vs.\u00a0that.\"\n\nhttps://www.grammarbook.com/blog/who-vs-which-vs-that/who-vs-that/",

Reading is something that is only learned later, after they already know how to speak the language.\n\nBut since they learned based on sound alone, and since words like \"should've\" tend to be pronounced like \"should uv\", they misunderstand that as a child, and incorrectly internalize that \"uv\" sound as the word \"of\".\n\nThis is something that almost every native speaker has to **un**-learn in English class, and for many of us, that doesn't stick.\n\nBut for a non-native speaker, they never learned it incorrectly in the first place, because they almost always learn to speak and write the language at the same time.",

                                      "text": "There's quite a few reasons, let's break it down by racism and classism.\n\nFor racism:\n\n1. English may be their second language. English is the most common second language (iirc), therefore there are a lot of English speakers that do not have great grammar and pronunciation. Imagine an Asian American struggling through an English sentence, trying their best, and some jerk corrects them even though the meaning was evident. Sound rude and racist? Well it's the same online as in real life.\n\n2. Dialects are a thing. English has a wide dialect range and depending on what dialect you speak, the person who is speaking's grammar may be wildly different, not wrong. Dialects are often rooted deeply in ethnic groups within English speakers. For example, African Americans sometimes speak with a heavier emphasis on slang words or informal grammar. Are they wrong for doing so? No. It is their culture that has evolved over time. Correcting their grammar to *your* dialect would be wildly racist and insensitive.\n\n3. Correcting grammar, particularly for African Americans, harkens back to the literacy tests that were used to prevent them from voting. Due to systemic racism, African Americans are often less educated, often leading to less grammar education. This then prevents them from voting when they would fail the impossibly hard literacy test. Employers also use their lack of \"proper\" grammar as a means to prevent upward movement for those affected. This keeps African Americans out of higher paying jobs and enforces the status quo of systemic racism. These people aren't incapable of communication, they just don't speak the same dialect as the elite in charge of creating these racist systems.\n\n4. It promotes xenophobia. Immigrants often have heavy accents and subpar grammar due to English being their second language. The idea that grammar should be so strict makes life harder for these people and normalizes viewing them as \"less than\", when in fact they know more languages than the average American.\n\nFor classism:\n\n1. Very similar to point 3 above. Grammar is used as a gatekeeping tool to single out \"lower class\" people and prevent them from improving their living situation.\n\n2. Humiliation of the poor. Bad grammar is often used as a punchline is media. This is then played off as a fault of the person, rather than a failure of the education system. Having bad grammar is not the fault of the speaker/writer, but the system that failed them.\n\n3. Suggesting that bad grammar is inherent just like class/wealth. Language is very hard to learn later in life, once \"bad\" habits have built up, it can be hard to unlearn them. Due to this, a person can be \"locked in\" to their grammar being bad early in life. Then, once they grow up, it sticks with them as a marker of growing up \"low class\", limiting their opportunities since the elite class cares deeply about grammar. To the elite, grammar is like wealth where \"you just gotta work harder\" when in fact there are systems in place to prevent that.\n\n4. Gatekeeping things like the legal system. By hiding vital systems and information behind intentionally confusing language, you can prevent lower classes from accessing those systems easily. For example, the language used in a law may be so complicated that a lesser educated person may not be able to fully understand it, leading to them being more likely to accidentally break that law. This is then extended into all sorts of fields to systemically keep those in lower classes poor. This can be seen everywhere from the legal system, the medial system, all the way to the education system itself.\n\n5. Drives a wedge between classes. Grammar can be used as a marker of wealth and success the way we look at it now. This obviously is wrong, as the way you speak says nothing about you as a person.\n\nHope this clears things up for you!",

If you're faffing about on Reddit, use should of, should've, shoulda, whatever conveys your meaning.\n\n\"It's supposed to be\" is a weak start for a writing lecture, btw. What's the antecedent of that pronoun?  Also, why correct to these fairly uncommon contractions? They're just awkward, and probably acceptable lower on the formality scale than many other contractions. (The fanciest writing does not use contractions at all.)\n\n(Do we know if these forms really come as hearing spellings of the contractions? I could also see them arriving as false corrections or extensions of the -a forms. Possibly from analogy to kinda/kind of, sorta/sort of.)",
