I know Reddit has this thing about not giving a platform to anyone who isn\u2019t on the far left, but that\u2019s idiotic. The problem is, while Joe did interview those people, he used to be far more critical about their bullshit or wild claims (even though in my opinion he was _never_ critical enough). He also enjoyed a good conspiracy, maybe too much, but he also used to fact check things and argue on the side of science. Granted, I only watched his show for about six months back in 2016, but that\u2019s what I saw. He even had some really great and well-respected scientists on back then. Now hearing him talk, I don\u2019t know what happened. He went from at least having some interest in real science to taking fucking horse medicine and denying science. IMO it\u2019s a shame, it was nice to have someone who will talk to anyone, the og Alex Jones Interview was insanity and he really didn\u2019t try to portray it otherwise. Now he practically licks the dudes asshole. I don\u2019t get it",

Where she let McCarthy who does not have any medical degree of any kind, sit on her program and state matter-of-factly that her son's autism was caused by vaccinations, specifically the MMR vaccine.The MMR vaccine had nearly eradicated measles, mumps, and rubella in this country. If you didn't already know that, it's probably because society hasn't had to worry about those diseases for decades. But now thanks in no small part to Oprah it's now back! \n\n2)\n\n\nShe gave Doctor Phil his platform. There is a very interesting behind the bastards epsiode on Doctor Phil. But the main take away is he wouldn't be able to have a Grift to his level if he didn't have Oprah. Dr Phil is not a practicing psychologist, part of the reason is he innaproriate relationship with a female client. Some have said sexual assault, others rape.  But something definitely happened. He's physically abusive to his first wife and rumored to be with his second. Before Oprah he was a shady businessman and still is to this day. He's a narcissist and can't see how hippocritical he is. Ever see the bumfights episode? Where the guy dressed as Doctor Phil for his appearance to make a point? Doctor Phil didn't even give him 3 minutes for what was supposed to be an hour show, and acted high and mighty about it. This is a man ( Dr Phil) who has made a living off of publically breaching doctor patient confidentiality and a Grift as Americas Psychologist. All because of Oprah\n\n\n3)\n\nDoctor oz, do I need to write a paragraph on him? I will! She's 100% responsible for that fucker being around\n\n4) \n\nSylvia brown the \"psychic\" Oprah promoted her and her \"mysticism\" for years. She's a fake and Oprah knew she was a fake and continued to Grift anyway.\n\n\n5)\n\nShe encouraged people to buy and follow \" the secret\". Which is one of the most bullshit self help books ever created. \n\n\nas a viewer, the question is how to balance the good with the bad. Oprah Winfrey is an entertaining and (sometimes) informative television host with a massive audience, and she chooses to use that influence to promote the products and advice that she finds fit. At the end of the day, as with all television programming, viewers need to appreciate Oprah purely as an entertainer, and investigate any serious claims for themselves. We can't just take Oprah at her word.",

Once you're clean there's basically no brain damage ( other than severely down regulated GABAa receptors, but benzos there to counteract that, everything else is functioning normally) / issues, only thing would be still slightly down regulated GABAa receptors, which, if anything, speeds you up (when they're down regulated) and makes Glutamate have a more pronounced effect.\n\nIm sure most of these words mean nothing to you because I'm apparently a completely retarded person if a few years of benzos scrambled JPs brain then my addiction should make me completely braindead. Yet here I am, understanding pharmacology and neurology way better than you likely do.. Weird! I even just woke up literally 10 mins ago. \n\nVery long term use into old age seems a bit linked to dementia but AFAIK that's more theorized, rather than proven, correlation / causation etc (maybe people with severe anxiety just get dementia more often in later years, for example). Also sooo many people get dementia anyways who never touched drugs, so.. I'm not gonna fret, don't plan on living to be an old man, sounds horrible.",

You watched the Roger Stone talk, right? Did you have a high opinion of Roger Stone after watching it? I certainly didn't. I got to learn what an utter sleezebag he really is, and what people that associate with him have to say and ignore.

That goes for the church and the government.\n\nWhen civilization started forming governments, there's the theory that everyone just agreed together that a governing body was in the best interest for everyone and agreed to have rules and what not. Of course, we know that's not really what happened. What really happened is that one body exerted power over everyone else and forced them to follow their rules. It was of course for the benefit of the ones ruling and not the ones being ruled.\n\nWhen it came to democracy, women never played a part in the government. That's because they were the product, not the consumer. That also goes for slaves or the general population who weren't rich enough to actively participate in elections.\n\nThe government has historically been a way to make the exploitation of women and other non-participants more efficient.\n\nWhen it comes to witch trials, women not having the right to vote or not being able to get a job, insufficient education for women, criminalized abortions, banned birth control, etc... these are all driven to keep women's role in society as a mother dependent on her husband.",

They can initially make a pretty decent argument that as an atheist you can't really say stealing stuff or hurting people is objectively wrong. The christian has an advantage there in that for them there is no question whether those things are objectively wrong. It says so in the book. Objective morality, in their worldview, comes from the word of God.  \n\nBut it turns out there's a big disadvantage to that worldview too. Which you can uncover with a thought experiment. \"Suppose God appears to you, and commands you to torture and kill your own child. Would that be the right thing to do? Would you do it?\"  \nThis is obviously an absurd scenario which is never going to happen to anyone (well, except for Abraham), so why is it relevant? Because (unless the person gleefully agrees to murder their own child) it uncovers the fact that we actually have an internal sense of right and wrong which does not rely on the word of a moral authority.  \nIf you were forced to stick to moderate/realistic scenarios you wouldn't be able to reveal this particular fault in their logic. \"Suppose God told you to steal a candy bar\"... \"Ok, then stealing that candy bar is the right thing to do\".

(I'd be interested to hear why you think it's sexist though)  \nI get that you're a high-coupling thinker. So high-decoupling thinking such as thought experiments probably isn't very intuitive to you. But that doesn't mean that people who do enjoy decoupling are sexist for having a different style of thinking.  \n\nEdit: Here [a resource](https://everythingstudies.com/2018/05/25/decoupling-revisited/) on decoupling in case you're unfamiliar with the term.",

It could be a fully grown adult human in there, don't care, it's literally inside her body. None of these conservatives actually give two fucking shits about the baby, otherwise they wouldn't vote against literally every piece of legislation meant to help parents. It's all a ploy to stop people having sex because Jesus said so (even though he didn't). It's the same reason they hate sex ed even though that would prevent far more abortions than making them illegal.",

He had just recently moved to Texas and it was kind of like the perfect storm. He was very outspokenly skeptical (said he wasn\u2019t against but very high key was) of the Covid vaccine and thought wearing masks was stupid. Well to validate these feelings he sought out a lot of information and people that agreed with his views on this and it only put him farther down the redpill rabbit hole. Mix in with this how he was mega gaslit by republican propaganda about trans athletes \u201cinvading\u201d women\u2019s sports and mens rights being taken away (divorced dad shit even tho he\u2019s not one), and you have a cocktail that he drank down with no resistance. 3-4 years later he still calls himself a \u201cliberal on most things\u201d which in his defense, he is for some issues like weed and abortion, but definitely not \u201cmost\u201d. To give you an idea of where he is at, he is a huge supporter of Ron DeSantis and dogs on Biden literally all the time with all of the basic Fox talking points. And look, I don\u2019t like Biden either, but you don\u2019t call yourself \u201cliberal or leftist on most things\u201d and be a fucking Ron DeSantis fan boy. Also, he is very outspokenly anti feminism now and shits on leftists constantly. It hurts man, I used to be such a big fan. Even bought expensive ass tickets and saw him live at a sold out show years ago. I was a true supporter and he really disappointed me and so many others.",

Also a lot of backlash from people rightfully saying he was platforming those people and it was irresponsible. Over time he got mad at the backlash and warped it into thinking people wanted to \u201ccensor\u201d him because they were part of \u201ccancel culture\u201d. And the other noticeable change was Joe having on those controversial or straight up alt right/white nationalist guests with increased occurrence with less and less of the leftist guests ever making an appearance. Around this same period, Joe also started taking digs at \u201cbig liberal media\u201d, claiming they were out to get him and anyone who didn\u2019t agree with feminism, leftism etc. because they publicly disagreed with him platforming the pos\u2019s he was having on his show.",

Like bigfoot/alien conspiracy theorist one week and an actual scientist the next, it was a fucking joke and he wasn't even in on it lmao.\n\nHe is also certain type of idiot comedian. So many of them tend to think that when they tell terrible/offensive jokes and get backlash for it, that is somehow attacking their 'free speech'. None of these types understand what the 1st amendment is or means, they basically equate it to 'I should be able to say whatever I want and any repercussions for what I say are really people persecuting me unjustly'. It starts there, hating 'PC Culture' for not thinking his retarded standup is funny or shitting on some other comedian for something they said as \"Libruls run amok!\" Then he started eating up all kinds of silly alt-right bullshit the same way he did bad science/history/conspiracies etc because it 'sounds right'. Basically he would be called a contrarian if he were actually smart and doing real investigating or what have you, but hes not so he has an endless rotation of grifters and hacks to talk about how everyone else lives in a bubble wrapped echo chamber and how he and his show really get to the tough truth of the matter.",

A soldier's life in war is worth nothing but a statistic.  A sweatshop worker's wellbeing and quality of life is below a living wage, only getting as much as they can as mandated by the powers that be or in desperation.  How much is a homeless person's life worth?  How much is an orphan in an war-torn country?   How about a child's life that is destroyed to protect a developing organism that may not even make it or be cared for?  These mother fuckers completely overlook the wellbeing, trauma, and destruction that is inflicted upon a female's body and mind (I would say woman but children are often victim to this).  This asshole doesn't even see the person carrying the baby as possessing any worth - yet wants to ride a high horse talking about the value of life?  Fucking hypocrites.",

That's what Joe failed to say when the other tool said \"two wrongs don't make a right\" as if it isn't wrong to force a child to give birth. They count the getting raped and giving birth as a single wrong. It's a package deal. If you get raped, and you're a little girl, and you get pregnant, you give birth. If you're a little boy, the odds of being raped drastically go down, and even if you do, you don't get pregnant, because it's all bullshit anyway. But no this isn't an attack on women.",

I don't think most critics listen to his podcast *at all.* I keep saying folks are missing the forest for the trees, and the more of the comments I read the more I see it. There's enough news articles and enough buzz around these topics that most of us seem to jump to conclusions with a minimal nudge.  Rogan has always leaned left and rarely holds his guests' feet to the fire. He still seems very clearly to be pro-choice.",

I see the difference in how Joe handles the conversation and how I would handle the conversation and, damn, I would probably alienate most of those people so damn quick they wouldn't even want to talk to me anymore.",

Or is this a bigger deal than I think it is.
