  "text": "TIFU by removing my girlfriend's tattoos in photoshop and realising I'm not as attracted to her as I thought and now I'm terrified for the future\nTL:DR at the bottom.\n\nEnjoy my fuck-up story, oddly enough for this sub, it did happen yesterday. Sorry for any mistakes, I'm not a native speaker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMe and my girlfriend exchange nudes frequently. They never leave our phones/computers and we trust each other on that. I like to mess around in photoshop as a hobby and often times I use my gf's nudes for practice. Change the lighting, remove/add things in the background, sometimes I edit her into a playboy cover for a laugh. A few days ago I bought a new laptop, as my old one died some time ago. I installed photoshop on it yesterday and wanted to mess around with it. I found some tutorials online about photoshop tattoo removal and decided to give it a try. Seeing as I had no work the next day, I also decided to get high. I gathered some pics of my girlfriend and went to work. \n\nMy girlfriend has a big tattoo on her upper chest (covering her collar bones and the upper part of her boobs), two smaller pieces on her hips, one between her shoulder blades and some smaller ones on her legs and arms. When we met she already had all the major ones and she did two more while with me. It has never bothered me, I thought her tattoos are cool. But before falling for her I never imagined myself to be with such a heavly tattooed girl but I hadn't really thought about it since then.\n\nNow, I edited the pictures, starting from the smaller tattoos and evencually getting rid of the big chest one. I followed a tutorial and made a damn good job in my opinion. I ended up doing three pics and when I was admiring my work I got very... Well, I got hornier then I ever had in my life. \n\nI've always considered my gf's body to be a 10/10. That combined with her wonderful personality made me fall in love quick and hard, and I didn't even think to wonder how she would look like if she didn't have the tattoos. Well now I know. And to me she would look infinitly better.\n\nI regret using photoshop a lot last night. She obviously can't get rid of the tattoos. Not only would it be horribly expensive, but also she really loves them. Also I don't think it's my place to even ask that. She's also a tattoo artist and scheduled to have a \"half a body\" tattoo done in two or so months by another artist who she's a great fan of. I won't ask her to skip the tattoo. She's very excited about it and has been saving up for a long time. I was never particularly happy that she was getting it, but I was just glad she was excited and again, it's her choice what she puts on her body.\n\nNow I realise just I don't like tattoos on her. I thought a lot last night and realised the signs were there, but for some reason it has never occured to me. For example when we chatted about her tattoo plans I asked her not to tattoo her tummy too soon because I like how soft it lookes on it's own. She would say in that a few years I will have a wife covered from head to toe in ink and I always laughed it off because I didn't want to think about it. I also had a shameful realisation that I've been enjoying sex a lot more since we started to do it doggy style. The one tattoo on her back usually get's covered by her hair so you can't see any tattoos. \n\nI'm kinda freaking out. As I mentioned, my \"favourite parts\" of her  body are the ones with no tattoes on them, that being the back and her waist. The tattoo she's getting is going to go from her arm, down her side and down the leg. Which means it will be pretty much impossible to not see. I'm really ashamed to say I'm afraid I won't be as attracted to her when she does it. I'm afraid to even bring it up because she has horrible body image issues and I'm scared she would be really effected if I said I'm worried about her getting the tattoo. I also know with the way things are going (her becoming a tattoo artist and such) she is going to get more. \n\nI deleted the pictures this morning. They give an ultra boner but the worst moral hangover ever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL:DR\n\nI removed my gf's tattoos in photoshop and found out I'm much more attracted to her without them. She's getting a body-long piece done in two months and I'm afraid I won't be as attracted to her as I am now.",

Cut to me grabbing the pants leg of every smooth faced man that remotely looked like my dad unable to find him. \n\nOne young man just asked me to stand still and not grab his pants, asked my name and my dads name and essentially he stood there hollering for my dad. Didn\u2019t understand why until I got older (cause of the implication of a lost little girl with a stranger and her grabbing his pants). My dad laughed so hard, but immediately regrew and never did a clean shave again.",

Sometimes close to what my hair used to be, sometimes unnatural red shades (like a deep berry or flame orange), with the pale skin and freckles to make it obvious that I am a natural redhead. But I can't imagine how I would feel if my hair went black or even dark brown (which both my parents have/had before going silver). Happy to hear that your mom is feeling better about her hair now!",

If they choose not to do what you\u2019d like then you can decide what to do with it - live with it or split. Dumping someone because you aren\u2019t attracted to them clean shaven - or with hairy pits and legs - is honestly totally fine.

I'm not saying someone should or should not be upset at their partner having or not having either of them. I think everyone is allowed to bring up their preferences, though. \n\nMy point was just: I don't think facial hair preferences are on the same level as body hair preferences. I don't spend hours looking at my partner's armpits, while I would spend hours looking at their face. So a preference in facial hair will most likely have a larger effect on attraction.\n\nThat's the point I was trying to make :)",

As a side note, I'm all for women doing whatever they want with their body hair, but as a woman, I can't stand having hair on my legs, underarms, etc. Not because of how it looks but because of how uncomfortable it gets. I'm sure that's just because I've shaved for so long.",

I grew it all out and at a year I cut the hair up top. (I couldn\u2019t stand it being so long, but I did what I said I was going to do). But I did like the beard so I kept it. She really dislikes it. She much prefers me clean-shaven, or it really really short.  \n\nIt must not be too bad though, I proposed last year and she said yes when it was at its longest. I did trim it down once at two years though.  \n\nI am going to get it trimmed down really really short (like to 1in-1.5in) for the wedding tomorrow, but she knows it\u2019s coming back as well.\n\nEdit: a word",

She rocked it because as a whole she's beautiful but to be honest that's the worst she's ever looked.   \n    \nWhen we reconnected she had just past shoulder-length, straight, perfectly blonde hair. Looked amazing. Gorgeous woman. She was always questioning what my preference was. I didn't have one. I didn't care what she did with her hair. She liked me and that mattered light years beyond what her hair style happened to be. I might have said something to the effect of \"you'll look good no matter what.\"     \n    \nShe dyed it pink.    \n    \nI guess we were both fucking idiots at the time.",

He said \u201cHonestly, I would like it shaved better, I\u2019m just really not into pixies.\u201d \n\nI started a topical treatment and he puts on gloves and helps me apply it at night because a lot of the thinning is at the back of my head where I can\u2019t see it. And he always tells me I\u2019m beautiful and my hair doesn\u2019t look bad at all. I just didn\u2019t include all of that in one paragraph of information. \n\nI appreciate you looking out for me and don\u2019t think you should feel bad, but jumping to calling him immature and a loser without knowing very much about what happened and our relationship is why people are being critical of you. And as I said before, he never said he would be in attracted to me or love me any less, he said he just doesn\u2019t like that particular haircut.

I told him it was ok to not like my hair cut, but the way he had spoken to me (he was being a real jerk) was unacceptable. He acknowledged that, and apologized. He then felt bad about basically telling me not to get that hair cut, as I should be able to do what I want with my body. I told him he wasn't telling me I had to cut my hair one way, just this one style he didn't like, which is ok. He looks terrible in a buzz cut and I've asked him to never get one, so it's totally fair.",

She married me with this beard and it would be unfair to take it away from her. That being said, it's hair, it grows back. She would most definitely laugh at me if I shaved. Which I plan to do someday just for the reaction. But it grows fast and I hate my naked face too, it feels wrong and I look way too young. Ultimately she wouldn't leave me over it, you just pick and tease when you're in a loving comfortable relationship. I don't see why some people act like preferences (especially such easily changeable ones) are such a big deal or a topic to walk on eggshells around. I love sun dresses. My wife fucking HATES any and all dresses and laughs whenever I hint that she should wear them. I think they're sexy, she says they make her feel like a little girl. I have seen my wife in a dress literally 3 times in our wntire relationship. 1. A sundres she bought and wore ONCE for me early on. 2. Her wedding dress. 3. Her bridesmaid dress for my brother's wedding. And even though she still totally refuses a HUGE preference of mine, I still love her. People gotta chill.",

My brothers and I, on the other hand, recognized his knees and his voice and went tearing across the gate area to give his knees a hug.\n\nUntil my mom passed, he never grew face fuzz.

I have only seen pictures of him without from when he was younger. I look young for my age. And he would look sooo much younger if he shaved his beard. It makes him look a lot older, which I like. I don't even have to tell him I don't want him to shave his beard because he is adamant that it will stay. His mom tries to get him to cut it shorter and he won't even do that haha",

Love and attraction are certainly related but they're still very different things and in a healthy relationship, any significant changes someone would like to make should be discussed with their partner and that *includes* significant changes in appearance. A guy shouldn't just shave his beard off. A girl shouldn't just cut her hair short. \n\nWhen a partner makes such a significant change, especially without prior discussion, it can put a huge amount of strain on the relationship. While logically, their partner knows that they *should* be fine with such a change, logic doesn't govern attraction and the loss of attraction can be heartbreaking. It's hard to deal with even if discussed previously but making a sudden change without mentioning it beforehand can feel like a huge betrayal.\n\nObviously, it's easier to deal with if the change wasn't a choice e.g. for medical reasons but when it's a choice made in isolation without any discussion and it directly affects how attracted you are to your partner, then it's at best thoughtless and at worst; cruel. Neither of those is good for a relationship. Communication is always key.",

She was beautiful, working on her masters degree, owned her house, would cook for me, foot massages, we rarely fought. It was heaven! Only one problem, I didn't love her. I didn't fully realize it at first. We were planning a future together and I thought I was happy. But, there was always the voice in the back of my head telling me the truth. There were signs I ignored. I just didn't want to listen. So, I went to my Dad for advice. He always gave great life advice.  \"If you don't love her now, you'll never grow to love her\" he said. \"Do you really want to take that gamble that it will all resolve itself? Do you want to wait 10 years when you own a house, have kids, that you still don't love her. That's not fair to her.\"\n\nI broke up with her that day and I don't regret it. It sucked. She was confused and cried a lot and said she didn't understand. I hated hurting her. I sobbed like a baby.  But, deep down, once I really thought about it, I was attracted to her, but I didn't truly love her.\n\nShe deserved someone who really loved her. She deserved someone who couldn't live without her, who loved everything about her.  I didn't.\n\nI met someone later who I fell madly in love with. We've been married 20 years with 2 kiddos.  I'm still madly in love with my wife to this day.  We have our problems, but I'll love her until the day I die.\n\nI looked up my ex years later on Facebook. She seemed happily married with kids.\n\nPlease DO NOT try to convince yourself. While you're alone, walk yourself through each scenario and then walk around, in that decision, and see how it makes you feel. Option 1: Stay with her and move in together, later get married. How does that feel? Option 2: Break up with her. How does that feel. Allow yourself to truly feel each of those options.\n\nGood luck OP.\n\n*edit: Thanks for the gold and silver Reddit Fam!  It put a big smile on my face.\n\n*edit:  I want to clarify. That this is my own personal journey. I am not telling anyone to leave their relationship.\n\nSome commenters have stated it took them years to develop their love and how they're happy. That's great! We're all different. Every relationship is different. My marriage is not perfect. We are not a Disney fairytale.  But, I'm sure we can all agree that marriage is difficult. I retract my statement that you MUST be madly in love. As long as you're honest with yourself and your partner.\n\nChoosing the right partner is not easy, black and white, or one single recipe for success. Life is complex. I wish everyone luck in their lives and wish you all happiness.\n\n*edit 3: There are a few comments that this is bad advice and unrealistic and that I'm giving people in the delusion that love is a Disney movie.\n\nFirst, I'm not going to apologize for being in love with my wife. However, we, like all marriages, have our problems.  Yes, real life love takes years to develop and grow. I agree. It has been A LOT of hard work, talking, fighting, forgiving, self reflection.  We work really hard to maintain our marriage.\n\nOur story is only ONE template of love and marriage. I'm not claiming to have the answers, however it breaks my heart to see people miserable and stuck in unhappy marriages. \n\nMy only advice to OP was... be honest with yourself and your partner. Don't waste people's time of you're not serious or genuinely in love.\n\n If everyone who disagrees with me would take the time to read all of the other comments, you'll see how many people have gone through very similar situations.  Heartbreaking situations that shouldn't be ignored.",

The feeling of looking at someone and not being able to help yourself from smiling and just getting that warm feeling inside. Sucks to remember it because you haven't felt in years, and not for the lack of dating people and feeling the waters. Sucks because you might never get to feel it again.\n\nWell, to be honest, I can kinda feel that level of affection towards my dog, so that's something.",

You didn\u2019t love her anymore and that\u2019s a HUGE reason. People change a lot, love changes with it, and sometimes the end results are two people who don\u2019t have it anymore. \n\nAnyone calling you cruel just need to butt out of that. It\u2019s not their business. Unless you were excessively mean in the break up, you were just doing what you felt is right. \n\nI left my first serious boyfriend who I was with for a little over 2 years who was the sweetest guy ever. He was so nice to everyone and got along with everybody in the whole word basically. However, he would get stressed behind closed doors about thing that were small and have very intense reactions to stress. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. People made me feel horrible about it. My mom would talk about how much she missed him constantly. But you know what? He eventually moved on and found someone that is a much better fit than I ever was for him and then everyone else moved on with it. \n\nGive it time. It takes awhile but one day you\u2019ll feel free of it. Allow it to hurt, but don\u2019t allow the hurt to be your focus. Just learn whatever lessons you need, grieve as necessary, and focus on yourself for a bit. She will feel better too as long as she is able to put the work in to move on. \n\nLots of people break up and move on- you can too. Good luck my guy.",

I went through a divorce after a 6 year relationship with someone I thought I loved, but it turns out I was just committing to a relationship with someone I enjoyed being around, regardless of their faults. It was a painful breakup in the end, but it was mutual. As life went on we grew further and further apart into our own life plans that didn't align to each other's values. \n\nMy current relationship though? I will literally burn a city to the ground if anything happens to her. I will do anything for her. It's much more than commitment. It's a deep-rooted subconscious drive to make her the happiest and most successful person she can be. Our values align so well, we communicate so well, the sex is fantastic, our life plans are very similar. It doesn't feel like work to try and find happiness in the relationship, it feels necessary for survival to work through arguments. There is no option but to figure out how to work through disagreements. \n\nI'm not saying it's a perfect relationship, just trying to describe how I've come to interpret love for me. It might be totally different for you.",

Her appearance has never even been a factor because I knew her via text and phone calls at the beginning so I fell in love with who she is, not what she is. \n\nI feel like the strongest relationships are those where the physical is a secondary element and that just being there for each other and knowing each other is enough to keep your love alive. Obviously being able to be intimate helps but if you cant maintain your love without the physical then you have a problem. There are many reasons the physical can suddenly stop and being able to still connect despite this is critical. If a change in appearance is enough to make someone second guess then that person didn't truly love them in the first place.",

I go visit to help get her moved in there, and the plan stays the same, just with a different destination. \n\nThat weekend moving her in we had lots of fun, and it all felt very passionate because I hadn\u2019t seen her in a while. But during the trip I realized that I categorically did not want to live in that place, it was absolutely not my vibe. And that forced me to realize I had to break up with her.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t really because I didn\u2019t want to live in that city, it was because realizing how much I dreaded being there forced me to acknowledge I didn\u2019t actually want to be with her. She was fantastic, but I wasn\u2019t in love, and it had to end. When I got home I took a couple days to gather myself and then called and broke it off. It was especially hard because I\u2019ve never had a breakup that was completely one sided from my perspective before or since. We got off the phone, she sounded so hurt, I hated myself and cried in my shame. If I let it go on any longer though, the pain would\u2019ve been way more devastating. \n\nSame things that were mentioned in your comment and OPs, I had indications it wasn\u2019t the right relationship before all that mess took place, and I didn\u2019t listen to myself, which made the situation worse. I guess I\u2019m sharing to say that you\u2019re right, you can\u2019t force romance, and as encouragement to the folks in here that are in similar situations to what we went through. It\u2019s a terrible pain to cause someone else so much hurt, but it\u2019s better than letting the situation get deeper for a much worse payoff later. I\u2019m proud of you, myself, and anyone who has to navigate something similar and does the tough thing.",

We've only been apart for six weeks, shouldn't I feel more devastated that he destroyed our 14 year relationship to be with someone he'd only known for a few months longer than their six week affair? Shouldn't I feel more devastated that they were engaged less than a month after that? I can't even feel more anger for what he's done to me than pity for what he's doing to himself.\n\nTo be honest, most of what I feel is relief. To be brutally honest, I'm more excited for my future without him than I ever was for my future with him, and that really sucks to admit.",

                          "text": "Finding the root cause is more of a Freudian/Psychodynamic school of thought, of which there is little evidence actually works (though people do claim to feel better, about on par with plain ol talk-therapy). That there's this \"thing/event\" inside of you that if only you discover, you can unravel all the anxiety and fix it. Unfortunately, this isn't really how it works in practice - you just get a bit better at handling the anxiety, and medication is indeed a valid way to handle anxiety (in conjunction with restructuring your relationship with it). As someone who has suffered from crippling anxiety and depression, I can attest that years of CBT and other therapies have done far less for me, despite my best efforts, than a daily pill ever has. Am I pleased about it? No. Is it reality? Yes. \n\nThe real paradox of \"do I have a fear of commitment or did I just not find someone I feel in love with?\" is the basis of so many columns, self-help books, Ted talks, and therapist appointments. The idea of committing oneself, for life, to someone that one feels no real romantic love for, and probably never will, is indeed quite unsettling and bound to produce anxiety. Is it a fear of commitment? Depends on how you want to view it, I suppose.\n\nAlso, I'm not trying to come down on you. I lived a very similar story as you did, but I haven't found anyone else yet. I don't regret breaking up, but I do get lonely and find myself sometimes struggling with the paradox after yet another lackluster date. But all I can do is try, you know?",

But that\u2019s not necessarily true. Plenty of people throughout history can attest to how it took them years to get there, even after being married. I found out recently that the woman that The Sound of Music is based on didn\u2019t love the father of the von Trapp children, but just the children themselves. She liked him a lot but didn\u2019t think she loved him. So she married him to help and provide for the children whom she loved. A few years down the road though she ended up deeply in love with him too, and didn\u2019t regret a thing.\n\nMy experience is somewhat similar, since my wife and I needed to figure out if real life was meant to feel like a romance novel. Now, 1.5 years into our marriage, I am really glad I took the plunge.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t work for everyone and some people end up marrying a monster. But it\u2019s another voice to consider here, though probably not a popular one. As I said, conventional wisdom and our society\u2019s pressures, yadda yadda yadda.\n\nhttps://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-sound-of-music-real-family.html/",

I considered a happy marriage the highest form of success in life (my personal opinion).\n\nNow think of something or someone you love in a non romantic way. A friend, a pet, a certain band, your favorite food. Something you couldn't bear to be without. How does it make you feel? How do you feel when that person or thing is not around. Get in touch with your feelings.  As another commenter mentioned, work on yourself before you try to be in a relationship.  Good luck finding love.",

It's based on the almost mythical status our society gives to \"deep love\" - even as most if the people talking about it readily admit that they don't know what it is really. Both you and OP would benefit from seriously thinking and discussing about what they think love is and what it means. Is it a feeling? Attraction? Commitment? Trust? Belief? Whatever it is, what does it mean if you don't experience it all the time? Because at some point, there will be a moment you don't. Does it mean it never was there? Or it was but went away? In that case can it come back? Can it be learned? If not, why not? Should you really make life-long decisions based on an vague experience you don't even understand? What do you and your partner want from a relationship, and what is really required for achieving it?",

My last serious relationship I fell in love.. she went along for the ride for two years. I didn\u2019t see that once in the relationship it\u2019s so weird. I absolutely loved her family too, her sisters and mom were awesome. In an innocent way.. I think I may have maybe been in love with her sister a bit too. Not like sexual I just thought she was great. All of them.. even her dad was awesome. All her family was great.. and there were a ton of them. \n\n\nI look back at pictures and I\u2019m there with her smiling and she always looks detached and distant. How did I not notice that when it was happening or in the moment? Did her whole family see it and I didn\u2019t? It is really humiliating now cause they aren\u2019t idiots.. or course they did. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t see the signs and everyone pitied me and didn\u2019t have the heart to tell me it was one sided. I\u2019d like to say I wish someone would have but thinking back.. that\u2019s wouldn\u2019t have been great I\u2019d have fallen into a depression and gave up. So in some weird way maybe I appreciate that in hindsight. Not sure why I\u2019m leaving the comment this is just a good thread and noticed my angle was slightly different than the others so worth sharing. \n\n\nIt took me a long time to be able to accept all of that. It was hard to swallow but I did it and I did it alone and now I do feel better and stronger. Almost like I was a kid and I\u2019ve grown up now it\u2019s funny. I still will sometimes like reach for her in bed at night and then open my eyes like wtf am I doing no one\u2019s in bed with you dummy. Anyways though.. love is convoluted and really hard to navigate. Each person is unique and there\u2019s no cookie-cutter approach to any of it. Each bond is unique like a fingerprint.. love is amazing and awful and interesting and everything all at once. Be careful and be safe.",

My mom was madly in love with him; dad said he never brought it up because he did care about her and didn\u2019t feel he could do better, and he\u2019d have been happy to stay married until we were all grown (I\u2019m the oldest and was 18, my youngest sibling was 8). My mom said that wasn\u2019t enough for her, and they divorced. It was incredibly fucked up and sad. My dad died two years later; my mom has been single ever since. She felt like a widow when he died. She never fell out of love. I\u2019m 32 now, and think about it all often. What might my mom\u2019s life have been like if my dad had been honest and let her find someone that truly loved her? I wouldn\u2019t exist, but I\u2019d also be none the wiser. I wish he\u2019d let her find her happiness instead of robbing her of nearly 25 years. \n\nI hope OP heeds your advice, even if it doesn\u2019t conclude in his breaking up with his GF.",

I would say we probably should have just been really great friends. I hadn't had much success with love up to this point and was very lonely before that relationship. So it was especially hard to make this decision. I would encourage you to read others stories. I wish i could tell you exactly what it was. Like \"too much salt\" or \"more sugar please\".  Maybe it was that. Maybe she wasn't challenging enough for me.  It was so confusing for me too.  I would think \"what's wrong with me, I should be so happy\".  It wasn't until I met my current wife that I finally felt a strong connection with someone.  We're not perfect. Hell, we've had some really bad times. But, I love her. Good luck friend. I'm sorry if I didn't answer your question. I would encourage you to work on yourself but only for yourself. Do things that you love to do and you will find someone who shares your interest and have similar likes.  I hope you find someone that you can spend all night talking to. Stay positive and learn to love yourself first.",

                  "text": "I'm in this situation right now and am typing this out for my own sake because I need to be honest with myself. We've been married a few years now, and I didn't really notice/admit it to myself until a year ago when I fell for a friend/colleage of mine. We are no longer colleages and that door is closed. I never pursued those feelings because I want to be able to look at myself in the mirror and not be ashamed. They persisted for at least a year, so I am confident it wasn't just lust.\n\nIt's guy wrenching because I can see myself being a substandard husband, and my wife deserves better. When you really love someone, you get that free motivation to go above and beyond for them, to do the little extra things. I don't have that, and haven't for maybe 2 years now - its hard to remember. but my wife does have that motivation. She really loves me and values me, she's smart and beautiful, but I genuinely find her boring, partly because she is, her topics of conversation almost never go beyond retelling inane workplace conversations in excruciating detail, or gossip about her friends. For the past year before she moved away, I looked to my friend/colleage to fill that void, to get deep into discussion of science, theology, morality, and deep personal conversations about ourselves. I do understand that this is emotional cheating and from a woman's perspective, considered just straight up cheating. \n\nWe've been putting off having children, partially due to economics, but I need to make a decision, because if I do end things, she needs time to meet someone else and settle. We are in our thirties and I do not want to waste her remaining fertile years then leave her\n\nDespite knowing all this, it's not an easy decision. One is because it would be economically disastrous (cowardly, I know). Two, because maybe my expectations are unrealistic, maybe my thought patterns are distorted. There may still be a lot I haven't admitted to myself, and if I try to get advice from someone else, I am likely to present the information in a way to guide their perception. Maybe this would be the worst decision I ever make, and I will only know once I make it. But at present I do know I am not fulfilled.",

I can only imagine what you're going through and I wish I was there to give you a great big hug.\n\nI wish I could help you and advise you what to do, but I know I shouldn't because this is someone's marriage. I am not a therapist or psychologist.  Maybe that should be your next step in addressing this situation so you can feel confident that you arrived at whatever decision you make with the help of a professional. I would also greatly caution you to do your due diligence when finding a therapist or family psychologist. They're people just like us. Some are great at their job and some are not as great. It's best that you come to your conclusion with a Dr/Therapist that you feel comfortable with their thoughts and advice.\n\nWhen I was in my twenties I dreamt of being a couples therapists.  However, I was adamant that I wouldn't do it to help save marriages. I would do it to help save lives.  I wanted to help people work out their true, honest thoughts to help them come to honest conclusions.  We only get one life and I believe you should live a fulfilling one.\n\nYou're not a coward for any of your thoughts. I commend you for not pursuing things with your colleague. This is a very difficult position to be in and it's brave of you to address this very sensitive situation.  \n\nWhen we're lost, we have to look back and analyze how we got here.  When did we turn left when we should've turned right. Only then can we make the proper course corrections that will allow is get back on track and truly move forward. I wish you the best.

Fast forward 3 years, we're engaged after she kept pressuring me, we keep having monthly fights over unpredictable, random, small insignificant issues, and I don't want to continue. But she's hopeful for us to work it out, and I'm afraid of ending it on account of her lack of support system and history of depression and self harm. -sigh- I'm now here trying to balance what to do, and how to do it.",

And like every post here, she, too, was great on paper, but I would have moments, either sober or high, where I genuinely questioned whether I actually \"loved\" her. She is still one of my oldest and best friends, but I think even when we were together, I may have confused loving her as a friend to actually being in love with her (if that makes sense). \n\nI honestly don't really know what love is, or if I'm just over-complicating this in my mind. I don't think I've had good \"role models\" in my life to show me what true love really is - my parents are still together, but I don't think they \"love\" each other, and I think it's been like that my whole life. I genuinely don't know the signs to look for, what does it feel like to be in love, how do you know that you're in love??",

My only intention, after reading this line, was a tale of caution.  \n\nI thought I was in love. After intense self reflection I realized I never was. I realized there were signs that i ignored. Sound familiar. I don't think he should just leave her and I didn't suggest that. But she's getting more tattoos and he's concerned. So... He needs to evaluate how he really feels about her. What if he pushes through, stays with her and never fully appreciates her? Maybe they'll live happily ever after. I don't know. But, if you read many of the comments before mine you'll find story after story of years wasted on a love that was never there. Would you want that kind of relationship?  It's heartbreaking. He needs to be honest with himself and her. Maybe further thought will help him realize how much he loves her. Who knows.",

I mean I love a girl in thigh high stockings for instance and when my woman surprises me with those I get instantly turned up to 11. I definitely would not want them tattooed on though. There is something about naked skin, it is the vulnerability and trust I guess.\n\nIt is perfectly natural to be feeling the way you are feeing on this. I would just suggest that you think carefully about what your future holds with this woman. Physical attraction is much more important than we pretend to not give it credit for. It may just be that she is not right for you and you are not right for her. Think deeply now about the things that you have been ignoring or glossing over. Then choose a way forward and live with the choice. If you don't think deeply now, you will find the truth bubbles to the surface 20 years later, and it comes out far uglier than it would be now.",

Anything left unaddressed will become a small crack in the foundation, that hard times will find a way to crack wider.\n\nIn OP's case, tattoes are mildly unattractive to him. There is every indication that the tattoo coverage is going to increase to drastic proportions over time. So options are. Change her (unfair on her and could lead to later resentment, she would have to not only be willing to change for him but also be willing to stomp down every feeling of resentment that hard times will later cause to boil to the surface), change him (unfair on him, but provided he accepts the later niggles of concequences that this could lead to, then possible to work), change them both into single individuals with the opportunity to find partners more aligned to their life choices.\n\nChange her is undoubtedly the worst option and even bringing it up is a bad idea.",

But he has to do that with his eyes wide open is all I am saying. Doing it just because, \"rumors have it that I should be able to look past this issue\", will come back to bite him in years to come.

All sexy clothing plays with this. But tattoos designs usually treat the body just as a canvas, the body is there for the tattoo, not the tattoo for the body. Rarely you see designs that are meant to be looked at from close and afar.\n\nConceptually, I find lots of tattoo art beautiful and I also relate to the concept of making your body your own.\n\nBut I often find them oddly distracting when looking at human body as a whole, especially when some body parts are heavily covered and others are blank.\n\n In a way, full body suits or tribal patterns covering lightly the whole body are less distracting for me from the human being wearing them.",

Single right now, and only recently I have started to think about this seriously 'what if people don't like my tattoos'? Do I need to care about this??? Bc I kind don't want to. But...\n\nI mean you can't help what you like but you need to think about it if this is a deal breaker or not in the long run :-/\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:\n\nthanks for all the encouraging words :-) it helps to talk about those little fears, so that they don't fester and become a serious issue.

              "text": "1000000000% this! During my undergrad in human physiology I took a class about development with an extensive unit on sexual preferences of adults. Basically it's been verified (through reputable studies with replicable results) that people who have alternative style choices (tattoos, piercings, goth style, etc) get ranked as \"extremely attractive\" and \"extremely unattractive\" more than people who conform. Even just a headshot of a woman with a visible piercing will get more ratings as a 1 and more ratings as a 10 than the same woman without a visible piercing. \n\nHumans have been tattooing themselves for thousands of years. Tattoos have symbolized maturity, status, prowess, skills, lineage, etc. The puritanical idea that tattoos make someone cheap or unattractive is the new position. Are they a necessary component for someone to be desirable? No. Is it a given that the normative stance towards tattoos is a negative one? Also, no! \n\nAs for me, I'm a bisexual woman dating a somewhat heavily tattooed man and I think his tattoos are SO sexy. I'd be attracted to him if he didn't have them, but it drew me to him instantly. I couldn't tell you why it is, but ever since I was a child I've thought tattoos are really really cool and have always been attracted to them. My previous partner did not have tattoos and I always wished he had, I genuinely think I would have been more attracted to him if he had them. I don't know why, but it's just a strong preference of mine.\n\nSo yes, a lot of people are probably turned off by the fact that I have a couple visible tattoos, but a lot of people find it actively attractive. But I have them, they're a choice I made, and I like them, and they make me happy. If someone is turned off by that, there are probably a lot of aspects of my personality and my life they would be equally turned off by, and it's not really my problem.",

People also can see things in one another that they don't see in themselves, which is a vital part in a relationship, as our partners should support us even through the things we hate about ourselves.

I always tell them that while you should get something small to start with, if you decide to keep getting more be sure to find a good artist, commit a decent amount of money and make sure that you have a theme or large piece that all flows together and looks like actual art. Having a bunch of little ones that don't fit well together will age badly, they just can't look classy and as you get older you're way more likely to regret them. You really get what you pay for and good quality line work and detail stands out.",

I think it's unfortunate that in their fight for \"\"general acceptance\"\" or\"\"X-positivity\"\" most of redditors don't acknowledge limits (from planetary to biological or romantical). Everything is not possible for everybody all of the time. We have limited options either for changing society or ourselves etc.\n\nIt's especially true in times of possible ecological collapse where we have no idea what will actually be possible in a few decade, but we will possibly have much fewer limited options (from food to dating). Some social justice fights such as those we have now are only possible because we live in very energy-priviledged societies where we have time to think/research about those causes. I'm afraid we are taking it for granted, we should be much more warry of limits.",

My marching band alone had over 200 people after you include the flag corps and alternates. After you include another 100 ish in turnover each year (graduations/incoming freshmen) that's 500 ish people. As a squad leader my junior and senior year I made sure to know everyone, I'm sure I missed a few the first two years but still, that's JUST the marching band. Then throw in orchestra, choir, rugby, In The Know (think jeopardy but you can interrupt the host and don't have to phrase it as a question), and just people in class (group projects, lap partners, etc... Not just existing in the same room) that number gets a few hundred more. So realistically high school for me I had direct interaction (conversation not just existence) of well over 12 hours with over 800 people. Now, some of those I also went to middle and elementary school with so that's why I low balled the numbers to not count people more than once. \n\nThen of people I had previously went to school with I knew only 35 off the top of my head that went to the same university so pretty much no repeats there. Again there was marching band, lab partners, the honors program, various clubs and sports, and people who I just went to go play video games in their dorm room and I would say 300 is conservative but idk if I would still recognize more than that 10 years later.\n\nAs far as outgoing idk about that, some of the activities I liked just forced me to interact with a ton of people. From my entire school career I would say I had 50ish actual friends and of those I really only kept in touch with about half. Still, I was going off your 12 hours of direct contact definition so I went off that.",

They break up the curves and lines our brains look for, put new lines and curves where we don't expect them, etc. Some people find it attractive, but it's a subset.\n\nI think this is something people need to bear in mind before getting one. It is _not_ free. There is a cost. The cost might be ending up single more than you would have otherwise. \n\nAre you willing to pay it? Needs to be spoken of more in the planning stages.",

I am not spiritual or religious in any way and I have issues with piercings/tattoo's depending on the quantity/size/location etc.\n\nTattoo's are not really any different than other hobbies in this way. Some people will find you unattractive for your lifestyle and choices. This should be expected. What is important is that they respect your personal decisions.",

For example, my family has the fat upper arm that has the skin flap that jiggles, I will never tattoo my upper arms because I don't want to draw attention to that. Nor will I tattoo my chest in any way because I will be having a breast reduction to hopefully help prevent the hunch back that's coming. I wouldn't want anything to get messed up during that, so if I opt to do something there it won't be until I'm at least 45. At that point, I don't know if I would want something there, ya know?  But my legs and back- ask bets are off lol! No one seems to have had any issues nor do they winkle too badly before 70, so that's where I'll be putting any more tattoos. \n\n\nSeriously though, don't change your self for a potential future partner. You'll resent them before you even meet then.",

Get that shit nailed down Day One of any potential relationship.

My ex downright hating on my tattoos hurt me more then I thought in hindsight. I felt rejected in a core part of my being. I gave it a lot of thought over the years, it's a complicated issue but in that regard also quite simple. It also comes down to trust. You like me as a person and tattoos are a big part of my person. Trust my taste and just let it go. So for me, a partner should either like it, or have no opinion. I don't care whether or not a partner has tattoos. I will judge ugly tattoos :p but again, i won't reject you as a person. Does it make you happy? Then it makes me happy. :)\n\nAnd yes, you are right. I do nail that down quite quickly now. Sucks when it doesn't work out but it usually exposes some other issues as well.. Some men who don't like tattoos on women (yes that specifically) also don't like independent women etc..

I'm a huge nerd but also a musician and it surprises people when they learn about my personal life after meeting my professional self, and it has turned many, many people off. So there's an aspect of attraction when it involves a person's passions and people will either be attracted or repelled by that.\n\nAt the end of the day just do you. Don't worry if you'll scare people off with your tattoos and passions, go all in and it will ultimately attract people better suited for you. I can't express the reality of how many times I met someone, fell for them, then saw their lack of passions or what they were into and thought \"meh, long term I don't think this will work.\"\n\nJust be you :)",

There's lust, there's that newness around everything, there's exploring each other. Smaller things can be overlooked but eventually they grow bigger and bigger until they become real problems.\n\nYour tattoos are something you wear out in the open. It isn't something you can hide until the 3rd date (maybe it is if they are covered by clothing but you'll be naked in front of them sooner or later so the point still stands) so the other person is either going to have a problem with them, in which case they have a problem with you, or they are going to love them and love you. Neither of those things are in your control, all you can do is be you. I think you should care, but in a different way: care that they care because something like this post WILL come up in the future. Doubly so considering you're a tattoo artist yourself, this is your career.",

I can't wait because even though I kinda lost interest in tattoos on myself, I love hers. We had a talk and I told her pretty much where I didn't want her to get any mods, basically I want to see an ass not a tattoo, same with titties and face. She was cool with it and agreed and has told me a bunch of times \"if you think I'm going too far let me know and I'll stop.\" \n\nIt's all about communication, man.

      "text": "Hey OP, I\u2019m gonna throw my take at ya. I\u2019ve been reading the comments and there seems to be two camps: looks don\u2019t matter if you really love someone, and looks and sex are a foundation to a relationship.\n\nI think both of those things are true because I\u2019d like to point out that there are always more attractive people out there than your partner. There is always someone with a prettier smile, a smaller waist, less tattoos. But is YOUR gf your person? Does she get you? Does she make you feel like you don\u2019t have to be anything you are not? Do you feel loved, accepted, and that you can rely on this person if shit hits the fan and they will be there for you? These are things that are important to a lasting relationship. Is she as hot as someone else without tattoos? Probably not. But is everything else she offers worth walking AWAY from? Only you can decide that. \n\nIs being attracted to the person you are dating important in starting a relationship? Yes, very much so. Ask yourself: do you suddenly think she\u2019s hideous or ugly? Or can you compromise that she\u2019s gonna be as physically attractive as someone without those features (tattoos) but she\u2019s still a wonderful person and the person you wanna be with.\n\nMy advice: take a break from weed for a few days. Really ask yourself the questions that need asking and reflect on how attractive you find her as she is, right now. Maybe she went from a 10 to an 8 for example. Can stand to spend more time with someone who is an 8? Or maybe she is now a 3 and there is nothing else redeeming about the relationship. Then you will have your answer.",

I think what's important is not just *what* OP is feeling but ***why*** they're feeling it, which you elaborated on some questions for OP to ask themselves.\n\nIt's a big difference if she was a 10 and dropped to an 8 or 9 in his eyes vs suddenly dropping to a 3 and a deal breaker. in that case, there's also probably something there to unpack that OP has to figure out if he so easily can just have her drop from a 10 to a 3 just from lustfully editing her to not have tattoos in photoshop. If tattoos were ***that*** much of a deal breaker to begin with, there's no way somebody wouldn't already know that or have thoughts about it much earlier on in the relationship.",

I was expecting the same thing, because he loved my hair.  But it was so different, because he loved me for other reasons first, there was no shadow of resentment.  There are a lot of people that love tattoos, remember that by staying with her you are keeping her from finding someone who thinks her devotion to art is the sexiest thing she could have.

Would you break up with someone if they got a haircut you don't like? Just because there are ways she could be hotter doesn't mean she's not hot already. Everyone has flaws. Most people could have a thinner waist, a sharper jaw or nicer teeth. Very few people come close to \"physical perfection\". \n\nThe questions you have to ask yourself is \"is imperfection worth leaving someone you love over? Will you obsess over the ways your partner could be even more attractive to you then they already are?\".\nI'm not trying to guilt anyone into staying with anyone. If you just realized that a few tattoos are ok but you don't want to be with someone covered from head to toe you should deal with that. But you shouldn't overthink and create problems if there aren't really any.",

It's been 4 years and we are married now and I've literally never seen his face bare. It's HIS body and his body isn't \"mine\" to mold into my perfect little sex doll to play with.\n\nBUT it turns out that actually doesn't matter because I love him and he's sexy as hell to me beard or no beard because of the man he is inside and all the other parts of him I find insanely attractive. I'm sure at some point if he gained 100 lbs or started growing 10 foot fingernails or sprouted a prehensile tail, my sex drive would take a hit but that wouldnt diminish the love I have for him and wouldn't make me even consider leaving him over it. I would never even mention it unless he said \"Hey you don't seem to be as into sex as you used to be... How come?\" Even then I'd have a hard time telling him because I love him too much to hurt him.",

How do you pinpoint the cause of this when it's the result of a whole context? It's a challenging conversation to be started, and you wonder: Maybe this is all supposed to feel ok. Maybe you're exaggerating. Maybe he'll do something nice again soon that'll make you feel better. Maybe. So you just move on about with your day and ignore that feeling for now. \nThen the toothpaste cap that you've asked 879,643 times to be put on AND it's never on, is found off AGAIN. Now, you choose to start THIS conversation, after all, it's an easy and obvious issue to be solved. You hear back: \"It's just a toothpaste cap honey, chill.\" Now that's your trigger. It's not just about a toothpaste cap and in a whimp of frustration you finally shout that it's all about you feeling uncared for. That's how the CGL, aka the crazy girlfriend leap, happened. The men is stunned and wonders how did his sweet and rational girlfriend flip into a crazy girlfriend. And just over a toothpaste cap.\n\nThe fact is, if your man does other things that make you feel loved and happy, in the big scheme of things you couldn't care less about the toothpaste cap. It's an easy issue to be solved. You screw it back on. Done. Move on.\n\nI can't recall a single thing that annoys me on my men. I am sure that he does things differently from what I'd do or expect. But I don't mind and move on with my day feeling happy and fulfilled as he makes me feel. \n\nAnd, to be honest, if an unscrewed toothpaste cap is the price to pay to feel how happy and loved he makes me feel, damn it, I'd unscrew it myself every day. It was never about the toothpaste cap.",

But even if she was like \"fuck it, I'll stay fat.\" I wouldn't leave her bc, not to get too sappy here, I truly love her. And sure while I'm less attracted to her, I'm not completely not attracted to her.\n\nSo idk if that answers your question or not, hopefully it did.",

Being able to get it up isn't the biggest priority. The most picture perfect couple in the world has problems, what makes a good relationship is facing them together. That includes an occasion when one starts feeling less physically attracted to the other. It's not a one size fits all problem/solution either. Some couples get creative in finding a way to keep the bedroom spicy through other means, like trying out new things. Others just don't prioritize having sex as much. But sex is only one part of their lives and relationships, and it's the only one where physical attraction actually has an impact on being able to be partners.",

The level of morbid obesity reached by adding 250 pounds onto an average height frame decreases life expectancy by more than a decade and makes you much more susceptible to disability and illness. That should be treated on the same level as any other self-destructive behavior, like drug abuse. You didn't love any less genuinely if you show concern for their health decline, or if you eventually leave someone that's self-destructive and doesn't care that their lifestyle choices may leave you a widow/widower or a caretaker in the future.\n\nOn a personal level, I lost a close friend and roommate who was morbidly obese, and I loathe how real health crises get tied to toxic indicators of love. There's a huge difference between tactlessly micromanaging a partner's 30 lb weight swings, and 100+ lbs of weight gain, yet it all gets muddled into one big culture war of all or nothing",

I wasted my life having y'all and I wish I didn't have to deal with any of you.\" \n\nAnd even then, that's more polite than her wording. \n\nMost people who tout \"brutal honesty\" are mostly interested in the brutality.

Ofc it was a longer conversation than that, but this is what I can recall.

You can't really remove them (sure you can of course but that's a whole process)\n\nI have tattoos myself and don't mind someone with or without them but even then if that is something you are really not in to and they plan on covering a large portion of their body with them idk I just think that's a fair reason to lose attraction to someone.\n\nI really don't like the large piercings that people will have blowing out their ears. It's a gigantic turnoff for me and if my current girlfriend did that it would be a very big shock to me.\n\nIf I was asked I would tell her I find it incredibly unattractive and that I truly think it would alter how I see her permanently.\n\nBeing \"shallow\" is okay so long as everyone is upfront and ultimately okay with whatever. Idk if I define tattoos and permanent changes shallow if they're within that person's control. A haircut or maybe a few extra or less lbs sure but a permanent body change if you're upfront that you don't want them to do it and they decide to anyways is fair game to me.\n\nJust my opinion on the matter.",

Like, tattoos for me at least, makes one seem as if they were clothed, which is less attractive to me then if they weren't. \n\nOn the other hand, it's physical appearance and the majority thought is that it won't matter if they have tattoos or not if you truly love them. But sex drive genuinely can worsen due to things that wouldn't matter if you loved them or not, and certain things regarding sex are a deal or no deal for countless relationships. \n\nSex can play a major role in many relationships and if both parties aren't satisfied with how the other person looks to them I really struggle on seeing how that becomes their fault, or anyone's fault at all. \n\nLike, it's not using someone for sex. Just like you're not using someone for their personality. I wouldn't have sex with some jerk, but I could still find them attractive. However, I'd be much more inclined if someone were both my type and nice. \n\nReally I'm just confused.",

There's just some things people really don't like and at the end of the day the vast majority of us have our flaws.\n\nIt's like you said attraction shouldn't be the number one thing but if something changes that makes you unattractive to your partner especially a change you willingly made then idk it's fair but kinda meh.\n\nI think if you're upfront that hey if you get this big tattoo it's going to really bother me and I'm not going to be as attracted to you and they decide to go through with it anyways then it's fair if you don't want to be with that person because you aren't attracted to them. Especially if you're doing so because you know it isn't fair for you to feel that way.\n\nIt's okay to be shallow so long as everyone is upfront imo. Sure being shallow isn't a good thing but so long as it isn't toxic in nature then so be it.\n\nThere's just no right or wrong imo for a situation like that. Sure it's kinda dumb to leave a person based on tattoos but if you don't like them and they know and do it anyways then I don't see a problem with you breaking up with them. Both parties then know what the deal is.",

It just feels a little sad the need to give yourself pain to feel in control. I see new tattoos get added after friends break up with their partner, after bouts of depression, stressful life events, etc. it just doesn\u2019t seem good and people really hate when I notice the pattern because they think they\u2019re fine when really they are addicted to the endocrine response tattoos give them.",

I don't know enough about psychology to say what sort of foundation for your self esteem is healthy and what isn't. People also say getting buff made them more confident - that is definitely improving yourself, but doesn't necessarily mean they're not avoiding their inner issues.\n\nI wasn't really arguing for it being good or bad. Just had a thought and wrote it. \n\n> Also did you mean couch? \n\nYes I did, sorry, not a native speaker. \n\n> I think the term your looking for in that case is 'armchair psychology'\n\nPossibly, but I feel like couch psychology also works in the same way. It's even more laid back than an armchair :)",

Sometimes people grow apart and it doesn\u2019t mean anyone did anything wrong to instigate this change in us, however when I picture the future as I picture where we are both continuing in our individual life journeys, I realize that we are starting to grow in separate directions. And that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s no body\u2019s fault. And you deserve to find someone whose own journey is naturally growing more closely in the direction as yours. It\u2019s just unfair to you and to me to continue this relationship as it currently is, because you deserve 100% and I realize now I cannot give you that full 100% that you and I both at the very least deserve the chance to try and find that 100% person match, because I dont want to be selfish and drag this along while we figure out whether we should try to stick it out and risk wasting your time when you could be free to try and find that someone more compatible for you, who won\u2019t be a waste of your time. I hope you understand where I\u2019m coming from because you do deserve to be happy and to have the best; and I know that now with me, you will not receive all that you deserve in this relationship, and as much as it hurts me to have to make this decision to end things, I know it would be wrong to hold you back from seeking out that something thats even better out there waiting for you to find him. And when you do find the right one, he will never have these doubts about you two that I do about us, and he\u2019ll never have to have this conversation with you that we\u2019re having now.\u201d",

Before you went and digitally augmented your girlfriend\u2019s body you didn\u2019t seem to have any issue. \u201c10/10 body.\u201d The reason you feel guilty is because you made up some fantasy. You have no right to change her body IRL, and the morality of changing it digitally is a bit murky. \n\nSecondly, does this manifest in any tangible way? Does it change how much you care for her? Does it make you not want sex? What is causing your anxiety, that you won\u2019t be attracted to her in the future? It sounds to me like you are entertaining negative thoughts. That\u2019s a common symptom of anxiety/depression. You\u2019re making up a problem in your head. You need to figure out why that\u2019s happening, there may be more going on than you have unearthed yet. \n\nLast of all, I don\u2019t know how old you are or the nature of your relationship, but personally I have been with my wife for ten years, and married for 4. I\u2019m 31 now and my libido has changed many times over. Both of our bodies have changed many times over. My priorities have shifted many times over and what I find attractive has changed many times over. Nothing is permanent. Worry about the future when it get here man, because everything is changing all the time, and you can only ever deal with what\u2019s in front of you right now. \u2764\ufe0f",

But he does hold the right to have an opinion about her appearance and fashion choices, and the right to act on that opinion. It is not immoral to dislike the tattoos.\nAnd how is it immoral to edit her tattoos out of curiosity? It's the exact same as imagining her without them, and a man is entitled to his own thoughts. \n\n>The reason you feel guilty is because you made up some fantasy.\n\nThat is incredibly dismissive of his opinion, he is not obliged to like her tattoos because they are together. Disliking the tattoos is not \"some made up fantasy\", it is his personal opinion. He himself said that he always disliked the tattoos, he just hadn't internally verbalized it. This fact doesn't change the validity of those emotions. \n\n>does this manifest in any tangible way?\n\nIt manifests in that he realised he dislikes the tattoos. About your further points, sexual attraction is more than just about sex. \n\nHis opinion is valid, just because he realised it after a while doesn't make it not so.",

For example, it\u2019s very common for breasts to change shape or nipples to change color. They have no control over that whatsoever. These and other changes can happen without weight gain and are normal. A woman may be self conscious over that and deserves a supportive partner. \n\nEven if weight gain did result (definitely some lose the baby weight more easily than others) a partner who loves them will help them through that. Should you and your ever SO go through that, I hope your attitudes on the subject will evolve. \n\nThis discussion started when a guy observed that he and his wife\u2019s bodies changes over years, and they still lived each other the same.

They're at the point where they're realizing that they're going to have to settle down with someone they're not attracted to, entirely compatible with, or that have kids, because there's just not that many single people left.\n\nThe fact that you're with someone that you describe as 10/10 is not something to break off lightly. I get the no-tattoo preference, but is it really that big of a deal breaker on the big picture?",

What's the goal?...to not get her to get the tattoo? ...to make a case and convince him to see her and find her more attractive? Either way, she's still covered in a lot of tattoos and they're important to her in the long run.\n\nOP is struggling for one reason or another with the idea that he might not be as attracted as he thought to this girl. Although, tbh there could be more to it that we don't know or that he hasn't processed yet. \n\nI will say, the level of importance on this and the context of how the story is put out there makes me feel weird about it. OP said he's always though she was a 10/10 and that she has a great personality. Either he *thinks* he's been in love with her and isn't as in love as he once though or he's simply *lusting* over the fantasy of what she'd look like without tattoos...Part of me thinks his brain is clinging onto the second part of that, since this whole scenario sounds like it's based only on the physical side of things.\n\nLike, maybe talking about it could help, but I don't think there's much to communicate and resolve between the two. If he just don't find it attractive he doesn't, but if he simply is just lusting over the idea of no tattoos, then maybe he needs to get himself in check for what he wants for a relationship. Some people could take that and think he's reaching for reasons to find something wrong, but that's making assumptions.",

We\u2019ve been together for 11 years and physically we\u2019ve both changed in several ways, good or bad.

In the way that I\u2019m thinking about attraction I feel it really does matter and you can\u2019t really be in love with them without at least something attracting you to them. \n\nI am attracted to him regardless of imperfections or changes in his body. Yeah, I have preferences but not having those all the time doesn\u2019t make him unattractive. I don\u2019t care that he never got braces as a child or when he puts on a little weight. He has lovely eyes and gives the best hugs. He makes me laugh and his come hither look still gives me butterflies. \n\nAre the tattoos a deal breaker for OP? If so, he should leave. Is it something he doesn\u2019t really care for but he\u2019s still attracted to her even with the tattoos making her not on a total 10 in his book? That\u2019s something for consideration.",

They can be great for being flexible and open to different ways of thinking. Or for example if they realise they're wrong after hearing a different perspective they will say so straight up. That's healthy. The first type are more likely to take way longer to do this by contrast. \n\nThey can also be \" every which way the wind blows\" people which means can be flaky and don't really know their own mind ie what they want or what they like (at worst) as it changes all the time.\n In a relationship with them it's hard as it's like \"do you want to be with me or do you not\"? Hard to keep up with someone being a yo yo.\n\nRegardless if really want to change, need  to remind yourself of what is important to you and assess everything from that angle each time ( if talking partners). Eg confidence, kindness, if looks then whatever looks criteria is important to you, career, friends, how you talk to people, respect, how they make you feel in stress situations etc \nThese are just ideas so you say \"ok this is what's important to me so is this still true about my partner?\"\n If so yay I'm not falling out of love today.\nIf no then boooo its breakup day. \nI'm being flippant obviously.\n\nIt's hard with this guy as it's about how attractive he found his Photoshopped gf compared to Real gf. Attraction can be based on all sorts of factors. It is subjective. In this case he's saying it's looks ( tattoos specifically). Maybe it's other factors too but he can't pin point them.\nOr next week he realises this was a short term crazy and he is attracted to the person she is above everything else. Who knows?",

Be it their smile, eyes, something more sexual, or just something they like. \n\nI don't think having an aesthetic preference is immature or selfish. I think that those can sneak up on you and even surprise you with what can be a deal breaker. \n\nAs harsh as it may sound the majority of people have aesthetic lines they won't compromise on. For a healthy relationship usually both aesthetic and personality needs should be met. \n\nThere are of course exceptions to every rule but by and large personal appearance matters to the majority of partners to some level and if their SO either changed something incredibly drastically or had something happen that relationship can be impacted because of that.",

Then let her decide from there how she wants to handle it if she wants to probe deeper and get the brutal honest truth out of them she should have that choice or she should have the choice to you OK this relationship is at Best in a rut at worst failing is there anything I can do to become more attractive or is it just some thing that isn\u2019t working anymore and then she can decide to cut her losses and break up with him based on that but there\u2019s no reason for him to go into excruciating detail and pinpointing every single flaw that he perceives in her. That just feels equally cruel",

Editing nudes of your girlfriend - WHO OP SAYS HAS REALLY INTENSE BODY DYSMORPHIA PROBLEMS - without asking her is really inconsiderate behaviour, even if you\u2019re not doing it to remove something integral to their identity to \u201csee what they would look like without it\u201d. \n\nI think that OP\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d that her attraction to her girlfriend will fade is extremely weird and reflects a lack of boundaries regarding her partner\u2019s appearance and her partner\u2019s autonomy. Again, OP repeats that she is incredibly attracted to her girlfriend, but just maybe not to the tattoos - you don\u2019t get to pick and choose with people. \n\nMy stance throughout this has been that the people telling OP to \u201ctalk to her gf\u201d or \u201ctry to find a compromise\u201d are doing OP and OP\u2019s gf a disfavour by essentially prompting OP to make OP\u2019s weird problems with her gf\u2019s tattoos into her girlfriend\u2019s problem, by dumping a bunch of feelings she has about unchangeable things on her girlfriend\u2019s body onto her girlfriend. As someone with tattoos, that is likely to do a lot of damage. You don\u2019t need to tell your partner when you decide something about them is unattractive to you unless it\u2019s actually productive to do so - this would not be productive at all.\n\nI truly think that OP should break up with her girlfriend if the tattoos thing is really a deal breaker, not try to \u201ctalk to\u201d her gf about this. But I also think that if OP is that exacting in her opinions about her partner\u2019s body, she\u2019s going to find other problems with her future partners as well. So she should stay or leave, but not stay and try to \u201ccompromise\u201d as so many people have suggested.\n\nOkay great, you can stop arguing with me because you actually agree with me and just made my point for me.",

There\u2019s been times when she aggressively hit the gym, times when she hasn\u2019t. Through all of these looks, I have never once not been deeply attracted to her. I\u2019ve always found her to be beautiful and sexy, even when she doesn\u2019t. The reason is because I\u2019m in love with her. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m a better person, or that you\u2019re shallow, or that you don\u2019t love you girlfriend. I\u2019m just saying I\u2019ve never thought that my wife would be more attractive if she changed xyz, and thay I take it as a sign that you need to keep looking if you\u2019re this shaken by the tattoos.",

Why is this this tattoo thing a sudden threat for a *deal-breaker*. If she was a 10/10 before, did she drop to an 8 or 9? or did she drop to a 3/10 somehow after just this one revelation? If it's a 7,8, or 9, why is *that* a deal-breaker for you? I would think if it dropped low enough like a 3, there's maybe something more there that we aren't seeing or that you don't realize yet.\n* Is this something that will go away or will it stay with you? To me, on the outside, it sounds more of a lustful discovery that you're fixating on, (that's fine to discover that about yourself) but it is something that you won't ever move on from or is it something that is taking over your brain because it's simply something you don't have? (Kind of like the whole 'the brain wants what it can't have' type of thing).\n* How is your relationship itself doing? Outside of this instance, are you two actually doing good mentally, emotionally, and physically? Is there something within the relationship making things more appealing to think about what you don't have with this girl?\n* **Most importantly**, how are ***you*** doing in general? I looked at your past posts and comment history and I saw you've been going through some stuff, at least over the past year or so with mental health and depression(?). Sometimes those things can play a role in your reasoning for different situations. Whether it's irrational thinking, numbness to situations, or maybe downgrading your positive regard for things you appreciated more before.\n\nI think a lot of people make assumptions on reddit and also read into things to project from their self experiences, but I hope you can look toward the 'why' for the reasoning on what your brain is telling you and where your fears and concerns are coming from.\n\nIf it's simply a matter of genuinely not being able to do a relationship with someone who has tattoos because you don't like it, then that's okay if it's truly what you want for yourself...but don't fuck it up for the sake of your brain going through a moment, if that's what it is instead.",

Will you want to fuck the same person in 20 years or in 40 years or are you only thinking about now?  Imagine having sex with someone who's 68.\n\nIf you're only thinking about now then you're not actually thinking about having a long term relationship you're just thinking about fucking.\n\nIt's hard to argue that you can truly love someone so long as the primary condition for that love is that they make you horny enough.  No one is that hot for that long in anyone's mind enough to put up with all the other struggles that's involved in dating marriage etc.",

This is why sex is often better and more frequent early in a relationship.\n\nSo basically, it's not that you're necessarily turned off by tattoos- it could easily be that seeing an alt version of your girlfriend is just really exciting to you. Try photoshopping her hair or eyes a different color, put her in a French maid outfit, etc. You may find it's not \"no tattoos\", it's just \"different\"",

And nobody should change themselves and deny their passion because of another person, which could be temporary. The tattoos are more permanent than you might be so she will choose that tattoos. \nThe way this is heading it will not work out. I feel that the only way is to tell her how you feel, and potentially you two can come to a compromise. Because so far she has no idea that you hate her tattoos. I'm sure she's super excited about her big tattoos coming in, but if she wants to be with you too, she might rethink her designs and placements. Maybe even get you on board with some designs who knows. But don't sit there accepting the situation.

I was badly burned by pulling a saucepan of boiling sauce off the stove onto myself as a 4yo and I had to wear a burn suit for 12 months. For some weird reason my mind associates drawing on my skin with being burned and I've never even been able to stand a spot of pen on my hand. I find tattoos really unattractive because of my own issues.",

You wouldn't dump her or have a problem just because she isn't hotter than them, right? So why do so now? Think of them as 2 women. One you aren't with (tattooless) and one you are . You wouldn't leave or cheat on her because someone else happens to be cuter, right? So why do this?\n\nSounds like you know that you want out or are suddenly afraid and you're finding excuses that are not really issues. Stay or leave, but sounds so far like she would be better off if you left since something so ridiculous like this could change your mind and up end her life.

You need to figure out if the relationship is of a more physical nature or more emotional. You need to do some self reflection and find out why you're so opposed to tattoos. \n\nDoes it come from a need to control? A lot of people are more controlling than they think. Especially when other problems in life are out of your control. Mental issues can pop up without you realizing until someone tells you. You can't really work on it if you don't know about it. \n\nIt is ultimately her body. She can do with it what she wants. Just like your body is yours. If you want to put a hole in the side of your face, you can. There is a piercing that does that. \n\nYou also need to tell her. You have to sit down and explain yourself to her in a setting that makes both of you comfortable. Don't accuse her of anything just tell her what you said here. Hiding this is only going to make things worse in the long run. She will eventually find out. \n\nYou need to address this with her. Maybe therapy can help. We all have issues, there's no shame in it. It could just mean that maybe your relationship isn't meant to be as well. Again, there's no shame in that. One of the questions you have to ask yourself is are you happy in the relationship in every other way than with the tattoos before you talk to her. I bet that's going to be a question she asks in the discussion. You need to have a well thought out answer for it. Tell her that you thought about it before talking to her.",

But my current boyfriend doesn't have any tattoos and I love it so fucking much I cannot even express it. If he ever got a tattoo I would probably cry for days. I still think tattoos are interesting and I don't think there's anything wrong with having tattoos, but I feel like the look of unmarked skin has become really undervalued. If my boyfriend got a tattoo, whenever I looked at that part of his body all I would see is the tattoo, when now I get to look at that part of his body and see him with no distractions. The lack of interference makes his naked skin so much more sexual to me. I hope he never gets tattooed, but I respect that it's his body.and his choice.",

Attraction is important, but, eventually you'll both be saggy bags of meat hung on a protruding bone robot.  This is where love comes in, because neither of you will see the other that way.  \nYou'll still see that hot tattoo artist with whom you feel in love so long ago.  Beauty is subjective and takes on different shapes as we age.  It matures.  At 40, I can't say I see anyone \"Ugly\" or \"unattractive\" anymore.  I see what the sum of my experience tells me to see.  \nWhat you are doing is overthinking with the wrong brain and its going to sabatoge your relationship.  Anyone's significant other looks more attractive when placed through the lens of photoshop.  I'm pretty sure South Park did an episode on that topic.  Here's a thought experiment.   Think of exciting life news, then imagine you are in front of your gf in each state.  Tattoos & no tattoos.  Do you want to share your exciting news any less with one or the other?  Of course not.  When you love someone, you want to share your life with them regardless.  I encourage you to define your relationship by more than how attracted you are to them.  This will eb and flow over the course of a relationship.   Good luck!",

      "text": "Oh man I can relate\u2026\n\nThis is purely anecdotal evidence, but I recently split with a long term partner who had a number of tattoos. \nI don\u2019t hate tattoos, but I think that, with a few small or subtle exceptions, they tend to detract from a girl\u2019s natural beauty.\nMy girl had a few that I actually liked, but the effect of so many of them together was unattractive to me, and she kept getting more. She knew I wasn\u2019t really 100% into them, so it was always a point of passive aggressive tension. She couldn\u2019t get rid of the ones she already had, and she would want to get new ones and I found it difficult to be supportive and honest at the same time. I also saw a photo of her once before I knew her as a teenager without them and had that sinking feeling where I recognized on a deep level that I would be much more attracted to her without them, or at least without as many as she had.\nNow I\u2019m not going to say something absurd such as her having tattoos meant our relationship was doomed to not last. But looking back, it could be a sort of analogy to other deep but subtle problems there. One where in the back of my mind I wasn\u2019t fully happy with who she was, or where she didn\u2019t feel fully supported and loved by me to be who she was. That sounds extreme, but even little gaps in the armor there can grow if they have roots.\nNext relationship I will personally be less dismissive of these little gut feelings I get and more attentive to if things \u201cclick\u201d, as opposed to seeing how many of my boxes I can check on some ideal partner checklist that exists in my head. \nHaving said all this\u2026 if I was picking two girls out of a lineup I was equally attracted to, one with a couple of interesting small tattoos and one with none\u2026 I would still be tempted to opt for the girl with some tattoos because that would signal to me greater chance of a personality I would like more. Even though I don\u2019t have tattoos, I do think a girl having one has a higher (but not definite) chance of being more free spirited, artistic, less conventional and uptight, and more sexually open and liberated. \nWho knew this post would make me think on this level? Thanks for sharing.",

You're doing the right thing in terms of realizing that it's ultimately her choice and you're not trying to actively discourage her. But you should definitely talk before her next big project. For all you know, she could be more into you than the tattoos. Or maybe she thinks you're into them, or maybe, just maybe, after talking, no matter what happens, at least you are on the same page.\n\nGood luck!",

On the other hand, and this may be controversial, I'm wondering about speaking up against the tattoo. Obviously it's her choice, but doesn't she deserve to know what the possible outcome will be for your relationship? She might decide she values that more than the tattoo.  \nIf you speak up or break up after getting it, you'll have robbed her of a choice in the matter.",

I don\u2019t necessarily need his permission but I need his acceptance of my decision. The same goes for him. He would never drastically change his body without talking it over with me first. \n\nYou are in a partnership with this woman. Be honest and tactful with her. Tell her what you did. How you are struggling with it. Focus on you and your emotions about the situation. Tell her your realization of how you appreciate her body without the artwork. Stress how you understand that the artwork is part of her. You need to be honest and forthcoming with her. If not this will fester and destroy your relationship.\n\nOne of the best things I\u2019ve ever heard about tattoos is that a great tattoo just defines something that was already there.",

Then I got into my most serious relationship and it bothered the hell out of me when she wanted her first tattoo. (Something the size of a silver dollar on her wrist.) But I got over it. She would go on and on about wanting so many more and it was like a gut punch. I never told her she \"couldnt\" get more because who the fuck controls their person like that? Definitely not the guy I saw myself to be. But I dropped enough hints that it caused fights. What I was doing was definitely moderately manipulative though I didn't realize it at the time. Eventually we split and I dated several women casually over the next few years and all of them were considerably more tatted than my ex. Then Something clicked, I didn't hate tattoos...my mom hates tattoos and I was pretty much indoctrinated to be averse to then myself. I love tattoos. They're artistic and sexy and a means of self expression and oftentimes I was the only person getting to see them in their entirety because I was the boyfriend and I got to see these women naked. Others could see it peaking out on bare skin but I got to see all of them, lay in bed and trace my finger over them, it's awesome. Now I'm married to a woman with a handful and our first date was a weekend in Dallas where I picked the artist and paid for a large forearm piece. I love them, and I see them as a part of the person they're etched on and their story. Hell I have one nyself. The thing is, if you sit here and dwell on this, you will hurt her self esteem, your attraction for her, and your relationship. If you convince yourself you don't want someone with tattoos it doesn't matter how much you love her, it's a door in your head that you shut. It's up to you how to proceed, but if you had a good relationship, connection, and sex life before, then this shouldn't matter. My wife has gained probably 20 pounds since we first met, and while she is definitely not fat, she is softer in places she didn't used to be. Would I be like \"Holy shit!\" If she lost it and got back to being a gym rat? Absolutely. Hype up your person all the time. But do I think less over her because her physical appearance has shifted? Absolutely not. She's still the tatted bombshell I married and I love her like crazy. Bottom line, this is all about you and how you choose to move forward. Don't hurt her in the process. Especially because from the sound of it, there's thousands of guys that would drag their dicks through broken glass to be on the receiving end of those pictures, if I was unmarried, present company included.",

I understand if you're nervous talking to her, but it's unfair that the world gets to know how you feel about her before she does. It's one thing to feel it every now and then, it's another to go out of your way and change up your positions in bed because you don't want to see her tattoos. It also seems like there's no stopping her from getting more tattoos. If this is a turn off, why are you still with her? \n\nI myself, am tattooed. So when I hear someone is complaining about their partner getting more tattoos and they weren't ready for it DESPITE how much communication was put in place beforehand, is pathetic. Don't be with someone if they don't tick all your boxes. It sounds like you're settling, because if you really love her, tattoos wouldn't matter. Especially if she had a good amount before dating you.",

It's also just as much your own right to have an opinion about whether or not it's attractive. You sound like you have some shame and guilt issues around having your own opinion about attractiveness that don't mesh with her own, and that in itself seems like it could be a bit problematic for you in life.  \n\nIf you take some time to think things through and you come out of it feeling confident that the tattoos really are an issue for you, there's nothing wrong with having an honest conversation about the way you feel. Frame it from the point of view of your own feelings rather than her own \"shortcomings\" or the like.

Accept life for what it is and accept your loved ones for what they are.

I cannot say this loudly enough.  I understand that you are concerned about talking to her about it because of her body image issues and her excitement about getting the new tattoo, however, not talking to her about how you feel is basically dishonest in my opinion and you're not giving her the chance to respond to that discussion, instead you're making the decisions for her without her even knowing it.\n\nTalk to her at a time and in a place of calmness, let her know how you feel about the tattoos and ESPECIALLY how you feel about the new one she is planning to get.  Let her know that you find it personally unattractive and then let her decide what she wants to do about that, as is her right as an adult.\n\nEveryone has things that \"turn them off\", and sometimes people don't realize what those things are until they come across them.  This is apparently a pretty profound one for you that you're just discovering, and you should be up front with her, and an adult with her, about it.",

If youve been together for decades it loses importance but even then you are programmed to respond to visual stimuli. Don't let anyone shame you for being human.\nWhat's important is determining what your priorities are and what you can/can't live without.\nWhat else makes your relationship worthwhile? Is this thing important enough that losing all of that wouldn't fill you with regret and longing? Furthermore is the idea that she'd be more attractive without tattoos an indicator that she isn't attractive with tattoos at all or just less so?\nDo you need her in your life? Do you love her?\nWhat is this relationship about?\nTo add to this I'd say it is unavoidable that you speak with her openly.\nYou are right in saying that's its not your place to ask her not to get inked any further because it isn't. This is her decision. But since you are in a relationship it is important that she knows your actual stance on this. Secrets are dangerous.\nFind the strength to talk to her, make sure to emphasize that you do not wish to weigh in on her decision-making but having a hard time with this.\nIf she knows you well she will understand. What she does with it is up to her.",

My partner is 10 years younger then me but she has had a couple children from another relationship so her body is not the type that I would not be attracted to. I've come to the realization that as we get older, our bodies hold much less significance then they did when I was younger. My own body, although has not changed too much, does not attract attention like I could sense when I was younger.\n\nWe still make love and show our affection, but it is different. I think it has to be different. \n\nI guess my point is that the youthful attraction does not last, but the love does. I think what you need to do is to examine why you are with this person now. Is it for the feelings or for the physical attraction. If it is for the physical attraction only, then you might have some difficulty in the future when you look around and you are not person you were on the outside.\n\ngood luck, I hope you find your path, no matter how it goes.

Why isn\u2019t it okay for people to lose attraction or dislike their partner\u2019s choices? \n\nWhether the post is real or not, it seems to be polarising people into those that are emphatically defending tattoos and those that hate them. \n\nI\u2019m neither a tattoo lover or a hater, but my ex had many of them and eventually asked for a brutally honest opinion about them - which I gave. Not every tattoo is a great idea and I don\u2019t know why *some* people with them need that validation and we have to be like, \u201coh WOW thanks for showing me your tattoos. That rose on the back your hand, the Roman numerals, the skull with a clock beside it, the random *hiragana* and tribal markings. They\u2019re all super original and interesting.\u201d\n\n> You don\u2019t get to make decisions about what looks better or worse about her body. \n\nRight. And you don\u2019t get to make decisions about whether or not someone wants to stay in a relationship because of their personal choices. Would you date someone who had 11 Winnie the Pooh tattoos on their face? Genuinely asking.\n\n> And above all you NEVER EVER EVER EVER fixate on something your partner can\u2019t change, like their height, age, race, etc., etc.\n\nWoah, slow down a bit here. Height, age and race(!??) are not comparable with deciding to get a tattoo. Height and age are factors that might determine how attracted you are to a person, but they generally wouldn\u2019t affect your feelings to someone when you are in a relationship. This is false equivalence at its finest. \n\nTattoos are preferences for the people who have them, but also the people they\u2019re with. Yes, personality and emotional connection are more important than aesthetics, but we shouldn\u2019t act like physical attraction is insignificant.",

              "text": "If the tattoos are already there, she\u2019s already chosen them, and you can\u2019t complain about them being there. If she is a tattoo artist and getting more, she is choosing to continue for both her work and her study, and you can\u2019t complain about her choice if that\u2019s what she is going to do. \n\nMy spouse has many tattoos all over their body. I did most of them. Would I date someone with ugly tattoos? I have and would, because I\u2019m not dating someone\u2019s skin, I\u2019m dating their brain and personality. Would I date someone with a burned face? Would I date someone with a missing ear? Would I date someone who chose to stretch their earlobes and shave their eyebrows and black-out their hands? Sure, if they were smart and relaxed and liked to talk about books and animals. \n\nUgly tattoos are a shame, but so are ugly hairstyles and ugly makeup. \n\nI am not saying OP (who\u2019s a lady, btw) should or shouldn\u2019t stay in the relationship if she doesn\u2019t like her partner\u2019s tattoos, but if that\u2019s a deal breaker for some reason, she needs to determine if she wants to break up over this. I\u2019ve broken off a 5 year relationship over having theoretical future kids (I was the person who didn\u2019t want them). It was a thing we couldn\u2019t budge on, so we broke up. \n\nMy point is if OP really feels strongly about tattoos and can\u2019t get past it, it\u2019s better to break up than attempt to control her partner or complain or shame her into feeling bad or not getting more tattoos.",

It sounds like this has been brewing for a little bit, based on when you talk about your feelings about her future tattoo plans.\n\nPhysical attraction is definitely a thing. It comes first and it's part of physical love. You two aren't married, you're not 20+ years into a relationship, so anyone who says you're being shallow or tries to shame you is being unhelpful.\n\nI would take this as an opportunity to have an honest conversation with your girlfriend. Don't start with the Photoshop realization, but do tell her that you've realized that you love the parts of her that aren't inked because she seems more naked and that makes it more intimate. \n\nYou've said that it's her choice what she puts on her body, but if you two are really truly serious about each other, she should take your wishes into consideration. If she doesn't see why, ask her honestly how she might feel if you (for example) tattooed your whole face black, injected red ink into your eyeballs and split your tongue. Would she still feel as attracted to you?\n\nThere's definitely a path forward from here, hopefully you two can have that real conversation.",

The human form is already a piece of art, and one we are specifically sexually attracted to.   \n\n \n\nRegarding the op in particular, he knew she had tattoos, but he only now learns that he is not attracted to tattoos during sex, It's perfectly valid to leave her over this.",

The thing about tattoos is that they are so far off from human skin color that if done too much the person looks like they have lizard skin or something.

So while some people may be into a tattooed look I bet 99.9% wouldn't date someone that had full body tattoos.  It's an acquired taste on not something that a person should assume their partner would be ok with.  And it's also done on purpose as opposed to an injury or whatever.",

As is readily evident by the number of tattooed people who have SOs. They're actually hard to find single because they're snatched up as soon they become available. People linger on the edges of their friend groups waiting for someone like the OP to fuck up.\n\nAnd all this is based on whether he finds her attractive. It's quite an assumption that the OP is attractive now. For all we know, the reason having sex doggie style is better is because she doesn't have to look at him and so actually gets into it. Maybe she's just putting up with his unattractiveness because she thinks he's a good guy. Hopefully OP breaks up with her and she finds someone better.",

Neither of us ever plan on \"letting ourselves go\" and we both continue to try to be attractive for the the other person. Physical attraction is very important for a long term, romantically sexual relationship, because it's hard to be sexually attracted to your partner if you're not *physically attracted* to your partner. \n\nFurther, taking care of yourself: staying fit and healthy, naturally makes a person look better overall, regardless of how old they are or how able-bodied they may be, and taking care of yourself in that way adds to your attractiveness, so it's not 100% purely looking young and hot.\n\nOf course if you and your partner don't plan on keeping your relationship sexual, then it's obviously less of a concern.",

I tell him, just get hair plugs, but he insists on paying the rent instead. Won't make his hands look nice because his arthritis hurts. If he'd just get out of his wheelchair and went for a run every so often he'd get buff and attractive, but there's always some excuse from his degenerating discs in his back to the doctor telling him he needs another knee surgery.

To me that means you also (whether you want to admit it or not) fell in love with her tatts.\n\nIf you're having such a huge problem with this you really need to get some counseling and work through what the issues are that you're facing.\n\nOr break up with her.\n\nBut do one or the other sooner than later.

I realized then that I would be way more attracted to her if she didn't have tattoos, and she would often say how she wants to get a hell of a lot more and I'd be pretty sad at the thought... But obviously wouldn't object, it made her happy and she clearly loved it. In the two years we were together she got 4 new tattoos, she was planning to get a sleeve and a bunch of stuff I don't remember...\n\nAnyways, she cheated on me and that's the end of that story!

As a GenX who watched them become popular in the 90s, it is striking to watch Mtv before the early 90s ... you expect all the singers to have them but they all look like fresh faced graduates. They really were rare - only people from prison or military or foreign tribes had them, or street junkies. Almost nobody on TV did - I am pretty sure it got popular from the street-heroin chic that came with grunge. But I also think lip and huge ear piercings are pretty ugly too. I think overall it has not been good for society - lots of people got infections and deformities from following these trends that never would have, and many were likely drawn into a way of life they may have avoided otherwise.",

If any of those things aren't widely varied then its pretty pointless as the studies would innately be flawed.  \n\n\nHowever, if you have evidence that can be provided from multiple sources, with wide variety to help agree with your statement then Id be perfectly willing to look into them.  \n\n\nThat being said, I can immediately disprove that men aren't attracted to tattoos as they have been in various ancient cultures as forms of art for millennia. Favorite example: Henna tattoos. Both temporary and permanent have been used in Egypt, West Asia, basically all of Africa, and the Indian subcontinent for close to 5000 years. They wouldn't be part of those cultures if people didn't find it attractive. In fact, in most of the cultures mention that did the tattoos, they were primarily used by women.",

If you want to argue that your area doesnt, then sure that may be the case, but I can almost 100%  guarantee that the people in the studies mentioned were specifically chosen to represent those studies to prove a biased perspective. Theres too many examples of both men and women getting tattoos to attract people.\n\nHeck, go to a strip club, presumably where people go to see attractive people naked, and tell me how many strippers arent sporting at least a small tattoo. Or to a burlesque show. A dance club. Literally anywhere that people hook up that isnt some sort of christian orthodox speed dating setup and youll find that people not only have tats, but also find others who have them attractive.\n\nTldr; the precsident is now and everywhere. People just dont look for things they dont find attractive and have all sorts of personal biases they use to 'prove it'",

If you can't discuss this how will you discuss medical, financial or other problems? Relationships are complex. Consider it good practice.

Not to mention it sounds like her tattoos are already impacting the relationship for you so maybe you're best off breaking up with her sooner rather than later because you already know you don't like them and that she's going to get more.

And what happens when any of this stuff happens to YOU and your spouse maybe isn\u2019t as attracted to you in the same way as when you met?\n\nIt\u2019s good that you are questioning, but ask yourself whether you love and are attracted to the person, don\u2019t sweat the body stuff. If you found a person that you can love and that loves you back, don\u2019t throw that away because of how they want to decorate their body. If you haven\u2019t found that person, be glad you figured it out now.",

I loved her, I loved her body, everything about her.\n\nThen she got a tattoo of her grandmother telling her she loved her (traced the note).\n\nIt was on her collarbone, and I didn't mind it, because not only did it look nice, it was also incredibly sentimental to her.\n\nShe was, and still is, incredibly into piercing. She was piercing herself at the age of 15. She was telling me her plans about it, and I sternly told her I don't find it attractive. I mean, right now she has gauges, her bellybutton, 3 nose rings, and a tongue web ring (not anymore, it fell out just the other day.) I actually am still quite serious about this, but a lot more lax now that I realized it was coming from a place of control.\n\nTo be fair, if she did get 13 more face piercings, yeah, I wouldn't like it, but ultimately its up to her.\n\nAs for tattoos, due to this obsession with piercing, she started working at a tattoo parlor as an apprentice piercer. As she got along with the guys, the tattoo artist would give her free tattoos as practice. She got waves on her (before this). She got a buddha hand. She got a huge thigh piece.\n\nAt first, I hated it all. It really came down to the beginning of our relationship being unhealthy. I was still battling some demons from previous relationships, and I found myself fighting with her over what she could or couldn't do with her body.\n\nI hated the thigh piece, I hated that she wanted more. I have nothing against tattoos, I have two small ones. But her covering up the things I loved about her made me angry.\n\nThis is something we never really had a discussion about, but considering how unhealthy this sounds, we had to talk a lot about our relationship.\n\nAnd as time grew, and I grew up, I realized that I just didn't give a fuck. Again, not my body, she's her own person. She can do whatever she wants. I started to love the tattoos on her. That huge thigh piece can get me horny just looking at it. I can imagine her being incredibly hot with the tattoos that she also wants.\n\nIm still steadfast on the piercings. I dont want her face to be a pincushion. But shes more than welcome to do whatever she wants as long as she doesnt go crazy overboard and she knows that. \n\nI guess what I'm trying to get to OP, is to do some inner reflection. Is this a complete deal breaker? Can you grow? Is this a means of control, or the feeling of losing control? Or is this simply just how you feel?",

If somebody looks more like a Stan Lee comic then it might be hard to want to bust to that as much, naturally.\n\nEdit: maybe if you don\u2019t already know, try learning about her stories for each tattoo. Maybe they carry a meaning that can help you appreciate them more.",

If it was her playing a \"girl next door\" kind of role as a fantasy would that bridge the gap for you? Then it could be about having some variety and fantasy rather than hating her tattoos (which you don't seem to, you just seem to really get off on bare skin, which, I don't blame you it's why i'm not tattooed).",

He has indeed gotten more stupid tattoos and he looks messy. It's very unattractive. I, as well as OP, am not into heavily inked people. I love the sight of bare skin. I do appreciate tattoos as art and some of them are real masterpieces. I just wouldn't date or marry someone who has his entire body covered in ink. \n\nI understand how OP feels, but I think he has to make up his mind 'cause this is a huge deal. His gf won't stop getting tattoos. Most tattoo artists are covered in them. If he's feeling thrown off about her ink, maybe her getting more ink will turn him off completely and he'll still have to end the relationship at some point because of his lack of attraction towards her. \n\nI also think it's better if he openly speaks to her about his feelings now. Even if her feelings get hurt, she will respect his honesty.",

People are allowed to have opinions, but as we all know, opinions and the internet do not always mix well. Very much like water and oil. \n\nI have always struggled with my self confidence and body image. I am a bigger girl, and I have some medical and genetic issues that keep me from being the \"skinny minnie\" I always thought I had to be to be attractive. Now... Everyone reading this may not like this, but, the truth is, attractiveness is subjective, and beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However, that is definitely not the most important part of the relationship. It helps, but it isn't the most important part.   \n\n\nI am marrying my fiance in a little more than a month. His physique isn't exactly what I imagined I would end up with, but I was more attracted to his personality than anything. He has continually supported me, and I couldn't imagine my life without him. We're also in an open relationship! Super cool! All this to say. If she's the right person, the tattoos are the last thing you are going to worry about. Good luck.",

He was understandably upset, he even went as far as to tell me that he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s attracted to me anymore but it passed. He realised it was just his knee jerk reaction. We\u2019re still together, I now have 3 face tattoos, full sleeve, both hands, palm & stomach tattoos & he loves them because they are a part of me. He isn\u2019t against tattoos as has many himself but just face ones, he\u2019s not keen on. \n\nMoral of the story, I think you know that you aren\u2019t feeling the same towards her as you used too. It doesn\u2019t have to be about her tattoos or body image at all, people can just simply lose feelings unfortunately :( so take some time to think about it & if you still feel the same, I\u2019d just tell her you don\u2019t feel the same way anymore. There\u2019s no stand out reason, you\u2019ve just grown apart. Then she won\u2019t end up feeling self conscious & you\u2019ll probably feel like a huge weight has been lifted & you can both move on! Cause no offence, if you get with a tattoo artist, you can expect them to be covered head to toe.",

His thoughts/feelings/concerns are absolutely valid, as are hers.).  \n\nPersonally I see nothing wrong with person A giving up something they like for the relationship, as long as both agree (free of duress).  \n\nIt's a great deal better than the flip side of - that of person A asking person B to do something they are not comfortable with for the sake of the relationship.  Nothing toxic about giving up something for someone though there is for asking someone to do something they are not comfortable with....  but adults are adults so it's not really even reddit worthy to be honest.\n\nHell, its downright therapeutic depending on the person, their relationship and life aptitude, and situation (insert reference to Lent or similar practices in other religions)",

I strongly discouraged her from getting tattooed, I tell her when she\u2019s visibly gaining weight. One time she brought up getting a pixie cut and I destroyed her for it.\n\n\nWithin reason, you should expect your partner to want to look good for you. Be vocal, be an advocate for yourself. Light bullying is extremely effective if your partner cares about your opinion. When I tell my girl she\u2019s gaining weight, she gets really sad and cries. I feel bad too. But not as bad as we\u2019d both feel if she got fat and I left her. I\u2019m not dating no fat bitch. We\u2019ve agreed on this, that neither of us wants to end up out of shape and unhealthy like our parents.\n\n\nThe man\u2019s happiness is more important than the woman\u2019s happiness for the sake of the relationship. Full stop. I know Reddit servers are overheating just from me typing those words, but they\u2019re right. Women don\u2019t know how to make themselves happy. Men do. I have to be charming, rich, in shape. I have to have a plan for our household, our family. I\u2019m the captain of the team. I make the money. I make the big decisions. Thank god I do, or else she\u2019d still be a mess without any idea where she\u2019s going.\n\n\nIf you offer a women a happy life on your team, and she wants to wear the jersey, it\u2019s your job to keep her in shape and ready for game nights. If you lose attraction, you\u2019re gonna cheat and it\u2019s gonna blow up. If you prioritize your happiness, and you offer her a life that she wants to be a part of, the relationship will work.",

I could tolerate a few small ones if they were absolutely out of the way and meaningful but that\u2019s about it.\n\nAnyways\u2026yeah, man, that blows. But at least now you know? You\u2019re only gonna learn more and more what it is you need in a woman, and if tattoos are a deal breaker then that\u2019s it.\n\n*side note: could I deal with someone with acne, stretch marks, etc?

              "text": "Any girl I've dated with tattoos rarely thought about the long term consequences of getting ink. They would get it on their hands, neck, face etc, often purely out of impulse without any real thought towards what was being drawn on their bodies, or where. It had a direct impact on their future employment prospects. The impulsivity of it often gave me cause for concern too. Many of those same girls cheated just because it 'felt good' at the time. I'm not saying I don't like inked girls, clearly I do. I just don't trust them long term. But this is from personal experience, and everyone's mileage will vary.",

Thats a lot to build a relationship on. I\u2019ve been married 35 years together 38. Neither of us looks like we once did. I always liked skinny girls but I have no expectation she\u2019d stay skinny. That\u2019s very rare. But I don\u2019t care about that. What I care about is the life we\u2019ve built, the great wife, mother, and grand mother she is. She\u2019s been my rock all this time and I\u2019m so thankful for her. I\u2019m not trying to say looks don\u2019t matter and you can\u2019t have preferences.  But at some point those preferences on looks alone won\u2019t get you home in a relationship. Think about her as a person. Is this someone that makes you a better person and one you make a better person? Are they caring, kind, empathetic? And are you attracted to her as she is? If those are a go I\u2019d think long and hard before throwing it away over tattoos. Just mho. Good luck.",

Although a person's appearance may not be the most important aspect of a person, it is how you announce yourself to strangers and familiars and that must have some kind of importance otherwise why is our sight and perception the way it is?",

My buddy just finished a $2000 back piece, and that is more than I spend on groceries in a year.\n\nI make good money too, but I grew up lower middle class and think I just associate tattoos with bad finiancial decisions.
