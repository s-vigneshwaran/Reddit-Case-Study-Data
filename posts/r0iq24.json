He had his 17yo son sell him a gun for weed because he was \"tired of this shit\" and that he saw a civil war coming and thought him going up and shooting a random alt righter was the beginning of a war. There's zero way you can defend this moron. I'm 100% sure the police assassinated him but let's not pretend Reinhoel is any different than Rittenhouse.",

The study you're talking about was found to be unreliable as it treated all religious beliefs to the same. I never said it didn't exist, I said it was found to be non-credible upon peer review.  \n\n\nJust because you can find it published on a .gov means nothing, it would take me 40 seconds to find a study on remote viewing on a .gov\n\nFor example of why this study was flawed, an average Buddhist's intelligence wasn't separated from an average Jehova's Witness' intelligence when they did the study.\n\nSo \"Oh look Religious people dumb!\" was the conclusion reached, artificially bringing down scores for Team Religious.\n\nThe study also did nothing to separate fringe beliefs from mainstream ones. So a Christian who knows Evolution and Climate Change are real, was treated as having the same beliefs as a Young Earth Creationist, by the study... instead of being classified separately.\n\nIf they had been classified separately, we would see Christians and Atheists being more even, while Young Earth Creationists scored waaaaay lower than either. (Keep in mind Young Earth is a minority view in Christianity, and is rejected by many institutions, including the Catholic Church)\n\nIt's very hard to gauge the beliefs of \"Religious\" people, when everything from a belief in the afterlife (still up for debate), a belief in the power of meditation (basically proven), and a belief that the Earth is 6000 years old (bullshit) are all treated as being under the same umbrella in your study.\n\n(Of course, this is neglecting the fact that IQ Tests are bullshit to begin...)\n\nMeaning the whole damn thing is nothing but a study in how Confirmation Bias can appeal to even those in Academia.\n\nAlso I find your claims about my level of education to be elitist, ableist, and mean-spirited.",
