          "text": "Well in part its because feminism has become so pervasive and preaches to people that money and power are the number one thing in life... and other metrics don't really matter.\n\nFewer women excel in those metrics because they just don't want them badly enough to sacrifice everything else in pursuit of them. It's the same reason why women tend to be the parent that opts to stay home with their kids when they're ill or are more likely to take on caregiving roles for elderly family members. Feminism says its because they're \"forced\" by patriarchy to do those things, but in reality most women willingly choose to do those things. \n\nI'm perfectly fine with the fact that I gave up a higher paid career so that I could be a mother. Even if I had stayed, I wouldn't have been able to focus or dedicate myself towards career progression... because my family must always come first and more money could never replace that for me. Unfortunately a lot of women feel cheated because they can't comprehend that it's an either/or option... you either pick extra time with your family or being career oriented... no one gets both, not even that top strata of super powerful and wealthy men.",

They are essentially marie antoniettes, when they don't get bread, they want cake. This is true, if we're being honest, of every woman. Feminists are just the very loud marie antoniettes. Heck, even equating us to dogs is a statement that is absolutely true to their hearts. The difference between the two camps, is that some have the sense to hide their opinions. That's why when you get angry, it concerns them all. One side (feminists) will want to kill you, and the other will want to smother you into silence.  \n\n\nStay angry, stay frosty. Peace.",
