I of course accept that, it\u2019s her body. \n\nThen in 2021 I dated a woman (31) with a child, she would also express during stimulation. \n\nNone of these cases were tied to any orgasms, but more to direct stimulation, during arousal. \nThey were never spraying on their own, a little drip maybe, but not a fit hose like anime. \n\nI am not a doctor or sexologist, so any experts stepping in here would rock. \n\nCertain medications can really mess with humans, with side effects. Such as Risperdal, which is the drug that gave Robert \u201cBob\u201d Paulson gynecomastisa (man boobs) in Fight Club. \n\nJohnson & Johnson has paid billions in settlements for this drug. https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/jj-settles-most-risperdal-lawsuits-with-800-million-expenses-2021-10-30/",

I'm so glad my mom convinced me to keep my eyebrow-grooming to simple shaping/unibrow prevention and explained how these trends go in and out of fashion. She did a number on her own eyebrows because the thin look was in when she was a teenager too, and between overplucking and hypothyroidism preventing them from growing back properly, she's had to draw them on every morning ever since!",

While a skin pore is open, sweat wets a strand of vellus hair. The sweat on the external part of the strand evaporates. More sweat wets the external part of the vellus strand and then evaporates. This process is called perspiration. \n\nFrom:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellus_hair",

A vestigial organ is one that used to be helpful, but isn't anymore, but also doesn't hurt us, so it isnt as pronounced as it used to be buy also hasn't gone away entirely. For example, whales have a vestigial pelvis. They used to live on land and walk with legs, so they had a pelvis like most land animals with bones do. But when they went to the water, the pelvis was no longer needed since legs became flippers, but the now tiny pelvis isn't really hurting much, so it's still there, just tiny and pointless. \n\nMany mammals have hairy faces, so it's possible that one ancestor to humans had hair all over its face for some good reason, but that's just gone away. Since, unless you're this guy from Twitter, the hair doesn't cause any harm, it won't go away entirely",

There's a reason why things like AI haven't progressed as much as visuals in games and you only need a look in the credit sections of games to know why. Visuals are more important for studios, one reason is that they're easier market, so they set aside more money (i.e. a larger staff, licensing of third party tools, ...) for having good visuals. AI is not that important, because you can't easily sell it in a short trailer or screenshot, and that's why studios don't spend lot of money on it, i.e. tiny credit section.",

Every dollar you spend on better graphics will be one dollar missing elsewhere, hence making games look better means they will be worse in other aspects. How is that so difficult to grasp?",

The higher the maximum, the higher the minimum. \n\nAnd like\u2026 are we really sure developers want to always be trying to do even more detail? Because that just sounds like saying they like all the extra work. Honestly like, the fuzz is hardly the problem with hyperdetailing. It\u2019s just an example of hyperdetailing. It applies to every single piece of the game. Something tells me nobody wants to be working for weeks on making rocks look hyperrealistic or detailing each individual thread in someone\u2019s clothes. All the elements have to be hyperdetailed for the people to not look out of place. Nobody wants to be the guy working on making the most realistic wood in gaming. The obsession with pushing graphics above all else has never been good for gaming. It means neglecting all the other elements. Games can be good without hyperreal graphics. You brought up the scaling, and I\u2019m reminded of Deus Ex because of it. Everyone looks equally hideous. It\u2019s still an amazing game.

I don't have in-depth knowledge but from what I've seen from showcase videos, you use systems to identify the face of your model automatically with high precision, then tweak it slightly to correct mark the face. Then you can add the hair to the model with a few other automatic systems.\n\nMy dad who is a professional photographer and image editor showed me how far even Adobe Photoshop's capabilities are in terms of doing stuff like automatically selecting all faces in a picture. I have no reason to believe game companies doesn't have even better dedicated systems that are able to do this kind of stuff easily.",

This detail is meant to add believability.  \n\nWhile 4D scanning technology can pick up the details of pores from a human subject, it has trouble scanning these very fine hairs, so they are added procedurally afterwards.\n\nMachine learning has gone a long way to simplifying character creation.  There are now several software packages which will generate a novel face from a mix of scanned facial features and give you a model with this much detail with very simple inputs.  For free! A talented artist still needs to make the asset look good, but they won't have to slave away for decades (anymore)\n\nThese details might be lost in a game like horizon zero dawn unless you stop playing and zoom way in. But lately Hollywood has been using game engines to render visual effects in realtime and details like these go along way in that application, and that is where the push for this quality comes from\n\nCheck out the ps5 matrix demo for some more mind blowing graphics",

Mistakes are made, people have varying written language skills, you can't rely on others to understand what you meant. Particularly when they're from another culture (I'm from Yorkshire).

I assume you get it, but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nMy language skills are pretty good. My vocabulary's pretty good. It's really not a stretch for you to believe me when I say I knew that people indulge in treats, commenting online isn't generally regarded as a treat, so I knew you meant the much more appropriate and commonly said \"*engage* in conversation\". That's a phrase you hear. You don't hear what you said because you got it wrong. Which circles back to my point: a) you can't rely on smart and dumb people to write we enough to get sarcasm across, b) sometimes it simply can't be gotten across when written, and c) you can't rely on smart and dumb people to parse sarcasm when it's given.\n\nIf I'm talking to someone who doesn't know which word they should've used out of 'indulge' and 'engage', and doubts I knew what each one already meant, I kinda rest my case.\n\nWhy did I correct you if I didn't know the meaning of each word?

Well, mostly clear. \n\nFunny story: When I was in college I was taking a course with only like 6 other students and the instructor. We all sat around a small conference table.  Don\u2019t remember how it came up, but I remarked something about my arm hair to this other girl in class and how I thought about eventually shaving it all off. Out of nowhere, this Asian dude from Korea who was SO QUIET ALL SEMESTER turns to me, quickly places his hand on my arm like he\u2019s trying to stop me from touching a hot burner and says, \n\n\u201cNo no. It is your fur.\u201d His English was a little broken and he had the coolest accent. \n\nI had some serious self-image issues back at school and that moment was seriously like the kindest, most accepting thing anyone has ever done for me. If you\u2019re still out there Korean dude from my interactive marketing class, thank you for your kind gesture. I have never forgotten it.",

It might simply be finer than you expect, so you think there is none (or it's been removed).\n\n I think the sometimes would be better used to describe a lack of hair - as written, it sounds like the default for women is no arm hair and some of us unfortunate hairy ladies have some, when it's actually very normal to have arm hair both on the tops AND undersides of arms (undersides have different hair type, see link below). I know this sounds like nitpicking, but it's a small, yet important deal. It's really important that basic bodily functions and appearances are normalized for women - without that, many women feel shameful or ugly for simply being a normal human being.\n\nThis link is a brief, interesting read about the evolutionary purpose and types of arm hair: https://www.livescience.com/56398-do-humans-have-hair-undersides-of-arms.html\n\n\nThis link is a good read about a celebrity normalizing arm hair: https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jameela-jamil-talking-about-womens-arm-hair-or-lack-of-heres-why-that-matters_uk_5c5c0033e4b09293b20bc215",

So yeah, I was bullied by my natural condition so I can speak from experience. Hairless women are as normal as hairy women and I wanted to include those because they are also shamed for not being able to grow hair, calling them ''childish''.

We could also argue all day about what qualifies as \u201cperfectly normal\u201d but that\u2019s a matter of opinion. I would argue that most peach fuzz (on men and women) is a bit shorter, but it\u2019s certainly possible and not uncommon for it to be this long or longer.

My subsequent replies were more about the amount of facial hair and your opinion that it's \"heavy handed\" in this case. I'm merely telling you that it's not, and that this rendering is a realistic representation of a woman's \"peach fuzz\", especially around the sides of the face and jawline where that fuzz tends to be a bit longer than on the cheeks. \n\nBecause this hair isn't very visible in day-to-day interactions, I understand why a lot of men aren't aware that this is not an unusual amount or length, which is why I was coming from that angle at first. It's just bizarre to see people saying that it's \"heavy handed\" or \"too long\" when what I see on her is what I see every day in the mirror, and I worry that younger girls and women will see these types of criticisms and start wondering what's wrong with them because they have the same amount or more. I know comments criticizing features on women that were perfectly normal or natural had a pretty big negative impact on me when I was a teenager, and if I were reading these peach fuzz criticisms back then, I'd probably be looking for my razor out of self-consciousness.",

This might\u2019ve been due to the limitations of the game engine or an effort to make the fuzz visible from further away, which is to say maybe we\u2019re looking at it here much closer than they intended for the players to.
