  "text": "TIFU by getting a co-worker to flash me\n \n\nObligatory 'this happened yesterday'.\n\nThe day before yesterday, my foster daughter had a bunch of her friends over to watch the premier of the new BTS video. I'd check on them every now and then and every time I saw them, they were doing these weird stretches with their arms over their heads or behind their backs. After a while, I asked, 'what are you guys doing?' They said it was a flexibility test they learned from friends at school.\n\nMove 1: [Clasp your hands behind your back](https://imgur.com/a/lSDPR7B) with one hand going over your shoulder and one going under.\n\nMove 2: [Prayer hands behind your back](https://imgur.com/a/VmJaqGY).\n\nMove 3: [Touch your elbows behind your back](https://imgur.com/gallery/v5kNu7f).\n\nMost of the kids could do 1 and 2, and they were laughing at each other's struggles to do 3.\n\nAfter a while, their video started and they moved on to more important things.\n\nThe next morning at work, I was curious to see if I could do the stretches. I stood in front of the full length mirror in my office and tried them. 1 was a little tough, especially in a button down shirt. 2 was easy and felt pretty good. 3 seemed to conflict with basic human anatomy. I tried different angles and wrist positions and didn't even come close.\n\nWhile I was doing this, a young female co-worker comes over and asks what I'm doing much like I did the previous night. I explain the stretches and figure she'll have more work since she's younger and in better shape than me.\n\nStretch 1, no problem. Stretch 2, it's like she was born to do this. Then she tries to touch her elbows behind her back and the buttons of her blouse completely give up. I'm staring at her in the mirror with her shirt split open with nothing underneath. She looked shocked and embarrassed. She covered up and walked out of the room.\n\nI run to the supply closet to grab a promotional t-shirt that we hand out at events and give it to her in her office. Then I go back to the room with the mirror to find her button, which I ended up sewing back on before anyone else made it to the office.\n\ntl;dr: I asked a young female co-worker to try a difficult stretch. Which led to her blouse splitting open while we were alone in the office.",

The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear a signal. A single lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start.",

                                  "text": "Unless you are ultra wealthy or exclusively make your own clothing, chances are the majority, if not all, of your clothes are [fast fashion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_fashion#:~:text=Fast%20fashion%20is%20a%20term,quickly%20while%20demand%20is%20highest.). I know mine are. They\u2019re items you find at like H&M, Old Navy, Walmart, Amazon (basically any major corporation that sells fashion) that are mass-produced and cheaply made. Basically, the items are made for short-term use and when they are discarded they just sit in landfills. The fashion industry wants us buying lots of stuff, then quickly disposing of it so we will then buy more items. More items = more profits. Plus, these items are often so cheap to make because they\u2019re made in sweatshops using exploited labour in unsafe conditions. Not to mention the environmental effects resulting during the manufacturing process. Profit trumps everything though, including the people and the planet\u2019s well-being. It\u2019s like Apple\u2019s planned obsolescence model. \n\nAlso, non-biodegradable material is often much more cost-effective than natural materials, but even if all clothing was exclusively made of biodegradable materials, because of the sheer quantity and time it takes to biodegrade (and again, the carbon footprint and labour exploitation behind the making, shipping, and selling of these products), it would still be problematic. Think of, like, how many T-shirts there are on this planet right now - ones you see in piles at every store; ones given away at events; ones given away with like cases of beer; all the band merch and sports shirts, I mean, they even make thousands that they know will be discarded when they predict a result before the game is played, like ones that read \u201cSuper Bowl Champions Buffalo Bills\u201d or \u201cUEFA 2022 Champions Liverpool\u201d\u2026 It\u2019s like how the environmentally-friendly solution of reusable tote bags has become a problem in itself, as like every single company puts their logos on a tote bag and gives them away - just looking around my room I can see a tote I got at my university\u2019s orientation, a tote from a vendor at my old job, a tote from my eye doctors\u2026I don\u2019t want to even think about all the totes shoved in the bottom of my closet. This NY Times article explains it: [\u201cAn organic cotton tote needs to be used 20,000 times to offset its overall impact of production, according to a 2018 study by the Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark. That equates to daily use for 54 years \u2014 for just one bag.\u201d](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/24/style/cotton-totes-climate-crisis.html). Better yet, [there\u2019s this funny and informative segment from an episode of Full Frontal that aired last month](https://youtu.be/dJg7bux5GW4), that explains the issue, shows why it is a problem comparable with the single-use plastic bags problem, and the overwhelming allure of the free tote!\n\nBTW, I hope you know I\u2019m not trying to condemn or shame you (I actually think you are awesome and of a rare-breed in that you didn\u2019t know something, so you asked) or anyone else for not knowing about the problem or for participating in it. Like I said, all my clothes are fast fashion, too. It\u2019s basically unavoidable for the average consumer. And fast fashion sitting in landfills is not an issue that affects most of us directly (at least not yet), and broader awareness of the issue could have detrimental effects for one of the biggest (and therefore most powerful) industries in the world, so it behoves the powers that be to keep awareness to a minimum. We need more restrictions on major corporations, as well as more awareness brought to the issue. But, since those major corporations hold vast amounts of wealth - wealth that can be used to fund and promote political campaigns and influence the individuals with the power to do something about it - they have the means to thwart any proposed measures that could restrict their profit-margins if they were forced to, you know, pay their workers a living wage, or make clothing designed to last, or use more sustainable materials and environmentally safer means of production, or to limit the amount that can be produced. That\u2019s capitalism for you. It\u2019s fucking us all over, and will continue doing so until it either destroys humanity and/or the planet, or until there\u2019s a revolution.\n\nTl;dr: The fashion industry profits from mass-production of cheaply made products that we, the consumers, will buy copious amounts of, dispose of quickly when they crap out or we get tired of them, only to replace with more cheaply-made mass-produced items, thus continuing the cycle and surrendering more of our money to the industry. Mass-production has a huge carbon footprint, plus the discarded fast fashion fills landfills. Capitalism is killing us and our planet. The love of money is they root of all evil.",

Then I did a research internship that required performing surgery on mice to implant these biotelemetry probes. And we had to use silk sutures to close them up, and while they were still anesthetized and under a heat lamp to keep them warm, we used the same bitter apple spray people use to keep household pets from biting onto or licking things, and we sprayed it all over where we stitched them up. Otherwise they would gnaw at them because they likely itched or were otherwise irritating. My lab partner forgot to do it on one mouse and the next morning he was dead. Lo and behold when we turned him over, he had chewed his stitches out and his intestines and entire abdominal contents were just bursting out of him.\n\nAnyways, now I know how to sew but the few times I have done it to prove to girls (and my mom and sister) that I could do it I got nitpicked on the type of knot I made, because apparently regular sewing knots are tied differently than I was taught to do surgical knots. But they work just fine!",

It was an oh shit moment, and what am I going to do as I had to take 2 different trains home during rush hour and I wasn't going to do that with my arse hanging out my pants.   I was lucky as it was the end of the day and not at lunchtime when there was a lot more people around who would've taken the absolute piss out of me, but still rather embarrassing all the same as I had to hurry over to the local supermarket (my arse got rather chilly!) where I managed to find a pair of trousers to switch into for the (1 hour, 2 trains) journey home.  If only I'd had a sewing kit on me, I could've run to the bathroom and quickly sewed them up just enough to get home without embarrassment.  That mistake I won't make again as, since then,  I've kept a small kit in my rucksack but never had to make use of it luckily enough.",

As soon as they did, she let out one of the loudest farts I had ever heard. It was long and comical and garnered the attention of the entire office before it was over. The event seemed to surprise Janice as much as it had everyone else.\n\nThen the laughter came. At first, it was just  Scott failing to suppress his laughter, but it quickly moved through the rest of the office until it became a deafening roar of cackling that rivaled the flatulence itself, but the laughter ended almost as quickly as it had begun, because the smell was formidable. \n\nGertrude, the old secretary lady wrinkled like a paper bag, was the first to vomit overwhelmed by the wretchedness that had emanated from Janice's hind orifice. Soon, the entire office was losing it's lunch like they had all had the fish from Airplane!\n\nIn a moment of pause, Gertrude quickly shot up to exit her desk, presumably heading for the water closet. However, she did not make it very far and slipped in her own gray chunky vomit landing on her side. The vomit splattered onto the white walls. Gertrude pressed the big red button on the LifeAlert necklace she wore religiously and spoke the catchphrase into it before collapsing face first into her former stomach contents.\n\nWithout hesitation, the all male staff raced towards Janice, overcome with passion and Janice eagerly allowed every man to have their way with her. She especially seemed to enjoy the overweight Sam and his hairy, pimpled stomach against her nylon black mini dress.\n\nAfter we had all had our way with Janice, we called it an early weekend and shut down our machines and headed out the door, stepping over Gertrude's body, which had remained unmoving for the entire 40 minutes of group lovemaking that fateful Friday afternoon.",

But if there\u2019s one win in this: I think a large majority no longer try to *blame* those women for getting attacked. Like you no longer hear \u201cshouldn\u2019t have dressed that way then\u201d very much anymore, or at least not as much as 10-20 years ago. Now I hope one day it will not make any difference anymore at all and we\u2019re moving towards that. But I fear it can currently still be a contributing factor, but women shouldn\u2019t feel the need to dress differently because of it.",

A couple of my cousins made fun of me for being 6'2\" and doing things like sewing and band, but it never bothered me. \nI learnt advanced sewing from my grandmother, but i got the reason for learning from my grandfather.  He picked up basic sewing while serving in the Army in WWII, because he had to keep fixing things while away from supplies.  He brought that mentality home to the family farm.  We lived in a house on that farm so every day as a kid it was school then chires, then free time.  He would fix seat covers, oil tarps, jeans and shirts, etc himself, so i saw it as normal.\n\nAt 16 I took my graduation exams and started community college, and being able to fix clothing problems on the spot saved me and several others lots of embarrassment.  I also continued volunteering with the marching band as support staff, and then joined a drum and bugle corps as support staff.  I could make and repair flags, uniforms, and props.  I did other stuff besides sewing of course, but not many people in my generation and younger could sew, sow it was an in demand service.\n\nMy sister never wanted to learn sewing at all, so she never got the history and family stories from grandparents that I did, so that was another big win for me.  Sunce my wife can't sew either, it means i'm the clothing fixer for our family.",

I\u2019ve also changed several tires for women (and one man) our age who didn\u2019t know how. \n\nI am by no means a tailor; but, before I left home, my mom made sure I at least had a basic understanding of how to mend and care for my clothes and do other household tasks. Dad taught me basic car care and I\u2019ve had to learn how to do a lot more over the years (yay for being broke lol). My daughter will be similarly equipped before she leaves home. \n\nHonestly, I think one semester of Home Ec and one semester of Shop should be required in high school. No one should graduate high school without at least a basic understanding of how to run a household and take care of their vehicle.",
