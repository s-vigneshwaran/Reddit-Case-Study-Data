You can also plug your monitor of choice into a laptop.\n\n>In 1440p or 4K too\n\nLaptop screens also come in 1440p or 4k, if you buy one with that screen resolution. Just like how you have to specifically buy a monitor with those resolutions to get that on a desktop PC. 1080p is also still the most common monitor size btw, by far.\n\n>Also worse ergonomics (neck problems).\n\nSubjective issue, and entirely dependent on how you use your laptop. I exclusively used a laptop before I built my gaming PC(it was all I had at the time), and the ergonomics were exactly the same, because I plugged two monitors and mouse & keyboard into it. My transition to a desktop PC was literally just unplugging all of that stuff from my laptop and replugging it into my desktop.\n\n>but to match a mouse you literally need the Apple touch pad.\n\nAgain, subjective opinion, admittedly one most people would agree with, but still subjective. I used to do a lot of pixel art, I *vastly* prefer doing that kind of work on a touch pad, *any* touch pad, than with a proper mouse.",

For business that's the logical take, but for an independent animator having a powerful desktop could be a better approach. Renting a server/farm is too expensive, and building one for just one animator usually doesn't worth it.",

Like, duh, obviously. But that's a meaningless comparison. If you need to transport seven people, a compact car ain't gonna cut it.\n\n> If you have all the external peripherals a laptop is just as productive.\n\nIf you have no need for a mobile computer and you need a keyboard, mouse and monitor to add to your laptop in order to make it usable, you may as well get a desktop.

For example, when I did shift work, there was a computer that our team used to log information. The entire team used it -- it was in no way \"personal\" -- yet it was a PC.  \n  \n\"PC,\" in that sense, is opposed to \"mainframe,\" in which case the computer is just a terminal used to access the mainframe, where the actual computation is done.  \n  \nSo, that aside, PC (personal computer) actually has *two* definitions. One is \"non-mainframe, self-contained computer,\" which covers a lot of computers running Windows, Linux, iOS, etc.  \n  \nThe other is [\"IBM-compatible computer\"](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001579.htm). Under this definition, a lot of computers running Windows and Linux are PCs, but some Macs *aren't* PCs. And since a lot of people not involved in tech never (knowingly) work with or deal with Linux, that means that for the most part computers are all either running iOS or Windows, and since some Macs aren't PCs, they conclude \"PC = has Windows installed.\"",

They insist you have to use the company laptop which means lugging a laptop back and forth on the train every day despite never actually using it as a laptop.\n\nI want a laptop with no screen, no battery, no keyboard, no touchpad, no USB/Ethernet ports, no wifi antenna. Just a CPU, RAM, SSD, Motherboard and a massive docking connector with a hundred pins to connect to a docking station with all the other stuff. If you take the motherboard out of a phone it has the CPU, RAM and SSD firmly attached and when you look at it without the battery, screen and network antennae it's actually tiny. You could do the same thing with a desktop PC with decent performance, consolidate the 'brains' of the PC down to a single removable module about the size of a VHS tape. Then you could carry it to use somewhere else without needing to carry the mouse and keyboard and all that weight because you've got all that at both ends anyway.",

If you're detaching the CPU from the electrical side you'll need to take the heatsink and fan with it, unless you want to apply thermal paste every time you plug it in the dock or want to put a ceiling on the performance it can manage.\n\nIf it's going to be taken seriously it needs to have at least the same performance as the highest-tier MacBook Pro. That's the benchmark for the highest performance from a 'normal' laptop (excluding the lunatics that wedge a server motherboard with Xeno/Epyc processors into a three-inch high briefcase and call it a laptop) and to compete with that it needs a grown-up processor with proper cooling. An ARM processor and some heat pipes aren't going to cut it. That means an aluminium heat sink with a fan and enough mechanical support than you don't accidently snap the CPU if you bash it slightly while putting the device in its dock.\n\nMaybe not as big as a VHS tape but definitely bigger than an audio cassette. To continue the analogies to older tech perhaps the size of an 8-track cart. \n\nThis picture of a NUC internals is getting close to the right idea [https://static.tweaktown.com/content/6/9/6991\\_14\\_intel-nuc5i5ryk-nuc-mini-pc-broadwell-review.jpg](https://static.tweaktown.com/content/6/9/6991_14_intel-nuc5i5ryk-nuc-mini-pc-broadwell-review.jpg) its got a laptop style cooling fan setup that might work. But there's still a lot of 'misc' on the board that could be offloaded. The design of the NUC is to be an all-in-one solution but if they tweaked it to be split into a docking station and a portable component they're not too far away. Split the motherboard in two, stuff that stays and stuff that goes with you. The usb ports, hdmi ports, etc, leave the circuitry for that in the dock not on the portable half of the motherboard.\n\nWhat I want to carry is the data storage, processor, RAM and the core motherboard components for the BIOS and the TPM or whatever chipset it is that's responsible for Hardware Encryption. So that this device that I carry counts as its own distinct computer and everything else is an empty shell, everything from the Network Interface Card to the Mouse is left behind. \n\nWhich reminds me, it will need some form of hardware biometric authentication like a fingerprint reader. The IT/cybersecurity team won't let you take it out of the office if the security components are part of a docking station that might have been tampered with.",

Tf\n\nEdit: Guys\u2026 If the specific outdated obscure software your company uses that hasn\u2019t adapted to modern technology and created a program, website, or software accessible by tablet/mobile has any sort of competition or anyone else in the world that does that function\u2026 then the function and purpose is most likely completable by said competition via smartphone/tablet.\n\nI\u2019m not trying to sound like an asshole and really it\u2019s okay to say \u201cif it works, it works. Why change it?\u201c regarding your program/software. Sometimes that\u2019s just more efficient than retraining everyone on how to use a new software and giving everyone tablets. My statement stands that the options exist for most modern functions in most modern industries. A smartphone (depending on the model) probably CAN burn your cd/dvd\u2019s with a disk drive attachment, otherwise there are better approaches to accomplish the goal that isn\u2019t so niche nowadays. Generally speaking, you are limited only by screen size, kb&m, and your own ability/familiarity with the technology.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to fish for these niche functions that are necessary for the most specialized individual only in your industry. It was a basic rhetorical question in which (I hope) you understood the statement made.",
