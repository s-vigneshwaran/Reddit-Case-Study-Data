Most people would say performing work to feed your family is a basic virtue men have to have in this world. \n\nI think some of these soy milk consumers have been alienated from peer groups of men who have good values, and they feel they could never fit in with them, based on negative experiences they've had. I'm guessing he also lives off of inherited money, because everyone I've ever met who thinks this way, and also, everyone I've ever met who writes this kind of article for mainstream publications, lives off inherited money. \"I've been freelancing.\" I'm like  \"yeah, right.\" So it may not be surprising if he's never labored alongside other men. You have to chip in, to win respect from a peer group of men, so if you don't learn how to chip in, you end up getting pushed to the outside of a group, and guys might give up after a number of failures.\n\nHopefully, he's open to changing his mind about these things. When you have kids, they are born with a lot of traits and instincts our caveman ancestors had. They can actually teach you as much as you can teach them. For example foraging food in a group and sharing it is an instinct that you don't have to teach them. But since you are a moderner, you are used to your food coming from a store. If you allow them to show you the enjoyment to be found in taking your food from nature, you will feel the instinct, again, yourself, and hopefully, you'll organize some fishing or gathering or farming for them.",
