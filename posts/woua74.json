The problem that is not getting enough recognition in the current mainstream feminist communities but actually arguebly should be as it should be considered part of feminism too is that the patriarchy also enforces roles these roles onto men and men who stray from them including not by choice such as being raped themselves are also socially punished.  Many feminist leaders have recognized this such as Bell Hooks in relation to their talks on intersectionality, but in communities themselves especially in more american communities that actually tend to be more connected to patriarchy then some feminist might want to admit, this often goes less recognized. The truth is that many feminists are just as much enforcing the exact patriarchy they think they are fighting aganist yet that doesnt mean aspects of true feminism arent interconnected with the rights of men too. It however does mean that feminism itself needs to recognize this aspect more too. I understand the purpose of this subreddit but I hope you consider what I just said too.",

The fact that she was one of the first big name feminist should scream that feminism is not for male equality. I could look up her name if you want but scroll through this sub and you'll find it. Either way. \n\nSo let's get something clear now because I've made this argument all too many times to have feminist make the same lame excuses. The fact that they still call themselves feminist means they are completely cool with what the old time feminist have said. Otherwise they use a different term like equalist or egalitarian. But the fact that they still call themselves feminist means they don't really care about the hatred towards men. They see what their fellow feminist say and do (including shutting down domestic abuse shelters for men) and choose to either ignore it or join it. That's why this sub is a thing to begin with. We're not looking to degrade women or make men 1st class citizens, we're here to point out the hypocrisy and hatred of feminist. Hoping that if we spread enough facts and knowledge that more and more people will leave that toxic group and join a more civil version that actually advocates for both genders. \n\nThats why im here at least. I shouldn't speak on behalf of all the members but im sure a good number of them are here for the same cause. Feminism is a parasite.",

Even if you agree to the concept that legally no consent is possible below the age of 18, 40 years of prison is heinous to ask for in such a case. I mean they were actually loyal to each other for 3 years! Just remember all the stupid stuff you were ok with and confident about during puberty. The actual harm done should guide the sentencing, not some abstract law written by adults who can't remember their youth! And this should actually be applied in every such case, even if the genders are reversed! Kudos to the judge to be able and brave enough to differentiate!\nI know it's an unpopular opinion, especially from an adult's point of view, but my motivation to look at this differently stems from my experience as a young teenager, when I was appalled by the fact that something fun and legal for adults, could be considered a capital crime when involving me, even if my explicit consent was given, which would legally be completely ignored.\nEventually the \"trauma\" caused by the breakup of such a sexual relationship is no different from the one if  a minor gets dumped by another minor. Noone to ask for 40 years of prison there.\n\nI know, that I choose not to shed light on the fact that she was acting from a position of power, which of course makes things worse for her, but for him - damn, probably quite a turn on!\n\nEdit: The guy hating her in the video seems a little frustrated (\"Hope they will kick this fuckheads teeth in\") WTF!? I mean, yeah, she is hot as fuck and someone like him would probably never get a shot at a woman of her league... but the little guy did. Must be so frustrating!",

We don't even know at what point (age) of the \"relationship\" they actually first had sex. You're just going for 10 year old because the guy in the video can't tell adding 3 years from subtracting them, but he was already 13 when it started. This changes the severity and that's exactly what the judge had to judge.",
