(I've argued before we _might_ want to give heads of household with non-voting dependents a multiplier) It's another thing to do so without clear cause, and as much as we try to justify that small states should have an advantage, no it just disenfranchises Californians and Texans and their ilk.\n\nSpeaking of California and Texas, the winner-take-all methods used by both states disenfranchise the sizeable _minorities_ in both. California is purple, leaning to indigo, and Texas is purple, leaning to magenta, but they both would be better represented by a proportional distribution as per Maine and ~~Alaska~~ Nebraska.\n\nAnd then there's the part where the political parties choose the electors which was supposed to assure that a roster of good ol' boys would be able to vote faithlessly for a more establishment presidential candidate, in case the proletariat (say, an overwhelming population of ex-slaves) were to choose someone that might serve them. These discussions were had during the original constitutional convention (although late in the meetings and while inebriated) and they chose the EC system as a means to check the power of the people, since a true democracy would be (according to them) rule by imbeciles or by the mob.\n\nSo no, the EC was a proposition against democracy from day one, and only quickened the dissolution of Federal elections into a charade. According to Professor Larry Lessig, it was Boss Tweed that took specific interest in controlling federal elections so that only plutocrat-approved candidates -- that is, _Tweed-approved_ candidates -- would ever make it to the primaries.\n\nAnd when we get public-serving officials such as Carter or Occasio-Cortez, yes, the parties further revise their rules to make the primaries even _less_ democratic, which is how the 2016 election was a total shitburger.",

These are key figures that without a single one of, the revolution would have failed. These men had their fellow citizens being killed by the British and the only way to stop it was permanently breakaway from England, and the only way to do that was with the South in tow. If the states north of the Mason-Dixon broke away separately, the British would have used the South as another staging ground like they did with Canada. Plus it wasn't like the British were going to abolish slavery as they profited the most from it, while being able to hold it at arms length. Even after the revolution, the fragility of the new country prevented anyone from using the federal government to do anything about slavery because the South voted as a single bloc when it came to anything remotely pertaining to slavery. There was just no way for slavery to be abolished at a national level for decades due to southern obstructionism. The very thought of the Federal government pushing the issue more strongly, nearly a hundred years later, triggered the Civil War that the country barely survived.",

The case was heavily used both by people trying to stir American independence & British loyalty. It stirred reactionary commentary from Benjamin Franklin, opinions from all factions of American colonial press (Patriot, Tory & Independent) & favor from prominent British commentary to favor British rule before Brits began emancipation to weaken the union [https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED245272.pdf](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED245272.pdf)\n\n  \n\\- \"No matter how much Patriots blamed the British for the slave trade, the existence of slavery in the colonies and its acceptance by most colonists considerably weakened the patriot call for liberty. In this context, the Somerset decision could only complicate the dilemma. If the patriot press gave the case major attention, Patriots would have placed themselves in the position of applauding the action of Great Britain and the frequently vilified Lord Mansfield..\"\n\n\"..the patriot press found its answer by covering the story selectively, its usual technique of choosing only those items that would work to separate the American colonies from Great Britain. Thus, the patriot press avoided the complete and generally accurate versions available in the trial versions in favor of the short pieces of opinion that emphasized the decision in its widest implications -- blacks  \nwere free in the Mother Country.\"",
