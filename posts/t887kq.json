So someone has to make those calls. \n\nThis is combined with a lot of people who just don't find it interesting or it's not directly related to their current lives in an obvious or helpful way and there will be a group of people who don't remember the basics of the curriculum (this is ignoring regular forgetfulness.) A curriculum that's been curated.    \n\n\nThere will also be political pressure to adjust the curriculum to present pretty awful stuff as \"necessary\" or they were good people for their time (lots of people didn't agree with slavery in the US when it was happening) because it fits their own political agenda.  \n\nI'm just saying there are all sorts of decisions made (and for different reasons) about what is and isn't added to an education curriculum.",

Like you mentioned, time is the biggest constraint. I grew up in and now teach in a state known for its good education, and even here it is so difficult to decide what to include and what to cut out. I have to condense a topic that I took a semester long college course in to a 1 hour and 15 minute class. \n\nNot to mention, so many people complain about what they did/did not learn, but they're coming from their own biases. The person above said that the US is presented as the first time people were free. Did they really learn that, or is that just what they remember? When I was in high school we took ancient/pre-modern history in 9th grade. In 11th grade we took US history. In the 11th history class we learn about the US as being monumental in the freedom afforded to (some) citizens. That's not wrong, because in the context of the modern world, it absolutely was. But the student might not remember being taught about ancient/pre modern socities 2 years earlier, where they learned about older democracies and republics. However, a US history teacher isn't going to bring that up because it's not within the context/scope of the 18th century. \n\nEven I'm biased. I went to a great school, but I quite likely recall more of my history lessons because it's always been an interest of mine and I continue to use the knowledge in my career. So I'm on here talking about how our history education wasn't really bad at all, while someone else can have gotten the same or similar one, but just due to individual differences we perceive them radically differently.",

Grow up man, get your head out of US propoganda and read a damn history book. One not written in America, you guys white wash your history so much I am surprised their is any ink at all.",

The thing is, the various city-states may have been... \"various\", but the culture, religion, language, art, mythology, etc. were all of one nation. I can still read and understand what's engraved on stones some thousands of years ago! In a nutshell: after Romans, then  Byzantium and Constantinople (Instanbul) falls and we get ~400years as subjects of the Ottoman Empire, final successful revolution 1821, official state as of 1831, we are \"awarded\" a foreigner King (Otto) of Greece, we quickly rebel to demand a Constitution (we get it, still have one thank God), the rest were Kings of \"the Greeks\", then we get a constant change of democracy, brief dictatoships and monarchs (aforementioned Kings), till 1974 when we said fuck y'all and we've been solely a democracy ever since.\n\nWeird that the birthplace of democracy has enjoyed so few years of it. But something instilled in a people, is just bound to surface. Inevitably.",

You confidently posted that 'some idiot started this \"republic, not democracy!\"nonsense...' right after incorrectly declaring the definitions of \"republic\" and \"democracy\".\n\nOh, really? Because here's the definition of a republic, easily found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic) or else literally through the [dictionary](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/republic).\n\n>A republic (from Latin res publica 'public affair') is a form of government in which \"supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives\". In republics, the country is considered a \"public matter\", not the private concern or property of the rulers. **The primary positions of power within a republic are attained** ***through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy*** **rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group**. With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.\n\nLiterally all a republic is is a state where the national interest is considered a *public matter* rather than a *private* one. Basically any nation which isn't a monarchy (or functionally one like North Korea) fits the definition of a republic. The important part is that being a republic and being a democracy *are not exclusive concepts*. Claiming otherwise would be like saying that humans aren't mammals because they're actually bipeds. They're descriptors for two different things, it's apples and oranges, being a republic in no way precludes a nation from *also* being a democracy.\n\nOh, and for the record, a [democracy](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/democracy) is:\n\n>government by the people; a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them **or by their elected agents under a free electoral system.**\n\nAgain, *not mutually exclusive with republic.*\n\n>That being said, the USA is a republic within the definition of the word given by several framers of the Constitution.\n\n...okay, and? Again, being a democracy and being a republic are in no way exclusive. They're describing different things.\n\n>There are numerous sources wherein the framers of the Constitution gave the definitions they used for those words and none of the ones I've seen mentioned anything you said; the only exception being the part about democracies directly making decisions. The \"through elected representatives\" is the part that differentiates a republic from a democracy within the definitions given by at least John Jay and Alexander Hamilton regarding the Constitution.\n\nIt doesn't matter the way the writers of the document define the terms, it matters what the terms *actually mean*. What you've just described is what is called a [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy), which is already its own thing *and in no way mutually exclusive with also being a republic*.\n\n>Also notice that a \"republican,\" not democratic, form of government is guaranteed to the several states under the Constitution. Most state governments vary only slightly from the functioning of the federal government. They don't vary, however, (as far as the state's constitutions I've studied) when it comes to representation vs direct management by the people; which, as I stated above, is the primary difference between republics and democracies.\n\nAgain, the definitions given in the Constitution to explain the system the founders wanted *do not matter*, the *actual definitions* do. Also, you are aware that \"democracy\" is a broad category that covers *multiple forms* of democracy, right? Including both direct democracy (Athens) and *representative* Democracy (the U.S., the modern U.K., Canada, etc). The founders were describing the United States as a \"republic\" in the Constitution *because they were setting up a new government in opposition to a monarchy,* which is *the opposite of a republic*. They weren't saying \"hey guys, we're a republic, not a democracy!\", they were saying \"we're a republic because *fuck the king*\". The reason for the emphasis on republicanism in the Constitution is specifically because they were in the process of rebelling from the British monarchy, and they wanted to emphasize that they weren't forming a new monarchy or other system of nobility.\n\n>Again, it is a republic, not a democracy.\n\nCategorically false. Adult non-felon citizens exercise their franchise to elect representatives, and those representatives make laws. That's a representative democracy, *which is a form of democracy*. Now you can say it's a shitty, obtuse, and corrupt form of democracy (which it is) because of the presence of money, the anti-democratic nature of the Senate and Electoral College which give extra weight to certain votes based on geography, and the establishment of the judiciary through appointment rather than voting, but it is still a democracy. That does not preclude it from *also* being a republic, *because it is both of those things and they are not mutually exclusive*.\n\n>One more difference, while not as obvious, is that republics in the USA are governed by laws (constitutions) that protect the rights of individuals. True democracies are subject to the dictates of the majority (which makes the majority the dictator.)\n\nThis is actual nonsense. Are you suggesting that democracies *do not have laws*? The actual fuck are you even talking about? Even Athens, the original direct democracy, [had its own code of laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_law). They even had, guess what, [\\*their own constitution\\*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Athenians_(Aristotle)) (well, several forms of one actually), though no copies of them remain and we just have Aristotles' writings about it. What, do you think every time someone stole some bread every single citizen would have to go vote on what happened to them? Citizens voted on laws, and those laws were enforced. Athens was a direct democracy because as a single city-state they were small enough to function as such (plus the fact that they heavily limited who was enfranchised and who wasn't), practically every democracy since then has been representative by necessity simply because you can't have every citizen voting on every single individual law when you're dealing with modern nations of millions of people, or absolutely nothing would get done. If you want an *actual* example of \"republic, not democracy!\" look to modern dictatorships or oligarchies like Russia, which do not have monarchies but also don't have free elections.\n\nLook, any political term like \"republic\" or \"democracy\" is by its nature going to be broad and imprecise, and no form of government is going to cleanly and easily fit the exact definition of any one system. The definition of \"democracy\" especially is insanely fucking broad and complicated, and is an umbrella term to describe [an absolute shitload of different systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_democracy). The United States government *is* a republic, and it is *also* a democracy, because it is governed through a form of *representative democracy.* Trying to claim that the United States is a \"republic, not a democracy!\" as if those are two mutually exclusive forms of government is asinine, and completely misunderstands the terms at use.",

The USA is a republic as declared by the founders and established in the founding document.\n\n>Now you can say it's a shitty, obtuse, and corrupt form of democracy (which it is) because of the presence of money, the anti-democratic nature of the Senate and Electoral College which give extra weight to certain votes based on geography, and the establishment of the judiciary through appointment rather than voting, but it is still a democracy. That does not preclude it from also being a republic, because it is both of those things and they are not mutually exclusive.\n\nBonus response: To what are you comparing the system of government here? You say it's shitty, but fail to explain why. You list reasons which are varying forms of \"it's not democratic,\" but failed to explain why they should be \"more democratic.\" Do you even understand the reason that those systems are setup the way they are?",

There is no mystery. It's clearly stated and also evident in the form of government that exists today.\n\nYou're literally falling for the exact same stupid shit that Rogan is *on the post we're both commenting on*. The writers of the U.S. constitution *did not* *invent* democracy, nor did they invent *the concept of a republic*. They are not the ultimate end-all-be-all authority on what those terms mean, especially nearly 250 years of political and civic development later. If you ask any political scientist alive today to give you a definition on what those terms mean, the ones I've already provided you are the ones they will give. And, as I've already explained in a significant chunk of my post that you conveniently ignored, the context in which the founders framed the United States as a republic was not in opposition to democracy, it was in opposition to a *monarchy*, the previous system of government they were rebelling from and wanted to emphasize their differences towards. When they *did* discuss democracy in the Federalist Papers, they were explicitly referring to *direct* democracy, which is again understood today to only be one single form of democracy. They needed to do these things because at the specific point in time the Constitution was written monarchies were far and away the most common system of governance, and while republics and democracies were not *new* concepts they *were* extremely uncommon and largely unfamiliar, and so it was necessary to emphasize the differences of the new government from the old.\n\nThe United States Constitution was a single document written 246 years ago. Since that time the United States has established a federal government, fifty separate state governments, and the governments of multiple unincorporated territories such as Puerto Rico, and has codified the laws and civic systems of those governments across quite literally thousands upon thousands of other documents and legal codes. The form those governments have taken has been, by and large, those of a democracy. The precise, specific language used when writing the Constitution nearly *two hundred and fifty years ago* largely *does not matter* in the face of the broader history of the terms being discussed.\n\n>That statement is just a repeat of your original claim. And, again, it's fitting for this subreddit because you seem so confident, yet so wrong. The USA is a republic as declared by the founders and established in the founding document.\n\n\"I didn't say it, I declared it!\"\n\nFun fact, it doesn't actually matter what you \"declare\" about yourself when discussing academic definitions. Crazy, right?\n\n>Bonus response: To what are you comparing the system of government here? You say it's shitty, but fail to explain why. You list reasons which are varying forms of \"it's not democratic,\" but failed to explain why they should be \"more democratic.\" Do you even understand the reason that those systems are setup the way they are?\n\nI actually did explain why, I just didn't go into detail because that's way the fuck outside of the scope of the current argument and requires far more work and debate to explain. But if you want to get into an entirely separate argument about why the Electoral College is a shitty system originally designed to benefit slave owners and that has had dangerous knock-on effects for the entire history of our country, we can do that too.",

I'll rephrase my question so that it's less confusing for you: How can something that takes place in the future impact something that has already taken place in the past? Using a definition from the future (which is another way of saying a different definition) makes no sense whatsoever and renders language useless.\n\n>Probably the fact that you're a random person on Reddit, and I suspect the global community of political scientists, academics, civil servants, and civics experts who have collectively spent the last few centuries studying these things probably don't give a shit about your opinion on definitional terms? Just spit-balling.\n\nLol The mental gymnastics and assumptions you're making are boggling my mind. Let me explain with a question: \n1. What does being a person on Reddit (a classification which you fall into as well) have to do with anything? If your position on that matter is valid, then your definitions are irrelevant as well. How do you not see that? \n2. How do you know that I'm not a \"political scientist, academic, civil servant or civil expert?\" As you said, I'm, to you, a random person on Reddit.\n3. How do you criticize me for Appealing to Authority by USING THE DEFINITION THAT A SPEAKER GAVE WHEN THEY MADE A STATEMENT when you literally just tried to invalidate my position because [authorities] don't care about about my \"opinion\" (Which is not an opinion it's a fact.). Pleeeeese explain how your actual appeal to authority is more valid than my alleged appeal which, by the way, is the way the Supreme Court interprets Constitutional issues. (That's much more of an appeal to authority than using someones definition that they gave to understand their intent.)\n\n> wherein you claim that because the founders didn't explicitly say the word \"democracy\" in the Constitution, that means we aren't one...\nAgain, using a defintion from the future to recreate meaning in something that was said in the past doesn't make sense to me. Please explain how changing the meaning behind words is valid.\n\n> ...the current text of the United States Code, the official compilation and codification of the general and permanent federal statutes of the United States (so, y'know, basically our entire federal system of government), contains the word \"democracy\" 324 times, and the specific term \"our democracy\" 11 times.\n\nYet again, an appeal to authority that falls on it's face. Congress does not decree what form of government exists in the United States (Outside of whether or not a state government is republican). That power is outside of their delegated authority as well as their ability. If authority is enough for you, then federal constitution, being the supreme law of the land, and overriding any congressional claims/declarations that contradict it, will affirm that the governments are republican. Even the acts that add new states to the Union include language such as \"... has found to be republican in nature.\" And even if your claim were not invalid for that reason, it would still fail because the framers gave the definitions that they used. As I requested above, please explain how language can have any meaning if it's valid to later change expressly declared definitions.\n\n>Well, now you've gone and completely misrepresented what a dictatorship is, but that's par for the course really, and I'm just not going to bother getting into it to be honest. Read the actual definition, you might learn something.\n\nI'm confused. What am I supposed to be learning? The site you linked to has a definition that says: \"a government organization or group in which absolute power is so concentrated.\" The majority is a group \"in which absolute power is concentrated.\" What am I missing here? \n\n> The writers of the U.S. constitution did not invent democracy, nor did they invent the concept of a republic.\n\nI never said that they did.\n\n>They are not the ultimate end-all-be-all authority on what those terms mean, especially nearly 250 years of political and civic development later.\n\nI never said that they were.\n\n>If you ask any political scientist alive today to give you a definition on what those terms mean, the ones I've already provided you are the ones they will give.\n\nAgain, I'm not sure how a definition that was created after-the-fact can override one that was expressly given at the time the word was used. \n\n> And, as I've already explained in a significant chunk of my post that you conveniently ignored, the context in which the founders framed the United States as a republic was not in opposition to democracy...\n\nThat is totally incorrect and directly contradicts the writings of the framers regarding the constitution, the constitution itself and supreme court rulings on the nature of government here.\n\n> The precise, specific language used when writing the Constitution nearly two hundred and fifty years ago largely does not matter in the face of the broader history of the terms being discussed.\n\nNooow we're getting to root error in your entire position. \"The precise, specific language used when writing the Constitution\" does matter because your statement about \"a republic, not a democracy... being repeated ad nauseam by people who don't actually understand what words mean\" constrained your comment the U.S., which is what I've been talking about the entire time. You keep bringing in other, irrelevant definitions and trying to apply them outside of the context wherein they were created. Those definitions have no bearing on the definitions that control when dealing with the government of the USA. The definitions that control within the context of your statement \"it's a republic, not a democracy\" render your statement incorrect, and the confidence with which you made you confdently incorrect, which makes your statement a valid candidate for being posted in the subreddit r/confidentlyincorrect.",

He\u2019s a normal guy who has moments where he is clearly wrong and has a big gap in his self awareness, but he also has this uncanny ability to open his guests up and get them to talk about incredibly interesting things and to share their life experiences. Joe does a great job probing their minds when he isn\u2019t being a dummy and pushing some stupid idea he hasn\u2019t fully thought through. \n\nBut you have to remember all of these clips you see are 15-20 seconds of 3-4 hour long conversations. There\u2019s bound to be stupid things he says here and there when he puts out hours and hours of material every single week. The real trick trick to know when listening to his show is that the real content comes from the things his guests say not what Joe Rogan says. He\u2019s just a great vector for getting others to speak in a long form format and there\u2019s value in listening to things critically so you can learn to discern BS from truth. \n\nAlso most people don\u2019t ONLY listen to Joe Rogan. I have plenty of well though out podcasts like NPR, NYT,  Slate Amicus, and BBC podcasts to listen to when I\u2019m tired of Joe Rogan being exceptionally inaccurate in a podcast.",

He invites guests on both sides of the argument to plead their case and leaves it to the viewers to make up their own mind. This can definitely be damaging to those who blindly consume anti-vax ideas without critical thought, but for a discerning listener it is a fun exercise to hear all the arguments. \n\nHonestly listening to Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast has STRENGTHENED my view that vaccines are effective not weakened it. His podcast is in no way exclusively anti-vax climate change denial hoohah. There are a lot of truly valuable discussions that go on. But there will always be people out there in the public sphere who are wrong or who have bad takes trying to argue their viewpoint on important issues and sometimes Joe brings them on and sometimes he does agree with them.

I know you touched on this but I don't think you've actually thought through *how* damaging it is. \n\nYou're not the person we worry about when we worry about people spreading misinformation. Not everyone is going to go into thinking \"this will be a fun exercise in critical thinking!\". Tons of people will hear them agreeing with what they want to hear, and leave it at that. Or, if they do watch the other side, they think *exactly what you just thought*: \"I just don\u2019t mind hearing them out and coming to the conclusion that they\u2019re wrong and have a dumb take.\" in the opposite direction.\n\nThis is why it's better if misinformation doesn't exist or at least isn't spread. It gives credibility to false views, whether you believe it or not. Just because you are able to think critically and not fall for this stuff, doesn't mean everyone is.\n\n>He invites guests on both sides of the argument to plead their case and leaves it to the viewers to make up their own mind.\n\nIs this really the right way to go about things, versus only giving correct information? If he had people coming on saying rejecting chemo and eating a single slice of bread with almond butter on it every day will cure cancer, what benefit is that bringing the world? Even if he has opposing views also the next week, so people can \"make up their own mind\", what good is that when one side is literally insane and actually costing real people their lives if even one person \"makes up their own mind\" that bread guy was right?\n\nSorry but these stop being fun thought experiments and \"interesting to see what the other side says\" once they start causing real damage to real people. At that point it's no longer moral to create the content at all.\n\nI hope you'll at least *consider* \"my side\" when making up your mind on this topic.",

I think MOST people who listen to Joe Rogan are level headed and analytical of his statements in the exact same way I am. Just look at all of the responses in this thread defending him. People who watch him are intelligent, are critical, and aren\u2019t the alt-right lemmings the media makes them out to be. Joe Rogan and his fans are a scape goat to distract from the real forces damaging our society. The ones calling him a racist and a conspiracy theorist are fighting an ideological battle for your mind and they are using the claim that Joes fans are anti-vax and racist conspiracy theorists to try and scare you away from engaging with the ideas that joe and his guests present. \n\n2. You ask if it\u2019s not better to just have a source that only gives out real \u201ctruth\u201d and never falsehood unlike Joe Rogan. I say this with nothing but care in my heart but your idea that there is an official source of Truth that is never wrong is absolute 100% dangerous BS, and it has caused you to seriously misunderstand what kind of content Joe Rogan is putting out. \n\nEVERYONE is wrong at some point or another. But what gives me faith in Joe Rogan\u2019s authenticity is his clear willingness to listen to his critics and modify his behavior. When the media criticized him most recently of only bringing on fringe voices on important topics like covid and climate change, he responded by saying that while he feels that claims of him an alt-right conspiracy theorist are simply bad faith smears, he does understand the need to have more mainstream opinions on his show to counteract the less mainstream views showcased on his show. And then his VERY NEXT guest was a scientist who held a more mainstream opinion on climate change and openly criticized Joe\u2019s previous guest who was skeptical of the impact humans have on climate change.",

What I meant was the creators should strive to only give out factual information, and not intentionally give out false information that can harm people due to other motives. Absolutely everyone can be unintentionally wrong sometimes. Ideally they would correct themselves as soon as they are aware. I personally believe he intentionally gives, at best, not well verified information that can potentially harm people. \n\nAs to your first point, it's entirely irrelevant to me whether most are like you, or any percent that is less than 100. If 15% of his viewers are being harmed by the false information he is giving, that's personally unacceptable to me. Same with 10%, 5% and 1%. I don't believe using the defence that most people are fine is a good defence.",

In order to arrive at the best conclusion all ideas and views should be presented and pitted against each other (like we are doing right now) and people themselves must decide what to believe(like someone reading these comments decides to side with either you or me). If you dont allow this you will soon find yourself in some dystopian society. Joe rogan seems to have an impressive ability tolerate opposing views even though he whole heartedly disagrees with them. This is something me myself am not that good at. So I believe people like him are very important and his discussions and podcasts are very valuable to society.

Just as anything that becomes too popular jumps the shark, so too will Rogan, or has already depending on who you ask.",

No matter your opinion of them. Sometimes its interesting to hear them talk because all you usually are getting from the media are sound bites. Much like this clip. \n\nI get it though. If all I were seeing from Joe Rogan were 15 second clips like this id buy into the the fact that the podcast was worthless too. \n\nBut when you are sitting there and its you and these people talking. You take it subjectively. You listen to two people have a conversation and sometimes you can sit there and be like \u201cnah they are wrong here.\u201d Sometimes Jamie will even say it. Sometimes someone else will. But at least its coming from a place of listening. Unlike most news sources that bombard you with information that can usually be just as wrong as anything else but throw it at you like complete facts. And you would think the news has to be truthful but we all know its not. \n\nAnd at least with Joe Rogan, there doesn\u2019t seem to be ill intent on his part. Just ignorance that he\u2019s usually willing to own up to. But with the mainstream media. Their \u201cmistruths\u201d are usually done on purpose. \n\nAnd you have to ask yourself. Why Joe gets all this hate? Well think about it. One guy has all of these listeners. Way more than any news channel does. Way more reach. And hes not beholden to anyone. Thats powerful. And the mainstream media doesnt like. And they\u2019d rather discredit him and have you get your information from them rather from a guy like Joe. \n\nI suggest finding someone on Joe Rogan that you are interested in and listen to it. See for yourself. Instead of going off of the social media propaganda.",

Everyone I see make way more errors or have agendas to drive. I don\u2019t think Rogan has an agenda. He\u2019s genuinely interested in many topics and likes discussing them.

Coupled with the fact that these podcasts are very long, so the interest in a particular subject will need to be high enough to engage a person for that amount of time. \n\nTaking your sarcasm aside, there are only two parties in your country with very little room to negotiate anything reasonably, if there is discussion around these subjects it would not be surprising to find that there is an idea that someone is 'against you'. This is not a good way to operate, in my opinion, as you have some heavily pre-conceived ideas about the persons character.\n\nI'm from Africa so I try to avoid the political mess that pretty much everyone gets dragged into, but I will say it's weird you compare an agent provocateur with a guy that as far as I know, is for universal healthcare, education, eradication of drug policy and pretty much every single left leaning policy that's on the cards.

There where a lot of interesting thoughts floating around at the time. My main point is that the Declaration of Independence was not created in a vacuum.

It established a democracy among the once-warring tribes of the Seneca, Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, and Mohawk, which became known as the Iroquois Confederacy.\"\"The Iroquois Confederacy, founded by the Great Peacemaker in 1142, **is the oldest living participatory democracy on earth**. In 1988, the U.S. Senate paid tribute with a resolution that said, \"The confederation of the original 13 colonies into one republic was in\ufb02uenced by the political system developed by the Iroquois Confederacy, as were many of the democratic principles which were incorporated into the constitution itself.\"\"\\[Onondaga leader Canassatego\\] used a metaphor that many arrows cannot be broken as easily as one. *This inspired the bundle of 13 arrows held by an eagle in the Great Seal of the United States.*\"\"Franklin referenced the Iroquois  \\[Haudenosaunee\\] model as he presented his Plan of Union at the Albany Congress in 1754, attended by representatives of the Haudenosaunee and the seven colonies. He invited the Great Council members of the Haudenosaunee to address the Continental Congress in 1776.\"\n\nEdited to add in \"Haudenosaunee.\"  I left in the original copy-pasted term I used too just so it's easier for people to do searches on the democracy's formation and I don't know if that's just the law's name or if I should change it too yet but, if you check out the replies, you'll learn like I did that Iroquois isn't a word the nation used for themselves and that Haudenosaunee is their name. I'm off to learn more about this now too so I know how to say it all in the future!",

I\u2019m also very cynical about how a constitutional rewrite would turn out today. There are probably enough states in favor to get abortion ban in the constitution, DOMA in the constitution, etc. Hell, I would only be a little surprised if the 14 and 15 amendments didn\u2019t make it in.",

Men should maintain agency of their own bodies for the full time their bodies are involved in making a baby, which is just during sex. They should be free to use protection and to stop having sex at any point. But if they get someone else pregnant then they are partially responsible for caring for the child should they be born since they chose to perform the act to create that child. They do not get to tell the mother what to do with her own body. \n\nThe only way your view could be consistent is if you also believe that fathers should have no rights over their children, even if they want to be fathers, since you view it as being the woman\u2019s choice to have a child.

You can look at the technicalities of the arrangement but it's nit picking, frankly.\n\nThe US president has more rights than the average US citizen. Does that make the US no longer a democracy?\n\nI imagine every single nation in the world has a leader who has more rights, powers and freedoms afforded to them than the citizens they lead, I certainly can't think of any that don't.",

Its good that people have more freedom than rest of the world because of the prosperity they accumulated with colonialism and stealing so the monarch can afford to give away some power to people and still live in comfort and enjoy their \"birthright\" nobility. If wouldn't be any different from any other shithole monarchies if England didn't steal enough from others including its immediate neighbors.\n\nbut its just not democracy bro. Sorry about that.",

It was in 1832 that we became a \"democracy\" (only wealthy landowners could vote, which I believe is how your first iteration of democracy worked too), whilst I would assume that the US became one shortly after gaining independence in the late 1700s\n\nNeither early British or American democracy deserves to be called democracy, even by representative democracy standards. It was too restrictive in who was allowed to vote. In the UK universal suffrage was only achieved in 1918, while in the US it was only functionally achieved in 1965. \n\nI hope you're not trying to imply that America wasn't itself an imperialist state? Manifest destiny ring a bell? Past that, the Philippines? Hawaii? American Samoa? Panama Canal Zone? Puerto Rico? The \"soft colonialism\" of Latin America, with its CIA-imposed regimes? Britain certainly colonised the most land, but that feels like a rather pointless detail.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean by 'surpassed', but in terms of total land control France wasn't too far off (same for Spain if you're talking that far back, but I don't think you are), and in terms of atrocities, I think the Belgian Congo was probably handled the most inhumanely. That said, genocide in the dominions (especially Australia, carried out by the settlers there) was on par with, and even surpassing that of what occurred in America, so all in all I would agree that the British Empire was worse than the American Empire, with perhaps it's only saving grace being that a lower percentage of the conquered lands were assilimated/absorbed into a British state, but in terms of total land, Canada and Australia together easily surpass the US. \n\nBut I'm not sure why you brought this up. If your point is that, through imperialism Britain was imposing dictatorial rule on vast swathes of the globe, I certainly see your point. The best counters I can make are that:\n\n1) The colonies wouldn't exactly have been democratic had they not been colonised, they were mostly Kingdoms (but this is a weak arguement, fact is that Britain was in control and it was its responsibility at that point), and \n\n2) America has played a massive roll in subverting democracy, through regime change",

It was still wild how George Washington basically could have taken the country any number of different directions, from crowning himself king of America (there actually was support for that notion) or ruling as a tyrant.\n\nJohn Adams was more or less very much aligned with Washington still, and exactly the sort of person who would have been directly picked by Washington if he were so inclined.  But Jefferson was very, very far from it and was viewed as anathema by Washington and Adam\u2019s camp.  \n\nThe fact that there was a peaceful transfer of power between Adams and Jefferson, without Adams trying to sabotage Jefferson and Jefferson trying to exert the full power of the executive branch over the forming rivalry he had in Adams is truly a thing to be marveled over and is one of the most unique things to have happened just about anywhere in the world.  And it continued a tradition that ran very strong for 220 years until the orange dumbfuck went and pulled his bullshit.  \n\nThe US is a flawed country 100%, with an absolute fuckton of flaws baked in at the outset, but there was the tiniest nugget of truth that Rogan had, until he built a ridiculous straw man around it like the knob that he is\u2026",

A more comparable example in term of origin would be the French Revolution, despite it going horribly wrong. Anyways, it's not a surprise that a lot of the theories that inspired the founding fathers come from the cultural Renaissance and what was built upon that, commonly known as the Enlightenment. \n\nThat's really the important part that Rogan is missing, I assume because he doesn't have the educational background: It all built upon each other. The United States was less of an new experiment, in that regard, but a forward-thinking group of people who had a deep understanding of what we call social studies today, which enabled them to draw from a lot of historic and scientific work, to craft something on \"a blank paper\", which turned out to be remarkably stable. As you said, that is what makes it exceptional (At least in my limited, euro-centric understanding), but it was by no means original.

The way it was arranged was very much revolutionary and shows a lot of understanding for what went wrong, prior. And, what is probably most exceptional, was the understanding that for Democracy to work, someone has to loose and accept being the looser, something that never really worked out in Europe, before. As I said, less a argument between factions, but Revolution from above. Your point about checks and balances is also very much valid.\n\nI listed the French Revolution as example for it being birthed from a bloody Revolution, just like the US, not to say that it was earlier or the inspiration. It's just the most similar thing that happened in Europe around the same time and did absolutely draw, not only from the American revolution, but from a lot of the same school of thought.\n\n>Again, all the \u2018Mercans going on about freedom, spreading freedom, blah, blah, do have a tiny kernel of truth in what they\u2019re saying.

The 'Barbarians' you speak of became the backbone of the empire fairly quickly and many of them rose to the position of emperor over time. For comparison sake, it's also kinda hard to compare if you don't specify what part of the Roman Empire's history you are talking about for comparative purposes.The Romans certainly revolutionized warfare, siege weapons, and their capabilities in draining marshes/building aqueducts, and overall construction are very impressive. But there are many impressive cultures from those time periods and to exalt Roman culture to such an extent is very narrow-minded.",

Although to compare them outright to one another isn't right considered how little they interacted due to distance. They each were top dogs in their respective parts of the world. In many ways China was also peak human culture, but, I prefer the aspects of human culture that the Roman Republic endorsed over China. Look at the construction of the Great Wall for one of countless examples. The Romans were brutal yes, but they would never have did that to Roman *citizens* because they were Roman. \n\nRomans adapted things from many cultures, and improved upon them which is why they became one of the most influential civilizations in human history. Sure the Greeks pioneered the military tactics used by the Romans, along with much of the architecture, but the Romans took it to a whole new level. \n\nYou're correct that the barbarians in time became the backbone of the Empire, but, by that point the Romans generally speaking had lost sight of what it meant to be Roman. They grew decadent and their fall became inevitable.\n\nAlso, I at no point said I believed the Empire to be their peak. Please review my comments.",

And they did all of this while still having a democratic city full of farmers, merchants and philosophers.\n\n\nAnd where do you get the idea that \"Nomads make war, farmers make culture.\" What about all the wars that Ancient Egypt fought with the Hittites? Or all the wars that went on in the fertile crescent between the agricultural societies there? What about the agricultural society of Rome who fought Carthage, Greece, Egypt, Parthia, the Seleucids, Pontus, etc, all of whom were agrarian?",

To be a Roman legionaire was a position of esteem; only citizens of Rome for the longest time could join the military. Romans genuinely believed in what it meant to be Roman, it wasn't a fashion statement for them but it was part of their very sense of self and they did it all voluntarily and with the utmost pride.",

Heck you see a divergence between the armed forces and Rome entirely.\n\nI think we should be careful about drawing too strong a set of conclusions from the Roman use of dictators. They did provide a useful tool to take decisive, radical action quickly and cut through red tape, but that in part was necessary because the constitutional structure of the Republic was much more Conservative than any modern democratic state. \n\nConsuls were there more to respond to the problems of the day than find ways to significantly improve or alter the roman state as we'd expect a modern government to do. From a divided twin executive to extensive veto powers to the need for religious sign-off, the roman state was constitutionally encumbered in peace-time decision-making in a way that saw a need for positions like dictators that aren't necessarily reflected in modern democracies, or can be filled by less radical legislative instruments like emergency powers acts. \n\nObviously all this comes with some exceptions like the Gracchi, but they are noteworthy specifically because of their desire to introduce proactive change.\n\nHave a lovely day",

Obviously, if you control the majority of the senate, it sounds kinda silly. But yes, it's one thing to lead a small group against another and kill your way to leader. It's another to take a huge empire like Rome and be able to put it under your thumb via words.",

Plus the issues with gerrymandering, voter suppression, and the like. Realistically the US of A kinda dragged it's feet on the whole \"freedom for all\" thing for a while.\n\nPlus, if we consider democracy a constantly evolving system rather than a specific one from 1776, which I agree with, then he's definitely wrong about the \"first to have elected officials and self governance\" thing. Going back to Republican Rome, they definitely had those, just from a restricted pool of voters and candidates. Expanding that pool was part of the evolution of the Republic and later representative democratic systems.\n\nAnd *that's* without even getting into his \"every previous country was ruled by dictators\" thing, if we really wanna argue semantics haha. A dictator is a ruler who wields absolute power over a country. There have been *many* prior countries where the ruler shared power in some form and was not a dictator, see the Magna Carta. Some may have had dictators at some point but that's a very broad statement\n\nBasically we've all put way more thought into this comment than he ever did",

Between Parliamentary sovereignty, the position of the Prime Minister and the powers vested to him by the crown and the government, ever UK prime minister effectively has absolute power in a conceptual sense. The moment they are unable to demonstrate absolute power their leadership is called into question.\n\nA Prime Minister is appointed based on their capacity to command a majority in Parliament. That (and generally being an MP themself, although being a member of the House of Lords has also previously been acceptable) is the only major requirement to be appointed Prime Minister today. Parliamentary sovereignty gives parliament absolute power over all laws in the United Kingdom. Parliament has the power to pass any law on any topic they want and have it become law here. Given that to be Prime Minister you are required to have the ability to command a majority in that House to make such rules, the position requires the office holder to be able to wield the power of a dictator, and anyone who displays an inability to do so is no longer considered fit for office and generally must resign or hold an election.\n\nOf course so much of this is ran by gentlemanly agreement and longstanding convention that it's more than a little insane.",

It's widely accepted among historians, that the fundamental erosion of democratic principles really had an impact from 300AD and onwards.\n\nIf you are arguing that Rome itself was a patriarchy and that Greater Rome wasn't democratic, almost feudalistic, I am with you, but if you look at Rome specifically, that's a really hard sell, especially calling it a Oligarchy, comparable to something like Mainland China.\n\nI'm wondering, is your issue here with human rights? Bc the notion of that being part of Democracy is a modern understanding of Democracy. That's generally considered a separate discussion, in a historic, analytic sense.",

The 1907 year you're probably encountering is when we became an official Dominion on the British empire. Before that we were a colony which obviously worked under democratic rules, but even then it doesn't help the claim they were making abut before 1776. 1776 is only a few years after Europe discovered NZ. The only people there were Maori, and I'm not sure you could call what they had a proper democracy (I'm pretty vague on how leaders were selected though tbh).",

It contained one small hard-baked bean, and whoever got the bean was, possibly after some dental attention, hailed as King.\nIt was quite an inexpensive system and it worked well, probably because the clever little bald men who actually ran things and paid some attention to possible candidates were experts at palming a bean into the right bowl. And while the crops ripened and the tribe thrived and the land was fertile the King thrived too. But when, in the fullness of time, crops failed and the ice came back and animals were inexplicably barren, the clever little bald men sharpened their long knives, which were mostly used for cutting mistletoe. And on the due night, one of them went into his cave and carefully baked one small bean. Of course, that was before people were civilized. These days, no one had to eat beans.\"\n\n-  *Night Watch*, Terry Pratchett",

Whilst during the french revolution, revolutionaries like Lafayette would delight in following the Americans, before 1792 the french constitution was much more a constitutional monarchy akin to England/ great Britain's monarchy (again highlighting the importance of the glorious revolution), and after 1792 the liberals that admired america were out and the radicals were in, and they forged their own revolution with very little reference to the American revolution. Revolutions in the 19th and 20th century would look to the french revolution, not the American. It could very well be argued that in this chain of events toppling monarchies, America's biggest contribution was adding to the crippling debt of the ancien regine in France. \n\nThe American revolution was a significant event. You are however overstating it's importance, especially regarding European revolutions and the overthrow of monarchies. The french revolution serves much more the event revolutionaries looked to, and the starting point in a chronology of revolution is better asigned to the English civil wars or even dutch independence.",

The French Revolution lasted 10 years (depending on who you ask, but 1789 to 1799 is fairly accepted), the most important period of the revolution was 1792-1795, and during those years America had no effect on the French Revolution.

This escalated to such an extent that the final king of Poland, Stanis\u0142aw Poniatowski, was elected with the very intention of being a Russian puppet (he was, after all, Catherine the Great's ex boyfriend).",

Let him be put to death with impunity, and let his property be confiscated to the public, with the reservation of a tithe to Athena. Let the man who has killed him, and the accomplice privy to the act, be accounted holy and of good religious odor. Let all Athenians swear an oath under the sacrifice of full-grown victims in their respective tribes and demes, to kill him. Let the oath be as follows: \u201cI will kill with my own hand, if I am able, any man who shall subvert the democracy at Athens, or who shall hold any office in the future after the democracy has been subverted, or shall rise in arms for the purpose of making himself a despot, or shall help the despot to establish himself. And if anyone else shall kill him, I will account the slayer to be holy as respects both gods and demons, as having slain an enemy of the Athenians. And I engage, by word, by deed, and by vote, to sell his property and make over one-half of the proceeds to the slayer, without withholding anything. If any man shall perish in slaying, or in trying to slay the despot, I will be kind both to him and to his children, as to Harmodius and Aristogeiton and their descendants. And I hereby dissolve and release all oaths which have been sworn hostile to the Athenian people, either at Athens, or at the camp (at Samos) or elsewhere.\u201d Let all Athenians swear this as the regular oath immediately before the festival of the Dionysia, with sacrifice and full-grown victims; invoking upon him who keeps it good things in abundance, but upon him who breaks it destruction for himself as well as for his family.",

It didn't outlaw slavery, and as I told you elsewhere, the United States was FAR from the first country to free its slaves.\n\nWe had to fight for a century, and with through the blood and toil of 100s of thousands of soldiers and freedom fighters alike to AMEND the Constitution to get it to actually free those people. \n\nIt's at best disingenuous to claim that the document itself was anything more than an unfulfilled promise of freedom for a country that only let 5% of the country vote at its inception and had between 30-40% of its humans in literal bondage.",

That's all you have to disavow that other countries outlawed slavery before us?  \nWhat the fuck else is \"self-abolish\" if it isn't when the king declares \"No more slavery\"?

They fought a goddamned war of independence to declare that they are no longer slaves and will never have any more in their country.  If that's not \"self abolish\" then the person who made up that term to suit their argument is just a fucking idiot.  \nDid Chile not \"self abolish\" in 1823?  They used an entire representative movement to ensure it would be forever emblazoned into their Constitution.  How the fuck is that not good enough for you, either?  \nNo one fucking else did it for them, what in the fuck else is \"self abolish\" supposed to mean?\n\nSorry but you're a fucking dumbass.

It wasn't until racial purity laws were passed in the mid 1800's that non-whites weren't allowed to vote. As long as you looked \"white enough\" you could vote. I can't find the source, but I'm pretty sure Jefferson's half-black bastard children were landowning voters.",

It started when he was playing COD online a lot (at his dad's house) with a group of adult men who turned out to be trump supporters/raging conspiracy theorists when he was about 16. They got him listening to Rogan/Jones and gave him a lot of misinformation that came at the time he was individuating from family. We just bought off grid land to homestead on, and he really loves being outside and doing woods survivalist stuff, so I'm hoping he'll want to be there and get away from being online playing video games and listening to the weird conspiracy podcasts so often.

I'm a walking testament to this as my life is pretty much in shambles after having a neck injury misdiagnosed, denied treatment, and also mistreated. I now know that I have two degenerated discs, a bulging disc, and a muscular imbalance exacerbating the issue, but it really sucked dealing with all of this and having insurance deny MRIs and having doctors tell me there's 0% possibility of disc damage and neck pain is normal so then I become depressed and just start working less slowly becoming homeless. That's America for a lot of people.\n\nEDIT: some people are assuming I'm making direct comments about slavery when I say subjugation..

Pretty much every monarch throughout history has had to have the support of influential people to maintain power. Even within your example of pre-revolutionary France as an absolute monarchy, king Louis had the support of the nobility. \n\nAnd despotism doesn\u2019t necessarily refer to a government that is cruel or unpopular, it just means a government in which a single ruler or head of state has absolute power. \n\nAbsolute monarchy doesn\u2019t just refer to France. The term has been used to describe the Ottoman Sultans, the Tsars of Russia, Emperors of China, and many Kings and Queens of Europe. The main qualifiers for an absolute monarchy are that a single person, usually as a part of a dynasty or hereditary succession, wields supreme power and has final say in their government. It is pretty widely accepted that Tsar Nicholas II was the last absolute monarch in Europe.",

While a feudal monarch has power, that power is at the will of his lords. To be clear *legitimacy* here means the \"popular acceptance\". In a feudal system that comes from your lords who are also your army. While feudal kings may have claimed supreme power, the reality was that they only wielded the power permitted by their lords.\n\n5. Nicholas I was not an absolute monarch. In the wake of the Crimean defeat Alexander II established elected assemblies to govern rural then urban communities. Peter to Alexander I yes, and arguably earlier too.

Sovereignty is an important concept in international relations, but its precise meaning is contested. There is no formal definition of sovereignty or a sovereign nation defined in international law or contained in a single treaty. However, there are commonly accepted characteristics of sovereign nations, which help to identify and understand sovereignty.\u201d\n\nhttps://study.com/learn/lesson/what-is-a-sovereign-nation.html",

I believe in 1754 Thomas Jefferson was lauding the Iroquois and lambasting the colonies for not being able to be assemble a government as good as them. \n\nBy early 1800s John Adam was remarking how the US was the first democracy. How quickly they forget where they even got the ideas for the constitution from.\n\n\n>In addition, Benjamin Franklin, a key American revolutionary thinker, is shown to have been profoundly influenced by the political thought of the Iroquois in both his public and private correspondence (Grinde, Johansen 98). There were also 200 Indians present at the Albany Conference in 1754 (Grinde, Johansen 105) resulting in the Albany Plan of Union. The Albany Plan influenced the Articles of Confederation, at which time many Iroquois delegates were also present while the plan for the independence of the colonies was being debated (Grinde, Johansen 145).\nhttp://www.powwows.com/2011/09/29/native-americans-influenced-american-political-thought/",

And their privacy will not be protected (anonymity) and they can not defended their actions in court using whistleblower status.\n\nThat is why cartels can have their headquarters in Switzerland. Like FIFA. \n\nBanks can help you avoid paying tax. \n\nDictators can transfer their countries pension funds to their personal bank account in Switzerland. \n\nA company like Amazon can employ a full time carpenter and tell him to sit in an office in Zug and join conference calls when new innovations are discussed. That way Amazon can avoid paying world wide tax on IP. \n\nA pedophile can live in Switzerland since they are neutral and escape punishment and their victims will never see justice.\n\nYou can be a charitable organization, like the Red Cross and never have to show your accounts to anybody. Transparency is not tolerated and are only required to be agreed by the person sitting in an office in Switzerland. Even if the accountants are in Panama, management in Paris and lawyers in London.\n\nYou can be a Russian Oligarch with an Italian girl friend who opens an anonymous bank account. When they open it they can show fake papers showing that they are a legal partnership. That account will not be sanctioned under current Russian sanctions because the owner is Italian. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nSo they democratically agreed to abolish the rule of law. The only law that is still protected is the right to vote to establish the rule of law perhaps again in the future.\n\nSo you can see others commit all types of crimes as long as nobody say something about it. And when you say something about it you are accused of being a traitor.",

If we want to talk about how that position changed over the course of the Roman Republic\u2019s long history that is another conversation entirely.

The whole point of this Spotify ordeal that you mentioned previously was about removing his voice, aka censorship. I'm sure you'd fully support that since it enrages you that he talks to people you politically disagree with. I'm all for people voicing their opinions and supporting people they believe in and if enough people hate Joe's content then maybe he will get cancelled. No sane and good person supports racists or racist discourse (which Joe hasn't done) but you can keep eating up those headlines and virtue signaling because he has questionable guests on but I've never heard any of this racist discourse you mention that he is supposedly platforming on his show. And idk wtf you are talking about with my ideology you fucking weirdo. Just because I think the bad podcast man can have bad guests on his show that must signal to my political views.

A normal person, when saying they're no expert, would shut their fucking mouth. They would go \"I don't know enough on this to talk\" and end it there.\n\nHis \"experts\" are also frequently only \"experts\" in the exact same way he is. They're well known but not terribly authoritative on the topic. There's a reason he's never had legitimate virologists on there to explain why he's a fucking dumbass about vaccines and masks. There's a reason he only brings on other \"libertarians,\" which is basically the absolute lowest rung of political expertise.\n\nHowever, I am zero percent surprised that you've got your head so far up Joe's ass that you can't believe anyone might actually listen to a full episode and still be able to see what a dipshit he is.",

Rogan is literally a rich white fail-upper telling his gullible audience that Covid is no big deal because he survived it with a treatment that the average American can't afford and won't get. He's a stupid piece of shit, for that alone.",

Right wingers aren't just stupid; they're stupid pieces of shit. You're the ones who don't deserve sympathy, because you're malicious cretins who actively make the world a worse place.\n\n> Covid deaths do not \"add\" when the are almost always accompanied by a more serious co morbid condition\n\nUh, no, you just made that up. And even if it were true, comorbidities don't mean the person was going to die soon anyway. Nearly all Americans have one or more comorbidities. I already explained this, and the data for excess deaths comes straight from the CDC.\n\nYou're too stupid to argue with. Impervious to reality. Bye.",

Unfortunately some of the people he chats to spout absolute bullshit and he's not educated enough to realise this/sort shit that sounds good from actual facts. Makes for great interviews as people feel really comfortable opening up to him. The problem comes when people go \"Oh Joe is so charismatic and open minded\" (which is true) \"I should believe everything he says as he'd never lie to me\" (Which is only half true, I don't think Joe has it in him to deceive people, but he is so open to any idea that he himself is often wrong without realising it).The guy isn't a scientist, he doesn't follow facts, he follows shit people say that sounds good to him. He is hillarious in his stand-up and his interviews are great, but he's far from someone you should take as a legitimate source of information. Information should come from peer reviewed papers, but as that is often time consuming, when you can't do that, your information should come from people who are proven to get their information only from peer reviewed papers without a personal agenda (which I don't think Joe has, but nor does he have the correct info as his sources are just anyone he talks to).",

I've listened to a few episodes because I was interested in the subject area and found him to be easily one of the worst interviewers I've ever heard.  \nHis preparation was clearly lacking and he was unable to understand what was being said well enough to ask meaningful questions. When something the interviewee said was inconsistent, he didn't notice.   \nNot only that, his rightly maligned obsession with a few subject areas (What do you know about DMT?) makes clear his inability to tailor an interview to the subject.  \nOverall there's a reason his podcast is favoured by charlatans, and it's because his style of interviewing is suitable only for someone who has a rant locked and loaded.

He was a great podcaster because he had interesting guests and he knew how to ask questions to get the most out of them. I think he genuinely just wants to get the most real and accurate information and years ago that's what he did.\n\nBut then he starts surrounding himself with people that support his opinions and viewpoints and it became insufferable to listen to. \n\nWhen \"the get changers\" move came out he has Chris kresser, a chiropractor, on to \"debunk\" the film. Then to refute the claims Chris made, because he isn't a nutrition expert, they had the movies creator on. He made Chris look like the moron (in relation to nutrition) that he is, hit it's an example of how Joe can't have a guest that truely goes against his viewpoint without backup. He had Joel Kahn, a vegan cardiologist, set up to debate a chiropractor. Joe is terrified to be in a room with a plant based diet expert alone because he knows many of his arguments wouldn't hold weight.\n\nThat's just two small examples, but examples of how Joe's podcast is no longer listening to experts and instead just perpetuating Joe's own viewpoints",

The people with less knowledge will rank themselves in a higher percentile then the test shows, and the people with more knowledge in a lower.

Is it his fault? Is it listeners' fault for treating what he says as gospel? Is it only his fault when he gained a certain amount of followers, and if so, what should he have done / be doing? \n\nI'm not a fan of Joe Rogan, but the topic of misinformation is fascinating to me.

I don't like him, but not because of his misinformation, I think people should be allowed to say every dumb thing they want to say. And in his show, it's pretty clear that he's speculating and spouting bullshit like a drunk uncle at thanksgiving. BUT ---\n\nBut if people believe it, what do you do? An FCC-forced corrections segment at the end of every episode could be one thing, but you're right, nobody would listen to it.\n\nThere are bound to be more Joe Rogans in the future. And with more and more people digesting informal colloquially-communicated information from comedians, from twitter, etc, instead of real newscasters, how do you police the misinformation?\n\nA non-government-based subversive idea would be to start a response podcast to Joe Rogan (for the audience that hates him), hosted by a famous personality, that not only fact-checks him, but uses those fact-checking as a jumping-off point to have real politicians and journalists on. Each episode is based off a wrong Joe Rogan \"fact,\" and they do a deep dive into the truth on the subject.\n\nOf course, that wouldn't stop Joe's loyal audience from believing him.",

Your naked democracy sheep example also doesn't work because Americans are in fact people, and there is more than 3, though I do agree that representative democracy works best, but direct democracy, as it is actually called holds a very important place in democratic society too, for politicians can only represent people so well, on individual, though vitally important matters, it is better to call a referendum (not actually sure if you have many of these in America).

In the later, you have to hope that the restrictions are implemented and maintained by a benevolent, disinterested party.\n\nSo while the former is difficult because people suck, the latter is impossible because people suck. For reference, some post-Civil War southern states used to require black voters pass a literacy test before voting (white voters didn't have to as they were \"grandfathered\" into voting in the literal sense that if your grandfather could vote, you could vote). A university professor got ahold of one of these tests and sent it to colleagues across the nation. 70% of the university professors failed.\n\n(As for representative democracy, well that's another layer of dipshits elected by the other dipshits. It's always about the quality of dipshits.)",

Viewing the world solely through a lens of democracy = competence is incredibly naive. \n\nDemocracy isn\u2019t an absolute good, not is a autocratic government an absolute bad necessarily. Guys like Ataturk and Deng are often hailed as some of the most competent statesmen who ever lived and they utterly transformed their countries. Places like India and various African countries have had extremely problematic issues with democracy since their inception; sectarianism, corruption, and incompetence is rife and its hard to fault them when they had a western institution lobbed onto them with zero regard for local customs and organic growth. \n\nJoe Rogan is a moron who\u2019s worldview is closer to GI Joe than reality.",

I judge Rogan the same way I would judge someone who remains friends with David Duke. Rogan is completely on board Alex's crazy conspiracy theories. Episodes with Jones he literally just yes ands him the entire time, buying into all of his batshit takes like they are gospel.

I have listened to probably 100s of hours of Alex Jones between tuning in for my own curiosity and through an amazing podcast called Knowledge Fight. They go through 1-3 episodes of Info Wars every episode with usually a 2 episode per week release schedule. I highly recommend because it is very entertaining with the host and they dissect claim by claim how Alex Jones just spouts complete nonsense when he is not propagating actual violent rhetoric. He has been sued by the family of Sandy Hook victims because he called them actors who were part of a false flag operation and hearing the father who's son was killed talking about his harassment from Jones followers might be one of the saddest things I've ever listened to in my entire life. Just this week Alex Jones called Putin one of the most honest political figures he's ever heard and blamed trans people existing for why Russia is the good guy for going against \"globalist\". And just so you know globalist is just a dog whistle for Jews. Him and his lackeys are the reason Pizzagate was a thing and one of his listeners tried to infiltrate the pizza place with weapons to \"rescue\" children from a basement that doesn't even exist. If you listen to the interrogation from many domestic terrorist they will list Jones as an inspiration as well as many manifestos siting him as well. He is one of the most dangerous public figures of our time and is not just a funny \"the frogs are gay\" meme.",

If people think they're getting useful information from a podcast like his, then they're just going to get their stupid information from someone just as dumb or dumber. \n\nAnd it should also be noted that \"antivax\" has a different meaning than it did a few years ago. It used to mean that you were against vaccination in general. Then you could be vaccinated for everything but covid and be called antivax. Now it seems like even if you have the shots, just questioning whether the pharmaceutical companies have our best interests in mind, or believing that they're exploiting a terrible situation for profit and have a pretty big interest in keeping the cash flowing can get you labeled an antivaxxer, conspiracy theorist, right wing, etc. \n\nI still think Rogan's says a lot of stupid shit and is irresponsible at times with his listenership, but a lot of things that have been said about him have been twisted around, taken out of context, or outright untrue. And the idea that every single one of his listeners is so stupid that they'll make decisions based on a podcast is silly. The ones who would will take stupid advice from anybody.",

Then he started getting sucked in by it and it got more frequent. Then covid happened and broke his fucking mind for good. I listened to him somewhat regularly for years but then it got to be too much. The \"don't listen to me, I'm just a dumb comedian\" disclaimer was more acceptable years ago.

MOST podcasts are just a couple of people rambling, and plenty have distinguished guests on them.  He didn't do anything special or unique.\n\nThe only reason he got traction was because of his frat-boy-comedian's-club podcasts which generated enough of an audience that it put him on the circuit for people promoting their books.  And eventually, you ended up with people like Brian Cox and Richard Dawkins and Neil Degrasse Tyson (who has admitted to using Rogan just for the exposure) legitimizing him.\n\nI used to like Joe when it was just stupid comedians complaining about their lives (although Tom Segura and Bill Burr were the only real comedians of any worth).  But once he became a platform for marketing, he started a whole new direction that ended him up where he is now.\n\nAnd all along the way he never got any smarter or any better.  He's still an awful host.  But because he does the bare minimum in a conversation, his followers think he's some sort of interview pariah.",

Texas is great but has some darker, ignorant shades and I don't think Rogan has a good enough bullshit radar, especially now that everyone wants to use his platform and treat him like a King.\n\nIt's really unfortunate, I really miss the earlier years.",

I still like JR but I don't listen to his show anymore. Never took medical advice from him but I think people might be taking medical advice from the more professional looking quacks on his show.

C'mon man how can you really think that the millions of people who listen to him every day don't end up espousing some of the nonsense he says? Good lord Aaron Rogers says he takes medical advice from him. Disturbing indeed but makes the point. \n\nIt's just a naive viewpoint. Alex Jones had the exact same argument, 'just asking questions.' Yet we all know that whack jobs take these people seriously. They start physically threatening parents of murdered children over said questions. It's human nature. You really think he's getting paid that much money with that many sponsors if it isn't having a tangible effect? Really? \n\nSaying heinous, dangerous, nonsense for a few hours then at the end saying 'but don't take my word for it I'm dumb' in no way absolves him of what says.",

What\u2019s Joe\u2019s show about? Well, it\u2019s mostly about getting high and talking about Bigfoot. \n\nJoe\u2019s never taken himself seriously, his fans don\u2019t take him seriously, the only people that take him seriously are people that have been misled about who he is and what his show is about.",

Can people not simply enjoy different things than you?\n\nYou know who I think are the real people getting scammed? The people that are being led to believe Joe Rogan is some sort of rightwing news figure like Bill O\u2019Reilly or Rush Limbaugh or something. A common stripe I notice among them is a complete lack of knowledge in regards to the actual content of Rogans podcast. If they ever actually listened to the show (outside of curated clips to craft the aforementioned narrative) they\u2019d realize the dude\u2019s a liberal, and his show is literally about nothing but having pleasant conversations with people about...anything. It\u2019s not some sort of lifestyle thing like people think it is lol",

I think it's one thing to have controversial guests and another to let them spread misinformation, especially since he always claimed to call out bullshit - which he only did when it collided with his own views. Obviously, he is not a trained journalist so no real expectations here, but he used to be a bit more inquisitive when the conversation took a weird turn. \n\nI stopped watching/listening a while back, so it was kind of shocking to see what he's like these days. Maybe he always was, but I feel like he became more extreme. A lot more. I also can't tell if it's just an act or if he fully believes all the nonsense he is spouting. And I honestly don't care. It's disappointing to see the fast decline though and that he is now actively pushing misinformation.",

Huge amount of \"available\" (easily to steal) land, not only a resource unto itself but also helped foster unusually pro-immigration attitudes.  So the US population grew faster than people had babies.  And this is still true: fertility rates across the entire world are declining and they're especially bad in rich countries.  But the US isn't facing a huge population decline because it admits a lot of immigrants (ditto for Canada, Australia, some others).\n\nPlus being very far from other great powers, relatively workable political institutions (except for that one time we all murdered each other because some of us wanted to keep slaves), tons of stuff.  Plus you have to wonder why didn't Brazil or Argentina or etc. become the world superpower.  It's not super clear IMHO.",

That allowed us to build the biggest, meanest, most insatiable military industrial complex (MIC), which made us a superpower. \n\nWith the East vs West Cold War we weaponized every possible cabinet.. and one of the biggest successes was the Department of Agriculture. We tossed away much of our democracy and our free capitalism in order to subsidize the military and agriculture to beat the Russians. We paid farmers to grow crops and livestock that nobody even needed. \n\nThe modern day Supermarket (and the resulting overwhelming obesity problem) is an intentional weapon of war born directly out of corporate socialism for big agriculture.  It was invented specifically to win the worldwide culture war.  \n\nRussians got bread lines and we got supermarkets just to win the war of hearts and minds.  Everyone loves excess. \n\nWe gave up affordable healthcare and well funded educations to make way for the MIC to drop bombs on foreign nations and to build thousands of domestic shrines to the food pyramid (a lie).\n\nLook at who's siding with the East vs West now. \n\nWe're clearly winning, but at what cost?",

I don't think it's a 'mistake', and I certainly don't think the man's an 'idiot'. I think that's absurd. \n\nThanks to Jordan Peterson, I know where I stand on a lot of issues.

Then occasionally one with a comedian or celebrity. Then I cut the comedians and celebrities because it was a brain melt, but kept watching the educators and experts. Then he got his Spotify deal so I stopped watching completely. Didn't think too much about him until the Corona virus happened and he started popping up and spewed some really insane stupidity.\n\nNormally I didn't think too about much about Rogan's insanity. Usually the guest would squash them (when it was an expert) or it was an obvious conversation between two dudes in a room having a drink. In fact, he used to preface things with like \"As far as I understand it...\" when it was a subject he wasn't sure about or an expert on.  I don't really see him do that anymore. Then again, I don't watch/listen to him anymore so maybe he does and the clips we see exclude that?",

He moved to TX, shortly after he got the Spotify deal, and it has been downhill. \n\nHaven't bothered since. \n\nIt's tough to have consistent quality for a long period regardless. He has an odd tendency to want to discuss a limited set of topics, but only touch surface level on them. Which gets stale rather quickly. \n\nIt's only ever been worth listening to in episodes that he has an interesting guest that can keep the focus on their topic in between Rogan rants.",

There are a couple good episodes with NDT, but then in the last one he talked over him a bunch. At the same time, I can't get behind him giving a platform to people like Alex Jones in the slightest. There's a clip where Joe may have even had a decent guest on, but Joe disagreed with the guy, Jamie looked into it and proved Joe wrong, and Joe basically acted like it was a matter of opinion while two people who knew he was factually wrong were disagreeing with him. Just not interested in Joe, the move to Spotify, his recent selection of guests, his ideas, his arrogance. A lot of that wasn't great when I did watch, but when he had guests on who were knowledgeable about things he was interested in, he shined because he asked good questions and let the person talk. I just don't get that vibe anymore and instead it seems like he's just embraced the things I didn't like.",

He made a statement saying that when he brings a controversial guest on, he\u2019ll start bringing in someone opposite to balance them out. Of course he has some clips where he says very stupid things or shows heavy confirmation bias. But to me, that\u2019s pretty much expected from anyone who puts out hours of content a day.",

The majority voting only happened when women got suffrage. \n\nSo I'll  it's argue Finland,  New Zealand or Norway. \n\nNew Zealand was the first country where most of the population could vote. Finland was the first country where they could also run for office. And Norway was the first \"real\" country that did these things.

This emerges primarily from the matter of language\u2013 part of the effect and legacy of British economic, legal and cultural hegemony is that the English language had, by the mid 19th century, replaced French as the 'lingua franca', and became an increasingly necessary tool to engage internationally. This accelerated during the technological and informational revolution post-Marconi's invention of the radio, and indeed from before with Gutenberg's printing press.\n\nSo with American cultural hegemony, how much of it emerges from the legacy of the British Empire making English the most spoken second language in the world and first language of 5/10 largest economies of the 20th century? How much emerges from the legacy of English literature, the UK inventions of TV, telephone, animation and world wide web? Or the anglo-french development of photography? Or the anglo-french-american development of film cameras?\n\nDividing where America became the primary proponent of anglosphere culture is difficult. Even today, the line between Hollywood and London for film and tv is highly diffuse. Look where Star Wars is made rather than who owns the IP, for example.",

The empire\u2019s strength was dependent on them maintaining a pre-20th century world, ie one where subjugate imperialism was basically still ok. It was an empire equipped and evolved to be the strongest 19th century great power and times were swiftly changing. Nationalist movements were already sweeping through the colonial world before the war. And of course the very liberal democratic principles that the uk was fighting for in the war implied a sunsetting of empire. \n\nWhereas the US\u2019s strength was much less contingent on active imperialism because of the simple delta of land and population and resources. \n\nSo I disagree it was a matter of buts and maybes, more whens and hows.",

South America, for example, was considered by Hobsbawm, AG Hopkins and others an \"informal part of the British Empire\". While conquering a continent that had, with British money in part, kicked Spain and other powers out, would be expensive and morally difficult to justify in London, the UK instead made the continent economically suzerain to London, as well as sending many colonists. In 1850 about a third of all South American imports and exports, full stop, were with the British. This was more extreme with countries like Argentina, where more than half of trade was with the British Empire, while Parliament reported there were more Glaswegians in Argentina than in Glasgow. \n\nThis \"informal\" empire played out from South America to the parts of Africa not directly ruled by the British, to Asia. Indeed, even the US post independence experienced most of its debts and investment being handled through the British Empire, part of the reasons the UK did not seek to reconquer, but instead finance the new state.\n\nCountries like China did not experience direct rule, but were suzerain to the British Empire, leading to what is known in China as the 'century of humiliation'. The British Navy was able to operate with impunity, and British business was allowed privileges within China, whether the government liked it or not. This pattern of economic and cultural hegemony played out across the world, much as it does for America. Equally, the British Empire led to the establishment of english as the global language, the anglo-saxon economic system as arguably the most influential, common law as the main legal system in the Empire, then Commonwealth, and in the US. Further, and of interest, most democracies established in the 20th century were modelled at least in part on the Westminster system, while the US system remains largely uncopied, as a cultural legacy of that empire.",

They basically fucked them up big time, and in terms of the conception of Russia's place in the world it still influences them a lot. For example by essentially losing their state it encouraged a greater reliance on the Orthodox church, which has played a role in political authority in Russia ever since (Putin still uses Patriarch Kirill for political legitimacy). 'God given' or authoritarian right to rule, either via the Church or a central power (e.g. Communist Party) still looms large in Russian political culture.\n\nThe Mongols destroyed the proto-democracy of the Kievan Rus, which has essentially condemned Russia to only one viable political system to survive since, autocracy.\n\nIt moved the center of proto-Russian culture from what is now Kyiv to Moscow, which of course has had a profound impact on the diverging populations, languages, and national identities of the region. Power also moved from Novgorod to Moscow, which still influences modern Russia.\n\nIt also contributed to a Russian sense of historic insecurity- for all the memes, Russia has never shaken the sense of its conquerability, not helped by Napoleon or Hitler's ability to sweep so quickly towards Moscow.\n\nIt also kinda ruined Russia's chances of establishing itself as the major European power, leaving room for Germanic, French and later British influence. Instead Russia had to look east, and ever since has struggled to manage a difficult geography that often costs more to run that it profits of its own land, and a cultural tension between European and 'slavic'/east of Ural Russia.\n\nThat's all shorthand though I'm afraid, and other people know way more than I do. Worth googling or finding a good book on the influence of the Mongolian Empire on the development of Russia though. Also this lecture is an amazing primer into how Russia has come to see its geopolitical place in the world, and covers the impact of the Mongol invasion in influencing Russian cultural and nationalist paranoia. The second half gets more into political organisation than background, so maybe only the first 20 mins is relevant https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF9KretXqJw&ab_channel=fin_topsu\n\nSorry to not be much help today!",

The British Empire is older than the US as a country *and* as a superpower. The British Empire was *the* top dog internationally from the 1700s until late WW2. Yes, only that long ago. Face it - the mighty US of A is very powerful, but there is no conceivable way that it will ever reach the same heights the British Empire did, due to the extinction of literal imperialism (obvs financial imperialism etc. still occurs, I know).",

Adjusting, it\u2019s not even close.  You look at multiple factors of a hegemony to determine overall power:\n\n1) Military might: person for person, it\u2019s not even close - the US military has over 3 million people.  The British hegemony would have LOVED to have that many.  Next we would look at tech vs competitors, US again is further ahead.  The British advantage was logistical more than massive technical advantages.  \n\n2) economy - this isn\u2019t even close to a discussion, anything other is pure ignorance.  The US is the largest economy to ever exist.  The stranglehold they have in banking would make Bank of England salavate to even have a shred of the power the US holds as THE reserve currency.  Want oil? It\u2019s priced in USD, doesn\u2019t matter if you aren\u2019t trading it in the US, it\u2019s still gotta be in USD currency.   Practically every single god damn country in the world has USD in its reserves so they can purchase goods.  That was never the case for the British empire.\n\n3) Manufacturing - again, another slam dunk for the US - as a factor of per person, even adjusted. US manufacturing is the highest in the world, at any point.  This is simple economic analysis.  Britain\u2019s manufacturing was good, but not great - they were just ahead of the curve and were able to use colonies for resources.\n\nThere is in no way that they compete.  You\u2019re fooling yourself if you attempt to argue otherwise",

The British Army may not have had 3 million men at its peak, but it was definitely *proportionately for the era* a huge military force, and that is before you weigh in the armies the British could call upon from its colonies, leaving it with one of the single greatest gross military force, overshadowing the US military.\nAs for \u201ctech vs. competition\u201d the US military isn\u2019t really *that much* further ahead than its allies namely NATO and **the UK**, due to technology sharing and standardisation (for example, the British Army uses AH64s, of US origin, the US Army uses the British 105mm field gun). During the Industrial Revolution, the British were *miles* ahead than the competition in so many factors.\n\n2. You said the US is the largest economy in the world. Correct. However, the British Empire was the largest economy in the world as well. For longer. So you have a flaw in your argument. You said that the universal trading currency is USD. Well the Pound Sterling was the first universal trading currency and held the position for a *lot* longer until it gave it up. So that point is null.\n\n3. Manufacturing. Ever heard over the Industrial Revolution? The US didn\u2019t start that. The Brits did. They then used that to their advantage for over 100 years. The US makes a lot of stuff, I get it. But you really need to understand *how* to adjust for the time period before you make you comparisons.",

Remove the US and Russia is a larger military. \n\nOk so let\u2019s look proportionately - the US spends more on its military than the next 10 counties COMBINED, and 9 are allies.  Each separate faction of the US military would alone be considered the largest military power in the world.  The issue you are having is you really have no real concept of the absolute size of the military.  One aircraft carrier group is comparable to most nations full military in terms of equivalent fire power.  Only a few nations have 1\u2026 we have 9 active and 6 more that can be put active rather quickly.  You are massively underestimating the US military force.  The US military is the only military force EVER that was designed to fight in multiple theaters of full scale was at once.  Let that sink in - not multiple\nFronts - multiple theaters.  That means it is designed to have a full scale war in multiple places at the same time across the globe.  Dude it\u2019s not even close.\n\n2) you have a point that the pound sterling was a  MAJOR player!  It\u2019s why I firmly believe that the British hegemony is a firm #2\u2026. What you miss is how reserves work.  You don\u2019t do trade if you don\u2019t have USD\u2026 if you didn\u2019t have pound sterling, you could use gold\u2026 actually 2/3 of the world never used a pound sterling at all\u2026 but EVERY country that isn\u2019t under US sanctions uses the USD for trade - every.  That is a massive difference.  If you made 33% of your shots in basketball and I made 98% - who would be picked first.  Yea, they were strong, but again, it is literally not even a remotely close competition.  The only other factor is length, this isn\u2019t a reasonable comparison, as US hegemony has not ended yet - if you want to do time, let\u2019s compare each in their first 70 years (US from 1950, when they really started their rise to superpower)\n\n3) ok ok - every hear of GPS? The internet? The entire technology revolution?  The US started that\u2026 I can adjust fine, you have a clear understanding what happened a while ago? But clearly are lost to what has happen in the past 50 years\u2026.",

                              "text": "1. The US Military doctrine is highly, and I mean highly, based upon lessons learnt in the Pacific theatre. The doctrine going into WW2 for the US is very old school, behind the times, not superpower stuff. Coming out of WW2, the US Military doctrine is all about **power projection**, and is hegemon stock really - can\u2019t underestimate that. This means they prioritise the ability to show force in a theatre globally, rapidly and powerfully. This, however, doesn\u2019t mean they are the ultimate warriors of the modern era. It simply means compared to *any other nation* the US is the best at this, throughout history. The British Empire had a different focus, and so can\u2019t be compared on just that factor. Also remember, bigger isn\u2019t always better. Iraq had the 4th largest army in the world, but they got whooped by a coalition a fraction of the size. I am saying that although the US is the largest and most powerful military ever, that doesn\u2019t mean they have had the most international effect, importance or power in history. That still goes to the Brits.\n\n2. I do understand how reserves work, but I\u2019ll finish my response to your point briefly here as this isn\u2019t my specialty: reserve use has changed over time, so it isn\u2019t that simple. Again, I\u2019m not saying the US is financially weak, but merely that you need to recognise the *influence* the British Empire made to global affairs over its span.\n\n3. Look it up: the internet is a British invention (Sir Tim Berners Lee).The Industrial Revolution I keep coming back to is, I would argue, the *most* revolutionary series of inventions to influence human history, which is *almost* rivalled by the computer age. The US couldn\u2019t be changing the world with the Apple Mac if it wasn\u2019t for Henry Bessemer changing how steel would be made for the rest of history, would they?",

The British empire was naturally monopolistic, they wanted to control resources through occupation. This is why their impact is easier to see and understand.  The US projection of force is two fold - first is the obvious hegemonic projection of might - the second and less obvious one is keeping trade lines open\u2026 this allowed for the growth of global trading to increase.  This is also a second for of projection - you see it globally, Americanization.\n\n2) Global finance is a specialty of mine (I have been trading forex for over a decade). The idea of a global reserve as a currency didn\u2019t exist before the US - prior to that it was gold and silver.  The USD is the first currency used as a global reserve - this allows for unprecedented power in the currency that if broken down would blow most peoples minds.  This is why I give the economy to the US, being the global reserve is honestly a cheat code.\n\n3) Tim Berners Lee invented the World Wide Web in the 90s\u2026 it\u2019s a part of the internet, but the internet existed years prior.  TCP/IP protocol was invented in 1983 (www used that protocol) and 1969 was when ARPANET first created what would later be called the internet.  \n\nIf you want to hop into manufacturing then US invented:\n\nInterchangeable parts\n\nThe assembly line\n\nThe telephone\n\nComputer Aided Design\n\n3D printing\n\nAll of these are massive changes in manufacturing technology.  The first two being comparable to steam power in terms of output value.\n\nAlso pinning stuff back is never good or else this discussion goes back to Ugg who discovered how to harness and control fire.",

Cool to know that this (finance) is your specialty! I\u2019ll leave that to you then, eh?\n3. Minor bungle with Timmy, you\u2019re right. However, British computer influence spans for decades longer than the Americans, (mostly on the mathematical side, as opposed to logistical) and if you *really* want to prove a point, then I could say that Babbage and Lovelaces\u2019 calculations/formulas presented computational groundwork unheard of since the Ancient Greeks.\n\nFinal point. You list these inventions, yet how many of these had a superpower-esque influence *when the US was a hegemon*. Two. Whereas the amount of technological impact the world received via the British Empire during their heyday really take the biscuit.\n\nAlso, mini extra point not really directed at you: it is vital that if people want to argue the US\u2019s superpower status as #1, that you understand *why* and *how* this happened and the preceding position holder: the UK.",

It\u2019s harder to fully understand something until after it is gone.\n\n2) fair - I do highly recommend learning about the reserve system and how the USD operates in it - it\u2019s really one of those things that once you understand it, it kinda pisses you off just how unfair it is.\n\n3) I have no argument - British mathematics has been integral to many of the modern technologies.  My point was purely that the technological revolution was really a thing driven by the US, much like the industrial revolution was driven by Britain.  It\u2019s still to this day why most tech companies are from the US (Microsoft, IBM, Apple, Oracle, Google, etc)\n\nTo the last point - we don\u2019t know yet.  The US has more patents filed then the rest of the world combined - there are many things that will be add to the list as we are still a current hegemony.\n\nAs a hegemony logistics is where we have the largest impact - GPS (like worldwide) is a US thing, the US government runs it.  Everything you do uses GPS nowadays: your phone, your computer, watches, cars, planes, rockets, etc.  what most people don\u2019t know, is the US government is also capable to turning it off for everyone but them - imagine a world where gps didn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s honestly extremely hard as almost all of what many people in the world depend on, they depend on GPS.\n\nOn that note, I am heading to bed - long day - feel free to post a reply, I\u2019m down to continue when I\u2019m up and about tomorrow.

Athens, whilst not a *country*, functioned as a nation, just like every other city state in the time period, therefore, effectively proving my point that there was democracy in *what functions as a country* for thousands of years before America was even contemplated. I used Athens in this case, because the Athenians coined democracy. So, no, I am strongly disagreeing with Rogan.\nI still stand by my point that the British Empire is the greatest superpower ever known, for reasons debated into eternity in other comments below, *so again*, I am strongly disagreeing with him.",

What those \"pseudo-intellectuals\" are talking about is *folk culture*, that is to say, something that comes uniquely from the land in which it was developed.\n\nEg, Greek culture is the way it is because Greek people learned to survive, organize and entertain themselves in Greece as opposed to somewhere else. They developed tools and weapons made of the Greek landscape, they created music and art about the Greek landscape, made food from animals and plants found in Greece.\n\nAmerica, outside of a few small enclaves, doesn't have that - certainly not in the popular sphere. Even most of our existing folk traditions come from immigrants trying to revere something to which they are no longer connected.\n\nThe closest thing America has to folk culture is probably country music made prior to the 80s and old pioneer stories like Johnny Appleseed that are barely kept alive anymore. There is no American cuisine that uses anything unique to America. There was a 1970s folk revival where the hippies tried to create a new unique folk culture by creating things from the land they lived on, and it was pretty beautiful. And then it got steamrolled by capitalist suits in the 80s and is pretty much dead now.",

Not a patch on France, Spain, UK, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Eastern Europe in that time, let alone Mexico, South America, Asia.

Nobody ever said that the native Nations were representative democracies. But there is more to democracy than representative democracy. There is more to the idea of of governance. The governance of native tribes was well established. Their freedom was well established as well. There is more to the idea of freedom than your biased idea of it. Part of freedom is self-determination. Indigenous people around the world should have the freedom for that. They didn't need  \"established governments\" to \"bring freedom\". The native Nations were completely established, just not according to the people that wanted to take advantage of them.  \n\nNot to mention that even ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN DEFINITION, the video is STILL WRONG.",

I don\u2019t think so buddy. If you\u2019re telling me that all native Americans created a unified government you\u2019re crazy. Writing down law to govern people is certainly not a new idea nor a European one. It\u2019s been in practice for thousands of years. One of the oldest surviving pieces of law is that of [Code of Lipit-Ishtar] https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Lipit-Ishtar or [Code of Ur-Nammu] https://www.britannica.com/topic/Code-of-Ur-Nammu. I personally believe that Native American tribes did not have an established government, besides that of the Iroquois Confederacy which still is not an example of a democratic government. It\u2019s really not possible to govern a group of people without written law to abide by. Most native tribes were governed by religious traditions or were organized into clans. This however is not an example of government and I believe this is where you are confusing the two.",

I'm white.\nwhen black people come out in support of Joe \"I'm not a doctor but I'm an expert on vaccines\" rogan, it's not me giving him a pass. that's the thermometer. What black people say about him is more important to me tha  what NBC or CNN says.\n\nso saying \"the N word is racist full stop\" doesn't carry a lot of weight with everyone.\n\nthe media does not like alternative mediums of news/entertainment. corporate interests (which in the past were largely republican) don't like losing viewership and control of narrative to a cage fighter commentator. so they go back 12 years and drag his name through the mud.\n\nregarding JPs lecture series. the only thing I ever saw was unless he was told specifically to refer to someone as \"x\" (much like being called by their name, which is *personal*) informally addressing an aquantience by the gender they look like is reasonable IMO.",

That's the truest statement ever made, brother. \n\nThe reason people give us such a hard time is the whole American exceptionalism thing. Those blindly patriotic and toxic individuals are really loud. They aren't the majority, but their bullshit message is what the world hears. It makes for great TV watching a superpower begin to fail. \n\nThere are tons of people who think the USA is the best country in the world and does no wrong. They think pizza is American. They think the internet is American. Etc etc etc, ad infinitum. \n\nIt's those blindly patriotic individuals I'm thinking about. \n\nThe ones visiting Germany yelling, \"USA! USA! USA!\" and whatnot don't help either. \n\nI'm actually a member of r/shitamericansay, and I think it's pretty hilarious. For the most part, we deserve the ridicule. Check it out if you haven't. The vast majority of posts are about those type of idiots who deserve it. \n\nMost people know that not all Americans are like that. \n\nOther people hate us all, but that's another issue altogether. \n\nI don't judge all people of any group with broad strokes. I try to base it on individuals and their merits. Some groups may fit into stereotypes, but that's still not judging the individual. (some stereotypes ring true statistically)\n\nThere are shitty people everywhere. The rest of us should join together and run off the assholes.",

In fact I care about them so much that I straight up told them whenever they'd bring up politics that I wouldn't talk about it with them because we were just too far apart and it wasn't worth it. I could've easily just said fuck it were not friends anymore but I just told them to their faces that all the political shit they posted was annoying as shit but I still loved them and I didn't want it to be an issue. Were all good and strong friends and know that we don't agree politically and they're cool with me not following them dude. I think I'm a great friend to them and vice versa. We're adults about it, I've never hid behind the fact that I find their social media completely fucking annoying. I don't have any interest in festering some weird anger towards them because they keep posting the same stupid fucking conspiracy or anti-vax memes or whatever they do on any given day. If I kept following them I'd eventually have just said adios.

That was one of the many identity factors of the US, not *the* one. There were also many religious values baked into the paradigms of liberty and democracy and good will.\n\nThere is an additional point of inference from your text: implying that the lack of religion is what makes this country great, or that eradicating the religious foundation allowed what Joe Rogan went on about.\n\nIt sounds more like YOU are pissed off at this \u201cparticular faction of people\u201d and materialize your discontent into something historical, broad, and sweeping. \n\nBut let me go back to being a redditor for you: yay religion bad!

All that I have been saying is that talks that try to sound credible without an expert should not be taken at face value and checked. That these should have essentially \"parental guidance ratings\" like movies so that youth and other people who might take this at face value might think more critically (but you are probably right that people won't listen to that anyways and think critically even with a \"viewer discretionis advised\" type of message). \n\nYeah I agree everything should be thought of critically and not taken at face value. \n\nThe fact you think this is something new to me is pretty toxic and is frankly mansplaining given the stance I am saying here.\n\nAnyways dude I'm glad you also agree people need to think critically and fact check. \n\nLater",

Many small tribal and clan groups found around the world have self-governed by democratic or voluntary participation for eons--there are still some today--prior to colonization by European and Asian superpowers and the attendant imposition of modern state externalities (laws, borders, etc.) on their existence.\n\nAnything out of this guy's mouth should be taken with a heaping spoonful of salt.",

If he was arguing that the US is the first nation to have a separation of church and state, *then* he can be as condescending as he wants because Rogan would have been right.\n\nThere have been democracies longer than America has been around. Rome was a democracy before Julius Caesar for 400 years. Athens was a *true* democracy for 200 years (a little less than the USA, but the USA isn\u2019t a true democracy either)\u2026 there\u2019s been democratic nations forever. The United States wasn\u2019t a novel idea in that respect\u2026 they modeled their democracy after Rome. What WAS novel is that the USA is a secular democracy\u2026 which is what asshole over there piped up with in eager defense of Rogan who said nothing of the sort\u2026 which like I told him makes him correct in the argument *he\u2019s* making, but still an asshole because that\u2019s not what anybody is taking about here.",

It consisted of the 39, later 55, go\u00f0ar; each owner of a go\u00f0ar\u00f0; and each hereditary go\u00f0i kept a tight hold on his membership, which could in principle be lent or sold. Thus, for example, when Burnt Njal's stepson wanted to enter it, Njal had to persuade the Althing to enlarge itself so a seat would become available. But as each independent farmer in the country could choose what go\u00f0i represented him, the system could be claimed as an early form of democracy. The Al\u00feing has run nearly continuously to the present day. The Althing was preceded by less elaborate \"things\" (assemblies) all over Northern Europe.[82]\nThe Thing of all Swedes, which took place annually at Uppsala at the end of February or in early March. As in Iceland, the lawspeaker presided over the assemblies, but the Swedish king functioned as a judge. A famous incident took place circa 1018, when King Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung wanted to pursue the war against Norway against the will of the people. \u00deorgn\u00fdr the Lawspeaker reminded the king in a long speech that the power resided with the Swedish people and not with the king. When the king heard the din of swords beating the shields in support of \u00deorgn\u00fdr's speech, he gave in. Adam of Bremen wrote that the people used to obey the king only when they thought his suggestions seemed better, although in war his power was absolute.\nThe Swiss Landsgemeinde.\nIn Norway: Gulating, Borgarting, Eidsivating, Frostating\nThe election of Uthman in the Rashidun Caliphate (7th century).\nThe election of Gopala in the Pala Empire (8th century).\nThe t\u00faatha system in early medieval Ireland. Landowners and the masters of a profession or craft were members of a local assembly, known as a t\u00faath. Each t\u00faath met in annual assembly which approved all common policies, declared war or peace on other tuatha, and accepted the election of a new \"king\"; normally during the old king's lifetime, as a tanist. The new king had to be descended within four generations from a previous king, so this usually became, in practice, a hereditary kingship; although some kingships alternated between lines of cousins. About 80 to 100 t\u00faatha coexisted at any time throughout Ireland. Each t\u00faath controlled a more or less compact area of land which it could pretty much defend from cattle-raids, and this was divided among its members.\nThe Ibadites of Oman, a minority sect distinct from both Sunni and Shia Muslims, have traditionally chosen their leaders via community-wide elections of qualified candidates starting in the 8th century.[83][84] They were distinguished early on in the region by their belief that the ruler needed the consent of the ruled.[85] The leader exercised both religious and secular rule.[84]\nThe Papal election, 1061,\nThe guilds, of economic, social and religious natures, in the later Middle Ages elected officers for yearly terms.\nThe city-states (republics) of medieval Italy, as Venice and Florence, and similar city-states in Switzerland, Flanders and the Hanseatic league had not a modern democratic system but a guild democratic system. The Italian cities in the middle medieval period had \"lobbies war\" democracies without institutional guarantee systems (a full developed balance of powers). During late medieval and renaissance periods, Venice became an oligarchy and others became \"Signorie\". They were, in any case in late medieval times, not nearly as democratic as the Athenian-influenced city-states of Ancient Greece (discussed above), but they served as focal points for early modern democracy.\nVeche, Wiec \u2013 popular assemblies in Slavic countries. In Poland wiece have developed in 1182 into the Sejm \u2013 the Polish parliament. The veche was the highest legislature and judicial authority in the republics of Novgorod until 1478 and Pskov until 1510.\nThe elizate system of the Basque Country in which farmholders of a rural area connected to a particular church would meet to reach decisions on issues affecting the community and to elect representatives to the provincial Batzar Nagusiak/Juntos Generales.[86]\nThe rise of democratic parliaments in England and Scotland: Magna Carta (1215) limiting the authority of powerholders; first representative parliament (1265).[87][88] The Magna Carta implicitly supported what became the English writ of habeas corpus, safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with right to appeal. The emergence of petitioning in the 13th century is some of the earliest evidence of this parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people.",

You sound at least critical enough to dismiss a lot of BS, but your parents, neighbors, friends, siblings, they maybe aren't.

I really don\u2019t think I need to explain that point further.\n\nAnti vaccine rhetoric has been prevalent in this country since they were invented. There was ALWAYS going to be a notable part of the population that would refuse the vaccines. It would be literally impossible to vaccinate every single person at the same time. We would have been in this same situation whether or not Joe Rogan released those episodes. Unless of course you have ACTUAL data that you can provide that shows otherwise.\n\nJoe Rogan has stated multiple times on his show since COVID started that he believes that at risk people should receive the vaccine. His argument was that he didn\u2019t believe that healthy people should have to take it. That\u2019s not the same as anti vax. There is a whole anti vax community out there spewing the idea that no one should receive any vaccines and they\u2019ve been saying that for years. I\u2019ve met plenty of them and they would completely disagree with Joes views on vaccines.",

Would you rather have someone calm and composed like Jordan Peterson representing your views or some douchebag like Ben Shapiro? That's why you think jon Stewart is the left's safety net, it's because he is. But doesn't pander to them at the same time.\n\nI like him because I think he's a man who doesn't compromise on being funny to stick to his convictions or trying to make a point. He doesn't resort to ad hominems while debating and although many on the right acuse him of not being held accountable because they believe he could just fall back on \"oh I'm just a comedian haha..\" I disagree. The fact that I agree with him politically and all the good things he's done a lot for your country's military veterans and 9/11 first responders helps with my opinion of him as well. I wish we had someone like him in my country.",

      "text": "Founding Father\u00a0James Madison\u00a0may have best described the difference between a democracy and a republic:\n\n\u201cIt [the difference] is that in a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government in person: in a republic, they assemble and administer it by their representatives and agents. A democracy, consequently, must be confined to a small spot. A republic may be extended over a large region.\u201d\n\nThe fact that the Founders intended that the United States should function as a representative democracy, rather than a pure democracy is illustrated in Alexander Hamilton\u2019s\u00a0letter of May 19, 1777, to Gouverneur Morris.\n\n\u201cBut a representative democracy, where the right of election is well secured and regulated & the exercise of the legislative, executive and judiciary authorities, is vested in select persons, chosen really and not nominally by the people, will in my opinion be most likely to be happy, regular and durable.\u201d\n\nThe following statement is often used to define the United States' system of government: \"The United States is a republic, not a democracy.\u201d This statement suggests that the concepts and characteristics of republics and democracies can never coexist in a single form of government. However, this is rarely the case. As in the United States, most republics function as blended \u201crepresentational democracies\u201d featuring a democracy\u2019s political powers of the majority tempered by a republic\u2019s system of checks and balances enforced by a constitution that protects the minority from the majority.\n\nTo say that the United States is strictly a democracy suggests that the minority is completely unprotected from the will of the majority, which is not correct.\n\nSo, US as a nation or macro we are a republic but we as a state and local government we are a democracy on a micro level.We collectively assemble to our local government in towns or cities and those towns and cities have mayors who gather the gripes of the public. They now make laws in the micro level. Now the mayor's and governor's get together with their representatives Congress and Senate. The federal level is the republic that uses a federal constitution where representatives take what the local level says or gripes to help make the republic better by acknowledging the micro level where the macro level implements what the micro level needs or wants. Why we the US are the 1st republic to mix a democracy that self governs itself.\n\nFreedoms get lost when we bring in the economic system of socialism. We see that from the pilgrims who saw the worst in society when using socialism. When they used capitalism, they flourished while working in peace with the Native Americans. It's not till the British wanted a piece of the prosperity of the free land. Once they saw money, they wanted the piece of the pie and exploited whites, black, and native Americans all for the king and queen.\n\nAlso, native Americans were not free, they may have roamed the lands \"freely\" but, they had other native American tribes that had territories who used barbarism. The main reason why native Americans were exploited and why there were good or bad native Americans is because they believed in tribalism and that alone tribalism is what helped destroy their own. Most tribes believed in tyranny, authoritarianism, and their own kind or tribe. If you were a different tribe, well they were enemies, and that is why we had a hard time with peace. Most native Americans were used by both countries, but the British used them as weapons of war. There were reasons why the British used them, and they weren't free with the Brits, as they used them as we did too. I think more leftists who were more of the line of Brits use them too. After all Dems fought against American culture, as American culture after the civil war was to end slavery and segregation while Dems fought for slavery and segregation while tearing down the American reconstruction after the civil war.\n\nToday we have socialism in America and that is why we see the worst ine America today. When we bring back capitalism to America then we will see a free nation. We have Oligopolies that hinder our innovation as our oligarchs are politicians who are heavily invested into these Oligopolies. This is why our representatives don't car about banning oil from Russia or why we bend a knee to China. It's because our representatives are too heavily invested so they never let these Oligopolies fail and we let these dictators do what they do.\n\nWe are in a self realization period and that's an enlightenment. We are realizing socialism isn't the answer and the self realization is that capitalism works. Now we see Ukraine and it reminds us what we once were, a nation fighting against tyranny. Russia and Ukraine have had many revolutions, Ukraine unfortunately have been victims of authoritarian tyrants. We as a nation need to find what we once were and what we stand up for because freedom is in us all and freedom out numbers tyranny.",

Also people will rewrite history to rob the US of credit for its achievements. People in these comments are just parading false propaganda in response to what they feel is false propaganda.\n\nGreece and Rome were not founded as democracies, and democratic processes were not central to their laws. They didn't have constitutions. They had dictatorships throughout their history and had periods in which there was the privilege of democracy granted to the population, which could be taken away, and often was. Both Rome and the ancient Greek states were only practicing democracies for tiny percentages of their existence. At best, they had ruling aristocracies at times.\n\nIt's a completely different dynamic from the US being founded with a constitutional democracy that specifically, in its founding document, asserted that people's freedom and rights are not provided by the government, that people are naturally entitled to these rights. \n\nEvery single other major power in the world at that time had monarchs or ruling aristocracies. The US absolutely was unique and set trends in democracy that were then emulated by other countries, including the countries whose citizens are having paroxysms of outrage at this clip from Joe Rogan.",

Saying that a monarchy is a dictatorship is definitely incorrect. \nIs he forgetting about many non European cultures that have entirely different governing systems? I don't think the native American Indians or Polynesian moari are dictatorships. Does he even know what a dictatorship is?. Because I don't think he does \n\nAlso I'd like to point out he claims that the us is the greatest superpower but America is probably the most internally rotten place. It took over 100 years and a civil war to free slaves and then an extra 70-80 years before they finally gave them equal rights. The democratic election system is corrupted by gerrymandering and company buyouts to the point it's now more akin to a oligarchy. Your \"elected\" officials have bought their way into power. Your art and creativity is just the same re hashed shit time and time again to the point even Disney has failed to create anything new or creative in years. It's like watching art eat itself again and again. \n\nYour only innovation is how to wring the people out of more and more money, you and your elected allow big business to control and crush the common man to the point that wait staff have to rely on tips or Amazon drivers have to piss in bottles to make the deliveries on time. You created an agency to break up and shut down unions and now you've created an agency to watch and survail your own people, and agency aided by big businesses like Google and Amazon \n\nThere is no freedom in your country. It is a foul and despicable lie your leaders feed to your populus.ypur all told you can succeed, grow and thrive if you try but here's the thing unless your born into the riches or please the corporate masters you will never get anywhere close.  It's a delusion and the longer you believe it the longer the system will go on . \n\nAmerican exceptionalism is a lie and the only ones who don't know that is the American people.",

And these were 3 hour long conversations. It was incredible.\n\nWhere it all started the fall down in my opinion was when Joe started to think people were listening for him. If the guest couldn't control the conversation it just turned into the Joe Rogan show and he would repeat the same things that he had said a hundred times in previous episodes.\n\nAnd that was harmless, because he was talking about exercising techniques, hunted vs farmed meat, cold shock proteins, smoking weed, how strong chimpanzee is, bow hunting, etc, etc, etc. Annoying to have to listen to, but harmless.\n\nThat's what got me to stop listening. I was actually interested in what his guests had to say but it just ended up being Joe Rogan waiting for an opening and then staying things that I'd heard hundreds of times before about shit I did not care about. \n\nIt's crazy to think that in five short years he's gone from this annoying but harmless \"bro\" who somehow managed to get the most fascinating guests, to this anti vax right wing nut job.",

With all due respect to the U.S.... it didn't really contribute too much to any of these (at least, not until over a hundred years had passed), and by the time America did start making significant contributions, most other developed nations had already taken up democratic republicanism.\n\nThis isn't because Americans are a bunch of creative dummies. The reasons are complex, but one good indicator of creative renown is economic prosperity and dramatic concentrations of wealth (you need rich aristocrats to act as patrons, to pay tickets for your expensive operas, etc). As the post-industrial middle class became wealthy enough to spend money on artistic entertainment, America became hugely influential in the forms of creativity that made use of this (Hollywood, radio, recorded music, television, etc). \n\nPlease, don't go around thinking that American freedoms made Americans better at writing novels.",

The word \u201cdemocracy\u201d comes from two Greek words that mean people (demos) and rule (kratos). Democracy is the idea that the citizens of a country should take an active role in the government of their country and manage it directly or through elected representatives. In addition, it supports the idea that the people can replace their government through peaceful transfers of power rather than violent uprising or revolution. Thus, a key part of democracy is that the people have a voice.\n\nSo, as we always say, don't listen to a fake comedian who has a massive platform to spew nonsense.\n\nWhat's funnier, or scarier, is that he doesn't actually understand why America actually became what it did.\n\nBecause America accepted immigrants and allowed them to create a new life in a new country, many people that were intelligent and looking to leave their countries came to America with the hope that they could do more with their lives.\n\nWhich led to an influx in immigrants that would go on to build the foundation of literally everything we see today.\n\nYet he lives in a state that wants a wall to block all immigrants from entering the country.",

Free Speech. The web has become SUPER saturated with information including from sources such as your own podcast. Speech requires thought derived from the collection of information. The quality of that information has been so diluted and corrupted from the access given to profiteers of the medium that the populous can no longer effectively or easily make up their own mind according to their own reasonable collection of information. That leaves us with several groups. One group, the intellectual assertive, who are capable and willing to vote and are not daunted by the dearth of info. Another group, far too easily willing to succumb to the emotional arguments given and who will vote accordingly. The burned and critical of every politician and topic. And the immobile apathetic. Those who are silent are the final group but this percent seems perennially unimportant to the polls. \n\nSo hearing the idea of a dictator coming from an online dictator of message by volume such as yourself, Mr. Rogan, is hypocritical at the least",

Nor were the lowest of the four classes of Athenian citizens (as defined by the extent of their wealth and property, rather than by birth) eligible to hold public office, through the reforms of Solon.[11][12] The Spartan election of the Ephors, therefore, also predates the reforms of Solon in Athens by approximately 180 years.[13]\u201d",

      "text": "As someone who studied political science i would like to make the point that the US democracy is flawed in many ways, but here the 2 big ones that everyone with basic knowledge in political science will agree with.\n\n1. Voting system is not proportional. Not every vote of every citizen got the same power. That is simply unfair and undemocratic.\n2. i understand US as having one of the most diverse and heterogeneous populations. Usually you would a expect a multi-party consensus democracy and a parliament like in many EU countries. A two party system cannot appropriately represent the interests of its population. Two party-systems are made for a homogenous populations who share one culture.\n\nOther things i like to point out (more kinda my opinion reflecting the idea/intentions that i connect with democracy):\n\n\\- US is not fully secularized, like e.g. France the mother of modern democracies.\n\n\\- US does have a scary inequality in wealth and income. Seems like it does not care about the majority. Democracy is the idea to be the best for the majority. everything is decided by majority votes.\n\n\\- Democracy is shitty but still awesome because interdependent economic relations with other nations is its strength an prevents wars. No real democratic country has every attacked another real democracy (by academic standards) yet.  But the US fought the most attack wars in the 21th century and killed the most foreign civilians in it. They only got attacked by one other nation on there own ground once; Japan.\n\n\\- Otto von Bismarck introduced  mandatory healthcare for all, since healthy people improve the economic outcome. It's a clear winwinwin (gov wins, economy wins, every citizen wins) and most modern countries adapted it. Yet US citizens got tricked into thinking that its a bad thing.\n\nReading american comments defending their political system often feels like someone with stockholm syndrome who keeps hitting themselves while recreating the \"this is fine\" meme.\n\nDon't get me wrong, you don't have to change anything, because it makes shitty EU democracies seem really great in comparison.

These Nations each had their own customs intricately linked to the environment and their neighbouring Nations. Add to this that governance wasn't led by any one individual, but (generally speaking) by elders that held a lifetime of knowledge. \n\nUnfortunately, due to the attempted erasure of these peoples in Australia, a lot of the Languages and knowledge that could have helped inform today's society has been lost. BUT, there are still many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples today that continue to practice their culture, despite ongoing systemic failures. There needs to be a shift in Western society, where educational institutions focus more on what we can learn from these societies that have existed for many millennia. For a start, this country (Australia) could actually respect, embrace and learn from the AMAZINGLY OLD culture/s that continues to live on and evolve today.",

We still don't know much about them, but the hallmarks of unified power - images of battles, palaces, armories, central fortifications, are absent. Instead, there are cities with thousands of roomy houses, public baths and sanitation pipes, all planned on a regular grid. Four or possibly five cities appear to have tens of thousands of inhabitants each, as large as any of the ancient world. The whole civilization was much larger and probably more populous than Egypt or Mesopotamia at the time. This was over 4000 years ago, as far from beginning of the Roman Empire, as that is from us.",

Democracy dates back literally thousands of years before that. Did some of those places fall into autocracy from time to time? Sure but they also existed a lot longer than 200 years.\n\nThe rest is a bunch of horseshit you're taught in high school about how great the USA is. It's American Exceptionalism all the way down.\n\nWhat freedom was there for slaves(also a criticism you can levy at Athenian and Roman republics)? Were the Native Americans free to do as they pleased in the USA? This foundation mythology ignores so much shit that actually happened. Did you know that for the first ~40 years the majority of even white men couldn't vote? Because there was a property requirement to vote. You had to own property. At the end of the Constitutional Convention, the qualifications for voting were white male landowner, that made up about 6% of the population. That was the acceptable \"democracy\" of the founders.\n\nSo this was self-government for a tiny percentage of the population, a good portion of which were slave owners. So really, a lot like the Roman and Athenian republics or the Italian Merchant Republics of Venice, Genoa, Pisa, Amalfi, and a few others.\n\nHell, the Iriquois League predates the formation of the USA by centuries and was on the same damn continent. In order for a treaty to be binding, it had to be ratified by 75% of male voters and 75% of mothers in the various clans.\n\nAnyway, would you like to learn more?",

              "text": "The USA was not the first democracy nor the first government not run by a dictatorship. Sure, the USA implemented some revolutionary ideas proposed by John Locke, but those ideas originate from earlier governments as stated in his Treatises of Government. Even Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams directly reference John Locke and The Iroquois Confederacy in letters, as their inspiration for the first two constitutions.\n\nOur democracy is pretty fucked up too. We don't really have even representational democracy due to gerrymandering, the electoral college, and the Senate. There are more representational forms of democracy and voting too. Also, at the founding of our nation, we didn't even have full democracy or proper representation since only white land owners over 25 could vote only for the president and Congress (not senator). We still can only elect 2/3 of the government (judicial branch is still a no). Not to mention, we still have some of the lowest voter turnout of any democracy (use to be worse), voter suppression, the senate which grossly overrepresents people from some states over others, and the will or makeup of the people is rarely represented.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_democracy\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system",

You can not even say that there are original americans because you all descend from the British, French and local tribes that lived there, only the descendents of the tribes can be call real americans, this races have mixed and nowadays we can say that we are a mixed of this races. \n\nSecond you can not compare a country that has a 100 history from a country who existes since 1143 like Portugal, you dirent have time to have that kind of political shift, you dirent pass through the fases that all the other countris have passed like Old age, Middle Ages, Modern age or Contemporary age.",

And that's not even counting the middle east which has an immense bank of cultural traditions and art, a lot of modern mathematics come from the middle east.

They were nothing compared to the United States at it's founding.\n\nAlso doesn't address the fact that these are two ancient civilizations out of all of human existence. Which was also part of the point that you are blind to.\n\nMost of human civilization has been dominated by conflict where a single ruler, most often, controlled all aspects of daily life for his subjects.\n\nConsider this problem in terms of population over the course of all of human history (110+ billion people) compared to the meager populations of athens and rome, during the small windows of time where they had a fledgling democratic representative (less than a million \"citizens\"). \n\nLiterally every other living human up until the last few hundred years was subjugated and controlled by a chief, warlord, king, emperor, pharaoh, etc.\n\nSo, yes. 99.9% is a conservative estimate being that less than a few million people prior to the 18th century were citizens of a democratic society. Math is hard but use a calculator if you must.\n\nFor all intents and purposes he's absolutely correct.

Sure it may be of a nationalistic tone and verbiage, but there is no serious historian or political scientist that doubts that the United States is the most influential and powerful country the world has ever seen. Just as one example, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a film industry elsewhere in the world that has the reach and permeations as the films Hollywood produces.\n\nYes, we can argue what our power and influence is really attributable too (no physical demolishment of the homeland in 2 world wars, an economic system that was kickstarted by the enslavement of human beings), but the United States is the first oldest federal republic founded on the consent of the governed. That\u2019s what he means when he says all countries before hand we\u2019re led by dictators (in which he means kings, tsars and warlords).\n\nThose are not baseless sentiments.

In fact that statement alone is more than enough to warrant being on this sub. The world had everything from parliamentary democracies (England/UK), to elective monarchies (Holy Roman Empire), to democracies of varying degrees (Venice, Florence, the Hanseatic league) all centuries before the birth of the US. Hell, the Iroquois had (in some instances) a far more representative democracy than the US had in its first 100-150 years, and was even used as a reference for the establishment of the American democracy. Hell, the US isn\u2019t even the first republican superpower in history. The Roman Republic lasted almost 500 years before democratic institutions were chipped away and the empire was formed. \n\nThe freedom argument also completely ignores, as it always does, slavery. Around 3% of the people in America at its founding were enslaved, and the total number of slaves before emancipation would reach 4 million. Freedom for the white, land owning man, perhaps. And even after emancipation, African Americans have consistently been pushed down and made to be inferiors in their own country. It\u2019s hard to have freedom when your country has 200+ years of tradition in treating your people badly, and the institutions that govern those freedoms were made while your people were in bondage. \n\nDifference between positive and negative freedoms deserves a mention here too. The us protects negative freedoms. This isn\u2019t to say negative as in bad though. Negative freedom is the idea that you\u2019re allowed to do what you want. Freedom of opportunity and all that. The problem comes with the wealth inequality, systemic racism, and horrible social programs that plague the US that limit people\u2019s positive freedoms. You\u2019re \u2018free\u2019 to go make a business to make money, but if you\u2019re poor then good luck doing it. You live in a bad neighbourhood? You\u2019re \u2018free\u2019 to just move but good luck with no money. You need surgery for appendicitis or have had some sort of accident where you\u2019re not at fault? You\u2019re \u2018free\u2019 to go get surgery but have fun with crippling debt. \n\nThe United States is the most powerful and most influential country on Earth. That is a fact. Rogan here, though, seems to think that this is a result of the inherent greatness of the people and their institutions. That the American people just sort of came up with their republic all by themselves and that it was the first of its kind on Earth. He believes that all people were given all freedoms by the constitution (of course, if you brought up slavery with him of course he would acknowledge it, but it never seems to get a mention in these big patriotic speeches), and he believes that today the US people are the most free people on earth. None of those assertions are true. He is stating incorrect things. Confidently.",

Consent of the governed is a phrase that just means that the will of the people is what influences government action. It is not a type of government or anything like that, kings for example must maintain the consent of the people to rule or they face revolt. The phrase essentially means that you cannot rely purely on force to govern people. Also the US wouldn't even be the first to govern on those principles, considering plenty of federal republics were founded well before the US (the Dutch come to mind).",

Countries gain power and influence, some to the point of being a superpower that influences the world, but eventually they will fall. America is currently at a high point, and I hope the point gets even higher, but eventually, even after centuries like the romans america will lose this influence somehow. Also you cant say america is more powerful than the Roman empire at its height, and its probably about the same, if not less powerful, than the British or Mongolians at their heights (in my opinion). Maybe in the future, but what he is saying is obviously wrong. We weren't even the first democracy and its not like every single country before us was run by dictators",

Every American pop or metal band are in some way influenced by the Beatles, the Stones, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, The Who etc. Just because the US now has some of the biggest artists in those genres does that mean that they become the source of influence? Not for me. \n\nThat's just one example, but it also doesn't really impact on my greater point that those types of influences on culture etc are not the same as being effectively owned by the British Empire. \n\nTaking taxes and tithes to the crown from everyone in the Empire is a greater impact than Rihanna getting rich from people buying her CDs or Pepsi getting extremely wealthy from selling drinks in other countries imo.",

I will state the key points.\n\n1) He does state \u201cdemocratic country\u201d, which Athens, was not a country\n\n2) Iceland and the Isle of Man both have interesting claims to democracy. Each has a parliamentary body that is over 1,000 years old, making them the longest standing democratic institutions in the world. But Iceland only got its independence in 1944 from Denmark \u2014 and while it is self-governing, the Isle of Man is not a country.\n\n3) Of course, when we\u2019re talking about democracy today, we\u2019re really talking about universal suffrage. New Zealand may have the best claim here \u2014 by 1893, the self-governing colony allowed all women and ethnicities to vote in elections.\n\n[link](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-the-worlds-oldest-democracies/)",

He is human and he is trying to better himself and in the process sharing that experience with you. I don\u2019t think you people truly appreciate how amazing that is. He is giving you access to some of the greatest people on this planet at the moment. Their thoughts, their motivations, their work. He is humanising a lot of these people for you. Sure not all his guests are great minds some of them are just him pissing about with his friends but you do occasionally get some really amazing people on there and Joe is pretty good at probing them.

Until the social and political upheavals of the 19th century, it would not be appropriate to infer that these republics are anything like the republics we know today. Many were de facto elective monarchies controlled by a cadre of elite families such as in Venice and Florence, or enacted laws to establish oligarchic nobility to control a ruling council as in San Marino. Hell, even the Roman Republic had a multi-tier system of citizenship whereby the main route to citizenship for the peoples they conquered was decades of military service. While they may not have had a specific office where a person was endowed with authority in the manner of Rome's emergency powers, these societies exhibit a lot of negative aspects that we would ascribe to dictatorial (or authoritarian, perhaps?) regimes today.\n\nEdit: By 1490, Venice had a population pushing 180 000. In that same century the number of people who got to vote for the Doge, who ruled for life, was less than 50. This is comparable to the UAE of recent years. How is that consistent with a form of government whereby political power resides with the people and their elected representatives? It was in effect an elective monarchy where political power was shared between a few powerful families. How many of us today would like to live in such a republic?",

      "text": "Plenty of replies pointing out that America is not the first democracy (duhhhhhhh) but his second point is interesting.\n\nI posit that America is the cultural behemoth and still standing superpower today due to a combination of colonialism and the world wars.\n\nFrom 1914-1945 most of the world outside Europe was kept down and not allowed to develop themselves as they were colonial possessions. The main areas prior to 1914 where culture originated from and where the world powers lay was Europe. America was seen as a bit of a joke, a bit of a backward hermit country prior to 1917 and their entry into world war 1. \n\nAnyway, both world wars ravaged Europe as it was fought directly there, the entire industrial infrastructure had to be rebuilt, the continent went through a devastating change over the war and post war period (Germany was split in half for almost 50 years for example). Even the UK, despite not being part of the battlegrounds exhausted its industrial and financial output.\n\nAmerica sat back, sent it's men out to war and turned its industry to it but never suffered the losses Europe did. It was not chained to these dying empires like the rest of the world was. By the time decolonisation started happening America had been it's own country and outside the world wars long enough to become a superpower. \n\nAlso to say that the exact opposite of freedom, that being slavery, certainly had a major part to play in America's rise to industrial superpower. You can't ignore how much a massive free of charge workforce will contribute to a country becoming an economic powerhouse. Although abolished by the time of the world wars that ruined everywhere else the foundations of wealth that slavery had generated provided the building blocks for the industrial power to follow.\n\nNot to dismiss the hard work of America. As a country it has produced amazing things and amazing people and getting yourself into being a world superpower for 80 years and staying there is no mean feat. But I hate this idea that America was a plucky country that became a superpower through graft alone (the old self made man myth). The truth is closer to them taking advantage of being in the right place at the right time for their ascension.",
