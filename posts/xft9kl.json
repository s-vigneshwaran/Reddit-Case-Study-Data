You\u2019re definitely attractive so the self esteem thing must be your own perspective because not anyone in this world I think would say you\u2019re not cute. Being attractive gives you a head start as people will naturally gravitate to you if you are open and friendly. The friend situation can be solved if you try pushing yourself into social situations. It\u2019s hard at first especially if you\u2019re an introvert but plenty of good people out there that feel just like you and are looking for connections. Any sort of networking can be a great way to meet people and start building relationships/friendships. I\u2019m an extrovert at work and while networking but otherwise introverted at home. You can absolutely make friends if you\u2019re willing to put yourself out there. After you make that first connection your confidence will sky rocket and make it that much easier. Be genuine and good things will happen for you.",
