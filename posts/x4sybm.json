  "text": "TIFU by telling my gf to go goblin mode on this dick\nReally messed up. I showed my gf videos of animals going goblin mode because it\u2019s one of the best meme types. They just start running around and go nuts. We have a dom/sub relationship with me being dom. Awhile ago we were getting down and I start choking her and told her \u201cI want you to go goblin mode on this dick\u201d. I swear I could pinpoint the exact moment all of the moisture left her body. She asked me to stop so I did. She left the room and locked herself in the bathroom to \u201cquestion her life choices\u201d and now things are awkward. We haven\u2019t had sex in weeks. She ignores the memes I send her. The last thing she said was the internet isn\u2019t real life and she\u2019s having a hard time finding me sexy anymore. I don\u2019t know how I can recover from this. \n\nTL;DR was fucking my gf, told her to go goblin mode on this dick. Turns out that\u2019s the worst thing to say if you do want someone to go goblin mode on you.",

Makes sense.\" than them applying the same logic they would to a dude and ask for the whole story, or question the person telling the story's actions. Plus... if it's a joke and you've been with a person for a while, wouldn't you make a joke that you know THEY are going to laugh at?\n\nMy boyfriend is the type that plays *way* too much. Comedy is how he copes with bad things, celebrates good things, etc. It's like he cannot bring himself to be serious. That's well and good if this was for his own issues (I am and pretty much always have been the \"class clown\" myself in both school and at work so I love screwing around myself), but any time I need some comfort or a modicum of seriousness I can't get it from him without him making a joke first. It's really fucking grating frankly and I end up reacting just like OP's girlfriend because it's just too much - not everyone wants a joke (that isn't even close to their sense of humor, clearly) EVERY TIME during sex, or when they've just received bad news, etc. I feel like it this is real, he made the joke to make himself laugh (not caring about if she does) to tell the story for internet done.\n\nI know a lot of women that have partners that do this. All of them say some variation of, \"I thought it would be funny\". Right. YOU thought it would be funny, and weren't at all worried if the other person would.\n\n**EDIT: At one point I had something serious happen like losing my job. All I wanted was a hug, and my boyfriend started cracking jokes even though I've said multiple times that I would like his support rather than jokes during serious times like that because it feels like he doesn't care when he does this. It never ends.**",

Well, dearie me, how could I?'

Even if it wasn't an issue on its own, it's apparent that the \"joke\" combined with the choking turned her off. \n\nFor someone who likes subbing, there can be a line between someone taking sexy control and feeling like you're just getting messed with or dehumanized. Especially for less experienced subs, it can take a while to distinguish those two sensations and realize having one's boundaries respected is not contrary to being dominated but what makes the experience sexy and eagerly consensual.\n\nSo even if the choking was technically consensual, something may have happened here to remind her that she's not actually into being treated as OP treated her.",

If you want to save this relationship take my advice to heart and talk to her about it. Or this is a joke and I'm being even more absurd for being real at you. Who knows?",

Just say that you spent a long time reflecting on it and wanted to communicate everything as best you can, so you wrote it down in a letter so it would be perfect! Then give her the letter and when she (hopefully) forgives you, just act normal (but a little extra nice) for the next few weeks. You're going to have to build up her comfortability with you again. Hugs, kisses, touching, then sexy time. I wouldn't use sexy time too soon, let her initiate (or if the mood is right).",
