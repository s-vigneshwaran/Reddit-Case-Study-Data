Also, the science says that embryos don't even develop a gender until at least 2 week in utero, if I recall. Miscarriages happen spontaneously pretty frequently up until 12 weeks, which is also before an embryo/fetus can \"feel\" any pain if I recall. Let's not discuss \"life\" in this way, especially in light of recent supreme court rulings which very much go against the science.\n\nYou are the one who said \"buying.\" It's a very poor metaphor. If women are disappointed in how their rushed encounters turned out, it's blatantly obvious that they didn't think they were taking a risk for nothing. It is a fairly reasonable assumption to make that the main thing these women were missing was probably only TIME. Other promises may have been made obviously, if you want to consider that \"payment.\" If you don't think sex is essentially paid for, then could you clarify what you really mean here?\n\nI do think sex is a risk- man or woman. This is exactly why I have the more equal view that a man logically should be happy to wait a reasonable time frame, even if poorer decisions were made in the past. It isn't men who pay and women who sell... Except in case where that literally happens.",

Women also learn from what we see happen to other women, if we are fortunate enough to have the necessary dialogue and guidance. It's quite healthy for people to learn from what doesn't work for us.\n\nAnd you'll never catch me saying that men must date or sleep with anyone. They really, really don't have to. I just don't want to hear complaints. They make their decisions, they live with them, and they're not so perfect themselves. If I was left out of it and my nieces didn't have to read about negative stereotypes or falsehoods on the internet, I'd be happy.\n\nI'm well aware I don't agree with people in this sub, and they won't agree with me.

There you will find hundreds of threads all over Reddit, including [this one posted just 16 hours ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fourthwavewomen/comments/vn12r4/because_modern_liberal_choice_feminism_is_still/), shitting all over the idea of \"choice Feminism\" or Feminism designed to simply give women more choices. The entire r/fourthwavewomen subreddit is practically overflowing with these kinds of discussions.\n\nAccording to the Radfems who write and engage in these threads, women in our culture do not have free choice. They have internalized misogyny and have been brainwashed by the Patriarchy, therefore they do not have the agency to make proper choices for their lives, especially as it relates to sex work.\n\nThey view liberal/choice Feminists like you as the enemy, promoting a narrative about Feminism that is not only wrong, but dangerous to women.\n\nYou seem like a nice person and I appreciate your contribution to this discussion, but you seem to have a very narrow and rosy-eyed view of what Feminism actually is.",

They think of the porn industry as a objectifying industry which takes advantage of women and turns them into sex objects, same with prostitution and any kind of sex work. They see trans rights as another way that men and the patriarchy are imposing their will on women and invading their spaces.\n\nThere are tons of radical feminist subreddits all over this site, and it's the fastest growing form of Feminism in the world. They see the harm mainstream Feminism has done to women and they're horrified by it.\n\nOf course, Radical Feminism has problems of its own. It still blames men for everything, it's still based on lies and distorted statistics. But worst of all, in order to help women it must first claim that women's choices are a product of brainwashing and cultural indoctrination which keeps them subservient to men.\n\nPoint is, Feminism isn't a monolith, but it certainly is not just about allowing women to choose.",

Sexual repression until marriage spells out I S S U E S to me bro. Does she want the man she marries to be a virgin? Or would she find that repulsive if he was? Does she want the man she's going to spend the \"rest of her life with\" to have ZERO sexual experience? Do you genuinely think that's a good thing?

T\n\nHow is being a virgin going into a marriage going to produce a long lasting stable relationship? That's wishful thinking if I've ever seen it. Nobody views marriage as a \"oh I can have sex now\" thing, EXCEPT... except.. The people who are virgins going into their marriage. It's the opposite of what you think. Sex isn't that big of a deal in western culture, and if it's such a big deal to some people, why wait until you're married to do it? Wouldn't men try to marry just to lose their V card so they can divorce? Is that not worse? Devalues the value of marriage as a whole? And would leave you questioning every man's intentions who seems like he ACTUALLY WANTS to marry you because he \"loves\" you.",

How about countries that have mandatory army service for young men? How about how men are forced to focus on their career growing up/as adults aswell, because the main thing women care about is a man's career, how much money he makes e.g. \"How well can he take care of me and our eventual family we make\" talking about \"things that are forced upon a person\" men get everything forced upon them, and then they get blamed for it. Fuck this world. Where are the sugar mommies? Do they exist or is that wishful thinking? Why don't women support men? Why is it men who are expected to support women? Why is everything so broken? Women think men who can't \"take the lead\" (in everything) are weak and not fit to be with etc, so passive/non aggressive men end up alone which is the literal reason so many women are up in arms talking about the nature of masculinity and men etc. Thing is these women wont lift a fucking finger or change a single thing to make a change. You think she wants to live with some guy who's making 70k a year when there's another guy messaging her who makes 140k? No shit she's gonna money branch to the 140k guy and pretend she loves him and they're made for each other etc etc you know how this shit goes. I'm done. Men have no choice, it's either shut out everyone and work on your career for 10/20 years, or you get shit on by women for your entire life, until you fucking die. What's equality?",

Karen Straughan has done a series of masterful video essays on the issues men face and why society is inclined to ignore their needs unless they are rich, famous, or in some way dominant.  As you say, men who are not in some way prominent are dismissed as cannon fodder, red shirts, clone troopers, to be ignored and used without mercy or compassion.  And now, after having alienated men for several generations and blamed them for all of society's ills, women could use some allies; but most progressive men are useless in a fight, and men will fight for their families, they won't fight for themselves.  It's a very good time to be single and to have good friends one can count on.  Not a good time to be in a relationship with an American woman, for the most part.",
