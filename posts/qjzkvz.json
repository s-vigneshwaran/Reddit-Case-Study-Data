  "text": "TIFU by not kissing a girl at a college football game on national television.\n(This happened yesterday)\n\nAlso, throwaway since I don't want IRL friends finding my account\n\nSo there's a video going around of the Wake vs. Duke football game of a girl leaning in to kiss a guy and him not returning the kiss, and looking away. It's on r/therewasanattempt, and currently on r/popular, as well as trending on TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter.\n\nThat guy is me.\n\nI have gotten texts from high school friends I haven't talked to in years, random college classmates, and my sister and mom who have all seen that video, and I'm gonna take this brief moment of internet fame to explain what actually happened.\n\nBasically, I've been talking to this girl for a while and we just started dating about a week ago. I tell her she should come to the Wake game since we are undefeated and will probably win. She says yes. We go with a group of friends, and we are having a great time. Throughout the game we are flirting, hugging, kissing a little bit, etc. We also do this thing where one of us leans in for a kiss, and the other person leans away, which is an inside joke between the two of us. So, we do our little inside joke thing, and unbeknownst to us, we are being recorded.\n\nAfter the game, I find I'm on the wake forest old row Instagram page, and within the hour I'm on the official old row page. Then, I'm on TikTok, Twitter, and apparently Reddit too.\n\nJust to clarify a few things:\n\n1. She did not get rejected, we were just playing around\n2. We did not know we were being recorded\n3. If you want proof, check our TikTok accounts (hhhhggggllll and sandx.lop)\n4. It was also her first (maybe last?) college football game\n\nAnyway, the internet is full of horrible people and I haven't done any work this weekend, so I'm gonna go do that now. Peace\n\nTL;DR I didn't kiss a girl at a football game and now I'm paying the price.\n\nedit: I'm using a throwaway so people don't read my post history, not to hide my identity, for all those asking.",

We're at the point in our relationship where we're comfortable in silence as we are talking.  We chatted for a bit as we ordered our drinks, then my GF hopped on her phone to check socials.  I was just sort of chilling; checking out the cool decor (the lounge is themed sort of like fancy morgue).  \n\n\nThere's this girl behind us who sees her and comes over and is all like \"You shouldn't be on your phone, you're on a date!\"  She thought it was like super early in the relationship, so I had to explain to her.  We all had a good laugh.",

We were at a work Christmas dinner, and the company I was with at that time usually splurged on fancy Christmas outings which us young people couldn't afford. A coworker and me (we were the two youngest people present by a margin) would take pictures of the courses (no one else at the table thought that was in any way out of place, btw). Server comes by and makes a snarky remark that people these days can't do anything without posting it on Instagram. Dude was our age, too. Totally ruined the joy of looking at the pictures. Get fucked, you asshole.",

Instead, the comment they replied to said:\n\n> I honestly think it's better to hear her side of the story which appears to have been completely ignored so far in all of these comments\n\n...which at least to me, the way it's written, seemed to imply as if her side of the story is different from his. So rather than your \"basically\" interpretation, IMO what they basically said is: \"But her side of the story is the same, so how can you say it's being ignored?\"",

My point is that if that comment was \"Here's her video, backing up what he said\" then most likely you wouldn't have seen the reply that annoyed you. \n\n> The expectation that it adds something beyond that is too great and when I read the comment linking her account I had expected her to back him up so there was no expectation explicitly\n\nThe fact that I wasn't the only person who got that impression clearly shows there's at least some room for misunderstanding with the wording they used. It's cool that you got what they meant, but I didn't, and neither did everyone else. I'm not criticizing them for commenting or anything, I'm merely explaining the most likely reasoning behind the comments that annoyed you, and that their intent probably wasn't what annoyed you.",

Context ALWAYS MATTERS, and a four second clip of someone is almost NEVER enough to reliably and accurately assess the relationship between the people who appear in it.\n\nAny online video you see of a relationship, a political opponent, a police officer, an activist, a rude customer or employee, etc., should ALWAYS be taken with a grain of salt. Sometimes you are legitimately catching a bad person in the act. Sometimes you're seeing a normal person having a bad day. Sometimes you're seeing an out of context event that you or the cameraman have misinterpreted. \n\nBe skeptical of clips that are short, don't provide the initial lead-up interaction or other context, or are clipped in strange places. I know everyone reading this already knows it but it's amazing how easy it is to forget once you click away from this story and scroll down to the next out of context video on Reddit. This is an exercise that you should practice with any video or picture you see online, every single time.",
