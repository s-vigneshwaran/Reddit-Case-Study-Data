The very lens through which they see and interpret the world is racist and homophobic, and thus they end up inadvertently supporting things they simultaneously believe they are against. The next problem then is that it is easier for them to make excuses for the bigotry they see (or even eventually embrace it outright) than it is for them to reevaluate their worldview and the inherent harmfulness of it.\n\nSo when it comes to his former Parks and Rec coworkers, they see the silly, goofy, very funny, non-serious and lovable Chris Pratt who never did bigoted things, and they likely believe him now when he says he still isn't a bigot because, well, he never was around them either. But that is because they likely don't see that his worldview is bigoted. They probably haven't even considered his worldview very much at all.\n\nAgain, just me sharing a completely falsifiable take based only on observation.",

I didn\u2019t know that I would kind of become the face of religion when really I\u2019m not a religious person. I think there\u2019s a distinction between being religious \u2013 adhering to the customs created by man, oftentimes appropriating the awe reserved for who I believe is a very real God \u2013 and using it to control people, to take money from people, to abuse children, to steal land, to justify hatred,\u201d Pratt said.\n\nSo it sounds like he\u2019s religious, but against the more organized parts of it. Idk, he is probably on the right but I wouldn\u2019t call him right wing by any means.",

Reclaiming that symbol of persecution as a symbol of defiance is a common trend thought history. Back when Christians were persecuted for their beliefs (some 2022 years ago) it would make sense for Christians to keep themselves hidden. They had various ways of recognizing each other and iconography is always faster than an exchange of word. It's a :error simple shape so it would be very easy to make a sign of the cross or wear one. And to most it wouldn't mean anything back then, but those who knew what it meant could make the connection. It stuck around and has become the \"thing\" that Christians do.",

Those ideologies (even without the threat of violence) are scary and strange to me and I would never support them. But I'm not a native American,and I was never brought up with the idea that freedom is the greatest goal of humanity and all governments can turn tyrannical at the drop of a hat.

I think Pratt is on the progressive side of Christianity, the side that advocates love and acceptance and disavows the hate and bigotry that polluted the church.  Some modern Christians simply believe that a loving God sent a part of themself to Earth as both an example of how to live and as a means for the rest of us to attain a boundlessly blissful afterlife in harmony with everyone else who acted decently.  Many modern Christians march in the same marches you want to be a part of.",
