I spend a lot of my time on trains just traveling to who knows where for whatever reason why, and I've found that most people will just tolerate being stared at. I know I do. I don't mind people staring at me with my mirror-shingled shirt and inviting mustache. Please, by all means. Let me have your eyes. And likewise, I don't much see too many people make a big fuss out of being stared at. I'm missing a bottom eyelid on my right eye, so even if I'm snoozing, I'm still kinda staring at people, but for the most part, yeah, it's a purposeful stare. I like how people look. I like looking at all the different people on the train. I love people. That's what it comes down to. I love people and I love seeing them, love staring at them, love seeing if I could gaze through their eyes and into their brain and experience some recent memory of theirs before is moves to the back of the brain which is much harder to see. And people don't fuss. Like I said, I stare at a lot, a lot, a lot of people all day long on the trains, and nobody makes a big fuss about it. So feel free to stare and stare. You'll find people to be very accommodating if you give them a chance.",
