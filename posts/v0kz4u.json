Keep in mind that the majority of our politicians are of an age where they are decidedly in the \"at-risk\" category for Covid(our politicians are mostly crusty old fucks, average age of congress is like late-60s, including the few young ones) , even now with vaccines.\n\n\\-She has, repeatedly, compared vaccine mandates, masks, and restrictions, to Nazis and The Holocaust.\n\n\\-She \\*supported\\* the dumbasses who stormed the capital on January 6th and has called for their release, denying that it had anything to do with white supremacists, while also calling Black Lives Matter a terrorist organization.\n\n\\-As far as I can tell, she thinks Contraception and Abortion are basically the same thing, and opposes both.\n\n\\-She is anti-electric vehicle for whatever freaking reason.\n\n\\-She STILL believes that the election was \"stolen from Trump\", and has been seen openly wearing clothing with \"Stop The Steal\" written on it; she literally started her political campaign by filing papers to try and impeach Biden like a day after he took office.\n\n\\-She is literally a QAnon conspiracy theory nutjob. I can't even get into that without a whole other posts, but she supports and believes all of their dumb bullshit.\n\n\\-\\*Quick edit\\*: I somehow forgot her thing about \"Jewish space lasers causing forest fires\". \n\nNow, if you want to be really upset like me: **this dumbass makes $174,000 A YEAR as an elected official, WHICH IS COMPLETELY PAID FOR FROM \\*OUR FREAKING TAX DOLLARS\\*!**\n\nI hate it here.",

From reading her wiki she does seem like a QAnon follower who was rich enough and had a smart enough campaign manager to get elected.",

When I (under another account name, I make a new one every 20k karma points) quoted that man and linked to the source, I got stampeded by downvoting COVID denialists and people who said I was being anti-American. And this was somewhere around April 2020.

So now this shit is spreading like wildfire and it\u2019s terrifying to see how many radical morons surround us while claiming patriotism. The GOP convention before the election was filled with people yelling at the camera about freedom and whatnot in a way very similar to how terrorist leaders in 3rd world countries address their constituents. They realized that fear mongering works on a good chunk of the country that suddenly was empowered to reveal their radical thoughts to the world because they see them from their \u201celected officials\u201d and all these other communities they find online so that now one radicalized half wit sees all the other half wits and they think they are a righteous community and they no longer feel crazy for their absolutely insane thoughts.",

It later emerged that he opted to move in with relatives in Indiana after being forced to vacate his house under the terms of a pending divorce. Reportedly, his wife divorced him because of death threats they were receiving. He did not have enough money to pay for a place to live while the divorce was pending, and federal campaign finance law does not allow candidates to use campaign funds for housing. As a result, Van Ausdal was forced to move out of Georgia, which made him ineligible for the seat. \n\nThe death threats destroyed his marriage and forced him to live in another state so their crazy conspiracy theorist won. Things like this are why the US are considered a flawed democracy with a constantly sinking democracy index.",

Russia and China, that\u2019s a longer answer than fits on a Tweet. That goes back to fracking, member fracking. It was pretty good for everybody mostly, except for people who got their bathtubs on fire. But pretty good. Then the pandemic that hit the whole world, except for Trump-humpers cuz they special, and demand dropped cus people weren\u2019t driving a bunch. Okay, look this up because you won\u2019t believe me. One day the price of oil dropped below a dollar a gallon. Not for you or me because the market doesn\u2019t work like you think, but it did. That drove a lot of smaller oil drillers out of business, in large part because Russia tried to make up for their short fall by flooding the market. You won\u2019t believe me so look this up. For a bit in 2020 the price of oil was less than a nothing. And the market did what markets do. Please research how many small oil businesses went out of business because of that. Then demand jumped back to pre-\u201cI won\u2019t get the vaccine Trump funded\u201d levels but supply didn\u2019t follow because they\u2019re making so, so, so many shit loads of money. The president has so very little to do with the price of oil, unless we re-invade Iraq, but OPEC has a whole bunch to say about that. Check FOX, they aren\u2019t loud about it because they\u2019d rather Biden gets the blame, but they\u2019ll still put a finger on OPEC if you dig just a little. If it makes you feel a little more Republican you can take some satisfaction that OPEC is mostly Islamic countries.",

He spent so much time fighting with his own DOJ that it became mostly ineffective. The federal government was utterly useless for anything while he was calling the shots.

Basically there is very little vetting of candidates by the minor parties as they lack funding and rarely do they have a genuine chance of winning seats. It took a constitutional crisis for him to get elected from his spot on the ticket. He immediately left One Nation as he wouldn't follow Hanson's conditions, and sat as an Independent before joining Katter's party, who soon after kicked him out as well. Also Hanson said after his maiden speech that she was \"appalled\" and his speech was \"straight out of Goebbels handbook\". \n\nIn 2019 he ran under his newly formed Fraser Anning's conservative National Party and his group ticket received just 1.28% of the vote in Queensland. His party was soon after deregistered for failing to maintain enough members for party registration, Anning filed for bankruptcy and the AEC brought legal action against him for not filing financial statements, with the case eventually dropped as he can't be located and is believed to be overseas. \n\nThe far right fringes and crazies certainly exist in Australia but they remain firmly on the fringe and have a very hard time getting elected, unlike MTG and people like Boebert etc.",

The primary election is where each political party decides who will represent them in the general election, and then the winner from each party faces each other in the general election to decide the final winner.\n\nIn extremely lopsided districts such as Marjorie Taylor Greene's district, the primary is the important one and the general election is just a formality where the dominant party wins pretty much automatically.  \n\nShe ran unopposed in the general because the Democrats didn't have a chance anyways, she was not unopposed in the Republican primary and faced many other opponents.  She won the Republican nomination handily because her beliefs are mainstream beliefs in the Republican party.

If you listen to her, her tone implies she is being very literal about space lasers. She's not giving any examples of what her metaphor would be either. She is just plainly saying she is worried about jew space lasers. This was when they had a lot of raging fires, and that was her explanation on how those fires happened. There were very literal fires, and that was how she explained them.\nI do believe she is putting it out there as something to be taken very literally. I will accept that she may not believe it herself, but not being crazy but instead taking advantage of crazy people may make more sense for a politician but it sure as hell doesn't make you any better than if you were crazy.",

Old English and Old Norse share the most commonalities of the germanic languages and have the highest chance of being understood by speakers of both languages, so the old English words are based on the Nordic themes. So you literally have only one day with Roman roots, wouldn't call that a mix of Roman and Norse.",

I think some people emulate this through smaller platforms and try to do the same thing. \n\nHer calling it a peach tree dish really seems fake to me. Sort of like when youtube people mispronounce words on purpose to spike viewer engagement. It's weird but it's real thing. I think on some psychological level it's meant to make the viewer feel intellectually superior. \n\nHas anyone else noticed this that can explain it better maybe?",

So I assume that it came from a more emotional place, I hope you don\u2019t find that condescending.\n\nThe person you are talking to, the \u201cconservative\u201d\u2026 they are not claiming to be part of the group you think they are. I know what that feels like as a Christian who\u2019s beliefs couldn\u2019t be further than some people\u2019s associations with the term.\n\nConservatism isn\u2019t a bad thing, it\u2019s a balancing force to progressivism. Restrictive and expansive. When in balance, they create a proper environment for creation and complexity. An example being evolution: mutation (expansive) and selection (restrictive), or Divergent Thinking (expansive) and Convergent Thinking (restrictive), which is probably a better example than evolution actually.\n\nThe base motivation that drives someone to be conservative isn\u2019t inherently bad. However, the current \u201c\u201d\u201dconservative\u201d\u201d\u201d party is NOT in balance with the progressives, at all. They\u2019ve warped and distorted the perspective of their supporters, the people who have the \u201cwholesome\u201d conservative drive, tricking them into believing that the scales are far too tipped towards progressivism, when in reality the scales couldn\u2019t be more tipped to the conservatives. (Except that\u2019s just a phrase and they can totally be tipped further and that\u2019s what\u2019s fucking scary)\n\nIf I could reference one of your earlier discussions, it\u2019s similar to the \u201cloud fake trans people\u201d thing. There ARE no fake trans people, and if there are, they are entirely irrelevant to our legislation on trans healthcare. However the current right wing intentionally distorts and magnifies this fake issue, to get the people to try and \u201cbalance it out\u201d by voting for them, which just pushes us even further to the right. (Side note, I\u2019ve always been confused as to why the terms left and right aren\u2019t swapped. Maybe it\u2019s because they originally weren\u2019t linked to progressivism and conservatism. Oh well.)\n\nAnyway my point being, which\u2026 didn\u2019t really need all that wall of text, it\u2019s just to not jump to conclusions/assumptions simply based on one interpretation of a word. That kind of thing is what widens the divide between people and closes people\u2019s minds off to actual discussion. I\u2019m pretty sure the person you replied to has kept their cool, but sometimes comments like these can do more harm than good and prevent us from really understanding each other.\n\n(Final note, again I want to make clear that I don\u2019t mean for this to sound condescending. I\u2019m autistic and oftentimes my comments aren\u2019t received they way I mean them to, so I\u2019m trying to learn how to better phrase my thoughts.)",

Make the gop Whigs v2 and split the dems up between \"\"\"conservative\"\"\" dems and people like bernie. \n\nTHEN we can talk about conservatives not being a cancer to democracy because you know, as shitty and controlled opposition as the dems are at least they support voting rights so we can vote them out. Even tho I still think conservative dems are just as ineffectual and thus nearly as negative a force as \"conservatism\".\n\nPlus, if we're being honest I don't even buy the need for that pussyfooting trepidation around progress. \n\n**Especially** with some issues as late stage as wealth inequality or climate change. We lost the chance to not be aggressive (read ambitious and progressive) when addressing those serious issues by ignoring them for decades. \n\nThere will never be a shortage of people not wanting to make progress, I just can not understand how if you have half a brain or education like you clearly do, one can look at history and say progress is a bad thing and we should slow things down. It's crazy. that's been the excuse to not make progress since time immemorial. \n\nLiterally \"Meh, keep people suffering, they used to suffer too. Tradishun. wouldn't wanna try anything too bold that might actually help anyone!!!\" \n\n\"Why stop having slaves we've been doing it for so long why stop making kids work we've been doing it forever why establish a minimum wage and osha shit is finnnne the way it is. Literally no helpful train of thought in ACTUAL conservatism. \n\nThe conservatives you imagine as a counter balance to TOO MUCH progress are as much a fairy tale as heaven and a magic sky arbiter. Never in the history of man kind have we made too much fucking progress to necessitate an anchor around our ankles lol. Literally never helpful. I don't get where this weird fabled imagine of conservatism comes from. \n\nLook at actual history and reality and what conservatives DO. try to preserve slavery, abortion bans, climate destruction, oppression of minorities wether that be thru dont say gay bills or Nixon's war on drugs to \"persecute the anti war left and blacks\" \n\n>An example being evolution: mutation (expansive) and selection (restrictive), or Divergent Thinking (expansive) and Convergent Thinking (restrictive), which is probably a better example than evolution actually.\n\nIn short I don't buy all this shit about conservatism being helpful. You know what's helpful? Empirics and experts. \n\nConservatism is anathema to empirical evidence. It's more like \"me like tradishunnnn, keep doing that\" than it is \"lets maybe achieve the goal a different more conservative way\". That second image is a dream that does not exist in the us. Probably anywhere. \n\nAgain idgaf about what voters THINK their reasons for voting gop might be, i gaf what gop politicians are ACTUALLY DOING. If you vote for them idgaf what your reasons are, you are supporting treason and an authoritarian attack on democracy.\n\nIt is actually incredible someone can look at how the gop operate obstruction, blind voting against every bill, not even bringing bills to the floor to vote and think that because of that abstract bullshit \"we're ACTUALLY just a nice counterbalance\" they're NOT a malignant tumor. \n\nMother fucker we don't NEED OR WANT A COUNTERBALANCE to shit like \"Democracy is good, let people vote\" \"Climate is a serious issue we need to address or hundreds of millions will die of heat, water and food shortages in the coming decades\" \"let gay people get married\" \n\nWTF??? What on earth makes you imagine a counter balance is needed for those prerogatives. Un fucking believable\n\nIt is BRAZENLY DISHONEST to act like the gop is any sort if positive force. You are actually being glib. They are not whatever you imagine rational conservatism is in fantasy land. Look at what they ACTUALLY DO. Not what they tweet about some abstract values \n\nDon't vote gop? Call yourself whatever the fuck you want , conservative progressive idgaf. It's what you do. Don't ever vote for those anti democracy traitors in the gop and idgaf what you call yourself in your impotent non participation\n\nAgain, part of this disagreement feels like you're misinterpreting my scope. my comment is limited to american \"\"\"conservatism\"\"\" aka southern strategy racist sexist climate change denying vaccine denying space lazer peach tree dish lunatic gop'rs. \n\n>not jump to conclusions/assumptions simply based on one interpretation of a word. That kind of thing is what widens the divide between people and closes people\u2019s minds off to actual discussion\n\nReally feel like this is terminal late stage stockholm syndrome. How the fuck do the lot sayin fuck that democracy thing, fuck that women autonomy thing, fuck that climate change thing deserve ANYTHING??? They should be fucking ignored, put away from the rest of the adults actually looking to do soemthing other than say \"no, keep shit the same\"  wtf? \n\nParadox of tolerance, some shit if left unchecked, is so cancerous it will destroy every good thing that allowed it to exist in the first place. Anti democracy rhetoric like the big lie the gop are pushing is a clear clear clear example of them trying to use the tolerance of their lunacy to destroy democracy. \n\nLike I still don't think people like you get how serious Jan 6th was. It was a coup attempt man. We are on the fucking edge. It can happen here. \n\nThe anti abortion anti climate change anti vax anti trans dont say gay lunatic fucks ARE THE FUCKIN CONSERVATIVES MAN. \n\nEven IF they don't believe that shit it's not a fucking deal breaker and they still vote for/with those that DO believe it. \n\nSoo idgaf what they convince themselves is the REAL reason they vote to fuck over the planet, gay, trans poor immunocompromised etc etc. All I care about is what their actions are. If you vote GOP you are evil for supporting the litany of sick disgusting evil policy they support. \n\nThere aren't some hidden class of educated REAL conservative voters man. There's just those stupid uneducated hateful racist regressive evangelical hogs who like you note, got tricked by the modern array of Goebbels's into believing trans people and late stage abortions are the real issue not impending climate collapse or poverty or inequality. Like you even note it.\n\n>They\u2019ve warped and distorted the perspective of their supporters, the people who have the \u201cwholesome\u201d conservative drive, tricking them into believing that the scales are far too tipped towards progressivism, when in reality the scales couldn\u2019t be more tipped to the conservatives.\n\nYou recognize they lie and misrepresent reality to fool their stupid racist sexist hog jeebus fetish voters, yet somehow you're stockholmed into thinking they're anything but a cancer to the world. I don't understand. \n\n16/17 most educated states voted one way, 15/17 least educated voted the other. They simply don't have the faculties to deduce reality from the world they see around them. And conservatism NEEDS to be refuted as a real belief system as often as possible",

I don't think I said anything about what I considered myself other than being a Christian, which I feel like you might have assumed meant I supported the \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"Christian\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" party. (There couldn't be enough quotation marks on that)\n\nThat's what I meant by misunderstanding a word, when I or the other commenter said conservative, it had nothing to do with politicians. And like I already said I'm aware that there is NO need for a \"counterbalance\" in America today, because things are ALREADY so restrictive and suppressed.\n\nThe Paradox of Tolerance like you mentioned, is an example of \"conservatism\" (meaning, restrictive counterbalance) can be necessary.\n\nBut anyway, the main thing I'm trying to say is that they don't just fool the racist bigots. They fool well meaning people too. That's what all the warping is for - things that normally no one would support get hidden behind lies and \"causes\" that were never there. It's the reason why pedophilia always gets pushed as a main antagonist, because if it weren't there, there wouldn't be enough people who'd be fine with being anti gay etc. Instead, now it's just a sacrifice they \"have to make\" to protect the children. Otherwise there'd be no way to justify it and it probably WOULD be a dealbreaker. All those things are impossible for someone to accept without being either entirely sociopathic, or blinded in some way. Both by the politicians, or by themselves.\n\nBut accusing them of things doesn't help to get through to them and can push them deeper into that darkness is what I was saying. As opposed to seeing what they *actually* intend, and helping them realize that their actions and the results of those actions don't line up with that at all.\n\nAnd as you mentioned January 6th, no I don't believe any of the people there were \"good hearted conservatives\". No level of twisting will get you to do that if you didn't already desire it on some level.",

Like I get what you're trying to say, \"beliefs inform political choices, they are separate, propaganda takes well meaning caution and corrupts it\" but the only part of that abstract belief system that matters is the part that influences others, ergo how you vote. The rest doesn't matter in the slightest to the utilitarian. The voting is what affects others, not whatever the fuck you call yourself ideologically on facebook. \n\nI don't care about the why the idiots bought what the gop are selling, I only care about how to reduce their prescence, their impact, their existence.\n\nAnd part of doing that is putting up strict resistance to any tolerance of them, thus the animosity. \n\n>I\u2019m aware that there is NO need for a \u201ccounterbalance\u201d in America today, because things are ALREADY so restrictive and suppressed\n\nSo you agree with me the gop that exist under the safer rhetorical umbrella of \"conservatism\" need be made a thing of the past? \n\nHow do you intend to do that when your rhetorical strategy is \"meh be nice to em keep letting em corrupt empty headed uneducated fucks\" ???? You missed the point of the paradox of tolerance point. This is NOT A GROUP we can be tolerant of man. How do you not see that after jan sixth????? \n\nI just don't buy the \"be kind to the nazis so they come back to the side of reason\" as a compelling argument. If you voted for 2x impeached traitor a second time your brain is broken you are too far gone. Fool me once. \n\nYou're basically arguing for the appeasement of authoritarian fascists. You need to read some history man. Appeasement of fascists doesn't fucking work. \n\nI'd argue you're taking tolerance of authoritarians way way too far with any acceptance of gop voters. They supported a coup man, overturning a democratic election. \n\nThis is NOT a fucking group you talk calmly and kindly to.\n\n\nYou recognize they call all lgbt pedos to dehumanize in preparation for genocide (if you think that's dramatic you're not aware of what rhetoric historically prefaces genocides) but you're convinced that people who buy what these nazi great replacement fucks are selling are just kind hearted idiots??\n\nI disagree. I think we have more sick evil minority hating fucks than you are willing to believe so you're coping hard for fear of the consequences of that reality. Transphobia alone is so common place I find it really odd your naive belief of good in the souls of american voters. Since reconstruction we have ceded far too much ground to pieces of shit for want of \"civility\" with a group who have no aim to be tolerant themselves.",

If you truly believe in what you say, then go make the change in the world. \n\nTheir are plenty of republicans who hate the current party. I believe that their should of been blood on the steps before any of those terrorists stepped foot in the capital. \n\nAgain, Im not against abortion. Personally, i think its morally wrong. I have never been in that decision, nor can i put myself in the mind of one making the decision. Therefor, who am i to say its okay or not okay. I have my own opinion, but that doesn\u2019t mean i think it should be the law. I think anyone in the position should do it as soon as possible, and if its for a medical reason, no questions asked. I do think there is an issue tho if someone were to have them over and over again, because why is that happening? But shit happens and i get that. \n\nAs far as felons voting, they gave up that freedom when they became a felon. They paid their debt like you said, and thats why they are given back their \u201cfreedom\u201d.\n\nI never said i liked the current republican party, or that i identify as a republican. I said I\u2019m a conservative. Fiscally i am, but socially, as long as it isn\u2019t hurting someone, then its fine by me. I wont say what someone can and can\u2019t do, if it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone else, because who am i to point out the sliver in ones eye when i have a log in my own. \n\nAll I\u2019m saying is don\u2019t be so hateful and show so much disdain for people you prematurely label as a \u201ctraitor\u201d. I view this as the single greatest issue in politics currently and i hate it. Republicans do it. Democratics do it. Everyone does it and i hate it to the point that I despise politics. Just be nice and civil for Christ sake.",

He used to complain about colleges making kids socialist beatniks too, and a grip of that was because of Vietnam. Kids in college would not be drafted, so college is bad. Once they realized that people going to college trend to the liberal and away from the capitalist ideals, limiting the appeal of university became a standard GOP talking point. \n\nAlthough there are thousands of republicans that went to higher education, they really lean into the ones that didn\u2019t (Boebart), and make fun of democrats that did. AOC is a prime example. \n\nThey want the elite only to go to college so that the masses stay dumb and don\u2019t rise up. To be fair, Nixon didn\u2019t think of it, it\u2019s pretty much been the standard operation for all of history.",

A former friend of mine that I'd guess to be of higher than average intelligence, believes wholeheartedly in several conspiracies and has spent so much of his time posting videos of trees burning *from the inside*! His reasoning: \"everyone knows that trees only burn from the outside, so explain THIS!\". Space lasers became the more rational explanation for him because he heard it from multiple sources that weren't \"colluding with MSM\". \n\nWhen I provided my own perspective of how logs at campfires absolutely can burn from the inside out with only the bark remaining towards the end, he asserted that the Liberal Institution had eaten my brain and if I refused to see The Truth^^^TM, then I'd become the enemy. I eventually felt pressured to cut off all contact and blocked him by phone, email and social media.\n\nMy point is that something other than intellect is helping people accept all these false narratives created to sow discord. Furthermore, I suspect the low-intelligence theory is doing more harm than good. Nobody likes hearing that others think they're stupid and will push back even harder in the face of this argument. My guess is that a deficiency in mental, physical and/or emotional health are the usual causes of a person being indoctrinated.",

It's far more humane (though, while they eventually would like to solve it, it does currently require slaughter but hundreds of times less animals slaughtered per equivalent output).  It can be fortified with vitamins, perfected mixes of fats and other things for taste, texture, etc...\n\nIt's been proven to work and, as it reaches scale, it will likely become less expensive per pound.  There is a lot still to be solved, and it's mainly just producing something fit for ground products like burgers to start, but the benefits are HUGE.\n\n...Unless, of course, you're a fearmongering backwards person who doesn't trust science.

Babble cancer is a problem in my country (apparently due to our meat and alcohol consumption), and our healthcare system would work better if it could predict more shit like that.  \n\nIf the hospital knew every time I pooped and maybe sensors in the toilet that measure stuff and a heart rate monitor built into the seat? Ooh- if my bed took my blood pressure each night while I slept then sent that to my doctor's file?  \n\nFuck yeah!  \n\nSign me up!  \n\nAll I get is free hospitals. I want them to have all my health information all the time.  \n\n**Imagine your doctor phones you up: **.  \n\n>Sir, we've received an alert on your account. As a result of your irregular babble movements and your excessive cheeseburger consumption, your magic Bill Gates microchip started taking more frequent blood samples and we're concerned you might have early onset babble cancer. Please confirm if you'd like one our government drones to perform a colonoscopy in your own home, or would you like to come in and do things the old fashioned way? We could have a drone to you by Thursday.  \n\nAlso, congratulations, your file says you're doing more exercise and are keeping your prostate healthy. Good job.\".  \n\nActually... You wouldn't even get a call from a doctor, your microchip could just send that info to your cellphone and you'd be one click away from an appointment or whatever.   \n\nAutomatic healthcare checkups 24hours a day? FUCK YES! That sounds like something you only see in Star Trek.",

There are [more than 70 roads named Peachtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peachtree_Street#Nomenclature) in the Atlanta region alone! \n\nGeorgia loves its peach iconography \u2014 you may have seen [this](https://www.paramounttax.com/georgia-film-tax-credits.html) at the end of tv episodes and movies shot in Georgia. \n\nAn additional reason is she's dumb.",

It could literally fix the worlds issue of greenhouse gases assuring a future date where production of meat would be too harmful to maintain the livable conditions of our atmosphere, this could be the largest breakthrough in preventing global warming in history.

She's going on a rant about how Bill Gates wants microchips inside people to force them to eat his lab-grown meat.  You completely ignored that insanity to give a tangent on how awesome lab-grown meat is and you're wondering why a statement that has no relevance in a conversation that ignores the complete insanity of the topic isn't getting positive attention.\n\nIt's like you walked by a ten car pile up and started going on a tangent about how EV's are the future of the car industry because they are better for the environment and you don't understand why the people on the scene didn't start a round of applause for you.\n\nThe only thing absurd here is your lack of self awareness, and it for some reason took you two replies to my comment to still not get it.",

You're the on who started complaining about it and claiming the issue is with other people.  You're also the person who chose to make three replies to a single comment that mentioned that you made two replies on the previous.  You're trying to play aloof but an aloof person doesn't behave like that.\n\nI'm not saying there are any rules against posting what you posted, but you posted on a public forum that allows anyone to reply.  If you want to express your opinion you have to everyone else has the right to do the same thing.  I was just pointing out why you got the reaction you did as I wasn't aware if you were generally confused or just doubling down, and my guess I'll get more than three replies to this comment showing that.",

You know, people who talk like this to purposely make facts look like ridiculous tinfoil hat \"conspiracies\".\n\nThey purposely talk like this to make people think this is a lie.\n\nThe reality is that Gates in fact funds all fake meat products and yes, he indeed manipulates markets and monopolizes it to have more people consume his fake meat and food grown in the farms and labs that he owns, to maximize his profits.\n\nHe does own majority of farmland, not just in the US, but also abroad and he wants everyone to consume his products more than meat.\n\nNot to mention he funds WHO, the second largest funder of WHO is him, after US and China.\n\nThe same WHO that claims meat is \"bad\". He also funds many environmental agencies that claim the same.\n\nYou can never trust someone with vested interests. When money is involved, it's a conflict of interest. His reach is deep. Whether you wanna admit it or not, he's not trustworthy in his claims that directly benefit him.\n\nDon't even get me started on how he conveniently \"predicts\" pandemics, while having invested in the \"cures\" for those very diseases.\n\nIf you don't wanna see the connections, fine.\n\nBut the point remains, this is more than just a coincidence.\n\nHowever, people like her in this video, make these facts look and sound ridiculous, by doing stuff like this \"peach tree dish\".\n\nYeah, they're most definitely either 'planted' or are just dumb individuals who have half information and haven't done their research beyond watching a 30 second video on tik tok from an actual conspiracy nut rather than someone who's informed on the subject.\n\nAnd the fact that she's supposed to be a part of the government, makes this worse and makes me think more that she's purposely doing this.\n\nRemember, if you phrase facts in an ignorant way, they seem like a joke, and if you phrase lies in an intelligent way, they seem like facts.\n\nI hope people do their own research outside of reddit and most other social media and stop listening to these kinds of individuals whose only job is to confuse and mislead people.",

He went into this business and recently he started promoting plant based alternatives to meat.\n\nOne product is something I actually enjoy. For a long time instead of typical burgers I order one that use \"Beyond meat\". It taste and feels basically like normal meat without any drawbacks.\n\nBtw beyond meat require skillful preparation and should be fresh. This is why when I tried McDonald burger that also used beyond meat - it tasted like shit. But McDonald burgers generally taste bad. I don't know why people buy them.\n\nThere is similar company called impossible foods. Check them out.\n\nHere is the video of Gates and Mark Rober about this thing:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/-k-V3ESHcfA\n\nSo yes - gates have a business in promoting \"fake burgers\" and I have to say that when done right they are really good.",

Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit. And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.

I don't know what you mean by \"demographic shift\" as I've been discussing it personally in the context of recent loss of life (more than COVID) that has caused extreme changes to healthcare and job market strategies, not \"declining white populations\".\n\nWhat you are probably getting to are the claims of \"underlying narrative\" when it comes to legitimate conversations and those who feel offended that they are in an ancillary inclusion scenario (they're complaining about specific white people, so I must be seen as being part of that group). Sorry that the conversations are hard for you to be involved in and critically process. Your fearmongering is strong, but misinformed.\n\nYour reaction is sad.

If you're not anti-fascist, then you're pro-fascist and Nazi.  Screamed accusations of NAZI! NAZI! NAZI! and the like follow when whoever is being screamed at resists.\n\n2) Cooler heads accurately point out that ANTIFA behaves just like fascist shock troops (aka brownshirts) of pre and during WW2.\n\n3)  A cognitive dissonance with the pro-ANTIFA develops, prompting then to screech more and louder, fling more baseless accusations, and get into a lot of wharrgarbl.\n\nYou have done step 1.
