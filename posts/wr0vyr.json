You can want one or the other or want to have both but that doesn't change the odds of what gender the baby will be. \n\nThere are men who wanted a son and only had daughters whereas there are women who wanted a daughter and only had sons. Yet at the end of the day those men and women still raised their children regardless. I'm just so confused though with this woman. If she hates male genitals so much, how did she even do the deed to conceive this son? Did she do it with her eyes shut and then opened them back up when it was over? \n\nThis whole scenario is very confusing to me.",
