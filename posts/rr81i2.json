Within two hrs when they called me to tell me they where back in Texas right wing and christian radio as well as facebook had convinced them it was antifa that had been behind it. I lost it on them over the phone and had to apologize. We agreed to never discuss politics again.

There's a bunch of them in there conspiracy theorizing about the other removed comments, claiming it was likely due to brigading. Yet there is very little brigading whatsoever in the entire thread. \n\nJust comments from conservatives actually being critical of Putin. I wonder if that was the reason for the mass deleting?",

These people are scared animals backed into a corner by facts about reality that they can't just pray away. Coronavirus is infecting and killing their family members no matter how much they kick and scream and say \"Nuh-uh!\" The racist conservative psychos they vote for are utterly robbing them of their remaining wealth and destroying their infrastructure so they remain stupid and religious: perfect marks for every scam.\n\n It sucks to be a selfish asshole in denial about literally everything and to have your intellectual inadequacy and grotesque lack of empathy on display for all to see. I'd feel bad for them if the type of propaganda that excites them wasn't exclusively targeted at selfish, willfully ignorant assholes. But good people aren't interested in the racist dogwhistles and religionist assertions that conservatives are exclusively preoccupied with. It's hard to feel bad for a club that only lets you in if you're a bad person.\n\nIt's obvious why they carry so much anger and bitterness. It's either that or learn to be good people.",

Basically he said something like, \"If I took the middle road, there's no news there. By being bigger than life, people pay attention to me.\" \n\nHe certainly lost track of that over the decades of growing power and influence and pills. \n\n(BTW, I obviously got over my stint with courting Objectivism and Libertarian ideas.

It happened with Trump - no one thought he would win because it was only rural, uneducated extremists voting for him.

Also please inform me of how it's just as methy when it has the most drug deaths per capita compared to any other Georgia district.

It\u2019s much more stratified wealth, especially with the massive influx of hispanic immigrants in the late 90s due to the demand for cheap labor in the carpet industry.\n\nDalton had the highest per capita millionaires of any city in the US ~1970-1980s. I\u2019ve worked with the kids and grandkids of these folks, it\u2019s lots of dumb and lots of money. Plenty of resources to keep things the way they are and delay failure. Small businesses that would be bled dry in a few weeks in Atl or Chatt can last decades in Dalton.\n\nThere is a small core of liberal folks in Dalton, but don\u2019t confuse these with the scores of liberal-*leaning* college educated young families in the metro Atlanta suburbs. There is some overlap, but the groups shifting Cobb or Dekalb purple is quite different than Whitfield or Walker shifting blue.\n\nNo, they aren\u2019t true backwater through and through, more like a rich, conservative population, a poor conservative population being goaded by the rich and convinced liberals are the enemy, and then the small group of liberals who have to play nice because they probably do business with the wealthy conservatives.

They\u2019re teaching that in the same books where we are supposed to celebrate those pussies in white tights destroying millions of dollars in British property and screaming \u201cgive me liberty or give me death\u201d over fucking taxation without representation???? \n\n\nAnd black people cant say \u201cgive me liberty or give me death\u201d when they\u2019re actively being hunted down and lynched? Lmao literally if the black panther party had gone down to the White House and slaughtered Nixon and burned down the White House in 1972 I woulda called them American heroes doing what needed to be done for the liberty and justice of ALL. In my eyes, it was justified and I can\u2019t think of any other group of people who are expected to be legally lynched without any type of a response. What a joke. \n\nAnyway, merry kwanza bitch.",
