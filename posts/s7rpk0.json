  "text": "TIFU by telling my wife a fake fact to mess with her...\nThis happened almost 15 years ago, and came back to bite me today, which is why it's a TIFU:\n\nMy wife loves Christmas songs, and she looooves to sing them. 15 Years ago, we were on a holiday car ride and she decided to pass the time by singing \"The Christmas Song\" over, and over again, and me being me decided to fuck with her just to be funny.\n\nWhen she got to \"Jack Frost nipping at your nose\", I blanched and asked her why she was singing THAT song, in an absolutely mortified voice.\n\nWhen she looked confused, I feigned surprise that she was unaware of her faux pas and proceeded to  inform her that like many a Grimm's Fairy Tale, Christmas songs often have a dark past and that \"Jack Frost\" was the name of a mental patient from the 20's who broke out of an Asylum during a Christmas break and went around devouring faces, particularly noses, to which he had acquired a taste for.\n\nShe bought it hook, line, and sinker. She was shocked, horrified that people would sing about it, and we talked about it for the duration of the ride, Jack Frost's antics growing darker and darker as the miles flew by.\n\nFast-forward to this morning: I'm in a good mood, it's super snowy, and I have snow-blow the driveway. As I'm getting dressed, I start singing \"The Christmas song\" and she chastises me in a teasing voice.\n\nI had NO idea what she was talking about. She then confides that Jack Frost, the serial nose biter had forever ruined that song for her, and she can no longer stand it.\n\nI laugh and explain that I was teasing that day, and I honestly didn't think she believed me.\n\nShe got mad. MAD mad.\n\nApparently, this has been her go-to-fact during the holidays, and for the last 15 years has shared this dark and gruesome tidbit with anyone who would listen. I guess a sea of confused and disbelieving looks and a flashback of people staring at her as if SHE were a nose biter came back to haunt her as the lie she had been spreading for years came back in a moment of dawning comprehension.\n\nShe's mad and a little hurt, and I am apparently the King of Lies who is never to be trusted again.\n\n\nTL;DR - I told my wife that a Christmas song was about a serial face eater, and she spread that gospel like it was handed down on a stone tablet.\n\n*edited a word that spellcheck didn't like - ALSO, thank you for all the awards, well wishes, and what not. She's forgiven me, feels stupid, and now...I have to explain to her what Reddit is, and how this is my top submission, so I'm not out of the doghouse yet.*\n\n*Next Morning EDIT:  All is well. She loves me, should have expected this from me as I have a tendency to lean towards mischief, and even laughed about Reddit AND Newsweek. All is good, there will be no divorce, I'm sorry that I'm basically Satan from the small group of you requesting that I kill myself for a good-natured teasing, and those of you who claim that you'd never marry me because I'm a manipulative asshole, you've never seen me dance. You would. You SO would.*",

On top of that, it creates a lax attitude among the people supposed to be taking safety seriously, and then the dumb shits who can't tell the difference between humor and taking shit too far actually make mistakes. Then send an aircraft flying. I've seen planes crash. I've known the aircrew in them. I've worked with and for the people working on them. Commercial airlines are a little different because they're way more accountable to the public, but that's hardly the only traffic in the air, and flying, especially outside the commercial aircraft world, is fucking dangerous. I don't think it's funny to fuck with pilots or anyone making them think they're gonna die just because of some pilot vs mechanic rivalry, especially when pilots do fucking die, and sometimes because of loose screws.",

Just plain regular milk bread. My wife was after my life to tell my mom to make the sweet before we reached my city. I told her there is no bread in my city due to local government regulations, and that bread is banned in my city now. I actually convinced her. She went on a rant about how she hates politicians etc etc.\n\nSo when we were driving around my city, she saw a bakery and what do you know? There is a lot of bread on display. And my wife out of sheer excitement, practically jumped off the bike and starting squeeling like an infant : \"BABE,BABE, LOOK. THEYVE GOT BREAD! THEYVE GOT BREAD!!!\" We got a few 'this woman cray cray looks from some of the pedestrians'\n\nI told her to quieten down and told her the truth. She was really mad at me. She laughs about it though.\n\nWhy do we do this, fellow men?",

That\u2019s not them being \u201cover\u201d that\u2019s you both being out of sync on what is important to the other person and not understanding what is driving their strong emotions on that issue. Maybe that is some \u201ccrazy\u201d (mental health) or something you (or even they) don\u2019t understand about why this situation is causing them to react that way. The main point is that *saying* they are overreacting or crazy just shuts down communication, insults them, and is frankly a passive aggressive way to deliberately make someone become *even more* emotional, angry and out of control. Never say that to someone unless you are *deliberately aiming* to inflame the situation.\n\nAn appropriate response will be highly dependent on their actual behavior, including setting appropriate boundaries if \u201ccrazy\u201d involves inappropriate treatment (screaming, abuse, etc), but you should try something closer to: \u201cwow, listen, I\u2019m really sorry, but I had no idea this was such an important issue for you\u201d. This happens to be unequivocally true since you think it\u2019s an \u201coverreaction\u201d but instead of dismissing their feelings it is validating that you are receiving their communication and open to correcting your misconception if they can help you understand. \n\nHell, say that. \u201cI\u2019d really like to understand where you are coming from, and I definitely hear what you are saying, that this matters and needs to be addressed. I hate seeing you hurting like this. I love you and I know we both want the same thing, so we can figure this out.\u201d This alone can calm someone down. Now you are on the same side, trying to communicate, not fighting a battle where their issue (no matter how trivial) is being dismissed and insulted.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t calm the situation down, you can go further. \u201cListen, I also need to say that at the moment the tone of this conversation is kind of overwhelming me and putting me into \u201cautomatic defense\u201d mode even though I\u2019m trying really hard to shut that habit down. Talking about these things so openly isn\u2019t something I\u2019m used to and is really raw and emotionally draining. Maybe we can take a break, make some dinner, let me think about what you\u2019ve said, and then we can come back and talk about to this after we eat?\u201d\n\nSee? All ways of calming down the situation, but like with writing, you should \u201cshow and not tell\u201d. Help calm the situation down and deescalate the conflict with an eye towards eventually coming back and resolving the issue. Even if the issue is truly an overreaction they admit to and the future conversation revolves around \u201cwhen we get emotionally wound up like that and then it turns out to be about nothing, it hurts me. I know you aren\u2019t trying to, but it\u2019s important that we talk about it because it\u2019s burning me out being emotionally on high alert and trying to navigate the knifes edge when we have fights like last night. What can we do to fix this problem? Because it does need to be fixed for us to work together and be compatible.\u201d",

What made the case so well known is that investigators started using some modern forensic techniques that were widely reported at the time. It was the first time detectives and forensics experts had to painstakingly reconstruct destroyed bodies to determine true cause of death. There were widespread complaints that reporting of the case over radio, a novel popular technology at the time, was being overheard by children and keeping them up at fear of being eaten and burned.\n\n> Yuletide carols being sung by a choir / And folks dressed up like Eskimos\n\nThis is in reference to the police's use of carol singers to try to distract crowds that were gathering too close to the scene and interfering with investigators. One of the reasons for the fires was that they would attract a crowd - Jack craved infamy and attention from his lashing out.\n\n> And every mother's child is gonna spy / To see if reindeer really know how to fly\n\nThis is really not for the faint of heart. \n\nJack's attacks escalated before he was caught to become ever more theatrical and brutal. He would mangle his victims before putting them in costume, sometimes putting cheap \"antlers\" on their head and telling them he'd stop if they'd fly for him (one victim actually survived to talk about it, you can find the interview audio on youtube, but you shouldn't). He'd force them to jump off the building. Kids would reputedly stay up looking out their windows for Jack on the rooftops. \n\n> And so I'm offering this simple phrase / To kids from 1 to 92 / Although it's been said many times, many ways / Merry Christmas to you\n\nJack's last words in the electric chair, in reference to his 92 victims. \n\nTruly the world's most grisly, inappropriate Christmas song. I mean I get that edgy is popular, but its really not right to play this in supermarkets and malls.",

      "text": "Oh man\u2026 I feel your pain. Ok, story time!\n\nYears ago, one of my best friend- we\u2019ll call him Dave, married this lady- we\u2019ll call her Jay. We all loved her. She\u2019s sweet, giving, loves to cook for EVERYONE\u2026 honestly, she\u2019s quite the peach. But she\u2019s also very, VERY, **VERY** gullible. I noticed this about her really fast. \n\nSo anyways- one day, I\u2019m going with her to pick up some stuff from IKEA and we\u2019re coming up to these vineyards. The first plot was on rotation, so it\u2019s nothing more than the old seasons support sticks. So she says \u201cI wonder what those sticks coming out of the ground are.\u201d\u2026.. and I just couldn\u2019t resist:\n\n*Actually, that\u2019s a broomstick farm.*\n\n\u201cWait, seriously?\u201d\n\n*Yup. They\u2019re gmo\u2019d. Can\u2019t remember exactly what they\u2019re called, but ye- they don\u2019t need much water and they grow perfectly. Ye just pull em and then they modify em to screw onto a broom. Plus, no plastic and biodegradable! And in the off year, they rotate in a vineyard.\u201d - And that\u2019s when we pass the end of the rotated field and she sees the vineyards.\n\nShe bought it. I couldn\u2019t believe it, but she did. Later on, when we arrived back at her house, she jumps out of the car, runs to Dave and spills EVERYTHING I told her. While she\u2019s talking about how cool of a fun fact she thinks it is.. I can see Dave stare past her\u2026 look me right in the eye.. and just shake his head in disapproval. \n\nThen there was the time she asked me what a boulder farm was. I told her someone had invented a special type of mineral that grew when ye watered them. \n\n\u201cNO WAY!\u201d\n\nMe with serious face: *Ye way, they use them for landscaping all the time. Remember when we went to so-and-so\u2019s birthday party and they had that beautiful garden with those boulders in certain spots?*\n\n\u201cOh yeah!\u201d\n\n*Yeah, what- ye think they\u2019re goin\u2019 to spend a bunch of effort just to move boulders? No way. These minerals come the size of a pebble. Ye place em where ye want the boulder to grow and ye water them until they\u2019re close to the size ye like.*\n\n\u201cTHAT\u2019S AMAZING! I wonder how expensive they are.\u201d\n\nThis carried on for a few years until one day, Dave told her the truth and how I was just spinnin\u2019 stories on her. \n\nSo one day, Dave, Jay, myself and a bunch of friends are going on a camping trip. We get to the campsite and we all start setting up. This took place in Southern California and among all the trees, some of them were Mediterranean Cork Trees. While I\u2019m setting up my tent, Jay is pressing her fingers into a tree and is talking about how squishy the bark feels.. like a cork. \n\n*Actually, you\u2019re right Jay! Those are Mediterranean cork trees and that\u2019s exactly what corks are made of.*\n\nJay spins her head so fast to look at me. With an angry face she just snaps, \u201c**Oh yeah, just like your fuckin\u2019 boulder farm?!?!?!**\u201d and stomped off. \n\nIn that nanosecond, I saw how my joking came a full 360 and slapped me in the face. I could not. Stop. Laughing.",

One of the girls who lived in my neighborhood asked why I'd stopped.  Coincidentally , I also had this HUGE scratch on my arm from playing with a dog.  On the spot,  I told her this long and increasingly unbelievable story about how I was a hacker and I'd been attacked by the mob guy I'd hacked, then was on house arrest because the police caught me.  Plausible enough because she knew I was into computers,  but completely ridiculous at the same time as we were maybe 11 or 12\n\nFast forward 10-15 years,  I'm in a bar and she comes walking up with another girl who I used to hang out with and begins spouting this story as gospel. I'd completely forgotten.  The look of betrayal on her face when I told her was excruciating. It took an hour before she could finally laugh about it. \ud83e\udd23",

I told them that, though they are herbivores, rabbits will sometimes collect and store body parts they come across in the wild, similar to squirrels stockpiling nuts. I continued on saying the Romans had a practice for disgracing executed criminals in which they would remove the organs and leave them for rabbits to collect and spread out in their respective dens. The egg finding tradition is therefore a metaphor for the resurrection of Jesus as you search for his organs to put back into the basket which represents his body. I went way deeper into the yarn talking about how it's a symbol of devotion and service to Jesus and all that. Eventually, I told them that I made the whole thing up and we had a good laugh. \n\nWhat I didn't realize is that one of the students had gone to the bathroom during the story and didn't hear that it was a joke. She went home to tell her hyper-religious parents about it, and they called the school enraged with me. I then had to give them a call and apologize for the joke. Luckily, they were ultimately pretty cool about it in the end.",

I guess they\u2019d been taken inside for something. But I told her that you shouldn\u2019t expect to see them during the day because they burrow underground and only come out at night. Incredible that something so large could build giant underground burrows by scooping out earth with their tusks. She bought it. I laughed internally and then honestly never thought about it again. We often teased and joked with each other and there was no malice to it\n\nFast forward a couple of years to a dinner party we were at and a couple had come back from safari, having seen elephants. She absolutely earnestly asked if they\u2019d been able to see the giant burrows, and I nearly died. She nearly died as she tried to explain the tusk thing as I tried to change the subject and more people start looking at her like she\u2019s crazy. \n\nShe didn\u2019t find it particularly funny at the time, truth be told, but we find it hysterical now, years later.

I like to joke a lot like this but I always follow it up quickly.\n\nIt doesn't seem like a big deal, but it does affect trust.  Because by not correcting her, from an outside perspective, you were lying to her to amuse yourself at her expense.  She became the butt of a joke that she wasn't in on and her feeling hurt is legit.  She also feels embarrassed because she retold the story many times.\n\nYou owe her all the flowers, a nice dinner, an apology, and a promise to never do that again and show her that you are taking this seriously.  Please don't blow this off and ignore her feelings on this or act like it's not a big deal and she's blowing it out of proportion.\n\nSource: guy with a failed marriage",

In Spanish that movie is called Miguel Especial since they don't have a direct translation for 'magic' in that sense, it's the closest they could get.\" \n\nFast forward to a year go, I hear her on the phone with her best-friend talking about 'Miguel Especial' and I rush into the room crying with laughter. I explain that the whole thing was a joke and that every time I said it in the past, I thought she knew I was joking. She was indeed very mad with me, but also found the hilarity in her falling for it.",

She is a major hypochondriac and whenever she reads about any illnesses or ailments she all of a sudden has them.\n\nWell, one time she was going on about some sort of illness she thought she has and I was getting a little over it and ended up saying there is only one way to be sure if you have it or not, and thats if your feet turn green on the bottoms of them. I guess she spent a lot of time looking at them and checking them and was freaking out because she thought she was starting to see a green tinge on her feet. So she then got her boyfriend to inspect them really well and wasn't satisfied with his answer so she drove to our moms house and then grandparents house trying to figure out if the bottoms of her feet were going green or not. Freaking out the hole time about it. Lasted a few days and then she either realized, moved on, or seen her feet weren't going green and was happy with that. \n\nI haven't heard about it since but I thought it was absolutely hilarious.",

However, he comes back as a killer snowman and takes revenge on the man who finally caught him, Sheriff Sam Tiler (Christopher Allport).\" -Wiki",

My Uncle told me how impressive it was that the toymaker overcame adversity and didn\u2019t let his disorder prevent him from making a name for himself. After years of hard work he was finally able to open up his own Toy Store, but due to his Dyslexia he accidentally spelled it \u201cToys R Us\u201d instead of \u201cToys Are Us\u201d and mistakenly flipped the R. \n\nOf course I was impressed and told many people this tale, as I was really inspired by this man\u2019s story. It wasn\u2019t until I was re-telling it at a family dinner (with my Uncle present) that he was called out for it and I realized it was false.  \n\nMy Uncle is a very talented storyteller, to this day I still remember the vivid details and how they came to life in my head.",

We clowned around all the time so I thought nothing of it. \n\nLater down the line, once he's out of college and working for the local rock music station (97.1 the Eagle in Dallas if you care), he apparently shared this story and got so much shit from people. He called me, quite exasperated, and bawled me out over lying to him about OzzY. Naturally, I had no idea what he was talking about. Then he reminded me of it and since I was always such a big fan of OzzY over the years he took it as true. \n\nNaturally, I took the opportunity to make fun of him further upon hearing his retelling of events. I mean, what are friends for if not to chide us through our low points and make it all worse? He'd have done the same for me (and has, lol).",

I had an aquaintence not talk to me for about a month because of a fib I told to a *different* friend that she happened to also hear. Since I was just fooling around I came clean about the fib after like, an hour or two to the *actual* person I was pranking, but the acquaintance was out of earshot. She didn\u2019t find out the truth for a week or two, and  was fuming at me. Heavy collateral damage.",

It's great when the person bought it and they get that look of utter annoyance when they realized I fooled them.

They were the island's original inhabitants before Celtic people migrated there, and established an uneasy coexistence where they mostly stayed out of each other's way but occasionally intermarried. They began to spread superstitious rumours about the Lepeir, or Lepeir Kin as they came to call them, saying that they were mischievous fairy folk with magic powers. Eventually the tensions between the two races reached a point where the Celts wiped out the Lepeir Kin, and all knowledge of them was lost except for the paranoid superstitions. Over time the name Lepeir Kin got blurred into leprechaun and people just assumed they were fictional, because of the magical nature of what they supposedly were, but any Irish person who is uncommonly short may actually be descended from the original leprechauns. The look he gave me when I told him I made it all up was precious.",

After I said that I walk outside to the grill where I was grilling sausage. I was outside for about 5 minutes. I come back inside to see several noodles on the floor.

Anyway, I told him that mayo + toothpaste would make very little amounts of lidocaine and briefly showed him a copy of my organic chem textbook where we learned to make lidocaine (not from mayo and toothpaste\u2026.). \n\nSo yeah, he believed it and tried it on a few people and I only found out about it like 2 years later and told him the truth. Pretty funny stuff. He was one of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met but so gullible and has almost no street smarts. Great guy tho.",

The girls didn't believe me, but doubt set in when a day later I allowed myself to \"get caught\" bringing a plate of leftovers to the basement, and then pretended to hear grunting and the rattling of chains below our feet. \"Don't worry about it, it's just Jeremiah and Jebediah acting up,\" I said.

Fast forward a few months, my family and I was eating hotpot and a really nice ball filled with fish eggs was introduced to our dinner for the first time. My family was really curious and asked about its name. Being depressed, I was quite quiet most of the time but I decided to say the name of the anime I was watching called Asu no yoichi. With no smile and with absolute confidence as if I always knew it\u2019s name, my family believed me and used the name for years. \n\nTill this day, the name stuck and we still call it the name of the anime title despite everyone knowing the fact that it was a lie. But now I have to explain why I was watching a harem anime. The laughter it brought me while I was alone in my room cured my depression. \n\nTLDR: I called a hotpot ingredient the name of an anime. Everyone believed me because of my confidence. Years later, everyone found out the truth but still calls it the title of the anime. \nThat situation cured my depression.",

He was sent to the wizard prison because in the wizarding world, if you can practice magic you are tried as an adult. Since a lot of other things in the story are ass backwards, my friend bought it. I proceeded to talk about a hack job breakout event orchestrated by Hermione and Ginny, only to have Malfloy tag along. Of course Hagrid supplied a magical beast and Dumbledore gave them some item of importance to help them on their Journey. Harry and the twins had to go to the Ministry to clear Ron\u2019s name the Legal way with Mr. Weasley acting as their advisor. As the headmaster of Hogwarts, Dumbledore wasn\u2019t allowed to interfere. This went on for about 20 minutes until I couldn\u2019t stop laughing at the plot I had woven and I got beaten up for lying about Harry Potter.",
