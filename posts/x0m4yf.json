Nobody is out there condemning *every single cop* but the establishment of policing in this country is by and large corrupt, illl tempered, unprepared, quick to judge, quicker to violence, prone to abuse and unfit for the myriad of responsibilities delegated to them by society. There is also no accountability due to qualified immunity. If a guy gets fired for abusing his/her power they can just go one county over to the nearest precinct and get the same job there.\n\nBuilding a functional,  stable and prosperous society is kind of like building a house. It takes all sorts of people with all sorts of skills and tools to make it work. \n\nHowever in our present day America we have chosen to build all the houses with hammers... thats all. Just hammers.  After all, hammers *do* make up  a huge part of building any house.. Its the only tool we have invested in, so it's what we will use for everything. Window installation, wood working, electrical and plumbing. Hell, we will even use them for gardening and pool skimming.\n\nAnd as a result we have a house that is a mangled caricature at best. A drafty, unrefined, unrealized and unreliable distortion of what was promised. Full of rough cuts, sharp corners, leaky pipes and broken windows. Roof and floors are good... but it takes more than that.\n\nThe Police and the entire criminal justice system are responsible for  much injustice, pain and suffering in this country. yes. There are some good ones scattered about. But by and large in my 45 years of life  I have seen precious little of them. I served in thr Army and I served with many they went on to become civilian law enforcement.  And let me tell you that far far too many were NOT people that I or you would want with 100% or the power and 0% accountability. The Police have to be treated like any  other skilled labor.  They should be forced to pay for insurance like doctors to pay for their malpractice settlements rather than have Johnny taxpayer foot the bill for their arrogant incompetence and violent racially biased tendencies.\n\nAnd when they have too many strikes against them, they will be uninsurable and subsequently unemployable. So much thr better for society. \n\nTLDR\n- Police need to be held accountable like everyone else. \n- Society needs to invest in social programs that can handle some of  the various responsibilities law enforcement is tasked with.",

To use the law of averages to say that all cops cannot be bad is a good argument, and to say that they are people so it has to work out that they have both good and bad is a sound argument as well. However this argument can also be refuted by a couple of others. One way could relativity and arguing that being a LEO is a job that demands respect and power therefore LEO\u2019s are people who want or need respect and power and those kind of people are less worried about others and their actions and more concentrated on their own well being and safety and people following their rules, this would diminish their empathy and lead to people who are \u201cbad\u201d. I\u2019m just saying just as easy as one could argue that they can\u2019t all be bad one could argue that they are all bad. Either way, just food for thought. I can tell you from my POV this one was horrific and negativity impacted both of these guys lives. \n\nYou know the thought I\u2019ve always had and wondered how others thought about it\u2026. If an officer (like this one) is in the wrong and is just being terrible (at his job and a person) looks at a newly arriving officer and tells them to do something (the wrong thing in this case) is that wrong then the fault of the original officer or the responding/backup officer?",

I would disagree that this ONLY attracts power hungry people. \n\nPolice should be there to protect the people, and it would be unreasonable to assume that everybody who goes into that line of work goes in to it for power. I feel it\u2019s safe to assume that a lot of them go into it to help protect the innocent and do their part to fairly and safely uphold the law. \n\nObviously I\u2019m not referring to this video, because the cops in this video should be absolutely stripped of their badges for their heinous actions. \n\nAs to your thought at the end there, IMO it would be the fault of both. And yes, the new officer might be ostracized and pushed out of the force for talking back to or reporting a superior. I\u2019m not naive enough to think that doesn\u2019t happen. But everyone arguing this point with me are willfully ignoring the fact that that rookie was a good cop. They are saying he never existed as a cop. \n\nFurthermore, I think it\u2019s absurd to think that there was never a police precinct in the world where these good people became the majority in their force and ended up creating a just and decent police force. \n\nI would also thank you for putting forth a reply that is understanding of different views and also non-combative.

Actions like getting a gun out to shoot an officer.\n\nIt is easy to judge from a video clip,  but in reality there are a lot of people out there who will shoot an officer in a routine traffic stop.  A few years ago it happened here.  A routine traffic stop led to two officers being shot and killed.\n\nThis guy was am idiot for rolling up his window.  It looks suspicious as fuck when you do something like that.  And then was being belligerent about it.  Until the backup got there,  he was handcuffing the guy to search and make sure the guy didn't jave a weapon or drugs or something he was trying to hide.  When by yourself that is pretty common.\n\nSorru folks,  but the officer did everything right.",

          "text": "This is pretty standard way the cops routinely abuse their authority and trample on our rights. This isn\u2019t a rare incident and it\u2019s not even close to being among the worst. Check out the YouTube channels Lack Luster and Audit The Audit. Those are two of the best as far as production value and the context they provide when they present cases of police misconduct. They post new examples almost daily and they aren\u2019t hurting for new content for their respective channels. There are some that would cause you to seriously think you were asleep and dreaming you were in Nazi Germany. I know it\u2019s cliche to equate stuff with Nazis on the internet, but this is not hyperbole. You can almost hear the phrase \u201cpapers please\u201d being spoken in a German accent. One of the really bad ones recently was when some cops came to a 14 year old girls house because they had gotten a called about domestic violence between her and her boyfriend. Some random \u201chero\u201d called the cops and they went to talk to the boyfriend at the mall where he says it was nothing and he had no visible injuries and he didn\u2019t want to press charges. So the cops were feeling cock blocked I guess and decided to go \u201ctalk\u201d to the girl. They come to the house and her dad is outside with his little dogs doing years work. He asks whats up and they say they want to talk to his daughter. He tells them she\u2019s inside and they go knock on the door. She comes out and in less than a minute a \u201ctalk\u201d turns to them putting her in cuffs arresting her. The father is obviously not happy and it asking them what it\u2019s about. His voice is raised, but he;s not being agressive. They pull guns and tell him to drop his \u201cweapon\u201d, a garden hoe, which he does immediately while trying to defuse the situation . Meanwhile the dog is barking and the cops are afraid of a little dog and point the guns at it. So the dad runs over to pick up the dog and that\u2019s a reason for the cops to yell at him and then take him. I think they taze the dog too. All the while the other full grown male cop is roughing up the girl while she\u2019s screaming in terror and throws her to the ground. So now you got one cop on the 14 year old girl and another on the cop and the dog is still barking and the cop is yelling at the guy to tell the dog to back off. The guy asks if he can be let up so he can take control of the dog but the cop won;t let him. Then with the girl subdued the other cop goes and grabs the dog by the neck and lifts it up and the dogs not too happy about that so it\u2019s bearing its teeth and trying to bite the cop. Then the cop takes the dog to the front door and opens it then throws the dog by it\u2019s neck into the house. That was the end of the video. I think the DA dropped the charges because there was no complainant and since the cops didn\u2019t see the aleged domestic battery the testimony of the person that called the cops could only be considered hearsay. I think the dog had to be given to their relative that lives in the country because the dog had such severe anxiety after that and any time someone knocks on the door or rings the door bell he became super fearful  and aggressive even though he was never like that before. So all in all great work for our tax dollars. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be paying a lot more for the lawsuit that will inevitably be filed. That one really made me sick to my stomach. But there are plenty just as bad as that on those channels.",

Test regularly to ensure they know the laws they are enforcing. While we are at it, fitness test as well.\n\nOne full week per month of actual community service, still paid, but get to know the homeless and less well off people. \n\nOne mandatory therapy session per week. Its a job that can cause people to become jaded against the people they serve, so why not focus on their mental health.\n\nNo more black or dark navy blue uniforms. Not every copy should look like swat. On the same topic, lets go back to black and white cars.. not blacked out tinted with black letters and hidden lights. \n\nNo ticket revenue goes to the town budget.  Maybe it could be used to pay the lawsuits not taken from the pension, but even that could be improperly allocated, so I would prefer that all go to federal fund.  \n\nCentral database to capture all complaints and relevant job statistics such as legal actions, shootings, reprimands, and accommodations. Maybe consider implementing a point system similar to drivers licenses, 20 points and you can no longer be a cop, anywhere.

I realize that police are not an enemy, but their workplace is broken and that causes problems. \n\nI would never dream of putting an under prepared person in a demanding position, so why do we only provide a few months of training.  \n\nWe ask them to serve the public, but how can they serve people they never got the opportunity to know and can't possibly sympathize with. \n\nIf the job is high stress, why do we not provide counseling. Its akin to withholding medical staff from NFL players and expecting them to continue to play bruised, battered and broken. \n\nAnd finally, qualified immunity has taken away personal responsibility. I understand people can make mistakes, they happen even when we try our best  and I don't think punishment is always the best course of action. That said, when the mistake impacts someones rights, that tells me the officer was not qualified, so qualified immunity should be off the table the same way it should be when rules are ignored or broken.  \n\nThe more I think about it, the more I believe Police should have personal liability insurance, pay may need to change to reflect the base cost, but they would be on the hook as costs go up based on their actions. If they are good cops, they should be in favor of this as it would protect them financially and **should** cost them nothing. \n\nI have ideas for the rest of government as well... maybe Ill run for office one day. ;)",

The officer will interpret it differently than the filter and always in those favor of issuing a ticket.\n\nAlso the consequence for failing to comply after being issued a ticket is not mentioned, it is surely arrest\u2026\n\nDo you honestly believe that this law was passed by the reactionary state senate to benefit the filmer and \u201ckeep them safe?\u201d  This piece of shit legislation came about in the wake of blowback from the dozens/hundreds of recently filmed police brutality episodes.   \n\nYou absolutely know what this law was passed, to scare the public into filming police crimes less, and in the case of Arizona, create inroads to ID and harass people of color to check immigration status.\n\n[House Bill 2319](https://azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/2R/bills/HB2319S.pdf)",

And most locales have ill-defined laws or exception criteria for obstructing police duties so they can always broadly claim your filming is in their way at obnoxiously far distances, and even if you're not talking.\n\nWhat I still see most people get wrong in these types of situations is that _it hardly matters what is and isn't legal_ when you are interacting with the police. Everyone wants to put on the lawyer hat and suggest they know exactly what you can and cannot do with police, but there's actually one truth (by design) of police interactions is that they cannot be challenged on the street. They can arrest and detain you for whatever reasons, and the latter gives them a lot of leeway in terms of delivering violence your way -- which, if you respond to, is going to be why you will remain in trouble and justify whatever illegal actions the police took in almost any case.\n\nWhatever the police do that's \"wrong\" or illegal can only be sorted out by the legal process afterwards. At no point are citizens granted the legal authority to override whatever the police are presently doing. As we saw with George Floyd, this includes if you see a police officer murdering someone else. You _can_ take action and try to overpower the police, but everyone with sense has worked out that you had to have been willing and wanting to kill all of the cops around to stop that from happening.",

Like if this was me, I'd never be allowed to work in my industry again, my career would be immediately and permanently over.\n\nAnd this case stands out as one where things were actually made as right as they can be made in the end. It doesn't always go that way.",

I was very surprised and interested to learn this.\n\nEdit: I muddled up \"directives\" and \"regulations\" in my answer, now fixed.",

Legislation was passed to keep certain parts of EU law (the parts covered previously by the 1972 Act) whilst not being a member of the EU.\n\nAll these decisions were made by UK elected officials.

Winnebago County Department of Social Services* is a supreme court case which ruled that the police didn't have to protect a minor from his abusive father, just to arrest the father (whenever they felt like it). The boy ended up with severe brain damage due to one of the beatings.\n\nWhile it makes sense that police shouldn't be required to stop every crime, given they can't be everywhere at once, subsequent court cases have take the inch and ran a mile. Now, police officers can just watch a crime in progress, and as long as they follow up *eventually*, no punishment happens.\n\nThe only thing that forces a police officer to act is if \"the public\" is in danger. This would be, say, a bank robbery with hostages. Police must protect \"the public\", or those hostages inside the building. A police officer could do absolutely nothing if someone was mugged in front of them, because that mugger doesn't pose a danger to \"the public\". A police department doesn't even have to come when called if \"the public\" isn't in danger (such as with domestic violence).",

You see so much of it and think that it happens during most stops because you see it so often. But out of the thousands of these videos, that's only a very minute fraction of the whole of interactions with police. People lose perspective alot in these areas and don't look at the whole and blanket everything in their mind with this being the outcome the majority of the time. With there being right at 1 million police to 340 million citizens, there are a shit ton of interactions with police you don't see make it to video or on a social media platform.

I'm talking about a genuine bad guy stealing your phone, then let's say placing a call to a rogue foreign phone operator to rack up thousands of dollars of phone bill. That's a pretty common thing to do with a stolen phone. They'll also have access to your email accounts etc. that they can use for identity theft.\n\nI mean, you seem to think you're security minded, and you're not even aware of this stuff?",

A face is harder to steal than a PIN.\n\n>Each app, especially banking has an extra line of security\u2026 with \u2026 wait for it, another password.\n\nI doubt very many people have configured their email client to ask for a password every time they open it on their phone. If you have, kudos.\n\n>SECURITY QUESTIONS.\n\nBy your use of CAPS I can only assume you consider security questions to be a strong form of security. If any service uses security questions, their security policies are straight from the 90s.",

They could see on their computers that the car was registered, insured, and the primary driver (me) had no warrants, no record, no traffic infractions (for 20+ years). I pulled over immediately into a gas station that was less than 1000 ft away from me, turned off the car with the windows down and hands on the wheel.  2 officers pull up to join the initial office and approach the vehicle with their weapons drawn.  Immediately asked to step out of the car.  I refused and asked if I was being detained and for what reasons.  I was 'under investigation for not having my sticker on my tag'. Not a citable offence in my state.  Guess my real crime was being brown and driving a nice car. \n\nMy wife got pulled over at the same intersection for completely forgetting to renew her registration and the one officer gave her a citation and left.  Of course she is white.  \n\nCan't make this bullshit up.",

I do know there are systems out there that have a methodology for flagging a swipe, keypass, scan, pin entry, etc as invalid to force another swipe or induce a second level of screening in the effort to appear random, however that does not mean all searches or secondary screening are due to true probable cause or indication by a device. There is a LOT of bias in the security industry when it comes to personnel as there are very few jobs in the big picture where security personnel are trained to prevent bias in threat assessment or risk mitigation.",

He became visibly agitated but figured he couldn't press any further especially now that people were staring at the gas station.  He said 'put it on when you get home or I will arrest you next time I see you driving through here.' all 3 officers walked back to their cars and left.  I took a different route home because I didn't want to head the direction I saw them go in for fear of running into them again in a less populated area.",

He was driving the speed limit, doing nothing or if the ordinary except for apparently being Black and driving a BMW in Farmington Utah. A cop driving the opposite way turned around and pulled him over. The first question asked was, \"is this your car?\" He stated it was a work vehicle and the cop says, \"so it's not your car?\"\n\nThe cop refused to believe anything that he said, and ended up calling our manager and asking, \"are you missing a vehicle?\" When the cop was told that our employee was using it, and gave a description of him he just told us to have a nice day and just left. After holding him on the side of the road for almost an hour. \n\nShit is absolutely ridiculous. And yet somehow some people don't see a problem.",

The ticket was $500. My bail? $20,000. It was so egregious that the black women in jail with me (I remember one specifically was in for armed robbery, not her first offense, and had a $10,000 bail) felt bad for *me*, which was awesome because they kept my naive ass safe while I was in there for 4 days. If I had lied to the judge and just written a check for the ticket then asked my grandmother to help me cover it, ironically I wouldn't have experienced any of this. I also found out that an 8 man SWAT team had been sent to my former apartment (if just moved a month before) where I lived alone with my 4 year old child. Again, this was over a 6 month old car registration and insurance ticket I had already been to court for but couldn't afford the payments so I went back to court. Even the sheriff's deputies in jail said I must have reminded the judge of someone he hated. This was in 1998 and I have had cop/court-related PTSD ever since.

Just telling my story as a white guy.\n\nThis was in the time before body cams. One time I was with my brother. He was driving, I was in the passenger seat, and we had a drunk friend sitting in the back seat. We were driving him to the metro station so he could head downtown because he was already drunk and didn't want to drive. Pulled into the station and discovered it was closed for the evening (it was already pretty late). We pulled into a parking space so my brother could Google directions/hours for the next closest station and sat there for maybe 5 minutes. Got it set, pulled out of the station parking lot and my brother went to turn left, realizing it was a one-way, stopped mid-turn, put it in reverse, and turned right instead. Mind you, there was zero traffic so this wasn't a dangerous or disruptive maneuver.\n\nAs we got into the road (going the correct direction), an unmarked car comes flying up behind us, sirens wailing. Brother puts on his 4-ways to indicate he would pull over, drives to the end of the one-way, pulls onto a two-way street that was much safer to stop on, and pulls over. 4 plain-clothes officers jump out of the car, guns drawn, and surround the car screaming at us. All 4 cops were screaming something different. One was yelling hands where I can see them, one was yelling get out of the car, one was yelling stay where you are. We were confused so we just put our hands on the dash and sat there it was a 2 door car, so the cops pull open my door and my brother's door, roughly drag us out of the car, face down on the street, knee to the middle of the back and cuffed us, mind you, neither of us resisted, and the third guy who was drunk and underage was in the back seat still.\n\nThey picked us up by the handcuffs, which did not feel good on my already bad shoulders, threw us over the hood of the car, and searched us roughly. I had a small pocket knife in my pocket, and a pretty nice one too (I still have it) a Benchmade Griptilian with a 3.5 inch blade (you can have up to 4 inches in Ohio) completely legal, that I used for work (I was working in a stockroom and cut open boxes all day). It was like a $150 knife and it was a gift from my girlfriend at the time. The cop slapped it down on the hood, damaging the car and started screaming at me asking why I had it. I said for work and he questioned what I do for work before radioing in anyways that I was carrying a deadly weapon and they needed backup.\n\nBy this time I was pissed but still super confused and asked what I did wrong, and they just kept telling at me to shut up. They split us up, questioned us over and over asking the same questions repeatedly. Never took the drunk guy out of the back seat. I'm not even sure they knew he was there even though we told them why we were at the metro station. We didn't have to lie because we weren't doing anything wrong. Eventually the chief arrived and told them to cut us free and told us to go home. They gave my brother a citation for going the wrong way in a one-way, distributing the flow of traffic, and failing to signal (once again, there was not a single car in sight).\n\nWhen the cops let us go and went back to their car and we were sitting in our car, I realized that they never gave my knife back so I got out of the car with my hands up and two of the officers jumped out of their car and drew their guns on me again. I said I needed my LEGAL knife back for work and the guy looked pissed off and took it out of his pocket and threw it into the street and got back in the car. I went and picked it up and we left.\n\nThe shit part, aside from them fucking over my brother for no reason at all, was that the only one who was doing something illegal was the kid in the backseat who was drunk underage. They never asked him for ID, questioned him, or even got him out of the car. I'm glad they didn't, buy if they had, they could have made a legitimate arrest that night but instead decided to just fuck with us for no reason at all. Neither me or my brother had a criminal record and up until then, my brother had a clean driving record.\n\nThe only thing I can think of, based on the plain clothes and unmarked car, was that they were doing a sting operation at that closed metro station and had set a trap for some drug dealers or something then they got us instead. Got pissed when we didn't have any drugs on us and decided to be pieces of shit instead of admitting their mistake and apologizing.\n\nThis was the day that I decided that cops aren't there to protect the public and are mostly just a bunch of scumbag bullies on a power trip. I imagine it would have been much worse if either of the three of us were black.",

I have a neighbor and also a good friend who's like a son to me (both white) that are cops and I consider them helpful and respectful individuals who honestly want to help people.  In my experience they are the exception to the rule unfortunately.  The whole system is stacked. Fines are just punishment for the low income.  Pot as a schedule 1 is just funding private prisons. Speed traps are just revenue generation that doesn't go back into infrastructure and again is punishment for the low income groups.  The concept of using victimless crimes as means to search or detain people by way of traffic stop with the hope of finding unlinked incriminating evidence is a scam to again feed revenue or continue cycles of poverty and filling prisons.  And with the modern use of victims recording traffic stops it's only becoming more clear how rampant this is in America.",

You can bet your ass that they had cops lined up at 2:59 waiting for the clock to tick to 3:00 with a fleet of tow trucks so they could start writing tickets and impounding cars.\n\nAs you said, this was only punishment to the poor. Happened to me twice.\n\nThe shittiest part was the tow company would ONLY accept cash, so you couldn't get your car out with a credit card. Then they had a $10 PER DAY penalty. So if your car gets towed Monday but you don't have the cash until Friday, you have to pay an extra $40 on top of the $110 they charge you by default. If you didn't get your car out within 30 days and couldn't pay the $410 fee to get it out, they could LEGALLY SELL YOUR FUCKING CAR AT PUBLIC AUCTION.\n\nThe cops made sport of this and I would oftentimes see them waiting on the side of the road bullshitting with the truck drivers just waiting to ruin someone's day. They would steal your car and either sell it back to you or sell it to someone else.\n\nMeanwhile, not even a block away, I had a storage unit that was broken into three Saturdays in a row and they just kinda said, \"Oh well, these things happen.\" All about revenue.",

In my state, the sticker on the tag is not citable, and the officer would have known the car was not reported stolen, the tag was registered and on the proper vehicle, the vehicle was in mint condition (no lights out, no roadworthy issues or citable offences). All he had was no sticker on the tag, while I was stopped one car back from a light with adequate space in front of me to not be following too close. So what would give him legal cause to detain me or ask me to leave my vehicle?",

You can challenge it, but it's better to just step out, or it can be a charge by itself. Nothing is gained by staying in the vehicle.  If you feel the officer is extending the stop by having you step out that could work in your benefit.",

Each person has the ability to make their own choices and decide their actions.  I've seen people of color be total racists as well.  My parents were racist against black people because at the time a large number of black families were moving into our neighborhood (early 1980's Atlanta) and the white neighbors had my immigrant parents convinced that black families brought crime and violence.  It's the only thing my mom ever did that disappointed me.  \n\nHate will always exist.  Luckily there is more love than hate in this world and we have to remind ourselves to unplug from media so we can experience that truth.  I had a white officer help me push my car uphill into a parking lot on a 100\u00b0f day when he happened to drive by and saw me sitting there with a dead transmission on the side of the road.  In highschool I had a white friend who would toss hands in an instant if anyone bullied me. Hell that happened a lot given I was one of 10 people of color in my highschool graduating class of nearly 500 kids.  \n\nSome of my closest friends have been what one might think of as backwoods rednecks because they have white skin, a southern draw, 4 wheelers, and listen to country music.  \n\nJudge a person on the content of their character not the color of their skin.  We are all capable of heinous acts, and we are all capable of love.  \n\nCan we eradicate racism. Nope. It's human nature to develop prejudice based on environmental influences.  Can we teach people to think critically about their choices, yes.  Do people of color need to own their culture's issues, and address them ,yes (just as much as white people). \n\n I think the real path to fixing this is 3 parts.  \n\n1. People in the US need to recognize racism exists all over and isn't only a problem in the USA but we have a platform that is not used effectively.  Look at most countries and you'll see homogeneous groups of people.  They haven't had to understand and learn to live with other cultures.  For example many Asian countries have very few white, black or Latin people. And look at regions split by religion like in the middle east. People kill people because of a mythical wizard.  Their culture reflects it too.  Here in the USA we have diversity that you do not see elsewhere, which influences the positive sides of our culture to come together.  It also forces us to see the ugly side of racism because we are so diverse.  We have the chance to show the rest of the world how cultures can live in harmony and the freedom to do so.  We need to seize that by calling out racism and then talking action against it using our money, our ballots, and our voices.  \n\n2. We have to greatly reduce the income gap between the lowest earners and the highest earners.  This forces policy change as those with money and power would have to be accountable and affected as much as those without. It removes the ability to hold people in positions of poverty. There much more to it but I can only type out so much of this novel on my phone.\n\n3. We need to reform education by moving money from police departments, private prisons, and military spending, into education.  Too many kids do not have the opportunity to experience so much of life and learning when they are in school because either they or their school cannot afford to provide it.  My kids did not grow up in the highest funded school systems, but not the lowest either. I spent money I didn't have to ensure they had opportunities to experience new things.  Now I have a child under 20yrs old who will graduate college at 20 debt free due to scholarships. Another is about to start a full ride at a university with a major in mechanical engineering and specialties in machine learning and biomechanics because of how excited he was about his robotics program at his school.  They worked hard, but had opportunities so many kids do not. Too often those kids enter a cycle of poverty and prison time.  This feeds stereotypes that feed racism.  \n\nI'm sure I've misspoke or mistyped some stuff since this is all on my phone but I hope people get the gist. I don't care if people disagree with respectful discourse, but this blew up into a lot of comments and I'm running out of steam to respond.",

They have full access to see if a tag is legally registered and on the vehicle it belongs to. The sticker is a fucking formality and was there for their convenience prior to databases with that information at their fingertips. The use of shit like this or burned out taillights to stop people is just a means to violate their liberty in the pursuit of inflating their ego if they catch someone doing dirty but more often than not, just is an inconvenience at best. I remember seeing a cop next to me in traffic and he had a headlight out. I rolled down my window and gestured to him and he rolled his window down. I kindly let him know that his headlight was out in case he wasn't aware. His response \"I know, it's a temp car mines in the shop. Mind your own fucking business.\"  I don't think that would go over well if I had the same response to a cop. Full transparency, that cop was black. He might have been having a bad day, but damn a dude tries to be helpful and this is how I'm treated. That guy can fuck off too. If I can get stopped for a headlight, he sure as hell should be open to someone notifying him about his headlight being out.",

I've gone over that day so many times trying to figure out what I did wrong... and it took way to long for me to come to the understanding that I did nothing wrong.

He absolutely should not be a police officer anymore.  1) he had just tackled and knelt on a 12 year old playing with an orange and blue nerf gun, handcuffed him, scratching his face up and screaming profanities at the poor kid who doesn't want to play outside anymore.  THEN erased the body cam footage after the parents wanted to see it, stating it would be too upsetting for the parents, though he was still 'within his rights as an officer' by doing what he did. \n\nThat should not get a demotion, and a taxpayer footed lawsuit. That should get jail time, and no more career. \n\nPeriod.",

Average attendance at our meetings was usually about 4 people - until I roused a rabble to fight a state road project and got a couple hundred people there. I also fought a group of right wing extremists who wanted to do an open-carry march/inspection of our neighborhoods looking for \"dirtbags who didn't belong\". That was some scary shit.  \n  \nBut seriously. You want to change things? Get involved in your city government. Start by attending the occasional council meeting and get your friends and neighbors involved.",

Cops are shit scared someone pulls a gun on them, therefore they react like this, and therefore people are treated like shit like this and the spiral goes on.  \n\n\nEdit: for the people who downvote me: I'm totally fine with effort being put into getting that guy into jail. But if you want change there is a lot more to do than giving people punishment. Putting this guy into jail shouldn't get all the attention, getting a proper policeforce that can be trusted by society should be priority.",

Well 5% of federal funds go to Function 750 (Administration of Justice) in 2019 this was $65,600,000,000. Then state taxes are seperate, as well as municipal taxes. These will all very depending on your location and by how many taxable transactions you participate in. Also many government grants are seperate from this which would vary greatly.\n\nhttps://prospect.org/economy/tax-dollars-really-go/\n\nA better way is to look at the departments funding, again this will vary WILDLY by department. This is public information and I suggest you look into your own department.\n\n\"some municipalities devote most of their property tax earnings to public pensions, as was recently the case in a few Chicago suburbs, according to the Daily Herald. The suburb of Lombard, for example, collected around $9.3 million in property taxes in 2018 but contributed around 91 percent of that total\u2014nearly $8.6 million\u2014to pensions as it worked toward a 2040 deadline for its police and fire pension programs.\n\nIn 2020, City Journal reported that the New York Police Department\u2019s pensions account for more than half of the department\u2019s $2.8 billion budget increase over the last 10 years\u2014and that pensions, fringe benefits, and debt service account for 49 percent of the NYPD\u2019s budget.\"\n\nhttps://marketrealist.com/p/do-taxes-pay-for-police-officers/\n\n\"The money for policing comes from local governments, state governments, and federal programs. However, most police spending comes from local governments. In 2017, for instance, local governments accounted for about 87% of that spending.\u00a0Police spending by state governments in that year, which mostly went to funding highway patrols, represented about 1% of direct expenditures. By contrast, it represented 13% of direct expenditures at the municipal level, 9% for townships, and 8% for counties. State governments spend more on corrections than local governments, and the level of spending is about even on courts.1\n\nFigures from the U.S. Census of Governments indicate that state and local governments together expended $123 billion on police in 2019. They spent another $132 billion on courts and corrections. As such, this is one of the biggest expenses for local governments. The money goes almost entirely to operational costs. In 2019, for instance, 97% of police and courts spending at the state and local levels went to salaries and benefits, and 98% of state and local corrections spending went toward salaries and benefits.\"\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/how-are-police-departments-funded-5115578\n\nSeems like a lot more than 1% tbh.\n\nAlso IF a significant portion of police funding if from a private source that can come with its own problem and thus should be avoided if possible\n\nhttp://www.wipsociology.org/2018/07/03/donation-or-bribe-how-police-departments-manage-the-ambiguities-of-gifts/\n\nI am finding if really impossible to find out how much the average department receives in donations as a percentage of total funding, if you have a source for that I would love to read it.\n\n\"Funding source\tAmount\tpercent\nFederal dollars\t$6.6 million\t9.2%\nLocal option tax\t$15.3 million\t21.2%\nproperty taxes\t$ 13.6 million\t19.2%\nState BEP funding\t$37.3 million\t51.2%\"\n\nhttps://www.wjhl.com/news/defunding-the-police-analysis-breaks-down-area-law-enforcement-budget-sources/\n\nI found this specific department had a chart which included the entire funding by source, mostly state funding but it leaves .2% from unlisted source, some portion of this would be the donations you are talking about.\n\nCivilian oversight would work if they have the power to jail people as punishmennt, of course there would be other options but without that ultimately any fine issued or rule set would be able to be ignored. \n\nMandatory malpractice insurance sounds like it may be helpful. Of course some police misconduct would need to be handled by criminal courts and I do fear this would be less accessible if every complaint could be met with \"you have to talk to the insurance agency.\" And then you have the same issues inherent with all insurance companies, namingly the \"David vs Goliath\" aspect of going against them to get the justice a victim deserves.\n\nOh I also wanted to put out that a lot of the \"goodies\" are army surplus and were already bought with taxpayer dollars. In fact this kind of \"synergy\" between government organizations is quite common and makes tracking tax dollars even more difficult. Another interesting scenario is when a company gets government funding and then discounts police, is that your tax dollars going to the police? Hard to say.",

They are often guaranteed with incremental COLA increases, too.\n\nThat\u2019s different to the private 401k benefit that is a \u201cdefined contribution\u201d where we pay into the market and the employer matches a portion. In that scenario the risk is on you to accumulate sufficient funds to retire, and hopefully the market swings don\u2019t knock you out. (Cops usually get this to supplement their defined benefit pensions, too.)\n\nGiven the options, I\u2019d take the former pension 100 times out of 100.",

Police are entitled to 100% of pension contributions as a refund upon resignation or termination. They also get a portion of the employers contributions too.  (The ROI of the police pension is about 13%) The only way time matters is if the officer completely retires and then their monthly payments are based on years served and average salary. Often times in cases of deadly force officers will retire with disabled status (usually claiming PTSD) which is their pension multiplied by 20 years. Don't get this twisted. Resignation is not accountability. He resigned, got a large lump sum payment and then moved to another force in a different city. It was all paid by tax payers.",

So even when you see something \"newer\"  like a Stryker or whatever, those are still very vulnerable to molten copper cutting through them and slicing everyone inside into pieces.

What happens is cops will pull you over like this kid for a wide left turn, they ask to search your vehicle, you tell them no, then they arrest you for the wide turn and then get to search your vehicle as part of the arrest. \n\nKid was exercising his rights and the cops didn\u2019t like it. He\u2019s not required to have his window fully open. Only enough to slip thru documents and to talk. That\u2019s why the kid rolled his window up. And that\u2019s why he was continuing to roll it up when he was exiting. Cops just don\u2019t like when constitutional rights get in the way of their authority.",

Case law only applies to setting precedent in lesser courts.  Comparing this case law to the second amendment is like someone comparing the discrimination against cops to the discrimination of minorities.

It was similar to an SAT test but waaaaaay simpler. Basic math, a few English language questions, very simple logic questions. Only the top 10% got to move on. They graded the scan tron sheets on site so we knew who those that advanced were right away. \n\nSecond step was an obstacle course. Drag a weight similar to a body twenty yards, run up some stairs, run down. Get through an open window, run some cone drills, get over a chain link fence, get over a brick wall. Nothing too complicated. But it was on a head field that I noticed was slightly damp so I made a choice to run controlled and careful, not emphasizing speed but rather precision. Some of the idiots there were crazy. One guy tried to jump down the flight of stairs instead of jogging down. Busted up his ankle, out. Another guy tried to drive through the window and tuck and roll the other side. Clipped his shoulder on the frame, hurt badly. Others sprinted like maniacs through the cones, fell on their butts in the wet grass. Slow times. One attempted to Olympic hurdle the chain link fence, caught his sack on the top, blood everywhere. My careful basically jog through netted me a top five finish and advancement onto the final round.\n\nThird and final step. Interview in a windowless room. They threatened that I shouldn't lie bc next step was a lie detector test. First question, have you ever done drugs. I said yeah in college I smoked a little weed at parties. They then asked for names of the people who smoked with me, who gave me the drugs, address of the house I smoked at. I told them I'm not answering any of that bc this is a job interview and not relevant. They said if I wanted the job I had to. I responded with not gonna happen bc I was high and can't remember any of that, laid on the sarcasm thick.  They leave me in that room alone for probably thirty, maybe forty minutes. Long enough I thought I should maybe get up and leave. They come back and ask again if I'm gonna give names. I asked them honestly, it felt like they either wanted a snitch, a liar or someone who has never been around a drug ever and wouldn't know what the signs are of drug intoxication bc of lack of experience. They asked again for names. I said sorry I'm not a snitch and this is a job interview not an interrogation. I got up and left, they told me not to bother applying again. I said yeah, no worries policing is obviously for snitches, idiots and liars. Not for me.",

Criminals will get free representation from anti-police attorneys. The cops would have to pay and risk judgments against them.\n\nThis was a small sampling of the results for a search of \"qualified immunity bills\".

I guess it's easier to pretend you're in some cool club where you've swallowed the red pill, allowing you to put the \"partisans\" into a box so that you can dismiss anything they have to say that challenges your worldview without having to think about it critically.",

I\u2019m not only for *criminalizing* immunity, but also indemnification.  Not only for cops, but for *all* governmental employees.  I believe they should carry insurance, and have immunity from criminal liability only if they were acting entirely within the scope of their duties.  I also believe we should eliminate all statutes of limitation for crimes committed by government employees.  I also believe that any lawyer should be able to seat a grand jury and act as prosecutor if the subject is a governmental employee.\n\nI actually want to reform the criminal justice system.  Democrats and Republicans don\u2019t.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Look  people I know a lot of you are pissed because this officer ignores the law and beats people worse than the criminals he should be arresting.  But relax every one because we can keep officer asshole we just need 100,000 of your tax dollars to cover his future abuse of power.  Yes we know we could get a clean new officer for that money but we decided the money is better spent to retain a criminal who costs 2  officers worth of money.",

Happy to discuss and changes as people see fit. \n\n\nInsurance Standards for Police:\n\nEvery police officer must carry insurance for up to 2 million in liability. \n\nIf you do something that breaks the law. Your insurance pays out, not the taxpayer. Then your premiums go up. Depending on severity the premiums may price you out of being a cop. \n\nBody cam found turned off? $1,000 fine 10% Premium hike. \n\nBody cams not on where a charge becomes a felony? $5000 fine. 15% premium hike\n\nBody cam footage will be reviewed randomly by a 3rd party for each precinct. A precinct cannot go 3 years without being reviewed. If footage is missing for different reports. Entire precinct hike 2% on insurance premiums. \n\n3 raises in insurance because of one officer? \n\nHe\u2019ll be fired or priced out. \n\nIn charge of folks who act out? \n\nYour premium goes up as a % as well. Sergeants, Captains and Chiefs are responsible in percentages that effect them. \n\n3% / 2% / 1% respectively. \n\nRate hikes follow the same structure as far as the chain of command goes for their department. \n\nAny settlement over 2 million comes from the pension fund. No taxpayer money involved. Any and all payments outside of the insurance pool come from  police pension funds \n\nThese premiums and rates are documented at a national level so there\u2019s no restarting in the next city/county/state \n\nYour insurance record follows you. \n\nIt\u2019s not even that crazy. So many professions require insurance. \n\nYou\u2019d see a new police force in 6 months.\n\nAnyone against this is supporting an unaccounted militarized force of people who answer to no one.

A local officer who he knew confided in him and told him \"the psych exam came back questionable - your answers related to you not knowing who your dad is raised questions and hurt your chances.\" No joke.\n- Increase accountability (both overtly and by virtue of the next bulletpoint)\n- Require they have their own malpractice insurance, and back out the municipality from the equation. That means that officers are either prohibited from being indemnified by the municipality for purposes of a lawsuit, or that decision is made some other way on a case-by-case basis. If you're sued, you will rely on your insurance and your union to navigate the next steps - no more municipal funds going into it. \n- Review union contracts to increase accountability.",

It's true that in some instances doctors may maintain their own individual malpractice coverage, but I don't really think that is a model that makes sense for police officers. Doctors are licensed professionals who can operate under their own supervision or set up their own practices. Police officers are not licensed professionals, they are only police officers as long as they are employed by the state to be police officers. I think it's appropriate for the state to cover their misconduct, just as I think it would be appropriate for USPS to cover the cost of a mail truck accidentally scratching your car.\n\nAgain, if taxpayers want to pay less money in settlements or liability coverage for police misconduct, the solution is for taxpayers to vote in better hiring & training policies & better oversight of the police. Officers like this keep their jobs and remain on the streets because of the political choices made by American voters.",

The cost of liability insurance of a police officer from a third party insurance company would make the job even for a new cop with no complaints would very likely be too high to make it worth working in the profession. \n\nI do certainly agree there needs to be something to hold accountable cops that act like this, but the whole insurance thing is just not going to happen.  If it does police dept. would have to cover the premiums, if not directly, but in the increase in salary to make this possible. So no matter what, the tax payers will pay for it in the end. \n\nI think more like a federal database that require all these type of events be recorded, and that actions like this, have the person removed from the ability to work in law enforcement nation wide.  But I freely admit it isn't hard to see how that would just lead to a suppression of reporting.",

I'm guessing the senior officer on site was the one arresting the younger male, when the father smarted off at him, he decided to go on a power trip and instead of having the other officer just keep an eye on the father, he told him to arrest him, when given an order by a senior officer, I'm not saying it should be followed blindly like shown here, but it is also at the risk of your own job not to follow it. Therefore I don't believe the second officer was on some power trip, they were just preserving their job by doing as told, I do want to point out that from what I can tell, I may be wrong, he was hesitant to start pepper spraying the dad, he had to be told to multiple times before he did it and he kept giving warnings. The senior officer however like I said was just on a power trip and more than likely trying to get a hold of the fathers phone as an attempt to destroy evidence of the officers actions.",

If you are gonna try and start an argument here, I'm done talking, however I will answer your question. \n1. \"What was he supposed to do?\" To simply avoid anything more, simply comply, inform them he is placing the phone inside his pocket. As when they check the video footage from the police, they would see they knew very well all he did was film their actions which is completely legal, then as to comply with their requested actions and to avoid complications, informed them he would be placing his phone in his pocket. There would've been no reason for them to reach inside his pocket and take his phone as there is no reason to suspect he did anything and honestly might've got more money if he did do that as that means they would've performed a search on his person without reasonable suspicion. \n\n2. No, as he has every right to be there. \n\n\n3.No, once again, I am not defending their actions.",

I think this particularly struck me because it\u2019s similar to a situation I had where I was harassed and falsely arrested because the cop thought I had drugs (it was soap that melted in the heat.) But I could tell he was looking for anything because he was tailing me for a while. Since he didn\u2019t have cause to pull me over he waited until I got out of the car to question me. I told him I was going to my doctor. He said fine and then (stupid me) I said teasing \u201cdid you think I had drugs or something?\u201d I was being friendly and I thought it\u2019s just a silly joke. He said, \u201cwhat did you say?! Turn around, you\u2019re under arrest.\u201d I was crying in his car and he got totally off on it. \u201cYou ever been arrested before?!\u201d I said no, I didn\u2019t understand what was happening. \u201cYou have drugs and I\u2019ll prove it!\u201d Then I was severely harassed in the station. They were laughing at me while I was hysterically crying. They kept me there for hours until I finally called my mom. I didn\u2019t want to worry her but I realized they weren\u2019t going to let me go. They told my mom that I was a prostitute who was soliciting guys with my pimp named Damian. My mom of course knew that was ridiculous and said, \u201cwell I know she has a personal trainer.\u201d Finally they agreed to let me go but not before yelling at me, \u201cconsider yourself lucky!\u201d When I went to court the judge apologized to me and felt so bad for my experience. I was absolutely destroyed by the experience because at the time I was a 20 year old college student and didn\u2019t understand why I was targeted. \n\nSorry, I know that\u2019s a long backstory but I think that\u2019s why I had such a visceral response to that cop. Looking back at it I realize that it\u2019s probably unresolved trauma that I never thought about until just now. \n\nI hope that explains a bit of my reaction. I think I\u2019ll stick to commenting on cute pet videos and reality tv gossip here on Reddit. I don\u2019t want to upset anybody because of my very subjective POV.

Also, while it's clearly your choice what you do and don't comment on, the way I see it, you should never worry prior to if your view, no matter how subjective, will upset someone. The only way for others to understand is to talk about it (if you yourself are willing to) and if they are willing to listen, if they just get upset and start throwing things like insults for example, you know who is unable to open their mind to other views, and those who will calmly speak with you, those are people who would appreciate your view. Oh and thank you very much for your kindness, I wish you have the best of luck in all your endeavors :)",

It looked perfectly calm until the driver pulled up a gun and tried to shoot the female police officer. Yes, that situation was at night, and the person more suspicious. But that is the risk that every police officer faces when they walk up to a car. So as a citizen, I would do everything to put them at ease, and not increase tension.\n\nThe situation of \"civilian smarts off at you, so you go on a power trip\" is just something that should be eliminated by training. You just cannot have that, at all. And I mean, that is where the situation really escalated. Arresting the driver was too much, yes, but that is what I would have left it at. The guy acted odd, and the police officer went too far, done and done. But the way they just took down that adult that was filming everything is just completely out of register.",

Two person verification when you take a drive. And then two person verification when you sanitize them after youre done. You have 3 hours from when you pull the first bad drive before you're considered toxic and security comes to find you. Security knows the serial of every drive you take in. Every drive you touch is going to have it's serial associated with you in a audit trail.  Every s3 drive is behind a security cable and cage that triggers an alarm if it gets slightly bumped, at which point, security is coming to talk to you.\n\n>dcs were so secure nothing would ever get stolen from anywhere,\n\nAfter laughing at how much security we have in the first sentence.

Checksums have been used for ages since data storage & transmission is unreliable.

On average that would be about 2.25 GB worth of storage required for the standard 8 hour working day.

The price of common storage varieties ranges from $3.99/TB online storage servers to a 50 dollar 1TB harddrive. That averages $183K per month. \n\nNow that may be \"low\" considering that it covers the whole of US but what needs to be looked at is the compounding effect of these costs. Alot of lawsuits where the proofs are needed take a decent amount to settle. Going from 3 months to a year. Realistically, this means that you'd need to store the data for atleast a decent amount of time to see any realistic benefit. \n\nEach month that passes, you incur not only the cost of storing the data but also the already existing data. So the first month $183K then the 2nd $366K ,the next. In total, storing the data for only a year would cost 14.3 Million dollars.",

Now, if you want to store data for 1 year, we are talking 120k per year.\n\nNew York has over 15,000 body cams in use... Their costs must be in millions.",

At the end of the day, they choose their careers and feeding their families, but this still means they are very much complicit in these crimes. \n\nThis has always and ever been the norm. The issue is you're seeing it.  The whole world is seeing it, openly, for the first time. And I want you to think hard about this:\n\n \ud835\udc7b\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc89\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc98 \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc82\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc98\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc8c\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc98 \ud835\udc9a\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc96'\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc88\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc82 \ud835\udc94\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95.\n\nImagine how they acted when there were no cameras and they knew their 'brothers' had their back. Rodney king was the first in a long line of exposed inherently racist, bullying, autonomously judging of its own behavior, policy the force has been for a long as police have been a thing.  Indeed, the birth of what we now know as the 'police force' began as a slave patrol to quash any thoughts of uprising and 'keep them in their place'.\n\nhttps://naacp.org/find-resources/history-explained/origins-modern-day-policing#:~:text=The%20origins%20of%20modern%2Dday,runaway%20slaves%20to%20their%20owners.\n\nThe song 'This Is America' has a very powerful double ententre in it that I cannot stress enough: \"This a celly/ \nThat's a tool\"\n\nThe line has two meanings. One is, \ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc85 \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc89\ud835\udc86 \ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc91\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc91\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc93\ud835\udc95, a cellphone is a tool today. When you see anyone,  particularly POC, being arrested or detained, it's your civic duty to record them, if you feel this is unfair, like the majority of us do. \n\nThe other meaning is the cell(y) block they're standing in while singing this, referring to the revival of slavery/indentured servants through 'correctional facilities' being pimped out to large corporations like Victoria's secret and walmart for inmates who makes a few pennies an hour, but cannot even get a Tylenol without earning the money somehow. If you so much as get sick and they render aid, you owe every penny of that through these companies, before you can start earning commissary money again. (Source: my father was a big methhead, I know, big surprise when you hear my family is racist right? And to even get him to the doctor I had to pay off any debts he'd accrued from previous sickness. He had cancer btw, and couldn't even but Tylenol for the pain before paying it off, which is why he called me and asked for help.  There how we found out it was cancer, to the people that say 'oh they have to treat your illnesses.. no they very don't if they never acknowledge them to begin with.)\n\n And the police also make a good deal of their money through ticketing and arrests; they have a prerequisite of how many they must have every month. I heard they had changed they policy but I'll look into it. \n\nThese places are no longer meant to correct behavior, if it ever truly was, but to enforce and worsen it in the most vulnerable of our population. They're a commodity now.  \n\nAnyway, /rant, but this is a subject I've felt extremely deeply about since sitting around the racist ass, homophobic ass table of my family since I was a kid. Even then I knew it was wrong, and that was like 35 years ago.  \n\nIt's always been fucked up.\n\nP.s. the police force is a very attractive career for the sociopaths/psychopaths in our society, as is any position of power that lends itself to be easily abused. If you don't believe me, take it from the horse's mouth, as it were; A word of warning from a former officer  who couldn't in good conscience stay silent. He's far from the only one if you start digging. \n\nhttps://www.gcrr.org/post/fewbadapplesmyth",

There are innumerable reasons why vast majority of developed countries in the world require at least twice the amount of training that the US does.\n\nOr we can continue with the unwarranted police brutality (like pepper spaying and arresting innocent bystanders costing settlement of $200K in this case) to costing innocent civilian lives and taxpayers tens if not hundreds of millions annually when weighed nationwide.\n\nThose cell phone and other cameras are everywhere now, police can't get away with their crimes as easily as they could 25 years ago, time for the police to improve the quality and quantity of the training, the quality of officers in a very difficult profession and ultimately improve the policing significantly.",

So far, in 2022, German police has killed 5 people. That's probably about the number US police have killed this week alone.

Any cop who knows that another cop is doing the wrong thing and doesn't report it/covers their ass is just as guilty as the bad cop. But for you to condemn the entirety of such a diverse group of people is hypocritical and ignorant unless you are willing to carry that judgement over to other groups of people, which you wouldn't dare to do because you are nothing more than an immature and self righteous hypocrite that only applies their judgemental thinking where they feel safe doing so because it is the popular opinion of the herd thinking that permeates the left. It's simple, either apply your logic across the board or you're a hypocrite.",

So by forgiving $10,000 for everyone across the board they\u2019re essentially just clearing interest. The total debt forgiven was money that technically never existed, so there was no corresponding tax hike.\n\nIt\u2019s like if I loaned you $100 and after accumulating some interest you owed me $150, but then I just said \u201cnah just pay me $110 and we\u2019re square\u201d. That $40 wasn\u2019t lost, it never existed in the first place.\n\nAll of this is to say, fuck anyone who claims to have a problem with student loan forgiveness",

If e.g. one of his role is to disregard the direct order in order to avoid excessive force which could endanger the person being arrested, then at which point and which case exactly should or should he not ? In this stressful situation he seems he's unable to take what appears to be the best decision here, which means he SHOULDNT have the responsability to take it.\n\nWe put responsability (life and death split-second decisions) in the hands of people which should have YEARS of training and ops experience to assume them. I would NEVER take that kind of responsability without actually being able to assume them, and these kids shouldn't either, and the government should not allow this to happen... If what they really want is to actually have a capable police force that is.",

My question is what do you see as \u201cthe issue\u201d you mentioned in your response when you say \u201c\u2026. We can\u2019t have rational discussion about THE ISSUE.\u201d You don\u2019t seem to define it or actually think there is one. So I\u2019d like to hear you put it into actual words.\n\nI\u2019d also love to hear how my criticism of plastering things with Blue Lives Matter stickers and the Republican Party actively using any criticism of police as an \u201cattack on traditional American values\u201d is the problem here in addressing that \u201cissue.\u201d It is exactly what I was criticizing: a lack of accountability & a political machine making even acknowledging accountability as a destruction of values that makes any \u201crational discussion of the issue\u201d impossible.\n\nI\u2019d also like to hear what you found \u201cso vitriolic\u201d about my original comment?\n\nAnd your commentary on a handful of good examples is meaningless on the larger scale and to people who don\u2019t live in those communities. Take NYC for example\u2026 the community I live in. There was criticism about lack of transparency and accountability for the NYPD. The response was for the NYPD to do everything they could to stop doing their job out in the community, but still file the police report on crime as much as possible. The result: first a nonstop media barrage about \u201cNYC crime statistics skyrocketing!\u201d And then a cop mayor who will increase their budget and require 0 changes to accountability. Police in the US can have their cake and eat it too. They only have to weather very brief moments of criticism, band together, and wait for it to pass without making changes. And it\u2019s bolstered by the \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d/let\u2019s worship police no matter what (with the exception of when they try to stop us of from storming the capitol) hardline The right wing has.\n\nAnd I say this as someone who has known multiple NYPD officers their entire lives\u2026 the ones who didn\u2019t get lost in their profession have described being in the NYPD as a pseudo militaristic culture of Us vs them, where protecting your partner (not just from danger but from any accountability) is seen as paramount. And this all doesn\u2019t take into account that NYC has the most police per capita of any city in the country & outspends small nations on policing.",

If the person backs off, then they can\u2019t effectively record the scene anymore, but if they stay in place they can be arrested themselves. It\u2019s also illegal to record \u2018private\u2019 conversations in AZ without at least one party consenting to it, so it gives the courts a lot of grey areas they can use to convict people (that also means you can\u2019t always hide behind a corner and film if you are within earshot, unless it\u2019s an obviously public place).",

A civil case you are trying to claim money, so if you are offered the money you are looking for and refuse courts tend to take a dim view. \n\nCriminal cases are about demanding punishment (and depending on the country private citizens cannot even bring)",

Shimanek tells Tomer to spray Puente, and Tomer starts spraying him in the face. He takes Puente\u2019s sunglasses off and sprays him again in the eyes.\n\nDude is subdued and in cuffs, but we need to make sure to spray his eyes with pepper spray several times. Totally not assault to purposesly cause harm to someone that's been subdued and in my custody though...  Can I go tie someone up and pepper spray their face a couple of times and only risk a Class A misdemeanor too?",

Since when is apathy towards the plight of one's fellow man considered a virtue?  \n\nI mean Daniel Shaver was pretty white if I remember and what happened to him was just straight up sickening. \n\nIf your reaction to watching a drunk man being forced to play a fucked up game of Simon Says at gunpoint while he sobs and begs for his life is to turn the other way and say \"that's not my problem\", then you are an incredibly fucked up person. It's fucked up, but it's understandable considering that people have a tendency to turn away from tragedy in order to avoid becoming overwhelmed. But to then go and use that trauma that was suffered by a man you don't give a damn about to try and diminish the trauma suffered by others like him is just downright disgusting to me. \n\nEveryone should be against police brutality, regardless of race, because it has the potential to affect any of us.",

The driver (son of the guy who was peppersprayed) was in a black Honda with tinted windows. The cop probably targeted him for being in a car that looked like it belonged to a young person or was looking to make a DUI arrest.\n\nI used to drive a blacked out 2-door sporty import with black rims. Some cops seem to hate that style. I got pulled over by the same motorcycle cop twice in a week. Another time by highway patrol and given a field sobriety test because it was a weekend night and he was fishing for a DUI. Dude \"smelled alcohol\", administers the field sobriety test on the sloped embankment full of mower tire ruts, and then when I pass he tries to get me tell him I'd drank and \"don't worry about my mic, its broken\".",

It can disqualify you from working for places that do work with the government - even if you aren't doing work for the government. My first job out of college at an engineering firm I had an exhaustive background check done on me - even though my division's clients were chemical factories, refineries, food processing plants - other divisions of the company did work for the federal government, but ALL employees company wide had the same standard background check. A colleague told me it was a nightmare for him when he got hired because he'd been arrested in college when police thought he'd done something wrong (he had a solid alibi that he was at work at the time), and the only reason he got hired when the arrest showed up was because he was good friends with and had worked for years perviously with the hiring manager.

But I think this is a chance for a quality LPT. \n\nFirst, bear in mind that law enforcement officers must be on guard even with minor traffic stops. The best way to deescalate the encounter, and make the LEO feel comfortable, is to do the following. (1) Turn the vehicle off, (2) roll down your window, (3) rest your left arm on the door with your *left* hand in the 10 o'clock position on the steering wheel AND rest your *right* hand on the steering wheel in the 12 o'clock position - so the officer can clearly see both your hands while approaching, (4) when asked for license and insurance, tell them where it's located and ask if it's ok to reach for it.\n\nThere are a lot of asshole cops out there but there are tons of ignorant citizens contributing to their fear by failing to do their part  keeping the encounter civil. When humans are in a constant state of fear, it often manifests itself as anger. Do you part to make an LEO feel at ease and 9 times out of 10 the interaction will go much more smoothly.\n\nEdit: Since everyone seems offended by my life pro tip, let me add that it'll also help you get away with breaking the law (perhaps you have contraband or you had a beer with dinner). I went to jail a few times as a teen and then I figured out the game and clocked law enforcement. Now I can drive down the road doing blow off the dashboard with a dead body in the trunk and they don't look my way. I gave y'all step one in the equation. I'm happy to provide other rules of the game, but I assure you this isn't about boot licking.",

It\u2019s like they hire any moron to do this shit without properly testing them to see if they are even a good human.",

People who they think will not or cannot fight back are who they go after because it's 'easy brownie points' and keeps their conviction target rates up.\n\nI was threatened by the Police who told me to Plead 'Guilty' and get a fine or if I chose to fight it and take it to court I would be facing a jail sentence. I can see how a lot of people would plead guilty to something they did not do under the threat of prison.\n\nI stuck to my guns and followed friends, family and my Barristers advice, and fought back. Would you believe that, even though the prosecution forensics came back with no evidence along with my defence forensics expert, they STILL pursued a conviction!\n\nI am guessing they were now desperate to try and save face, as after about a year and several court hearings, where even the residing Judge was querying why they were persisting when there was no evidence, and several times advised they drop the case, the CPS offered me a plea bargain: \"Admit to half the offences, and we will drop the other half!\"\n\nNeedless to say, I told them where to stick their plea offer, but I was so very tired of it all by now and was tempted to just give up. Thank god I did not let the bastards grind me down.\n\nIn the end it went to trial to the disbelief  of all concerned, and just as the trial jury were called into court, they dropped all charges and offered no evidence. The jury was dismissed, and I was allowed to leave, but the judge told the prosecution to remain behind.\n\nMy barrister told me when he finally emerged that the judge tore the prosecution a new arsehole and told them they were a disgrace and had cost the tax payer thousands of pounds bringing a non-starter case to court!",

When the parents asked to see the body cam footage, a different officer (who happens to be from the video in this post) told them:\n\n>Shimanek told H.W.\u2019s father he had reviewed the video and it might be hard for H.W.\u2019s parents to watch due to Wheeler\u2019s use of force against their son, the suit says. Shimanek told H.W.\u2019s father that he believed nothing about the use of force was inappropriate.\n\nOnce the parents found out about this officer's history and didn't trust his opinions on what is considered \"appropriate\" the body cam footage disappeared before they could see it.  And although there was an internal investigation performed, no review of body cam footage was included in the investigation records.\n\nBut at least that department demoted the officer from the original video.  He later resigned and was charged with \"official oppression\" (only a class A misdemeanor) as of May of last year, but that was the last update I could find.  No clue if he was convicted or fined (up to $4,000) or faced any jail time (up to one year).",

But claiming all cops are the same is BS and deep down if you have any ability to think for yourself, you know it.  Just because you don't see good cops behaving professionally on the news doesn't mean they don't exist, it means it's not news.  \n  \nAs soon as you start talking about how it takes more training to become a barber than a cop, you are just puppeting what you have been told. Maybe you don't even know that comment is based on flat out manuplation of data calling academy graduation the end of an officers training. That gets put out there by people with the full knowledge it is false, but count of the fact you won't question or double check the info before you spread it around. \n  \nThose hours are academy hours, there is still 16-20 weeks of 1 on 1 training for the officer including weekly evaluations and an oral board to pass before he's ever allowed to work on his own.\n  \nYou quickly claim more misinformation, just like you were trained to do. High IQs that are willing to work in LE find themselves being recruited to federal level LE or government careers.  They generally hold multiple degrees and are actively sought out to fill specific positions. \n  \nAny officer posted to top-level assignments such as Robbery Homicide, Intelligence, Computer Crimes and more will be one of the best trained, focused, and experienced individuals qualified to do the job. \n  \n  IQ doesn't even translate into the real world on it's own. Intelligence level only goes so far. People with higher IQs statistically focus on academia to the point where many social skills like the ability to recognize body language, verbal cues, and other interpersonal skills didn't get the same attention. Those are important skills to have in that line of work.\n  \nGo talk to some students at Cal Tech, they will have exceptional, math, science, STEM, and even writing skills. Not all, but many with those real nigh IQs lack the ability to come down and meet a person at their mental and phycological level. They don't come across as approachable or understanding to your standard member of the public. \n  \nA huge factor that gets overlooked, the job doesn't pay enough to entice people who could put that high IQ to better use somewhere they could earn more money with less risk.\n\nI doubt any of this will get through, at least it has all been put out there so you can finally choose for yourself. Or you just go back to manipulating facts till they say what you need",

Seriously, that was his reason: He cheated on his wife with prostitutes and gave his wife herpes because his coworkers called him the f-word. By all accounts he was a decent guy who got into law enforcement for altruistic reasons, but within a year he was just as sleazy and corrupt as everyone else. They will haze and harass rookies into leaving or being corrupt. There's no third option.",

Ive never seen a group of people so willing to ruin lives because they feel disrespected\u2026.as if any citizen in the country has ANY duty to respect a police officer.

In my country too, a lot of people who join the police force are macho guys, powertrippers sometimes too or just people who don't have a degree and the police offers a career.   \nHowever we try to counteract that by having psychological tests before anyone can join, de-escalation training, and other kinds of trainings aimed at filtering these personalities and trying to educate them where they need to be.   \nAnd then there's also just the fact we don't have firearms, so things rarely escalate that far, most police agents here will never have to draw their weapon in their entire life.   \nWhile we also certainly have our issues within the police, i'd say in general i trust them with my wellbeing.   \n\n\nSo i guess there's a few different factors at play, whether it's the perception society has of the police force and what its role is, to the tests and trainings required, to general culture and violence. I'm not American so i can't say. I just hope you guys can find a way.",

There are tons of examples of shitty cop interaction with citizens and guests, but the rules of travel are similar to any other country; major cities you'll tend to be unmolested by cops, moreso criminals. Stay out of poor locations.  Remote areas are more of a crapshoot; stay on major highways and avoid giving a reason for a police interaction. You can travel around the US pretty safely if you stick to reasonably populated areas, even if they in remote areas, like national parks accessed by major highways. This is similar information given to tourists in China, Bulgaria, Spain, Costa Rica, Brazil, Mexco, etc. If you want to roll the dice, head down to the projects in Baltimore or a remote small town in some Southern State with one cop.

So that's how they behave.   \n\nTo be honest, they don't just need better training. They need ongoing re-enforcement of social and ethical norms. This is a complicated problem.  \n\nCops are what Kohlberg called [conventional morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development#Conventional) types. Trouble is their ideas of social consensus and social standards are dramatically skewed by what they see every day.

      "text": "TL;DR - the officer was demoted twice, charged with misdemeanor oppression, then resigned. The officer who did the pepper spraying was let off the hook, despite refusing to provide medical attention and deliberately extending the father\u2019s pain and suffering. The father was awarded $200k, paid by tax payers with the city paying $5k and TML paying $195k. The son was arrested for making a wide turn and had to pay his fine to leave jail, even though it is not a jail able offense.\n\nSo here\u2019s what\u2019s happened:\n\n- in August 2020 kid arrested for a wide turn. Had to pay fine to leave jail. Keller Sgt. Blake Shimanek initiated the aggressive police stop. What\u2019s strange is taking a wide turn is a fine only citation, and questions why he was cuffed and taken to jail for a crime that statutorily has no jail time as a a punishment. By arresting him and taking him to jail, it is excessive punishment than the legislature intended.\n\n- father was denied medical attention for 20 minutes after being pepper sprayed. Blake Shimanek refused to allow other officers to towel off the pepper spray, waited to call in medics. Medics arrived 20 minutes later and started providing aid. The father sued, won $200k for the 20 minutes of pain and suffering. The city settled in February 2021, which is insanely fast for a city payout. The father likely could have gotten much more in a jury payout.\n\n- a white witness was standing on the other side, closer than the father recording. The officers Blake Shimanek and Ankit Tomer threatened the white witness but did not assault them or arrest the white witness. \n\n- the initial officer, sgt Blake Shimanek was demoted from sergeant but NOT fired.\n\n- Shimanek and Tomer both lied to commanding officers and in their police report. Shimanek made at least 5 material lies to commanding officer hope and 3 times to Lt Berry. These lies were used to justify an unlawful search of the sons car to find narcotics. No narcotics were found.\n\n- in December 2021, a year after this happened, Blake Shimanek, was charged with official oppression a misdemeanor. He resigned, and was NOT fired.\n\n- the officer who did the pepper spraying, Ankit Tomer, was found to have done no wrong with the defense of following orders from his superior officer Blake Shimanek. Department found the junior officer neglected to perform any medical attention after unlawfully battering the father, but that wasn\u2019t enough to reprimand the junior officer. They also found he was unprofessional by making fun of the father, while the father is handcuffed and in extreme pain, saying things like, he had failed as a father and how does it feel to have your son watch you cry like a bitch? This also was not enough to reprimand the junior officer. The junior officer appears to have been at least verbally reprimanded for calling medics against the orders of Shimanek. Shimanek told Tomer to take the father to jail, and provide medical treatment (wiping off the pepper spray) there, even when medics were on the way to the scene, thus extending the victims pain and suffering, which was acknowledged cruelly by both officer Shimanek and Tomer. On the way to jail with the father, Tomer stopped randomly to extend the time before the father got medical aid.\n\n- Shimanek complained about the burning from pepper spray he GOT ON HIMSELF spraying the father, instead of providing any aid to the father. \n\n- the father repeatedly asked for medical help as he could not breathe, see, was on fire, and was panicking. He said he was suffocating on his own snot and having an asthma attack. Instead of helping the officers unlawfully searched the father and his truck.\n\n- at the jail, the father was left in the patrol car for 7 minutes, then unlawfully, and without justification put in a restraint chair. \n\n- once medics arrived, an officer on scene, who had been there watching the entire time, listening to the father wail and scream for help, provided aid, rather than a medic.\n\n- two days later the chief apologized and dropped charges. He said he watched the video and the officers messed up and the father should have been arrested or pepper sprayed. Chief said the father did nothing wrong and did as directed.\n\n- father was told there was no record or body cam. This contradicts the chief saying he watched it. The department found it when the father got a lawyer involved.\n\n- the city mayor claims the city only paid a $5k deductible and insurance paid the rest. This is misleading because it makes it seem like taxpayers were not responsible for paying for the cluster fuck. Texas Municipal League (TML) paid the other $195k. TML is a way for Texas municipalities to self insure through a shared risk pool. TML is funded by Texas tax payers and backed by Texas state government property as collateral. Texas taxpayers still paid the $200k.",

Cop stops an unjust arrest. \n\nSo you drug up 6 videos, and the closest thing you got to a cop actually stopping police misconduct was an officer telling his colleague to stop punching a pinned suspect in the head. Thank you for proving my point.",

True he didn't prevent the violence but he showed his strong disapproval.  But sure I'll accept this is the weakest one.~~\n\n>~~in all of these videos there\u2019s never a good cop preventing this? Where are they?~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Find me a video, any video, where a cop in America restrains another cop. I\u2019ll wait.\n\nAgain, except for the 2nd video every one of these videos shows cops preventing either violence or over-aggressive tactics.  I feel like that fits this request.  Of course, I guess it depends on what your definition of \"restrains\" is.  Maybe you just mean violence but you didn't specify. On the other hand if you are even questioning if video #1 is a good example of this then I know you're not acting in good faith in this discussion.  You had one cop wailing on a handcuffed suspect on the ground and the other cop physically intervened to stop him.  I don't know what more you want.  You did say \"fair play\" at the end so I'll take that as you accepting it.\n\nSo you asked for just 1 example and I gave you 2 (1st and last) by your own admission. I'd also point out that it literally took me 1 minute to find these with a simple youtube search of the terms \"good cop\".  Took me another 15 to scan through them to make sure they were relevant and create the post.  I'm sure there are many more out there. And I am sure there are many more in the real world that don't get recorded or posted anywhere.\n\nDon't get me wrong, though, videos like the subject of this post make my blood boil too and I do think we have a cop training/screening issue in this country.  But there are literally millions of cop interactions every day in this country and they don't all end like this.",

Second, OP claimed nobody could find even 1.  I proved him wrong.  And I'm sure I could find a lot more if I felt like spending the time on it but I don't.  He asked for 1 and I gave him six.  Y'all can do your own research on that.\n\nBut sure, there are a lot more videos of cops acting badly.  There's just much more of a market for that over \"cops doing the right thing.\"  But it's absurd to think that every cop/public interaction of the millions that occur every day ends in cops acting horribly.  Sure there are plenty of bad ones and I think something needs to be done about it.  But the vast majority of interactions are basically neutral, non-violent and fair.",

One was beating a handcuffed suspect on the ground.  The other was chasing a suspect around and firing a taser at him multiple times. If you can't see that then you are not arguing in good faith.\n\nEdit:\n\n>If this is really the best examples\n\nI never claimed these are the best examples or even close to all of them.

You're under the impression that the person asking for proof wants to know more rather than just wants people who make claims to be obligated to provide proof. Wanting someone to provide evidence is not the same as wanting to research. \n\nSimilarly, if someone claims the Earth is flat, it's not the readers responsibility to research the subject and then disprove them, and likely most people have no interest in doing so. But saying, \"Prove it,\" is a reasonable expectation. Expecting others to research every claim they read to verify it is unreasonable.\n\nAgain, to stress, I'm not interested in the topic at hand, just the general attitude people seem to have towards who is responsible for proof. You claim it's easy for people to just look something up, and you're right, but you can just as easily apply the same logic to the original claimant. It's just as easy for them to just post evidence and would be more beneficial if they did in the first place.",

Cops don't only do one thing.  Sure, there is A LOT of corruption going on. But calling all cops terrible is just plain idiotic because it is simply not true.

He clearly had no weapon, he made no violent or threatening movements, so he very simply could have talking to the dude.. he could have done so many other things besides becoming aggressive, & the pepper spray was complete overkill.. the cops- pleural, we\u2019re both on top of him, cuffs half on & then he started spraying.. cuffs then all the way on & he go in again, MAKING SURE TO GET IT DIRECTLY IN THE FACE WHEN HE WAS ALREADY DETAINED. Right is right & wrong is wrong. Police think they need to act like military in that they have to listen to their superior. Let\u2019s say a manager of a bar told the employee they manage to refuse service to someone just standing there, they would/should say something. At the least the 2nd cop could have asked more questions to understand the situation.. \nI mean on one hand we could say the 2nd cop \u2018wAS jUsT dOinG HiS jOb\u2019 because  his supervisor told him to & sadly that is the culture of cops -\u2018do as your supervisor says\u2019 so that\u2019s understandable that he followed a commanding officer. But it shouldn\u2019t be like that.. once the dad was on the ground with TWO cops on his back, the pepper spray became excessive force \nThe arriving cop had a few opportunities to get an understanding of the situation, & the first cop didn\u2019t need to come barreling towards the dad to say the phone out of his hand.",

I make a effort to be respectful to cops b/c Ik they can ruin my life and may be having a bad day. In other words I talk like a slave traveling with a pass from their owner... but This chump called two other cops and made me take a full sobriety test on cold wisconsin night in February. On top of that they said they had the right to search my car b/c I locked the car when I got out for the sobriety test(I was young and didn't know the law)... this is why we say black people have freedom but don't have liberty like white folks.

I'm a commercial diver it has a higher rate of death compared to police. The first option is the best route but the second option has merit.",

Another showed up at my house once and grilled me about someone who doesn't even live here because he didn't have the exact address and was just \"checking.\" I was caught up in a road rage incident where the driver of the truck following me actually lost their canopy when some wind kicked up and lifted it off. I ducked down a side road and got away for long enough to call the cops and let them know. They told me no one was in the area and it would be a while before they could get to me. The broken canopy laid there on a major road for 3 days before it was finally cleaned up and I heard later that it was a neighbor who was sick of driving around it",

There's a thing called \"ballistic needling\" that everyone who carries OC spray is trained on. You can VERY easily cause permanent damage to someone's eyes if you deploy OC on them from anything closer than 3-4 feet depending on the brand. This fucking clown was less than 6 inches away and gave more than one shot. \n\nThere are probably situations where this is justified from officers, without a doubt, but given the impact factors present in this video that cop was so far out of his bounds and needs to get throated for that.",

But, for whatever reason, this is the one that made me finally just have to post something on the internet to vent my frustration. This made my blood boil. The absolute ARROGANCE and disregard for peace and the COMPLETE lack of empathy for another human\u2019s experience is just\u2026 fuck. There aren\u2019t words. Protect and serve?!?!?! This kid was scared from the start and the cop turns that into a reality by doing the exact shit that the kid is so afraid might happen. That for no reason everything can turn south and that simply BEING will be \u201creasonable cause\u201d. So \u201cacting suspicious\u201d (which looks a LOT like being scared and not knowing how to act) is literally reasonable cause for property search and handcuffs. FUCK!\n\nThe scariest thing is how ABSOLUTELY AFRAID this piece of shit with authority and a gun was the whole video. The entire event was predicated on this man\u2019s need to seek out a position of power and authority over others because he has been a scared piece of shit his whole life and decided he needed a gun and a badge to fix it. And he blames this kid for being acting weird around him\u2026 well it\u2019s fuckin\u2019 scary. \n\nThe Power of One. This reminds me of that movie. Morgan Freeman tells the apartheid guard, who is violently demanding it, the real meaning of the lyrics of the song being sung by the black prisoners at that moment a ways off in the background - which were actually written in protest and mistranslated to the authorities to hide that they are a description of the guards themselves; including this most violent man. The prisoners sing on as Freeman\u2019s character translates, with defiance, through bloodied lips: \u201cThey run this way they run that way. They are scared. They are afraid.\u201d He knows exactly what the response will be.  The guard, enraged by the audacity of the accusation that they are afraid of their own prisoners or anything at all, proceeds to beat the malnourished, injured, and defenseless prisoner to death. \n\nThat\u2019s what I think about when I think about cops now. And it makes me afraid too.",

They both assume capitalism is the natural state of humanity, they both generally support austerity (although the level of austerity and where is often a point of bickering), they both generally support free markets, they both support a police state, and they often agree on foreign policy, especially when it comes to war and funding the military.\n\nLike, just look at liberals parties across the world.

I appreciate those who've been harmed being compensated, whether or not it's from my tax dollars.\n\nNobody has to go through anything to recieve a settlement. You make it sound like they were beaten just for a settlement. That's not what happened. Police brutality occurred, and the department was sued, and the victims compensated. Imo, that's great. Especially if you compare it to getting nothing, or a shitty amount. They paid out $200k, and both of those cops are no longer on the force. That's justice from an injustice imo.\n\nAs for welfare queens, fuck them. There's good people out there trying their hardest, and welfare fucks them over. Meanwhile, the people who lie and abuse the system get absolutely taken care of.\n\nSome examples. A girl in HS got $55 in Foodstamps for herself, and her parents. Myself, I got $120/mo($4/day to feed myself).\n\nMeanwhile, my (literal) crackhead uncle was fully taken care of. He had three kids, and a disabled wife. His excuse for not working was \"he took care of his wife\", when in reality he'd be smoking weed, popping pills, and playing video games. His wife actually had to relearn how to walk. The kids weren't taken care of, and had several instances of cops coming because they'd be outside in the road (youngest, 3yro, only in her diaper). The kids would come to my house to get fed.\n\nSo yeah, fuck welfare queens.",

I'm not the only one, everyone i know now teaches their kids to stay away from cops. That's messed up and it's not getting better. Everyone who thinks it's not that bad and all cops aren't like that, just give it time. Your time will come when you and your rights are willfully shit on and your checkbook is gonna take a hit. \nI wonder if some sort of legislation can be passed making the fines payed out for shit like this come from the actual union or station and not paid for by us? Wonder if that is possible. I hear defund the police and i dont want that, we need law enforcers, but if we stop paying the fines for all these wrongful lawsuits i guarantee the union will stop this behavior. \nWe need real cops who aren't so scared of a fistfight or scuffle that they just shoot and kill at every interaction. Cops who want to de-escalate and not have such weak pride they push for conflict knowing they have a gun and can kill freely. Cops who know and follow the laws and not work out ways that the \"loopholes\" let them abuse their power.",

There are some good police but they have a difficult job and they are often scared or callous. Many \"bad\" police are complicit in crimes and are now serving time or have been forced to resign. The police are not usually around when a crime is committed. Brutalization by policemen is done every minute somewhere. Now it doesn't matter the respective race of the parties. So what we need is a perfect government administration that will rid the world of evil-doers of all kinds and will educate adherents of the government in the ways of peace and love. Hopefully, the time for that government is near. READ Psalms 37: 9-11, 29. This government's King Jesus Christ and his 144,000 co-rulers (Rev. 14: 1-4) will not only bring peaceable conditions but everlasting life for all peoples (Rev 7:9) who will live on the earth without Adamic death (Psalms 37:9-11, 29). Yes, even our enemy death will be removed (Rev 21:1-4). Would you like to learn more about this \"perfect government\" and answer to other Bible questions? If so, confidentially and privately go to jw.org",

      "text": "Well\u2026 this crap does not only happen to black people.. a dumb cop is a dumb cop to anybody. I just feel sorry for the cops seeing this\u2026 I mean, of course the boy and father were treated really badly but according to multiple comments here, they got a payout so it\u2019s \u201cok\u201d. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a \u201cfair\u201d outcome instead. \n\nBut my point is, it\u2019s sad for the cops as a group. Two stupid asswipes doing their jobs so badly are affecting the image of thousands who are doing a great job. Their duty is help and protect, not abuse and harass\u2026 I don\u2019t have the real statistics of course but I don\u2019t think I am that far off if I say probably 99% of the cops are good folks with a family and friends who are trying to do their job the best they can and be fair with people. \n\nThe 1% is just either pure dumbass or people in a bad period in their life running around with a badge and authority.  Sometimes, no matter how good you are, a bad day can happen and your judgment could be failing. \n\nAlso, that\u2019s a hell of a job if you ask me. Most people who are bitching at cops would never do that job themselves. \n\nSo, thanks to all the cops out there who are working their ass to protect the community and help people. \n\nFuck those who are acting like the two in this video. If you\u2019re one of them and reading this, maybe it\u2019s time to consider another career. Maybe something you\u2019ll be happy doing. Deep down, you\u2019re a good person who used to be a toddler playing with it\u2019s toys and never expected to be someone like that. Try to make your kid heart back and be kind to others. This job might just not be meant for and that\u2019s totally fine!",

If when they are on duty they cannot tell you which law you have violated down to the number and then recite the basics of said law, they will not be considered as making a legal arrest. If they try to make an arrest without being able to these two very basic things. Then the citizen they are confronting can legally defend their person with as much force as they feel is needed to end the dangerous situation. This will solve many problems.",

Then made him watch while two Officers physically assaulted his father, who was also being cuffed for no reason, and pepper spray him after he stopped resisting said, unprovoked, assault. He was face down on the ground with someone on top of him putting the other handcuff on before the spray was administered.

Let me tell you, even with a basic understanding of what happened here I am so very blown away at what went down.  I would be fucked six different ways for a quarter of what these two did. Also, as a white guy, I am embarrassed and upset that this seems racist, ignorant, an abuse of power, and straight up assault.\n\nAny cops watching this shit, this is why people are afraid of you. \n\nAny racist pieces of shit reading this shit, fuck you.

That means seizing some \"cherry\" or other (the window, for example, or the truck \"blocking traffic\", then the guy who *had been* \"blocking traffic\" now standing on the sidewalk LOL) according to a motivation. \n\nUsually the motivation in cherry picking is desire to acquire, but it can also be fear. The cop appears to be rather fearful, as if he'd been watching a lot of \"arrestees shooting cops\" videos, perhaps because he'd had a bad recent arrest attack by an arrestee, etc. But it can also be a desire-based cherry picking, the desire being to exert power/feel superior/control, etc. In any case, the \"protein spikes\" of this operation is the effective cause: the cherry picking.\n\nCherry picking. Get to know what it is. How it works. It's coming for you and may even grow in you if you're not careful.",

Everyone wants there to be higher standards, more/better training, insurance requirements, etc for police (which there should be) but nobody wants to raise taxes and pay them more to attract better people/quality candidates. There is that old saying you get what you pay for and that applies to cops as well. If you increase standards and requirements you also need to increase pay or nobody is going to want to do it who\u2019s worth a crap. You\u2019re only going to attract people who want the job for the power it comes with. Nobody wants to go through massive amounts of training and have to pay for/carry insurance for a job that involves long hours, high stress, and abysmal pay. Most cops in America make under or around 30k annually, many less than that in rural areas. Where I live they make around 28k annually. We want to hold the profession to the same kind of standards as doctors and nurses but also don\u2019t want to raise taxes or pay them shit. \n\nBecause it\u2019s socially popular to say that cops should have to undergo more training and be held to higher standards we all support that, demand it, and repeat it like parrots. But because it\u2019s socially unpopular to say cops should be paid more nobody will dare say that or demand it, even though that\u2019s really the only way to attract higher quality candidates and be able to implement these reforms and standards we all want.",

All these videos keep getting more and more ridiculous to the point of being satirical. I really hate to bring up the movie Idiocracy, because it's pretty much low-hanging fruit, but almost every cop I see these days reminds me of this guy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Poq5a\\_8yQnU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Poq5a_8yQnU)\n\nAnyway, that's all to say, with this ridiculous state of affairs we find ourselves in, I really don't think it's out of the realm of possibility that scenarios like cop/citizen/use-of-force scams could be in play. I mean, think about it; a lot of people would be willing to take a shot or two of pepper spray to the face to get $100k, cop gets a slap on the wrist, if even that, then everyone moves on with no victims involved... except for the American Taxpayer, of course.

Most cops in the USA are not encouraged, much less trained, to deescalate.

Was completely sober, and got arrested for trying to help the bar manager(who also tried defending me)prevent an altercation. When I tried to explain this to the police officer, he smacked my phone into my face which busted my nose(was holding my phone not recording or anything), then he twisted my arm and tried to slam my face on the bar top. When I gave a slight resistance to avoid having my teeth smashed on the bar, that\u2019s when they started the whole \u201cstop resisting\u201d thing and then slammed me on the bar floor and pinned my head and shoulders with their knees. They took me to jail, no breathalyzer, no blood test, nothing. They then claimed I was resisting arrest and was belligerent and heavily intoxicated. I now have a court date for this September, to fight that charge. Luckily the bar owner and bar manager already have the video footage ready to protect me, along with the bar receipts that show I had not only just arrived, but only ordered a beer 30 seconds or so prior to the whole ordeal. I have teeth knocked loose, had stitches in my mouth, and still have a black eye. Police need to stop being allowed to have these power trips and no accountability. Sad part is, worst thing that\u2019s going to happen is these guys charges will probably just get dropped, no skin off the cops back!",

A cop pulls up beside me and signals to me to stop and I thought it was the music being too loud, so I roll down my window and say sorry and I'll turn it down and then roll it back up. He signals to me again and I roll it back down and he says I'm not legally allowed to talk on the phone like that and drive. I say sorry again and he drives off at the green light.

This PO asking this dude why's he's nervous is ridiculous. Also, seems like PO is one of those that likes going off on power trips. Not a good quality for a police officer, and de-escalation is something that is actively taught in most academies. This guy did the opposite.\n\nThe right of citizens to record the police in public has been so firmly established by the courts that at this point there should be no police officer in the country that is not aware of this. This is a gross violation of a person's constitutional rights.\n\n[I recently read an article that most European countries require 3 years](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.798067/full) (not the original article I read, but it makes the point) of training before a person can be considered a police officer: year 1, they learn all of the theory, year 2, how to apply it, and year 3 covers actual practice. How long do police academies last in this country before we hand people a badge and a gun when most of them have no clue what the constitution even is?\n\nNote: I have a lot of law enforcement in my family (one is a police chief in a town in NJ) and I don't want this to be interpreted as being anti-police. **Wanting police to do their jobs properly AND supporting the police are not mutually exclusive concepts.** Two seemingly contradicting ideas can both be true at the same time.\n\n\u201cThe test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function.\" F. Scott Fitzgerald\n\n[\"The statement credited police chief Brad Fortune with acting quickly in \"addressing the issues\" in the case, but added, 'it is disappointing that these officers are still employed at the Keller Police Department.'\"](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/keller-to-pay-200k-to-man-pepper-sprayed-by-police-after-he-videotaped-sons-traffic-stop-lawyer-says/2534006/)\n\nThe fact that a police officer can do something like this and not lose their job is a major part of the problem. The other is training.",

I saw so much of this and worse growing up in the 60s and early 70s. And nobody would believe it. I\u2019m glad everybody now has a video camera in their pocket. Still, there are some cops who even though they know they\u2019re being recorded, just don\u2019t get how wrong this is, particularly for someone in a position of such power\n\nEdit: I just read the article. I\u2019m glad one of the cops got punished, but I never see anything about police training programs put in place to try to prevent this before it happens. This cop acted like he could do it with impunity. Perhaps if the department had a zero tolerance policy and the officers knew they were serious about it, it might not have happened\n\nThen again, it was in Texas\n\nEdit 2: The victim\u2019s name was Marco Puente. perhaps he wasn\u2019t white after all (whatever \u201cwhite\u201d means; I\u2019m not sure \u2014 there are plenty of Hispanics whiter than me \u2014 not that it should even be a consideration, but sadly it is)",

Yes, I am implying the officer was viewing the guy's behavior as threatening because rolling up his window in both instances did not add up as routine. Something of which I would still say in both scenario and reality that they came in heated and escalated everything. But all the same, I can understand how the idiot went on to be aggressive \"protecting and serving\" the community.",

Like, the driver probably was all, \u201coh fuck cops coming gotta roll down the window, wait window is already down, *derps* roll it up, fuck, wait that\u2019s not correct, better roll it back down.\u201d Kinda fits with the \u201cget out of the car command.\u201d My first instinct when getting out of a car is to make sure to roll the windows up. Bloody hell do cops need a serious dose of fucking reality and perspective. Now, I know traffic stops can quickly become a dangerous situation for cops and civilians within in seconds, but that\u2019s the job cops signed up for. If you\u2019re *that* worried about your own personal safety that you\u2019re willing to fuck with civilians because they *might* be a threat, then you\u2019re in the wrong profession. Maybe it should be encouraged that cops don\u2019t have families or romantic relationships. Cops should be more akin to warrior monks than scared bitch babies. Violence and detainment should be an absolute last resort, only after violence has been perpetrated against them, and even then, with complete restraint on the cops part. Cops should be of the highest caliber of mentally disciplined and physically training people, willing to die before escalating a situation past the bare minimum required to maintain peace. They have a moral directive to SERVE AND PROTECT OTHERS. Something I rarely see in cops today.",

The first guy seemed to cooperate, at least from a civilian (and non american) point of view.\n\nThe second one didn't cooperate so much because he tried to reason with the officer at the sight of an unreasonable order. I think american people start losing their reason when they simply insist to resist orders from police. But nevermind, these cops can't talk their way out of it, and things, apparently, usually end up with people being tossed to the ground, tased and sprayed.\n\nI also get it though that, if you are pattroling and someone starts riding up a tinted window on you, it might look suspicious, and can even be dangerous since you lose sight of what happens inside the car. My facepalm would go to the way they let it escalate so quickly over a phone.",

Ive got a better chance of being shot at work then i do being shot by a cop. Does stop that fear from being in your head when uou get pulled over but same thing in reverse.\n\nTake the i believe it was a virginia troopr i could ve wrong on that part but there was a officer just responding to a convenience  store theft think it wasjust a ba of chips or somthing. He gets there stops a guy fitting the description  as soon as he gets in arms reach man pulls a gun and literallt unloads it into the officer. Or the guy who in a traffic stop who gets out unloading multiple weapons at the officer hopped up on drugs was shot somthing like 20 times and didnt go down. Weather yoy think it could happen or not percentages dont matter doesnt mea you give into fear and letit control you but itsnonly human to have some form of reaction to situations. And these people are trained to not run from it so they get angry and annoyed.\n\n Doesnt make poor decisions  right but in the heat of a momeby judgment gets clouded",

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the dude\u2019s fault for rolling up his window. Honestly, he was probably just on autopilot bc that\u2019s what he always does when he gets out of his car. However, I also understand the cops reaction because some people who are asked to get out of their cars don\u2019t want to because they have illegal weapons on them and are willing to use them on police to get away.  If the cop pulled him over just for rolling up his window like he says at the beginning of the video, that\u2019s bad policing.  But being extra cautious while asking him to get out of his car is completely understandable. I should also mention that we don\u2019t have the full story. Perhaps something more occurred that we don\u2019t see if the video.  As an observer I want both people to be safe and treated fairly. I\u2019m not taking sides.  Just pointing out that the cops reaction to him rolling up his window wasn\u2019t totally wrong.  Please continue being ignorant and calling people stupid if it makes you feel better about your life. I wish you the best with you ex and kids.  That\u2019s not an easy situation.",

I\u2019ve been harassed by cops before (in a very similar way as in the video actually) and yet I still empathize with the difficulty of their job. For every video there is of a cop being bad, there is a video of a cop being good.  And for every video there is of a cop being good, there is a video of a cop being shot dead during a routine traffic stop.  The more people hate on police, the less desirable the job becomes.  If it becomes too undesirable, tax payers (you, me, and everyone else) will have to pay more for shittier cops, which only perpetuates the problem. Perhaps this is why I feel the need to defend them in this echo chamber of hate.  These cops do need to be reprimanded for their actions, but I also understand that fear can cause people to make bad choices. Cops need better vetting and training, not hate from the public.  They are people too.  Perhaps this cop was going through a similar situation as you?  It doesn\u2019t justify it, but I\u2019d understand it better just like I now understand you better.",

The problem comes back to the cops escalated into pepper spraying a man recording and arresting a man protecting his property by rolling up a window. Idk about you, I've been shot at. And I know for fuck sure, if im scared of being shot, I dont go for pepper spray, nor walk away from the man im afraid of being shot by. These cops were on one. Number two im not even 100% sure thought they needed to spray. But number one just did it. He didn't fear for his life, didn't even act close to it. And number two got brought for a wild ride of stupidity and by the time he could say anything it was too late. So even arguably he's not even to blame. I apologize for my initial insult, the problem arises if he feared for his life, why didn't he act like it?",

That man was not acting threatening, he was complying, there was no reason to arrest him let alone point a gun at his face or arrest his father for standing in the side walk. It's cops acting like this that gives them all a bad reputation. I'm a lawyer. I'm a law abiding citizen.

This is instead the ignorance of people making assumptions based on presentation",

It\u2019s pretty few and far between that there are cut and dry cases of complete wrongdoing by an officer from start to finish AND the civilian so clearly in the right. It\u2019s so one sided at this point it just seems rare to me\u2026 anyhow, you\u2019re in a position of power in the long run, you\u2019ll have the footage to back you up and any lawyer worth their salt can easily get this tossed out. You have to keep your cool and trust it\u2019ll get sorted in the long run bc that cop is an a-hole and he\u2019s going to make your day and possibly your life as difficult as he can and he\u2019s got some effective ways of doing so. Just comply and keep your mouth closed.. let him be an a-hole and redeem yourself in the end. The moment you start resisting he\u2019s now in the right and you\u2019re just a combatant who has proved him right. That\u2019s how it\u2019s viewed in the eyes of the law. My dad got pulled over once for running a light, except it was still green and the cop was coming from other direction and had just assumed I guess. Anyhow my dad is very respectful and very respected in his community\u2026 Coach, deacon of church, etc.. he\u2019s extremely nice and humble. This cop was early 20\u2019s and when my dad told him the light was still green the cop freaked and basically told him it was red bc he said it was red. He told my dad to watch his mouth and my dad said all he was thinking was \u201cI got kids older than you!\u201d Ha.  He said it dawned on him at that moment that he can get this sorted out on the court date, he stopped trying to plead his case and let the cop do his thing. He knew that cop can take things as far as he wants and my dad wasn\u2019t about that. It\u2019s super difficult but you have to keep your wits about you and live to fight another day. These dudes in the video seen like absolute victims of someone else\u2019s bad day.",
