  "text": "TIFU by helping a drunk girl get home okay.\n\nI (22F) I work at a hotel bar in a large city. I worked a particularly slow day and during those shifts I like to talk to the guests. One of them was a 22 year old teacher who was traveling by herself and a guest of the hotel. I get cut early and I decide to go out for a couple drinks. At a bar nearby, I see the guest - she is very clearly drunk and proceeds to throw up all over the bar. Now this part of town is kinda known for sleazy guys and she\u2019s by herself - so I take her back to the hotel and get her in her room safe before anyone can take advantage of her. I leave her my number to text me when she\u2019s awake to make sure she\u2019s okay and she thanks me the next morning and explains she was blackout drunk and barely remembers any of the night. I thought that was the end of it - until my boss pulled me into a room and proceeded to fire me for \u201cfraternizing with a guest\u201d. I explained that I only got her to her room safe and was worried because she was young and alone, but nope. I\u2019m officially unemployed now. For helping a drunk girl get back to her hotel okay.\n\nTL;DR - got fired for helping a drunk girl get back to her hotel room okay.\n\nEdit: for those asking for more information: I did take her in the closest entrance which was the employee entrance. I think this has a lot more to do with it. My boss is not a rapist and didn\u2019t slip her anything. And while I\u2019m thinking of naming them, I don\u2019t want to get at risk of going up against a large company. I\u2019m a broke 22 year old (and I am a girl, for all y\u2019all who thought I was a man) who was living paycheck to paycheck. I can\u2019t afford a lawyer. I did file for unemployment. I appreciate everyone\u2019s well wishes. \n\nTW: I actually had a very bad episode as a result of this and attempted. I\u2019m in the hospital now and will not have any way to update further for a while.\n\nEdit 2: thank you everyone, sincerely, for all the well wishes. I\u2019m back from the hospital and am staying with family until I\u2019m a little more stable. I appreciate everyone\u2019s kind words and support. I\u2019m unsure if anyone will see this since it\u2019s been some time, but I thought I\u2019d update.\n\nAfter much consideration, I\u2019ve decided to name the hotel: Viceroy Chicago. Whether or not you decide to stay there is entirely up to you. There are some wonderful people working there, but it seems they place liability above the mental or physical safety of their guests and employees. This is a passage from the email HR sent me:\n\n\u201cIn regards to your employment status with Viceroy Chicago, entering a hotel room with a guest, is in violation of Viceroy policy.  Colleagues are not allowed to stay at the property in which they work and Unauthorized entrance/access to any Viceroy space/facility, offices, guest rooms or computer information sources is conduct that Viceroy considers inappropriate and leads to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, which due to the severity of this infraction, we will terminate employment at this point.\u201c\n\nSo there you go. Do with this information whatever you wish. I understand their decision from a liability standpoint personally, but not from a moral or ethical standpoint. While I\u2019m the hospital I realized it was best I got out of there now anyway. I wish you all the best.",

About five minutes later, my salty bartender comes over saying: \u201cwe just got a bad review from a <my-first-name> on Google\u2026 was that you?\u201d\nSo I take responsibility and say yes I gave the three star review. She asks why. I tell her just like the review said, the food is great but the service is bad. I tell her I didn\u2019t have a drink for nearly ten minutes while she was talking to a friend at the other end of the bar about some side hustle she has going. Clearly upset, she tells me: \u201cwell.. some people come here to network!\u201d, turns on her heels and shuffles off. \n\nAt this point the stranger a few seats down from me wishes he had some popcorn. I just go back to my phone, and update the review from 3 to 1 star and explain the updated situation. \n\nThe next day I get a response from the owner that it won\u2019t happen again. I actually frequented this place for the next couple years and never saw this lady front of house again. However she did deliver my food from the kitchen a few times so I know she didn\u2019t quit..",

Yes, but to demand it is such an asshole Karen type move.\n\nI don't think anything else you said was out of line. I actually support most of it. I've left bad reviews for the same reason and it's justified here but your post makes it painfully obvious you've never worked in the service industry a day in your life. Shit happens. You happened to show up when they were out of rice. They were making more. They got busy and didn't anticipate the kitchen being backed up. Shit happens.",

Higher mileage means you\u2019d want those things done recently, or you\u2019d hope for a good deal on the vehicle since you\u2019d be forking out some money on the work in a relatively short time. \n\nBefore you put any money down toward a car, grab the VIN and check online for any recalls. If there are any open recalls, you\u2019ll want to get more info about them before you give anyone even a dollar of your money. If there are recent recalls but the work has already been completed, it\u2019s still important to know about to make sure the car is safe to drive. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that an open recall is no big deal unless you read into it yourself and make that decision on your own. \n\nIf you don\u2019t know where to find the VIN; if you\u2019re standing directly in front of the car looking at the front windshield, it should be engraved down near the bottom right corner of the windshield near where some US states put their registration stickers. You can enter the VIN on the NHTSA official website, and most car manufacturers have their own lookup systems on their websites as well.",

Getting fired was nothing personal but just business. Let me break it down\n\n1. First, OP and establishment served her too much alcohol. That is a sueable issue. If something happened to her, hands down the hammer will be back on the business. \n\n2. OP with business uniform took a drunk girl home from the bar. If she felt charitable OP would have called her an Uber. Why did she have to take her to her home and put her to bed...\n\n3. That was very inappropriate to do. Just because she is drunk doesn't give you the right to carry her home.. that is potentially a can of legal nightmare. The girl could have accused op of sexual assault. This comes back to the business. The business can get sued. \n\n4. Again, why would you ever think it is wise to take a drunk girl home because you are some hero who rescues drunk girls. The right thing would be to have her call someone to pick her up or call the ambulance. Most bars do this. Just call 911 and have her deal with her actions. Clear yourself from liability.\n\n5. What op did was extremely dangerous.. I was an RA on campus and one day a drunk girl was brought back from the bar extremely drunk by her friends. RA on duty didn't say anything. She died by morning from alcohol poisoning. If someone is extremely drunk, the worst thing you can do is let them sleep it off. You need to take them to the ER. Op had no clue what she had drank before. The right call would be to call 911 and let them handle it. He is not a professional.\n\n6. What she did is downright creepy. She did not come there to drink not knowing how she will get home. Why put herself out there to take her home? That by itself is just not right.. call a cab, don't be a creep. Who knows if she is a creep who sniffed her undies while she was passed out..",

Firing an employee for someone else\u2019s mistake is shift ass behaviour. \n\n2. A hotel employee in uniform escorting an obviously drunk woman back to the hotel - my automatic assumption would be exactly what OP has described. The hotel worker went out of their way to assist a drunk guest back to their room. Also, that you think stuffing a blackout drunk woman into an Uber is totes safe tells me that you are a dude. Check your privilege. \n\nActually, the entirety of the rest of your points can be answered with \u201ccheck your privilege\u201d.  As a young woman who used to work in a sleazy part of town, OP is acutely aware of the dangers faced by young women in that area. Especially if they are blackout drunk. It\u2019s entirely reasonable for her to have personally intervened. It\u2019s entirely reasonable to assume that a hotel worker escorting a drunk person back to the hotel is helping that hotel guest.  It\u2019s ludicrous to assume that a someone would bring a potential victim back to their place of work where everyone knows who she is.\n\nAdditionally, absolutely nothing you suggest makes any sense as a firing offense.",

With the wrongful dismissal suit, it's paid for by the labour board, and the idea is for y'all to enter mediation before going to court, and if you're at that point it's very clear it's a hostile work environment as they've pointed you out. So there's no real situation where the person is reemployed, or if currently employed and was pointed out for whatever reason(whether or not the complaint actually stood up). When the company's power is assured to go against you it's nice to know there's a level of \"appointed representation\".",

That's really the easiest and most believable scenario here, without making up a whole bunch of \"what if\"s. \n\nAs for naming the place, she absolutely should. Her boss was the one in the wrong; anyone looking to hire her will come across the story and will likely agree that what OP did was commendable and that her former boss overreacted by firing her. By naming the establishment, it would put pressure on her old boss to use discretion in situations like this instead of just firing without a thought.\n\nEdit: aw man, they deleted their comment. For those who didn't see it, it was this big long comment full of multiple different possible scenarios and schemes and theories... all predicated on the idea that OP was a dude, lol.",

Pictures are worth a thousand words, so if it looks kinda run down and trashy, chances are that it is. If you are planning a trip to Myrtle Beach, I suggest renting a beach house, Airbnb, or a hotel in Surfside or Garden City Beach. You might spend a little more but it would be worth it. Both are just a few miles south of Myrtle Beach and are a lot better in terms of quality of the stay. Keep my first bit of advice in mind when booking anywhere though.",

Call and say \u201chey I\u2019m going through town in a couple hours and I need someplace to get off the road. Since it\u2019s only a couple hours, do you have some special rate?\u201d  If they say they have hourly rates, it\u2019s a sleazy hotel.\n\nReputable hotels only want guests for full nights and only have housekeeping on day shifts. They\u2019ll charge you a full night\u2019s stay even if you\u2019re there a couple hours. A guest staying from 3 to 6 means the room is dirty all night, after all.\n\nSleazy hotels are set up for guests having a sex worker over for a couple hours and hen having housekeeping turn the room over for resale. Might get a guest 3 to 6, clean the room by 7 and have another there from 7:30 to 9:30. Clean again, then rented from 11 to 1.\n\nAlso look for smoking rooms. Many locales grandfathered existing ones in when they banned smoking rooms, and any place that keeps smoking rooms around does it for a reason, typically being people smoking things that they can\u2019t smoke outside. Crack or meth or weed where it\u2019s still illegal.\n\nKey words for reviews are things like \u201cloud neighbors\u201d, \u201cworn out beds\u201d, \u201clazy cleaning job\u201d, \u201cpolice in parking lot\u201d, \u201cdirty lobby\u201d and/or \u201cno breakfast\u201d.  Also \u201cgot a non-smoking room that stank of stale smoke\u201d. Those things don\u2019t matter when the intended clientele is people just looking to fuck or do drug deals or get high. And often there\u2019s little punishment for a hotel that doesn\u2019t enforce the nonsmoking room laws because the police have to prove that it\u2019s intentionally not being enforced.",

Friend got fired for not locking out a machine he got into. \n\nIt was an enclosure for a robot where the operator locks it out from a completely opposite side while having somebody open a door on the other end to clear jams, which happen pretty often there. Entire time working there we only ever had the operator lock out the robot and wait for an all clear from the associate inside, after the associate left the enclosure and waved for them to go ahead. So yeah, buddy got walked out after somebody complained to a supervisor about him clearing the jam without adding his own locks to the machine in addition to the operators. Supervisor kept saying it was because they knew about it, even though they didn't actually see it or anything and just took a single associates word on it, and that they had to do it because of that and how they had no choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFew weeks later I was standing with that same boss while one of their favorites got into a machine without locking it out, or hitting an E-stop, or even getting into it in a safe way, like, person put their whole ass body bent over a machine guard just to mess with the insides of the thing. I pointed it out to the boss, mentioned how that associate was constantly not hitting e-stops when working on the machines, or doing the whole lock out thing. They just shrugged and said it was fine and that, \"they didn't see nothing\"\n\nSame boss got pissed during employee surveys when everybody made the same complaint about them having obvious favorites, only for them to laugh about it with other supervisors afterwards and loudly proclaim how it was true.",

A fortiori, the employer may act peremptorily, arbitrarily, or inconsistently, without providing specific protections such as prior warning, fair procedures, objective evaluation, or preferential reassignment. Because the employment relationship is \"fundamentally contractual\" (Foley, supra, 47 Cal.3d 654, 696), limitations on these employer prerogatives are a matter of the parties' specific agreement, express or implied in fact. The mere existence of an employment relationship affords no expectation, protectible by law, that employment will continue, or will end only on certain conditions, unless the parties have actually adopted such terms. Thus if the employer's termination decisions, however arbitrary, do not breach such a substantive contract provision, they are not precluded by the covenant.\\[7\\]",

Rape allegation, regardless if false or mot, is literally the only reasonable expected outcome, hell even I think OP is omitting a little tom foolery so imagine the girl's stance. \n\nImagine going to your hotel & seeing staff, talking and having some chats to said staff, mentioning you are travelling alone. You go to another bar, and one of those staff is also there... Wild coincidence right? You've had a bit too much to drink, and the staff member who totally didnt stalk you across town offers to take you home.. you're drunk beyond comprehension, you're barely aware of whats happening. \n\nYou wake up and see a phone number next to you, in  YOUR room, negating the possibility you somehow made it home safe and alone. You message it, and its the same goddamn staff member you told that you were travelling alone, who coincidentally went to the same bar as, and managed to get you back into your room in a state you have absolutely no memory or recollection of. Hmmm i wonder what that poor guest would be thinking. \n\nOP overstepped so many lines & regardless of what actually happened, probably should have handled it far differently",

Nothing of what you said is logical and you are creating a scenario in your head to fit a narrative you created lol.\n\nThe most likely and logical scenario is that it is a corporation with strict employee protocols, one of them being to never enter a room with a guest unless neccessary (a rule in place most likely BECAUSE an ex-employee fraternized, hooked up, or sexually assaulted a guest at one point or another in the past).  So to be honest you are demonizing a manager that is probably following rules put in place FOR GUEST SAFETY AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT AND EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT. It makes complete sense for a company to have a no-nonsense policy about entering a guests room which is a very personal space and it's not like they have cameras in the rooms to corroborate OPs story. It is a company protecting its own ass against lawsuits and bad employee behavior (even if OP is a fantastic employee rules are rules).\n\nStick to your day job and don't become a detective or lawyer please like every other brain dead reddit detective out there.",

And it could cost him his job if he doesn't enforce it? The reason the OP gives is easy to see in their eyes, but to the boss with incompete information who has to make a call on company policy.\n\n- if we're going to throw the rape accusations around all willy nilly, let's go for it.  \"Honestly officer, I was just helping her back to her room!\" I'm sure has been used many times.  \n\n- no where did OP say their boss was a male\n\nPoint is, there are a lot of potential scenarios and defaulting to rape as the baseline case I told proven otherwise is outrageous and cheapens those who have been raped. \n\n I can easily see the company policy being if you see this situation, do not directly intervene and call the police or security to \n protect everyone involved.",

Although you're add-on of \"oh, just to hit on her!\" that is a weak attempt to backtrack it since you probably also know that hitting on and engaging in sexual activity with someone who is inebriated to that point is considered rape since they cannot give true consent.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may have subsequently thought differently via the discussions, which I think people are not given enough credit for being flexible minded in today's world and weighing information in changing up as long as they say that is why, and don't try to back walk it like they actually mean something else from the beginning form their later comments and subsequent edits to their original post.

Teachers aren't allowed behind closed doors with individual students. Doctors aren't allowed with undressed patients without a nurse present \n\nShe broke a huge rule which sadly is in place for a damned good reason.\n\nHell, in many hotels cleaning staff aren't allowed to enter rooms with guests in them for any reason whatsoever unless they're paired up.\n\nIt sounds like you either aren't concerned about the possibility of staff assaulting guests, or you want to make a sexist exception to the rules.\n\nFor all we know, the hotel has an excellent policy for dealing with drunk guests and she simply didn't follow it. Or, she broke a rule that needs modification for a good reason.",

Which DOES matter because we have to base our practices and policies on what COULD happen and not what happened in a best case scenario. \n\nLots of sleazy men in the area, right? How does the manager definitively know who is sleazy and who isn't? It is most definitely unprofessional to assume since you get a generally good feeling about a person that you can trust them in sensitive times, especially when your OWN job is on the line.\n\nSo here you have an employee off duty escorting a clearly intoxicated guest to *their private room* with no other accompaniment. This is a key difference between another anecdote of someone's family member who did something similar but with a witness. What's worse is that this same employee served this guest alcohol earlier in the night. \n\nI'm not saying I believe OP did anything nefarious, but I am saying that if OP was a sleazy person like many others in the area, they could have done something nefarious and spun the same story that OP is claiming. It's a cloud of details that cannot possibly be confirmed by anyone but OP because the only witness is blackout drunk. \n\nIf OP had called an uber, then the uber driver could be a sober witness to the incident. If OP had sought medical attention for the person, then any medical staff could be considered sober witnesses to the event. If OP had brought the person straight to the front desk and explained the situation, then the front desk attendant would be a sober witness to the event. However, the only person that knows what really happened is OP. The Manager's decision of how to react to this serious incident had to be based on the fact that there is NO WAY to confirm anything that OP says. Not due to any suspicions of what OP did  but due to the lack of corroboration.\n\nThis is serious. This is the reputation of a business that invites people from all over to spend the night in their building and rely on them for safety. How would you feel if you blacked out and found an employee of your hotel in your bedroom, not dressed in uniform? It's a sensitive situation. \n\nI am NOT claiming that OP did anything immoral. But I must insist that OP did behave inappropriately for someone in the hospitality industry. I do not care if you would give OP a wink and indicate that this was a good decision. It was kind and nothing more.",

My aunt however came under a similar situation where a man passed out drunk while she was cleaning the tables of the hotel she worked in. The poor guy clearly was suffering from an emotional breakdown and not only she bothered to carry him upstairs, she got help from one of the workers to do that too. Stayed with him for some time since they feared he was sufering from liver failure too.\n\nAfterwards while the manager did comment on the situation and warned that she should have \"told them what happened before taking any action\", he didn't make any further moves, specially not kicking her out of the job for helping an innocent man.\n\nNo idea where you live in since this happened in Brazil, but i believe regardless of the place where you live in, public perception is secondary to helping human lives.",

That's how this whole thing works.\n\nIs it a \"severe policy violation\" to help an intoxicated young woman to safety? As evidenced by the *multiple other bar and hotel owners/managers who have commented on this thread*, this seems to be a situation where the safety of the guest and the intentions of the employee (who, let's reiterate, was not on the clock and was helping the girl back from a *different bar*) could play a major role in determining management's reaction. The others in this thread who work in this industry (in their *opinion*, lol) seem to think OP was in the right and at most should've received a write-up and a talking-to about policy, as her intention was clearly to ensure the safety of a vulnerable young woman. Her boss (in my *opinion*) chose to stick with a zero-tolerance mindset instead of recognizing that OP was acting out of altruism and concern for another person's wellbeing. \n\nI'm confused that you seem upset by the idea of people sharing their opinions on a discussion forum, but I'm more perplexed by your lack of humanity and regard for nuance. Yes, there are policies in place for a reason. Yes, safety is of the utmost importance in the hospitality industry. In this scenario, which is definitely out-of-the-ordinary and probably unprecedented at this particular hotel, *it is my opinion* that the manager should have shown a little discretion and evaluated the situation based on both OP's intentions and the possible ramifications of her *not* intervening\u2014 i.e. this girl facing assault or rape, being robbed, etc. as OP implied the possibility of those things, and the hotel having to deal with police, an ambulance, investigators... OP saved this girl from potential harm and that's that. She was off the clock, they were in a different bar, and the only connection to OP's job was the customer's hotel room that OP helped her back to. Many good managers (as evidenced in this thread) would have commended OP, even if they had to write her up, and wouldn't have fired her.",

Others are people who have been similarly slighted and want to see you \"stick it to the man\". \n\nWhile I'm not saying that anyone is wrong, having read your most recent update my only advise is that you take care of yourself as best you can. While financial hardship can be massively stressful, especially if you're already dealing with poor mental health, remember that you are more than a job. \n\nI'm glad your attempt failed and that you are in the care of trained professionals. I hope they're able to give you the help you need. I hope that you come back from this stronger and healthier. The world seems pretty dark right now, but there are good things too. While perfection is unrealistic, it is possible to achieve a life where you are content. \n\nLean on whatever support system you have, you are not a burden. Be kind to yourself. Be your own avocate in accessing the care you need. And if you ever need support from an impartial stranger, don't hesitate to reach out. \n\nBased on what is admittedly a very small glimpse into your life, you seem like a wonderful person. So, from one internet stranger to another, I'm glad that you're still here. Wishing you nothing but the best moving forward.",

But even in those cases generally violating an explicit workplace policy would be still grounds for termination. Then the legal argument would come down to if OP's actions constitute \"fraternization\" in violation of the policy or not.\n\nSmart move in an at-will state is just to not give any reasons when you fire someone because you don't have to.",

Now if you file for unemployment and they want to dispute it they may have to provide some justification for cause but even if they don't or they lose that dispute you still have no cause against them letting you go in the first place.\n\nHell even if your employer *does* fire you for something that is protected, good luck proving it.  Actual verdicts for wrongful termination that don't involve violating a non-at-will employee's contract are exceedingly rare.   Even if your boss wants to fire you because you're old, or black, gay, Jewish, a woman, whatever, the burden when you file a lawsuit is on you to prove it and it's very easy for them to come up with another reason and say it was that unless they did something abysmally stupid like admitted on paper or in front of witnesses that they fired you for a protected reason or created an email trail of hassling you about a protected thing before firing you.\n\nI'm not defending it by any means.  Most of it is hard to swallow.    Some of it is straight up fucking evil and unjust, but it is what it is and as much as we should change it, people who tell folks to file an unemployment suit in situations like these are not only living in a fantasy but actively causing harm by perpetuating the idea that workers in the US have protections they flat out don't.",

At-Will employment is just that, you can leave the arrangement At-Will, with zero notice or reprecissions. It's very difficult  to lock an American worker into a contract that forces them to keep working or face some penalty.\n\nRight to work, is that you have a right to work without external conditions. Unions are a good thing, but if a union doesn't provide enough benefit to justify it's existence without a legal mandate to join it should die.",

For example: If you manage to get \"Twice per day at a time of my choosing I can get up and scream at the top of my lungs for 10 straight minutes\" put into your employee contract, and then you're fired later for doing so, that's wrongful termination.\n\nAn employee under a contract that provides explicit protections is not at-will. However if your contract doesn't explicitly guarantee employment then the terms don't protect you from dismissal. You could absolutely still be fired for screaming at the top of your lungs so long as your contract doesn't require cause for termination even if it says you're allowed to scream at the top of your lungs, any civil action would be for breach of contract not wrongful termination (and you would lose on those grounds as well if your contract didn't guarantee you employment). Some states have further protections for implied contracts, but that's not a general condition of at-will employment and varies greatly by state/locality/court to what it actually means. \n\nPlus all of that goes out the window if you violate the contract and any company policies that are tied to it. Which OP's boss claims she did via fraternization against policy. Idk whether or not that would hold up in court, but it's not relevant if OP doesn't have grounds for wrongful termination or breech of contract.\n\n>wrongful dismissal by covenant of good faith breach. \n\nThat's not a thing in 39 of the 49 at-will states.\n\nAnd neither of these have any bearing on OP.",

She was wearing slacks that zipped up the back and they were unzipped so he asked her if she was alright, zipped her slacks up and she asked him for a ride home. He agreed and helped her to his car and proceeded to take her home. He didn\u2019t know that she was upset because she was fighting with her boyfriend but when the boyfriend saw them leave together he and his friends started chasing them and ran my brother off the road. The girl went through the windshield (no seatbelts, this was in 1981) and was killed instantly, my brother hit his head on the steering wheel so hard it bent in half. He was taken off life support two days later after his kidneys and lungs were donated. \n\nThe title of this post brought that back to me",

The female guests starts buying drinks for everyone there and starts talking with another guy who just gave off a bad vibe to me. As I\u2019m finishing up I can tell the female guest is getting pretty trashed. Trumper noticed it too and we kinda gave each other a look like, \u201cthis could be bad,\u201d as skeevy guest was definitely talking her up. \n\nI had to leave because I had meetings the next morning, and was going to tell the bartender to keep an eye on her, but he disappeared. Trumper was still there and I told him I was a little worried about her. He told me he\u2019d make sure to tell the bartender we were concerned for her safety, and as I was walking to the elevator, I saw him talking to one of the female servers and kinda subtlety gesturing to the female guest. \n\nNeedless to say, I don\u2019t know what happened but hopefully she got back to her room safely.",

Knowing her sisters (and not being a piece of shit) my friend and I pretty much carried her back to her place (almost exactly where we had seen her earlier) let ourselves in with her key and explained to her roommates why we were carrying her and asked if they were good to take care of her. Days later, I got a Facebook message from her sister saying something like \"I can't believe you're going to try to fuck my sister when she is that drunk. I expect better from you.\" Uh, yeah, because I am better than that. Now I'm down a friend because you want to think I'm that shitty guy. Better off without a friend like you that thinks I would do that, and you're better off without a boss that doesn't care about his guests well being or his employees intentions.

      "text": "I want you to know that sometimes when we stand up to do the right thing, the universe moves us. One door closes, because we are no longer adequate at the level we were at. And then the next door opens, so that we me step into the more evolved role that we are becoming ready for. \n\nIt can be hard to know how to follow the closing and opening of doors, until we are able to understand the principle. Once we begin to get it, we may feel more prepared to look ahead, rather than looking behind and dwelling on loss. \n\nI believe very much that there is something beautiful ahead of you, and that you will be able to find it. And it likely involves stepping into your power by supporting and empowering those who need it, offering safety and protection and care. There are so many doors that may open in this direction. For example, a SafeWay house. \n\nIn the end only you are the right person to navigate what is the next right step for you. And, I can tell by your attempt, that you feel the world deeply, and care deeply, and have great empathy. That is powerful. \n\nPlease be well, heal, and arouse yourself into the amazing and compassionate person that only you can be, whatever that looks like to you, in full acceptance of who you are, whatever that looks like in any moment of our ups and downs. \n\nQuite often, for me, it is the most challenging days that are my favorite, for they reveal to me the struggles I am facing in stepping forward on my true path. I do my best to accept myself wherever I am, whoever I am, without judgement. In acceptance I can focus on where I am and what I can do next. Gradual progress is stable progress. These things take time.\n\nBlessings to your way.",

If you think you have cause to sue, there are lawyers who will work on contingency. In other words, they don't get paid unless you win, and they take a cut of the settlement as payment (anywhere from 30-50%, but 50% of $50,000 is still $25,000 in your bank account). \n\nIf you can't find a lawyer on contingency then you probably don't have a good case to begin with and they won't waste your time.

It was a neighborhood sports drag show bar, small capacity, mid to sketch neighborhood. And once a person had to go home in a cab but needed an escort. I can\u2019t say we tussled but she didn\u2019t want to get into that cab and/but I worked at a bar who valued service industry patrons so I was gonna take her home thank god Sue found her keys.  Once in the cab every single thing vibed for my customer, a local bartender, a vivacious and beautiful woman, and she wanted me to come up to her place.  I was shooting down that idea when I noticed our driver who had perfect hair was playing electronic dance music that was thrumming away encouragingly and sounded stompy but also low key.  We pull up to her address, on a busy 4 lane one way city street and I\u2019m assisting her out of the cab and up to the street and I ask perfect hair to wait for me and I haven\u2019t paid but he knows where I work and he nods smiling without looking up. Keys are used and I assist her up 4 flights of stairs and she is pretty tenacious about me staying but some near the bed magic took over and she just poured into her bed, happy that someone was taking her shoes off and I scampered downstairs  hoping HOPING that the young cabbie was still there cuz our drive had taken us from kind of not cool at night to definitely not at all cool at night and mr good music hair was there and HE HAD STOPPED THE METER. \nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that possibly saving a life or presenting an assault is one of the biggest things you\u2019ll do in your entire life, and you did that. Unhesitatingly. A trillion recent bones crackle for the woman you helped: if only there\u2019d been someone like you there to help them.  Not to downplay any financial hardship, but when you are older than now you won\u2019t give a fuck about that job but you will forever have this event to turn to whenever you doubt yourself: I did the brave thing automatically and that was magnificent: you know it, I know it, and mr perfect hair chill vibe cab music knows it.  \nGood for you.",

Students must establish appropriate personal boundaries and not engage in any behavior that could reasonably lead to even the appearance of impropriety.*\n\nMost definitely, you should contact an attorney and sue to get your job back or to get compensation.

Her room mate says to me \"I will take it from here, you can leave now\". Then later on in the year that same room mate apologized to me saying \"Now that I know you better I feel bad for how I reacted that night, Knowing now that you are not the type to take advantage of a drunken girl I would have now acted differently then\"",

In reading through comments from others I noticed I wasn\u2019t seeing you respond to anyone\u2019s questions, so I checked your post history to see if you\u2019d responded to any comments here.  I noticed you posted elsewhere about your bipolar diagnosis and recent medication change that helped you to be more aware of problems you\u2019ve caused in your life.\n\nThis stands out to me because I\u2019ve seen many occasions when a coworker has been seen as a \u201cdifficult personality\u201d or an \u201cattitude problem\u201d and managers have been frustrated because other staff complain but there\u2019s just not enough of a concrete and documentable rule breakage to fire them over.  So then the manager watches closely for any technicality they can use for letting the employee go.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to be mean or put you down\u2014I worked in mental health for a very long time and I worked with plenty of kind-hearted well-meaning people who could not maintain healthy relationships because of behaviors related to mental health issues like yours.  I feel for you.  But, I strongly suspect that what happened to you is the kind of scenario I described above.  The situation you described is the kind of thing where, if your boss likes you (or even just doesn\u2019t dislike you), the boss pulls you aside and is like, \u201cHey, you have to be careful doing something like that, it looks bad and is technically against policy.\u201d  For your boss to outright fire you suggests that he (or she?) already wanted to fire you anyway, and you just provided the documentable excuse.\n\nEdit: Oh, I wanted to add a suggestion for future jobs: Politely solicit coworkers and bosses for feedback.  People aren\u2019t going to just come out and tell you if they think you\u2019re nuts or have attitude issues.  But if you talk to someone one on one and say something like, \u201cHey, I want to be the best I can be while I\u2019m working here, and was wondering if you could give me any feedback on anything I could do better.\u201d then people might feel more comfortable bringing up things that you might not be aware of, and they\u2019ll also be more likely to look at your behaviors in a more positive light instead of just thinking you\u2019re a bad person.",

I didn\u2019t work for the hotel but they were a business partner for the promoters I worked for.  \n\nI shared an Uber with the drunk girl back to the hotel because I was going there anyway to drop off some paperwork for my job.\n\nShe insisted on having another drink at the bar. I was still technically working so I didn\u2019t really want to but I shared a super expensive shot of bourbon with her and then I told her I was heading back to my hotel because I still had spreadsheets to do for the next morning. \n\nShe was barely able to walk so I got her to her elevator and then I planned on walking her to her room.\n\nShe became belligerent in the elevator saying I should have paid for the $20 shot at the bar, etc. I was just using her to get free booze and some other horse shit. She was going off the rails quickly and when we got to her floor she didn\u2019t want me to walk her to her room.\n\nI had the hotel\u2019s number in my phone so I called and asked for Security and told them there was a falling down drunk woman on the third floor.\n\nThe guy said he could see us on the cameras and he said he would make sure she got to her room safely. \n\nI felt like I dodged a bullet with that one.  \n\nI don\u2019t understand why they fired you if you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

An employed bartender takes a black out drunk female to her room. Doesn\u2019t use entrances visible to public but instead uses employee side doors through staff areas which aren\u2019t suited for the public. \n\n1. If patron claims something inappropriate happened, company could be at risk of lawsuit. And everything in the public eye would look really bad even if it was all kosher. \n\n2. If the person got hurt/injured in the staff area, they would again be at risk when they see that an employee took them through that area. \n\n3. If any employee items/stock went missing, the patron could easily be blamed.\n\nI also want to say that if I were in OP position, I would\u2019ve done the same. We are human. We are always looking out for vulnerable people in need. And personally, I disagree with termination of her job. \n\nHowever, I think an employer was worried that this could\u2019ve led to something much worse. To protect themselves, they fire OP. \n\nOP should be proud they lost their job under these circumstances. If there\u2019s ever someone in need, helping them is worth losing a job for. \n\nNext time, consider having the police (non emergency number) help out the drunk person or call their friends to help them out if possible.",

There was a girl in the bathroom sitting in her own throw up naked from the waist down bc she was previously on the toilet. I proceed to clean her up, literally wiped her butt for her and asked her if she had a ride home. She mentioned a boyfriend so I texted him from her phone which was on 1%. I texted her boyfriend my phone number so he could communicate his arrival and I could get her out safely (it was snowing as well). I found out a few days later that she was telling people that she doesn\u2019t like me because I gave her boyfriend my number FML. I have never met this girl in my life, but she knows a lot of people that I know. I\u2019m not in a stink about the situation but c\u2019mon??? Seriously????",

If you weren't management or maid services, you weren't allowed on the upper floors for any reason, ever. Under no circumstances. And it was one of the few things they were absolutely strict with, no holding back, it was almost certainly a termination. However, they did usually review it. But still, it usually resulted in termination. That's just how they were. \n\nTheir take was, just call security and let the people who are supposed to escort and protect guests, do just that. And security was always present, too. Which alleviated the need to take matters into your own hands. Regardless, it was one of the strangest things I'd ever heard because there were some times I'd get invited back to someone's room. Either for a gift they wanted to give me for the week of service, and even a few illicit offers lol One person just needed help carrying their shit. They learned about bellhops that day. \n\nSorry about the termination, bud but I'm sure you'll rebound strong",

If you wait a few days, your boss might very well cool down to the point where whether you are fired or not is a \"maybe\" instead of a \"certainty.\"  Essentially, you need to have a chat with your boss and find out a few things about why he decided to fire you.  One question you might want to ask your boss is whether or not you are eligible for rehiring based on the internal reasons for the firing.    You also want to get the official reason - the reason he would tell a court.     From his mannerisms and the exact wording you might be able to find the right way to argue yourself back into your job.    Finding out the exact policies you broke will help you a lot.    \nAnother possible route --   If you can have a conversation with his boss (your boss's boss) you might find that he or she is sympathetic or will at least admit that what you did is not a mandatory termination.  That's just one idea.    I'm not saying do that right away - you probably want to save that one for later.  I'm saying file that away as a part of a creative package of attempting to better the situation.   Your boss might have been forced to fire you because he thought you broke Rule X -- but if HIS boss thinks it really was only Rule Y or Rule Z then maybe you only get a write-up or a warning.  \n\n\nAnother possibility - you might have been fired for reasons approximating \"political reasons\" and the organization would be happy to have you at another one of their locations.",

If you were a random stranger they would have got to the door of the hotel and the stranger would have been stopped by security, doorman or concierge. I have seen some seriously messed up stuff and while every employee would want to jump in and help we wouldn\u2019t be able to or we lose of jobs. My advice get out of hospitality while you still have your morals, it\u2019s a soul destroying industry. \nUnfortunately hotels have weird rules but necessary to protect their employees and the company, and while you did a good deed it could have turned out horribly if she ended up being a lunatic thankfully she wasn\u2019t and said thank you. \nI\u2019m not assuming you\u2019re in the States, I worked in Irish hotels and the word union is laughed at, I would find it very surprising to find a solicitor that would take this on as unfair dismissal or wrongful termination. \nAll the best, you will find a new job and you should hold your head high knowing you got her to a safe place. You did the right thing and unfortunately you suffered consequences.",
