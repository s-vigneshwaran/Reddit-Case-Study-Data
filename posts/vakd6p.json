Yeah, no!  It doesn't work like that.  \n* *OMG you self identify as what the fuck ever*. I don't care. *Youre a proud: Political Faction, Pick a religion, or Race. Attemp to censor anyone that doesn't pander to your bewlshit*. Error 404: fucks are still not found. \n* If my taxes are used to fix problems. Then explain why the roads in Pennsylvania are shit fuck at best. Bridges are over there like: I'm fighting for my life dot png. The power infostructure, lol.  Even Mitsubishi and a couple other manufacturers have came out over the past 9 years and have stated some countries will not be able to support a large influx of EVs. What is the the percentage now 98% of the water is polluted in the world right now. Those are things my taxes can fix. But naw, those fucks, from both parties are wasting time, and tax money arguing over dump shit. Meanwhile seeing how many billions of dollars being sent to Ukraine. With biblical amounts of excuses. Meanwhile I'm over here like: thats a lot of mouth for someone that still owes me money from the taxes they stole from my ass. (Still haven't seen my returns, while the IRS website be like: we're behind because of the Rona.) \n\n[Socrates](https://imgur.com/a/zf4kkeJ) might be onto something.",
