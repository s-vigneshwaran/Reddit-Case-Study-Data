Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if governments who wanted to wage pointless wars on other countries for oil or other resources had to convince men and women it was a cause worth dying for, or else they wouldn\u2019t have armies to do it? Or better yet, wouldn\u2019t it be better to solve our problems in more peaceful ways?\n\nIn a war scenario, it\u2019s obviously better to cook and clean than to literally die, so I understand the (unfunny and insensitive) jokes being made in the OP, but it\u2019s not a binary choice\u2014the people should have more power here, and shouldn\u2019t be used as pawns of our governments, and realizing that we\u2019re all victims in this scenario is the first step to building that solidarity.",

Some men are more weak and nurturing, and some women are more strong and militaristic.

Wouldn\u2019t the world be better if neither of those pressures existed? Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if governments who wanted to wage pointless wars on other countries for oil or other resources had to convince men and women it was a cause worth dying for, or else they wouldn\u2019t have armies to do it? Or better yet, wouldn\u2019t it be better to solve our problems in more peaceful ways?\n\n>In a war scenario, it\u2019s obviously better to cook and clean than to literally die, so I understand the (unfunny and insensitive) jokes being made in the OP, but it\u2019s not a binary choice\u2014the people should have more power here, and shouldn\u2019t be used as pawns of our governments, and realizing that we\u2019re all victims in this scenario is the first step to building that solidarity.\n\nObvoiusly its better to cook and clean than it is to literally die, like youre pointing out. While it may be an unfunny and insensitive joke the OP is making, they do also have a point. Feminists will often advocate for equality and the abolishment of traditional gender roles when it benefits them, but when traditional gender roles does benefit them, they will often be in favor of such inequality and won't call for the abolishment of the traditional gender roles that do benefit them. Its this kind of weird hypocrisy and double standards within the feminist movement that made me as a woman be critical of feminism and take a stand against it, as I cant support double standards. \n\nAs the saying goes \"Equality.. when convienent.. or equality, but only when it benefit myself\". Thats a huge issue I wish feminism would address. Lots of feminists are fine with inequality between the sexes, and men being treated in discriminatory ways, so long as it doesnt affect themselves or other women negatively. Lots of feminists also hold the view that since they have been discriminated against by men, or that since women are \"systemically oppressed\", that that gives them the right to discriminate against men. In my opinion, two wrongs dont make a right, but theres a lot of this \"tit for tat\" kind of rhetoric circling around in feminist groups, which is part of why I could never in good faith call myself a feminist. \n\nLike if you want to abolish traditional gender roles as a feminist, you dont advocate for how you wanna stay at home and cook and clean and be the postergirl for traditional gender roles as soon as war breaks out. It would make you look disingenous and fake and take away your credibility as a feminist who preaches about equality and abolishing gender roles.",

It was part of my course at uni last year. A feminist class? I took one myself at uni and the class and literature only solidified the current negative impression I have on feminism today.. so yeah I doubt them Reading feminist literature is going to help. For someone who's already a feminist, it's probably going to entrench them further into the ideology of feminism. I'm not sure subscibing to an ideology is the best way to be a critical and independent thinker, but hey that's just my thoughts.\n\n\n>Feminists basically agree that the patriarchy hurts men too and want to remove those inequalities as well.\n\nThen why do a large amount of feminists blame men for all their issues? I've seen plenty of feminists in feminism subs here on Reddit twisting lots of statistics into showing that women are the victims and men are the oppressors no matter what the statistics show, and that women are hurt the most by patriarchy blah blah, and that the issues men are hurt by are nowhere near as bad as the ones women are hurt by. Do feminists remove inequalities by treating men in such discriminatory ways? Cause that's what they do when they downplay or invalidate mens issues and solely or mainly focus on women's issues. \n\nPersonally I don't believe we (in the western world at least) live in a patriarchy. I believe there's traditional gender roles that influence people in positive and negative ways. I also believe in egalitarianism or the equal and fair treatment of both men and women, which feminism has greatly failed at.\n\n>The documentary The Mask You Live In covers some of this really well.\n\nI'll have a look at it, thanks.",
