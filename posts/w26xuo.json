A couple examples I can think about\n\nYou've probably seen the men's awareness conference being protested by feminists and eventually being shut down  \n\nThis is relatively old, but there was a (first one I believe) men's shelter called CAFE that was being opened, had backlash.\n\nCassie Jaye, was a feminist that's acknowledged that men has issues, made a documentary about it. Was eventually slandered and cast aside because of this\n\nErin Pizzey, another ex feminist, said that women can be just as violent towards men (not relevant), was slandered and has had many death threats for pointing this out\n\nHaving grievances for someone from a past event is fine, but that's usually the excuse to bash men broadly. You can see that on social media and real life, that's the misandry. \n\nAnd also the ideology depicts men as oppressors for women under a 'patriarchy' when that's far from truth. There are many that are moderate, or radical that believe this",
