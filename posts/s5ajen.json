  "text": "TIFU by watching futanari porn and getting caught by my father.\nSo, I was looking through rule 34 and decided to watch some futanari porn, as it never disappoints me and is overall pretty nice porn in general in my opinion. I found this nice video and started\u2026 uhh you get it. Just a dude being a dude to some futanari. \n\nLiterally right as I\u2019m about to finish wanking, my fucking father comes in to tell me breakfasts ready. \n\nI don\u2019t know who looked more traumatized and in shock. \n\nAnd when I thought it couldn\u2019t get any fucking worse, I came. I fucking came all over my keyboard. It\u2019s like we were both paralyzed with fear. He left a few minutes after standing still in fear, disappointment, and sadness. \n\nBreakfast was as awkward as it gets when you catch your son jerking off to futanari rule 34.\n\nThat was about as awkward as it gets when you get caught jerking off to anime chicks with dicks. My dad was in the military so he\u2019s pretty tough and will probably get over this. However, for some odd reason I think this might just be more traumatizing than watching your own friends die in combat. \n\nI fucking hate myself and want to die. My friends are gonna bully me so hard if I tell them, and yet I feel like I need to confess about what happened. I think I can take being bullied by Reddit.\n\nTLDR; Got caught watching hentai chicks with dicks, and I might get disowned.\n\nEdit 1: Hey guys I got banned from Reddit and can only update posts. I removed the bi thing. My reasoning at the time was a girl who has a cock is pretty bi. I mean I\u2019m attracted to girls and guys so a girl with a cock seemed pretty bi to me but I\u2019m kinda wrong since straight people can also like futa.\n\nAlso fuck off you degenerates I\u2019m not sharing the sauce. It\u2019s a hardcore pounding video on nhentai. The girl has pink hair. I send you on a mighty fap quest to find it.\n\nDad got pissed and yelled at me. Mom cried. Life is awkward and I woke up to over 20k upvotes. Dad even threatened to kick me out. He\u2019s a pussy though and didn\u2019t do it. We had a talk. He\u2019s seen weirder shit but he was surprised to see his own son like weird shit like futa and hentai. Mom might\u2019ve disowned me but at this point I\u2019m too numb to care.\n\nWhoever gave this a wholesome award is going to hell.",

Yes, if I\u2019m totally honest, I would hate to find him looking at porn of any kind, I\u2019d rather he be monogamous and find his true love (whatever their gender) on the first try, have an epic love story, and never look at anyone else once he found that love\u2026but that\u2019s super unlikely. Life is complicated. Also, if your mom is a passionate woman, there\u2019s a good chance she masturbated picturing all kinds of odd things when she was going through puberty, if she doesn\u2019t still (women with good imaginations are good at recalling images, more of us don\u2019t look at porn to get off, but images in our memories are kinda the equivalent. It\u2019s human nature.) \n\nBut there are a lot of horrible types of porn. Chicks with dicks would NOT really bother me any more than the most basic vanilla porn. There are only a couple types that would mean an intervention (hurting other people in the porn (not bdsm, but actually hurting people), children, eating feces\u2026), but even then, I\u2019d still love my kid and hope we could help him. The most important thing I want for my kid is that in sexual relationships is that he is safe, doesn\u2019t get used and manipulated, and doesn\u2019t use or manipulate others, only respectful, consensual interactions.\n\nSrsly, if mom and dad are really close and supportive, he told her as soon as he could for her moral support. If this is that case, they\u2019ll work out their awkward feelings about it together. They may be awkward around you for a little while, but if you ever had any love from your parents (which I\u2019m sure you did, or you wouldn\u2019t care what your dad thinks, also, he made you breakfast. So I think he\u2019s a caring person), this won\u2019t change that. They just know you aren\u2019t that innocent anymore. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019ll be awkward for a while.\n\nIf your mom and dad don\u2019t have the best relationship, he probably won\u2019t tell her. \n\nLast thought: I am sure that if people are honest, we\u2019re all a little bit bisexual. Everyone has gotten aroused at some point by imagery of both sexes, even if they aren\u2019t at all interested in acting on it, and it\u2019s coming more from a narcissist feeling, and they are more strongly gay or straight and not fully bi. It\u2019s easy to understand bisexuality if people are honest about their own arousal.",

We were like \"haha funni condom\" and we were dumb enough to decide to take it home. I was the one who ultimately took it home for some reason. He dared me to open it and just have my finger wear it but I never carried through with it. I just hid it between the wall and my bed.\n\nFast forward a year, and I'm like \"that condom's still there, right?\" checked the same place I put it in and it was not there. Maybe I took it out and threw it away someday? Its gone, shouldn't be worrying about it.\n\nFast forward again another year, and my dad has bought these new TVs for me and my brother. They could be mounted on the wall so we just did a massive overhaul of our rooms. My dad was cleaning where I hid the condom and it just fell out. He chuckled, gave it to me and just let me throw it away. My mom was also in my room with us and she was like \"What's so funny?\" But my dad kept the secret. I was forever grateful that day. His laugh there was fantastic.\n\nTL;DR Me and my friend found a condom, I took it home, forgot about it then my dad found it. He kept the secret though and he probably forgot about it.",

So everyone thinks there is something wrong. It so annoying to get the question \"what's wrong?\" Out of the blue while in the middle of a thought to figure out how to make an intelligent and meaningful response in 280 characters.  LOL",

Everybody gossips, very few people actually keep secrets, and nobody knows in advance who is going to. \n\nFor example I'm 100% sure his dad is not going to keep this a secret, as he is going to tell at least one person: mom. And if they ever are on the wrong terms then mom might gossip this to one of Mr. Futanari's brother, then that brother would tell one his pals while at a party just to have a conversation topic... and yeah.\n\nOr, more realistically, the guy is going to tell this to his best friend, then they are going to not be as good friends anymore because it's actually rare to keep a great relationship for life with high school friends (we all go separate ways), then that friend is gonna tell everybody this story at uni parties, and then those people will tell the story to those that attended that same high school. \n\nI know gossip of a few high school classmates from people that went to uni with them, because people talk, and within a city or a country everybody is one or two people away from knowing each other. Oh, and I know that somebody at a master's degree was talking shit behind my back, because that person  said that to one of his friends, who then told that to another friend in a whole different profession, and that one happened to tell me about it. This always happens.\n\nSo, keep your big secrets to yourself, and know that when you tell anything to somebody (whether personal or business-wise) then you are telling that to everybody within that person's contacts. Which, a whole lot of times include people that you know too. And don't start gossip either, because you are going to get the reputation of being an ass as well.",

Like, making a cat girl or some super sci-fi shit would actually be easier!)",

So I got to the bathroom and started peeing and immediately felt the weirdest sensation. Apparently the condom stayed on when I went flaccid and I was peeing with it on. The fucking thing started to fill up like a pissy water balloon. The feeling made me panic so I pulled it off real quickly and just left the condom in the urinal. When I got on my computer later that day I had about 20 tabs of ebony porn open.",

In fact, if there were ever a moment in which that was not true, somewhere out there is a dude who *deliberately* gets into weirder shit just so that he can believe himself to be the weirdest wanker out there. Unfortunately this generates an internet full of weirder and weirder porn as time continues.\n\nOr think of it this way. Imagine the porn from 1950. Ya got pinups, Tijuana bibles and probably a few racy photos, maybe a really good deck of cards. Imagine what those guys would think when confronted with the porn of today.\n\nNow, imagine what people will be wanking to in 2094. That shit is *terrifying*.",

[Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dream_of_the_Fisherman%27s_Wife) Hokusai is one of Japan's most famous artists, you may be familiar with his piece [The Great Wave](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa). Tentacles took off in animated smut due to censorship laws against showing genitals, and phallic tentacles didn't fall under that restriction. At this point, it's barely considered strange.",

It has no effect on me or anyone else. For them, it describes what they are and that's all that matters.\n\nDoes it make *sense*? No, not really. But nothing about attraction really makes any sense anyways.\n\nAlthough I'm curious about your first statement. What about \"gender, sex and genitals are not the same\" makes you think I have the wrong idea about what sex is? Gender is a social construct based upon traits, sex is what gametes we can produce, and genitals are what we use for *reproduction. None of these are the same thing",

The following is for a regular cheap wired membrane keyboard, the most likely type.\n\nMost keyboards come apart pretty easily, they're held together by about 8 screws. Depending on the construction, the top panel may just come free. It might also have a small circuit board controlling the lights and attaching to the USB cable screwed on. Disconnect that too. The keys will pop right off with a little force, don't worry, they pop right back on. If you're not sure you can put them all back in the right place, take a picture first. You should now have loose keys, and the soiled piece of plastic free from the electronics. You can wash them in the sink. Make sure everything is dry before putting it back together, you may want to air dry the keys for a few hours because of all the crannies.\n\nAlternately, you can pop the keys, and clean it with some rubbing alcohol and qtips. This will probably be pretty tedious.",

It was around a corner bend of a hallway so no one seen me and I just lived with my mum who loves privacy more than me. It is amusing in hindsight as we had to share a computer in the early 00s, which was in my room. My futon sofa thing was behind it, as well as the door. At that time my mother discovered internet dating hence spent nights in chat rooms and hell if I dared to glance at her screen. She never looked at mine either (well, the same screen, but you get it). The luxury of having personal computers nowadays...\n\nI also had a friend as a teenager who had parents that were obsessed with her slacking off when studying (she did not) as they wanted her to become a doctor, like them. Anytime they perceived her as being lazy - they punished her by taking her bedroom doors (yep, dismantled the whole frame) and looking through her phone. As you might suspect - she ended up drinking a lot behind their backs (then again, we all did as we went to one of those stupid posh, elite schools). \n\nHowever, does not compare to a friend whose parents installed cameras everywhere in the house, including behind her back in her bedroom which showed her computer screen. Whenever we talked on Skype, parents suspiciously kept walking around and standing in the hallway. In their case - it was not only to control their kid but the dad was paranoid because he was a rich oil baron. It did not occur to him to secure those cameras because one day I wondered if he did ... so I connected to their fancy home server ... also unsecure and yep - cameras all accesible and indexed online. Friend ended moving out and disowned herself (as in - she did, legally).",

The parenting idea of just having open discussions is not preventative, though the general mindset here is \"just talk\". I don't care what she's talking about, or really to who. I care about what she says and does.\n\nTelling her to not degrade herself on the internet as a teenager did not work, so the parenting advice in these threads are flawed. Open door, no door, no phone. Or don't do it. She did it. Discussions are over. She's thirteen and shouldn't be putting her ass on the internet. I'm not shaming her by no damn means, I'm trying to teach her objectifying herself like an insta-hoe is the wrong path. Also objectifying herself to prove to her boyfriend she loves him is rediculous.",

Sexual orientation has never described people\u2019s types with accuracy. It\u2019s simply the sex of the people one is capable of being sexually attracted to in relation to one\u2019s own sex. It is objective, whereas \u201ctypes\u201d are typically subjective. I, as a homosexual male, have no interest in what most people would consider \u201cmasculine\u201d males. Does this make me straight? I don\u2019t think so. Would it make sense to consider a male solely attracted to \u201cmasculine\u201d females gay? Again, I don\u2019t think so. That being said, there words which can be used to further specify sexual orientation such as androsexual, gynosexual, etc. which on their own, imply bisexuality yet aren\u2019t true sexual orientations themselves.",

Just remember that they think it's for your own good.\n\nInstead that talk will remain in your mind as one of the most cringiest moments of your life, you'll be remembering it for decades.\n\nSource: I had 'the talk'.\n\nAlso a tip: Lock your door at all times, even when not masturbating.

Nothing wrong with it.  Its just a kink.\n\nYou're almost certainly going to be fine.  Don't worry about it.  I can't say for 100%, but if your dad was in the military, he's seen a *LOT* weirder.",

I used to want to tell my friends things hoping they would help me feel like it was no big deal. But if you're a young person it could be a big mistake. They may make you feel more shame around it. As I've gotten older I've been able to inherit a very \"fuck what other people think attitude\" and my friends are the same.

My dad was in the military so he's pretty tough and will probably get over this. However, for some odd reason I think this might just be more traumatizing than watching your own friends die in combat.\n\nI fucking hate myself and want to die. My friends are gonna bully me so hard if I tell them, and yet I feel like I need to confess about what happened. I think I can take being bullied by Reddit.\n\nBisexuality has its cons, and one of those are being caught watching futanari girls by your dad. \n\nTLDR; Got caught watching hentai chicks with dicks, and I might get disowned.\n\nFeel free to copy and paste.",

There's no such thing as normal anyway cause pretty much everybody has something. Though a lot of people are afraid to be ridiculed or shunned so they hide what makes them different/special.\n\nSo we have a whole society pretending to be normal to remain 'socially acceptable' despite the fact that most individuals are okay with accepting weirdness. But as a group suddenly everybody is afraid of everybody else and the cycle continues.\n\nWe need weirdness acceptance. And by extension we also need acceptance of people with autism and ADHD - cause those people are also considered weird by society even though they can't help it or even hide it!",

A classic straw man argument.\n\n\"Let me take your argument, grossly exaggerate one part of it and then refute this exaggerated version instead of addressing the original argument\".\n\nBut let me answer this anyway. No we shouldn't start accepting pedophiles because they're goddamn criminals. There's this little thing called **THE LAW** that exists to protect people from harm, and pedophiles are harmful and dangerous and therefore shouldn't be accepted. It's not a hard concept.\n\nA kid Naruto running through the street or that guy with a trenchcoat and a fedora reading manga or even that guy jerking off to a cartoon might be 'weird' but definitely not harmful so mind your own business.",

Internet made it super easy, but before that there were pornographic TV channels, before them there were magazines, before them there were erotic photographs and even before them there was erotic literature or paintings. And peeping of course, that was always available.\n\n\r  \nThe point is that teenagers are human, and humans have a sex drive that inconveniently develops during (and because of) puberty.\n\nDenying the fact that 15 years olds can be horny just because they're not 18 is just ridiculous. Nature doesn't care for law or social norms. And trying to stop horny people from masturbating is completely counter productive. Sex drive is one of the basic human needs and won't go away just because you want it to.\n\nThat's why sexual education is so important, and why kinkshaming or even shaming anything sex related, even the 'normal stuff' is so bad.\n\nBecause shaming someone for having something that's actually completely natural is extremely damaging psychologically. It can lead to low self-esteem, self hate, depression, suicidal thoughts etc. This is especially true if it happens to someone young (little experience in dealing with such things) and even more so during puberty - when the body and mind go through crucial changes.\n\nThis can have lasting detrimental effects on the person.",

I\u2019m a little bit bisexual and for that reason I might be able to understand what makes you eager to watch that kind of porn - it\u2019s the best of both worlds kind of thing, eh? Let\u2019s be lighthearted about this. Sexuality is a spectrum. Don\u2019t be ashamed. Don\u2019t blame yourself for being bisexual and expressing your sexuality with this obscure outlet. As long as you  are not watching super violent rape/snuff porn I think you are in the clear lol. When you are ready you can provide Pops with some literature on bisexuality. Or if you don\u2019t feel comfortable you don\u2019t ever have to mention it again. It\u2019s up to you. Again, please do not feel ashamed for being bisexual. It\u2019s very very normal, natural and healthy.",

It\u2019s about transparency and idealism, living under conditions that require you to be as honest to yourself as you are to others, rather than being very two-faced. \n\nOf course countless people have things they\u2019re ashamed of, but it would be a horrible mentality to justify things based on how many people do them. That would be like saying \u201cof course I can be racist, everyone treats these guys badly!\u201d It certainly wasn\u2019t okay even though it was what almost everyone did back then. \n\nThe idea is to try and have less to be ashamed of. It sounds like bad advice because it\u2019s so much easier to be a horrible person than a good one. Easier to lie than to be honest, easier to gossip than to be respectful, easier to manipulate than to be transparent\u2014, you get the point. If it\u2019s not something that you\u2019d ever want others to know of due to impending incredible personal shame, you should reconsider why you are doing it, for your own sake. \n\nThe reason I say that it is not the best advice is because it has situational exceptions that can vary a lot. I\u2019m not giving a golden rule of life or some moral of religion. It is not perfect, but it certainly does make you reflect and think more before you do stuff, which is never a bad thing.",

And the upside of that is that your Dad probably does too so he's got some perspective.\n\nRemember, futa porn is more specialist than anyone would probably want to know about their kids but it's not guro or anything; beyond embarassment, there's no need for actual *shame*.  Does your Dad know you're bi?  \n\nI would work on the assumption that your Dad isn't going to tell your Mum because, eh, that's a weird one to phrase and I think most Dads, ultimately, want to be a bro to their kids.  So don't worry your head about that.\n\nAlso for fuck's sake don't tell your friends if you're that embarrassed by it.  It probably won't help, beyond getting you so relentlessly teased that eventually you're numb to it.  Just remember that your friends, also, will have shit like that that they don't tell you about.",

My mind is boggled every time I read some story on here about getting caught having sex or jerking off. \n\nIn the 90s, it might make a little more sense because the only option was the family desktop computer.

It is prime adult bonding material and rather funny. \n\nWhen I was your age ... dun dun dun ... I had to sit through a family event where I were the only one with the internetz at home. Family apparently seen some porn somewhere, on some other computer and were really confused about terms and categories used. Of course they all asked me at dinner and all I remember is a question about how to tell oral and anal apart (we are not English, they seen it in English) and I did explain. My mum was mortified and my gran (whose sister asked the question) was too amused. Also made it worse by asking if oral is same as french (and I made it worse by knowing history of the term. In case anyone is curious - used to mean oral but nowadays it is snogging). Might have also had a monologue about the term frottage and my hate for it. My family is of course on the conservative side of things and the dinner was after church :| .",

      "text": "> However, for some odd reason I think this might just be more traumatizing than watching your own friends die in combat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGrab some perspective. Your father was a young man once, and if he had arms at the time, then he masturbated. It's entirely possible that he still does, but anyways. While your father might not get futanari (I'm a 48 year old man and I admit I don't see the draw, but so what) he caught his son wanking. Did you get someone pregnant? No. Did you force yourself on your prom date? No. You did what every teenaged boy does. Some are doing it right now, hopefully not while reading this, but still. Your dad got a reminder that he has a teenage son.\n\nDon't bother telling your friends unless someone else clearly brings up 'returning to your first love'. But look at your friends and realize that they also 'root for the Yankees' every chance they get. Recognize that having the internet in your bedroom is like having a filing cabinet filled with a virtually limitless  supply of every single type of porn out there.\n\nIf your dad takes a break and thinks about it for a sec, he's probably relieved that you wank it to some weird looking cartoons. Imagine having a kid who was into violent, nonconsensual type scenarios. Cartoons are relatively harmless. Nobody ever manipulated someone into drawing something that they regretted in the morning. (Hardly ever, but my point remains)\n\nThe takeaways:\n\n1. Keep it in perspective, you're not a freak.\n2. Your dad already knew you masturbated. Because you're a teenage son.",

They were also once (or still are, but that's especially weird to think about) at the same age as us, likely doing the same things as us.\n\nThe only difference is that we are lucky/cursed enough to have an endless supply of goodies a keystroke away, thanks to the internet.\n\nSo, while they may have been walked in on before, we have the horror of parents or someone else walking in and SEEING just what we were thinking about. They will KNOW exactly what you're doing and there's no escaping that fact.\n\n\nI don't know if that helps at all, but if I was your dad, I'd pretend I saw nothing, and never mention it again. What you do, and your fetishes, is your business and something that you deal with. And that's okay, I think.\n\nI hope things just... Work out!",
