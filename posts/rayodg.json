Amy Corey Barrett and Bill Barr were devout followers of fringe offshoot Catholic sects that you rarely ever hear about except when these political figures get appointed to office by Republicans. You also have plenty of end times Evangelicals in top positions like Pompeo that prioritized Christian values and dominance over everything else.\n\nOf course, right wingers now act like Biden and his administration are the worst ever when it comes to religious \"freedom\" (aka hegemony) since Biden is a traditional Catholic that keeps his faith to himself and doesn't actively try to impose a narrow set of Christian religious values for political gain. It's insane that we are discussing this as an issue when they are staunchly defending one of the most morally bankrupt and personally anti or non-religious leaders in modern U.S. history simply because he let them do whatever they wanted. \n\nIt makes me wonder if they wouldve been cool with Mao Zedong or Stalin as their leader just while they let them practice their fundamentalist religious beliefs and could get it to square up somehow with a cult of personality that would exist in tandem to worship them (kind of like we have been seeing with the MAGA cult and many devout Christians who seem to have no problem worshipping both at the moment).",

This part of the reason why many far right anti-democratic governments have taken power in many former Soviet bloc Eastern European countries where religion was popular despite decades of Communist sanctions against it.

He also runs a global empire, so yes, he obviously has business ties to Russia.\n\nI am against the political and economic system, and as Trump is an oligarch, I am against him, too.  But I don't think Trump is worse than any other powerful oligarchs.  I think that mostly people don't like him because he said mean things that were considered inappropriate for a president.",

And yes, I'm well aware of what \"the Russians\" did to interfere in the 2016 election.  They implemented a \"pied Piper\" strategy to promote Trump during the primary because they thought he's be easy to run against.  They openly rigged the democratic primary.  They gave Trump his own TV show for like 10 years.  They gave him constant airtime and TV interviews and specials before the general election to promote him because it was good for ratings.  They also built a time machine to influence the writing of the constitution so that Trump could win the election through the electoral college, despite losing the popular vote by 3 million.\n\nLook, Trump won because America is NOT a democracy and because the neoliberal democratic party abandoned the working class, making places like the rust belt competitive.  Trump represents a classic shift to the fascist right after the liberal order fails to address the problems in society.  Blame \"the Russians\" as much as you want, but the fact is that the US is a dying empire and this kind of crap will keep happening unless we address the real problem, which is late-stage capitalism (and US Empire)... which we will NEVER do because \"both\" parties are controlled by corporations.",

Trump basically split the party in half and then took it over.  Divide and conquer.  Trump is a fascist.  The republican party wasn't before him.  Before him, the republican party was hardcore corporate imperialist - close to fascism, sure, but not quite fascist.  Indeed, if you remember back to 2016 primaries, the republicans also tried to rig their own primary.  The leadership wanted to prevent Trump from being the nominee and they did a bunch of things to favor anyone but him, similar to what the democrats did to stop Bernie.  The difference is that the republicans realized that openly rigging their primary would alienate their base, so they stopped trying to rig it, and Trump ended up winning a plurality.  The democrats were more willing to risk alienating their base and you know the rest.  The republicans didn't want Trump because he was crazy, vulgar, crude, corrupt, polarizing and I suspect a few republicans also realized he was a fascist.  They were also afraid he would lose in the general, for all of the reasons I just mentioned.  But they figured they had a better chance of winning the general if they allowed Trump to win the primary than they would have by alienating the plurality that supported Trump in the primaries.  But pay attention to republican party politics - there is still a lot of bad blood with Trump.  Except many of his former detractors are now afraid of him politically, specifically they are afraid of the control he has over his base.  So some of them are less critical now.",

Like I posted - Trump has appeal to the republican base and lots of republicans have sided with him at this point out of fear for their careers.  Liz Cheney is still a Trump critic and now she's being targeted.  This kind of thing inspires fear in other republicans to line up behind Trump or it could be them next.  This is typical of how fascists take control of a party.\n\nAs for republicans destroying democracy in his name... not just in Trump's name.  Republicans have ALWAYS relied on voter suppression.  Seriously, in the last 30 years, how many times have republicans won the popular vote in the general election?  Clinton won in 92 and 96, Bush \"won\" in 2000 because the supreme court appointed him, but he lost the popular vote by 500K to Gore.  In 2004, Bush won the college and the popular vote by about 3 million.  Then Obama won the college and the popular vote in 08 and 12, followed by Clinton winning the popular vote in 2016 but losing the college, followed by Biden winning both in 2020.  Even when republicans win, they still lose the popular vote.  In the last 30 years, they've \"won\" the presidency 3 times, but they've won the popular vote only 1 time - 2004!!!  Republicans do better when fewer people vote and they always have.  They win through the college.  They've always been the voter suppression party and the electoral college is the biggest voter suppression scam there is.  Now, Trump is taking control of the party, primarily through fear.  Most of them will fall into line.  He will attempt to make an example of Liz Cheney and any republicans who don't toe the line.\n\nAs for the impeachment vote over the Jan. 6 Duck Dynasty coup attempt, your numbers are incorrect.  **10 Republicans in the House voted to impeach, and 7 Republicans in the Senate voted guilty.**  Remember, the Senate voted on Feb. 13, 2021.  Biden took office on Jan. 21, 2021.  Remember that the actual trial by Senate happened AFTER Trump was out of office... I suspect the 7 who voted against thought they could vote against him without serious repercussions because his political career was over, but they were wrong and he is still the dominant force in republican politics and actively reshaping the party in his name.\n\nI'm guessing that eventually everyone or nearly everyone in the Republican party will eventually side with Trump.  Even Liz Cheney will probably be forced to back Trump eventually.  She will either toe the line or be forced out.  Trump is a fascist and this is what they do.  Right now Trump is consolidating his control and appointing loyalists so if the election is close in 2024, he can steal it with this fraud nonsense.  The republicans will go along with it to advance and / or keep their own political careers.",

She meddled in the Republican primary by urging the Democrat partisans in the mass media to promote him as a \"pied Pipar\"!  That was a great strategy!  Couldn't possibly backfire.  \n\nCan you prove that \"the Russians\" were behind the wikileaks?  Or that Trump was working with them?\n\nCan you tell me specifically what Trump did and how he was working with \"the Russians\"?\n\nAnd who do you mean by \"you guys\"?  I'm NOT a Trump supporter.  I'm a socialist, and Trump is a fascist.  When fascists get a grip on power, they arrest socialists.  They don't just rig the primaries to prevent weak socialists from winning.  They have us arrested.  If Trump becomes a dictator like he apparently wants to (and I DO believe he wants to become a dictator, though I have no evidence), I end up in a camp.\n\nMy problem with you Russiagaters is that instead of passing legislation that will actually fix the problems in our nominal democracy, you'd rather blame \"the Russians\" or stupid voters or Bernie Bros or Jill Stein or whoever for not backing the democrats.  Why don't you give us a reason to vote for you?\n\nIt's very simple: if you want people to vote for democrats, appeal to the working class and the bottom half of the middle class.\n\nI will vote for Biden in 2024 if he gives me the Public Option that the democrats have been promising.  Obama promised a public option in 2008 and 2012, didn't deliver.  Biden promised it in 2020, hasn't delivered yet.  What I really want is Single Payer, but I'll vote for democrats if they can give me a public option.  Think of it as a hostage negotiation.  You need to send out a hostage first as a show of good faith.  That hostage can be the public option.  I'll still push for Single Payer, but I'll vote democrats if they give me the Public Option.\n\nRight now, I'm convinced that democrats are against the kind of socialized healthcare that every single other developed country has.  Prove me wrong and I'll vote for Biden in 2024.\n\nBut I don't care about this Russia nonsense.  You've been harping on \"the Russians\" for like 5 years and nothing serious has come from it.  You want to know who REALLY influences US elections?  Freaking corporations!  Corporate control of \"our\" government is a far bigger issue than the invisible Russians sleeping under Trump's bed with their invisible pee tapes and their rainbow Bernie Sanders facebook memes.  This whole Russia nonsense is just a distraction from real issues and economic problems.\n\nGive me a Public Option and I'll vote democrat again (the last time I voted democrat was in 2004 for Kerry, been voting 3rd party ever since... but hey, at least I don't vote for Republicans, right?).",

I mean, yeah, Trump was terrible, but when you're talking about US Empire and the behavior and policies of the oligarchs who control it, the bar is pretty damn low.

Apparently JFK used to photograph himself naked with prostitutes.  Clinton flew the \"Lolita express\" nearly 30 times... of course, Trump was also a pal with Epstein.  Point is, it's a low bar.",

Trust me, those Johnson's Johnson stories actually happened - lots of journalists actually witnessed this stuff, as opposed to the ethereal \"Russian pee tapes\" and other nonsense.  Moreover, most of the Johnson stories came out after he left office and his political career was over, so they aren't politically motivated like the Russia stories.\n\nIn truth, I think \"both\" parties are terrible, and every presidential nominee from either party during my lifetime has been terrible.  I want more than a 2 party system and I refuse to play in the 2 party system.  I generally vote for the Green Party (I know, I know - I'm the reason Trump \"won\" in 2016 despite losing by 3 million votes).  \n\nBut here's the deal:  I'll gladly vote for the democrats in 2024 if Biden makes good on his promise for a Public Option (I'd prefer Single Payer - but P.O. is a start).\n\nYou're not going to win me over with this Russiagate stuff, but I'll vote for democrats if you give me public healthcare, even if it's only a public option (I greatly prefer medicare for all, but I'll settle for a public option).  OK?  Public Option and I'll start supporting democrats again.  That gives you 1 more year (I'm assuming the dems will lose big in the midterms, so you have 1 year to get a public option before the republicans shut down the house and senate.  1 year for a public option if you want my vote).  If I don't get my Public Option, then I'm going to vote for the Green Party again, the Greens will get 1% of the vote again, the dems will lose the presidential election again, probably through the electoral college BS, and we're all going to get stuck with Trump again!  You have 1 year!!!  Public Option.",

So was every single president the US has ever had, even Jimmy Carter (overthrowing democratic governments, supporting dictatorships, etc.).  I'm glad things got a little better for black people under Johnson, but he was still a monster.\n\nThe US is an Empire, and it's always been ruled by evil men.

Essentially, it would single handedly destroy America in a number of ways if we cut ties to the kingdom. The US dollar would lose value like crazy, job cuts would be in the 100,000s and devastate whole regions in our nation and then on top of that Oil(what our economy currently relies on) scarcity will devastate us.\n\nObama made good steps to push Electric Cars with Tesla and credits, on top  also opening up new oil extraction sectors like fracking which dipped world demand and increased American self-reliance, Trump followed suit and thankfully we have become less dependent on the kingdom and are leading the world in Electric Vehicles which will soon make Oil obsolete.\n\n\\*EDIT\\* Biden is following suit by pouring investments and encouraging ALL motor vehicle manufacturers to start launching an electric fleet. Honestly it's a fantastic direction our nation is headed in. After which we can tell Saudi Arabia to go fuck itself lol\n\nRemember, we live in a Democracy, US presidents have to keep their people happy and secured, that's what makes us so great. All presidents are actively incentivized to do this, and therefore they can't make such quick, emotional decisions without considering the massive repercussions. It sucks we have to wait, but I'm sure within 10 to 15 years as we begin expanding Electric vehicles into industrial sector as well, it'll be over for oil.",

But they still won't take care of those children that are born and not wanted. They will state they help, but they don't help them all. Mostly, just some white children. This is my opinion and it's worth almost nothing. They want a lot of children so they can try to convert them to \"their\" faith so they can get more donations. It's all about them.",
