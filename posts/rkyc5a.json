When you use an exception you don't disprove a generalization. Humanity managed to survive long enough to invent formula, only a minority of women *need* to use formula. Formula is a con because far too many families are spending far too much money on it unnecessarily. Again, nowhere did I say that formula is *useless*, only that it is a *con*. You should read about the amazing cons the formula companies have pulled in Africa. Real Nestl\u00e9-style shit.\n\nLikewise, circumcision is a con because most baby boys don't need to be mutilated.

No. We are now to blame for the developing world's total refusal to take self-governance seriously - resulting in poor nutrition and the empowerment of corrupted non-liberal regimes everywhere non-western citizenry were allowed access to global markets. This is Bill Gates's angle - he pretends to be helping these people in order to have an excuse to deliver bribes to their itinerant leaders - often these leaders themselves imposed on these regions by globalists - who, again, will blame working class westerners for all of this.\n\nIn short, what we called civilization was incompatible with the goals of globalists (smaller populations made up of people willing to suffer and sacrifice) - so that civilization has been destroyed - manifesting in allegedly 'pro-human' political factions that celebrate euthanasia and eugenics in defense of an international economic status quo hell-bent on world domination via totalitarian technocratic bullshit, like eugenics, and all of course 'for our own good'.",

They mostly fence it on Amazon - where it looks totally legit next to thousands of identical legit items.\n\nThey just price it a little lower usually so it moves fast. Its all profit for them.\n\nThere is a whole world of journalism and articles out there specifically about organized baby formula theft.\n\nIn USA it is done by the usual suspects. In australia, it is done by Chinese people who sell it in China where it is very expensive apparently.\n\nDo you know how blackmarkets function? They do not come up to you on a street corner to fence their goods. They sell them back into the mainstream markets wherever possible, and places like amazon make it a cinch.\n\nThe DAs and LEO in big cities are allowing this to develop into a full on closet industry in the name of 'fighting white supremacy'.",

Stop insisting anyone who wants to discuss labor rights in relationship to current geopolitical realities, for instance, is talking about your favorite human shields, as opposed to, say, the enormous global status quo made up of only a tiny minority of Jewish people.\n\nYou are ignorant.

I consider YOU a danger to the Jewish people, and all people for that matter. STOP. Stop dragging jewish people into these topics as a human shield. It will be YOUR fault when some nutter actually does do what you are desperately trying to insist I may do - which I assure you - I am prepared to stand by in defense of Jewish individuals if you morons finally foment the attacks you spend your time attempting to foment.\n\nFor every person like me who is pro-labor, anti-globalist - and wants everyone to thrive, from Jews to Palestinians to everyone else - you immediately insisting on dragging Jews into it, is easy to refute.

There is no more markets in the age of Amazon. They never had to make a profit. They just had to absorb everything while being kept afloat by the investment-globalist class.\n\n It is the total and complete monopolization of everything - in a final blending of state and multinational corporation even W.

What we are seeing is\\\\has been the total end of market capitalism as a global planned economy is grafted on top of our world - in the form of Amazon and so on.\n\nAmazon seeks profits the way the US military functions to 'protect americans' - if it happens, it happens, but the real goal is to remove profits from other people - namely western citizens who need to be destroyed completely to maske way for the casual indentured servitude of the Chinese-style social contract the globalist-left and neocon-right want to force on us.",

The 'too big to fail' economics of globalism are opposed to mom n pop even existing - let alone being 'made whole' when globalist-organized, fed and bailed-out crime gangs descend upon them.\n\nYou keep believing the globalists care about profits. They do not. They have control of all monetary supply and policy, and all watchdogs and media.\n\nAnd no globalist does not mean Jews. It means globalists - which come in every single human form. Insisting on conflating globalism, the neoliberal economic and social policy of the entire global status quo, with the tiny and legitimately vulnerable Jewish people is abject anti-semitism of the most boorish and common variety.",

Newborns eat like every 2 hours during the first month or two, so the mom is not going to be able to feed the child even working part time.   \n\n\nAlso, these corporations try to get you hooked on formula even before the child is born, my wife got sent a pack of formula at like 3 months pregnant.   \n\n\nAnother thing is the foreskin, why cut that shit out and have to deal with taking care of the wound on a tiny child, instead of just keeping it natural and not making their newborn child suffer? It's like people make things worse for themselves thinking that they're choosing a more convenient way.",

Even if you let poor kids die like flies, poor people will still have kids. \n\nCase in point, look at the developing world. It's full of poor people, has a higher child mortality rate, **still has a higher fertility rate than the developed world.**\n\nBut you probably didn't know that, because you've never pulled head your ass to look around.\n\nAlso, why should kids die because of their parents? Do you value human life so little that you're willing to let children die so parents learn their lesson? Even though it probably won't even work anyway?\n\nYou clearly weren't bullied enough as kid since you can't empathize with the suffering of children.",

Reportedly, they stole around $2.5 million in baby formula alone from Safeway stores until they were busted by the police in 2010.\n\n-MSN",
