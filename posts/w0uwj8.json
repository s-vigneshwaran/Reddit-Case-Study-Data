This scenario is assuming that the floor is wet because of a spill. But you can\u2019t leave the sign up forever.\n\nIf the floor is wet from regular cleaning, the sign reduces the chance of a slip & fall by putting people on notice and thereby a lawsuit. Though if someone slips there is always option 2 below.\n\n2. It may be cheaper for a store to settle a slip & fall claim than to defend a suit in litigation. If the injured person is asking for $8,000 but it would cost $10,000 to defend, it is cheaper to settle. Regardless of the outcome of the litigation. I\u2019m guessing this happened to you.",

Insurance companies defend and pay these settlements/ judgments and they have contractual obligations to their insureds to limit their exposure. The costs have to be evaluated on the individual level for that reason. Plus, general damages like pain & suffering or a chiro report stating that a client sprained their lumbar spine are hard to dispute and win complete verdicts against. Especially in states like Florida that have pure comparative negligence laws. In those states, someone who is 99% at fault can still file suit against another party for their 1% contribution.\n\nEdit: Important to know that the insurance company makes the decision to settle. Not the insured.",

Shitty reasoning, but people can be pretty oblivious. When I worked fast food I used to put the wet floor signs right in front of the door where people would have to walk around them to enter or leave, that way they couldn't use the excuse of \"I didn't see it\".",

      "text": "This is how I almost killed a lady and her new born.  \n\nI used to shovel snow off of roofs where I live which is very common practise in our town, during winter every side walk will be temporarily closed off due to heavy snow/ice falling.  \n\nOne 5 story house we had was on a very tight street and sight was very limited, so we blocked the side walk with fence, signs and warning tape with one man positioned opposite the entrance. There were a lot of cars and the house leaked a lot of heat (equals a lot of ice) so we protected the cars with boards.  \n\nNow most adult people living here have grown up knowing the danger and will go over to the other side of the street. However. That day there was a lot of snow, and we had just dislodged a huge chunk of ice easily 60+kg - way too thick for us to break with the tools we had. So 2 of us had our shovels under the chunk and were slowly trying to push it over the edge and not hit the cars below.  \n\nThe moment it it got to the point of no return we heard the sharp shriek of the whistle from below signaling us to stop, I saw the ice sliding over the edge and my heart fell with it. If someone gets hit by that they're 100% dead, even a showel of wet snow can kill from that height if you're unlucky. And then we heard the thump with a crash, we had obviously hit something. And then a woman started screaming and a child crying.  \n\nWhat happened was that this woman was walking with a strolley, moved our blocking fence, pushed her strolley and herself under our waist high tape onto a side walk that was filled with freshly shoveled snow and ice chunks. She had done so behind a van with a board which is why our street guard caught her so late, but his whistle stopped her and the chunk hit and destroyed her strolley. Luckily she was carrying her child. She was furious, my guard was furious, I was just glad I hadn't killed anyone.  \n\nThat was easily my most valuable lesson in never underestimating the amazing stupidity of humans.",

What about the third one, get them on their feet?\n\nOther countries have dealt with homelessness positively, without housing them in hotels or greenlighting them living in tents. \n\n>Homeless people that other states were literally sending to them btw\n\nNo, it's homelessness flocking to LA, because that's where they know they can get away with what they do. The people go there on their own, and not to improve their lives but to actually get away with their bullshit.\n\nI just think it's great that the best solution is letting them remain sick, and have no desire to help people live happier, more fulfilling lives",

Biden crime bill/Brady bill led to higher crime rates, more gun violence, and the imprisonment of non-violent black people. Continuous interference in the medicine industry going back to the 80s is what inflated medicine so much that it can cause debilitating debt. Same goes for the education sector. Like all the problems democrats are talking about are caused by democrats.\n\nRepublican topics generally are non-existent issues, like immigration, which is sad imo. That being said, at least it's not a self imposed wound.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Democrat policy is that they can accurately point out problems while promoting the dumbest solutions. Here's my analogy of democrats: you shot yourself in the foot and so you ask the doctor to reset your shoulder. That's how every Democrat policy has played out for the impoverished communities I grew up in.",

To prove a point. Guy 1 Can grab the flat board and turn 180 to the left \n\nslap the shit out of the guy who's more interested in what the carts are up to. Just keep smacking him, with all you're rage.  until caution stand breaks. \n\nok np.\n\ngrab guy who now beat up is passed out, throw him in spot of wet floor where guy 1 fell.\n\nNobody else will fall, lady won't move new caution stand out of way.
