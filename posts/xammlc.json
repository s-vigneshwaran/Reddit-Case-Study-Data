  "text": "TIFU using shrooms in front of my gf\nYesterday my gf agreed to be my trip sitter. I like shrooms and usually I'm a 2g shroom guy, but yesterday I wanted to see what 4g would do. I asked my gf to be my trip sitter just in case I decided to Peter Pan off the balcony or something. At the time my gf seemed really keen. She even joked about getting popcorn, which she actually did. \n\nShe ran out of popcorn more or less the same time she ran out of enthusiasm. I spent most of the night doing an invisible hula hoop dance and laughing hysterically. The higher dose definitely hit different. My gf said it was getting late and wanted us to go to bed. We ended up in bed and my gf eventually fell asleep. I was still wide awake and unable to stop touching my Adam's apple every time I swallowed. \n\nMy gf woke up to me standing on the bed completely naked and continuing to do the invisible hula hoop dance. She grabbed a blanket and left the bedroom. I have no idea how long I was dancing on the bed, but I must have exhausted myself and passed out because I remembered nothing else afterwards other than waking up alone in bed this morning and finding my gf sleeping in the living room. \n\nWhen my gf opened her eyes, I was standing by with breakfast and an apology, which my gf was grateful for. However, she broke up with me. Last night was \"too much frat boy\" for her liking. Apparently she expected an \"older guy\" like me to be more mature. I'm 22. She's 19. What the fuck. Anyway, she left. I really liked her. \n\nTL:DR Got high in front of my gf and she left me.",

However when BOOZE is put into any sort of mix, or if drank alone in huge quantities, since I never drink hard liquor , maybe, I gor SO frightened when my ex used to drink copious amounts of booze and he would change in front of me. I felt really put upon , he would black out, start hollering nonsense , stagger around, i had to ALWAYS hide the car keys. Sometimes he drove off and i would spend the night by the phone waiting desperately , praying he was not picked up for drunk driving AGAIN, or worse, dead on the highway, or a road somewhere. He is an ex, but as much as I LOVED him and a sober him loved me, even though he quit drinking w AA finally, I could no longer live like that. I felt as if I was the asshole, but I was in my 20s and NOT psychiatrically prepared.",

It doesn't even have to dramatic or super obvious - in fact, I think it bothers me more when people are quietly high and trying to play it off legit.

They'd all act like they were fine, nothing to see here, totally not using again - and it's like being constantly gaslit. \n\nI have a good friend who uses medicinal marijuana all the time now and we don't hang out anymore. I just don't enjoy being around people who are in altered states. (I'm also deathly allergic to pot, so there's that.) It makes me sad though. I get why they need it (intractable nausea, frequent vomiting) but I don't enjoy talking to someone that spaces out mid-thought.",

I don't care that he's disabled, it doesn't change how much I respect and admire his strength, his ability to have endured his hard life and not let it change him into a bitter, angry and violent man and still have empathy and compassion.

Could you give me a different example than the post? You said it was a minefield, can you give me an idea of some other potential mines? (You just edited your comment and told me to go look for them, but you're the one asserting they exist and that they're trivial. If you can't tell me, then I'll just say I looked for them and they don't exist) \n\n2. Should a woman stay in a relationship with a man she doesn't want to date just because you think her reason for wanting to break up isn't sufficiently serious?\n\nRegarding your statement above, sometimes you do your best and the other person isn't vibing with it and doesn't want to date you. That's fine. That's what dating is for - to see if you like one another, to get a feel for whether you want to stay with that person. People rarely get answers about the \"whys\" when you're only 1-3 dates in, because it's rude and unhelpful and largely just comes down to \"I don't want to\". Why should they have to date someone they don't want to just because you are \"nice\"?\n\nAre you talking about dating or dating apps specifically? Is your issue that men don't get matched on dating apps (so women should do what instead?) or that they get broken up with for small reasons (which you don't think should be allowed even though you can't tell me one example other than a woman disliking how her boyfriend behaved on drugs)?",

Why would you want to date someone you can't disagree with for fear she'd dump you? Life does have its ups and downs. Invest in someone who will support you through them, and who *wants to do so*. \n\nAnd why should a young woman have to stay with a man she doesn't want to date, just because he disagrees with her reasons for feeling that way? Why should she have to talk it out with a guy she doesn't want to date, when she could, as you pointed out, move onto another person she might like better?\n\nWhat do you want women do to about the swiping disparity? If the average girl has 100 guys swiping on her every day, why is it wrong for her to pick her number 1 guy, the one she likes the absolute best? Why should she settle for less because a man thinks she's flaky for not dating him? \n\nCan I ask how old you are? I think this can influence views a lot (for transparency, I am 24).",

I'm in a very happy relationship myself. I'd say I picked the best guy, and he picked me, and we are building something together. It's mutual. \n\nYou say \"find someone and made it work together\" but I guarantee you that \"back then\" women also broke up with men for little reasons, like, oh, **not wanting to build a relationship with them** - and if they didn't do so, it was because they weren't allowed to.\n\n I come from a country where divorce was not legal until after I was born and not socially acceptable until I was in my teens. I have seen so many relationships where people just found someone else and built something and didn't let go, even when it was bad, even when they desperately wanted to, because their reasons weren't good enough, because the man wasn't *bad* even if he wasn't their idea of *best*, because women were capricious and flighty and didn't have the backbone to build actual long-lasting relationships if they kept relying on their ~emotions~ for guidance. It was shit. A lot of women in my community were desperately unhappy. \n\nI think if someone doesn't want to date you, they shouldn't have to. I don't think that should be controversial. \n\nI'm 24 years old. I've done the dating apps (more fun for girls hotter than me, but had my fair share of dates off it), I've done the club thing, I have my boyfriend now. I've broken up with guys for silly reasons 2 dates in, and they've broken up with me for similar. I've been ghosted (tried not to ghost myself unless necessary). I've had dates turn into really good friends when things didn't work out. Dating is messy and hinges on emotion and abstract feelings of attraction and good vibes and it's rarely something you can make rules for except that you should try and make yourself happy and try not to make others unhappy. \n\nBut no one owes anyone else a relationship. Even if you think their reasons for that are silly. \n\n I'm sorry you're finding it hard, but I think shitting on young women today is not the answer.",

I\u2019m saying that our values, the way that we evaluate people, possibly the things that we look for early on, might be wrong. We might not be realizing that there are more important things to look for, or to put in the time to build. \n\nThe big thing I come back to is the dating app statistics, they\u2019ve been shown to be consistent over various apps. The majority of women are going for a very small minority of guys. That doesn\u2019t work. Ultimately it will lead to a group of women who later in life are bitter because they have been mistreated by this group of guys that have all the options, but they\u2019ll be used to that caliber of guy and they don\u2019t want to settle for \u2018less\u2019 or are never really happy when they do, or they do and are but it\u2019s past those prime fertility years or they\u2019ve already had kids with those guys. \n\nAnd then there\u2019s a group of guys, the unwanted ones, that just don\u2019t really get much if they aren\u2019t at the top, and who\u2019s options only start to open up once they are older, and get with the women I\u2019ve just described. \n\nThis is cynical sounding but it\u2019s happening. I\u2019ve personally opted out of dating because of it. I\u2019m a middle of the road kinda guy. Intelligent, good career, been through a lot in life that\u2019s given me a wide perspective and empathy, and contrary to this heavy discussion, I like to be light and joke around in person. But I don\u2019t seem to have that whatever it is that gets me noticed by women. I\u2019m short so maybe that has something to do with it. Lol. \n\nIt\u2019s tough and I really think that dating has fundamentally changed within a generation in a way that it never has before. It\u2019s going to take time to see how it plays out.",

I was convinced I was stuck in that moment of time in some alternate reality hell so I didn\u2019t see the harm in smashing things for fun. I had no fucking idea what was going on.

My kid is chronically ill, best friends marriage is shaky at the moment, another friend is worried for the rising costs of living, BIL lost both parents in just three years etc. \n\nFor us it really has been more or less \"traditional\" in the sense that we grew up and life is getting much tougher / worrisome.

Then put the rice and spores in the jar. Once it spreads (a couple of weeks in a dark place) shake it up and put it back for a couple more weeks. Once it's completely covered with the mold it's time for the substrate. Use boiling water to hydrate and sterilize your coconut fiber(found at pet stores). Then after letting it cool, break up the rice and mix it in. Then you just kind of wait, keep it damp, and fan the air every day or two. Then you have mushrooms.\n\nTo get the spores I recommend going to duck duck go and asking for Ralph.",

Yeah, that\u2019s fine, I don\u2019t care really. I COULD tell her to just deal, absolutely, but it\u2019s not like the way I do dishes is a fundamental part of my identity and the way I move through life, so why not just do them differently and make her happy if I don\u2019t care that much?\n\nNow, there are things where you absolutely have to tell your partner to deal, like your game example, and if they can\u2019t they can\u2019t. You have to decide for yourself what is negotiable and what isn\u2019t, and even in the negotiable things how much change you\u2019re willing to put up with. \n\nTo bring it back to OP\u2019s example, maybe mushrooms are something that they were just doing out of boredom every now and then and they wouldn\u2019t really care that much if they never do them again. Or maybe they really truly value the psychedelic experience and have strong a desire to continue using them and would feel like they were truly comprising who they are to give them up. Neither of these are right or wrong, but it\u2019s up to the individual to decide what is important to them, who they are, and what they are or aren\u2019t willing to sacrifice to make a relationship work.",

Shroom trips take like around six hours total from ingestion to peak tripping to lucidity. I'm wondering if OP decided to take the shrooms too late in the evening, which is poor planning since he should know how long a shroom trip lasts since he has done smaller quantities before. Shroom trips do not decrease in duration for smaller doses, the effects are just less strong. Shrooms can also make it very difficult to go to sleep, even after the person is lucid (but at that point OP would be fine to go be awake by himself and let his girlfriend sleep).",

By the third day, it of course wasn't working anymore (tolerance builds up super fast), but I kept popping tabs in hopes it would eventually kick in.  By mid-morning I'd had about 8 or 10 tabs and I was laying on the beach when a friend handed me their weed vape.  I took one hit and the weed kicked everything into gear and all those tabs hit all at once.  I started walking toward the ocean and my entire field of vision was just melting; it felt/looked like reality was fracturing all around me and \"the simulation\" was breaking.  But the water felt fucking amazing.  I ended up wandering to the other side of the island away from the party where nothing had been built up yet and hardly anyone was swimming just so I could have 0 distractions from the blissful feeling of floating in that water in the middle of nowhere.

We stood on the board walk and the clouds were just zooming across the sky chasing each other. Then I tried eating a giant turkey leg and couldn't stop laughing. Bought a cup and drink and the lady handed me a lid only for me to stare at it then ask what this was for.\n\nNext riding the manta (roller coaster laying on your stomach) was amazing and made me feel like a super hero. The thought of I could die just made me laugh nonstop for whatever reason lol. Then on the penguin ride I reached over the enclosure and petted one which was surprisingly warm and fluffy like a dog even tho it was in super cold water. Great time.",

In reality I'd say probably no more than an hour or so because I don't actually know how to float on my back and was upright keeping my head afloat with my legs, so assume I'd have gotten tired of that at some point.  I think I also spent some time in shallower water just sitting.  But the sun was still plenty high when I got out and I know they didn't let us stay too late on the island.\n\nRest of day was great and pretty wild.  I found my friends again and laid next to them in the beach chairs for a while \"dancing\" with just my hands (like gloving . . . without gloves).  I finally accepted being nonbinary after questioning for several months prior and told my friend \"I think I'm nonbinary\".  He just looked over like I'd said the most obvious thing ever and told me something like \"You didn't know?  You packed a suitcase full of dresses.\"  That's a cherished memory.  I think I also spent some time dancing on the beach with my leviwand.\n\nOn the little ferry back from the island to the ship, I met a wealthy business owner in his 40s who was very clearly just starting to experience his first ever trip and loving it but had been isolated from his friend/employee that gave him the dose.  So I took it upon myself to help him out and then he got kinda attached to me and was telling me he'd fly me out to Washington to live with him and such and I had to gently decline because I knew all his emotions were just in overdrive.  He was fun to hang out with though.  I got him back to his room safely and returned him to his friend.  We're still friends on fb I think and he did actually message me later still offering to fly me out to Washington lol.\n\nI was still tripping by evening I think and had a lot of fun dancing with various flow props on the deck; people kept letting me borrow their LED whips, capes, whatever to watch me dance which made me happy because it was too windy for my leviwand.  That was kinda every night though; the whole festival kinda is blurred together in my memory at this point.",

We told him dude had sold us bunk tabs and the first guy just sort of bashfully looked around like he felt bad. The second dude then pulled out a vial and told us to tilt our heads back and open our mouths. We looked at each other and were like eh fuck it here goes lol. He proceeded to squirt straight LSD into our mouths, like who knows how many hits. Needless to say a few songs into second set we had gone completely insane. We noped the fuck out of the show and spent the next 12 hours locked in our apartment laughing like maniacs and trying to find our brains again. Good times.",

I finally told my friends that I might be having some issues, so my gracious host went to go get something to drink/eat that might help me calm down. My other friend decided he should go help. When he saw a jug of milk on the ground (assuming it had fallen from the fridge) and attempted to put it back in the full fridge my host told him to piss off. It was at this moment a bit of chemistry 101 snuck back into my friends head. \n\u201cWe\u2019re on acid. Milk is a base. BASES NEUTRALIZE ACIDS!!! This should help my friend calm down!\u201d \nWhen they brought me the jug I was hesitant, especially when I smelled it and could tell something wasn\u2019t right. \n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d I asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s milk. It\u2019ll help.\u201d\nI love milk, so I took a nice deep gulp. Only to be greeted by what I would later find to be spent cooking oil. It was disgusting. I lick eyes with friend.\n\u201cWhat the fuck did I just drink?\u201d\nWe touch the rim and (everyone in the house being cooks) have a pretty good idea, but I\u2019m taking no more chances. I run to Host and push the jug into his chest.\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this?\u201d\nTouches rim to feel oil.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI just drank it.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re okay\u201d\n\u201cWHAT *IS* IT?\u201d\n\u201cSpent cooking oil.\u201d\nMy friend was on a septic tank and religiously refused to pour oil down the drain.\n\nAfter convincing my friends the best thing for me would be to watch my favorite show at the time, Rick and Morty, I calmed down and assumed by daybreak I was mostly sober, so when my friend needed to leave for class, I figured now was the best time to drive home. BOY was I mistaken. I had calmed down, but I was still VERY high and it was like driving in a video game. I\u2019m pretty sure the only way I was able to navigate home was because I followed my friend 99% of the way there. Otherwise I\u2019m certain I would have just driven till I was nearly out of gas and realized I needed to stop. My driving was fine, I just lacked any sense of where I was supposed to be going. Still, not my proudest moment.",

First off, I don't really know anyone who trips even somewhat frequently but usually only takes 2 grams. But whatever, maybe.\n\nBut 4 grams will definitely get you tripping, and I don't think I've ever met anyone who felt like dancing much while on shrooms. Definitely not for \"most of the night\". That sounds exactly like what some teenager who hasn't tripped would think sounded like what someone might do. \n\nPlus, saying his girlfriend ran out of enthusiasm when she ran out of popcorn is strange. Tripping so hard that all you're doing is mindlessly dancing, then you're not going to notice when or even if she ran out of enthusiasm. \n\nAnd then at the end, he had enough sense to go to bed with his girlfriend, then got up and started mindlessly dancing again? Not happening. Definitely not on the bed. Even tripping, if you were conversing with your girlfriend before bed, then you'd know enough not to start dancing on the bed. \n\nAnd then saying that after his girlfriend left, he doesn't know what happened, he just woke up the next day. That isn't how tripping works. You don't just black out at the end. And unless you're on some ridiculous bender, then 99 percent of the time there's no way you can fall asleep tripping. What happens is you eventually feel the mushrooms start wearing off, you get your mind back, then you go to sleep. But you remember all of that. \n\nThis was a huge rant, but I get so annoyed at people who just make up drug stories.",

I have much more fun on 2gs of mushrooms than I do on 3.5g or whatever other people decide to take.  \n\nI just find a lower dose much more comfortable and enjoyable. \n\n When it comes to LSD and other lysergamides I'm much more comfortable on a higher dose, for whatever reason my brain just doesn't like to push it too far with mushrooms.",

Generally my no-tolerance minimum dose is around 400ug, I always have a good time on L but shrooms can get a little too body heavy for me and I just feel like I'm made of liquid. I just end up sitting in a chair or laying on the ground having weird thoughts for 4+ hours lol, I've been so still in my chair for so long that I've had strangers at music festivals check on me to make sure I'm ok.

Only wrong way is to take doses so close to each other that you feel no effects and I space em enough (most times) so I do.      \nPersonally I'm not tryna be balls to the wall tripping; else I'd be doing a heroic dose sitting in the dark with my eyes closed.           \nPeople enjoy substances at a variety of doses tailored for themselves and the situation at hand.

Thought shrooms would be fine for him even though he hasn't tried them, right? No. He must have had underlying mental issues or something going on because he took two grams and almost lost it. He wouldn't go to sleep even when the others did, so I had to watch him as I came down. He was overwhelmed by the feeling love, asked to see my vagina because he thought it would show him the key to the universe, then he accidently peed on me. He also tried getting in the shower, calling his dad, and kept calling me a completely different girl's name. The next morning he was mortified when we told him the short version of what happened. He definitely didn't remember most of it, and actually took me for coffee a week later so I could have a \"talk\" with him about his behavior.",

It's not outside realm that could set me into a dark place, it could be as simple as it just \"didn't\" rather than it \"doesn't\" ever affect me.\n\nYour totally right.  Beyond that I personally swear it does a little more than recreational for me, BUT everything about they way I'm saying to do versus what you are suggesting is the difference from recreational use and more moderated HEALTHY, potentially healing experience.  \n\nI'm the one doing it wrong and you're right!

I\u2019ve gone two strips deep, had DMT breakthroughs, and lots of fungus. Y\u2019all, this tea fucking destroyed me. \n\nFifteen minutes in, colors shifted on me hard, my eyes would not converge, I and I was talking to the trip like it was a separate entity. I went from zero to hyperspace with virtually no come-up, and then I had a panic attack.  Ya ever had one?  They\u2019re not fun, especially when in an altered state of mind. I became convinced that somehow a different breed of mushroom had gotten mixed in with these, a poisonous one, and I was going to die in the very immediate future. \n\nFungus is always a tough body load on me, specifically with sporadic muscle spasms. So there I was, freaking out about possibly poisonous penis envies, and the spasms kick in. Welp, full-freak mode activate. I went, woke my beautiful wife up, told her I was dying and proceeded to just lose my shit. She found out what I had taken, went into trip sitter mode, and immediately started distracting me. \u201cOk, we can go to the hospital, but first, did you see that new trailer for (whatever movie was coming out soon)?\u2026\u201d and so on. She did this for Three. Goddamn. Hours.  \n\nOnce I started to shift back to reality, I was able to ride it out with no more issue. She went back to sleep once she was sure I was good and sobering up. Never gave me shit about it, made sure I was still good the next day, and we did our normal post-trip recap we usually do with each other. The trip itself is as definitely my most difficult trip, but it helped me focus more on maintaining my health, and was the catalyst for me quitting smoking. That took a couple tries to stick, but it worked in the end. \n\nAnyway, long, rambling story breaks down to this. Get an experienced trip sitter. Even the most experienced psychonaut can get surprised.",

It was bitter on the tongue, and I stupidly didn\u2019t spit it out, thinking it was just the \u201cink\u201d.  It was (I assume) whatever NBome compound had just come out. The trip was intense and very\u2026 metallic?  Machine-y?  Completely grayscale throughout, and everything was sharp corners and fractals. None of the introspection or oneness with everything, just felt like being trapped in a giant factory for the trip.   I learned to test my shit after that.",

I\u2019ve even seen people addicted to sleeping medical struggle for 30 minutes to put a coat on while tripping on Lunesta before falling over a table because they lacked a sense of depth perception / lacked balance. \n\nI have tripped shrooms and also \u201csat\u201d for trips. Having a sitter who knows how to enhance your trip and calm you down it critical. But honestly there are a lot of similarities between somebody who is blackout drunk and somebody who is tripping on shrooms. If you are not into that type of thing, I wouldn\u2019t want to babysit either of them. To have fun babysitting someone on shrooms you kinda have to fuck with them / put yourself in a child\u2019s imaginative mentality. Like give them a big bag of gummy bears and tell them that the green ones represent good thoughts but the red ones represent bad thoughts. Then sit back and watch them sort the gummy bears lmfao. Or tell them that the floor is made of Lava or that if they step on a crack they will break their mothers back. I mean you literally have to act childish with them. Drunk people are more loose canons emotionally\u2026 but like I said if you\u2019re not into drinking or drugs you won\u2019t have fun babysitting either and they will both look pretty sad and pathetic to you. \n\nIf your big into maturity then I can definitely see how babysitting your boyfriend on shrooms would be a complete dealbreaker.",

There were about 60 festival refugees there all told, and we partied together all weekend, hiking, listening to music, and burning through our party favors. I candy flipped one night with our group, and toward the end of the night, got offered some DMT. We were sitting around a campfire coming back to reality, and the guy who had it did a fantastic job of walking us through the process. I managed to blast off, was\u2026 somewhere else? for a while, felt like eternity. Came back to myself in about 15 minutes, and immediately wanted to go back. Ended up going three times that night, bought a few carts from the dude, and now go about once a month or so. My brain just doesn\u2019t wanna go back more than that.",

Took me like half an hour to explain thay concept which lead me to my next train of thought.\n\n\n2) Best way to describe my thought process to my sitter was that my brain is usually a well organised library, with a reception where I can request any specific memory/thought, and mushrooms had invited a load of bears into my library. They tore off all the labels and fucked up my reception, I could still walk around and pick out books but I didn't know what the book was or where in my library it belonged or why.",

Like, an acid trip can typically last like 8-12 hours depending on dosage, but he was apparently redosing at like the 4 or 5 hour mark. For literally at least a week straight. No sleep. Probably no food, probably little water. Absolutely melted his sense of reality. Pretty super fucked up situation. Damn the more I'm thinking about it the more I'm realizing yeah that's a pretty traumatic situation. It's ok I've got my terrible sense of humor to shield me from sad things\n\nJust, again, anyone reading this considering trying psychedelics, just be careful dude. There's this whole trend online it seems where it's like oh medicinal science says everyone should trip for all sorts of beneficial reasons but it's like... I disagree. Some folks will have their brains just like, snap in half, lol. It's not for everyone. Be careful? I guess is the message? Who knows though I'm neither a genius nor a doctor lol so this is all anecdotal",

For reference, I've dropped acid and eaten/drank mushrooms like roughly 10-12 times respectively. \n\nAnd again, dude who chose left at the fork in the road had been on lsd for like a week straight, completely lost himself.

And not once in that hundred year history has there been any long term physical health effects; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1129381/ \n\nPlease note; long term physical effects. Like all psychedelics, there's evidence that LSD can 'bring out' latent mental health issues if you're genetically predisposed to them.\n\nThat study I linked, they had 7000ug in 100ml of blood. 7000ug (or 7mg) is roughly 70 doses of acid. These people had literally hundreds of milligrams, when an active dose is MICROgrams. \n\nthe difference in safety profiles (Albeit; very slight, like, to the point where it's negligible and it's a pedantic distinction) comes from the different alkaloids contained in mushrooms. Magic mushrooms don't just have psilocybin; but a ton of other alkaloids too, like muscarine (in trace amounts; amanita have more); and a few of them have (low) toxicity in the human body.\n\n\nAs I said in my OG comment's edit; it's barely a distinction, but if we're being real pedantic and specific, LSD is 'safer' than magic mushrooms, at least on your body.",

In the early 2010's (fuck it hurts saying that) there was a TON of psychedelic phenethylamines being thrown around on blotter as acid; which, if you know what you're buying, and the dosages, to any drug nerd that's not bad, but the main ones (NBOMe series) have such a whack toxicology profile; 25i-NBOMe for example, has had people take 1.2mg+ and been okay, while other people have taken 500ug (micrograms) and died. So that's where a big issue about the 'dangerousness' of acid comes from; other compounds being laid on blotter and being sold as acid. To people who don't know, if it's blotter, it's LSD.\n\nLike, right off the top of my head I can list at least 5 chemicals that I could lay on blotter\n\nEtizolam\n\nDOC\n\n25i-NBOMe\n\n4-AcO-DMT\n\nJWH-018\n\n\nEtizolam is a benzodiazepine analog, DOC is a long lasting psychedelic phenethylamine, 25i is another psychedelic phenethylamine, 4-AcO is a tryptamine, and JWH is a synthetic cannabinoid. \n\nAll of them would produce wildly different effects, and have different dosages (Albeit; the phenethylamines and tryptamines have similar effects), but I hope it kinda gets my point across. I'm baked and rambling a bit now lmao",

I always knew about coke and ex being wild cards because they were always cut with just random shit and you never knew exactly what you were getting, so it makes sense that the same would happen with something like blotter. And to someone like me who pretty much stuck to herb, I'd never have known the difference if you put all 5 in front of me and said \"which is which\". I'd honestly probably have assumed it was like ex/molly where people just added something to give it a different color/taste/whatever non essential identifying detail but the base chemical would be the same.\n\nGiven the WILD success of the war on drugs and the DARE campaign of the 90s (fuck I feel old typing that) I definitely see why LSD got the reputation it had.

There's a ton of straight up LSD analogs these days; with a chemical called 1P-LSD being the most common; and it's practically indistinguishable from the real deal.",

It\u2019s not really fair to ask someone who has no experience with psychedelics to give up 6+ hours of their time humoring someone who\u2019s tripping. In general no one wants to do that. If the sitter also likes to use psychedelics, then at least there\u2019s a mutual offering for trip sitting, and they understand what it\u2019s like being high.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know of a lot of successful relationships where only one person does X and does it around the other person.

Anyways, with liquid shrooms you can redose the same day with better results if you want, since your stomach won't have to deal with the digestion.",

But there are friends I won't do psychedelics with because they have their own version of the endless hula hoop dance. And anyone who thinks they would potentially \"Peter Pan\" to their death on shrooms is someone I absolutely wouldn't trip with. That would keep me scared and on edge.\n\nIt's not nearly as cute as people here without experience might be thinking. Seeing someone you know look like an absolute junkie isn't necessarily attractive or comforting.\n\nHave fun. Live your life. Find a chick who splits a quarter of shrooms with ya and have a blast. My girl and I do our fun things together and it's always a great time. I'm confident you'll find someone to match your vibe, but maybe consider the outward perception of someone doing what you remember doing for that long",

That shit is just weird to me\n\nAlso never felt the need to get naked and dance like that either , not for hours. I\u2019ve tripped with my ex before, and when we got naked, it was not for invisible hula hoop dancing. This whole post kind of read like a r/nothowdrugswork type thing to me",

It didn't hurt, but I knew it probably looked bad and might scare others so I brought him back to our campsite where we found some other people who were with him earlier. I had them talk to him and I can't remember what was said now because it was a few years ago but they basically just brought him back around in his loop and he started speaking in sentences again. The worst part for me was that my husband is always the one I send people to when they're in too deep, so I had no one to turn to when it was him. I wish I could say I brought him out of it, but I was really just a babysitter.\n\nThe best advice I can give is to use a mantra. He was also dosed with a bad psychedelic as a kid and was tripping for literally months. He says using a mantra is the only thing that got him out of it.",

Of course you don't have to like it. Just like it is ok if you don't want anyone in your life who drinks alcohol. That is a perfectly fine personal decision. \n\nThe question is why did she agree to tripsit him then. And the problem is her letting him alone while tripsitting. That is incredibly irresponsible. It is like me asking you to watch over my child and after 2 hours you realize you don't like it. You cannot just go to sleep...\n\n> I think people who have to take drugs or anything to have fun are clowns \n\nThats kinda a bad faith argument. Who said that they **have to** take them to have fun. It's like saying \"I think people who have to watch a movie to have fun are clowns\". No one has to, but that doesn't mean that it still can be fun, doesn't it?\n\n> If naked dancing in your room on shrooms is your idea of fun then yeah you\u2019re immature and are wasting your life so\n\nGatekeeping fun? Maybe you can explain the underlying theory to which fun is immature and which is not? Is dancing in the club and having fun ok or also immature? What is difference other than being naked?",

I'm not stating a level of maturity for any of those ages, just comparing between them.\n\nYour implying that there's no difference in maturity between a 19 and a 22-year-old, which is disingenuous. Even if you think the difference is not statistically significant, that would still be a difference, but I'd argue that it is statistically significant the difference in maturity between a 19 and a 22-year-old, even if there's still a lot of maturity that can still happen after 22.",

Typical reddit assholes.\n\nHe said she seemed pretty keen to trip sit, implying she knows that mushrooms make you trip.. \"Throwing her into the fire with no regard for her well-being or safety\" is a bit of a stretch. \n\nHow about tossing out an entire relationship because of something silly you did on shrooms? No talking about it, setting new boundaries, nothing. Her reaction to be annoyed or frustrated or whatever is completely understandable but I think she learned a valuable lesson not to agree to trip sit for people.

OP is partially to blame too for not being more thorough and acting silly but like you said, she's a fucking adult, and knows damn well that tripping isn't synonymous with \"normal behavior\".\n\nOh and you can see they're using multiple accounts to upvote/downvote...

It sounds like OP got stuck in a thought loop which would confuse the shit out of anyone with no psychedelic experience - especially if they're getting naked at the same time",

Both are children, and hopefully both have learned something from this experience. I'm not mad about the fact that she realized, \"this is not what I want out of a relationship. I'm out.\" I'm upset because what if she went and slept in the living room and he decided he could fly? However uncomfortable you are I *personally* feel as though if you've told someone you will take care of them, you take care of them, or find someone else who can. \n\nHow destroyed would she be if *she* woke up the next morning to a splat outside the bedroom window because she decided, \"fuck this, I'm out\" and he was still tripping?",

You have me questioning it, now\u2026 did she actually ever say she had a problem with the drug use or was it simply his behavior?\n\nI, like most others, assumed she saw the drug use itself as \u201cfrat boyish\u201d but it may have simply been what he did while on them.\n\nI dislike fraternities and the idiocy I saw at them in my time at Michigan - typically a ton of drinking to excess, acting like hooligans (the helicopter dance fits the bill) and, questionable things happening to one of my friends behind locked doors (date rape seems to be a common occurrence among many frat parties, sadly.).  \n\nIf she believes that all trips are like that\u2026 well, that sucks\u2026 but I see your point that maybe she should experience one more trip to see what may happen. But that\u2019s only if she has no inherent problem with the drug use itself.  She may just not like the way he heals and releases (apparently naked dancing.) :)\n\nYou make a good point, however, that maybe she has no problem with drugs and it\u2019s actually with the behavior on them\u2026 in which case - I\u2019m still not a fan of her because I can\u2019t imagine judging someone for one trip\u2019s harmless behavior.  She likely has seen other things and was already on the fence about it, which could be why she was \u201ckeen\u201d to watch him in a more\nUninhibited state of mind to see how he truly acts/feels and it sealed the deal?",

To me it sounds like she watched him until it got late and she was tired so tried to get him to come to bed with her so they could sleep. Then when she observed he was just going to hula hoop indefinitely she went to sleep in the other room. She didn't abandon him somewhere, although she could have watched him better. It doesn't seem like he got hurt.\n\nAnyway, the story sounds funny to me as someone who's done psychedelics but I think about what it might be like for someone who hasn't. He took a drug and then just stood there for hours making weird movements, and she couldn't really communicate with him or make him stop. If she hasn't tripped and has no interest/doesn't know anything about the effects... yeah that could be pretty scary. It's the kind of thing that's funny for 5min and then concerning or scary once you realize you can do NOTHING to stop or break the person out of the weird trance state.",

One of the times I was watching The Wall and started having a bad trip. Then she stopped by and was talking to me and I told her I can't touch anything. She asked if she could touch me and it freaked me out and made my bad trip worse. It was horrible and i basically ran out of the house. She was mad and I remember my friend arguing for me telling her I'm tripping right now and telling her to come back later. \n\nI hate psychedelics now, too many questions. It causes me severe introspection and way too many questions that induces a panic attack. But I did have good times doing them when I was younger.",

The precautions of what was gonna happen should have been apparent prior to dosing so much. Asking a sober young girl then to watch you deteriorate into a garbage mess of a person for several hours without potential consequences was playing some serious ignorance. \n\nYou are young, but also sounds like she doesn't want someone who's slinging drugs. Maybe looking for a partner to settle down with. Now I admit 19 is a lil young for that want, but to each their own. However my mom was married and had me at 19, so I get that perspective.",

Get a friend who knows how it works to sit. It may have just crossed a boundary with her she didn't know she had until it happened. My gf does shrooms, I don't, and I sit for her sometimes. Luckily with her it's not bad at all, but in hindsight I'm probably not the best person to be doing that for her, because I have no idea what it feels like, have no interest in it, and don't know how to calm her down. It's probably how your gf felt during the trip.",

Like, not even stop saying \u201chell yeah donuts fuckin love donuts\u201d long enough to actually order what specific donuts I wanted. Guy at Dunkin knew me and just gave me what I usually get and I was just like \u201chellllllll yeaaaaaaahhhh\u201d) I used to smoke A LOT. Getting high always makes me want to take my clothes off and dance to the music in my head. I was a trip sitter once for my fianc\u00e9 when he tried weed for the first time. It was funny watching him for a while but eventually it turned for the worse and he\u2019s no longer interested in weed but is happy to watch the show and babysit me if I\u2019m high. I just remember him yelling \u201cI AM A ***BABY!!!***\u201d \nHe explained that as him realizing that, in terms of experience with weed, the other girl there and I are mature and know what we\u2019re doing, but he was brand new to the world of being high. I think that started when we started telling him like \u201cdo this thing weed makes it feel better/try this food you\u2019ll enjoy it more while high/here I brought you the Takis you like and now that you\u2019re high it\u2019ll be like fireworks in your mouth,\u201d etc. I don\u2019t remember why he freaked out, but we rolled him into a blanket burrito until he calmed down.

Psychedelics can do the same. Just remember that it's all in your head. If you can, have a \"safe\" word or object that you and your buddy can talk about discussed before hand.

Imagine doing that nudity with people/strangers and they actually record you and post it somewhere random you did it at the safety of your home &with a person YOU trusted to have a trip with. DONT feel fuckin bad, this actually pisses me off because your partner agreed to help and you are hoping to do something new and she ends up feeling bad? Nope nope",

It's good you find out now that she can't keep to her agreements\n\nSide note, being on shrooms enough to know when things are happening will make you a good trip sitter. My husband has that kind of experience (in fact, the first time he let me drive his car when we were first dating was because the shrooms hit while we were getting snacks. Good thing I can drive a standard lmao). I had some post partum anxiety stuff happening when my 2nd was 8 months old. I did the best I could to breast feed until a year and I waited until after that (because weaning can do a number on your mental health) and he decided that since the last three trips had barely done anything to me, he would give me more than usual. \n\nI went to another planet. I couldn't see the floor for the visual hallucinations. At different times he came in to check on me. Asked if I wanted to go look at the stars. No, I wouldn't be able to see them. Made sure I wasn't hot. Helped me to the bathroom because I couldn't see where I was going. At the perfect moment, he turned on my favorite album. Halfway through it, he came in and caressed my entire body. It was a mind blowing experience. The human touch right when the visuals start fading and the sexual urges began (which is dumb because you can't come). It was such a mind blowing experience that I wrote it all down the next day so I wouldn't forget because it was AMAZING\n\nAnyways, you'd be a great trip sitter I bet",

The oldest ad hominem in the Internet <3\n\nIt's obvious what I mean by drugs. Go ahead with your pseudo-intelectual trying to normalize being drugged to have fun. Maybe when everyone consumes drugs.\n\nKeep your insults to yourself. I have no interest in drugs nor am I'm obliged to study things I have zero interest in. I just don't like people normalizing drugs. Imagine seriously implying someone that doesn't have an interest in drugs must have no studies. Do you imagine how many children may have read this whole thread and think \"Oh drugs are cool after all and my parents and teachers are all liars!\"? Of course not. \n\nIf the story is true, it's clear the GF didn't know what the fuck was going on and just wanted to see her BF happy. The drugged one should have explained what trip sitting entails.\n\n>I never said she didn\u2019t have a right, where is this coming from?\n\nMaybe read the comments to get some context? The guy I answered to was being attacked for not using drugs / not wanting to date someone who uses drugs.\n\n>state propaganda. \n\nDamn the state and their propaganda to keep children far from drugs. Let children have all the shrooms and fuck people who suffered because of people around them being drug addicts, am I right? What are you? An anarchist?",

Shit-tons of much older people suffer in miserable relationships, sometimes for *years*, before one of them finally makes the effort to end it.\n\n> if she thinks a shrooms trip is \"fray boy behavior\"\n\nHuh? She didn't think that *shrooms* is frat boy behavior. She thinks that what he specifically did is frat boy behavior. And if you believe this one event is the only reason why she broke up with him, you're pretty dense.\n\n> Volunteering to sober sit and then get pissy about it probably seemed like a wonderful opportunity to her.\n\nAaaaaand there's the inevitable misogyny.

Think about how media portrays cannabis vs. how high a non-user would get if they diesel'd an entire joint by themselves with 0 tolerance - they'd probably get turbo high and anxious using that much with 0 experience while expecting cannabis to be a super chill, relaxing thing.\n\nI know I would have....a very difficult time explaining to friends even what you're feeling on relatively low doses of psilocybin or lsd, because so much stimulation, ideas, energy, etc is flowing through you to begin with that it's difficult to spend time on a single definition - lol that's why we end up stretching and dancing and hula'ing and having a jovial time when we do this shit, haha!\n\nAlso, too be fair, psychedelics can be hard in a single setting like never leaving an apartment or something. Hehe last time I tripped I had taken 1P-LSD ('legal' research chem here in canada, or it was for a glorious while, and likely it is metabolized as lsd-25 in your body. Per my own experience the two really feel alike/same) and just walked around my cities downtown core, abandoned at the time with the first of the big covid shutdowns. Was so nice walking the city with a good high and energy going, do recommend. You need music, a safe place to come back too, and safe places to enjoy yourself when doin' that stuff. \n\nSorry about the break up, lol, she may have been nice but sounds like you two maybe have different interests and stuff anyways. Also sounds like it was maybe her first time watching someone use drugs or something too and maybe it was too much for her, which is also fair if you don't know what you're gettin' into.",

She evidently just didn't know much about what people can be like on shrooms. Just like the vast majority of people.\n\nShe didn't do anything immature. In fact, the ability to a) know the kind of personality that will mesh well with your own, b) look at your relationship and realize that your partner is not that kind of personality, and then c) get out of it, is objectively mature. Especially for a 19-year-old. Tons of adults never learn this. Oftentimes, they stew in the collective misery of a failed relationship for *years* until one of them finally quits.",

Best fucking trip of my life after I got past the initial paranoia. We literally sat on the couch cuddling watching youtube videos. Even the damn ads were cracking us up into 2 minute longs bursts of laughter. \n\nAnd I also did some things relativly similar to \u201cinvisible hula-hooping\u201d, my wife would\u2019ve died laughing regardless of being high or sober, she just has that kind of humor. If this post is legit OP, you dodged a massive bullet. You need a partner that can laugh their ass off to funny high/drunken shenanagins.",

As I grew and saw friends with girlfriends like that I saw that they had a bad relationship . Drugs were the important part of their life . They often cheated , stole , lied and the relationship never lasted . It was fun for a short time but their heartbreak was longer . I learned that all though It looks like fun I wasn\u2019t . So I looked for a different kind of girlfriend. No drugs or such things , Not sexually mischievous as I am , no heavy metal or lifestyle in it. I lord for an upstanding one that wanted to work towards a goal. Maybe not as much fun as what my previous choice was but a lot more rewarding.  Look at your life and decide which is more important and what you are willing to give up . She did .  If you keep going the direction you are going ( not judging) then the results will be the same . Only when you change will your choices change . Good luck.\nBtw . I\u2019ve done stupid shit also . This is what made me stop",

I got cocky since I've never had a bad trip and am pretty put together even on 5.5g.\n\nUnfortunately the setting of being around so many strangers and having to hike down a fucking mountain could almost be described as traumatic.\n\nIt felt like *everyone* knew I was high and was downright pissed off at me for it and judging me harshly.\n\nOne of my buddies lent me his earbuds to use so I could listen to music, but that almost increased the paranoia since I couldn't actually hear what was going on around me.\n\nIn my mind, people were loudly warning oncoming hikers that I was high as fuck and to be cautious, and I could see the looks on their faces as they passed by me, just disgusted with me. So many angry Karen glares. In reality they were probably just exhausted from hiking up hill.\n\nI was convinced the police were going to be waiting for me at the bottom, and literally believed I could see them approaching the car after I got in (it was just my buddy with a fluorescent logo on his shirt)\n\nI thought I was going to be arrested, and that my wife was furious with me and was going to divorce me and I was going to lose custody of our newborn.\n\nOn the drive out I wanted to talk to my wife so badly but didn't have cell signal for a while. When I finally did talk to her she just thought it was hilarious.",

I'm not advocating anything extreme, but knowing how they respond to a curveball is critical information that cannot be acquired 2nd hand. One must witness this. One must become the curveball.\n\nYou did good. Learning this at a young age, and repeating it each time a courtship begins moving into a serious state will ensure that you will at the very least, find someone who can put up with our shit. Maybe not all of it....  But just enough not to cut and run when you naked hula hoop on the bed while tripping balls.",

My best friend and I went wayyy overboard on some liquid THC once. It was our first time and we didn't know what to expect. We had our chronically sober friend there with us to babysit, and to this day I regret scaring the living shit out of him especially because I had such a horrible time myself lmfao. Him being there helped as much as it could because I was losing my shit and thought I would be in it forever, but it wasn't something I would've wanted to put someone else through if I had the choice.",

Still a lot of learning about herself to do before she'll really know what she needs in a relationship. Maybe you'll find someone who is more open minded and caring next.\n\nSomething I always remind people, is that a successful relationship can end. Meaning, you'll most likely have a few before you find \"the one\", and each one will teach you more about who you are in a relationship and what you need, and sometimes the right thing to do is break up. There is no nobility in staying together for the sake of it. A relationship that ends can also be successful, if you remember that dating is about finding your way just as much as finding a partner.",

She sounds like a dumb asshole that you're better off without if this was THE reason she left. Do you have fratboy vibes when you're sober? \n\n Maybe i'm jumping to assumptions, maybe there should have been better preparation and communication, but you were ON SHROOMS... does she not get people act wacky on that? \n\nShe also proved herself to be an immature, shitty trip sitter if she couldn't be bothered to talk to you and watch over in your vulnerable state because she got too bored and annoyed with you hula hooping .. i mean wtf?? It sounds like she only cared because she was expecting to have some entertainment \n(Btw why were you touching your adams apple when you swallowed? )\n\nMaybe she wouldn't have acted so ignorant and childish if she'd ever had to deal with someone actually having a bad trip lol... and then you still felt like YOU were the one who had to apologize when she left you high and dry?\nJust curious, does this happen often with her, that she like ditches or does you wrong and then it's somehow your fault to be sorry for?",

Girls don't up and break up with guys in an exclusive relationship that they care about over the little things. They decide that it's over and then wait and keep dating you while usually talking to some other dude(s) they can jump to until you make an overt enough fuckup that they can easily justify breaking up with you with that.\n\nJust hope you figure things out eventually. Doing drugs at like age 19/20 is fun and funny. Doing drugs on the reg after age 25 normally makes you a loser that's made a habit of it. I don't know anyone mid 20's or later that still gets fucked up and trips on the regular that isn't an addict or a fuckup trying to cover up mental health issues with drugs. Usually multiple drugs in addition to hallucinogens. The choices you make will follow you throughout your life. Speaking from experience, dont let things become habits. Sure the hallucinogens cops will come in and say how \"safe\" and  productive they are, but IME if you're doing them just casually in normal circumstances for no real reason...if you don't already have a habit, you'll catch one soon.",
