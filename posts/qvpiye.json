That's what I see these types of mothers as, Rachel fees\n\nThe only justice from this story is that Rachel Fee and her lesbian partner who both went to jail for life are apprently heavily bullied by the other female inmates for what they did to 3 young little boys. I'm against bullying but they desvere every bit of it.\n\nAnyone who looks at a baby boy and sees a monster obviously needs professional help.

And on the other, I have some random dude on the internet who spends his time arguing with anti-feminists telling me that I shouldn't trust these sources because \"muh masagony.\"\n\nThe men's rights sub is just a vessel. Most of those studies conducted are not even linked to the MRM at all. Yet you seem to want to ignore that overwhelming evidence they contain.\n\nYou're like an anti-vaxxer. The facts are there and the only ones you care about are your own, even if they're opinions. \n\nYou were never like me, and you never will be. You've always been an emotionally driven dumbass, according to you, and it seems that has not change.\n\nYou'd think with age someone would become more logical, but I guess it's true when they say the brain deteriorates as you get older.",
