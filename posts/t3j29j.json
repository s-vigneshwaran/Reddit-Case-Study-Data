I know the Romans were active in the region, I think the Greeks might have been as well, and probably plenty before.  \n\n\nAlso, names of conflict can change from nation to nation depending on perspective, so its probably unfair for me to declare which one WAS the Balkan Wars. I was speaking from purely an American/British taught history and I often forget to consider other perspectives. Cheers for knowing your history and thank you for your perspective!

If you\u2019re Lebanese, Palestinian, or Arab you\u2019re not white.  If you\u2019re an orthodox Christian you are not white.  But if you marry a white person your kids could be white if you make enough money and don\u2019t go to a weird church.  If your from the Caucasus your race is a function of wealth. If you\u2019re poor you\u2019re not white.  If you\u2019re wealthy you are white.  \n\nAsia gets tricky, you\u2019re definitely not black and are better than black people but generally you aren\u2019t white.  You are the model minority.  Used as a bludgeon against black people so you get points for that.  As long as there are fewer than 8 of you you can be honorary white people.  Kinda.  Don\u2019t push it.  \n\nAll black people are bad.  Ones from Africa are Better than ones descended from slaves but only a little bit.  \n\nI don\u2019t have time to go through all the Hispanic and Latin permutations.  Just trust that you are better than black people even if you are an illegal immigrant but you\u2019ll only ever be useful as a bludgeon against black people.  \n\nSo to summarize. If your name ends in a vowel you can\u2019t be white.  If your ancestors didn\u2019t come froM North of the Rubicon and west of the Odra rivers you are unlikely to be white.  It\u2019s ok though, if you\u2019re not black white people might need you enough to grant you temporary whiteness until the crisis fades.\n\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nI also hope the sarcasm dripped enough to not confuse anyone.",

And the PARK is a national treasure. \n\nAudacity. \n\n\n So yep, thats what defines a country as civilized to me. How does it feel about me and my kind? Simple right? Even Germany accepts judgment for the Holocaust and paid back the victims in SOME way... In America though,  caucasians challenge black people's claims every day. Like we made up racism. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.. okay.   Audacity is audacious as fuck in America. \ud83d\ude46\ud83c\udfff\ud83d\ude06",

You couldn't take one last day off from capilltulating with racism? What is that frailty like? Do you have SOME decency in you? Are you made from good natured ingredients at all? What are you????  GENUINE QUESTIONS!! Does it make YOU feel better?  Its gotta be a mental illlness... or some sickness... cause when every one is wearing pink ribbons in October, yall never say, \"All Cancers matter!\".. cause no one hates women that much. Or breasts...  But as SOON as a black man wants to be heard saying \"America is racist as fuck.\", yall be like  \"yeah but..\". But what? \"Yeah but...umm.. its also xenophobic! And hedonistic!! And and.... other stuff!! So don't complain!\"... what? Like fr... what? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02  America is terrible to all immigrants and poor people.. but thaaaaaaats your 'argument' against black people calling out racism??? Man you're either missing the entire point or you're so ethically and logically repressed that you'd make the perfect republican. \n\nMy statement was about racism. Not every-other-p4oblem-ism...... But I've never in my LIFE told another oppressed person, \"well yea, I got treated bad too, so stop complaining!\"... cause WHO DOES THAT?! . \n\nI advocate for gays because I hate being a marginalized and oppressed class. \n\nI fight patriarchy cause why not? Its stupid. \n\nWhats YOUR agenda? \n\nAre you gonna feed every starvng person on the planet before you worry about your own family though? Or do you only expect black people to solve every other problem in america or have an answer for domestic-white on foreign- white hate before any one simply acknowledges the ongoing genocide of my people by police and systemic deprivation of the American dream? \n\nHUH?\n\nHow do you like loaded MY questions? \n\nBro if it bothers you when people complain about oppression, stifle the oppression, not the complaint. \n\nCause I mean... here's a list of the problems African descendents have already solved for the world. Read up,, and if you REALLY wanna stop being a dick and get out the way of progress and justice for a moment, stop being the \"yeah, but\" guy when oppressed people make their claims.  \n\n\n[The world WE designed](https://dailyhive.com/seattle/inventions-by-black-people)",

The point of that wasn't to \"whatabout\" the situation, just to relativize what it seemed you were claiming, aka that it's all racism. It's not.",

There supermarkets had the same esthetics as ours, they have similar advertising and people used the same technology as us. I'm in Lithuania right now, and I keep seeing people with bags of stuff, speaking Ukrainian and holding their Ukrainian passports as they get on coaches. It really drives home how much this is really something unprecedented, how I never imagined to see people fleeing from a war a few hours away by train, from such a modern country. \n\nSorry for rambling I just wanted to share what I've been observing personally.",

Essentially, they are saying this a region that is not used to seeing this kind of stuff. And frankly it's about time it did see this stuff.

(as a side note: also some considerer certain countries \"uncivilized\" but they are just relatively poor and/or underdeveloped, yet nothing else is bad or wrong with the general population)\n\nPeople live together under a complex society with laws, police, schools, a political systems with elections, work, homes, etc. To be truly \"uncivilized\" they did be living in tribes, hunting and gathering, with a minimal rule system that only affects the particular tribe; which would also mean that no other country will recognize them as a country.\n\nAs wrong as some countries may seems due to certain aspects (and yeah, some countries have fucked up people leading and indoctrinating their population), if one calls a country uncivilized for certain behaviors from part of their population, then how civilized truly are \"1st world countries\" where people harass, attack and murder others over their skin color, language, religion and more? That would be uncivilized aswell.\n\nEdit: Fix.",

Do tell me how much better it was before the US occupation (which I also opposed btw). Imo we should have stayed out of it and left Iraq to their sectarian violence.\n\nBTW I have nothing against Arabic people. It's not skin tone that I have an issue with and these generalizations don't apply to everyone. Theocracies of any kind, and especially ones that haven't reformed their religion ever, are centers of human rights violations. I don't care for US Christians either but there are few actual fundamentalists. Most don't even believe I the old testament and consider most of the Bible to be a parable, not divine revelation. I hope you don't own a dog, drink alcohol, or use silver utensils. Also remember whatever is conducive to the haram is also haram, such as you using reddit (which hosts pornography). Also falsely representing the haram as halal is haram.\n\n[source](https://books.google.com/books?id=v21NCwAAQBAJ&printsec=copyright#v=onepage&q&f=false)\n\nAre you claiming this Islamic scholar is wrong? Seems kinda haram to me. I told you you don't want to play this game. Wanna talk about the return from Medina to Mecca?",
