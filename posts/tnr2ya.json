  "text": "TIFU by showing my college friends a picture of my mom\nIt over is a pretty normal day at university and a conversation came up about our parents. A friend of mine, \u201cJenny\u201d shows us a picture of her father so I pull up Facebook images of my mother and father. A friend of mine saw my father and said I looked just like him but when he saw my mother the color in his face drained.\n\n\u201cChad\u201d watched me scroll down my picture of my mon then asked about my siblings. He described them in detail, PERFECT DETAIL!!! He then said to me, \u201cLilly, I think I fucked your mom.\u201d I laughed of course, Chad has a reputation and I figured it was a joke until he described my siblings, my mothers home, the neighborhood and ect. \n\nI felt horror. Sheer horror. He looked at me, and I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I looked at him, and he looked at me, and I looked at him! Just a few days ago he was flirting with me and what not! And now I find out, he\u2019s a motherfucker! Literally a motherfucker!\n\n\nTLDR; college friend fucked by mom, described her and my family in detail, and had been trying to put the moves on my days prior without realizing I was her daughter. MOTHERFUCKER!\n\n\nEdit: To clarify some more things, apparently he found her through a hook up ad. She had someone watching my siblings while she took him to the bone zone\u2026 so the bed I\u2019ve sat on has mom and Chad juices on them. He asked me to call him daddy now. I feel homicidal.\n\nEdit 2: my parents haven\u2019t been together for as long as I\u2019ve been alive. My Mom has not had a long lasting relationship through out my life and I kind of blame myself for that. I say this because I was never an easy kid. I was bitter and sad and no one wants a woman with a child that doesn\u2019t receive the necessary mental help to thrive. My mom and I also don\u2019t have the best relationship either. I always felt she was a bit envious of me do to the fact that I\u2019ve been able to maintain a relationship longer than she has at my young age. While I\u2019m a bit frazzled at the prospect of my friend doing my mom I guess I can\u2019t be mad at him because he genuinely didn\u2019t know. A little ways down the road we\u2019ll both laugh at this. My Giga Chad sigma male friend will not end up sleeping with me tho because I am deeply into someone else. My partner said I should fuck his mom tho to assert my dominance.",

He\u2019s a wealthy man who offers you security. \n\nBut here\u2019s the twist: on the night of your bachelorette party you have way too much to drink and you call him. He doesn\u2019t answer but you leave him a voice mail confessing your love. \n\nSo now it\u2019s your wedding day. You look for him, but he\u2019s no where to be found.

But you keep looking around; you wonder if he\u2019s going to show. \n\nIt\u2019s raining. \n\nSo now you\u2019re standing at the alter. And just as the preacher says \u201c..if anyone here can think of a reason..\u201d BOOM! The church doors fly open and he stumbles in, soaking wet and wearing a tux. \n\nHe runs up to the alter and confesses that he too, is in love with you. \n\nYou look up at his dad. \n\nYou look back at him.\n\nYou take his hand and you both run out of the church and into the rain together. Yes, you\u2019ll never have his father\u2019s money but at least you\u2019ll be happy together. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s How You Get the Girl\u201d, by Taylor Swift, plays over the end credits. \n\nBoom.

Dw it gets worse. A random guy kept calling her and when I\u2019d look at her then the phone she\u2019d act suspicious. Then one day she left for almost a month without any warning and my dad said she was with the guy she was having an affair with. I cried and cried since I missed her. She rarely answered but the one time she did I asked her if she was coming home and she said \u201cno baby\u201d. My dad started talking about a divorce and if I\u2019d pick him to which I said hell yes I will. She came back eventually and gave me a cold cupcake and an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d then proceeded to have a long talk with my dad while sobbing because she realized she really fucked up. Long story short it\u2019s been years and despite wanting to still wash my eyes out with bleach from the images, I love my mom to death. She and my dad stayed together and worked things out.",

I am going to go ahead and go along with option B. \n\nYou post and edits imply that you are still very young, but you also said you feel your mom evies your ability to hold down a relationship longer than she has and then imply you are single. That doesn't really add up, no reasonable adult is jealous of a child's relationship length. Especially if that relationship has since ended.\n As many others already pointed out, you feel responsible for your mothers relationships not lasting. That is absurd. She is the adult, her failings are her own just as yours are your own now that you are an adult. You state you have siblings, your mother likely works. A single parent with a job has a lot on thier plate already, making ample time for a relationship is a monumental task. And the pool of prospective long term partners for them is not large. You are taking too much blame and giving too much of yourself away to your anxiety. I reccomend you have a talk with your mom about these things, and try to directly confirm how she feels about the past and you. Good luck.",

He was only 24 at the time. My parents were only 33 and 36. They were very young when I was born. Anyway... on the way to the store we were driving passed a park that was always known as a late night car hookup place. As im pulling up to the stop sign by the entrance he says \"you know we should just stop over there for a few on the way back\". Im like \"wtf are you saying James?\" He says \"look all I'm saying is I've had your mom, now I want the new and improved version.\" I thought to myself im tripping. Theres no way he said what I think he said. So I ask him to repeat it, he does and I lost my shit! Omg I snapped on him the whole way and once we got back to my house I confronted my mom. She of course denied it and got defensive as fuck! She threw the first punch like she always did and I went nuts! By the next morning I was homeless. Thats how I found out my mom is the \"Blow Job Queen of the East Side\" no joke! I later found out that literally every guy that ever walked into my house she fucked! Her favorite side pieces were my exes. Turns out she's fucked them all including my ex-husband of 12 years! I would much rather have your story than mine! It was not easy growing up with a mom like her especially before i knew why people treated me the way they did.",

You keep friends that are actively trying to get with you knowing you already have someone, you are just asking for disaster. The honesty is good, the situation is not good. I mean, there is a lot of missing details here, like have you been friends for long, is it just one time he flirted, does he know how into your partner you are, does you partner have any friends that do the same thing and would you be ok with that... Obviously this isn't about your mom anymore, but maybe it is, because that's your focus in this post instead of the more critical issue of having friends that flirt with you.\n\nListen, I'm not trying to criticize you or tell you I know better, I am pulling from my own life experiences that there are toxic people out there who have ulterior motives. If your partner is really cool with this situation, that's actually quite worrisome.  You should stop focusing on what your mom is doing, and start focusing on showing your partner you would do anything for them, including dropping a clearly toxic friend.",

Chad and Mom were consenting adults, and they acted without knowledge of the relationship of Mom to OP.  In this sense they cannot be blamed.  Just to note, Sophocles wrote a play about  this theme and it did not end well. \n\nC.  We must have sympathy for OP.  She has done nothing to deserve this situation but fate thrust it on her.  Being Antigone is not a lot of fun\n\nD.  Chad however acted unethically by revealing a secret.  People who have sex normally do so in a situation which is private and have reasonable expectations of privacy. If Chad is mature enough for an adult relationship then he is old enough to know when to shut up.  Mom has that right to expect privacy about her choices. (Who tells their own Mum about their hottest dates). Chad's actions are not much different from hiding a camera to spy on someone's sex without consent.  His stupid remarks do not help his case here.  This is a person who reveals sexual secrets for no good reason and I advise you to avoid him as a scumbag\n\nE.  The remaining issue is weather or not OP should inform her Mother that her private life is no longer secret.  At least this would prevent Chad or his friends from returning for more.  One might argue that Mum should not be informed as it could humiliate her to know.  But I think truth is probably the best answer here in order to prevent further humiliation and avoid future harassment\n\nF.  Now you know why Oedipus gouged out his own eyes. I do not advise that as a solution.",
