And per joker \"I don't have the hips to pull off a suit like that\"  and he's right, very few do.\n\nPlus she's got the longest companion quest line and its heavily integrated into the main story line with the fleet and ranoch.  Like a massive conspiracy, a court marshal, a fire fight, politics. And then we've got a massive war, more political intrigue, rescue missions, Saratoga plots, chunks of lore going back hundreds of years, space battles, fucking up a reaper one on one, orbital bombardment, reclaiming a home world.\n\nAnd adorable, great writing, especially the two or three times she gets drunk like after that one death or at the house party.  Or when she gets you to watch that movie, cringey but in a cute way.  Plus awesome as an engineer and one of the best fighters with the hacking, and electrocution, and the giant ass krogan shotgun I had her use.\n\nPlus somewhat mysterious both with the alien culture and the mask, and the accent.  Plus it's interesting just how bad you can fuck it up too.\n\nIt's an opinion but I think that's way better than the essentially grunge yandere with a sidequest about nuking a facility in which she was tortured for years.  Plus she only appears in game 2 and leaves for 3.",
