  "text": "TIFU by trying polyamory\nA few weeks ago, me (27F) and my partner (27M) broached the topic of potentially dating other people also. We do the entire negotiation of the boundaries, rules for making things work, hard limits on what is okay, etc. Great! I am more interested in adding another partner to our relationship, but my partner wanted to try dating separately first, just to see. I\u2019m a reasonable girl, so I\u2019m game to try it, and after a few weeks of attempts we set up our dates for the same day (today). I chose friendly acquaintance guy from another department at work and he chose hot rando girl from Tinder. We excitedly wish one another luck and head off on our respective dates!\n\n My date (who we will call Mark) and I meet up at a cute seafood restaurant for dinner together. Things start off rocky. It becomes immediately clear that Mark has never been within 6 feet of a human woman. I am doing all of the talking, and he is staring at me intently and nodding his head in silence. I eventually run out of things to say because he isn\u2019t participating and start desperately looking at my phone, texting and browsing Reddit, to avoid the unbearable awkwardness. Eventually Mark takes some initiative and participates in conversation, and is actually telling me about himself. Whew, maybe he isn\u2019t actually a serial killer and is just a little nervous! \n\nAfter some really fun and invigorating conversation, Mark then decides to drop all of his bombshells on me at random and with no warning! He lets me know that he lives with his parents, has a small penis, and enjoys playing with dolls. Okaaaay. I did not ask for this information lol. I reassure him that these things are fine (probably?) and kind of laugh it off as a weird joke that fell flat . At this point, I am ready to flee, but Mark mentions the movie I had planned for us at my house after dinner. I begrudgingly accept because I am a huge pushover, and I am still holding out hope that Mark will surprise me and completely change back into the normal guy that I know from work. \n\nObviously you all know this didn\u2019t happen. As we are watching the movie, Mark tries to pull a move on me. And by pull a move, I mean startle me by basically jumping off of the couch and ripping his pants down. I panic, because 1. There has not been any indication I am interested in having sex with him at all and 2. His penis was actually so small that there was no way I could have sex with him even if I wanted to. I am not one to body shame at all, and I have never cared about a partner\u2019s size, but I just don\u2019t see how it would be possible. \n\nSo my body just does what it normally does when I get into a state of panic: immediately vomit. Just right onto the floor. We are both frozen, staring at the vomit-y carpet. I look him directly in the eyes and quietly tell him that I don\u2019t think dinner agreed with me, and that he should probably leave. He does. \n\nMy partner returns home a little later and said his date was also a bust. His lovely lady pulled out a baggie of cocaine on the drive home and proceeds to turn on all of the interior lights in his car, so that she can scoop up a spoonful using her special coke spoon that was apparently decoratively attached to her wallet? I am just in shock, dating is tough, I\u2019m not thinking we will be trying this again for quite some time. Godspeed to my single people out there.\n\nTL;DR Me and my partner tried dating other people. My date probably went home thinking his dick was so horrifying it made me vomit. Partner\u2019s date did blow in his car. Never again. Maybe.\n\nEDIT: Did not really expect so many to be interested in me anxiety-barfing in the direction of my date. Mark, if you are out there reading this, no hard feelings. I think you were just really nervous and awkward. I hope you know that my getting sick had very little to do with your penis size and everything to do with that being unprovoked and shocking. Someone will care about and appreciate you just the way you are. Please be careful about asking people for consent before you try things with a new partner, and when someone says they will not have sex with you and it\u2019s just a date, they mean it. Let\u2019s uh\u2026.never speak of this ever and go back to being regular work acquaintances.\n\nEDIT 2?: I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re supposed to edit a lot or not lol. But getting a lot of the same questions, so figured I would try to answer! Yes, literally every single person involved was informed about all of the other people, and specifically told that this would be a date only and sex was not a possibility. Hence the confusion and panic. No, did not throw up from seeing a weird dick. Have anxiety. I have thrown up in a grocery store, I have had to leave people hanging that I was interviewing to throw up, this has happened at least once at every job I\u2019ve worked at. This is the least weird part of the story, for me anyways. No, I don\u2019t think my partner is going to leave me. No, I do not want to leave my partner. No, I do not want to go on a date with any of the random internet people in my messages, did you learn nothing from this?! Me and my partner have had a great laugh over this, thank you everyone for making this into something fun instead of something terrible. I hope everyone out there has the same luck in finding their perfect match(es) out there! \ud83d\udc95",

Mark cheated on Jan while at a work conference, and they decided that Jan had a \"freebie\" in order to make it right.\n\nSo, eventually, Jan found a woman to sleep with (they're both bi), let's call her Christine.   Well, it ends up turning into a thing between the two women, and eventually Mark gets involved too, so it's two women and a man.  \n\n\nWell, it turns out that Christine has been seeing a guy, Gary, and somehow he gets brought in on this too.  So, it's Mark, Jan, Christine, and Gary sleeping with one another and various formations for several months.  But as time goes on, things get weird, and eventually, Mark and Jan get divorced, though all keep living together.\n\n\nAnyway, eventually the fourway arrangement stops, and Jan and Gary end up getting married, while Mark and Christine got married.\n\n\nAll I ever thought about was whether this was confusing for Mark and Jan's kids, who were probably 2 and 5 when this started, and 8 and 11 now",

I\u2019ve been in proximity to a lot of poly arrangements and part of a few and they are really never sustainable. Fun, liberating, a way to challenge feelings of attachment or jealousy, or learn better communication.. sure, but not usually sustainable. That\u2019s kind of inherently part of polycules imo, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s a flux state, and while I\u2019m sure there are some edge cases that have lasting potential, the arrangements are usually fleeting. But the scene seems to attract a few main types of people:\n\n-those who want to be open and honest about dating around without the expectation of exclusivity. \n\n-couples on the rocks who aren\u2019t quite willing to let th connection be lost. \n\n-people who want to believe they are more emotionally mature than they are. Might be true believers, but are repressing intense feelings of jealousy or insecurity. (No hate, been there) \n\n-all out narcissists.. lol\n\nI would say a functional poly situation is no more harmful or helpful than having divorced parents who are still on decent civil speaking terms. But that\u2019s just my thought. Definitely not a definitive ones better or worse thing.",

It tends to be, at least from my perspective, that the best polyamorous relationships are those where sex is treated like a fun adult activity unrelated to your commitment to your partner. Like a pornhub version of going to your friends house and playing with legos. I personally don\u2019t see how that wouldn\u2019t be just as sustainable as any other relationship, if not even moreso because it takes cheating (via sex with other people) out of the equation.",

That's not a normal situation to expose them to by any means and it's going to reframe how those kids see relationships for their whole lives. Statistically divorce by itself is really hard on kids and then you're throwing in a really outlandish living situation. Do you really think that's not going to have a major impact on them?",

They did a very good job at hiding it from me when I was young but I have found out in recent years that things were probably  a lot worse than I realized.

I wouldn't really say I'm *attracted* to my roommates in any way (fyi I've only lived in this current apartment for two months) and we don't really interact much. Yet I tend to find myself unconsciously acting/reacting to them as if they were my spouse. (I don't equate marriage with romance/sex/attraction so I can understand why you might have assumed that though).\n\nI also tend to fall in love pretty fast but then immediately back-pedal hard if there's any sign the person actually likes me.

Statically speaking it's more likely you'll be cheated on or cheat on someone than not.

Humans want to feel desired and loved and if someone doesn't feel that then they'll seek it out. It's not right to cheat on your partner, I believe those feelings which lead to cheating should be discussed and explored with healthy dialogue.

However, every additional partner in a relationship is an exponential increase in the difficulty of maintaining a non-toxic relationship. Since most people fail to do it even with just 2 partners, poly groups tend to have a lot of toxicity if every person is not *very* emotionally mature. Throw in the stress of taking care of children and that gets even harder.\n\nAnd since all of this started as a result of cheating, and then extra cheating to make up for the first cheating, (Though the second is consenting, so its fine, it just might not be the most healthy way to deal with it.) I have my doubts about the overall emotional maturity of the people involved.\n\nSo it is possible, but highly risky, especially with kids. I hope it worked out for them, but I have yet to see even far less complicated versions of this work out long term, despite a number of my acquaintances and friends trying it.

And he talked somewhat about it in class with us he claimed it negatively affected him, he tried to emulate his mother by becoming gay, and that it took him years to realize he was straight and he married a woman, regretting the gay acts of his youth. He put his story out there in videos and discussions on the internet a few years back but from what I observed he got cyberbullied SO much with people commenting, \"you are actually gay\" that I think partly because of that and paranoia he deleted his own entire online presence.    \n\n\nI think it is sad because he was a advocate of people being able to be free to express their own sexuality by choice and if that sexuality changes its okay. A lot of people today would understand this but back then just about a decade ago people were bullying with \"you are just gay\".",

Turns out that my parents not only hated each other, they hated each other since before I was born, and I was an accidental third child that threw another expected 2 years on their plan to split up.

X and Y are still your mom and dad, while W and Z are your (step parent/honorary aunt or uncle/W and Z).\" Kids don't care as much as adults think they do when it comes to relationship dynamics. As long as there is consistency with the relationship dynamics the child has, everything else is a matter of patience and explanation.\n\nIt isn't as though the concept of \"multiple favorites\" is unknown (I myself had at least three \"favorite\" colours at the age of 5) and at the end of the day, the person you're dating or partnering with is essentially your \"favorite person.\" Given the fact people are more complicated than colours, it's even more understandable that someone would be able to find multiple compatible partners.",

I can't remember off the top of my head... we could never work out which daddy was the kids biological dad... he looked like daddy 2 but that could have just been because of his race, his personality (and neurodivergency) was exactly like daddy 1 but that could have been because that's how he was taught to behave (not the neurodivergency bit obviously)...\n\nWeirdly there was another kid in the same school who had a similar family situation but they families didn't know each other before they met at school. I thought the \"mail order bride club\" would have been a thing but apparently not.",

We both went to high school.\nShe introduced me to the policeman that stopped you.\n\n(Spending 8 hours memorizing the first 5 chapters of Trapped in the Closet when I was 14 totally paid off.

Certainly, that coal miner is gonna have a much bigger appreciation for money or family than the guy who works as an executive with money pouring on him.\n\nYes, they misbehave because they are spoiled and given easy access to sexual escapades and relationships.\n\nSo when they do something outrageous, they don't do it because they are \"crappy people\" but because their outrageous and crappy behavior usually works out just fine, but it doesn't work out for an ugly guy or a fat guy or a short guy.\n\nSo yes scientifically speaking, it has everything to do with their physical appearance shaping their psychology.\n\nGo through your list of all the people you've dated, were any of them ugly, potbellied, or super short? If not, that explains why you keep running into 3 out of 3 men who do horrible things.\n\nThey're not crappy people, they're human beings who've been spoiled and maybe... and maybe... with how angrily you reacted to me, maybe you too were spoiled.\n\nDon't think I don't know how it is. You can't fool me on this... I've had very attractive girlfriends and not so attractive ones.\n\nYou can tell how their ego shoots up with how many guys approach them at bars, even some coming up to me at the club asking for desperate tips on \"how to get a girl like that\"... They have the best make-up, they know how to do make-up properly. They know how to do their hair the best way. They know the right stylish sexy clothing to wear for the bar... They know how to get men going wild. And they know it works every time...\n\nCompared that to the girlfriends who were more \"normal or mediocre looking.\" Their misbehavior was to match, the better looking the girl is, the more misbehavior can be foreseen--hence they are \"ex-girlfriends\" who I dumped...\n\nSame thing happens to men who are good looking. Women undress in front of them. Women go up to them in the club and \"accidentally run into them\" just to talk to them. They have big muscles and are tall, so women just wanna touch them even without permission for some reason...\n\nWomen suddenly giggle at their mundane boring sentences. The guy could be a total airhead... it doesn't matter. The guy could believe in Alex Jones conspiracy theories--it doesn't matter. He could talk about his video games and it doesn't matter.... The guy could be a minimum wage working waiter, it doesn't matter, when he's at the club, things just work out and so he doesn't need to develop any social skills, and neither do those hot women.\n\nAgain, this doesn't apply for \"EVERYONE\"... I'm giving you the reality.\n\nIt's not \"every hot girl\" or \"every hot guy\"... But **many**.",

I don't disagree that conventionally attractive people have it much easier than others, but I can not follow your logic here.\n\nYou know that what you describe is an entire culture of \"normalcy\" and the \"status quo\" perpetuated in hollywood and society, and although it's generally revolving around attractiveness in some way, it's not necessary to be attractive to behave like this....at all. It's a bunch of unintelligent people doing what they think they \"should\" do. It's something I can not relate to at all. \n\nAnd for whatever it's worth, most men I have been with would not at all be considered conventionally attractive.

It also sends an irreversible message to your partner that any chance of monogamy is now over, and you've opened a door that cannot be closed or forgotten.\n\nCheck out any of the major open relationship subreddits to get an idea of how depressing it can get...it's an *extremely* toxic community for obvious reasons.",

Because it sounds like you immediately looked for relationship-potential, while he went for sex-potential.\n\nI\u2019d say to keep stuff tinder anonymous, sex-together, be very open/clear you\u2019re *both* in a relationship, and no side hookups/texting. \n\nOtherwise, you might as well breakup and explore sex/relationships with other people to see if you\u2019re happier... if you\u2019ve been together awhile and don\u2019t want that, maybe consider some couples/sex therapy. \n\nPolyamory really isn\u2019t for \u201cspicing things up in a boring monogamous relationship\u201d, it\u2019s an entirely different animal",

Mark was well aware there was gonna be no sex, because I told him we would not be having sex, which is part of the reason I was so panicked. \n\nHowever, me and my boyfriend will definitely have another discussion about casually dating separately again, and I am thinking that we with both veto this lol. Perhaps in the future, we can think about dating someone together, but I think for now we just realized how lucky we are to have each other and not have to deep dive into the cesspool that is modern dating.

Plenty of people who get body-shamed for things that are much harder to hide than a small penis still manage to be self-confident enough to *not* pull their pants down, unsolicited, in front of somebody because they mistook \"not immediately being rejected\" as consent. \n\nTo be honest, this dude definitely needs some therapy or counseling to help him understand socially acceptable behaviors, on top of building his self-esteem. It's okay if socialization doesn't come easily to you, but he clearly crossed a line. Flashing somebody without consent is a form of sexual assault. You can't blame small dick jokes for that. At some point, far before this, personal accountability comes into play.",

So, time goes on, your isolation grows, your lack of social or romantic success turns you off from using those skills, which means over time they decay if they ever developed in the first place. \n\nThen, you finally seem to make it to the promise land. A girl actually asked you out. Something you had stopped hoping for even in your wildest fantasy. \n\nNot only do you have to try to persevere through your crushing awkwardness. That you can recognize but the more you take notice of it the less you can do about it. You also frontload and drop way too much information in an attempt to be honest with the girl before you both get too involved. \n\nDespite all of this, the unthinkable has happened, you're headed back to a girl's place. Mark knows what the score is. He has read about this. He's psyching himself up. Convincing himself to make his move. So finally, with all this fear and doubt and rejection weighing you down, you leap up and rip off your pants. Only for the girl to immediately begin vomiting. \n\nI see a lot of myself in Mark. We are kindred souls of a certain type. There's no way I don't go home and kill myself within two weeks of that happening. Not saying Mark should. Just saying that would be my reaction.",

Don't let one guy's fuckup ruin the whole thing, unless you're just not comfortable with the lifestyle. Wait a bit and try again. Laugh off the first night as a really shitty date and find someone else.\n\nAlso OP, expect one or both of you will break your ground rules routinely, or at least don't be surprised when you find them kissing (or catch yourself doing things) or something (idk your rules). Knowing it'll happen in the moment will keep you from getting upset when it does.",

Plus, I was a little bit tentative to go the Tinder route and go out with a complete stranger. I would rather go out with someone that I have known for quite a while, and have had amicable interactions with many times.

Just grab a fresh piece off of the main one and you can use the edge of the knife to flatten it further, then continue chopping. The trick is to scape off what sticks to the knife onto a different pile, as only the finest particles are what sticks. Then when you're only left with that pile, repeat the process and again scape off what sticks to the knife after a few chops into a new pile. Eventually you'll have a pile full of very fine powder. Let it sit for a little in a dry room to get rid of extra moisture. Getting it into the container is pretty easy just hold it sideways and push in the garlic powder with the edge of the knife. The powder being pushed in will push the powder already in the container further inside.",

You basically unscrew the top bit and fill that with whatever you\u2019re sniffing, and screw the top back on.\n\nThen you\u2019ve got that little pointed arrow thing in the middle. That is basically a little chamber that has a whole on the side that the arrow points. So when you want to use it, you rotate the arrow so it\u2019s facing into the vial, flip the whole thing upside, and that fills the chamber. The arrow should be facing up.\nYou then hold onto the arrow, and rotate the rest of the bullet so that the arrow is now lined up with the bit you sniff out of.\nThen stick it up your nose and sniff.\n\nThat\u2019s also why I like it so much more for ket too. I really lose finger dexterity for opening up tiny bags after a bit of that lol, but much easier to handle a bullet!",

But she still loved me and she wouldnnever do anything to break our relationship, and she was so worried I would be upset or something... I trusted her, and honestly after only a few minutes of introspection, I found myself supporting and encouraging her. I didn't feel less loved, I felt no jealosy or heartbreak as long as she was still there with me. I realised for me, romantic relationships aren't different from friendships in the sense that people can have several friends, and that shouldn't make you jealous. If my best friend meets some other person and invites them to our online games sometimes, the more the merrier right? Or if my friend tells me about someone they met and spend time doing X activity together, I never did with my friend because I'm not interested in that but they both are having a great time... I won't be jealous, I'll be happy for them. \n\nSo, with partners I feel the same. \n\nIn the end my girlfriend wasn't brave enough to try her shot, and nothing ever happened, and we fell apart years later, but I'm still on friendly terms with her to this day.",

Personally my partner is the love of my life we have been together for 3 years share pretty much everything together and are a happy couple who at the moment plan to spend the rest of our lives together. \n\nNow I will not lie and say \"I'm never jealous\" as that's simply not true. Although the jealousy is not blinding and i consider myself to be very practical. The main reason we are open is because certain needs are unable to be met by just me. And that's okay! Honestly I just cant/dont want to have that much boink time. He does though and honestly it gets annoying. I also want him to be happy. I also want to experiment with other people (I'm bi and have never been with a girl. Guys just some easier to me).\n\nThis might be a weird simile but it's like if I had a roommate take my dog to the park. It's like \"you've been scratching at the door all day I'll just have someone take you hope you have fun!\". But I'd be jealous if my dog ignored me to just love up on my roommate. But in the grand scheme of things that feeling is pretty silly. \n\nAlthough with a partner its different as you can communicate your needs. If I feel jealous I just go \"hay babe I've been dealing with feelings of jealousy can we have some one on one time this weekend\" and generally works out. :)",

Like, I don't care for the idea that if a relationship ends that it \"failed\". I really think that can be damaging to receive involved. Instead, it lasted as long as it was useful to both parties. I don't know about you, but I don't want to be dating someone who is miserable being with me, or vice versa. I'm not afraid of it ending, but I'm definitely broken hearted and sad. Mind you, by the time a relationship is ending, it's usually gotten to be pretty uncomfortable.\n\nAs a person who started identifying as poly at 21, I can tell you I had had the experience of being cheated on before that. I had had the experience of jealousy, and being afraid someone would cheat on me. And it took years of thinking my way through things and trial and error to move past it. I realized that I was more afraid of being lied to about the cheating than the actual cheating itself. After that I realized that the jealousy was a secondary emotion cause by the primary emotion of fear that my partner would leave me. Once I understood that my partner's other relationships did not mean he would end ours (and that was reinforced by my partner's behavior of dating other people and NOT breaking up with me) I didn't feel that kind of jealousy anymore.\n\nI do still feel jealous sometimes, but it's more like feeling left out (like if all your friends went skiing but you couldn't go because you had to work). It's not the gut wrenching fear that things are out of control. And when it happens, we talk about it. I realize I have no right to say \"this hurt me, don't do it\" but something more like, \"I really like that activity too, can we make a plan to do it some time\". And, ultimately, it's important to recognize that you don't have to accept all of your partner's behaviors just because you agreed to be in a relationship. You can negotiate what you're comfortable with, and, ultimately, decide that you want different things and break up (which goes for monogamous relationships too). And that's ok. Sometimes it takes time to learn these things, and sometimes people grow and decide the want new things that are not compatible with their current relationship. And then things end.",

They have two girlfriends outside of me, and I have two boyfriends and a girlfriend, all of which have their own partners. We go out on poly dates, and have poly nights were we get the polycule together and hang out. If any one of us has an issue, the support system is great! One of my boyfriends and I just went to LA for a week to support my girlfriend as she went through surgery. \n\nPoly is FANTASIC and can be an amazing thing for everyone involved. It does, however, take a lot of work and communication. People new to poly are going to start with lots of bad relationships and each one will be a learning experience. If you keep at it, you learn not only how to communicate, but also the correct things to communicate. You learn how to both feel and manage your own emotions. Yes, envy and jealously are a thing, but if you recognize it in yourself, you can work through it and come out a better person in the end. I would say, the same way you don't give up on monogamy just because of a bad date or two, don't give up on Poly just because the people you initially started with gave you a bad experience. Every person you date is going to be different and you will learn something new every time.",

Trying to date together is even harder, creating more drama that you have to navigate, and setting you up for toxic power dynamics which are difficult to avoid and unhealthy for everyone involved. Triads work best when they happen organically with everyone separately falling in love. Not when they're forced.  \n\n\nBut yeah. Regardless if you're single or polyamorous or whatever, dating is really hard. You have to sort through a lot of garbage to find the diamonds in the rough. And the same advice for single people generally applies for polyamorous people too, such as it being a big risk to date people you work with. That can create a negative work environment really easily if things don't work out.  \n\n\nI don't know if y'all will put yourselves out there again or not, but I wish you the best of luck either way.",

But, possessiveness is unhealthy in a relationship, and it should be confronted in order to build a more happy and healthy relationship. You said yourself that you would be unable to handle yourself if you saw a partner with another person. Think about that. You don't own your partner, so how they choose to be intimate with others is not yours to control. They might choose to be monogamous with you, but remember, it's ultimately a choice they're making of their own volition, not a rule you're setting on your partner. If they decide they don't want to be monogamous with you, they can tell you to either accept the love they choose to share with you while acknowledging that you don't own it, or you can choose to have none of their love.\n\nFor me, it's quite simple. I could never call possessiveness love. Any relationship that would impose restrictions on how I love others, any partner who would expect to have sole ownership of my love, is simply not love, it's Stockholm Syndrome.",

You have things like the [penis displacement theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513803000163) which concludes that the shape of the penis was naturally selected for in order to remove the semen of other men (something hardly needed in a truly monogamous pair bond). There is [plenty of research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2050052116300087) out there that shows that mating behavior is individualistic rather than a norm. \n\n\\> Why do so many \"casual hook ups\" or \"FWB\" become relationships? Why do so many people choose to be drunk or high to engage in casual sex? Why does the phrase \"catching feelings\" even exist? \n\nBecause group one exists. Nothing here contradicts my statement. I make no claim that there aren't people that are naturally romantic monogamists, quite the contrary. On the other hand, people sure do have a hard time keeping it in their pants for a species that supposedly just wants to settle down with one person. Estimates of infidelity range from 25, to [46](https://www.healthtestingcenters.com/research-guides/admitting-cheating/), and [all the way up to 75%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-cheating/2012/02/08/gIQANGdaBR_story.html) of people having been unfaithful. One could ask that if pair bonding is so natural, why is fidelity so difficult?\n\n\\> These are hoops we jump through to try and stop the emotional bonds from happening.\n\nAgain, nothing I said is against bonding. The difference is simply that some people require sex for a bond, some don't. You seem to think that the people in the second group are not forming bonds which is far from the case. They absolutely do, it is just that the bond is not contingent on sexual exclusivity. Some form multiple bonds even.\n\n\\> A lot of research suggests that people who choose to engage in frequent casual sex ARE \"emotionally damaged\"\n\nAnd a lot of research suggests otherwise.\n\n\\> Reminds me of climate change debates on TV where you have overwhelming evidence on one side then some shill on the other. \n\nFunny, it reminds me of debates on homosexuality from the 50's and 60s where there is a judgmental twat on one side talking about what is \"natural\" and \"the way things should be\" and conveniently ignoring the plethora of scientific evidence and human experience on the other side.\n\n\\> Polyamory is not a hobby like going to the gym and knitting where you can start, then stop if it's not for you at no cost. If it's not for you, it will HURT.\n\nThe same is true for monogamy.",

If it was truly effective at removing semen, men would be removing their own semen too. Semen runs out on its own as it thins, and only a very tiny amount of sperm, proportionally, even make it through the cervix, and the cervix being coated is really all that is needed.\n\nI think it's much more likely that it assists in removing the acidic build up in the vagina that occurs naturally from the bacteria, and is replaced with more alkaline fluid as she becomes aroused. This would help create a less hostile environment for sperm, which are very sensitive to acid.\n\nThe guy who came up with the idea also believed men would patiently wait in line for the guy in front to 'finish', while more men were drawn to the sounds of her moans (and is why he believes women moan more and we all find those sounds so sexy). Ultimately, his idea is that early human mating habits boiled down to 'men running trains' on women whenever they were horny, and their moans of pleasure would draw even more men. This sounds more like he is projecting his own kink and perception of women than anything to do with science.\n\nSide note: And then there are the people that always bring up bonobos in these discussions, and make erroneous claims that they are our closest relatives to support this idea that humans' natural state is that of free mating. Meanwhile, it ignores that we are just as related to chimps as we are to bonobos... and we unfortunately share a lot ***more*** similarities with chimps.",

The premise also seems to be at odds with itself because, while sperm displacement isn't an uncommon strategy, all of the animals that actually use sperm displacement are highly combative with other males around mating. So while it's possible that sperm displacement is a strategy used in early humans, it would imply that communal mating probably was not.",

It makes her feel sexy. And aside from me setting up some elaborate catfishing online for her, there\u2019s no way that I can give that feeling to her. She did also state that I am enough for her (which I still believe), but anything else would just be more gravy on top. Being that I had spent all my several decades of dating as a loyal monogamist, not to mention vaccines weren\u2019t readily available yet, we took our time and worked through it slowly, she letting me set the pace and get my feet wet first, so to speak.\n\nAnd before anyone jumps to the conclusion that I was coerced into this lifestyle (thanks Jada!), the main draw for me was that I\u2019m a bit of a satyromaniac and though my wife\u2019s drive is higher than normal, it doesn\u2019t come close to my own which could lead to frustration for both parties.",

What about love requires that it be confined to one person? Does a parent having another child diminish their love for their existing kids? When you make another friend, do you diminish your love for the ones you have? \n\n>why do they want to be happy with someone else? \n\nWhy not? Same logic applies. \n\n>Imo if another partner is what they want another partner is what they should have. What's the point in dating someone that isn't satisfied with you alone?\n\nWhat's the point of only dating one person? Again: more love is more love! \n\nI realize these questions seem flippant, but I'm trying to get across the point that your responses are arbitrary, and don't appear to arise from any process or logic--you're just saying \"I feel x\". Which is totally fine! A negative response to your partner dating someone else is 100% *normal*, in the least pejorative sense. But it's not *obvious*, especially to those of us who've chosen differently. \n\n> (I don't mean to project onto your relationship but idk how to word the questions in a way that doesn't. I hope you can look past that, I'm sure you're very happy together in your own way)\n\nNo offense taken! We're extraordinarily happy. My life fucking rocks :)",

Doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t love my partner who I have been with for many years. I\u2019m okay with my partner not having a degree and doing a job he really enjoys, I just didn\u2019t want him to use our savings for what essentially seems like gambling lol. After we both calmed down and I explained it in that way from my perspective, he was a lot more understanding about it. I\u2019d rather have that money in one of my savings funds or accounts than just poof, gone. It is hard in any relationship to understand that you\u2019re not the greatest at everything. He\u2019s not the greatest at money management. I\u2019m not the greatest at handling strong emotions and overreacting. But we are okay with each other\u2019s flaws, and we know enough about each other to cope with issues that do come up \u2764\ufe0f",

It varies from individual to individual, and couple to couple, and polycule to polycule.  \n\n\nIt's not all about sex. People connect in different ways with different people.  I have two committed partners (The three of us are in a relationship with the three of us and no one outside of the three of us, by mutual consent).  I have a great deal in common with both my wives, but what those things are are different depending on which wife you're talking about.  \n\n\nThey, in turn, have plenty in common with each other that I don't have in common with either one of them.  Such as a deep and abiding love for Korean dramas (which is one of the ways they spend quality time with each other).  \n\n\nWhile my relationship is a bit unusual in the poly community (Being a closed triad), the basic principles apply in more common polyamorous relationships.  People may fall in love with all of you, but it's nice to have someone who reflects that part of you.  Also, it's a lot of pressure to expect some individual person to be your everything.  \n\n\nBut they can still be the person you build your 'home' around.  That's what a nesting partner is.  You build a home together, a life together, they're USUALLY the one you have children with, etc.   \n\n\nAnother answer: Because it works for them, so who cares?",

The bond between parent and kids is better compared to that between siblings. It's wrong to pretend sex doesn't effect your emotional connection between people. \n\nYou're not wrong, sex deepens emotional connection. But--in my experience--once I eschewed the *fear* that my partner would leave me if they slept with someone else, I stopped seeing a difference in the kinds of love I shared with others *that was relevant to whether or not anyone was my favorite*. Some of my partners are more compatible sexually with me than others, some fuck me in a particular way that's awesome, but that I only want once in a blue moon, some I have a deep connection with in a totally non-sexual, but still romantic sense. There are a thousand different axes on which you can love a person. \n\n>I'm not a parent either but I know from my own parents and the parents of my friends that they usually have a favourite they just would never say it out loud and the middle child is usually left unattended. \n\nI've heard this to. When pressed, you can usually find an aspect of that middle child they love more than that aspect among their other kids. \n\n>I'm glad you're having fun with your relationship but you can't deny it's a very high maintenance lifestyle. \n\nOh yes. A joke in the poly community is that it's really just a Google Calendar fetish. Apart from the scheduling, more people means more opportunity for conflict, more talking about feelings. However, the vast majority of the people I go on dates with are more emotionally mature than the average monogamist (I suspect because they've all spent a lot of time having exactly these sorts of conversations), so it's not nearly as heavy on the emotional processing as you'd think. \n\n>I assume you don't see some of your partners as much as you'd like and have felt left out sometimes?\n\nNot really, and not in a sense that's different than if they were simply busy with work or on vacation. That is, I just miss them.",

A might find themselves wanting if they committed to someone who was only passionate about one of those things.

For some people, it can make sense to satisfy this need through a third person in a purely BDSM relationship.\n\nAll of this presupposes that you're the kind of person who enjoys (or at least tolerates) seeing a partner with another person, a feeling also known as compersion.",

If one of those dates had gone really well and she wanted to sleep with that person, I wouldn\u2019t expect her to call me to check first (tho I would like her to tell me afterward). Same goes with my wife and I. We can\u2019t just go around picking up randos from the street. Interestingly enough, tho, is that she (my wife) is totally fine if the gf & I wanted to have a threesome or explore swinging (neither of which I\u2019ve ever experienced, funny enough).\n\nAs for the first two questions, when we were first just ENM and dating around, there were some tough times when communication went a bit awry that made me feel pangs of want to return to \u201csimpler days,\u201d but we were able to talk through all that and resolve any issues that may have arisen. Otherwise, I feel my wife and I are more intimate these days. Though I love what I have with my gf, it has made me appreciate the relationship my wife and I have cultivated over the years even more.\n\nAs for my gf\u2019s feelings, I can\u2019t answer fully for her, obviously, but I know she has felt \u201cleft out of my life\u201d on occasion. As a default, I don\u2019t involve people in the mundane aspects of my day to day, but apparently that makes her happy and feel more connected, so I\u2019ve gotten better at looping her in to the mild annoyances, random coincidences and other small bits of my life.",

I'm all for people doing whatever they want, but most people (including most poly people) are fully aware that there are many potential pitfalls if one decides to go down that path. \n\n\nAnd FWIW, they have mental health issues because they're growing up in a really fucked up and confusing time period (in a lot of ways)... it's not something they did to themselves, and even if it was, that'd be on their parents for being so inattentive. \n\n\nIdk man, this comment is just kinda sad. Like always, it's pointless, misguided, and incorrect to blame \"kids these days\" for the problems they face. The problems that \"kids these days\" face are almost always the fault of whoever are \"adults these days\", since they're the ones that made the environment those kids are being raised in. Its ridiculous to blame kids for much of anything, anyway (beyond whatever they literally do themselves, like putting gum in little Sally's hair or whatever). \n\nFrom what I can tell, it's not even definite that kids DO have more mental problems \"these days\"... we might just be better at diagnosing it. I think it's probably a little of both (and undoubtedly there's some other causes we arent even aware of yet). But regardless, that's not a bad thing. As our standard of living gets better, we can *afford* to focus on \"smaller\" issues that dont impact as many people. That's a GOOD thing, and yet so many people are convinced that since they have a decent life, everyone has an equal opportunity at life... but that's just plainly untrue. I'm just rambling at this point, but the growing lack of empathy I've seen among the right wing [in the U.S.] over the past decade is truly alarming. We're at the point where many people genuinely view kindness or generosity as a weakness, and thats.... that's probably not good.",

Everyone knows about everyone, some of them get along so well they go out for bowling and have board game nights together as friends.\n\nI am also a part of the social kinky scene where I live, and that will generally speaking require a lot more conscious introspection and demands an ability to speak your mind openly without waiting until shit hits the fan.\n\nFor those few it concerns, this is as valid as monogamy is to the most of us.\n\nI cannot see myself ever feeling truly settled and fulfilled if me and/or my partner should have others, and cannot see it ever being worth the effort to have healthy relationships with more than one person.\n\nThey're thriving just like any healthy, comitted, long term relationship tends to help people do.\n\nThere is a huge difference between people wanting to fuck around and not be called a cheater, but basically cheating without guilt, and polyamory. \n\nThose that have the want for several romantic relationships feel the same way most of us do about enjoying more than 1 friendship at a time. Most of us cultivate more friendships than 1 if we can, and we aren't actively rejecting the idea of getting to know more than 1 friend. That's what it's like for them regarding relationships.\n\nAlso, polyamory is not the same as swinging. That is, having no-strings-attached sex with others outside the relationship. Plenty of committed monogamous people see nothing wrong with letting lose in that way, as long as they both go home together at the end of the evening and stay loyal, honest, and commuted to each other in every aspect other than their swingers meet ups.\n\nIt's not for me, but these people look like your average upper management, store clerk, teacher, car mechanic, legal assistant, incredibly nerdy computer engineer, just to mention a few of the occupations I know of from the local scene here. Some of whom are swingers.\n\nThe most dedicated couple live in an upper middle class area, have a nice garden that is charmingly overgrown, but kept like that, they have barbecues with their neighbours, and also enjoy a healthy social life with lots of hosting (pre-covid).\n\nOts just that some of those dinner parties are actually sex parties, or kink parties, and others are purely for socialising. There not much overlap between the groups either.\n\nThey have kids that have mostly fled the nest by now, and the raunchy parties have always been done when their kids have been with their grandparents for the weekend etc.\n\nRegular people with steady jobs, steady lives.\n\nIt's just normal people do ung things differently from the main stream way, even some as old as to almost be the boomer generation. You'll never know who it is just by looking at them.\n\nMost definitely not just mentally ill people. Research has shown that there is a slight tendency towards kinky people being mentally healthier, as they are more practiced at introspective thought and how to effectively speak their experiences and feelings. Instead of repressing.",

You don't have to, and you do not, share my own stance and the stance of the majority. A society based in polygamy is a society doomed to fail, which is why monogamy absolutely prevails.",

I\u2019m deeply committed - just multiply so.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to understand why you don\u2019t think I should be able to tell my coworkers about the restaurant I went to with my girlfriend over the weekend, judgment free. \n\nIt\u2019s even more difficult for me to understand why people think a global culture of serial monogamy (with more than occasional cheating) is more morally evolved than ethical non-monogamy. \n\nI accept that I\u2019m not going to change your mind and frankly am not interested in arguing. But I want to be clear, both for your sake and for anyone else reading: You probably know more people in healthy, happy polyamorous relationships than you think.",

I have been in some amazingly fulfilling relationships, but the monogamous ones were always lacking something. I no longer feel like that.\n\nAs a member of the LGBTQ community in other respects, in terms of feelings I can absolutely equate the two times I have come out. In terms of the societal acceptance etc they're different but share quite a bit. E.g. I can pass in the street with one partner, and that's very convenient at times.\n\nFor some people it's a choice, like when a monogamous bi/pansexual person settles down with any one person (as in they choose a gender to be with, rather than choose whether to be bi/pan, which obviously is not a choice). For others on either end of the spectrum it isn't.\n\nThere's mono people all across this thread who say they could never be poly, and no one is giving them shit for that. I'm saying the opposite and I'm being told I am a terrible person for it by others. I realise that wasn't your argument, but I didn't choose this. I do often wish I wasn't poly, and I hate that I feel that way too.\n\nI agree polyamorous relationships are a societal construct, as are any others in any modern sense. We innately seek out partners, but marriage and long term monogamy is a choice. As is any kind of organised polyamory. However the feelings behind it are not a social construct, and it's important to differentiate. People telling me my feelings are not valid or real, and that I need to choose something else reminds me a lot of the bi erasure that is so rampant in modern society and it hurts.\n\nI might not be able to change your mind, but maybe you could take a little time to understand the perspective.",

      "text": "In my opinion polygamous relationships only work when it's \"natural\" or \"honest\" polygamy. \n\nWhat I mean by that, is when your honest feelings about your relationship are not based around the concept of contract and possession. \"Natural polygamy\" is also when you sincerely have chemistry and a connection with another human. \n\nMy opinion is honest polygamy is not a method to explore and sleep with other people. It is a means of honoring your true feelings, and sharing an intimate relationship with those who share a genuine connection.\n\nThese connections are not merely lustful, and they also may not be stronger than your relationship with your permanent life partner. My concept is about honoring your truth in an open and loving way. \n\nSomething like:\n-Do you love your life partner? Yes.\n-Do you love another as well? Yes.\n-Does your love for another affect your love for your life partner? No. \n\nIt's not a means of \"having your cake and eating it too.\" It's more centered around _not_ using your relationship as a contract to lie about how you actually feel, and treating your friendships and relationships with open intimacy. And it should NEVER be approached with compromise. You're either pursuing honest feelings or you're just looking for an outlet for your monogamous relationship, which is neither healthy nor what I would call a good model of polygamy.\n\nMy advice is to be open, but not seek too intentionally. Its about honesty, not a free pass at cheating. You may even find a connection with someone your life partner really respects and also may have a healthy friendship with. I've been in an open relationship based around this concept. Often my wife and partner will buddy up and be chatting and shopping like I'm not even there. They genuinely care about each other and there's no possession when it comes to me. One of them wants to live their life with me and pay bills as a family, and the other is a very good friend I love very much. And it's been the same with partners and friends of hers. Everyone loves everyone else and it is never an outlet or alternate expression to get a break from my life partner. Everyone is just very honest and open without jealousy. \n\nObviously not for everyone, and truthfully hard to create if it's not just how you sincerely feel to begin with.",

I date long term.\n\nPoly is deep end stuff. Been in this life 30+ years and just trying it out NOW in the last few years. The solo dating is more my wife and I's speed.\n\nMy wife has had terribad dates quite often. Many of my FWBs say the same. I've have had less so and I think it's because I date ppl I know for awhile and take it slow-ish. I like to vet ppl to reduce drama and to make sure compatibility is strong.\n\nIf and when you do try it again, I highly suggest as a couple you just check (don't participate on the first day) your local sex+ scene as an observer. You have sex+ clubs and spots - this is not SEX CLUBS - more like a place to hang out, watch a performance and listen to music while surrounded by ppl in the life...These places often have education days about various topics and/or kinks. Sex clubs are usually catering to a kink where smashing will be taking place on the premises in various formats with security and/or safety checks in place.\n\nIf you decide to solo date again, take it slow and try to get with ppl that ID as ENM, open and/or poly as you will probably have less issues since more ppl on dating apps and in the dating scene may be mono and looking for monogamy which you and your partner can not provide.\n\nThough your story reminds of the movie hall pass or some other one like it.",

Tom let me know that this was not negotiable, and just wanted to make sure I wasn\u2019t \u201cone of those women\u201d who wanted a man to support her ...\n\n> He said he was actually hoping that I would allow him access to my salary after I pay my loans off to start up his own business. \n\nSo your \"partner\" is now a leech who wants to live off of your money.\n\nAnd he is tired of your body so he wants to play around.\n\nAnd in another posting you write:\n\n> I tend to prefer doctor/lawyer/researcher types. Someone who has similar professional interests, salary range, and education. I just find it really fun to be able to deep dive into complex and interesting topics, and to have someone who can really relate to my day life and struggles.\n\nSo this \"partner\" does not meet any of what you want from a partner.\n\nWhy not just break up?

You learn from it and next time know to lock your doors. \n\nThere is an attitude by many that either ONLY blames the person who left their door unlocked and says \"well they deserved it because they left their door unlocked\". No they did not. OR people who say \"Aww huny, we just need to teach people not to steal\". As if that is ever going to work.\n\nWhat we need is to continue to hold thiefs accountable, and discouraging people from being thieves, but understand that there will simply always be thieves. Simultaneously we need to work on being vigilant and protecting ourselves from thieves, by doing things like getting locks, security systems, and limiting how often we invite strangers into our home. Understand that when you throw a party for example, you are taking a risk and something is likely to get broken or stolen, it's just a fact of life.",

I started laughing because Tom doesn\u2019t know anything about investing. He is objectively terrible with money. I immediately pointed out several instances in which I had to bail him out due to his lack of financial planning, that he can\u2019t even get approved for a secured credit card, and that he ignored my advice for years about needing to get serious about budgeting and how he spent money.\n\nOP is with someone who is only interested in being with OP for OP's money.\n\nThe grass would be greener being single.",

It's all about making sure you have a real connection with the person first not just \"Well, they seem nice.\" Also helps to meet up a few times for dinner or just to hang out with no expectation of sex unless things go REALLY well. If there's no sexual spark at first, hey, at least you have new friends and maybe things will get sexy later on.\n\nIf you guys aren't scared off by the experience, there are plenty of swinger sites out there where you can meet normal people/couples who would almost 100% guarantee you a better experience.",

You never know what you\u2019re gonna get, it\u2019s a lot harder than just hopping around in high school and college! \n\nAnyway, what I REALLY wanted to get at is the boundaries comment. Yes, you set boundaries, and made it work with respect for each other. AWESOME. Seriously, good first step. \n\nNow. Things change over time. What was once okay, can become not. What was once not okay, can become a favorite. For example, when we started, it was fair game with ex\u2019s. Now that we\u2019re married, ex\u2019s are a no. I *love* to have a guy finish deepthroat, it\u2019s a thing, whatever. When we started, hubby was against it for others. That\u2019s fine, we all have limits and I respect that. I didn\u2019t ask for it, but he saw how much I loved it and started to become open to the idea of incorporating it into our open relationship. \n\nBoundaries can and will change over time. Up and down, wider narrower, whatever you want to say. Y\u2019all got a bad deal on the first attempt, and guess what, that\u2019s WICKED common. \n\nTry looking at match/tinder for couples, and give any swingers bars in your area a shot. Go with an open mind, but just know that a LOT of the people you\u2019ll run into are not our age (we\u2019re also similar in age to you). Usually a fair bit older, just an FYI. BUT, you\u2019ll probably run into some younger couples and sometimes end up in a younger bar. Nowadays, we don\u2019t bother with the swinger \u201cscene\u201d, we just go to college bars and meet people, or have our regular FWB types.",

Go with that intention.    Poly often refers to love.

I've always thought that polyamory is just people in relationships they are too insecure to leave because they don't know how to be alone so they just try to find someone else first. If you aren't happy with who you are with and think dating more people is the fix that's like having a child or adopting a dog, you two are the issue. \n\nBefore I get attacked, I'm not condemning these relationships, I just think it makes no sense. I get some people want different things out of life, but almost every time I hear about polyamory it's someone who wants to be able to fuck other people while staying with the person they claim to love. They want an open excuse to cheat.",

They like to play with their parents and chairs. As a kid (almost everyone?) I was still angry. But Mark says he'll be back. I did not find the words to say. Marco loves it. I think this is my favorite place.\n\nEveryone knows this is impossible. Mark took my hand, took a picture, got up from his chair and ordered lunch. I was shocked because I did not know he was asleep. I have friends I want to meet, but I want to meet There is nothing to be ashamed of.

Polyamory for MOST participants is all about sex. This is true both in circles of people who understand and live the polyamorous lifestyle as well as \"newbies\" who hear \"oh, so and so is polyamorous? Well then I'll date them.\" If you are joining polyamory for some reason other than sex - *especially* as a woman - I'm saying you are going to have a hard time indeed finding that.",
