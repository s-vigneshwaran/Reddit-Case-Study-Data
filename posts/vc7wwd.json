A set of odd numbers and a set of even numbers can be mapped 1-1 with the set of natural numbers. i.e. the set of even numbers can be defined as 2n, where n is a whichever natural number, while odd numbers can be defined as 2n - 1. Therefore the sets of odd numbers and even numbers are both countable, and so they are the same size as eachother and the same size as the set of natural numbers. \n\nThe set of real numbers however cannot have a 1-1 relationship with the set of natural numbers, and is therefore a larger infinity than the set of natural numbers. This has been proven by mathematicians, you can look into the papers yourself if you want a more technical explanation of how this works.\n\n>There are no greater or lesser infinities.\n\nYou can go argue with mathematicians about this, but I imagine you would not be able to convince them.",

(Feel free to blindly disagree at this point, as I generally expect that from religious folks, be they mathematicians or theists.)\n\nHence why Hilbert's Grand Hotel thought experiment is a paradox. Often, paradox are things \"easily\" proven mathematically while remaining false in practice.\n\nA good understanding of maths allows you to know a lot of theories within a field, as any decent technician would. The true mathematician knows that some proofs are not designed to be built on, but rather to accentuate the imperfection of the absolute theories.",
