They are conflating (2*3)^2 with (2+3)^2 .\n\nWith the first one, whether you do the multiplication within the parentheses first or you distribute the exponent first makes no difference, because exponents are multiplication. As you can see:\n\n(2*3)^2 = (6)^2 = 36\n\n(2\\*3)^2 = 2^2 * 3^2 = 4*9 = 36\n\nThe problem is this does not work for addition. You can\u2019t distribute an exponent into addition because exponents are not addition. If you want to do the exponent first (in fact you don\u2019t, but whatever) you have to do what the previous commenter mentioned, which is turning (2+3)^2 into (2+3)\\*(2+3), and from there it\u2019s obviously 5*5.",

Does the pronunciation change basing on the following word, as it happens with\u00a0the, or are there other\u00a0rules?\n\nAnswer\n\nIt is pronounced /\u02c8h\u00e6f t\u0259/ when it acts as a semi-modal, equivalent to must, AND the two words fall together. In all other circumstances it is pronounced as /\u02c8h\u00e6v t\u0259/.\n\nADD: Actually, the\u00a0to\u00a0in /\u02c8h\u00e6v t\u0259/ will in most cases be pronounced /t\u1d7f/, but that\u2019s a very minor point.\n\n\u2003I\u00a0/\u02c8h\u00e6f t\u0259/\u00a0tell you the truth: I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\n\u2003I\u00a0/\u02c8h\u00e6v/, /t\u0259/\u00a0tell you the truth, no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\n\u2003We\u00a0/\u02c8h\u00e6v/ /t\u0259/\u00a0the left, the Colosseum; /t\u0259/ the right, the Arch of Constantine.\n\u2003We\u00a0/\u02c8h\u00e6v/ /t\u0259/\u00a0that end instituted a new policy.\n\u2003I\u00a0/\u02c8h\u00e6f t\u0259/\u00a0go to Ottawa tomorrow.\n\u2000?I\u00a0/\u02c8h\u00e6v/, /t\u0259/\u00a0my dismay, to go to Ottawa tomorrow.\n\nYou\u2019re very unlikely to hear the last one. It\u2019s not formally \u201cincorrect\u201d, but only a very literate speaker or writer, familiar with similar uses of full modals, would think that\u00a0have to\u00a0might be be deployed with an adverbial between the auxiliary and the lexical verb; and only a speaker or writer with a tin ear would allow himself to do so.\"\n\nhttps://englishvision.me/when-is-have-to-pronounced-%CB%88haef-t%C9%99/",

The exponent just denotes the number of serial products of the base.\n\nIn the case of (2+3)^2 you have a term (2+3) as the base.  You can process this problem in one of two ways.\n\n1. Simplify the term in the base, then exponentiate\n\n2. Exponentiate, then simplify the terms.\n\nYou can simplify the terms in one of two ways\n\n2a. Since it's simple addition of integers, you can just add them together and get 5, a.k.a. (2+3)^2 = (2+3)(2+3) = 5 x 5\n\n2b. For a more generalized case (if a variable were involved), you would distribute the binomial product (2+3)(2+3) in a way that is commonly taught as FOIL (First pair, Outside pair, Inside pair, Last pair). This is where you get 2(2) + 2(3) + 3(2) + 2(2) that the other commenter was showing you.",

There is definitely a struggle with algebra among the average college student, which means there are huge struggles with algebra among the average American.\n\nThe core problem, as I see it, is that people forget or never really got to the point of understanding what all this notation means. It's really a struggle with arithmetic. *Everything* can be brought back to addition, which I think is the core piece of understanding arithmetic and algebra. **Exponentiation is shorthand notation for multiplication. Multiplication is shorthand notation for addition.**\n\nFor example, 3^4 = 3 \u2022 3 \u2022 3 \u2022 3. Now, to someone that knows math, that's obvious. But most people don't know what these notations *actually* mean, so in their brain exponentiation is something completely unique and they don't see 3^4 as 3 \u2022 3 \u2022 3 \u2022 3. And it matters to know what exponentiation mean, because it becomes trivial to know what 3^4 \u2022 3^3 = 3^7, since 3^4 * 3^3 = 3 \u2022 3 \u2022 3 \u2022 3 \u2022 3 \u2022 3 \u2022 3. Point being that when you want to work with exponents, all you really have to remember is that exponentiation is shorthand for multiplication. You don't have to memorize all these rules for how to work with exponents. You just have to remember what exponentiation represents. \n\nWhen you know what exponentiation does, then it becomes easy to remember algebra formulas. Hell, algebra formulas STOP feeling like formulas. For example (2 + 3)^2 = (2 + 3)(2 + 3) = (5)(5) = 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5. Exponentiation is shorthand notation for multiplication. Multiplication is shorthand notation for addition.",

Definitely. Zero? No.\n\nFor that to be the case would require breakthroughs in many steps of material excavation and refining and manufacture and shipping and a huge expansion of electric power generation (probably through nuclear, since its EROI is much higher than solar and wind and therefore will be more affordable, and it generates consistent power for reliable base load).",
