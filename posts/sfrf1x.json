Once a woman gets pregnant their body starts making the hcg hormone. Its almost like smelling when a girl is on her period but way stronger and her natural scent is amplified 10 fold too. It makes a unique scent that is the same for all of them no matter what they smell like naturally. Like do you have a girl? You know what she smells like normally. You can get little wifs of things when she walks by if you pay attention. I have a few friends that can do it. I thought it was weird when i first realized it. Asked one of my exes if she was on her period. She smelled off when he sat near me.  Idk why i thought period but an hour later it happened.",
