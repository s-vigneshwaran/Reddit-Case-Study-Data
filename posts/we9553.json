You\u2019re both right. The names of streets *do* matter, because they continue to lend credence and government sanction of traitors who literally started a war. What our government does and says, matters. People look to our government for moral guidance. If you need an example of this, look up pre- and post-Obergefell polls concerning same sex marriage. If our government implicitly condones the behavior of Jefferson Davis by honoring him with streets (or highways!) named after him, it continues to endorse the ideals he espoused while drafting teenagers to die so they could *possibly someday own another person*.
