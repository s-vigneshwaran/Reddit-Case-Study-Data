He's a Republican talking about pushing in some group that will come out with the result he would want - that Google and other \"big tech\" companies are somehow biased against today's right wing.  It's a very specific talking point among right-wingers and because he hadn't found the results of \"a study\" that he wanted, he was ignoring all the outside, independent analysis that had actually been done.  (Given that google's search results are public, it shouldn't be surprising that independent groups had actually looked at the issue.)\n\nThat Republican would NOT want a normal government body to do the analysis because that would not guarantee the results that Republicans want to generate.  And because google search results are right out there in public, a government body could analyze them any time they wanted, a Senator doesn't have to ask google's permission or pressure google to accept intrusive, inside analysis like that.\n\nWhat this guy was clearly trying to push is some sort of \"give MY selected group inside access to Google.\" That Republican senator wanted something like Media Research Center/NewsBusters (\"dedicated to exposing & combating liberal media bias,\") or Project Veritas to do the \"independent analysis.\"",

If your IP changes, since you are changing your triangulation and you may get a new tower with better signal to connect, they can also estimate how are you moving through a city (or any region with several antennas).\n\nBut if your IP changes, how do they know you are still you? Because of your browser, addons and OS fingerprints you spread while you browse the internet.\n\nWe could also talk about AMP, i'm not an expert on this one since it's relatively new, but it's another profiling bullshit.\n\nThey don't have skynet, but they are one of the top5 biggest companies in the world and their business model is based on gathering data.",

I'm gonna be rude because people like you that don't know what the fuck they are talking about need to be put in their place a little.\n\nThere is no such thing as a 'publicised hearing.' That might be some UK shit, I dunno. But this isn't the UK. So if you're from the UK or some other country, why you'd try to educate anyone on the US system is beyond me. Especially when it's obvious you've done no research on this, nor have done any schooling on it. You're just basement dwelling and throwing out random shit wasting everyone's time.\n\nIf you're an American that can't spell publicized, that's a new set of issues as someone familiar with US congress would know how to spell publicize. \n\nNext, there is no such thing as publicized or publicizing or any other spelling of hearings. All hearings are public by default. If you knew anything about this topic you'd know this and this wouldn't even be coming up at all. \n\nNext, in ***none*** of congressional documents is the purpose of a hearing to ask what the public wants asked, nor is it what they are supposed to do.\n\nThe only time they do that shit is when it's a topic that brings a bunch of cameras to the hearing, and will likely be shown on TV / shared on the internet, like this one is. \n\nIf you had ever attended these hearings you'd know how different they are when they don't have a million cameras and it's on a topic no one cares about. Maybe you should try that, then you'd see the difference real quick.",

Worked in the iron industry. Became an ironmaster. Eventually was a partner in a successful iron business.  \n\n\nGeorge Ross of Pennsylvania was the son of a minister, and one of a large family, so he probably did not grow up very well off. He took the bar at age 20 and became a successful lawyer, Crown Prosecutor, provincial legislator.  \n\n\nBenjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania was not educated beyond the age of 10. He became an apprentice printer at the age of 12. By the time he signed the declaration of Independence he was quite well off as a printer and publisher. He had also held many public offices.  \n\n\nRobert Treat Paine of Massachusetts was the son of a minister. Although educated at Harvard, he spent 6 or 8 years as a sailor in merchant ships to build up his poor health, before returning to Massachusetts, taking the bar, and becoming a lawyer.  \n\n\nWilliam Whipple of New Hampshire, grew up none too well off in Kittery, Maine. In his early teens he went to sea as a sailor before the mast. By age 21 he had become a Ship Master. He saved considerable money in this profession, and when he was 28 became a merchant in Portsmouth.  \n\n\nStephen Hopkins of Rhode Island, born in 1707 was apparently of modest background and self educated. He became speaker of the Rhode Island Assembly.  \n\n\nWilliam Floyd of New York was a farmer. His family\u2019s farm on long island was established and fairly prosperous, but William\u2019s father died when he was in his teens, and he had to work hard to keep the farm going and make it prosperous again.  \n\n\nGeorge Walton of Virginia became an orphan at an early age. His uncle apprenticed him as a carpenter as soon as he was old enough. He was admitted to the bar when he was 33.  \n\n\nAbraham Clark of New Jersey grew up on a small farm. He taught himself mathematics and became a surveyor. He then taught himself law, passed the bar and became a land lawyer.  \n\n\nJohn Hart of New Jersey helped his father build a farm from scratch where no one had yet farmed. By the time he inherited it it had become prosperous.  \n\n\nRoger Sherman of Connecticut grew up on what was then the frontier on a wilderness farm in Stoughton. He had very little education. He started out as a cobbler, but taught himself surveying, became a surveyor, taught himself law and took the bar. He also opened the first store in New Milford, Connecticut.\n\nhttp://www.ushistory.org/declaration/signers/",

Would you hire a guy who used to own a company breeding horses? The answer is no. That guy has knowledge that is becoming outdated in real time. He has no point of reference for how motors work or how the newly created assembly line functions. It took roughly 30 years, until the late 20s to the early 30s, before the automobile was widely adopted and almost completely replaced horses as the main form of transportation in the country.\n\nFast forward to society adopting the internet as an integral piece of technology for society to function. That moment was nearly 30 years ago now, in the mid to late 90s. The people who would have grown up with this technology, the ones with the greatest understanding of it, would be those old enough to have developed cognitive abilities before the internet became widely adopted, but still young enough to have learned about it in school, so essentially anyone born in the 80s. Of the 438 members of the US House of Representatives, only 40 were born in 1980 or later. Of the 100 members of the US Senate, only ONE meets this criteria. That means that of the 538 total members of Congress, only 7.6% could even be presumed to have a fundamental understanding of the internet. The rest would presumably have had to taken class or rely on others to do things for them. 92.4% of lawmakers in this country don't have a fundamental understanding of the single most integral technology for modern society to function, and they don't think that's a problem.",

Yes, if you're using Google's GPS on your phone where you can see exactly where you are and can be given directions then they will of course know where you are. That's the point. Google also now deletes location history by default, but that's a fairly recent change (some time last year, previously they'd keep it unless you changed your setting to have them delete it). \n\nBut yeah, you're already capable of making the answer to that question \"no,\" it just depends on how you use your phone and your settings.",

This extended time, of course, will take away time from a following, younger generation. So the effect is somewhat two fold in it's imbalance in representation.\n\nThis can be due to later generations voting less, suppression tactics targeting later generations, or other extraneous circumstances that make it harder for later generations to vote (working, for instance, since voting day is still not a holiday and mail in is still not a legal requirement).\n\nSo the previous comment isn't exactly stating the obvious. It's a unique factor of the current old guard that it would rather make voting difficult and literally die before it handed the reins to the newer generation .",

It's not just arbitrary years picked by someone that determines the spread of a generation, it's things like technology and sociology which can come into effect. Like why Boomers are called Boomers, being part of the post war baby boom. That was an event that was then named after the fact. \n\nIt's about something significant that affects people within that age bracket. That's why they're classified as things like Gen X, Y, and Z first, but later get a named attached. Like Gen Z being called Zoomers. Ironically the name happened before the widespread use of Zoom for school... And Millennials got the name from being in their more formative years (about ages 6-20) at the turn of the millennium.\n\nIIRC there are places that break down those large brackets into smaller brackets to more precisely break down the 'mini' generations within the larger ones. But there's no denying that you'll always relate to someone born in '96 more than '06, even once they're adults as well. You and the '96er will have more in common to relate to each other through even if you're on opposite ends of the generational spectrum.\n\nAnd that's what it is, really. A spectrum of time, and spectrums can be a PITA to properly break down into chunks. Which is where those more notable events that take place in their youth are used as generation defining things.",

Voters don't evaluate politicians on that level, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is that voters really don't have the time to even adequately research the issues and what specifics their representatives have been up to.\n\nSo what they are doing here is what voters evaluate them on, they're creating a stunt to gain attention and press coverage and create narratives that voters will evaluate them for with the end-goal of getting/retaining voter support. Now they have other goals as well, and some other actions that support those goals, and sometimes they overlap. So I'm not saying they only have the one goal to get voter support, but in this particular case that's largely what I'd view this type of stunt attempting to accomplish. It may also be corporate interests against Google pushing for such an agenda as well.",

The rep knows the answer but is playing politics that is obviously geared towards censorship, considering all the book banning going on and they attack net neutrality, and that's just what authoritarianism governments do, so I'm not sure why anyone is considering from a perspective where they might possibly be looking to legislate for the good of society.\n\nThe OP is too dumb to understand the answer though, sure, which is why they'll be emotionally attached to beliefs instead of rationally attached to knowledge.",

If you hire a consulting firm to do some work for you as a business it probably costs way more than that, why shouldn't a lobbying operation cost similar? They have to pay for employees, office space, etc. Is there undue influence with unsavory things like elaborate golf vacations and what have you? Yeah. But they're not buying a senator for a few million dollars for God's sake. Also, reminder than trade unions lobby the government too. So do charity organizations and NGOs.\n\nAnd besides, a US senator's vote would cost way more than a few million. Take net neutrality as an issue, for example. With AT&T and Google on opposite sides of this issue, how would there not be a bidding war for every senator if there was truly open bribery like this old conspiracy theory suggests? 9 million wouldn't even be the starting bid for what's at stake. And  on top of that, 9 million is the [total that Alphabet Inc. spent](https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/clients/summary?id=D000067823) on all federal lobbying, not just one senator. For comparison, the Sierra Club [spent about 4 million in 2020](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/sierra-club/summary?id=D000000259). Is Congress bought and sold by the Sierra Club?",

Which is very much not true. Mobility is essential to the system and allowing it to continue despite major flaws.\n\n\nThe issue is that this mobility is making people think the system is fine. If there were no possibility for class mobility, then people would become frustrated at the system and those at the top. However, if you make mobility possible (but super improbable) you functionally achieve the same goals as disallowing mobility- but also give people \"hope\".\n\n\nAdditionally, the elite are not stupid. They want the best people working for them. To find these people, they need a system that allows the best to rise above the rest. Contained (but still very possible) social mobility is key to this system and directly benefits the elite- so long as those that rise do so with a career, rather than stocks, as they want these capable individuals to work--- not simply generate wealth like the elite do.\n\n\nEdit:\n\n\nI know I'm digging way too deep into a small comment made, sorry. Its just an issue I keep seeing, and people implying or directly making false claims on the issue allows for many people to simply dismiss more valid and precise claims, since they are related to these false claims.\n\n\nAdditionally, I enjoyed writing it haha. And like to think it is helping refine the presentation of my ideas everytime I go stupidly overboard like this",

They make more on the side.\n\nAccording to Open Secrets - Joe Manchin has made MILLIONS [on the side of that salary](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2021/10/joe-manchins-net-worth-spurs-questions-energy-policy-position/). \n\n> Manchin made between $591,950 and nearly $1.5 million in 2020 from\u00a0Enersystems, a coal brokerage company he founded in West Virginia.\u00a0Between 2011 and 2020, the West Virginia senator made between $4.9 million and $5.1 million from coal companies and in 2020 he had between $1.4 million and $5.8 million held in coal companies.\n\nThat's just from one source of income. \n\n> Manchin has also brought in tens of thousands of dollars in income from Farmington Resources, a mining company run by his son. Between 2011 and 2020, Manchin received between $80,000 and $250,000 from dividends and interest in the company.\n\nNot to mention the stock trading that elected officials take part in - which IMO *any* stock trading by elected officials is insider trading. It should be flat out illegal for them. \n\n[Joe Manchin's net worth](https://www.opensecrets.org/personal-finances/joe-manchin/net-worth?cid=N00032838&year=2018) is only 19th in the Senate - but sits at a hefty ***$7,623,534.***\n\nHow in the FUCK does someone who's been a senator for 11 years - making a salary of 174k per year - have a **net worth** of over 7.5 MILLION? 11 years of that salary doesn't even break 2 million - nevermind taxes and expenses. \n\n[His campaign fundraising surpasses his net worth as well.](https://www.opensecrets.org/members-of-congress/joe-manchin/summary?cid=N00032838&cycle=2020)\n\nStarting to see the fucking problem?",

They're too busy manipulating the whole thing to bring in more ad revenue and other revenue.\n\nI'm trying to think of a good analogy. One mediocre analogy is that people think people in restaurants or fast food remember them and spit in their food or whatever. Maybe it happens, but for 99.999% of the time - the employees don't care, and don't do things like spitting in food.\n\nOr like banks..... banks do manipuate things like the order of deposits and withdrawals to maximize NSF profits. But they don't look at peoples' accounts individually and manipulate things. They don't have time and don't care.\n\nDelivery drivers don't read \"FRAGILE\" on boxes because there's no rules about that. It's the responsibility of shippers to package stuff so it won't break. So yeah, drivers sometimes throw your shit, but those boxes get beat up way more than that in the rest of the shipping process you don't see. It's not ideal, but shippers know about this, so at this point, it's their responsibility to package stuff right. Putting \"FRAGILE\" on the box does nothing.\n\nIn the same way.... Google doesn't have time or care to manipulate things to make Republicans look bad. They're worried about maximizing profits. They do things to try and kill spam - not becuase they care about users, but because users will use other search engines if they don't.\n\nBasically, it boils down to \"Ain't nobody got time for that\". I wish I could think of some better analogies.\n\nAlso, even if some at Google wanted to do that, someone would blow the whistle on them because while it might be possible that more people at Google are liberal than conservative - and this I'm not even sure about - it's definitely not all liberal. You can't keep things like that private - the system is too huge and complicated. If Google was manipulating things to make Republicans look bad, people would blab.\n\nAnd we know how it all works on a broad level. The more websites that Google thinks are legit that have the same information, the more likely it is to appear higher in searches. It's how it all works.\n\nGoogle has no reason to manipulate searches in that way. We know that plenty of people post things that tend to cause Google to return those search results. It's just the way things are.",

If enough people agree that some term/search result needs to be found less relevant, then it's highly likely that the term is less relevant, and it's not just some individual or group who is pushing their agenda.  Think things like child sex abuse imagery and the n-word, things that are obviously objectionable to anyone with a brain.\n\n3. Also before you go on about \"but muh free speech\" and \"partisanship\", free speech is not unlimited and doesn't even apply to a private company's enforcement of ToS, and there's plenty of conservatives working for google who would end up balancing potential partisan changes out.

[Google has previously come under fire for tracking and saving users' location history even when all location services are turned off.](https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb) \"Not by default/It depends,\" may be technically true but it's also a very lawyerly answer that avoids the underlying issue. Reddit is more than happy to shit all over Google for this when the question isn't coming from a Republican congressman.\n\n2. Reddit also loves shitting on the fact that porn ads show up in children's games. Those ads are displayed through Google's ad services. The app may be on an iPhone, but Pichai could absolutely hazard a guess as to what's going on there and offer constructive insight into the underlying issue. He's not going to do that though because he's testifying before Congress and he doesn't want to get himself into trouble. \n\n3. While the \"Google is intentionally censoring conservatives!\" narrative is specious and politically motivated, the underlying arguments here aren't as farfetched as they're made out to be. A programmer or project manager's biases can absolutely affect what metrics are weighed and what algorithms are used when deciding what results are \"relevant\". Lamar Smith asking if Google's algorithm might be politically biased isn't any more ludicrous than [Elizabeth Warren asking if Apple's credit card algorithm is sexist](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/14/warren-rips-goldman-over-its-apple-card-discriminatory-algorithms.html) or [*Science* publishing a study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342) on racial biases in the algorithms that manage healthcare decisions.\n\nThere's certainly political theatrics going on and some of these questions are poorly worded coming from lawyers who should probably know better (though that's likely influenced by the former) but the basis for their lines of questioning are far, far more relevant that the silly background track and comments here would give credit.",

Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.[5]\n\nReferring to the \u201cman behind the curtain\u201d reminds boomers of a specific pop culture artifact. It creates an in-group (people who get it) and an out-group (people who don\u2019t), and referencing it is a kind of ritual of recognition.",

You may get *ads* (even in search results) that fit your profile, but even that is an automated data point process similar to how search itself works. \n\nOrganic results may be effected by things like location, because you dont want to look for restaurants in another country. This basic information can control things like that to make searches relevant, so switching to incognito or a new device or anything that has an incomplete or different picture will yield slightly different results. \n\nThe main point is - no person or group is doing this. This is how automated relevant searching works. Without those core features, it would be completely useless. \n\nAnd even with those features, they're not being used to change search results in order to fit some agenda. The fear of that is nothing more than peoples ignorance towards how it works coupled in with a refusal to accept that people may not like them.",

In the private sector there is a huge ageism trend where companies simply don't want older workers because it's widely believed (I say believe here but I don't think most of us would disagree) that people have significant decline in cognitive ability over time. \n\nSo 65+ is way too old to be considered for most jobs that require a sharp mind and a current understanding of the world around us... unless you're an elected official shaping the course of an entire country and potentially the world.\n\nMy parents and in-laws are the same age as most of congress and their minds are incredibly dull and they are easily confused by even simple concepts. \n\nFor example... *both* my parents and my in-laws were totally shocked that they could watch their Netflix accounts at my house. \n\nI share my Netflix account with them. Every single time they start the app it shows my name, their name, etc. Every. Single. Time. Did they not wonder why my name was \"on\" their TV every time? Did they not inherently understand that I must also see their name on *my* TV? If clicking on \"Steve\" loaded their account did they not understand that clicking on \"Bob\" would load another account? What the fuck did they think all those icons with names were for? Yet there we were with 4 adults marveling that they could watch their own Netflix picks at my house. \n\nBy itself that's not a big deal but it's like god damn... if four people cannot understand something so basic that it just requires reading a name you know and thinking \"Oh, we're sharing this\" after the person has *explicitly told you* that they're sharing something with you... you probably shouldn't be making important decisions for anyone.",

Sometimes.\" Or \"The phone is fully capable of that. However certain features must be manually activated.\n\nBoomberman is phrasing his question about the phone in his hand when he clearly means \"any model like this or similar\" and is waving his phone as an example phone. Googleman is purposefuly phrasing his response to latch on to that phrasing and say he can't provide information about the phone in Boombermans hand. \n\nThe bottom line is these phones are capable of doing what Boomberman is concerned about them doing and Googleman is just beating around the bush about admitting to that. Between a yes and a no its not some complicated in the middle truth. Its a yes with some reassurances, but a yes nonetheless. \n\nTldr; every phone of certain models has a functional GPS unit inside of it. Whether it is ever used or not, it exists.",

EVERY phone of certain models comes standard with GPS hardware. You just turn it on.\n\nIf you held a GPS unit up in front of me, powered off, and asked me if it could track my movements and my answer was \"not while it's turned off it cant\" you would think that was a pretty obtuse answer.\n\nIs his phone currently enabled to trackhis movement within the building? Who knows. Whishy washy answer. Is that phone capable of tracking his movement within the building? Unambiguously the answer is Yes.\n\nBoomberman and Gooleman arent friends. I already addressed that. The set up is adversarial when in reality both parties are actually at least kind of interested in the security of a great number of people and could/should be working together on that.

If you opted out of tracking services whenever prompted (such as when setting up your device, installing a new app, installing a new update, etc.) then the only way your device could be tracked is by using cellular data analasys software to track the most recently accessed cell tower or wireless point.\n\nGranted its far too easy to accidentally activate one or more of any number of GPS tracking services these days, and I believe it should be more transparent when an app or company is attempting to gain access to these services, but my point stands that it is, has been and always will be a choice to have your device tracked.

If you don't work in tech a lot of shit flies over your head. For example \"algorithm\" is now a meaningless buzz word. you'll notice that Pitchai never uses the word algorithm. Google search is a platform that is made up of a framework of different systems and processes. Using the word algorithm makes it seem like it's a simple math function or some shit that people can easily inject shit into.\n\nJust read some of the comments in this post basically agreeing that political bias can be inserted into the search results by people. More than a handful don't understand what a behemoth the Google search platform is. I work at a small company and any one change takes a lot of work to affect the final software product.\n\nAlso, for all you people crying political bias. You seem to be under the impression that software engineers in silicon valley are all left leaning. I assure you that is not the case. There's more than enough tech bros who are either centrists or some kind of dumbass libertarian (yes I consider anyone who's libertarian a dumbass, my personal opinion)",

People have no idea how thoroughly they are surveilled by default and even more, no idea what that means. It\u2019s absolutely about proximity and the formation of graphs of association.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason Google is being sued by its own employees for violating its famous do no evil clause.\n\nThe extent of surveillance is unbelievable.\n\nResearch why Amazon order updates no longer tell you what order they\u2019re even talking about.

Google has a method in the Android operating system to track a person's location.  But only if you allow it to.  And furthermore you may choose which applications are allowed to use this tech, Geolocation. \n\nMy question was supposed to be the example of the nuanced position of answering a question which doesn't have a binary answer given the situations constraints.\n\nTo mistakenly answer a question wrong is not to lie.  It's simply a mistake.\n\nA person who thinks that mistakenly answering a question is lying, is someone who doesn't understand the base defenition of lying. \n\nNot unlike someone who doesn't understand that the answer to \"is Google tracking me?\" is \"only if you allow it.",

Yes, they track what city you are in. They track that you went to Taco Bell and Target.\n\nBut they are not recording the coordinates of every location you go at these locations.

It frames the question. Its purpose is to make the question understood and more relatable by the people in the room. \n\n>does Google track my movement? \n\nThis is the question. \n\n>The answer to that is not a simple yes or no answer.\n\nThe answer is a simple yes or no answer - yes. In every scenario, apart from an insignificant few where the user has the ability *and* the desire to cripple their smart capabilities by disabling *multiple* settings, google tracks the user's movement. Yet even in those rare circumstances where they don't do it actively, they still *can* track the users movements, at the request of lettered agencies, at will and without the consent of the user, regardless of any setting the user has disabled. \n\nYour claim that it is not a simple yes or no answer is equivalent to answering the question \"Does a bear shit in the woods?\" the same way. \n\nDo bears shit in the woods? \n\nYes. Apart from the few bears that shit in a meadow or by a riverbank but bears do indeed shit in the woods. Exceptions do not disprove rules, something a software engineer of your claimed experience should be very familiar with. \nYour lack of attention to detail would certainly make me question your role on my team.\n\nThe answer is still the same: Yes. Which is why \"Do bears shit in the woods\" is a common hyperbolic statement in answer to a question where the answer is obviously yes. \n\n>Google has shady data collection practices, but you are not helping the situation when you misrepresent it.\n\nI'm not misrepresenting it whatsoever. Google tracks your movements without your consent through default features hidden away. These features *can* be disabled if you are knowledgeable but at the cost of critical **smart** features of your **smart phone**. And even then, while you disable google's ability to collect your location data as a matter of procedure, you **cannot** prevent google from tracking your location if they choose to. \n\n>FWIW, I agree with the article you posted and don't disagree with you on the fact they do track you regardless of whether you have opted-in or out. But it's the details here is where you lose me.\n\n....... So you agree with me on everything I've said but you want to disagree with me anyway. That's the first thing you've said that actually makes me believe you're a software engineer, lol\n\n>Google isn't going to waste millions or billions of dollars on storage for useless data. That's just bad design. Any competent engineer will optimize wherever they can and only collect/store what makes sense.\n\nWhich for a company like google is location data at every opportunity, as they do by default, because storing two decimal values totalling 32 bytes is cheap and easy.",

And you will never move past a dev 1 with your attitude.\n\nAgain, you have problems and need help.\n\nYou lost the argument right at the start with an attack and that's why I'm showing you no respect. I have over a decade of experience with large distributed systems and migrating to the cloud. But by starting out how you did, you only made yourself look like a fool by attacking someone you know nothing about. So you shouldn't be surprised when others do it in return.\n\nSo you can continue to be a smug know-it-all, but don't expect to get anywhere in life. Meanwhile I have worked up through dev 1-4 and am now a senior in a leadership position consulting with all the teams in my org. And I'm only in my 30s.\n\nIt's clear to me that you are nowhere close to being on the same level as me. That's why you can't see beyond generic mass data collection as opposed to much less granular, but more useful data collection.\n\nLet's no forget the question that started this whole discussion. Does Google track every movement? The answer is technically no, but it's much more nuanced than that. Someday you'll learn that nothing is ever so clearcut.",

Most people like being able to use a map feature while they drive. They like getting food recommendations based on what's near by. But that wasn't the question. He asked does google know if I moved?

If you don't want Google to know that, you can turn that stuff off\". That would answer his question without saying \"I don't know\", which he seems to seize onto.\n\nFor the \"why does a picture of Trump appear under the results for the word 'idiot'?\" question, he has this big piece about the \"over 200 signals\" and whatever, but really that just makes it harder to follow. It'd be much simpler to say \"we look at billions of webpages and measure which things commonly appear alongside your search terms, and use that to determine what is relevant to your search\", and if he doesn't mind giving the specifics and risking the laughs, he could go on to say \"if a picture of Trump appears for the search term 'idiot', it's because the word 'idiot' is frequently being used by people all over the internet alongside pictures and/or text about Donald Trump\".\n\nThe rest, however, are just idiotic questions and/or questioners.",

There's a certain knack to framing an answer in a way that doesn't sound like an \"I don't know\", and in a way that cuts through attempts to interrupt or misrepresent it. If you're talking to politically-motivated folks whose agenda would be served by twisting your answers to their narrative, that knack is a required defence mechanism.\n\n> These aren\u2019t laymen though. They\u2019re literally tasked with writing the laws that will shape The internet. \n\nThey *are* laymen. They shouldn't be, but they are. And at any rate,  there's a point of diminishing returns where increased technical knowledge takes a lot of effort to achieve and doesn't help you legislate better, at which point you need to call in an expert, have them explain the big picture, and ask them for guidance... which is basically what they're doing here, it's just that the point where it's happening - the point where they reach the edge of their understanding - is happening way too early. What we're seeing here - the point where they don't understand and start asking questions - is always going to happen; it's just that in this instance it happens at a point when the average member of the public is still able to understand the concepts being discussed, so we can see how out of their depth they are.\n\nExplaining the broad concept to someone who lacks the grounding in the subject required to understand it in detail is a valuable skill to have. Sometimes you're explaining how the TV works so that your nan can find her shows, sometimes you're explaining a project to your boss so that they can make strategic decisions, and sometimes you're advising Congress. The skills used are the same, and worth cultivating in any professional.",

In a court, lawyers also ask seemingly dumb questions to not only make a point, but also to sway a jury. In this case the intended jury is not just the people sitting there, but also those watching at home. None of these seemed that unreasonable, for example, the location tracking question was a simplified question that the respondent handled well, but every reasonable person understood what he was asking. Also, the answer was almost certainly yes, since it's come out time and time again they are always violating your privacy regardless of what settings you have enabled. The Trump question had an obvious answer to most of us, but not to an older generation that doesn't understand how searches work. Also the last question about whether a person/people can manipulate the searches is also yes. He tried to play it as if some algorithm is working entirely independently behind the scenes, but they can and do manipulate it all the time. \n\nTLDR Anyone like OP who blindly believed this guy is probably more ignorant of how Google and all the big telecom/ISPs/internet companies in general work than these congress members.",

He was being a boomer about it, but he was really asking a pretty simple question: Does Google have access to my location data, and is it precise enough to see which part of this room I'm sitting in? Honestly, I think that's a reasonable question, and it seemed like Pichai dodged the question by gatekeeping it behind questions that he figured the congressman couldn't answer.\n\nPersonally, I found out that Google was keeping a record of everywhere I go a while back. Like, I looked up directions to Costco and it said \"You've been here 2 years ago.\" I clicked on a couple things and found out that they knew the exact date I had been there, and could even show me the route I took to get there. I wasn't driving that day, so I didn't look up the store on Google maps or anything. It knew I was there just because I had my device on me when I went there. It created a record of that, which must be on Google's cloud, because I still have access to it years later after getting a new phone.\n\nThis is not something I opted in to, nor is it something that they informed me was happening. Maybe \"opting in\" is just when you hit \"Allow\" on one of the permission requests that your phone makes, but it's not at all clear that you're specifically opting into this. So when I hear a congressmen ask him point blank if Google knows those things about him, and Pichai says \"not by default, you have to opt in,\" to me that's an obvious lie. I think Pichai did a good job of dodging the question by making the congressman look dumb, but to me Pichai ends up looking like a slimeball.",

King didn't realize the CEO of Google wouldn't be able to answer a question about an iPhone.

He uses those interruptions to cast the witness as either uncooperative or incompetent (\"you make $100M, you should know\", \"it's a yes or no\", \"I'm shocked you don't know\"), and to lead the interrogation toward his preferred conclusion by the nose (\"I think Google obviously does\") when the witness's testimony would contradict that conclusion if only he were allowed to complete a sentence.\n\nFwiw I only watched the first guy. And yeah he could just be your classic angry grandpa, befuddled to the point of rage because technology has advanced through the years and his understanding has not -- but I do think that even if that's partly true they also probably understand more than they're letting on, and they're playing a bit dumb in order to lead the interrogation to the desired outcome rather than to the truth.",

It's the same problem with describing changing the input on the TV to your grandparents. It goes in one ear, and out the other, or the words mean nothing to them.\n\nTerms like \"framework\", \"algorithm\", \"crawling\" makes little, if any sense at all to people like this. They don't study these terms, so things like this need to be broken down. However, that doesn't work when they give you 15 seconds to tell them what would easily fill a 30 minute lecture, with a presentation.\n\nThis is the separation of technology and the \"general public\", public being the user. These people barely know how to text/call their adult child than understanding how AdSense works, or understanding that it's not a human person building search results for users all day.\n\nPichai here is a businessman and CEO. He literally works at the head of one of the largest tech companies in the world, and only needs to simplify his explanations to investors, which even that might be done by other teams. He is so heavily invested in tech jargon that terms like the ones I listed above are common language.\n\nI'm guilty of the same thing, where I'm trying to explain to a user why I can't add the specific feature they want to the site, why something's broken, why I need to change the RAM in their system, how to re-enable their audio drivers, etc. I can't even begin to imagine how frustrated he must feel trying to deal with so many idiots barking questions at him, while trying to answer them all, while many are dramatically different from the last.\n\nIn the end, I figure they're doing this on purpose, understanding the answers or not. They're likely trying to get him to mess up and answer something wrong, or see if he's hiding something, and they're trying to confuse and discombobulate him into getting what they want, which is likely some form of government control over the system, some monitoring system, more taxes, etc.",

The issue on display in this video is a \"politician\" thing. These politicians haven't learned anything new in decades. People in the private sector tend to continue learning throughout their entire lives. It's not the same with politicians. It's my perception that many politicians coast into old age and into the twilight of their political career on the knowledge of their youth. To them, the internet is a complete mystery. Computers are either magic or they invent some sort of parable in their minds to explain their inner workings. They envision gears and levers because that's where their learning stopped. It's sad and scary that our leaders are so arrogant and ignorant.",

This evening on my local news they showed video of Police fighting back against homeless in a huge local park.  The reporter actually was berating the police for \"unacceptable and unprovoked violence.\"  The video did not show the dozen or so police taken to local hospitals after having been attacked by these same homeless prior to the section of video shown.

Knowing how the system works in full would allow one to exploit that and knowing exactly what would give you the #1 spot in search results for a given search phrase would be of near infinite value. \n\nWhy these senators and such don\u2019t have an IT advisor to translate the questions they are asking is just beyond my comprehension.",
