Unfortunately for me, I was in my older truck which does not have a dash cam\n\nI sent the ticket in not guilty already but I know I'm going to end up having to pay it. FML.\n\n TL;DR: Told a cop he was blocking the crosswalk, got a ticket for $200 and driving the wrong car.\n\nEdit: Since I keep getting people saying \"go to court.\"  I did plead not guilty and plan on going to court.",

My wife is a cop and I can't count how many times she has given away her lunch to homeless people or exhibited other acts of kindness and generosity. \n\nHer goal is to help people and to do what she can to keep us safe. She's also a paramedic. \n\nWhen we judge any other group by the actions of the small percentage who behave badly it's considered prejudicial and unacceptable. In the U.S. we seem to think it's fine to do this with cops. Most of them put their lives on the line for us ever day. I worry far less about her getting shot then I do her getting run over while she's writing a ticket or arresting somebody for a DUI. \n\nBoth her jobs are incredibly frustrating, and much of her time is spent servicing the 2% of the population who consume 90% of the first responder resources.",

The meme was \"Money machine goes brrrr\". The sound of a lot of money being printed rapidly.\n\nThe meme then evolved to \"X machine goes brrrr\" when a machine did something silly on unexpected, usually on repeat or a high rate.\n\nNow the meme has evolved to just become \"X goes brrrr\". Sometimes it is something on repeat or a high rate, but sometimes it now just means fail. The implication here is that the cop has started a chain of events in a long system that will eventually show the cop made a big error and the defendant will get a payout (despite that being unlikely due to corruption and the courts favouring cops).\n\nI hope you enjoyed the history of meme culture. I feel like I should become the David Attenborough of memes now.\n\nEdit: Some redditors have pointed out the connection of his meme to the sound of gunfire. My personal belief is gunfire is not the origin, but instead a possible mental trigger (excuse the pun) for the money machine meme first being used. As the image of a money machine rapidly spitting out money is very similar to the imagery of rapid gunfire. However, the meme first began with the money machine, not \"A-10 goes brrrr\" or more likley, \"A-10 goes brrrrt\". Instead, rapid gunfire was probably just the catalyst in the meme-daddy's mind (or meme-mummy) for the money machine meme. But, likely we will never truly know because the internet is such a wonderful and weird place. Also, thanks for the silver!",

I remember trying to have him listen to The Great Malenko (because I thought ICP was hilarious as an idiotic child), and it scared him enough that he asked me to turn it off and refused to listen to it. Like literally the music frightened him. Same thing happened with Will Smith's Nightmare On My Street. Dude was on the verge of crying over music that's supposed to be funny because the beat was creepy...\n \n Sure enough, after he grew up, the coward became a cop so he could feel like a big strong man.

I was in handcuffs at the time for being drunk in public and was fully cooperating and knew resistance is futile. Anyways... to make a long story short my head dented his car and he immediately goes \"well that's going to cost at least $1501 to fix... you know what that means. *starts laughing. Felony Second degree criminal mischief.\"\n\nThat kicked off the worst 3 years of my life. Because I guess that cop just felt like doing it.\n\nHappened in front of a business with ample CCTV. I called the next day to try to get video of the incident to prove that cop was just having a bad day. Manager of the facility was like \"ummmm.... yeah... about that.  The cops came back this morning and made me give them all the files and made me delete everything saying that it was part of an investigation. \"\nEnded up having to do 1,000 hours of community service.  Was on probation for 2 years. 15 years later with a completely clean record ever since I can't get any type of secret clearance which is important in my field for moving into higher paying governmental jobs.\n\nLesson of this story is NEVER interact with them NEVER put yourself in a position where you are their target. Because they can and will ruin your life and will go home and sleep like a baby never thinking about you ever again. \n\nTL;DR Cop was having a bad day.  Ruined my life for a couple of years. Still have lasting consequences 15 years later to my life for something I had no control over happening.",

You do a mini academy that includes a baton class hitting a cop in a padded outfit for a scenario.  We were told to shout stop resisting while doing it.\n\nThere were 3 reasons for it.\n\nThe first and least important was in case you were being recorded they'd know the person was still resisting.\n\nThe second was telling the person to stop resisting as you want them to stop resisting.\n\nThe last was that in a fight people often forget to breath and end up wearing themselves out. Yelling that forces you to breathe.\n\nIm not saying no cop does it to someone not resisting to look good on camera but I think the latter two play a bigger part in it being standard training.",

Imagine spending 20 years in prison because a corrupt officer planted heroin on you.\n- No knock warrants mean that you\u2019re never safe in your own residence. Warrants in general are just rubber stamps by judges in many jurisdictions.\n- Asset forfeiture means that police can seize your property, money, and vehicle on a whim.",

Imagine spending 20 years in prison because a corrupt officer planted heroin on you.\n\nA friend of mine got arrested at 18 for selling a gram of pot to an informant. His moms apt got broken into by the cops. Door literally off one hinge. He just immediately gave them the pot cause he didn't want them trashing his moms place anymore. It was in a little safe and they took the money out of his wallet. Like just normal petty cash amounting to under $40 over 10 years ago. Well, they took that money and placed it in the safe with the drugs and took pictures. They also tried to charge him with guns charges for having a muzzle lock rifle in a rifle case in the back of his closet.",

The woman that had previously accused him of sexual assault called in to 911 to report Blake had stolen her keys. When police arrived to the scene, there was a fight between him and the officers, but there's conflicting reporting on who initiated the physical behavior. That being said, it escalated into him being tasered twice and shaking it off, and then trying to enter the driver's seat of a car with kids in the back while being armed with a knife. Blake himself admitted to being armed with a knife as well. While they ended up being Blakes kids, in the moment all officers knew was this:\n\n911 was called, this man reportedly stole keys and has a sexual assault warrant out for his arrest and is now entering a car with children inside while not cooperating with the investigation and being armed with a knife. \n\nIf the police had just let him go and it turned our to be that lady's kids, and he kidnapped and sexually assaulted and/or killed them, or crashed the car killing the kids while trying to escape, everyone would be upset asking why police didn't stop him before he got in the car.",

You don't have to directly say something to not agree with it. It's a common tactic people like you use. \" Where did I SPECIFICALLY say that \", as if that really matters. If you don't want to be associated with agreeing with idiots, don't engage with them I guess. What you said was like telling us the Sky is blue. You selected a category topic based on what the discussion was about, which in this case was about how \" cops do X in order to break the law and hurt/kill people \". You could have easily told everyone to not go to school because white people are mass murderers and like to shoot up schools. Or a story about how there is video of a school getting shot up by a white kid because he was mad at his mom. When you categorize an entire group of something, then that's you saying ALL of them are X.",

The cameras aren't pointed to the sides of the squad car, and that's how the cars were situated; side-by-side.\n\nThat was the point of the cop saying what he said: he was \"establishing\" that OP had a phone, knowing there wouldn't be footage to contradict it.\n\nIf you go to court to fight a ticket and your argument is, \"The cop is lying,\" you're not going to win your case. The facts might support OP, but OP has no way to prove them. It's his word against the cops.\n\nHe's not going to win.\n\nAt best, he'll be able to plea to a different charge that doesn't impact his license. He's still pay a fine, though.",

Which was important because he claimed to be ahead of the speed limit sign and he was sitting way beyond it. \n\nSo we asked for all the footage. The amount of hoops we had to jump through was ridiculous. We had to put in a request to the police department. That turned into making a request to the court and prosecutor. Who told us to contact the records department of the county. We ended up getting footage 2 weeks before court. It took over 6 months for court due to covid. \n\nMy wife and I both have a history in corrections so being in court and around cops, judges and lawyers isn't that big of a deal. She was respectful and even joked around with them in court. \n\nI printed out all sorts of evidence. Comparing where he said they were based on dashcam and body cam video. The cop was there but didn't seem to care about having to be there, didn't maliciously lie to make it seem like she was wrong..but the prosecutor was an absolute fucking brick of a dick. \n\nIn court that's who's going to screw you. Especially if you can't argue articulately against him. She ended up getting things lowered because she admitted to going a little over but nowhere near what he said. I told her not to admit to anything but she felt like she would have ended up paying for the whole thing otherwise.",

I'd guesstimate 2.8PB (15 years of storage) closer to $600K.\n\nEven if we split the cost difference, we're talking $1M for 15 years. Don't think that's even necessary so call it $400k for 5 years of storage.\n\n\nYeah, there's no fucking reason not to do this. Besides not wanting to incriminate themselves.",

I think over time we don't have a good grasp on how fast storage gets bigger, especially relative to how slowly things like video resolution change etc.\n\nIdk, tape is probably more expensive at this point. You could buy a NAS and just swap out drives. You can archive them just as easily as tapes and HDD \"shelf life\" is comparable, and iirc, better than tapes anyway. Many videographers and such will just keep an \"exposed\" external drive bay and just hit swap drives. If youre talking 8TB drives, each one's ~250 hours of storage. So you could pretty easily just swap a drive out once a day, cover a full 24 hours of ten cams of footage, and just stick it in a back room. They're swappable enough that you literally just slide it out and slide a new one in, so you could have literally any lay person do shit like this. It's really not hard at all. And a single 8 TB drive is like $150.",

You don't even want to know what some hillbilly cops might do to you. And who's gonna believe you? Back in the day there wasn't much of a culture where victims were believed. They automatically assumed that you did something to deserve it.\n\nSometimes it feels like the cops are fighting us out of petty spite for all the freedom they no longer have to act like gods.",

Half of our voting block wants to overthrow the government.\n\nPolice in this country are essentially paramilitary death squads. Some states are trying to literally legalize violent right-wing militias to act under the purview of the governor to do what the police can't.\n\nOf course we're fucking afraid.",

Anyway i leave my house, headed down the road, about 2 mile from my house i see a car RIGHT up my butt, couldn't even see the headlights. Tapped the brakes, a little back off asshole, and he gets closer, so I all but slammed them on, my car was like 25yrs old, i didnt care. Well, turned out this was a cop, he was tailing me so close i had never seen his lightbar. Luckily he did avoid hitting me, but instantly pulled me over. He comes over:\n\nCop- what the hell was that?\n\nMe- hmmm? I was looking for my turn, sry i broke a little hard, its my gfs car im not used to driving it. I didnt realize you were so close behind me i couldn't even see your headlights.\n\nC- Broke hard? YOU CUT ME OFF BACK THERE!\n\nM- Where? I pulled out of my house over a mile ago, nobody else was near me, i haven't turned since.\n\nCop just looks angry, walked but to his car, came back with no ticket and actually told me to get the f out of here. \n\nM-Excuse me?\n\nC-You heard me. Hopefully you'll get T-boned next time.\n\nM- Thank you, sir. Have a great night, Protect and Serve!\n\nFound out later, relaying what happened to gf and her mother, her mom suddenly says omg i f'ing hate that guy! He came in right after bitching about you(me). Gf's mom worked overnight at the local dunkin donuts, and knew all the cops. Turned out the reason i didn't get a ticket was bc where i supposedly cut him off was in Oxford, he pulled me over just over the seymour line and he was a seymour cop. It was the end of a bad day, and i guess dealing with me was the cherry on top. She was laughing so hard, i guess he was really mad, and she got along great with all the officers she really hated this particular one.",

The part that makes it the worst is that the \"good cops\" won't do shit about it. The \"we protect our own\" mindset makes them all part of the problem. That's just the cop version of \"snitches get stitches\" that they hate gangs using. \n\nSame problem with the catholic church.  If they were booting out and arresting the child molesters, it would've been a normal bad problem.  The fact that the whole organization covers it up and moves those priests from church to church is what makes it the problem it is. \n\nAny time people try to defend this stuff with \"there's always a few bad apples\", I try to remind them that's not the whole saying.  It's \"a few bad apples spoil the bunch.\" You pick out the bad ones from the start,  or they're all gonna be bad.  We clearly know which option they choose to go with.",

It is: \"an **unfair** feeling of dislike for a person or group because of race, sex, religion, etc.\" or \"a feeling of like or dislike for someone or something **especially when it is not reasonable or logical**\" ([https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prejudice](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prejudice))\n\nNotice how both definitions make exceptions when a dislike is *justified*. Since cops steal more than burglars do in a given year and murder more than a thousand American citizens annually, then those worthless murderous thieving gutter trash deserve their image. Disliking public servants who are paid to murder their own in cold blood is justified.\n\nIt's frankly sad that you're too blind to see that very basic fact. I don't know if you're a cop, or your brother is or something, but cops are scum. Pick a new job if you don't like it. They chose this image for themselves. They chose to be the shit nuggets stuck to the ass hairs of society, and they chose to scream like babies and double down when others pointed out their behaviors were shitty.\n\nlol",

I will not pretend to understand what you have to put up with, but the safety of the public is repeatedly put at risk in the name of officer job security. \n\nEvery time police refuse to hold one other to their own standards, they are actively enabling violence against the community and contributing to public mistrust. \n\nAt the end of the day no matter what you have personally done or been through, all the badges look the same to the rest of us. We have no way of knowing whether an officer is a decent person working for their community or has prior write ups for use of force. \n\nIf you cared as much about holding others to the same standard as you say you do and had a modicum of public awareness, then you should be easily able to understand why people say ACAB. You should be foaming at the mouth to fix the institution you work within or at the very least see how absolutely broken some of them are.",

Sure, you don't have to obey unlawful orders, but if they believe their orders are lawful they are going to force you. And unless you are an attorney and well-versed matters of civil law, good luck determining on the fly if those orders are lawful.\n\nA good example is a traffic stop where they get out and want to search your car, but you have locked the doors. If you tell them that they can't search it, they can and often will say something like, \"Well, I'm going to search the car. If you don't let me I'm going to break the window and gain access to search the car.\"\n\nAt that point you can verbally express that they are threatening to damage your property and forcing you to open the car, but you don't agree and are not complying with the search. You are only preventing your property from being damaged.\n\nThe bottom line is that you really can't decide, on the fly, the legality of their demands. If you directly resist, at a certain point, you are giving license to whip your ass. - that's hyperbole, you are giving license to force compliance.",

I do recall reading about a SCOTUS ruling that allowed police to pat you down for weapons during an interaction for their own safety, but <either in some states or nation-wide, I do not know> they couldn't search your pockets and such.\n\nI do know that as far as the law goes, it's your person, your car, your home in the order of least protected to most protected. Laws get very, very strict when it comes to police entering or searching your home/property.\n\nOnce again though, that is best proved in court. There HAVE been cases where police have been killed or injured because they were illegally entering and protecting property. But I sure wouldn't want the burden to prove that I was justified to be on me. If they enter illegally, they have to prove it was justified.\n\nMy state has a law on the books that specifically addresses this. It reads along the lines of: Any amount of force, up to and including deadly force may be used on peace officers acting illegally in the protection of one's person/property or to prevent the commission of a felony.\n\nBut you had better be damn sure you are justified, because if you aren't you are looking at like 10 years right off the bat, and that's just for hitting a cop.\n\nIn the same vein, if you are defending your property and the cop kills you, even if they aren't legally justified in entering the property, as long as they BELIEVE at the time that they were justified, they have qualified immunity and can't be charged for the shooting. I'm not even sure if they could be charged for violating your civil rights in the first place due to you being dead. Perhaps an actual lawyer will chime in on that one.\n\nBut that's just why I just assert my rights, clam up, and hope for the best. And maintain a calm and cool demeanor as best I can so that I don't escalate the situation. Shit's real. Those folks are largely under-trained, and a LOT of them just want to do what they need to do and make it home safe. Not to mention that they have had way too much dumped on their plates. We can't expect them to have perfect trigger discipline AND be experts in mental health, societal issues, lawyers, etc. That's a separate issue though.\n\nBelieve it or not, I actually don't hate cops. They are just adversaries when it comes to legal matters.",

                              "text": "My parents divorced when I was very young. My father worked at a take-out restaurant that was owned by a friend of the family who was at the hospital when I was born. It was burglarized. They put up a couple game cameras and some fencing to harden the security.\n\nIt was burglarized again, and the following Monday the police asked my mother to bring me in for some voluntary questioning because I'd been there about eight hours before the burglary and they hoped I could tell them what I had seen in case the burglar had come in to case the joint in preparation for the burglary later that night.\n\nI was sent into a room with a detective who spent about 45 minutes just talking to me about life. How I'd grown up. What I studied in school. What I wanted to do after I graduated. What video games do I play? Oh, I have a son who plays that one.\n\nEventually, I said something that the detective latched onto in order to increase the pressure in the conversation. My responses grew shorter and colder for a while until he asked why and I said, \"Honestly I'm feeling kind of defensive right now. You asked me in here as a potential witness. We've been talking for half an hour and you haven't asked me a single question about what I saw. Personally, I don't think I saw anything that matters. I came in because I thought you have the rest of the evidence and maybe something that seemed insignificant at the time would fit into the bigger picture that I don't have, but this doesn't feel very collaborative. It feels like an elicitation. Right now, less concerned with helping your investigation and more concerned with making sure I don't get arrested for a crime I did not commit.\"\n\nThis was, as they would describe, a clear sign of a guilty conscience.\n\nAt that point he switched gears to my relationship with my father, explaining how he had never known his father either and he knew how desperate I must be for his approval, but I needed to understand that my father was a bad man who had been lying to me. As an example, they told me they had evidence against me and they had shown him. He'd had the opportunity to tell me, but he didn't. Would a loving father really let his son go into a police interview so unprepared? It was a blatant lie that misrepresented countless facts of the situation and I made the mistake of calling out every single one. Basically, I'd known my father my whole life and I could prove their alleged conversation with my father had never taken place. It didn't cost me anything, because I was right and I knew exactly where to locate proof I was right, but I realize now that if I had misspoken it could have cost me dearly.\n\nNot making any progress, he walked back and said, \"All I'm saying is you need to recognize that you're seventeen now and you need to recognize that this isn't a game. Actions have consequences.\"\n\nAt that point, a second detective came in and tried to hand me a document, which I declined so he put it on the table in front of me with a pen. As he was telling me, \"This just certifies you'll tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so that we can formally begin our interview,\" I was reading the document. It was a Miranda warning and a waiver of my Miranda rights.\n\nMy basic thought was, \"Oh, this is a 'Miranda Rights' type of situation. I should use those.\" I said, \"If you're asking me to waive my rights then I'm not going to answer your questions.\"\n\n\"Fine. We wanted to do this cleanly. Give you a chance to man up, 'fess up. We could've gone easy on you, but you just wouldn't cooperate. We'll make sure you do hard time for this.\"\n\nAs they were saying this, they chased me out the door by basically power walking straight at me such that they couldn't stop and I could either go towards the exit or let them run into me. Without thinking, I instinctively did the former. I pushed the request to exit button with my sleeve, depriving them of the finger print sample they had hoped to collect. They would later present the camera footage of that to my lawyer, who was representing me *pro bono*, telling her that it was, \"clearly the work of an experienced criminal, not a man who needs or deserves your help.\"\n\nAnd that's how I learned that you always deal with the police through an attorney, even as the victim or the family of the victim.",

As in, it is better bet to assume the police are up to no good.\n\nAnd it is for this reason I have, and will continue to do so, suggest that everyone get dash cameras for their vehicles, and make sure you know how to operate the camera on your cellphone, for cases the dash cam can't cover.\n\nThe police and courts are not going to protect you from the police.  For that you are on your own.",

Any problem officers are dealt with pretty quickly or it eventually catches up to them if they\u2019re able to avoid getting in trouble. Most of what I\u2019ve seen first-hand was at my first department that was a smaller city PD. The standards were/are very low. Basically just pass a PT test once at the beginning of your career, have a valid DL, high school diploma, and no criminal history. That is just asking for trouble IMO. Compare that with where I am now: we have to have a degree, or a combo of college hrs and military service, they do thorough background checks (they find your teachers from grade school, neighbors, former bosses, etc for additional info), polygraph, psych eval, and even a check on your credit. You\u2019re in training for a full year and probation for another. If we could raise the standard across all agencies and departments, we\u2019d have far fewer issues across the board. Of course it won\u2019t be perfect and doesn\u2019t fix everything, but it would sure as hell would be better.",

Asked me where I was coming from, cause someone reported mischief in the cemetery. \n\nI explained I had just purchased a tea across the road and was headed up to the lights for work.\n\n\"That store isn't open at night. So, I'm gonna ask you again. What are you up to ma'am?\"\n\nRepeated myself with the same response.\n\nI was frustrated I was going to be late, so I (less courteously) told him I could show he could feel the cup of tea to see that it's still warm, and I could show him my badge to prove I worked there. Even offered to give him the number to verify... and explain to my boss why I was late.\n\nHe didn't appreciate the sass.\n\nTicket #1 - Harassment of a law enforcement officer $245\n\nTicket #2 - Criminal mischief under $5000\n$870\n\nAnd I got written up for being late to work.

I walked over to them and I got an official report the officer got the confession from the person who drove back to the scene and an apology from her. Her insurance paid to have the bumper and headlight replaced. We had footage as well too. Well down the road I had to add my boyfriend to my insurance for my vehicle because we keep separate insurance. The rate was higher than it should have been because he had an accident on his record. When we did some digging they referenced this one. We were both pissed , we had a police report with a confession from the at fault driver. He was literally sitting at home when all of this happened. Nobody was driving the car when it was hit it was sitting in a parking lot. I was a covered driver on the policy as well at the time. So yeah fuck insurance companies greedy fucks will find any reason to charge you.",

At that point the rest of the people waiting groan because the proceedings come to a screeching halt.

That's to prevent fraudulent tickets and mistakes like someone holding their wallet, some card, make-up box. Things that might look like a phone. \n\nBasically the cops have to prove you actually used your phone and not the other way around, if it was in your pocket they can't describe the brand, model and color so there's no way you have to pay the fine.",

I obviously went to court to fight it but I had to take a half day off of work which is about $300 profit to fight an $80 ticket. It's so shitty that it wasn't even worth my time and it would've been easier and less time consuming to just pay it. I'm convinced they know this shit which is why they write stupid tickets. Worst part is I drive two very identifiable vehicles and now I'm on that cop's shit list so I have to be really careful driving around my own town.",

I even saw the 35 mph sign in front of me where it went back up as I sat pulled over. The stretch where it dropped to 25 was so short and very easy to miss, they knew it so they sat there to catch people. Another tick in the corrupt police book, that was 100% a quota marker for them, I was on the job as an EMT in an EMT transport rig (not an ambulance) having dropped off a patient in their home, was not even given a warning.

The cop doesn't have to show for that, but you also don't have to pay the ticket yet unless you plead guilty. They'll often offer a lighter penalty if you plead guilty, because it saves them the trouble of a trial.\n\nIf you plead \"not guilty\" then you will go to trial, at which point the cop *does* have to show our else there's no one to testify against you. But if they do show and it's your word against the cop's, they'll almost always convict and you'll probably get a stiffer penalty. Going to trial is a gamble unless you have solid proof of your innocence.\n\nAh least, that's my understanding",

Officers will receive notification from the county or city attorney's office and are required to appear. Trials are scheduled during the hours the officer is on the clock so them not appearing is generally unlikely. They're not given the discretion to decide whether or not a case is worth their time. \n\nCourts know that people think this is some kind of loophole but it's really not. What happens most of the time is the prosecutor cuts you a break and gives you a nominal fine or dismisses the case all together for one reason or another. They won't dismiss just because the officer doesn't show, they'll request a continuance and it's granted a majority of the time. Point is, the prosecutor has more of a say in the outcome than a police officer. \n\nSource: I work in legal\n\nEdit: grammar\n\nEdit 2: Have a lot of responses after I went to bed and I'm too lazy to respond to all.

If it's graveyard shift you're practically guaranteed a free pass. 2 of the 3 cops worked overnights and trial was at like 10am. Zero chance there showing up.",

You can also reschedule a court date indefinitely as long as you show up before you're suspension date. I dragged a ticket out for 4 years one time because I knew I wasn't speeding but had no way to prove it because the officer claimed he radard me. So I just kept missing my court date, waiting for the suspension notice 4 months later, showing up a month after that and rescheduling a court date four months out. Do that 4 or 5 times and by the time you show up for trial the officer only has a 2 sentence description to remember what happened. Needless to say the judge could clearly tell he had no idea what actually happened. Had he studied the ticket he might have been better off, but he didn't even remember where on the road it was, which direction I was driving, if he was stopped or driving, what make/color car I was driving. It's hard to swear an oath I was speeding when he didn't even remember pulling me over lol",

But if you request a different date or time, again within their schedule(they're not going to hold court just for you)but if you work 9-5 you can request an evening date, if you just started a new job and can't take time off you can request to push the date back to give you more time, stuff like that. I've pushed tickets back for years in jurisdictions that are busy and take 4-5 months between court dates. In smaller towns they're quicker, but also much more reasonable and easier to deal with. Nobody wants to make someone lose their job or miss a child's birthday over a speeding ticket. They'll make reasonable accommodations to ensure handling your ticket isn't detrimental to your well being but there's obviously limits. I gotta ask have you ever asked if you could schedule another date? If you don't ask they're not gonna offer but everytime I've asked the clerk pulls up the schedule and shows me what's available.",

Additionally, you don't get much say in the date or time you get. You can say what you need the continuance for and they'll take whatever you say into account and base the next court date on that.  For example, if you say you want to speak to counsel first, they have an idea of how long that should take you.

I\u2019m not in legal but what I have gathered is that court procedures for these are designed to reduce time and expense of the court, and if I take a more cynical view, keep the process painful enough to discourage appeals. It\u2019s a good point about the prosecutor, I\u2019m not qualified here but I understand police file criminal complaints and charges are pursued at the prosecutors discretion on those, but the civilian misdemeanors, requiring the standard of being committed in the presence of an officer, seems like the assumption there is the charges are being posted when the ticket is written, I can\u2019t imagine local prosecutors are reviewing speeding tickets. \n\nI know how the state of MA works. They allow the officers statement to be submitted in lieu of being present at the appeal. The agency will send a representative for \u201ccourt duty\u201d to do all their appeals. So In practice you never get a no show on first appeal! Now MA does the allow you to appeal whatever judgement you get at that appeal. The second appeal the officer who wrote the ticket will need to show up. I have friends who have been successful in getting dismissals by taking it to that second appeal and getting a no show. I guess most people who appeal are just looking for the \u201cwe\u2019ll drop it down 10 mph\u201d discount and be on their way. The extra hurdle of the second appeal probably keeps the system more efficient and less court time needed for individual officers on their own tickets. Appealing moving violations can be attractive here as one ticket may cost total $1000 worth of insurance surcharge over 6 years.",

If they don't accept they will be scheduled for a pretrial. \n\nAnd on the second part, I'm not 100% sure if they have a prosecutor reviewing all tickets or if it's staff but I do know that they do review all of the tickets that are scheduled for mandatory court and can decide on whether to dismiss or amend a charge before court takes place.

The date on the ticket is prescheduled, which means they will have MANY tickets to process on that day and the cop is guaranteed to show. The court also has the cops schedule, so the first time you reschedule they'll bump you to another prescheduled day. Take note of the first and second days that are scheduled, and try to reschedule again on an 'off' day. Try to remember the cop as well, if he shows in court, immediately plead guilty before he even gets to the stand, and the judge will usually lower the fine. I've won 5 out of my last 8 speeding tickets, with 2 out of the ones I 'lost' ended up with no points and a lowered fine.",

One in particular, it slows from 45 to 40 going from a high income area to low. I've seen all sorts of nice cars, Mercedes and Audis or nicer, going 50-60 in the 40 and then the cops maneuver around them to pull over some ricer or beat-up pickup for still going 45. Only expensive car I've ever seen them pull over was a Ferrari going at least 75",

Unless they're sitting in a marked zone or on the highway, a lot of cops won't even have the radar gun out while they're looking for a mark - they'll usually be looking for different types of infractions (e.g. sitting near a stop sign to say you \"rolled\" it). So if you get a speeding ticket, it's usually something fairly egregious in an area that they watch for that (in other words, an area you should also know better than to speed in *because you know they'll be there*).\n\nThat's not to say cops don't pull you over for BS. In fact the last 3 times I've been pulled over have been from cops noticing I have out-of-state plates. Fun bit there is that they always let me off with a warning when I let them know I'll be in the area for at least a few months, thus I'll be in town to fight a ticket.",

Op never has to say it has video of the interaction, but if the cops is on the stand testifying and sees it, he may think he is about to purger himself and back down..... That said, I have no idea if that scenario will even happen.\n\nFrom my experience with fighting tickets your first date in court is procedureal and no cops are there, just you, and 50 other people fighting tickets, and the prosecutor and judge.  They ask if anyone wants to change to nolocontende or guilty, then if you say not guilty they pause and bring you to a room with the prosecutor to make a deal.  Usually they cut the speeding ticket down to the next lowest level type ticket, but require you plead guilty.  This is what they want, your money and no trial.... Because if EVERYTHING went to trial the state looses money and it slows down the courts.  \n\nIn this scenario the cop will not be there, and op will have no one to bluff until trial, which means at least 2 days off work.  Depending on his job, this may be worth just paying or at least trying to plead down on that first appearance.",

I can\u2019t afford to miss a day of work just to go into court all day for my 5 minutes in front of a judge who half the time isn\u2019t even listening.  Even when an office doesn\u2019t show up, the ticket is considered the officers \u201ctestimony\u201d \n\nWhen I was young and in a somewhat small town I was sure I had a slam dunk dismissal, I had pictures and diagrams proving I had done nothing wrong and about a minute into my case as I\u2019m talking to the judge she turns to the officer and starts discussing what he\u2019s brining over for the potluck/BBQ at her house over the weekend and completely ignored me.  \n\nAnd yes, I still had to pay.  I could have appealed but after those shenanigans what was the point?  Spend another day missing school/work that I couldn\u2019t afford for the same results?

By the time I came up with the money, it was too late to pay it off and I had to go to court. Before a judge saw me, one of the clerks (maybe they had a different title) offered to cut the ticket down to a 1/3 and change it to \"faulty vehicle\" if I'd settle.\n\nActually came in handy when I applied for a trucking job a couple years later. The recruiter was so confused how I could rear end someone with a non-moving violation. I gave her an edited variation of the story, \"The state of Colorado determined the root cause was faulty brakes preventing me from being able to stop in time.\" Not sure if it made a difference, but it definitely didn't hurt.",

I know, in theory, there are good police out there but I've never met one. \n\nI almost died when I was a baby because of the actions of a police officer.\n\nMy family has known, through church small group I might add, 3 police officers. All of them were wife beaters, child abusers, cheaters, or all 3.\n\nMy ex's uncle is a cop, and he beat not only his wife regularly, but also his children.\n\nOne of my dad's best friends was a cop, until he found out he was cheating on his wife, and was abusive to her and their children. The same officer told our family there were 2 entire sections for the mistresses of officers in the annual \"Firefighters vs. Police\" boxing match.\n\nSo, I know there are good police out there, but when they're directly 0/6, that makes it a hard concept for me to grasp. No wonder most people hate the police.",

We brought up that he was on his laptop and weren't close to him because he was swerving. It pissed him off and he gave us a $200 ticket. When my mom went to contest the ticket, the court was basically like, \"Yeah, cops do that all the time\" (getting mad if you call them out) and bumped down the ticket to like 50 bucks I think (which still sucked but better than 200)",

Civilians to cops also can be good, but I don't know enough to praise their merits.\n\nBut like I said, \"among all the bad apples\", it just isn't worth risking interacting with them since it is far more than just a few bad apples.\n\nEdit: my brother tried to be a cop and he is a good man. He was a non-war veteran, got out in 2000 or so. And I was glad when he didn't get accepted to the academy. That is about the only time I ever wished against him.",

This is what I learned from that video:\n\nArizona is California's retirement village.\n\nThe people of Tennessee are some of the nicest people in the country, and are also likely to throw you under a truck if you touch their barbecue.\n\nIf Hell freezes over, the residents of North Dakota probably wouldn't notice.\n\nNew Jersey is the smaller and more Italian little brother of New York.\n\nAlabama is the most religious state. Said religion appears to be NASCAR.\n\nVermont fully intends to succeed to Canada the moment the shit hits the fan.\n\nNorth and South Carolina think they're better than one another.\n\nThere might be more corn in Nebraska than there are stars in the observable universe.\n\nThe residents of Oklahoma would happily fight a tornado with a fucking stick.\n\nThe people of Michigan hate Ohio so much. Though they're almost impossible to tell apart.\n\nThe people of Massachusetts treasure their Boston accent more than life itself.\n\nPeople of Montana think hunting camo counts as formal wear.\n\nThe economy of Arkansas is held together by duct tape and Walmart.\n\nIn Missouri, you tell the time of the year by which animals you hit with your car.\n\nLouisiana has delicious food, incredible music and roads so unbelievably bad they can't be told apart from those of third world countries.\n\nYou cannot walk 10 steps without running into a mormon in Utah.\n\nMississippi is the place where dreams go to die.\n\nA studio apartment in New York is more expensive than six Bugatti supercars.\n\nWisconsin is famous for its cheese, football teams and type-2 diabetes.\n\nIllinois has more murders than Australia.\n\nResidents of Iowa are afforded every opportunity to watch their neighbor states like zoo animals.\n\nFlorida is that state that gets more southern the further you go north.\n\nHawaii gets better healthcare than mainland USA does despite being a bunch of islands in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThe people of Alaska are either hiding from the law or working a job that belongs in Star Wars.\n\nAnd as for Texas, they've done more than they realize when shaping the international perception of the USA, a responsibility held with absolute indifference.",

Source - am a software engineer who's been building back ends for apps (amongst other things) for 20 years.  \n\n\nMost games take place on the device, with updates to the server at the end of a level to set latest scores etc. There isn't a spike of data just because someone's in the middle of a flappy bird level.  \n\n\nAlso, the amount and cadence of back end updates and so-on that happen when the user is doing nothing is quite astounding - Google maps might suddenly decide it's time to update the locally stored maps, or Android might decide it's time to download the latest version ready for a later update, and suddenly there's a spike that had nothing to do with the user.  \n\n\nI agree it's worth fighting, and the system is corrupt, but data usage (or lack of) is no proof of activity or inactivity.",

I check when the last road survey was completed, if the signs were clear and not blocked by nature or man made objects, I check to see when the patterns of traffic lights change and their frequency, if the cop calibrated the radar gun with a tuning fork before use and immedietely after writing the ticket.

Look around the area you got pulled over for cameras as well - the traffic intersection, businesses, ATMs, etc.  Call them, get videos, subpoena them if they don't respond, etc.\n\nNext, get your cell phone records from your cell phone company.  A log of texts/calls is helpful.  See if they can send you your data usage information as well (I haven't looked at these for a while, but you may be able to get info on how much data you were getting at the time).\n\nIf you can get all that stuff, don't just plead guilty.  File a complaint with the police department that the officer pulled you over without reasonable suspicion.  If they don't address your complaint to your satisfaction, you have the options to do the following:\n\nfile suit against the officer with your local county court for false imprisonment and violation of your rights under state law, for violation of your free speech rights under state law (check your state constitution, it likely mentions free speech) - this will probably get dismissed as against the officer (police are not liable for their mistakes) but may not against the department.\n\nOn top of that, file in federal court as well, for the same/similar things, and include violation of the 1st and 14th amendment, and include reference to a violation of 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.  Again, the cop will likely claim qualified immunity - but this is a claim they have the burden of proving, and its still a pain in the ass for them to deal with the issue.\n\nTotal cost to you will be around $1,200 to bring all this stuff.  That's costs of serving subpoenas (via a process server), getting copies of videos, along with the costs of filing the lawsuits (200-300 at the county level, and $200-300 at the federal court level (along with serving those suits on everyone, as well).\n\nYou'll have proof that 1) you were utilizing your free speech to criticize a public official, 2) you were not using your cell phone, 3) the police officer pulled you over in retaliation for criticism under \"color of law\" (which is a big no-no in federal court).  You bring those claims against the cop and also against the department (as well as alleging improper training/supervision of the cop) and they will have a very not fun time fighting the case.\n\nMost likely, they will fight it for a bit then offer to settle with you for anywhere from $1,000 - $2,500.  If you discover anything really crazy, they may offer more to shut you up.  Up to you how far you want to push it, you could even take it to trial if you were really interested in it.\n\nThe only thing that police will understand is citizens fighting back.  Good luck.",

Some people are actually just feckless assholes, and seem to be drawn to careers of authority because it's an easy way of gaining power by default and exerting influence while feeling justified doing so. It's unfortunate, but I think human nature causes a career like this to be rife with people unfit for the role and our systems do not have the guardrails to stop it as often as it should.",

                  "text": "There are rarely plea deals offered for minor traffic offenses, which is the only way there could be extra fines for taking it to court. Unless the local jurisdiction is operating completely outside accepted law and the issued ticket comes with an automatic plea deal or something. For higher offenses, yes, plea deals are the go to way to strongarm innocent people into saying they're guilty to avoid expensive lawyers at best and expensive lawyers plus prison time at worst. No prosector is going to bother offering a plea deal for a traffic ticket with a fixed fine. Enough people automatically plead guilty that it isn't worth their time to go to each one with a plea deal. Even if they only offer them if someone shows up to challenge it the fines are so minor from their end that it wouldn't be worth it. The odds of a judge not taking the cops word on a minor traffic ticket case are so low that they'd lose money if they offered a deal to anyone that showed up.\n\nThe entire local court system, in pretty much any justification in America, relies on people sending in checks to traffic tickets without going to court. They get to charge court fees as if they had brought it to trial, but they don't have to do any work. That extra money goes to subsidize longer, drawn out cases for higher offenses that rarely recoup their costs in fees or fines. Local courts should have enough government funding that they can try murderers and rapists without having to find enough people guilty of minor traffic offenses.",

For some reason, a cop's testimony is treated like it is infallible so that is all the evidence the state needs for a non-criminal trial. Maybe the law isn't written that way, but in practice it is far closer to the truth than hoping \"prove it\" will work.\n\nIdeally you could audit the cop's cellular records to prove it was in fact him. Also, if the intersection has cameras maybe you could petition for those. In reality, the best solution is to show up, hope the state offers a lesser fine if you don't fight it, and plead not guilty if they don't make that offer without getting a trial by jury or the costs go way up. Not an attorney, just speaking from personal experience.\n\nOP should also post this to r/legaladvice  to get better suggestions than us from bored attorneys and armchair lawyers.",

Bring that to court.\n\nThird, call the court and ask to reschedule the day. Pick a day that the cop *didn't* recommend. You now have less chance of that cop arriving at the court.\n\nFourth, simply say in the court that the cop was falsely accusing you. Bring everyone you know to court to back you up.\n\nHope this helps!",

He finally asked his buddies what the deal was, and they laughed and told him they thought he was a cop.

Regardless of the state, always try to play a little dumb with the prosecutor bc frankly, when it comes to the municipal system, most of us are. Maybe it'll get dropped, maybe it won't. Maybe it'll get bumped down to a non-moving violation. You don't know unless you try.

I still had to pay court cost, but came out \"ahead.\" BUT SHE TOLD ME: \"I could have *not* agreed with you and doubled the fine.\" ...I thanked her.\n\nSince you're dedicated to contesting the ticket: Figure out a very pleasant way to say \"no fair\" without saying *no fair.* The only thing that might work out is if the officer does not appear. - Ask around about that eventuality, his not appearing, it might turn into a \"no contest\" win for you.\n\nDO NOT GLOAT.

I'm no longer in retail because my social anxiety was getting the better of me, but I probably would have quit much earlier if those officers weren't around.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, I'm not protecting the officer who did this, yes, that was a bad cop and should be taken down for abusing his privileges.

To do that, don't accept the date that is first proposed; rather choose a date that is close to the holidays or to summer vacation days. That way the cop most likely won't show up because he'll likely be busy. Hope this helps!",

      "text": "Not a lawyer, but had to play one in traffic court once when I watched cop shenanigans similar to yours go down in front of me once and witnessed a cop pull over an acquaintance, who I knew was innocent, and went on an adventure with him to request video proving innocence. (Speed over 100, two unsafe pass, reckless driving, all in a construction zone...fines alone were in excess of $1000 and enough for this guy to lose his license for at least a year) Case got laughed out of court and dismissed. Cop took a job somewhere else.   The video showed that the acquaintance was not guilty (also did not prove his innocence, but that ended up being irrelevant) and that every ticket written that evening was actually for what the cop did in the \"pursuit\" as he almost caused an accident and sped through a construction zone doing illegal passes running a car off the road and doing more than 100 miles per hour to pull over his victim. Sound familiar?!\n\nHere's what I learned: when someone is acting in bad faith, like the cops in our situations, lawyering for yourself in traffic court is like playing poker. It's more about playing the game than it is about upholding the exact letter of the law.  Remember this.\n\nContact the city or county attorney for the jurisdiction of that cop. Ask for both the body cam and car cam footage of the incident. And the incident was a time of 20 minutes before and after your traffic stop.  Expect that they have both, and be shocked if they don't.  You may only have a few days \"before it's overwritten\" so act fast.   As agents of the court, they are required to provide you the evidence that you ask for.  Demand all of it.  Don't plead your case to them.  (It'll show your hand) They'll want to know why you want it. It'll be like dealing with cops all over again. \"As officers of the court, it's your duty to provide it to me\" is a pretty good answer here when they ask why. Demand all their footage and let them provide you a reason, in writing if they can't. That letter will be admitted to court as evidence later, but don't tell them that. The fact that you won't tell them that you're going to do that but they know that you're going to do that, is going to make them think about what could be next. \n\nYou're making them show their hand to you. And you won't tell them why. By asking for the footage that proves your innocence, you can be damn well sure they'll review it themselves.  I learned that prosecuting attorneys, even in traffic court, don't want to look like a fool, or lose, and will not show their hand all the way up to the moment of walking in to court hoping that you'll mess up or not show up.   In the case I was involved with, they really did not want that video, in its entirety, shown in court.   Edit:  Once they learned that we had requested, and obtained, a TV set on a cart with a DVD player to show the video as evidence to the magistrate in the court room, they basically full panicked.\n\nYour whole case is to simply demand all the video, and show all the video in court (The longer the better) and then ask the magistrate where in the video it showed you on your cell phone.  What you are really doing is searching for proof of your guilt,  and you're making them show you that they don't have any.  It's poker. You're making them show you their cards.  Only incidental to this will it show that the cop was really breaking a law and this was just entirely done vindictively.",

The courts typically find police officers to be very credible witnesses. This is why we always recommend taking defensive driving school to resolve a civil traffic violation if you are eligible. If you are not eligible for defensive driving school, you have nothing to lose by requesting and attending a civil traffic hearing, other than the time it takes to attend the hearing, and there is always the possibility that the officer will not show up.*\n\nhttps://trafficlawguys.com/burden-proof-in-civil-traffic-hearings/",

They are aftermarket(100% legal), they are just smaller than OEM. The cop followed me for a good few minutes before pulling me over - I was on my way to work.\n\nHe immediately asked me if I had mufflers on my car because it was louder than OEM. I told the cop I have mufflers, take a look for yourself. He asked me \"How does your record look?\", after inspecting my mufflers. I look early 20s, I'll be turning 33 in June. Cops always assume Im young before they run my info and find my age. I said, \"Take a look and let me know.\" \n\nHe came back some 10 minutes later with the ticket for no mufflers, which he just looked at, from 2 feet away. He never said a word about my record, because it's mint other than nonsensical BS like this over the years. I also noticed the address for the ticket was miles away from where it was actually given - it was a city intersection, and I was now on the highway a few kilometres away. Luckily, I always take a picture of the cop in my rear view mirror when I get pulled over.\n\nI just bought this car off my friend who owned and drove it for more than 300000 kms over the course of 11 years. After I received the ticket, I called my friend immediately and asked him if he ever had a ticket like that or had cops question him about it. He said never.\n\nI'm dark skinned, and my friend, caucasian. **I have owned the car for 2 months, he owned the car for 11 years**. I wasnt clowning around or anything when I got the ticket, when the cop pulled up behind me I was pulling away from a red light.\n\nI'm curious as to how others would feel in this situation. Can I say I have faith in law enforcement at this point? Hardly. Like your situation, this is just harassing the public to meet quota. Your case is definitely abuse of power, too.\n\nCar is a bright red Audi A4 2.0T.",

Docs routinely sew people up with tools still inside them and perform the wrong fucking surgeries, but carry their own insurance to cover their asses so they NEVER face criminal charges. \n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2018/02/22/medical-errors-third-leading-cause-of-death-in-america.html\n\nLet\u2019s do some quick math (these numbers are old but both remain fairly stable year to year):\n\nThere are about 800,000 cops in the US.\n\nIn 2015, there were 58 cops who died in the line of duty from an assault of some kind.\n\nThat is a .00725% chance that a cop will be killed by assault.\n\nThat\u2019s pretty low.\n\nThe US population is 323 million or so.\n\nIn 2015, there were about 1,000 people killed by the police. That\u2019s a .0003% chance that any one person will be killed by a police officer in any given year.\n\nThat means that a cop is twenty-four more times likely to be killed by a citizen than a citizen is by a cop.\n\nPolice officers are still at significantly greater risk of dying by assault than citizens are of getting killed by the police.\n\nAnd those numbers don\u2019t even take into account the fact that the overwhelming majority of the uses of lethal force on the part of the police are legal and justified- if we took that 1,000 number down to the ones that were not justified, I bet we would lose another order of magnitude (or more).\n\n.0003% chance to get killed by a cop but 250,000 deaths caused by medical practitioners a year, yeah cops are the ones that are the problem.\n\n>lawyers\n\nHA. HA. HAHAHA. Oh you\u2019re serious? Lemme educate you on the differences between *qualified immunity*(cops) and *total/complete immunity* (lawyers, DAs, Judges). \n\nQualified immunity means that if I go and do something on the job that is deemed reasonable (by law and set precedents, not the court of Reddit public opinion) , but I get sued, I\u2019m covered. IE justified shootings, uses of force, etc. There\u2019s still an investigation no matter what. If I do something that is deemed NOT reasonable, my qualified immunity does not cover me. And before you go all \u201cwElL tHe PoLiCe iNvEStIgAtE tHEmSeLvES sO iT WiLl AlL bE rEasOnAble,\u201d I urge you to educate yourself on set case law and your local agencies use of force continuum. \n\nTotal immunity means that a judge can put a guy on house arrest for murder, the next day that guy go kill another person, and the judge cannot be held liable for his decisions whatsoever. This is the same for DAs and lawyers. Id be more than happy to link multiple articles of multi-time convicted felons getting out in ludicrously low bail only to then go out and commit more crime immediately. Like that dude that plowed through a thanksgiving parade and killed some kids with his SUV. He was let out on like $1000 bail for MULTIPLE felonies prior to that. \n\nEducate yourself so an internet stranger doesn\u2019t have to do it for you.",

A judge in that case isn't exactly liable to what another person decides to do, just like they're not liable  for them stabbing another criminal in prison. \n\nBeing a cop is inherently dangerous in a country with minimal restrictions on guns, but they also signed up for it. Someone getting shot by a cop didn't sign up for that. Also the ratio there is a bit high don't you think? For every dead cop that's a bit over 17 people dead. My local agencies in my home country don't really use their firearms that often but there have been cases where they did face legal consequences for firing off a bullet when there wasn't a need, e.g. against some robbers who had a child in the car.\n\nSounds like the US needs some reform in a lot of areas tho",

If it's your first ticket within 18 months and you plead guilty you can take traffic school and it won't end up on your driving record. If you try to fight it and you're found guilty the judge gets to decide if you're eligible for traffic school as well as increasing your fine. So unless you have solid gold proof recorded in 4k on a UHD blu-ray with bonus features that the officer was mistaken you're best bet is to just eat the ticket cause the judge will always rule in the officers' favor (I understand why I don't like it but I understand). I had a ticket for going 500 feet in the middle turn lane and an improper left turn. I showed that there was not 500 feet from where the officer saw me come out and to where he pulled me over. I measured it, had a county map and a Google map print out. Proving the officer mistook how long I had been in the lane. I also showed the only reason I turned left is cause the officer instructed me to which the officer agreed with. The judge looked at my info and said \"well there is more than 200ft there, so you're guilty\". Then added $200 to my fine and denied traffic school causing my insurance to shoot up. If I just paid the ticket it would have saved me so much money.",

I've gotten 3 tickets in my life and I deserved all 3. It's not hard to admit that you broke the law knowingly. Take your slap on the wrist and move on. \n\nAnd on the off chance a cop did do something like this then get his dash and body cam pulled. Then when you're declared innocent have it posted online. Frequently people make these complaints then it turns out they are actually the wrong ones. \n\nCrap like this just further divides the relations between law enforcement and citizens. If you don't like your local laws and leos, become a politician and change them. Or be more involved in your local politics. Everyone loves to complain but no one likes to come up with actual solutions.",

The cops behind me were about to change lanes and cut me off but got back behind me because they were taking a turn at the very next light, also no lights on. All cop cars that had went past me including the red light runner then waited for the turning light at the next stop to turn green before proceeding. \n\nMade no sense and put other drivers in danger and caused so much confusion. Can anyone make sense of this?",

I mean it almost looks like they're just hiring anyone and put them on the streets without training in the us.",

It is true that a police officer automatically has some credibility, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nWrite down everything that happened, with headings about the different stages of the interaction (approach, stop, ticket). You will want these notes in court. The headings will help you quickly find things if you are asked a question. If you have to testify in court, be thorough and detailed.\n\nSome things to think about:\n\n1. His video, if he has one, will show that he was far forward of the stop line of the intersection. Your account that he missed it, probably because he was on his cellphone, will be reinforced.\n\n2. Is your truck high up? How would he have observed your cellphone?\n\n3. You can go to the area and see if you can find any witnesses. You can even drop a sign there with a contact email (make a new one for this). This may include surveillance video from a local store. Ask a manager politely and they can give it to you. You don't need a subpoena or anything fancy.\n\n4. As someone else mentioned, get your phone records. You should also be able to get records of data usage to show you weren't browsing the internet.\n\nCorrupt cops deserve a thrashing. This guy handed you an opportunity to do everyone a favour. I would personally be real excited about it.\n\nThe more prepared you come, the more seriously the judge will take you. Guilty people don't get angry enough to do all this.\n\nPS some people get real anxious in court. Its a business meeting where things actually get done, thats all.",

Where I live you don't go out of your way to interact with the police unless you want trouble. In fact, I avoid them if possible. You will never win against a cop, pointless. Some things aren't worth fighting, and this definitely would have been one for OP to mind their business. He was blocking a cross walk, therefore let someone in the crosswalk complain, hero. I'd say OP got what they went out of their way to ask for.",

So, if you go in and have the date rescheduled, often you can get the ticket thrown out due to not being able to face your accuser because a cop isn't likely to take off an entire day of work to go to court for one ticket, so they'll usually just go about their day. You have the right to face your accuser, and if they aren't there, there's no one to argue their side.\n\nThis was actually part of the reason California/Southern California (not certain about up north) got rid of red light ticket cameras (or so I heard). There was one judge and a way to request him, and he would let you off and cancel the ticket because you couldn't legitimately face your accuser..... because your accuser was a stationary camera. I'm sorry for anywhere else that continues to have ticket cameras. Hopefully that ends soon. Until then, idk, try asking to face your accuser. Mayhaps it'll work.",

Google motion for discovery for an idea how to compose it and what to ask for, all video, audio recordings.\n\nYou can also ask for personnel records of the police officer as he's a public servant and they pertain to his job performance.\n\nMotion in limine to exclude any past offenses, google this thoroughly for your state/area.\n\nAfter defending your motions to the judge, the court will kick the can and most likely dismiss the case. Generally the court will state due to economic viability they won't continue prosecution, blah blah.",

Make sure to have his name, date and time of the incident, and any other evidence you can get. Politicians are a lot easier to access, and they hire/fire the police. \n\nSecondly, if you're at a busy intersection then presumably the local businesses will have outward facing cameras that might back up your claim. But most businesses only keep their cameras on a 24-hour loop so you'll need to act fast to preserve that evidence. Ring doorbells are another possibility, too.\n\nLastly, you didn't fuck up. That cop is a corrupt bully, fuck him. Fight as hard as you can, as publicly as you can.",
