Confirmation is essentially a reaffirmation of your baptism as an teenager that is supposed to be an informed decision based on an understanding of the church\u2019s teachings and beliefs. In reality it\u2019s something they have the high school youth group do some Sunday in the summer after having them attend a few classes/lectures and listen to a priest tell them masturbation and sex outside of marriage will send them to hell.",

We had like 7 choices for reading (including the classic \"women submit to your husbands\" reading), 3 choices for the gospel reading, and the priest specifically called out and prayed for families, the deceased, the unborn, those struggling with \"identity issues\", and a number of other things.\n\nMost of our friends and family who attended are not catholic and many are gay or have had abortions or are divorced. In hindsight I'm not sure making grandma happy was worth the whole thing.\n\nA couple of our friends told us it was a relatively low-key catholic wedding compared to what they had attended in the past.

THATS OK under the amendment.\n\nbasically what im saying is despite i agree with OP they should lose their tax status, there are more important things to fight over, than this weak as all fuck regulation. The only reason this guy is violating it is to get into the news, because he could pretty much tell his congregation to vote GOP without actually using those words. Its kinda like cities that have rules on calling bongs, water pipes. It doesnt really change anything. The bongs still get sold and still get filled with cannabis. Its a meaningless reg. Yeah things would be worse without the johnson amendment but its still not one of the major things we should put a lot of calories into getting upset about, because its a weak as all fuck reg that isnt even enforced for shit for churches anyways.",

There is nothing stopping them from dissolving the church in its current form and then starting up a new one under a different name.\n\nWhat was once the Church of the Blathering Hypocrite has now risen three days later after an unholy amount of paperwork filing done by highly paid lawyers with the relevant government agencies.\n\nThanks to the interns at the law firm pulling three 18 hour days, the task was accomplished and the lawyers were paid enormous sums for the interns valiant efforts.\n\nThey would probably lease the same building at a bargain from the former church turned LLC for $1 a year and \"donate\" its assets and holdings to the new church for a sweet tax write-off.  The difference from the going market rate for the property lease and the $1 paid could be taken as a tax write-off or donated to a Super PAC that is controlled by the church.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijxvjL7KJlk\n\nAs you know, Super PAC's can create their own nested Super PAC and that creates a legal black hole in which money can disappear.\n\nTo quote Dana Carvey's Church Lady character, \"How convenient!\"\n\nPlease don't tell me misusing tax free church funds can't be done, the [Mormons have more than $100 Billion](https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2020/01/21/commentary-billion-lds/) and climbing in liquid capitol and they're using it to invest in movies, tech stocks and real estate.\n\nWhen the Salt Lake Tribune publishes a story like that, you know it's gotta be true.\n\nA year after the story broke...\n\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/mormon-church-100-billion-fund-gamestop-stock-gain-tesla-stake-2021-5-1030442617\n\nWhere can I get a 900% gain on an investment?  The holy rollers are on a roll!\n\nNow we have the New Reformed Church of the Unholy Profits that takes it's place.  Tune in next week kiddies, same batshit insane channel, same batshit insane time (I enjoy sleeping in late in Sunday's).\n\nThe same batshit insane congregants would attend, the only thing that has changed is the name and a \"new\" church appears on the scene with a clean slate in the eyes of the law.\n\nCorporations pull this shit *all the time*.\n\nWhen the stench of Comcast or the Blackwater mercenaries gets to be too much to bear, let's change the name to Xfinity and Xe respectively, now all their prior sins are brainwashed away in the minds of the public.\n\nAfter all, you can see that the Devil's in the details and the paperwork filings.  There is more than one way to do the Devil's bidding and religious organizations are experts in accomplishing it.\n\nI yield the rest of my time back to you, the honorable powercow.\n\nP.S.

Why or why not?\n\nAgain, this is a question in good faith. It's not a Gotcha question I pull out of my back pocket because I think it will own the libs (or in this case, atheists). \n\nThanks for quoting scripture.

The only way you can honestly argue otherwise is if you're something like a nationalist christian, where your goal is to intentionally misinterpret the law in whatever way is most effective at trying to turn the US into a theocracy",

I think you'll find that if you look, every major news outlet reported on the issue, and many big Christian networks did as well. It dominated the discussion on r/reformed, where I'm most active.   \n\n\nMoreover, the issue dominated the SBC's 2021 and 2022 convention. In 2021,  the convention resolved to appoint a task force, including an external third party, to investigate the sexual abuse allegations, specifically any coverup measures taken by the executive committee, and called on the executive committee to take the extraordinary measure of waiving attorney client privilege in order to provide the maximum amount of transparency. The executive committee voted to wave attorney client privilege, a move considered so legally stupid that their lawyers resigned. It has been suggested that this move could open up the SBC to liability that would put it's very existence at risk. That was something that the messengers at the convention (read: the representatives of actual churches) were overwhelmingly willing to risk in the pursuit of justice for sexual abuse victims.   \n\n\nIn 2022, the task force released the results of it's investigation. It should be noted that while the original Houston Chronicle article was a piece of outstanding investigative journalism, the second makes a lot of use of the report issued by the task force. [You can see reports and updates from the task force here.](https://www.sataskforce.net/downloads) While the actual process of getting to the investigation is messy because of the legal structure of the SBC and how those things have to be implemented, the long and short of it is that the messengers made it clear that the members of SBC churches wanted this investigation done with no roadblocks, and that's ultimately what came to pass. If you want to see for yourself how those annual meetings went down, you can read the minutes [here for 2021](https://www.sbc.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2021-SBC-Annual.pdf) and while the minutes for 2022 are not yet available, two relevant resolutions can be found [here](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/on-support-for-consistent-laws-regarding-pastoral-sexual-abuse/) and [here](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/on-lament-and-repentance-for-sexual-abuse/). There are recommendations from the task force on how to proceed in light of the investigative report, and you can be sure that implementation of those recommendations will be major issues in the upcoming 2023 convention.",

As used in this section, the term \"adverse action\" means the imposition of any tax or tax penalty; the delay or denial of tax-exempt status; the disallowance of tax deductions for contributions made to entities exempted from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of title 26, United States Code; or any other action that makes unavailable or denies any tax deduction, exemption, credit, or benefit.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20170506055021/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/04/presidential-executive-order-promoting-free-speech-and-religious-liberty/",

An important thing to remember is that while we all willingly join together as a convention and cooperate on certain initiatives, each church is a distinct legal entity and has no legal authority outside its own walls. So while you could potentially remove the tax exempt status for any entity that employs Albert Mohler (or Alfred Backtooth, as my friend likes to call him), that wouldn't have much of any effect on the thousands of SBC churches around the country, because they are autonomous by design. \n\nMohler may be a thought leader and a figurehead for the SBC, but we're diverse in our own way and he has lost a lot of favor in recent years. Some of us greatly disprove of his increasing tendency to draw political lines in the sand, especially saying he'd never vote for Trump in 2016 then voting for him in 2020, and now this. Others disprove of him because he has, in their eyes, \"gone woke\" (I kid you not). \n\nI'm under no illusion that the vast majority of this sub disagrees with me on several major policy issues. But I can attest that my pastor regularly addresses social and political issues from the pulpit and leaves room for Christians to make differing decisions regarding those issues. \n\nAnd all that said, I'll also add that I'm not entirely convinced that churches need to be nonprofits, because I'm not sure an apolitical disposition is realistic for any entity.",

It'll go to the trial court, which will probably find for the IRS. Then it will get appealed. Eventually, it will make it's way to SCOTUS. SCOTUS is corrupt and intentionally stacked to allow for religious control. They're just itching for this case so they can overturn the Johnson Amendment for religious institutions. This will embolden churches which will start using their donations to fund political candidates...openly. They'll have more power than ever before. It will also strengthen \"religious freedom\" in general, which will allow them to ignore more laws, especially antidiscrimination laws, even in settings where they're acting like schools, businesses, or nonprofit organizations instead of religious institutions.  \n \n&nbsp;  \n\nSo, when you report these churches, you're risking giving them far more power. You have to pick your battles. And this battle is already rigged. Don't fuck things up more than they already are.",

My Christian belief is between God and myself and a denomination will not stand between me and my own salvation. This man is doing great harm to the church with commentary like that and I absolutely believe Jesus would not stand for such. Not that I believe Jesus would have supported Donald Trump either... there is a massive problem of Christian nationalism these days that distort and truly utterly twist the message of my faith into one of hatred, bigotry, and violence. And please, I know there will be some redditors who participate in a community like this who will gladly hate on my religion and make some snide remark, but hopefully you can hold your tongue as I am not insulting your beliefs, so please do not reply to my comment and try to engage with an insult to mine. I'm ultimately agreeing with this post based on the behavior of some leaders in some denominations/communities.",
