  "text": "TIFU by giving shower head.\nI (31F) was having a shower and my husband (34M) decided to join. Although it\u2019s normal for us to shower together, we have to share a standing shower with minimal space so it can get pretty cramped. Things started getting a little steamy, and not just because the hot water. I decided to kneel down and give him head. I\u2019ll spare the details because I\u2019m definitely not an erotic writer (sorry!). We finished and he reached around me for a hug with a smile on his face, and then whispered, \u201cI\u2019m going to pass out\u201d in my ear. \n\nIn the seconds before the next series of events, my first thought was that he was joking. Then his head hit my shoulder and I was left with a 6\u20193 man\u2019s full weight in my arms. The shower is wet, everything is slippery, and the next thing I know is the weight of both of our bodies crashing into the shower door, which opened, and out spilled my naked body. I look over - my hand is still supporting my husband\u2019s head whose body is slumped inside the too-tiny shower. His eyes flutter open, realizing that he is on the floor of the shower and his wife is laying halfway outside of it. We both immediately get to each other and repeatedly asked \u201care you okay? I\u2019m okay, are you okay?\u201d. \n\nThankfully, neither one of us were really hurt. My husband bit his lip and I have a giant purple bruise across my butt cheek where I landed. He said he remembers having a long dream, even though he was only out for a few seconds. He compares it to when you\u2019re about to die and you see your life flash before your eyes. \n\nTL;DR - I gave my husband a blowjob in the shower. He climaxed, passed out, and we both collapsed in a naked mess, bruising my bum and our egos.",

Woke up laying on my side. It felt like I had touched God. Ok ok I'm joking it actually happened in my shower. But I had you in the first half. It happens about 1/10 times when I jerk off in the shower. I bare down so hard with my core it shoots by blood pressure through the roof. I can also feel myself doing that forced breathing ppl do when they get knocked out.",

IDK if the boys were also playing the same dangerous game, but now that I think about it harder, we knew it was bad/dangerous, so we had to keep it secret and only do it places teachers wouldn't catch us. Hence the bathroom. I think I remember that someone at another school died \"playing\" so the teachers were very clear that this was not something we should be doing. But of course that just made it more alluring. The stupidity of youth.",

So in grade school (5th or 6th grade maybe) someone figured out how to get people to pass out by having a person lock their fingers behind their necks, elbows close to the body. Then someone would stand behind them and sort of bear hug them, squeezing the elbows into the body. For some reason it didn't work on me, but me and another guy were the strongest bear huggers. So we were knocking everyone out.\n\nIt was all fun n games till, during one break where the teacher left the class alone for a bit, the other guy knocked out a kid who hadn't done it before. We all finally talked him into it. When he passed out, the guy let go, and he fell on the ground, going right into a seizure. We all looked on in shock as he flopped around on the ground. The teacher came in as he came to and stood up. He asked what happened, then so did the teacher. Some girls told and the kid who squeezed him got in big trouble. So yea, we stopped....",

          "text": "If I understand correctly, good cardio certainly helps against heat collapse but can\u2019t really prevent it in situations where the capillaries in your skin are extra-dilated from bathtub, shower, or sauna levels of heat. Your heart can only work so much to compensate such a rapid increase in vascular volume and subsequent loss of blood pressure. Other events like stress, orgasms, or lots of food can also lead to rapid capillary dilation in various body parts. (If the dilation occurs over a longer period of time your vascular system will attract water from other body parts to increase blood volume and thus adapt it to the increased vascular volume. This is one reason why proper hydration is important during prolonged physical exercise and in hot environments.)\n\nWhat *does* apparently help to prevent heat collapse is to condition your cardio-vascular system to such extreme heat, e. g. with regular sauna sessions or physical exercise in (reasonably, not excessively) hot environments. I can handle heat (and cold!) much better after riding my bike year round in Central European climate and visiting saunas during the cold season for 2 years.\n\nEdit: The last paragraph is not (only) anecdotal. The adaptation of the human body to hot and cold temperatures over weeks and months of repeated exposure is well documented. Tourists and migrants travelling/moving from one climate zone to another or between opposite hemisphere seasons experience it every day.",

If you sit or lay on the floor it is easier for that blood to make it to your brain and you likely won't pass out. \n\n  The cool thing is, if you do pass out, you end up on the floor and the circulation starts making to your brain and you wake up.

Like 10 people in a church of 50. At the time it felt like a parade of old men just shuffled by to laugh at a 8 year old girl. Guess that's exactly what it was. \n\nEaster sunrise service outside on the steps of the church. Forced to wear a dress. Was cold as heck outside and I was pushing my legs together really hard because I was freezing. We were in a circle singing and I thought my vision fading and the ringing in my ears was god getting ready to kill me because I wasn't singing with them. Fought it for several songs before I finally grabbed my mom and said \"I think I'm dying\".",

I started to cum and it was glorious. Mind you I have a hard time orgasming from oral but she manages from time to time. Then I felt the worst pain of my life. A thunderclap headache. It was fucking brutal for about half an hour. Then as suddenly as it came it was gone. I have been stuck by lightning, I have been stabbed, lock in socked and shot, I have even had optic neuritis. But this was by far the worst pain I have ever felt. And I should have probably seen a doctor. And maybe someday I will be able to even get in a hot tub. But for now they scare me.",

This was at like 8am when I had been up till 4 the night before (college days), hadn't eaten and I didn't use to drink as much water back then. We finished and my wife got out of the shower and I was leaning against the window to catch my breath and next thing I know I'm coming to on the shower floor having almost bit through my lip and my wife is freaking out. Only time I've ever fainted.",

Mind you, because I\u2019m anemic, I always am careful about having the water too hot in case I\u2019m screwed lol. I was already working on washing my hair when that familiar yet shitty feeling started building up - the feeling of having invisible hands being cupped over my ears and muffling the world around me. I cooled the water even more, and that was my main mistake. I should\u2019ve just gotten out and made it to sit on the toilet seat or to my bed, screw getting it a little wet. \n\nAs I get out of the shower and wrap myself in my towel, I\u2019m at the stage where the borders of my vision are fuzzy. In my panic, I rush a little more to make it to my bed to lay down through it and let it pass as I\u2019ve done countless times before. But right as I cross my bathroom\u2019s threshold, I drop. Straight. Dropped. I hit my elbow and felt it jolt before I blacked out. I woke up and stayed down a little longer to gain some sort of sense of my bodily direction- *but I got up again too quickly* and on my way to my bedroom, the feeling of dropping again came over me. I reach my room and everything was spinning so badly that I swore I was standing right in front of my bed and I was safe to drop (because that was happening either way whether I liked it or not lol), only to slam face first into my floor because I wasn\u2019t in front of my bed as I thought \ud83d\ude43. I bruised my nose and I split a small skin in the space between under my lower lip and chin because my tooth cut into it. The floor is just linoleum covered concrete. I had to get checked for a concussion and I now believe when people say they rattled their brain in a particularly hard fall or something, because *I rattled my shit* that day. With all the dumbass choices I made that morning, you\u2019d think I\u2019d never gone through the near fainting spells before in my life with the way I acted lol. \n\nI\u2019m so glad you both are ok, but please save the soul snatching cock sucking for out of the shower lmao.
