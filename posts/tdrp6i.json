Those didn't stand much of a chance either so I sought males to fight against. At first I couldn't even react but soon enough I had climbed the ranks and could easily beat up an average middle-aged man. When I arrived at that point I was introduced to the idea of gym-goers. Like nothing I had seen before, I was presented with women in very athletic builds, covered in muscle and legs that could break concrete. Tomboys, they were called. Suddenly I was filled with inspiration I realized I had to get on to their level. I soon came to the realization that the testosterone flowing in my body made it easy for me to surpass them, and so I did. And that's when I met them, Sigma Males, people pointed it out. I tried with everything a could but there was one obstacle too great for me, the peak of human form, Gigachad. As much as I trained and as much as I lifted, Gigachad would always be better. But then, something great happened, I discovered a board on a weird website called '4chan' that helped me achieve my dreams. 'fit', as the board was called, presented me with an infinite amount of information which helped me build my muscle in ways never seen before. Not much longer, Gigachad had also been surpassed...\n\nAnd that's where we get to the present time. I have yet to find a worthy opponent that can resist all of my genes, testosterones and things like that. Until then, I rest bored and uninterested for I have come to the realization that the throne can be lonely sometimes.\"",
