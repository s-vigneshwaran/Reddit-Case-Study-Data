But the issue is you often don't see what would surprise you and like 70% of the time Google is sending you to more Google products\n\n\nDuckduckgo doesn't do all this stuff. Which means often you don't find what you are looking for very easily, certainly not as easy as Google. But what you do find is more surprising and diverse",

Sex is a tango, it takes both parties to be responsible. I mean...imagine fucking a woman just to get her pregnant and then not taking responsibility for said consequences. \n\nMen and woman alike are responsible for their own protection for whom they sleep with. We can't sit here blaming feminism for not taking protection, while not taking protection ourselves. Vasectomies should be more encouraged to protect men from any liabilities, and bisalps are good for women from preventing then from having kids they can't care for.",

      "text": "Couple layers to this I think.\n\nI tried it myself, and for \"my husband yells at me\" the first result was a DV support site, but for \"my wife yells at me\" it was a Quora question where someone asked if it's normal that his wife yells at him all the time, and the answer started \"No this is not normal or acceptable behavior for her to be doing especially to her significant other\". So still a difference, but it doesn't sound as gross and victim-blaming as the one you got. I'm in America (Cleveland OH area specifically) so maybe it's a location thing.\n\nAlso it's worth noting that the top DV support result is the only one on the page. Google does that a lot, where if they think there's a chance you're in danger they'll put a resource at the top and then show you regular results. Is it unequal? Yeah, obviously, and they should probably put the DV support on both. But men are more likely to be bigger and physically stronger than their wives, and I've been yelled at by people who could beat the shit out of me as well as by people who couldn't, and it's totally different. So it's kinda understandable imo",
