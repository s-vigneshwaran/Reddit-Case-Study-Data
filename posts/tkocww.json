Why don't you have an adult rank yet?\n\nSpeaking of which, and I ask this as a veteran who helps other recently discharged veterans adjust to civilian life, what fucking service are you even in? That 'stach can't be within regs for the Air Force, and that mop on your head wouldn't fly with anyone but the AF. At least in the US military context.\n\n...which means you must be a foreigner. Not an American. So as military goes, you are by definition off-brand. Being in any military but the American is like being cola that is neither Coke nor Pepsi. Are you proud of your \"service\"?\n\nSpeaking off off brand and out of regs, what the actual fuck is going on with those panties I see poking out from your cooch? Do they have dolphins on them? At least you did us the service of waxing your inner thighs before you camwhored Reddit. Just look at those milky loins. Not a hair or even an after-waxing rash to be seen. You are quite the pro at dolling yourself up!\n\nWho am I kidding. Of course you wear dolphins on your panties. Maybe sea turtles. Your bunk mates must think they are adoreable when they sport-fuck you in the shower.\n\nOh... and somehow despite getting the ripped-dude bulging veins on your forearms you still have no definition to your pectorals. How can you have 'roid forearms and bitchtits? Is it intentional to go with your milky thighs and pretty panties?",

You're a grunt of the world's most badass fighters in the world. Downside, your NCOs make you clean the head because of that mustache you think is growing in nicely. After 9 months you're now LCpl, you don't have to clean the head twice a day anymore, you get that new boot to do it. You get 280 PFTs and 300 CFTs, and you think you're hot shit, but for 2 more years your NCOs still treat you like dog shit. You go out with your buddies off base to a bar to blow off steam, you meet a girl, fuck her, and marry her because she tells you shes pregnant. She lied, now youre married and making more money, but shes banging Jodi while you are in a foxhole on a 4 day hike. You're coming up on the end of your enlistment, you haven't deployed, you have 3 ribbons, you want to get promoted but there are 258 Marines ahead of you on the list doing the same shit you are. Some of your friends broke their leg and get out early and make $1600 per month in VA money now. You try to re-enlist because you have nothing better to do in a time of peace but are turned down because there are 8 year LCpls who have the Middle East Wars to show for it. And then you'll be at home with your parents because you divorced that hoe and will think, \"I AM MARINE\"\n\nPOG: ehh not too much different. Maybe you'll go on a Navy ship or Japan.",
