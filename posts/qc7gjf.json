It goes crust on the bottom, then cheese, then toppings, and finally sauce. If you really think about it this is the most genius way to make pizza. It allows the crust to be flaky with the cheese acting as a barrier against the sauce so the crust doesn\u2019t turn into soggy bread.",

Really needs to be done in the oven again to be heated all the way through, but the cheese oozes everywhere when the pie is already missing slices.",

But in fairness, he was talking about a very serious cause he's pursuing and I probably had my expectations too high in the first place. The second episode was like 20% better and felt more like old-school Jon at times. It's not going to be a Daily Show remake though, nor is it intended to be and he's getting older and more jaded with the system after having personally battled congress for 911 First Responders relief. I felt that jaded yet driven energy when he was doing the expose on the burn pits. It is an extremely good cause and a fight that needs fought, it just didn't make for good TV like, for example, a John Oliver expose usually does. But I'm hoping he finds his groove and drive and makes something just a good as his Daily Show with his own new flavor on it. Either way, if nothing else he's getting the word out on serious issues and he has my full support and viewership for that.",

It's not only the skin, but also the green and slightly green parts of the raw potato that show increased Solanine. Those are the spots where the poisonous Solanine is mostly produced by the potatoe, but not only there. Since it is a root vegetable, Potatos are still alive until you cook them and some even produce the toxic Solanine in storage. While the substance itself is not the most dangerous (but still harmful, later more), it is quite toxic, even though not deadly usually. Stored potatoes tend to produce more Solanine when exposed to light. It isn't the green spot in itself that is dangerous, but they rather show that the potato was exposed more light and produced more Solanine and chlorophyll in and around those spots and generally in the root. (that's the why the spots are green)\n\nWhile boiling the potatoes does reduce the Solanine levels, it does so only a tiny bit because it needs a heat of at least 170 degrees C and higher (210 degrees) to significally reduce the Solanine contents of the plant. Microwaving also helps, but only about 20 % of the content.\n\nSolanine itself has a correlation to birth-defects. Please DON'T eat raw potatoes. While most of the time nothing quite harmful will happen, the later in life health risk are there and it's potencially harmful. It is NOT only in the skin of the potato, but pretty much everywhere around green spots.\n\nYou won't die, BUT there are cases where people were hospitalized (even in modern times) and even some deaths directly linked to potatoes with a higher Solanine level. Don't eat more than one raw potato at once please. Because Solanine in high quantity can defenitely be deadly. Rare but still dangerous.\n\nHope that clears something up, because the earlier post didn't quite get the facts correct :)\n\nSources can be send per pm if asked <3\n\nM",

To me, the primary colors are red, blue, and green. To them, the primaries are red, blue, and yellow. When we got home and could google it to settle the argument, we found that we were both kind of right, them more so than me, but I earned like half a point.

The main difference wasn't economic tho, but cultural, A spoke Italian, while B mostly dialect so there was also a bit of a linguistic barrier \n\nA decided to dress up for the occasion, when he met B, B was in the field picking up tomatoes. \n\nThey both aknowledge each other presence with a nod of the head, after a awkward silence, B speaks up in dialect: \"Te lo v\u00e9 un pomate?\" (Lo vuoi un pomodoro? / would you like a tomato?). A nods, they pick a couple of tomatoes each and sit down eating tomatoes like you would eat an apple.\n\nFrom there on it's unknown what they talked about but apparently sat there for hours, according to both of them they said nothing. I like to think they actually said nothing and just ate tomatoes.\n\n Btw. The Italian for tomatoes, it's pomodoro witch literally means \"golden apple\" (well Pomo really refers to both apples and pears but it usually refers to apples). \nWhat I always found funny, is that in old literature apples are often refered to as \"Pomo\" but now the Italian for apple is \"Mela\", so when I was younger I always imagined tomatoes instead of apples when studying old literature.",

                                  "text": "> There were poisonous and inedible varieties\n\nI worked on tomato genetics and I have never heard of inedible varieties. Tomatoes, like other nightshades, do produce a number of glycoalkoloids, notably tomatine and lesser amounts of solanine, and these may be toxic at high enough dosing. The closely related potato produces quite a bit of solanine and people have accidentally bred potatoes with high enough levels of solanine to be poisonous but I've not heard of this happening with tomatoes. \n\nThis is somewhat unsurprising as to my knowledge the wild tomato is perfectly edible to humans. So we'd expect it's descendents to be too. Whereas wild potatoes are typically toxic until boiled for a long time, so the genes that may lead to high solanine levels remain circulating among potatoes cultivars\n\nIn tomatoes these toxic glycoalkaloids are largely confined to the stem, leaves and unripe fruit. So if you stick to ripe fruit you will never come in to contact with levels of these toxins high enough to cause issues. \n\nAs something of an aside, humans tolerate tomatine and solanine very well so these tubers and fruits are edible to us in a way that they are not to some other animals. People can quite happily eat green tomatoes for instance, you'd have to eat an unfeasibly large amount to encounter tomatine toxicity. Solanine is substantially more toxic but the amounts you encounter in potatoes end up being safe too (not least as most cooking process \"wash out\" the solanine)",

Wild potatoes (roughly 100 strains/species) do indeed range from pea sized up to new potato sized. But given that they are nearly all toxic, these aren't really what the people of central America were eating when the Europeans showed up. The cultivated strains Europeans encountered had already been selected for larger size and and lower solanine content. And would be quite recognisable to us today.\n\nBoth corn and potato almost certainly took 1000s of years to go from the wild type to the cultivated types the native Americans produced when Europeans showed up. Since then European plant breeding has largely been somewhat limited for both these crops, the focus has usually been on producing fewer new cultivars that focus on individual traits; like extra large baking potatoes. But the native americans cultivated diverse strains over 1000s of years with a very wide range of properties such as different coloured flesh or skins and flavours. Today across Chili there are nearly 400 named varieties of potatoes, many of which will be 100s of years old at this point",

That\u2019s an 800 year gap. Hawaiian Pizza was first made in 1962, which makes its gap around 160 years. So pineapples are less new by a factor of 5.\n\nSources:\n\n\u201cThe word pizza was first documented in A.D. 997 in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, by the late 18th century, it was common for the poor of the area around Naples to add tomato to their yeast-based flatbread, and so the pizza began.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_pizza\n\n\n\u201cSam Panopoulos, a Greek-born Canadian, created the first Hawaiian pizza at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario, Canada in 1962.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_pizza",

Early records of kimchi do not mention garlic or chili pepper. Chili peppers, now a standard ingredient in kimchi, had been unknown in Korea until the early seventeenth century due to its being a New World crop. Chili peppers, originally native to the Americas, were introduced to East Asia by Portuguese traders. The first mention of chili pepper is found in Jibong yuseol, an encyclopedia published in 1614. Sallim gyeongje, a 17\u201218th century book on farm management, wrote on kimchi with chili peppers. However, it was not until the 19th century that the use of chili peppers in kimchi was widespread. The recipes from early 19th century closely resemble today's kimchi.\"",

I like finding random pizza places I\u2019ve never been to before. If you find a place with dated furniture, some RC Cola signs and a depressed looking person behind the counter, it\u2019s like the holy trinity of a good neighborhood pizza joint.\n\nEdit: forgot to add that, if you\u2019re a tourist, stay away from slices at a lot of places because the crust tends to be like 2 inches thick so it holds better under the heat lamps. Some places, like Gigio\u2019s in Des Plaines, do it right and have thinner crust slices they heat up to crisp it up like Sbarro does, but that\u2019s not the norm.",

                          "text": "NY style is derived from an Italian neopolitan style pizza. The pizzas are hand-tossed with a thin crust, and usually a bit larger than the classic Italian style. The crust around the edge is thick and crispy, but in the middle it's soft and floppy, and you kind of have to fold it in half to eat or the whole thing will collapse on you.\n\nThere are plenty of other styles of pizza though. You have the wood-fired flatbread style that's usually smaller, and crispy throughout. Also, you'll find plenty of greek-style pizzas. These are often cooked in a shallow metal pan on a gas-fired convection oven with a wire conveyor belt. They go through the oven in the pan, and at the end they'll tip the pizza out of the pan and push it back into the oven for a few more minutes. These pizzas are often a bit thicker, with more dough, and you end up with a very nice bubbly crispy crust.",

I went to Giordano's, since I heard they were one of the most popular places for the \"stuffed pizza\" style, and the wait was about 45 minutes since they make the pizza to order and that's how long they bake for.\n\nI just hung out at the bar while I waited, since I was just burning time before I had to go to work (it was an overnight job). I had ordered a whole pizza, since you can't really order it by the slice, so it was kind of good luck when a younger couple sat down next to me and went to order. They were surprised at the long wait, so I offered to let them split the pizza I had ordered. It worked out because they didn't have to wait 45 minutes, and I didn't have so many leftovers to take back to the hotel room.",

If individualism drove this, why do we have numerous examples of Americans grouping together based on shared heritage (highland festivals, Irish American Cultural Inst. and similar organizations as some examples). I think Americans who say things like, \"I'm Irish\" are talking about their heritage. In reality, most Americans are mutts. Most of my mother's family came over from Germany at various points in history, while my father's family is mainly from the British Islands. I have no idea where any of these people came from. A long time ago, I met one distant relative from Germany. I identify more with the German side because i was closer to them growing up, and I feel that I share more physical traits with that side (though my quick-to-burn skin definitely comes from Dad!). I don't say, \"I'm German,\" because I'm not, but I root for the German World Cup team.\n\nI think heritage is a way Americans identify themselves. We can't generally trace our ancestry back hundreds of generations like some European families. \"I'm Irish,\" is often the best we can do, albeit a lazy way to express it. I think it goes to an inherent tribalism that's very prevalent in the US. We seek out things by which to identify ourselves. We're German, or we're Detroit Red Wings fans, or we're Republicans, or we're Ford fans, or we prefer Carolina BBQ or Miller Lite... It's kind of rampant, really.\n\nOf course, if you do something like kneel for the national anthem, many of those \"Irish,\" \"Italian,\" \"Scottish,\" etc. folks will get very \"American\" very quickly and aggressively.\n\nEDIT: Can't spell.",

I say I'm \"Turkish American\" and I hold dual citizenship for both countries. Are my US-born nephew's not allowed to say \"Turkish American\" unless they too get citizenship in Turkey?

They're both American citizens now. I was born here. I'm what I would consider irish American. I was raised by two Irish people in the same fashion I would have been raised in Ireland.

When the first gen migrants emigrate? In the 2nd, 3rd or 4th generation? When they lose accents, don\u2019t know where their ancestors came from or\u2026?\n\nI\u2019m a 2nd gen migrant living in Germany. My family is from Ukraine (where I never set foot to), but we speak Russian and my family always understood themselves as Russian, rather than Ukrainian, or more exactly, never regarded that as a significant difference (and is horrified and offended by what\u2019s going on in Ukraine now). \n\nWe\u2019re also Jews, which btw used to be entered as a \u00bbnationality\u00ab in the passports in the USSR. My father used to live in Israel, served in the army and got the Israeli citizenship. I also have it through him (and only coincidentally found out about it, because the lady who handed me out a new passport happened to mention it). I\u2019ve been in Israel once in my life. As well as in Russia. Hebrew I learned as a child but forgot it by now.\n\nAnd that\u2019s not to mention ancestry and relatives from various places, as this is often the case with Jews.\n\nI\u2019m the first from my family who was born here in Germany. I fluently and accent-free speak both German and Russian and think predominantly in German, but also in Russian (and sometimes even in English).\n\nSo, what the hell am I? Russian? Ukrainian? German? Israeli? Since I\u2019m only associated with the other three countries via family, was born, grew up and lived all my life in Germany and German is my 2nd native language, you\u2019d probably say German. But I don\u2019t really identify with Germany and German culture, not like native Germans do. \n\nAnd certainly, *they* have never regarded me as German, but always treated me like a foreigner. The first question is uniformly where I\u2019m from (usually followed by a surprised reaction when I say I was born in Germany), despite my speaking German better than most Germans and the only accent I have is that of Berlin. Sometimes they even imagine to have heard my non-existent Russian (or even some other) accent after learning that\u2019s my first native language. Usually the same people who first assumed that I\u2019m Turkish or maybe Greek due to my Middle Eastern appearance.\n\nSooo\u2026 1) congrats, if you made it through this text without your head spinning. 2) Why don\u2019t we just toss this dated (and stupid from the start) nationality concept altogether and finally acknowledge we are all just humans who live on the same planet? That would also significantly reduce chauvinism and racism, reduce motivation to wars and help finally gain a truly global perspective on global problems, instead of every nation minding their own interest first.",

I think their is nothing wrong saying like I do that \u201cI have German heritage\u201d because my family does come from there. But I would never say that I am German, it\u2019s stupid because being German or any other nationality isn\u2019t genetic, it\u2019s cultural. I don\u2019t speak the language, I don\u2019t understand the cultural norms that goes along with being German so it would be disingenuous to say that. It\u2019s a form of cultural appropriation that the same people seem to have a problem with. \n    I think it may be in part because when immigrants historically arrived our country has called them \u201cItalian-American\u201d, or \u201cIrish-American\u201d to remind them that they are outsiders. Also, it is typically people from European/historically white countries so there may be a racist/Eurocentric aspect to this. Then again, as Americans we don\u2019t have a long history we can connect to, so it also involves the idea of finding where we fit in the world. Regardless, when people do this it makes my eyes roll just as much as the \u201cAmerica is number one\u201d bullshit. By their logic I could say I am Mesopotamian since I\u2019m sure far back enough I have an ancestor from there.",

It's simply a difference in language.\n\nWe do this though because everyone needs an identity in some way. We're Americans first, but given that we really only concern ourselves with our own country 99% of the time, we don't think about American culture all that much. It's much more natural to think about the differences us Americans have: race and ethnicity. For the average american being \"x-american\" and taking pride in that, in whatever form, is just harmless fun. Some people do take it too seriously, though.",

Italian immigrating to American faced severe discrimination. For instance, Italians where not able to easily find housing outside ghettos. Likewise Italians were discriminated for jobs and by police which viewed them as dirty criminals mafia. This led to looking inward, and supporting their heritage, such as the formation of Columbus Day and the starting of Latino clubs. \n\nThis happened to almost all immigration waves in America leading to the current pride in ones familial roots. You especially finds this most prevalent in the groups that were discriminated the hardest, such as the Irish. Ultimately it\u2019s about generational endurance. \n\nFor Italians here are some interesting articles to read:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Americans\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Italianism",

I think this is most vague in the sense of white people (which also, what is white? Irish? Iranian? Polish? etc? These are only recently considered \"white\" despite them all having light skin tones. And most people seem to have forgotten this even though we're not talking more than 50 years ago).\n\nBut, for a clearer example, let's say someone from Mexico now in the US. I think we'd all agree they are Mexican, even after getting a US citizenship (they'd be both. One is ethnicity and the other nationality). But what about a second generation person? Third? Fourth? What if they only have spouses that are also Mexican and so they maintain the physical phenotype and likely a lot of the cultural heritage. When does that person stop being \"Mexican?\" And then what do they become? Does society still see them as that ethnicity and treat them that way or after x generations is there some magic thing that happens despite physical appearances staying the same?\n\nThis is also pretty obvious to anyone that is of a mixed race in the US because they don't feel like they are one or the other. There's a blending of the cultures. The Americas, and particularly the US, have a lot more blending of more diverse cultures than many other parts of the world (yes, there are exceptions and by diverse I don't mean between similar cultures like French and German or Chinese and Vietnamese).\n\nIt is the story of immigrants. They are somewhere new but hang onto things from the past (some good and some bad). A country (or two continents worth) of immigrants makes for a different set of cultures and language and how we talk about heritage. This is obviously going to be different from places like Europe, China, or India where many families have been established in the regions for many generations and have a lot of ethnic/cultural similarities already (to be clear I know these regions are also ethnically diverse but I hope we're reading with good faith because I'm pointing out a different type of thing here. We'll say \"distance between cultures/ethnicitites\" is important). But in those regions it is fairly regular to know that someone's heritage is located to the same region that they are in or of their nationality. In a country of immigrants this is completely turned on its head.\n\nRegardless both cultures will still want to talk about their heritage because the past is something humans are interested in. It's just about understanding how people talk differently. But I won't open up the can of worms that is communication and how complex it can be even when people share the same language (This problem should be no surprise to Americans).",

So we should welcome them into the culture, rather than shun them for trying to embrace it.\n\nI was born and raised in Mexico and live in the US, I'm always happy to see the children of immigrants be encouraged to get more familiar with their parent's culture.

I worked as a pizza maker in NJ for several years, and generally love pizza. \n\nI judge pizza relative to what it is trying to be. I feel judging a NJ pizza against others of the same style is important because comparing aChicago style or a tomato pie from  Central NY are fundamentally different, and that comes down to preference. That being said, you can look at any food as objectively good or bad based on what it claims to be. Something like pullman style bread with tomato sauce and american cheese would be a terrible pizza. \n\nI say that to say that if what I ate in Italy had been defined as a cracker topped with sauce and cheese, or foccacia bread with toppings it would be judged on those merits. Calling it pizza means it gets judged accordingly, which was objectively terrible as a food. \n\nDon't get me wrong, some of the best food I have ever eaten was in Italy. I was introduced to foods I eat to this day, but their pizza was simply unacceptable as such.",

If I met an Irish American who was 3 or 4 generations removed, then when talking to them there would be a massive dissconnect between them and Ireland. They would walk and talk like an American, and if they were introduced to me as Irish, that would be completely pointless as they are an American\n\n\nSure it's nice to cling to your ancestry, but don't pretend you're just as Irish, Italian, British ect.\n\n>The state tries to have them lose their identity. \n\nWhether that be true or not, Americans also lose their ancestral identity, you just proclaim otherwise.\n\n\nNow obviously there are outliers and it depends on your family, but this is just a general statement on the trend.",

Usually Tuna, sardines or even squid or scampi.\n\nSecond: \"Marinara\" revers to sailing and sailors.\n\nSo many restaurant use \"Pizza Marinara\" as name for their pizza with (unspecified) seafood on it. (Source: Germany)\n\nAs far as I can say \"Pizza Marinara\" originally describes a pizza with only tomato sauce and garlic. But in my experience that's rare to find in restaurants.\n\nAnother common, and I my opinion more suitable, name for seafood pizza is \"Frutti di Mare\".",

Before Italy joined the EU.\n\nYou probably have a good grasp of museum-style Italian food of the 1920s, adapted for the availability of products in North America, and with some drift over time.\n\nWhen someone immigrates the culture doesn't get \"lost\", but it gets frozen in time, and then evolves based on tastes and the availability of ingredients in the new home.  Italy has gone through a lot in a century, and none of that is reflected in the life your family led.\n\nAs a full member of the EU for decades, Italy can now easily get French cheese, German sausages, Spanish oranges, etc.  This has changed how Italians eat.  Sure, pasta is still common, but your grandmother grew up at a time when people had to eat local.  Now, people can adapt their food based on ingredients from all over Europe.\n\nAn example of this is Quebec, originally known as \"New France\".  A lot of the traditional food in Quebec reflects French peasant food of the 1600s and 1700s.  But, it's nothing like modern French food.  Over the centuries French food evolved a lot.  So did Quebecois food.  These days, the two are completely different.",

Secondly the \u201ctrue Americans\u201d and other groups would treat them as that group, even as they learned English and adopted American customs over a few generations. During the first half of the 20th century Italians were slowly accepted as being \u201cwhite\u201d but before that they were seeing as a dirty, smelly outsider group, and in many parts of the country were even consider \u201ccolored.\u201d I know it seems nonsensical, and in some ways it very much is, but in a country where everyone has a completely different ethnic and immigrant background, they cling to those identities, even after the surface level differences fade away. It\u2019s actually not very surprising, if you think about it, and you won\u2019t get very far trying to tell Americans they aren\u2019t of the background they are saying they are, both because they don\u2019t care, but also because you probably misunderstand the cultural context, as in the man is not literally claiming to be from Italy, but that his ancestors are from Italy, which ever so slightly distinguishes his experience in this country from other Americans.",

The initial comment was why the connection to cultural heritage/identity was so strong among the Irish and Italian communities in the States. I've explained the reason is because those two immigrant cultures were heavily ostracized, creating an environment wherein the Irish and Italian communities became fairly isolated within the larger population, allowing for the culture to flourish and create stronger roots relative to the rest of America...hence why Irish- and Italian-Americans claim a stronger tie to the \"Old Country.\" \n\nI suppose the difference is these communities are largely urban (New York, Boston) so yes, you *do* have guys who know which tenement his grandmother grew up on because the family probably still lives in the same neighborhood. \n\nOutside of major cities you get the folks I think you're largely referring to: people who's ancestors (mostly Irish and German) moved out West and lost touch with those insular communities, and by extension their heritage. I suppose I would qualify as one of those people (Irish) but I am so far removed from my ancestors and my family has been so mixed that \"being Irish\" has no real meaning to me. I get what you're saying about people who are several generations removed and use their heritage as a kind of identifier. So again, it kind of depends on where you are and what your experience is. (*My Big Fat Greek Wedding* actually showed this beautifully.)\n\nThe other thing is that the US is a nation of immigrants. That's our whole schtick--we don't really have a cultural identity in the same way European nations have their own cultural identity. So someone claiming their ancestral heritage is kind of our way of acknowledging that, because everyone here came from somewhere else at some point (excepting Native Americans, obviously).",

I have German heritage. I had friends growing up with Irish and Italian heritage. For some reason they wore their ancestry on their sleeve even though they couldn\u2019t name the relatives who came over from their mother countries and had no better understanding of it than I did. I found this to be the case when I went off to college and entered a new circle of friends and I\u2019ve found this still to be the case now that I\u2019m an adult. It\u2019s always Italians and Ireland.\n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t doubt there are people and places outside my little corner of the Midwest where maybe that\u2019s not the case.",

Those traditions may have been altered over the course of the years to become more 'Italian-American' than Italian, but that doesn't necessarily matter (for instance, Xmas eve in our family was just as, if not more important that Xmas day itself.

When people in the US say things like \"I'm Italian\" when they're clearly from the US, the implicit meaning is that they're Italian American, NOT Italian. If somebody from New Jersey says that they're Italian, there's definitely a culture that comes to mind, and it's not one found in Italy. That also goes to you're next point, yes, where you grew up influences your culture. Many areas are heavily weighted in one particular heritage because when people immigrated here they tended to move to the same areas. Regionally as well as in the local level. Minnesota had a large Scandinavian population, Pennsylvanians had a lot of Germans. In my own city there are parts where you'll find a lot of Bulgarians, Indians, Poles, Greeks, Irish, Ukrainians, etc. These are the communities which influence people's cultures, and which is referred to and understood when people say things like, \"I'm Italian.\" It's way easier than saying, \"I'm part of a community whose culture stems from Italy but diverged about 120 years ago and developed it's own traditions and culture.\" Plus the audience is usually also other Americans. If that same person was in Rome, they wouldn't say they were from Italy. They'd say, \"I'm from New Jersey\" or whatever they're from",

But they all have unique traditions, weren't raised the same, don't eat the same foods at home, don't celebrate the same holidays, are different religions, and may have different cultural norms surrounding family and morals. They're all Mets fans and speak English, but there are differences. And where do those differences come from? From their family, who came from another place long ago. Sometimes you might want to describe a group so you need a name for it. Makes sense to use the country their family came from since that's the source of the differences. \n\nItalian is just shorthand. Everyone knows it doesn't mean born in Italy (or it does, depending on the context). The term is for Americans to use here, not for you.\n\nAnd to your Thanksgiving point. That's exactly the point. Thanksgiving is an American holiday where most people eat very specific food. Some distinct cultural groups will still celebrate the day, but eat different food. It's a marker.\n\nTo take it even further look at Crown Heights in Brooklyn. You've got Hasidic Jews who speak Yiddish and have a distinct accent in English, and you have Carribeans, many of whom are recent immigrants, but lots who aren't and still have distinct accents. These two groups often live side by side in the same apartment buildings let alone the same block, but they couldn't be more different, even though they all speak English and are all Americans.",

But that's also the word we use to describe a group of people in America who have some cultural markers in common (whether or not those cultural markers themselves originate in the old country or are new) and generally have some lineage going back to Italy. If you've got a better word, start a campaign for it. \n\nIt's like how the word American can mean someone from the US or anyone in the Americas, but from the context it's clear. In this very conversation we've used the word American and didn't feel the need to clarify. We just need words to identify groups and sometimes the logic of the semantics doesn't make sense but if you know what they mean, it works.

They may be very different from the culture in the home country, but since heritage is generally what determines whether someone is part of that culture or not, we use the name of the country.

This has turned into this weird nebulous question that can include 'where is your family from/what is your heritage?', 'where do you live?', 'what's that accent i hear in your voice?', or even 'why the hell are you here?' When people ask me where i'm from, I say 'New York', and then they say it again, 'noooo, i mean, where are you from'. Like, look pal, i'm from New fuckin York, if you're asking me where my grandparents are from, it's a different story, but i've lived here my whole life, and I'm not sure what you're getting at.\n\nI agree with most of what you say - it's such a weird thing to experience, especially having lived abroad for many years.

I don't think it's fair to say that \"your nationality means fuck-all as a descriptor\". Despite the absolute fucking insanity of the last 5-10 years, the US is still by far the world leader in cultural exports - movies, TV, music, etc... it's kinda ludicrous to claim that the US doesn't have culture of its own. It's a fucking powerhouse, founded on (some) ideals and values that took thousands of years for other cultures to come around to.\n\nLet me preface this by saying I mean no offence to you or your fellow Ameicans by any of this, I just wanna be straight with you. In my experience, particularly since 2016, when non-American people say anything about Americans or the US, Americans tend to REALLY not like it.\n\nYes, America was built by immigrants but it's a whole other thing at this point. I have huge respect for American culture. There's zero shame in saying you're American, or you're American with Italian/Irish roots, etc.\n\nBut saying \"I'm Irish/Italian\" - even when talking to a fellow Ameican - when you're quite obviously American, have never been to Ireland/Italy, speak none of the language, know very little or nothing about the culture or history or what it's like to live there besides a few keystones that everyone knows... you're basically just saying \"I'm Irish\" because your great-grandmother was Irish... that's just weird to the rest of us. Being a certain nationality is far more than just a distant blood relation.\n\nMy father is from the Middle East, I'm technically half Arabic. I have never once identified as that, because besides growing up eating delicious Arabic food I've never spent time there, I speak none of the language, and to be honest I don't even particularly like the culture. I have FAR more \"right\" to say \"I'm Arabic\", yet I never once have, because it's not really part of my identity any more than my surname (which is basically how it is for these \"Irish\" Americans we're talking about, except it comes from my father rather than my great-great-grandfather).\n\nJust to give a country as a comparison, New Zealand was also built by immigrants/colonisers, was founded even more recently than the US (1907), and has really very little in terms of non-native (i.e. M\u0101ori) history. Most white New Zealanders here have British roots, really only two or three generations back at the most.\n\nAnd yet, ask somebody who was born in New Zealand their nationality and one thing they're pretty much guaranteed NOT to answer is \"I'm British\". Yet by your own arguments, New Zealanders have even less culture and national identity of their own than Americans. Same with Australia.\n\nIt's just kind of an interesting but unusual thing that seems to be unique to the US in my experience. The idea of American exceptionalism is so strong, kids are raised with the idea of America being #1, almost everything is tied to nationalism, anybody can start a \"USA! USA!\" chant anywhere they go and people will reflexively join in... and yet people will bend over backwards to claim a distant relative's non-American ancestry as their own. You guys certainly are a culture of extremes.",

You can get a good idea of who someone is by what their heritage is, but it's always implied to have a hyphened \"American\" after it. But ppl like this guy in the video are ridiculous. We have no actual ties to those countries, it's specifically talking about the American communities. In my case, the Irish-American community in Chicago.\n\nLong story short, I'm a Chicagoan and I feel like that's a better indicator in the 21st century of who I am than everyone going on about their Ellis island era ancestry.",

It\u2019s very likely that I have some German ancestors if you go back far enough, but I really wouldn\u2019t know because I don\u2019t have any idea of any ancestors further back than my grandparents nor do I care one bit. I consider myself 100% Dutch and it\u2019s has never even crossed my mind to see myself as anything else. \n\nI just don\u2019t get why Americans are so obsessed with their ancestry.

I've seen some Chicago style pizza that actually made me want to try it so bad because even though it has nothing to do with my usual Italian pizza, it probably tastes delicious \n\nTHE crust looks more like a biscuit and if that's really just a big slab of tomato sauce, you might as well drop in some pasta and make good use of it. \n\nBut if that's actually filled with cheese, isn't that a bit much/overpowering? idk, I'd be full after one slice..? I'm not used to that much cheese, but out of curiosity I'd definitely give it a try anyway \n\nTraditionally speaking, most pizzas have some kind of cheese on top (usually mozzarella fiordilatte or bufala, which are both a kind of Italian fresh mozzarella cheese, the former from cow milk and the latter from Buffalo milk)\n\n\"Marinara\" is the one pizza that doesn't have cheese on it and it's made with tomato sauce, a drizzle of olive oil, a sprinkle of salt, garlic and oregano or basil. Optional, but some like to add anchovies (I'm pretty sure they're part of the tradition too, but not really common nowadays)\n\nI can't really think of any other \"traditional pizza\" that doesn't come with some kind of cheese\n\nSome newer pizzas don't have cheese on them, but they're rather a contemporary style than old traditional style and those are not yet very present on the menus around the country",

My grandparents on both sides are all from Mexico. So yeah, I'm Mexican. I'm also American. That's an important part of my heritage, just because I don't have a Mexican accent or constantly represent my nationality doesn't change that. Many Americans feel the same way about their own families. \n\nAnyways, I hope that sheds some light on why Americans call themselves other nationalities.

You\u2019re treated on how you act much more than who you are.\n\n(Of course this would likely vary if you went to more deprived areas, or areas where tourists or black people aren\u2019t so common.

My moms dad didn't go to their wedding because my dad is Italian, despite being born in America. Am I American? Yeah, am I Italian? Well, I im pretty distant from Italy, but Italian immigration still echos through my family and is a big part of who my father is and who I am.\n\nEuropeans get so got and bothered when Americans appreciate the heritage of their ancestors. Don't get me wrong, some people take it to an extreme, but still, America was and always is a melting pot, our culture IS your culture. We are your relatives, just a few generations apart.",

You talk about different celebrities, you remember different events, you talk about different politics or country-wise problems, even your views on religion are different.\n\nYou both have the same origins but your cultures split in early XX century, so now you're two different things. If you go right now to Italy you wouldn't have anything on common with an Italian your age, not even food as Italian food has evolved differently in American than in Italy. For example Spaghetti with meatballs, it's not thing in Italy.\n\nAnd whatever you find in common it would probably be a western thing like Star Wars, but even that would be different, as the 70s Italy was way different than the US.",

Not knowing where you came from is difficult, but when we get the story of our ancestors we are more comfortable with being. \n\nIn a more extreme example look at African Americans, or Jewish people. While they live in the USA, their ancestral line back to Africa and to europe/Israel is immensely important to them. \n\nI fail to understand how someone connecting with the culture of their great grandparents is harmful enough to warrant such fevered disdain from reddit.",

(which doesn\u2019t even make sense in this case lmao)\n\nYes. We have addressed what I said.

If the EM hadn't switched from Detroit water (very high quality) to Flint River water (polluted shit because the auto plants illegally dumped in them for decades) then it wouldn't have been a problem. \n\nMichigan's water is so good that Nestle has been making every attempt to steal it and privatize several sources within the state. We have spring water that people are willing to pay for. I used to go to one of the natural springs and bottle it for my own use. It's fantastic. \n\nNew York's water is excellent, but most of Michigan's is also quite good. Your joke fails from lack of understanding that Michigan isn't Flint.",

I used to like it a lot more, but recently I don't care for it at all. Never a fan of buddy's either. My liking for Jets has fallen of a cliff. Tbh, in terms of chains hungry howies hits good.\n\nChicago is also similar. I personally hate when they used sweeter sauce. Pizza is too thick for thay shit. It's also super hardy. You gotta be hungry... And when Its done wrong it's terrible. My experience is like Unos and random places in Michigan. Unos is my fav tho still...\n\nNY... Honestly for me is a pizza I could eat any time. Not because it's the best, but because it's so light. The super greasy ones are horrid tho.\n\nPersonally, I tend to like a really good fire oven pizza. Neo pizza I think it's called? Spicy Slices in novi/Wixom is the bomb. Altho, can be inconsistent due to cooks on the oven.\n\nIdk wth you consider \"normal\" chain pizza with the thicker crust. Like a little ceasers/papa John's style. Trash imo. Worst of every world. Rely on the crust flavoring way too much.",

The sauce prevents it from burning, and the cheese acts like a water proof barrier to the toppings, which with the longer cooking time leaves the toppings and sauce to cook together. And some resturants, if you get sausage, it's literally a 1/4th inch slab across the entire pizza. To top it off, the dough itself is softer with richer flavors.  Normal pizza has the dough on the bland side as not to overwhelm the flavors of it's sparse toppings, and tougher so it doesn't fall over while holding a slice.",

Irish and Italian immigrants weren\u2019t considered to be white until about the last hundred years. And Mexicans weren\u2019t allowed to live unsegregated until 1969.

They are everywhere. And it's fucking rare thst you don't get a good slice out of them.\n\nHere in San Francisco I know where to find good pizza, hell great pizza. In fact, when my mom took me to visit colleges out here and we found the only decent deep dish west of Dundee in 1991, she looked me square in the eye and said \"you have to go here\".\n\nBut the thing is... There's no neighborhood places to count on. There's a place down the street from me that's absolute shit and it's been there for 20 years. People tell me it's 'perfectly fine'.\n\nIt's not perfectly fine. It's fucking awful. Barely any toppings. Uneven. Half-cooked.r\n\nThen there a place that does sourdough crust... Which is not bad... But their sauce is shit and there's not of enough of it.\n\nI can't tell you how many bad slices and pies I've had here in 30 years. It's astounding. And the people here just fucking go back for more.\n\nWe have amazing food here. Insane food.\n\nBut you can't count on a random place serving decent pizza.",

Pizza had similarities to a pie \u2013 with a crust, sliced triangle portions and its circular shape. Italian-Americans sold and popularized the pizzas, and the exotic dish picked up the English name \u201ctomato pie\u201d. Sometime thereafter the languages met in the middle to give us the term \u201cpizza pie\n\n\n>It is often reported that Chicago-style deep-dish pizza was invented at\u00a0[Pizzeria Uno](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_Chicago_Grill)\u00a0in Chicago, in 1943,[[5]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style_pizza#cite_note-autogenerated1-5)\u00a0by Uno's founder\u00a0[Ike Sewell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Sewell). However, a 1956 article from the\u00a0[Chicago Daily News](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Daily_News)\u00a0asserts that Uno's original pizza chef Rudy Malnati developed the recipe,[[6]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago-style_pizza#cite_note-6)\u00a0and Michele Mohr from the\u00a0[Chicago Tribune](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune)\u00a0reports that the menu at\u00a0[Rosati's Authentic Chicago Pizza](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosati%27s_Authentic_Chicago_Pizza)\u00a0has included deep-dish since it opened in 1926, according to the descendants of Saverio Rosati.",

Unless someone is incorrectly claiming that they made a specific dish but did it wrong, then I don\u2019t see the problem with interpretations of traditional food. Food is gonna change depending on the region, culture, society, etc.\n\nAlso, tomatoes came from South America lol. So did potatoes. No cuisine in Europe can claim cultural jurisdiction over these plants, nor decide how they should be used.\n\nEdit: just as a side note, I\u2019ve noticed a lot of people say he isn\u2019t Italian because he probably wasn\u2019t born in Italy. Trust me, I dislike when people try laying claim to cultures that they don\u2019t belong to, but just because someone\u2019s family immigrated doesn\u2019t mean their descendants lose their cultural connections. Culture is cool like that, it can move. Society and culture are VERY different. A society is basically tied to a specific region, while culture is something that can be moved when people move. It often changes a bit with migration, and that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s pretty fluid. So essentially, you can still be Italian even if your grandparents or parents immigrated. Your _nationality_ wouldn\u2019t be Italian, but your cultural identity and ethnicity would be!!  The cultural mashup in places like America or Canada can often bring up these debates.

It\u2019s not like there are some limits to what people can call pizza as long as it\u2019s a wheat-derived product with toppings, I guess.\n\n\n3) These posts about fake Italian cuisine are a bit obnoxious. I mean, call them Pizza Bowl or whatever Pizza-derived name you can think of, the important thing is that who eats it likes it and doesn\u2019t feel sick immediately afterwards. \n\n4) This is in no way intended to be offensive to anyone, it\u2019s just what I think.",

The place I go to calls pizza in the video we just watched upside down pizza where the cheese is under the sauce but they make it Sicilian style.  Jersey pizzas great to but that's another story. Competition between the 2 states ain't worth the argument right now until you bring up Brooklyn.  Brooklyn makes the best pizza in the world without a doubt. If you ever visit nyc do your self a favor and get a slice from Brooklyn.",
