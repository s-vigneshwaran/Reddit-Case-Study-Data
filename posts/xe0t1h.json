The reality is that all of the people ever born amount to a fraction of a single grain of sand in comparison to the earth. We are so small and insignificant to the universe that it would be like caring about a single electron. Even our entire *galaxy* is is a single pebble among the entire Rocky mountain range.\n\nSo, again, there is a limit.

What then? How long can a consciousness exist until every new experience starts to run together and lose it's novelty? How long before existence ceases to feel exciting and begins to feel like ceaseless torture? How long then until existence just feels like a conscious nothingness? I don't know about you, but existing on as a conscious nothingness for infinity amount of time sounds pretty awful to me. \n\nHowever, that said, having the ability to exist beyond temporal time to have a meriad of greater experiences could be great, on the condition that i could cease my consciousness and end my existence at any time i choose.\n\nExistence is meaningful because it has a definite end. Without that end, existence will eventually be meaningless.\n\nBut this is all conjecture anyway. There is no possible way to know what happens after we die. At least, that is what our current understanding dictates. Who knows what new knowledge the future could reveal.",

The old CRT monitors/TVs had a power supply that, after you unplugged it, would retain some power for a period of time. They usually had warning labels to not touch it without discharging the residual energy. If you let it sit for a while, eventually the power would dissipate and it would be safe to touch. Where did the energy go? It just dissipated into the atmosphere with no cohesive structure to hold together. If the circuits are not damaged/degraded/corroded, you can plug it back in, turn it on, and it will work as before.\n\nThe unique structures and circuits of your brain are what makes you 'you' as long as there is current flowing. There is a bio-electrical field and measurable waveforms. When you die and the current stops flowing, the field collapses, and 'you' become unaware, 'you' ceases to exist. If power can be restored to your circuits in a short enough period of time, before your circuits have begun to degrade, then 'you' can be restored as before (assuming that you are suffering from something reversible). In some cases, such as drowning in very cold water where decay does not set in immediately, 'you' can be restored even after longer periods of time...but only if the circuits remain intact and undamaged.\n\nIf too much time goes by before the power is restored, and the circuits have begun to degrade, 'You' may be only partially restored, in a diminished capacity or even unaware at all. I am personally familiar with a young fellow who committed suicide, some 'helpful' individual found him and started CPR. He had been technically dead for a period of time but his heart was restarted and he technically was 'alive' again...but his brain had been deprived for too long, the circuits had degraded too much and 'he' was no longer 'there'.\n\nWhen the body dies and the current stops flowing, brainwaves cease and the field collapses. Absent immediate measures to restore life (current), any residual energy simply dissipates into the atmosphere, scattered as just so many electrons to the wind. With no cohesive structures and circuits through which your bio-electrical current can flow to hold the field, you can no longer be 'you'.\n\nIt's really very basic and simple. To think that there is any other possibility is to deny some very elemental science.",

Without those, your identity is effectively erased (see: people dealing with Alzheimer's).\n\n2. While we aren't fully clear in how the brain stores memories, they must be stored in the physical medium of the brain (or, if you prefer, the nervous system).\n\n3. In the unlikely event that some part of us survives our mortal flesh, it stands to reason that it would be completely unrecognizable from the person it originated from. It definitely wouldn't be some force ghost that looks and acts like you, the way most people envision an afterlife.",

Saying that you lose your old family, the heaven Christians become your new family, and you are incapable of feeling sadness or any other negative feeling.\n\nIgnoring the issue of \"how can you know you are happy if you cant compare it to sad?\" I just said such an act would be psychological torture. And that any being that would would wipe/change your memories, make you give up your loved ones and force you to feel/not feel any emotion would be an evil being not worthy of worship.\n\nI also mentioned that step 2 of cult recruitment is \"give up your old family, we are your new family.\" Step 4 or 5 is emotional control.\n\nHe hasn't responded to those arguements yet.

READ AND TRY TO INTERPRET WHAT THE BIBLE HAS TO SAY, INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT THE BIBLE IS EVIL JUST BEACUSE HUMANS USED IT AS AN EXCUSE TO BE EVIL (and dumb)\n\nIm sorry about that, i hope you understood my message, and i don't care about you being an atheist, just that you're saying dumb shit.",

I can see the ignorant, uneducated schmucks of 5,000 years ago believing it, but not in this day and age.\n\nBesides, 'Jesus' said that he would return \"...before this generation passes away...\", so everybody here has either missed the boat by 2,000 years or it simply wasn't true at all.

I had a similar conversation with my Mom and she sent me this Q&A note she got from a preacher.\n\n***How could someone in heaven have no sadness while realizing loved ones are suffering eternal punishment?***\n\n>\tHumanly speaking, it\u2019s hard to understand. We know that in the afterlife, those who have rejected Jesus will mourn (Matt. 13:41-42). But Scripture makes it clear that eternity in Christ\u2019s presence will be pure joy. We are reassured that \u201cHe will wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there will no longer be any death ... mourning, or crying, or pain\u201d (Revelation 21:4).*\n\n>\tBut notice the beginning of that verse. Before entering heaven, believers will shed some tears as well. You see, even Christians will undergo judgment, but not to determine where they will spend eternity. Rather, God will bring to light His children\u2019s pure and impure actions, thoughts, and motives (1 Corinthians 4:5). We\u2019ll no doubt be grieved to see what opportunities were missed and where we failed to act in a godly fashion. Yet the Lord will dry our eyes and bring us into His glory, where we\u2019ll experience no sadness or pain.\n\n>\tOnce we enter eternity with Him, we will not long for anything. Even if we are able to sense the absence of unsaved loved ones in heaven, there will be no discontent. At that point, our desires will perfectly align with His, and He will fulfill each one\u2014anything we lack will no longer be something we want.\n\nI found this response hilarious.  In this interpretation God is mind controlling people and wiping their memories.  That's because the Mother I know could never be happy if we were separated.  I told her if I have to give up free will to get into heaven I'll take my chances with the alternative.",

And I agree with you that the motivations are self centered, full of bias and extremely subjective.\n\nI am saying that adjusting your ideas based on new data is, at its core, a good thing. It shows possibility for growth and the ability to develop that into critical thinking skills.\n\nCritical thinking isn't some toggle switch that can be suddenly flipped on. It is a skill that needs to be practiced and developed.\n\nMy mom is slightly too young to be a boomer, but slightly too old to be gen-x. But she was still raised with in the typical \"boomer middle upper class\" culture where apologizing is a sign of weakness and you should never admit that you are wrong. My grandmother was that mentality to the nth power. So, for my mom, who is 65 years old, to start questioning those core values and begin making adjustments to how she views the world, is a positive step.\n\nCall me an optimist (though very few do) but I would prefer to encourage more steps instead of belittling the motivation behind them. More knowledge and stronger critical thinking skills will help change the motivators, eventually.\n\nI don't think my mom will ever give up religion. But over the last 10 years she has started to become more confident and break out of the gender roles that made her submissive. She is occasionally standing up for herself and her children against my step-dad, which she never did while I was growing up. So, I don't think she will ever break the tethers, but I do like seeing her pull on them.",

                              "text": "Assuming, for the sake of argument, that a historical Jesus existed more or less as described in the gospels, and that the gospels are a more or less accurate picture of his teachings, he was an asshole. Those teachings are neither particularly coherent nor particularly nice.\n\nThe nicest of the things he said (eg: the Golden Rule) had been said by other philosophers for centuries, and represent common-sense platitudes that are neither particularly original nor particularly profound. The [Sermon on the Mount](http://wiki.ironchariots.org/?title=Sermon_on_the_Mount) (regarded by millions of people who have never really sat down and thought about it, even many non-christians, as one of the most enlightened works of philosophy ever written) just goes downhill from there. It establishes thought crimes and careless speech as the equivalent of murder, forbids divorce, and even forbids such basic activity as \"storing enough food for tomorrow\".\n\nNotably, he affirms that \"he has not come to abolish the Old Law, but to fulfil it\", that \"not a single jot or tittle of the law will change until Heaven and Earth pass away\" (Matthew 5:17-18, Luke 16:17). He specifically calls out a group of Pharisees as hypocrites for cherry-picking the laws so that they don't have to murder disobedient children (Matthew 15:3-12). If you have ever found yourself arguing \"[But that's the Old Testament!](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/But_that_was_the_Old_Testament)\", Jesus explicitly disagrees with you. This is especially amusing given how many of these laws he breaks himself. \n\nHe's rather astoundingly racist. In two separate stories, he is approached by a woman of an \"inferior race\" (a Caananite woman in Matthew 15:22-27, a Greek woman in Mark 7:25-27), who asks him to use his healing powers to help her. In both stories, he calls the woman a \"dog\", refusing to heal her unless she begs like one. [He repeatedly and explicitly endorses the institution of slavery as moral](https://pathofthebeagle.com/2011/10/20/what-did-jesus-say-about-slavery/). For a paragon of nonviolence and asceticism, he also had serious issues respecting other people's property, destroying someone else's fig tree because it wouldn't bear fruit out of season (Matthew 21:18-20, Mark 11:12-14), killing a herd of someone else's pigs by filling them with \"unclean spirits\" (Mark 5:13, Luke 8:33), directing his disciples to steal horses and donkeys  (Matthew 21:5-7, Mark 11:1-6, John 12:14), wasting a jar of precious ointment which one of his disciples had *just told him* could be sold to feed a lot of poor people (Matthew 26:8-11), and leading that famous armed raid on the Temple complex that managed to go unrecorded by absolutely **any** historian (Mark 11:15, Matthew 21:1-13, Luke 19:36-45, John 2:15).\n\nAnd all that before I even get started on the whole \"eternal punishment\" thing. Even if the rest of his ministry really DID represent the most enlightened work of moral philosophy ever written (rather than the unremarkable ravings of a third-rate apocalyptic loonie), his psychopathic torture fetish ought to be a complete deal-breaker.\n\nAnyone who thinks that such a person should be considered a good moral role model is either deeply disturbed, or has never actually opened a Bible.\n\nOf course, you're free to argue that *your* Jesus would never do any of these things. But at that point, we're no longer talking about the main character of the Gospels - we're talking about your *personal* imaginary friend who just happens to share a name with him. As the character we're now talking about exists *solely* in your imagination, you are of course the final authority on what he does or doesn't believe... but he's also completely irrelevant to anything that takes place *outside* your imagination.",

These people have two defining characteristics: One, they have no moral compass. If somebody says they are an atheist, I've heard these people ask, \"What's to stop you from murdering everybody?\" Two, they cannot think rationally. They voted for TRUMP, for god's sake, despite him being the furthest person away from being a christian.\n\nPoint being, we'll still have to deal with virtually all of these same asshole people, only now they'll be even less predictable, and much more dangerous. God is one method you can use to control children. Similar to telling them that Santa won't bring them presents if they're bad.

When Jerusalem is destroyed the rapture will happen. Look for *some-book-that-I'm-not-going-to-repeat-and-advertise-but-it's-about-believing-in-the-rapture*.

Repent and get baptized. Mumble mumble some churches mumble mumble hypocrites.

They rely on people bringing their children into the church to ensure the future of the business. Kids grow up and get jobs and start paying 10% of their income to the church for tithing. The 10% thing didn't come about until around 1900. The bible tells you to give to the church, but the 10% standard is relatively new. Probably a sign that the churches were going corporate.\n\nSo now the kids have the Internet which exposes them to all sorts of different ideas from around the world and that's bad for business. In old days, you lived on your land and raised your food and socialized on Sunday when you went to church and your information was strictly controlled. People who didn't believe in it were shunned to shut their mouths and not rock the boat or the neighbors would think badly of them or whatever peer pressure. The important thing was that you were raised in an information bubble and it wouldn't occur to most people that the information was wrong. Everybody believed it was true that you interacted with so it was accepted as true without challenge. Now there's challenges all day, every day and that means kids are not going to sunday school. They're not tithing. Not tithing means you can't pay property taxes and electric bills and that leads to bankruptcy. \n\nAs a church fails, they sell their property and consolidate congregations with another church, keeping the new group afloat on the money from the sale for a while, but when they burn through that, they might have to do it all over again. \n\nChurches failing financially is a self perpetuating cascade failure. The more they fail, the less likely they are to get more people to believe their myths, which leads to less tithing, which leads to more closures, which leads to less enrollment and around and around until the vortex eats the last of them. \n\nChristianity can't survive the information age.",

It is unstoppable, because religion works best with fear, hunger and illiteracy. \n\nThe evolution of some countries has been explosive. When my grandma was little, religion was part of the government. The dictatorship of Franco in Spain was partially a theocracy. Christianism was not optional. \n\nMy grandma's generation is still brainwashed, but the social change that happened in the next generations has been extraordinary.\n\nWhen I was a kid, churches were full every Sunday. Today, barely 1% of the population attends, and most of them have one foot in the grave. I just literally don't know a single person who goes to church. Ever (Well besides my grandma)\n\nEven we have twice the amount of secular weddings as compared with religious ones, which is incredible considering the ratio was reversed barely 10 years ago, and getting married in a church is more a tradition than an act of religiousness.\n\nMy kids don't even know anything about religion. They just live a happy life, and are adorable, empathetic children. I'm so proud of them, and so jealous (At their age I was TERRIFIED as a side effect of the Catholic teachings)\n\nAt this rate the Catholic church in Spain will just fall into complete irrelevance in one decade or two, and I couldn't be happier. And we're not even close to other more advanced countries!! (Iceland comes to mind)",

As the two have been closer linked, rejecting Republican policies has increasingly meant people being at odds with the churches as well, and that creates a feedback loop where churches become even more right wing and less welcoming to liberals.",

Religion with such unrealistic pillars can't be sustained when you can get all the answers anytime you want. The christian myths are just too unbelievable to keep going when Google exists.",

The issue is modern Christians and specifically american ones have completely disregarded what Christianity is supposed to be. We are supposed to help in society not guide it, not impose our religion on the way others live, its not an empire. Were supposed to help people when they need it and if we can regardless of their beliefs or any other factor like that be it they are part of the lgbtq community (which i do not believe is a sin as its who you are) or anything like that. Our role is supposed to be if you are struggling and i can help you i will. This weird worshipping of the wealthy is innately not christian behavior and further makes the religion worse. As well as the fascination with the rapture, christians now act like the end times are now which no one would know when that would be, we are not supposed to look for the end times but rather live in the world and make it better without imposing our religion on those who do not want it. Finally the whole not just tolerating but protecting child rapists its disgusting and not just in the catholic church its everywhere in the religion and i assume other religions as well. All this is why the church is failing and in my opinion its for the best because they have done nothing but make an evil out of something that shouldve just helped people.",

I don't like preaching to others just because I choose to believe, and that there is a Shit ton of contradictory beliefs/practices in Christianity that I hate. I don't go to church or anything like that, I personally feel that most, not all, but most churches, especially the Televangelist \"churches\", are basically just hubs to push and spread right wing \"conservative\" views and propaganda while using Christianity as the justifying force, which I believe is wrong and corrupts what I consider to be the core teachings of Christianity, to me at least, which is to try love one another, accept and understand one another, give each other guidance and council WITHOUT forcing it on others or mixing in your political views past common decency and compassion, and just generally try to live a decent life without hating constantly or attacking or harassing others. Do I believe there's a Heaven and a Hell and spirits or something similar? I do, though I can understand and accept the unlikely/skepticism of it all, which is perfectly fair. I know religion as a whole could just be the remnants of old long dead tribes and kingdoms trying to explain away the great unknowns of life and death and everything outside of it, or that religion could have been made up solely to control and manipulate the masses. My feelings on it are sort of complex I guess and hard to put it all into writing",

It is no mark of purity or superiority to mislead and frighten the gullible with promises of eternal hellfire if the agenda isn't followed.\n\nI was raised around the church.

If a person says that they are righteous and preach and yell that they are  righteous, they are self-righteous and they shouldn\u2019t be teaching others about the Bible. Most people in church I believe are self-righteous. Religion is man made and the Bible say that religion is man made. I\u2019m not atheist or Christian, I\u2019m just me. As long as I put good and do good in the world then I feel when I die I will be happy even if there\u2019s nothing after death. The church, I believe has always been about power and money. Like the Catholic Church, they have too much power and money (money, and which in this world is power) and If the teaching are true then I don\u2019t think many or any of them will make it to their biblical heaven. Most bibles we have today have been rewritten so many times that things have been removed and things added and then watered down. But yeah I feel as long as I live a good life and treat others good.

I\u2019m 26 and at the current church I sing for the majority of the people my age that go to services are the ones being payed to staff the music program. I\u2019m in the middle of the Bible Belt and have sung for multiple denominations and this is the norm.  Anecdotally it hasn\u2019t mattered if they\u2019re Catholic or Presbyterian. The congregations are losing their young people at a huge rate. \n\nIt feels like Christians at some point in US history got \u201cflabby\u201d. They used to be the default so they could always fall back on the imbedded belief that they are the moral authority. But now that they lost that position they don\u2019t know how to get it back. They\u2019ve gotten out of touch and can\u2019t speak to younger people. The pastor of the current church I work for is an incredibly lovely man (I\u2019d have no problem having a meal with him which I can\u2019t say or most of the pastors I\u2019ve encountered). However, there\u2019s just a gulf of understanding of what young people\u2019s lives are like. They all give sermons (those who aren\u2019t prosperity scam artists) like it\u2019s 50 years ago about how we shouldn\u2019t use our excess wealth to fill the void with shopping but instead fill it with God. That message is meaningless to younger people spending 3/4 of their monthly pay on rent.",

Though it\u2019s a start, a rise in disaffiliation doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to a happier, more well-educated, civic minded electorate. \n\nAtheists will still cheat, harm, and take advantage of you, they just won\u2019t necessarily be hypocrites while they\u2019re doing it. Atheist politicians will still overpromise and underdeliver, but they\u2019ll have found a different cultural framework by which they manipulate you. \n\nFor all its shortcomings, Christianity did serve as the edifice for western identity for centuries. It\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s becoming incompatible with modernity, at least as it\u2019s practiced today. It will be interesting to see what, if any, institutions develop that might serve the same purpose. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t discount another \u201cGreat Awakening\u201d during our lifetimes. The next one could get bloody.",

Colossians 2:8 Be careful not to allow anyone to captivate you through an empty, deceitful philosophy that is according to human traditions and the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. \n\n1 Corinthians 3:19-20 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, since it is written: He catches the wise in their craftiness; and again, The Lord knows that the reasonings of the wise are meaningless.\n\nPsalm 14:1 For the choir director. Davidic. The fool says in his heart, \u201cGod does not exist.\u201d They are corrupt; they do vile deeds. There is no one who does good.\n\n1 Corinthians 2:14 The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit.\n\nEphesians 4:18 They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart.\n\nRomans 3:24\nYet God, in his grace, freely makes us right in his sight. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins.\n\nRomans 5:15\nBut the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God\u2019s grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many!\n\nTitus 2:11\nFor the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people. \n\nTitus 3:7\nBecause of his grace he made us right in his sight and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life. \n\nRomans 10:9-10\n\u201cThat if you confess with your mouth, \u201cJesus is Lord,\u201d and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. \n\nEphesians 2:8-9\n8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, 9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\n\nActs 2:38\n38 And Peter said to them, \u201cRepent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\n\nJohn 3:16\n16 \u201cFor God so loved the world,[a] that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.",
