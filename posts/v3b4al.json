Amber is a liar and it is only a loss of credibility to liars. It's stopping liars from making false accusations and getting innocent men imprisoned. \n\nIt's actually going to help some real female victims, because like me and many others... we feared in the past that no one is going to believe us, despite the evidence we have, but its because we hear about false accusations made by women all the time. Those liars ruin it for the rest of us.\n\nI've met men, including my partner, who have been in abusive, violent past relationships. They never came forward and feared no one will believe them, even when they would open up to friends or family, they got laughed at or shut down. There's been cases where the abuser played the victim and won. Because they are women. It's incredibly messed up and injust. Of course, Depp winning is a big win for men and it should be applauded. \n\nMost men actually do have it harder than women. That's a fact. Women are more privileged and can get away with anything, if you look at everything properly.\n\nIf women want equal rights, then they should serve equal justice like men.",
