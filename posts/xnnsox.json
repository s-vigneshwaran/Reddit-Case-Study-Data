As of today, the Judge has ordered a stay of the abortion law until the sides can make their arguments.\n\nI wonder if the TST group has considered consolidating their suit with the one already filed?\n\nEdit: I just checked the TST suit. It was filed in Federal court, not County court like the ACLU case. So, they\u2019re going a different direction and the cases can\u2019t be consolidated.",

The only reason we don't think of Abrahamic religions that way is because we're so used to them.\n\nI think using Satan is particularly effective, however, because it flies in the face of Christians specifically.

It is an atheist political organisation lobbying to get religion out of public life. \n\nThe Church of Satan is Satanist, and is therefore a better authority on what is and isn't Satanic. I just read the Satanic Bible a couple of weeks ago, and it says nothing about abortion or bodily autonomy.\n\nI love what TST does with Baphomet statues on public property, or Satan Clubs at schools. They are designed to get Christian iconography off public property, and Christian clubs out of schools. Those are great campaigns. \n\nMy problem with the TST campaign on abortion is that it is guaranteed to backfire. It will give anti-abortionists ammunition by telling the public, \"See? Abortion is Satanic, and therefore evil.\" It will harden public attitudes against abortion, and more women will suffer and die as a result. Not only will it not succeed, it will make the situation worse. It is politically stupid.\n\nWhy I'm getting downvoted for saying this is beyond me.",

She also believes people are responsible for their own actions, so she has no right to impose her views about sin on other people. She disapproves of homosexuality, but does not shun gay people or support laws to ban homosexuality or gay marriage. Same with abortion: she'll follow her own principles, no matter how the government legislates. She is in favour of full separation between church and state. \n\nShe totally believes in Satan, though, and having abortion recast as a Satanic ritual will definitely prejudice her against people who perform them, or get them.\n\nNot all Christians are mad evangelicals who want a theocracy under Pope Trump. There are millions of moderate Christians whose opinions and votes could swing the abortion debate. Telling them they'd be supporting a Satanic ritual is not smart.",

One is that they consider abortion murder, and the other is that they consider premarital sex a sin. They can't proper prescribe sex ed and birth control because in their minds that's encouraging premarital sex, so their nutjob solution to both issues is banning abortion and teaching abstinence only sex ed even though it's not realistically as effective as their idealist solution.\n\nSo abortion to them is about murder, and sex ed/contraception is about premarital sex, and neither are allowed to step on the other's \"moral\" toes.",

The main disagreements have to do with works vs. grace and faith for salvation.

If you\u2019re interested there\u2019s a lot out there because it\u2019s definitely the most hotly debated topic in Western theology.",

Women organized to a point where they were breaking the law to provide other women with safe, affordable abortions in a massive, victimless-crime sort of criminal conspiracy. By the time the group operating in Chicago was caught by the police, they had helped over 10,000 women get abortions, and never been reported. Just picture how many American citizens *in one city* had benefited directly from what they were doing and protected them from the law. \n\nThe supreme court could make abortion legal, or it would have to pit the law against the public will. You probably know how well that went with Prohibition, when the government was trying to take something most people considered acceptable, and forbid it because the churches thought a complete alcohol ban would be a noble thing. Which even led to cases where people were dragged before courts of law on charges of drunkenness and the jury drank the evidence and pronounced the defendant Not Guilty. *That* just undermined faith in all the laws, and the government wasn't eager to be embarrassed again. \n\nPerhaps it's time to remind them that we, too, can take matters into their own hands.",

The organization actively participates in public affairs that have manifested in several public political actions[87][88] and efforts at lobbying,[89] with a focus on the separation of church and state and using satire against Christian groups that it believes interfere with personal freedom.[89] \n\n> ...\n\n> The Satanic Temple does not believe in a supernatural Satan, as they believe that this encourages superstition that would keep them from being \"malleable to the best current scientific understandings of the material world\". The Temple uses the literary Satan as metaphor to construct a cultural narrative which promotes pragmatic skepticism, rational reciprocity, personal autonomy, and curiosity.[92] Satan is thus used as a symbol representing \"the eternal rebel\" against arbitrary authority and social norms.[93][94]",

Our metaphoric representation is the literary Satan best exemplified by Milton and the Romantic Satanists from Blake to Shelley to Anatole France\n\nAccording to TST I am a satanist (I am a member of TST), but I'd never actually call myself a satanist because it means I'd have to explain the metaphor and literary symbolism behind the term and then argue about how Satan doesn't exist so there isn't a way to worship him.

My brother would fall into this category. Then there are people who attend and participate in the online services and events each week. And then there are people who seek out and join local congregations or Friends of TST groups to meet and participate with local Satanists in their area. And then there are people that really delve into the classic literature that forms the basis of Romantic Satanism and the foundation of TST's tenets. And then there are people who take it a step further and go through TST's ordination course work which is really where the meat and potatoes are of the guiding philosophy behind TST's flavor of Satanism.\n\nThe biggest difference I've seen between TST Satanists and, well, others is TST folks don't seem to be as inclined to hold up a yard stick that says, \"You must be *this* Satanic to call yourself a 'Satanist.'\" If you embrace the label and Satan as a symbol, that's pretty much good enough in their eyes.\n\nWhat's interesting to me is that if you look at Christianity, you see the same stratification of involvement for individual members, but nobody bats an eye if someone who only goes to church every other Easter calls themselves a Christian. But when it comes to Satanism, people seem to gatekeep heavily for some reason \ud83e\udd37",

I think that is part of what makes TST great; there isn't a clear identity attributed to the temple. Rather, there are the seven tenets and a shared narrative that members can talk about without believing in Satan or anything supernatural. \n\nFrom the FAQ\n\n> IF YOU DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL, HOW IS TST A RELIGION?\n\n> Satanism provides all that a religion should be without a compulsory attachment to untenable items of faith-based belief. It provides a narrative structure by which we contextualize our lives and works. It also provides a body of symbolism and religious practice \u2014 a sense of identity, culture, community, and shared values\n\nGood points about there not being a yardstick and the gatekeeping. For those who don't know, the TST does have online services, which are free (provided you're a member). You can see them [here](https://thesatanic.estate/collections/temple/Temple-Services)",

To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.\n5. \nBeliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.\n6. \nPeople are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.\n7. \nEvery tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.\n\nAnd feel free to explore at your own leisure: https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/about-us",

The conservatives are not claiming a religious standpoint in anti-abortion laws; they claim life starts before birth. Therefore, religious abortion rituals are essentially human sacrifices. Freedom of religion has limits, human sacrifice being one. Thus, the anti-abortion laws can stand. Obviously simplified, but this type of logic gives conservative justices a path out that doesn\u2019t appear to violate freedom of religion, as an added bonus the conservative media can tie these groups to the term \u201chuman sacrifice\u201d\u2026.",

          "text": "Legality and morality are tightly connected, laws are supposed to represent a \"common\" morality. In many countries, including America, this is highly dependent on the dominant religion. It ends up that morality in laws is skewed, the abortion law is heavily skewed, forcing a way of living of a minority on a majority (how we got there in a democratic system is a mess, and is [absurd](https://joycearthur.com/abortion/the-only-moral-abortion-is-my-abortion/).). \nUsing the religious exemption card, is a bit of a cheat, trying to leverage the legal system towards allowing a minority opinion to exist. In my opinion, as long as it's not hurting anyone i think it's fair enough to leave this loophole around, no one is going to try and get a submachine gun that way (it's not even hard in America anyway without the loophole), it can be evaluated case by case. \nThe people who most frequently try to use the loophole have in recent times been Christians, maybe I don't like it but it's fair enough if we're accepting the existence of the loophole. What's not okay is then turning around and saying \"no no you can't use that too\", effectively TST want to use their own weapon against them. It's an amusing paradoxical situation in which TST theoretically have a win-win situation, either they allow minority opinions to exist equally, or they close the loophole permanently. Which sucks in the short term for the abortion law (and would generally make TST less culturally relevant again), but potentially smooths the road a bit for future laws that minority groups want to oppose using religion (usually Christians in recent times) effectively obtaining one of the separation of church and state goals of TST.\n\nIn my (uninformed) opinion, a lot of \"legal\" arguments look like this, being a good lawyer is manipulating the leeway and loopholes in law to get your way (following your morality, or lack thereof). Necessarily one fights fire with fire, which I might not like much but certainly can't think of a way to change.\nGood lawmakers try to minimise this dynamic, good lawyer want to maximize it.",

The Indiana Constitution guarantees religious freedom. The abortion ban was very Christian-centered in nature. Even some representatives stood up and said as much. No other religious views or even scientific views were remotely considered. \n\nPlus, as we seem to be seeing across the country, women are pretty pissed off about the regulating of their bodies without consent.\n\nSo, yes, Indiana is a \u201cred state\u201d, but the abortion issue might just have been too far of a reach for our conservative General Assembly.",

I think it's probably a stepping stone to a better end goal, which is that no religion has precedence, and laws can be rooted in secular humanism and personhood. I definitely don't think what is happening is the very end, personally, but I do think it's a necessary step to take so that we can ultimately put this religious nonsense behind us. Organized religion does not have a place in the modern world. I think people should believe whatever they want in their personal lives, so long as it doesn't hurt others, but organized religion is something that needs to go.

The perverse thing is that they flee any cognitive dissonance when presented with an identical fact set for a mainstream religion. Implicitly, because there is no deity in TST's very young belief system, and the Tenets are revised and reissued via .pdf instead of grievances nailed to a cathedral door, the beliefs are treated as what they are: policy positions wearing Groucho glasses. While I'm disappointed when these suits usually fail, I've never been surprised by the outcome. In this case, the scattergun approach will probably hurt TST legally, though they were going to lose anyway. Might as well get in as many shots as you can before you get tossed.",

No matter your religion, if something is illegal then you cannot do that thing (ie many religion used to kill homosexuals, but laws now make it illegal). So if the courts rule that abortion is akin to murder, then it is considered as such. \n\nAnother thing to consider is how laws are in-forced. During the pandemic, it was illegal to not wear a mask in certain places, but because the law was not in-forced, people didn't follow the law. If we can relate the church with masks and abortion with murder, then its easy to understand why this is a bad argument. \n\nIf you want things to change, go out and make that change, but stay educated and don't make bad arguments that hurt your case.",
