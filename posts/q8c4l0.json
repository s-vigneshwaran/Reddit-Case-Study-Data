It actually would be very beneficial to teach our children that Nazis and bystanders were just people like everyone else. In fact, before WWII Germany was actually one of the best countries for Jewish people to live in (of course, that\u2019s a bit like saying this particular soup is less loosened than the others). I think putting some class time into how ordinary people can be indoctrinated and the damage bystanders can cause would prevent things like Trump. Also going into more depth about how stereotypes start. IIRC there were a disproportionate number of Jewish people in the financial field at the time but that was because European laws had forced them into it for like a thousand years. Critical race theory would teach children to look at the larger picture and inter generational effects of discrimination. Heck, even telling more stories about those who refused to be bystanders and encouraging people to follow in their footsteps if something like that ever happens to them. The focus should mostly be on the victims but those types of things could all be called \u2018the other side of the story\u2019. \n\n\nBut\u2026 I really think the guy just wanted to lessen white guilt by saying Jewish people were a little responsible.",
