One officer shouted into the classroom to scream if anyone needed help, one child who had been hiding and managed to stay alive screamed out and was promptly killed by the shooter\n\nThe cops arrested some parents attempting to enter the school to save their children\n\nColumbine shooting years ago taught us that active shooter situations need to be over taken quickly. In the case of Columbine, bc of the slow action by the police the shooters were able to roam the hallways of the school for much more time, leading to more deaths.\n\nEven my brother in law who is an officer in CT said if shooting is still occuring to rush and overwhelm the perpetrator. Further saying even if his captain told him not to he and his co officers would have still acted according to their training.\n\nThese cops messed up big time in many ways, then attempted to cover up their obvious mistakes. There needs to be a reckoning from this, there is no excuse for this obvious lack of action resulting in so much more lost life.\n\nAlso, Ted Cruz is a scumbag",

The guy who was attack was an inch from death with massive damage from the knife.\n\nThe other was a woman who had a restraining order against her husband/ex husband who had taken her 2 or 3 daughters , they were his kids too but he was not allowed to be near them, she reported it, cops did nothing. Continued to report it, even going to the station, they still ignored her, eventually he showed up to the station got out and shot himself, the kids were found dead in the truck. The police were found not responsible, similar to the first case. \n\nEnds up judges ruled that police are not legally obligated to help/protect citizens. Seems crazy, but completely true \n\nAnd they still want us to \"support the police\" or \"back the blue\" when they don't have our backs?\n\nLike I said my brother in law is a cop, and a pretty good one and there are good police for sure, but this is insanity",

Passing laws does make a difference, as evidenced by numerous nations with tight gun regulations (even including ones with well established gun cultures like Switzerland) having very low gun crime rates. If you make guns generally much more difficult to acquire, gun crime rates and mass shootings drop. What a shocker. But the thing is, laws have to be consistently strict among all states. Having tight laws in one state and lax ones in a near state doesn't really achieve much. There is an evident problem in a nation where getting guns is that easy. Denying this is asinine.

Why is this so difficult to admit? Why don't proponents of this silly argument understand the concept of threshold? Just because a person really really keen on shooting people might succeed in finding a gun doesn't mean strict gun regulations don't have an impact and that all mentally ill people are equally likely to pursue guns. The mere availability and ease of acquisition makes it much a much more attractive prospect to the mentally ill. \n\nLet's say you have a bunch of kids with different temperaments and therefore different levels of willingness to take risks. They all love candy. Their mom says they can't have any till after dinner. In scenario A she hides the candy. In scenario B she doesn't and it's just lying around and she trusts the kids not to touch it and follow her rule. In scenario A there's an obvious risk involved in trying to break into mom's hiding place and sneak in some candy. She might find out. She might catch them red handed etc. Most kids won't try it, but the most risk taking would because they're that keen and bold. In scenario B much more kids would because the barrier is basically not there and the risk is much lower. Your line of reasoning would have us believe that hiding the candy would not a achieve a thing because \"if the kids want candy they'd find it\" but this is not how it works. Setting up barriers does mean that a certain number of them would refrain from doing so which would reduce the amount of candy consumed. \nWhen you're addicted to something and want to overcome that addiction, you do your best to minimize the availability of the source of addiction to you. You don't leave the source staring at you and go \"meh it doesn't matter because I'm gonna end up getting to it anyway.\" \n\nAt the end of the day, your hypothesis runs in the face of empirical evidence. Countries with tighter gun control and fewer guns in circulation (regardless of mental health levels!) have much lower gun crime rates.",

Considering every developed nation has better gun control than US, not sure what point you think you\u2019re making.  Even if you can cite specific nations that have higher rates of crime, I doubt even one would be considered a peer nation (wealthy, developed).\nhttps://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-gun-policy-global-comparisons\n\nCriminals don\u2019t follow laws is the most illogical and asinine excuse.  Using that \u201clogic\u201d why have *any* laws at all?  \n\nHow many mass death events from bombings have we had in the US?  Oklahoma City Fed Building comes to mind and\u2026?  I\u2019m sure there are others but, incomparable to mass shootings.  I won\u2019t deny that if someone wants to kill many & couldn\u2019t access assault rifles or other firearms they may try a bomb.  But, frequently homemade bombs don\u2019t work (Aurora, Columbine, Jan 6 just off the top of my head) & law enforcement is currently much better at detecting bomb making activities than flagging people that shouldn\u2019t have access to firearms (admittedly, that\u2019s a tall order because of the \u201cmore guns than people\u201d fact.)\n\nDriving a car through a crowd?!  I\u2019ll take my chances at getting out of the way of a crazed driver any day over getting out of the way of a .223 fired from an AR15.  Wouldn\u2019t you?  Btw I have an AR like everybody else, couldn\u2019t fall behind in the arms race against fellow citizens.  I\u2019d happily turn it in but, I don\u2019t think they should be taken from current owners (yet), but I also wouldn\u2019t mind.  Moot point though, because that won\u2019t happen anytime soon, if ever.\n\nGlad you brought up cars.  Look at all we have to do to legally drive a car, because it *might* hurt someone.  Cars are built for transport, not murder.  It shouldn\u2019t be easier to get an assault rifle than a drivers license imho.  Hair stylists have to get 1200 hrs of education because they use products that can cause chemical burns FFS.  Before you tell me driving isn\u2019t a right guaranteed by the Constitution, see former Chief Justice Burger\u2019s comments linked below.\n\n\u201c\u2026 very few if any mass shooting the 4 years prior to our new leader.\u201d  WOW not sure if that\u2019s confidently incorrect or tragically incorrect (both lol).  Remember these?  Parkland, Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Santa Fe (TX), Tree of Life in Pittsburgh, Thousand Oaks, El Paso Walmart & many, many more.  There were less during the pandemic because it\u2019s hard to commit a mass shooting when masses can\u2019t gather.  \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mass_shootings_in_the_United_States\n\nCouple other things I hope you\u2019ll consider.  The left blames guns & proposes legislation to address what they believe is the problem.  The right blames mental health and\u2026? Not only do they *not* propose legislation to address what they believe to be the problem, they vote against any proposals to fund better access to mental health care.  Two years ago the GOP proposed a bill to combat domestic terrorism.  It didn\u2019t pass.  But, when Dems put up a nearly identical bill, the GOP all vote against it (last week iirc).  Repugs are good at bitching & moaning about our problems (always blame \u201clibs\u201d) but, years ago they stopped offering any actual solutions to anything they complain about.  & I mean real solutions & legislation, not what they say on TV (often without solutions, still).  While there are plenty of terrible politicians on both sides, both sides are not equally terrible.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with what former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger said about 2A?  If not, please watch:\nhttps://youtu.be/Eya_k4P-iEo\n\nSorry but, all I see are bad faith arguments.  Most of us see that, the entire rest of the planet sees that & looks on in horror, aghast that we don\u2019t try to stop this insanity.  *That* weakens us on the world stage!\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1039791\n\nI really hope you look at some of these links.

These particular terrorists in Canada are primarily remembered as French separatists, but left wing politics were also part of their wheelhouse. They were called the FLQ. Anyway, the Mounties were in charge of gathering intelligence on them and finding a way to put them in prison. It shouldn\u2019t have been hard, at the height of the crisis the FLQ had kidnapped and killed the Quebec Labour Minister and also planted bombs everywhere they could. But you know what the Mounties did to solidify their justification for targeting the FLQ? A bunch of illegal shit. For instance, they stole a load of dynamite from a warehouse and blamed the FLQ. In addition a cop named Corporal Robert Samson blew his own hands off handling a bomb that was to be planted and testified that he had done even worst in service of the RCMP, kicking off the MacDonald inquiry which looked into illegal acts of Canada\u2019s top police force. It was learned the RCMP engaged in illegal mail opening, illegal surveillance, burglary, forgery, and burning down a barn where the FLQ and Black Panther\u2019s were set to meet.\n\nAs a result the RCMP\u2019s domestic intelligence service was (supposed) to be dissolved and handed off to a new agency, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, CSIS, newly responsible for both foreign and domestic intelligence, separate from enforcement.",

Saying that government imposes these consequences yet you still have a \u201cright\u201d to free speech in those instances makes no sense. \n\nGovernment imposes consequences for speech such as inciting violence against others, slander, libel, etc. Therefore people do not have a \u201cright\u201d to slander, libel, etc. It\u2019s why those things aren\u2019t \u201cprotected\u201d by the First Amendment. \n\nWe understand\u2014 correctly\u2014 the right to free speech to be the right to speak free of government consequences. \n\nSaying that I\u2019m free to say something for which the government may impose consequences can only mean that I am physically free to say it\u2014 I can get the words out of my mouth\u2014 not that I have the legal right to freely say it.

It's in-person, but it's all day every day for a while.\n\nIn-person early voting for the November general election this year, for example, goes from [Monday, Oct 24, through Friday, November 4](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/voter/important-election-dates.shtml).\n\nYou can't have a mail-in ballot [unless you're 65 or disabled](https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/reqabbm.shtml), and you might have to deal with maliciously inconvenient and/or inadequate polling stations in your district, but they at least give you two full weeks.\n\n(am texas resident trying to make the best of things)",

If that specific precedent doesn't exist, then they're considered immune because they couldn't possibly have known. Not even kidding. That's how nakedly corrupt the US justice system is. It's not even that they won't bring charges. The system protects cops from accountability from the ground up. Even if they did bring charges there would be a 0.0% chance of the cops being found personally guilty or liable for any aspect of their behavior.",

The story needs to blow up. She basically told them give me a vest or go in there yourselves and then she went in.  She had 2 kids in 2 different classrooms and found them both while freeing other kids in the classes.\n\nImportant to note, she heard multiple gun shots while she was sneaking around in the school looking for her kids. She heard shits that killed children while she was looking for her own and the police were standing outside with weapons and vests.",

Pay for a fancy dinner and make a donation and you might be given a card with a high ranking police officers contact information. You get in trouble and as long as its not something super serious, you contact the person on the card and things get swept under the rug. You get minimal charges, if charged at all.\n\nThey don't care about corporate interests, they care about the people that pay them. Corporations have realized they can make donations that more than pay for themselves. Its like the whole joke about Donuts and cops.\n\nWell part of that relationship exists is because many donut shops realized that offering cops a free donut and a free coffee is dirt cheap. But it results in your shop constantly having police protection and being one of the last places a criminal wants to rob.\n\nThe police are in it for themselves and only themselves.",

It's very common.\n\nA moose will also abandon its calf to save its own skin. It doesn't have to very often, but it will. All deer do.\n\nPenguins only adopt eggs/chicks if they can't have their own (eg, gay) or if theirs dies. Also, they don't adopt orphans (orphans die too quickly to get adopted), they just steal eggs/chicks from other penguin parents. Sometimes so many penguin parents are trying to steal a chick that they trample the chick to death. Seen that shit on BBC.",

I say \u201cmy friends\u201d in particular because a few of them, the prior day, had an interaction in which he pulled a knife unprovoked.

But, hey, it's all accidental, right? I mean, a toddler sleeping in a crib is a threat to an armored-up, heavily armed tactical officer's life, right? Little kid might have giggled at them or something. Can't have that. Better toss an explosive device designed to incapacitate a room full of fully grown and developed people into the confined space of a crib containing a single sleeping toddler in case he gets cranky and starts taking out these trained and equipped 'professionals'.\n\nStop being an apologist for people who have yet to apologize for their own actions.",

There are a lot of ways to deal with regulation that don't require having police March into people's houses and drag them to jail.\n\nI'm fully admit that it's a fantasy that we'd ever get to that point in the first place, just pointing out that it's not impossible to make it work.",

And you *damn sure* need to give a better rebuttal than that word salad to incidences of cops going away and crime going with them.\n\nYou are being *incredibly* lazy, refusing to give sources, and giving retorts that barely even qualify as handwaves because of how intensely vague and meaningless they are.\n\n> If you actually read that source you would see that it wasn\u2019t because the police was gone that crime was reduced, it was bc how the police operates\n\nTrying to parse this as much as I can, you're seemingly claiming that it's not because the cops stopped policing, it's because they stopped doing what cops do...\n\nWhich is policing.\n\nYes, the fact that how cops operate seems to *increase* crime is one of the main justifications for defunding the police. *It is a fundamentally broken institution*.\n\nPeople arguing for defunding the *police* are not arguing for doing nothing about crime. They're arguing that policing is a fundamental broken model for dealing with it. They're pointing to other avenues *besides* institutionalized violence and imprisonment.\n\nYour argument, as much as I can understand it, and borrowing from your own metaphor, is like arguing that it's \"obvious\" that the problem with breathing carbon monoxide or ammonia is simply that the person needs *more* of it -- while everyone else is saying \"hey we get better results if we eliminate those two chemicals and replace them with oxygen instead, we're pretty sure those chemicals are actually making things worse.\"",

Just told you what you now claim to already know.\n\nConversations do not need to be competitive. Perhaps a difficult concept for you to grasp, but the idea may be to desensitize people just enough to have a baseline conversation that could potentially end in more intuitive agreement. It is rare, unfortunately, but does occur, especially as people become more familiar with a topic on an emotionally neutral level. I believe it is also crucial, as it is a community responsibility to keep others grounded in reality, lest people continue to be susceptible to psychosis and otherwise fly off the handle. It is nonetheless a rather futile goal on my part as I tend to forget the public is increasingly unwell and devolving into the blind leading the blind, but I digress as I\u2019ve nothing else to lose or hold onto. \n\n> I'm more inclined to believe your goal was to upset people\n\nIf I wanted to do that, I would just commit apathetic  crimes against humanity, not unlike the motives of the shooter in question. Like I\u2019ve stated, nothing to lose, however devoid of empathy I am not. You couldn\u2019t understand in the context of Reddit comments.",

You believe it was staged because for some reason you can\u2019t fathom the possibility that you were wrong about the police in your area. The police DID permit such an atrocity and let kids die because they were too chicken shit to do their job. That\u2019s not a narrative that is a FACT. Every time a mass shooting happens with an AR, there is always a call for gun control this isn\u2019t new. There is no narrative being spun. It\u2019s common sense to push for gun control when shit like this happens. Nobody needs to stage a school shooting to push that, the United States has MORE THAN ENOUGH school shootings to reflect on when trying to push gun control. The locals and you need to start doing some reflecting on the police around you and your gun laws instead of jumping through hoops trying to convince yourself kids died for a narrative. But honestly you\u2019re too yellow bellied to even take a stand that you think it\u2019s staged to begin with so I\u2019m not surprised.",

It\u2019s not your place to assume my beliefs or direct this entire string of replies; my post may be written and submitted with more cryptic and personal purposes unless otherwise clarified, such as conditioning or feedback inquiries. You most certainly do not understand my motives or more private thoughts. But more gun control is absolutely the wrong perspective to take and shows complete failure of resolve on your part. That campus, and many others, need security, but I do not agree with republicans wanting to arm teachers as that is a failure of resolve on their part. On the contrary, I advocate for and agree with a system that has already been implemented in other parts of Texas and have grown up with, mainly security personnel stationed on campus, as that has proven an effective countermeasure. There is no other need for research or solution to something that has been and can continue to be further patched. \n\nI do not agree with you, however, and this conversation is fruitless and will cease.",

Neither side can sit there and say cops did a good job. Now both sides of the isle are being forced to look at the shit show that is our policing system. Those officers are obviously not fit for the job, and even if they were they\u2019re clearly not trained properly to do the job. Arresting parents, and using unnecessary brutality reflects on what the brown and black community have been trying to telling people for decades.  Cops are aggressive, incompetent fools who are not here to protect anyone but themselves. They have always used their power to force people into silence. This isn\u2019t new for them, \u201closing\u201d body cam footage, flat out keeping body cams off during interactions is the norm.",

But the police have been dealt an horrendous card as the government cut the number of police by over 20,000. That means there just isn't enough of them to deal with all the crime. Some forces are so under-resourced that they don't even respond to low level crime anymore. Couple that with a few serious cases of police criminality then public confidence in the police is on the floor.",

As opposed to what actually happened- the cops didn\u2019t even try to save your child and they\u2019re just walking around and collecting their paycheck and will likely never get punished for allowing all these kids to die. That second one would be another massive layer of trauma on top of the horrible pain of losing a child. \n\nI really hope these parents receive some sort of justice but I honestly don\u2019t see it happening.",

He wounded two of the higher-ranking officers on the scene (it\u2019s very possible they returned fire through the door and killed a kid, but that has yet to be and probably never will be confirmed or denied) \n\nAnother officer on the scene was on the phone with his wife, one of the teachers who ended up dying. The information from that call *must* have had something to do with why they treated an active shooter as a barricaded shooter, for lack of *any* other possible explanation of that fuck up.\n\nSo, the shooter disrupted their command structure, and they had some kind of information from inside the room that made them decide to hesitate. \n\nThey cops who actually breached the room were not uvalde cops, they were border patrol agents. It seems like *they too* were comfortable waiting in the hall until they had a key for the door, and only decided to disregard the chain of command after they had the key and still no command to breach was given.\n\nI believe the *harrowing* story of what occurred to that poor girl who did as police asked and called for help happened immediately after the breach. The shooter fled to the adjoining classroom, the cops in the breached room were too stupid to figure that out, shouted for signs of life (which should absolutely not have been done before shooter was neutralized) and only once he started murdering more children did they finally do what you\u2019re supposed to do- keep pushing no matter what and neutralize the shooter at all costs -that\u2019s all speculation on my part\n\nI really suspect returning fire through the door and accidentally shooting a kid (maybe one the shooter was using as a shield?) is likely to be a major reason why they hesitated so long, and why they lied so desperately",

Bringing back the fairness doctrine will help. We also need to stop allowing entertainment to be associated with news in the way it is today.\n\nOutside of that a lot of issues would tamper off if people would stop feverishly watching the news for the next thing to be scared of. Tensions rise in a cyclical nature. Once someone is so scared that they feel they have to do something about it, it escalates the situation.\n\nAfter that, it would be nice if we could stop jerrymandering and get in a younger demographic of senators that more accurately reflect modern views. We will have people in congress and the senate that supported segregation, some of them that actually participated in hate rallies of the 60s/70s. Just brushed under the rug. It shouldnt be too much to ask to get some under the age of 65, that's over half of our congress.\n\nYou ask your average conservative about their views outside of what they heard on the news youd be surprised how much more sound they are when they arent led on. But you really need to get deep into the why. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe truth of the matter is, that because of all of this we are actually still stuck in the 1960s/70s. Look at all the parallels, the people in charge have never moved on and at this point its too convenient to move on from.",

They can track legally sold weapons.  Don't worry though, America has pissed off a LOT of people so any resistance here wouldn't have difficulty getting weapons.\n\nAlso, it wouldn't be ALL guns just weapons like AR-15s (which are the basis for the military weapon the M-16. The only difference is that the AR-15 isn't fully auto, but spraying and praying isn't a great tactic anyways.  And while Trump outlawed bump stocks I think you can still find them.  That allows an AR-15 to be fired at an automatic rate while only losing a little bit of accuracy.)",

No excuse.\n\nBut there is a reason you DON'T let civilians run into an active shooter situation. First, you don't want to risk more deaths. Secondly, you don't want officers to mistake them for the shooter or an accomplice/additional shooter and mistakenly shoot them. Obviously not relevant if the police aren't responding by actually going in, but... when they do it right that IS a risk.",

As in... when police do what they're SUPPOSED TO DO (not what they actually did), civilians are prevented from going in for X reason.\n\nIf you had kids, would you tell them to wear sunscreen when they go to the beach with you to prevent sunburn? Yes. Because that's the correct thing to do in light of the fact you are going to the beach.\n\nIf it is cloudy, at night, and super cold because the beach is in the polar region and it's the time of year when it is dark 24/7 due to the tilt of the earth and they're dressed in winter gear... would you still make them wear sunscreen at the beach? No. Because while technically you are at the beach... you aren't \"going to the beach\" in the normal sense. So following the sunscreen rule really doesn't apply.\n\nNow. If you have intelligence, re-read what I wrote and apply the sunscreen duo scenario to the SUPPOSED TO DO vs ACTUALLY DID scenario. Do you see the difference between what you THINK I claim and what I actually claimed? \n\nIf so, good. You have intelligence.\n\nIf not, then you need your license to type revoked.",

We need to all work toward a freer society. All those \"free Johnny Depp\" folks are also sending Amber death threats! What?? That is autocratic (and cowardly) behavior. If you have't read Animal Farm read it. Bc there are secret liberal groups whose sole mission is to \"expose\" racists. Again-- worthy and necessary-- BUT WHY SECRET. And there are secret white supremacist groups targeting gay people-- IN SECRET! COWARDS ALL. \n\nI am reevaluating my tactics because if you are spending your day (listening Karen?) getting your phone ready to capture some drama you instigated to then use the interaction to call the cops-- regardless of the issue- YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.\n\nToday I parked across the street from my brother\"s house and a woman who had not been there previously was waiting in her car to harass me for \"parking in front of her house\". Huh? It's a fucking public street lady! She like others want everyone to know they are \"watching\" you and their rights are superior. That is psycho. So when cops act like Karens and keep a mom from doing what she was born to do-- protect kids-- we all need to stand up and say ENOUGH.\n\nNO DUE PROCESS, NO JUSTICE, NO JUSTICE NO PEACE. NO DUE PROCESS NO PEACE IT IS TRANSITIVE FOLKS\n\nG-D BLESS US ALL!!!",

Because your logic is all over the place and troubling in a way that it sounds like you just dont have full grasp on the world yet.\n\nLet's just focus on \"someone with absolutely nothing was more willing to just run in there than trained professionals\" That was a mother of two children in the school. She had her children to loose which for most parents is everything to them. The cops were the ones with nothing to loose and because they didnt they did nothing because they had nothing at stake.\n\nAlso the naivety to think cops didnt want her talking because of some kind of public safety concern adds to the look that you have a 1 as the first digit in your age. Those cops dont care about the general public's safety as has been demonstrated. They care about their own well being and safety, as was demonstrated. Also the idea flies in the face of the whole \"good guy with a gun\" thing. The fact is cops generally wont do anything to protect people (worldly experiences have taught me that first hand) and it's up to you to protect yourself and others as is the same for everyone else in your community. You now know the cops wont do shit when it hits the fans but also say that individuals shouldnt risk their own lives to protect the people the cops arent protecting. \n\nIt sucks that this is all the case, but you need to live a little more in the real world.",

But whenever a cop does something really horrible, even if it was just one cop and most other cops are horrified by it, it gets all over the news. \n\nTechnically both stories are true, the cops DID go in and did their job, but the woman also helped, and while what happened afterwards about suing the woman is probably true and a clear example of a bad cop, trying to stop the woman from entering the building makes sense, as it is standard police protocol.",
