So even if one died or became too powerful, the light side would easily be able to meet or beat it.\n\nBut the Jedi...

Which is fine, I guess, because it opens the door for people who don't naturally dance well, but it is awkward to watch.\n\nEdit- of course \"bad dancing\" is totally subjective and I think everyone should dance no matter what. The awkward part is watching people look uncomfortable with what they are doing.",

The CEO has a pretty small stake, and vanguard is among numerous mutual funds to have a meaningful stake. Then who owns Vanguard? \"Nobody knows because that's private information.\" \n\nVanguard is owned by the vanguard mutual funds.\n\nI could dissect the whole video because she is basically wrong or misleading with every sentence but it would take forever, that's what's annoying about this video.\n\nVanguard is large primarily for providing individual investors a way to track the S&P 500 with very low fees. Now people who want to invest don't have to get robbed by mutual fund managers that quite often don't even match the S&P before they take fees. \n\nIt's no shock that as people invest in these funds, and as the fund buys more shares in those companies to keep tracking the S&P, it will come to own a significant share of all of the biggest corporations in the US.",

Smaller businesses also have the advantage of lots of unique viewpoints, a better connection to the people and less bureaucracy.  \n\nAnd cars have been continuously getting more efficient over time, even with the original combustion engine.

If the old thing works then there\u2019s no real need to change it much. Bikes and trains are some of the most efficient modes of transport around and they were invented in the Victorian era. They\u2019re also being massively improved so that they look vastly different to their old ways.  \n\nSometimes you need to dramatically change things, and sometimes you just need to tweak what already exists.

There is some interesting stuff with Blackrock (they seem to be the basis for part of Westworld with the Aladdin software) but there isn't a sinister group making secret plans. Vanguard's managers just care how there balance sheet is doing so they can get a bonus. This is like betting on both horses in a two horse race. There isn't a secret scheme, its more insidious.\n\nYou don't need to have a conspiracy if everyone already agrees and knows what to do on their own. The top executives pretty much go through the same Education and jobs. You want to be a CEO of a big company, go to one of a handful of schools where they will teach you to think a a very specific way and work in finance or marketing (a few have some sort of engineering background).  You get filtered out if you don't have a fairly narrow perspective on corporate interests, consumers, personal private property, government. If you don't match, you can be an entrepreneur but you aren't going to be CEO of an established company. \n\nOnce you are in the club, you set the pay for your buddies and they set your pay (a number of studies note this is why US Executive pay is so much higher). You and everyone else in the club, game the system to maximize personal reward. Limiting competition is usually in the interest of big companies to maximize profits, so you do that in a variety of ways while you push down costs (worker wages, regulations, etc) and have some pet projects to make the analysts want to say your stock is more valuable. If a disruptor comes along, buy it. Everyone is happy except for workers, consumers, etc.\n\nSidenote/ caveat, Koch and a few others do have a nefarious plans but their businesses are private.",

One key characteristic of banks is that they offer their customers the opportunity to open checking accounts, thus creating checkable deposits.

I gave a clear example of not every person participating and Capitalism not just not caring but turning it into a commodity.

Even at the city council level I'm still voting with all the other people in my area.\n\nThat's how voting works.\n\nBut when you own your shares as part of a managed fund, you (and everyone else) lose your vote completely and the company that manages the fund gets to vote how they want. As others have pointed out, these two firms probably are mostly just rubber-stamping board of director decisions, but it's still a loss of control for all those shareholders.",

What's more, they dilute market pressure on corps to perform - a company that underperformed historically would have big funds selling which would impact the ceo- whereas passive investing in index funds means those shares will be held until they're delighted even if they go thru years of mismanagement and underperformance.",

A big difference either way means the fund was mismanaged. \n\nIf it's something like the Wellington fund, then Yes it has discretion on what to hold and what portion since it's an actively managed fund. But still they need to be careful not to trigger capital gains issues for the investor. \n\nSource: I used to work for Vanguard and held a series 6 and 63.",

What they are looking into doing is basically allowing the ultimate shareholders the ability to use their proportional ownership to vote on shareholder matters. Before, you had to own the shares directly in order to vote, not in an index fund. But now, even if you own them through a fund, you can vote. At least, that's how I've understood it.",

The ownership levels of Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft will be higher because they are the largest companies and the funds are valuation weighted.\n\nWhen you own a fund from BlackRock or Vanguard, you pay them a very tiny fee (0.03-0.04% usually, though \u201cfancier\u201d funds can have larger expense ratios). \n\nSo the right way to think of this is that Vanguard CUSTOMERS own 7.83% of Apple. Vanguard themselves may have equity in Apple, but it damn sure isn\u2019t 7.83%.\n\nEDIT: BlackRock also holds investments of their own, Vanguard (from what I can tell) does not.

BlackRock is another 6% owner of Apple, Inc., while State Street owns just under 5%. For the most valuable public company in the world, three individuals can in principle swing the vote of 17% of its shares. Generally, a significant fraction of shareholders do not vote, even if in contested battles. As a result, the 17% actually represents more like 25% or more of the likely votes in contested votes. That share of the vote will generally be pivotal. Add another few funds, and the votes of other funds that follow the advice of proxy advisory firms such as ISS and Glass-Lewis, and the collective vote of the group of index funds will almost always include the median vote in such fights. Hence, the Problem of Twelve.\"",

A cofounder/director of blackrock has a seat and she speaks for herself, not blackrock. It's incredibly common for successful people in other industries to go on board of directors for other companies. For example, Alex Gorsky, chairman of Johnson and Johnson, has a seat on Apple's board, and you probably wouldn't say Johnson and Johnson has a seat. Also, Al Gore is on apple's board and you probably wouldn't say the white house or the democratic party has a seat.",

There are also expenses that are charged to LPs.\n\nPE fund life is a standard ten year with option to extend, usually up to a couple more years. The investment window is usually something like 3 years or so. It is in the interest of the GP to invest all subscriber money pledged. Uninvested money gets no fees, etc. \n\nIf the investment does well, it will payback the investment principle, management fees, 8% gain and then enter a period of true-up where profits are split between GP and LP. \n\nThe standard carry is 80 (LP)/20(GP).\n\nIf the investment fails, it goes into clawback where money taken from the sale of a company is used to pay back a certain amount of fees and expenses to the LP.\n\nTL;DR: in private equity investments, management companies own a small percentage of the investment but can take as much as 20% of the profit.",

It just mimics what the S&P 500 does, so the largest is Apple, then Microsoft, then Alphabet, then Amazon, and on and on. I\u2019m not 100% sure how often it rebalances but it\u2019s very frequently and it has nothing to do with where BlackRock wants the money to go.\n\nNow it gets a little complicated because BlackRock also does other types of management and investing.

He actively fought the wall street shitheads, and he could have made a shit load more money if he was one. He died around 90 years old with a net worth of $80M, which is quite a bit of money, but it\u2019s not as much as it seems for a 90 year old who invests their money wisely over their lifetime. Play around with a compound interest calculator yielding 10% for 70 years and you\u2019d be surprised how little money can turn into $80M.",

Blackrock and those guys don't want to hear complaints and stuff based on how they vote, so now that its more technologically possible they want to put it back on their own clients.   \n\n\nRemember too that they also hold funds in many different funds and those may also all vote separately.   \nThey also then will have other funds where they might short those same stocks.   \n\n\nSo really Blackrock etc.. may not even care if a stock goes up or down, only the individual funds care. Especially for ETFs, their job is just to mirror indexes, not to make or lose money so they don't want to influence the index, just mirror it.",

Maybe they are voting for profit and finally decided new energy is cheaper in the long run than relying on foreign oil reserves. Or maybe they feared losing power if they kept screwing people over on every vote and threw them a bone on climate change, so the can keep control of what really matters to them\u2013maximizing profit through rising consumer prices and stagnant wages.

The point is, it was votes controlled by funds that shifted the decision making, not whether the decision was a good one.\n\n It's weird there is a whole thread mocking this lady for here economic theory and not her dancing.

Below is an excerpt, maybe you can tell me how this isn't the issue being discussed. \n\nAnd how much proxy voting do you actually thinks happens, because it isn't much and what does exist only happened recently because of criticisms like these and still only applies to large institutional investors, not the consumers being screwed by price collusion? \n\nWhat fiduciary responsibility, the one to maximize profits, because that is the only one I know of and it is part of the problem? \n\nAnd if this isn't an issue why are BlackRock and Vanguard lobbying so hard against proposals to ban then voting shares they hold for investors? \n\nYou sound like a BlackRock flak [writing](https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-proxy-voting-capitalism-larry-fink-exxon-munger-esg-climate-11645570950) into the Wall Street Journal to complain Charles Munger called them out on this issue.  If even Charles Munger [thinks](https://www.wsj.com/articles/charlie-munger-expects-index-funds-to-change-the-worldand-not-in-a-good-way-11645055334) you've gone to far making money, maybe there is something to it.   \n\nRelevant Excerpt:\n\n\"In the banking industry, the top four shareholders of JPMorganChase (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, and Fidelity) were also the top four shareholders of Bank of America and four of the top six shareholders of Citigroup, collectively holding 19.2% of JPMorganChase, 16.9% of Bank of America, and 21.9% of Citigroup. Another new econometric study finds that such horizontal shareholdings have significantly increased the fees that banks charge and decreased the deposit rates that banks pay.\n\nThese same shareholders were also the top four shareholders of Apple and four of the top six shareholders of Apple\u2019s main rival,Microsoft. These four horizontal shareholders collectively owned 18.4% of Apple and 17.3% of Microsoft. In the pharmacy market, the top five shareholders of CVS (the aforementioned four plus Wellington) were also the top five shareholders of its main rival Walgreens. These horizontal shareholders owned 24.6% of CVS and 19.6% of Walgreens.\n\nThere is every reason to think that the problem of horizontal shareholding is pervasive across our economy because institutional investors like BlackRock, Vanguard, Fidelity, and State Street now own around 80% of all stock in S&P 500 corporations. These institutional investors also offer index funds that cover all industries and sector funds in each specific industry, so most industries likely have significant horizontal shareholdings. Even though individual money managers at each institutional investor may manage smaller portfolios, institutional investors usually exercise the shareholder voting rights of all their funds jointly at the fund-family level in order to maximize each institutional investor\u2019s influence on corporate governance.\n\nEconomic theory has long shown that horizontal shareholdings can reduce the incentives of horizontal competitors to compete with each other. The reason is that firms maximize profits by competing only when the profits from taking market share away from other firms exceed the interest in keeping marketwide prices high. In competitive markets where ownership is separate, economic models prove that firms have incentives to undercut each others\u2019 prices because the profits they gain from the additional sales exceed the price reduction caused by their own conduct. Because each firm sets prices based on the same calculus, they keep undercutting each other until they drive down prices toward marginal cost, which is the most efficient level.But the standard economic model of market competition assumes that when a firm takes away sales by undercutting its rivals\u2019 prices,the firm\u2019s owners gain the profits from those sales but lose no profit onthe sales taken away from their rivals. When the owners of a firm alsoown that firm\u2019s rivals, the calculus is entirely different. This is easiestto see when the owners of a firm are identical to the owners of thatfirm\u2019s rival. In that case, when a firm undercuts its rival\u2019s price totake away a sale, the movement of the sale to the firm from the rivalsimply moves their owners\u2019 money from one pocket to another; the neteffect of the price cut for those owners is that the prices charged byboth firms are lower, thus lowering those owners\u2019 profits across bothfirms. Suppose, for example, that there are only two restaurants intown that are separately incorporated but both owned by the sameperson. What incentive would one restaurant have to undercut theprice of the other restaurant to take away its business? None \u2014 because it is taking away business from the same person who owns it.\n\nThis anticompetitive incentive is similar, though somewhat attenuated, when the shareholders of two firms are only partially overlapping. Suppose one firm\u2019s shareholders also own 50% of that firm\u2019s rival. Now, the firm\u2019s shareholders will gain some profits by moving a sale from the rival to the firm, but less profits than if their shareholders were entirely different. Instead, a firm acting on behalf of its shareholders will realize that each sale gained by the firm costs thefirm\u2019s owners not only the usual marginal cost of making the product,but also 50% of the profits that the rival loses by having the sale takenaway. The effect on firm pricing incentives is the same as if its marginal cost for expanding output were increased by an amount equal tohalf the profits the rival loses by losing a sale. Like any increase in afirm\u2019s marginal costs, this effect reduces the incentives of each firm toprice products lower \u2014 even if their respective managers never communicate or coordinate with each other. \"",

I not only have received countless proxy materials as a shareholder myself, but I\u2019ve personally walked people through what they mean, because I\u2019m a professional financial advisor. \n\nIf you think that fiduciary responsibility extends literally only to maximizing profits to shareholders, you grossly misunderstand the concept. \n\nYou can copy paste the entire PDF if you want, it seems like you\u2019ll still be no closer to understanding the difference between horizontal shareholding (an actual, serious issue) and the Illuminati garbage that dancing pudding for brains was ranting about in the video. When these asset managers have ownership in several different competing companies in a sector, the concern is a disincentive to foster competition in that sector. It\u2019s not something done nefariously, funds invest in companies and their competitors as a form of diversification to mitigate company specific risk in the market. The disincentive is a side effect of smart asset management, not the goal. \n\nSeriously, you might be worse than the video girl",

Economic models show that substantial horizontal shareholdings are likely to anticompetitively raise prices when the owned businesses compete in a concentrated market. Recent empirical work not only confirms this prediction, but also reveals that such horizontal shareholdings are omnipresent in our economy\"\n\nThat's from the abstract, it goes on like that for 51 pages without once mentioning the illuminati.

Makes sense why we would have to top yearly profits with greed for more more more when their working for stocks and share holders. She's got some things on the nose. She maybe wrong about a few things. But again would you put it past human capacity to not be greedy and for these rich owners to pay off whom ever they want? Look at what's happening between Sony and Microsoft with Microsoft being borderline anti trust and monopoly while it's allowed. \n\nI wouldn't doubt at one point someone could buy the world off and own it all and that the courts wouldn't allow it. \nElon Musk literally has enough profits to buy 25 of everything in the world. And these people even with an infinite number as enforced by something to always beat their profits and act illegally as well as enforced by policy and law and rounding clocks for a reason. Slavery is still a big thing and if we didn't wage slave these fat greedy pigs wouldn't exist but you wouldn't be able to buy your special stuff you want like TVs and Cell phones. Look at how Amazon treats their employees and Jeff bezos is no different from Elon Musk they have the power to end world hunger and almost enough to give literally each person on the planet a free home mortgage free. Do they care though? Nope. Never will. Just like the monopoly law won't ever apply to the very few and if it does they'll just pay it.",

Vanguard and Blackrock combined hold about 14% of Class A shares in Alphabet and about 13% of (nonvoting) Class C shares.

Writing a whole lot in about economics and offering cherry picked math in a vacuum does not mean the language is correctly describing anything.\n\nSee here about the possibility that the problems with QM are derived from our language: https://nautil.us/i-just-want-to-know-what-im-made-of-14367/\n\n\"Choose your own adventure\" research is all there is. What matters is determining if the conclusion has real effects or if they're mitigated by other conclusions. Monopoly ownership has real effects. Why enable middlemen in the form of Vanguard and Black Rock? Why can't I just buy stock from Apple or wherever? \n\nThere is a whole lot of grift due to buy into to the sunk cost fallacy, where the behavior of the past must be sacrosanct or reality implodes. I think <50% of the US believing in a God now shows that's bullshit. The same is true for economic beliefs. A model of economic truth in contemporary US is not a physical truth, it's a political one.

Shes definitely confident, and there are things she's said that, on the surface, are incorrect.\n\nThat being said, it's fucked up that these investment firms (I don't know that I'd call them \"corporations\", I feel like that has slightly different connotations) have their fingers in the pot of SO MANY of the world's most powerful corporate entities. I don't know if they're lifting up these businesses when they're smaller (like angel investors?) or if they're shaking them down because they're the king makers because they throw so much money at these guys, or if they have ALL the connections and they're using their power in other ways in exchange for huge stock %s, but obviously something shady is going on.  \n\n\nDisclaimer: I'm pretty high right now, so hopefully this all makes sense.

Wheren they can just \"print\" them and their buddies money and distribute through quatatative easing and inflation.\n\nIn a true free market you would have competing currencies and nothing would be forced upon you. In America one bad policy from the FED from central planning can lead to years of economic downturn. The fed creates the boom and busts. Where the rich and powerful can make the right plays and normal people get the shaft.\n\nI stand by my argument that competition is to stiff in free market to harbor a corporation or monopoly. In fact government is the monopoly. Other free market solutions to giant powerful companies are unions. It is only when unions lay In bed with government do they gain unbalanced power and become corrupted. Think about it, an individual or even a group of individuals have no power, but when they can use \"law\" to their benefit then the ultimate consequence for dissenters is death.\n\nEconomy's recover from downturn all the time. I think if the state was to truly disappear you would see the fastest recovery in history, since money flows where it is needed, unrestricted and uncensored.\n\nUltimately I think it is a loss to blame capitalism when the problem in front of your eyes is indeed \"corporatism\" or \"crony capitalism.\"",

Take energy for instance. More wars have been waged over oil in the last 100 years than any other resource. Imagine putting BP and ExxonMobil out of commission through a sheer decentralized power grid ran on solar or other techniques. Generate all your electricity yourself and if you have excess sell back to the overall grid to parties who are energy deficient. Not only is this system more reliable, robust, and better for the planet, it is achieved without violent force since their is no real incentive to steal here or wage war. This could be done all peer to peer mind you with no centralized system in place. So more decentralization, autonomy, and education is my answer. This is already where the market is trying to go, but big government is tied in with oil very deeply. As a society at large we should be conscious of civil rights, liberty, and humanitarianism. That won't happen through the barrel of a gun at the hand of the state.",

If oil were unprofitable tomorrow, ExxonMobil (or the people running ExxonMobil) would immediately move their vast financial wealth into controlling some other resource. \n\nWe both agree that power is pooled to extremely into, what you would call a crony and what I would call a capitalists, hands. How do you wrest control of those resources out of their hands? Education and protecting your property isn't going to make Jeff Bezos not a billionaire. The people who ran the Texas (or any) power grid are not simply going to give up their monopoly ans you can't just expect enough people to buy into solar or wind, individually.",

I'm not nitpicking out minor details here, at least half of what she says is incorrect in one way or another. \n\nAlso \"young people\" is not a generation. I don't know her exact age, but I'd guess she's only a couple years younger than me.

You just put all your money into it and let it sit around in a volatile market, magically you'll become billionaire just like that.

There was a time when it was possible to work an average paying job that offered good benefits and a retirement plan while also building savings to invest on top of that.   When you could basically work the same job for most of your life and retire at a decent age with a rather large nest egg.\n\nThat time is long passed and basically died with the last millennium.  The .com bubble set up the last of the dominos and its bursting began the collapse.  Many people who were  half way through their careers took massive hits...followed by 9/11 and the subsequent wars.\n\nThe price of education was shooting through the roof...technology changing the work environment.... corporations outsourcing production to countries with cheap labor... and all the while underneath it all the housing crisis was bubbling finally resulting in the financial crisis of 08'.\n\nSeriously imagine if you had been in your late 40s to mid 50s   when the .com bubble burst... you'd have spent the next 8 years barely starting to recover after seeing your savings wiped out only to see all of that wiped out again right b4 retirement.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of 08' I'd like to address something from a different comment you made.  Basically you were railing against BlackRock  controlling all this money and just doing whatever they want with it.... but that's not what BlackRock is.\n\nWho you should really be directing your attacks toward are the Wallstreet investment banks.  Think JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs,   Morgan Stanley, Citi group ect...\n\nIt's regular ass banks that can do absolutely whatever they want with your money and you get *nothing* in return.\n\nBlackrock is an asset management company.  You buy into their investment products.  You don't give your money directly to Blackrock like you do with your regular bank account.\n\nYou're points are not necessarily wrong.  They are just misdirected.",

I mean the whole point is to have experts in there doing it for you to make the most profit, so that's not to be criticial of. \n\n*However* the sheer fact that Vanguard has 7 trillion sitting in their investment firm, and the fact that they make the majority of decisions in which companies are traded, gives them immense control of the market. So to say investment firms have a worrisome amount of control over economy is not wrong. It's sort of like how banks have a ridiculous amount of power because they control so much debt. Simply having that much money in your possession, even if you are holding it on behalf of another entity, is where real economic power is. *Especially* if you have the ability to move it around at your whim. That's the point I am trying to make.",

No discretionary decisions are really made as to what to invest in outside of trying to maintain the representation of an index. \n\nAs for the voting discussion rights this has become a popular talking point recently and is in the passive investing world there are some potential new innovations coming to allow for fund holders to be able to cast votes.\n\nIn practice. the vast majority of cases the funds typically just vote with majority decision anyway.  I do feel as if saying \u201cthey make the majority of these companies decisions\u201d is largely unfounded. \n\nThey are again ,passive funds. If they are throwing around their weight at every chance to sway the company then they really just becoming active managers. \n\nActive management costs a lot of money and therefore would require higher fees. The whole point of these funds is to diversify and reduce fees for the average investor. The alternative is to build you own 500+ portfolio, rebalance yourself periodically, and then look through thousands of pages of voting decisions for the companies and put in your vote individually each. Oh And also file taxes yourself.\n\nI could be totally wrong and/or missing the point but I am not sure you understand exactly the passive investing business that vanguard and black rock are in.",

You don't think that gives them a sizeable amount of influence over publicly traded companies? If you know that Vanguard has a billion dollars in a specific company that they actively manage, it's not unreasonable to conclude that those companies would be compelled to act in the favor of Vanguard. That's why I'm saying in a sense it's not wrong to conclude that the largest 3 investment firms have influence over the entire market since they manage 82% of it.\n\nhttps://www.thinkadvisor.com/2020/11/30/group-aims-to-limit-power-of-blackrock-vanguard-state-street/\n\nhttps://www.economicliberties.us/our-work/new-money-trust/",

Certainly there are many times when that power doesn't get exercised in a manner this girl describes, but it would be naive to think that people with central authoritarian goals wouldn't put themselves in such a position to take advantage of this.",

Most require a net worth of a million to even invest in because they are so unregulated and the commissions are insane. Vanguard blackrock and fidelity are not in the hedge fund business.\n\nThese aren't new ideas that millennials came up with. The SEC has thought of this stuff.

That said, there are a lot of confounding factors - 1) Blackrock (I am unsure about Vanguard) has been moving in recent years to let their ETF customers provide input and vote by proxy which negates some of that undue influence 2) while point 1 is true, Joe Schmoe retail investor in an ETF doesn't matter all that much and only large institutional owners of their ETFs are given the option to vote by proxy 3) if Blackrock lends out their shares (which is a big business for them) they lose the ability to vote so ETF/mutual fund customers *can't* vote even by proxy as Blackrock/Vanguard gave up that right when they lent the shares out",

Intended by who?\n\nThere can be, and are, conspiracies, especially among holders of wealth. The Koch network is an example of a conspiracy. However, the interests of the capitalist class are generally not pursued by plan - at least, not among the class as a whole. The class as a whole pursues its interests. It doesn't exactly make intelligent decisions - the sum of its members' decisions add up to its actions. The disproportionate power wielded by this group means that its members succeed more often than its opponents. Its \"intent\" is carried out in this way without clear causality.\n\nThe fact that 401ks help obscure class lines was undoubtedly realized by some political operatives and members of the capitalist class, but probably not by most and may or may not have been an explicitly realized factor in the planning of the policymakers who promoted it. There were many factors that made this move attractive to the capitalist class, and the obscuring nature just added a bit of sort of statistical pressure, making it more attractive to that class in general.",

So in that way, yes, Vanguard has little direction or choice about what to buy and is more or less passively transferring profits/dividends from the companies in the S&P 500 index to me. If they weren\u2019t then VOO would not track the SP500s performance almost exactly (net of their small fee).\n\nI don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re saying they do? I\u2019m willing to guess almost all of their lobbying was not around corporate governance or company policy stuff that would affect peoples lives, but around regulation aimed at making their business easier (selling funds).",

I\u2019m not sure what if anything you\u2019re basing your intuition off of. Other industry groups and individual companies spend more but Vanguard is certainly getting influence for that money \u2014 that\u2019s why they\u2019re spending it. \n\nAnd Yes, I understand how index investing works, thank you. I\u2019m not talking about allocating funds. I\u2019m talking about what it means when your company has 7 trillion spread around in virtually every company worth owning. \n\nUnlike you and me and everyone else who owns $VOO, Vanguard itself actually has shareholder rights in these companies and exercises them to influence how they\u2019re run. They have a big page on their website: (https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/how-we-advocate/investment-stewardship/index.html) And \u201cVanguard\u201d isn\u2019t some abstract intelligence: when I say it exercises them I mean its executive leaders do \u2014 extremely powerful individuals with their own ideas about the world and goals. \n\nNow I\u2019m not going to let you lose track of the ball here: the OP comment you were replying to said that individual investors gave all the money to Vanguard so it\u2019s its actually just individual investors who collectively have $7 trillion of influence in the world. And my point is that\u2019s not the case and that this fundamentally misunderstands what ETFs are. Vanguard buys shares in companies according to the index but its leadership team and its own largest stakeholders are who get to decide how to use the influence those shares entitle one to. \n\nAnd more than that we\u2019re just talking about Vanguard. All the things I\u2019ve been saying (and even most of the things you\u2019ve incorrectly imagined me to be saying) are more true for Blackrock, which is even fucking bigger.",

                      "text": "But \"all else\" isn't necessarily equal, because we have a data point: at the very least I think it's obvious that she's doing the unnatural dance and outfit to get more views. Clearly the speech was well rehearsed (as opposed to being a rambling one of a passionate person speaking impromptu), which demonstrates an important factor from the get go: *intent.*\n\n  \nIf the topic of the video was important enough to her for her to practice, strange dancing and informality aside, an otherwise excellent and easy to understand presentation, then it follows that the only other substantial part of the video -- the dance -- was deliberate as well. Sure, it is possible that she truly thought that the dance was good and has an astonishing lack of social graces that she is unable to realize the how strange it would look. But though many people have odd quirks or can be socially oblivious, a thing that is a lot rarer for people to lack is the ingrained tendency to want to act serious when trying to convey serious thoughts, versus acting casual when what you are conveying is either not very serious in nature, or not terribly important. This is just common human behavior; if you feel strongly about something you tend to want to act in a way that will make others take your words on that particular topic to heart. I think this is more likely.\n  \n  \n  \nFrom there, we can apply logic and educated guessing. She clearly intended both the speech and the dance, and it is unlikely that she is so socially inept that she did the dance for fun, given the context. If we accept that, then we can make a fairly safe guess that, given what the average person knows about the internet and viral videos (which is probably a higher percent of her age group), the reason for the dance is to make her content stand out to people and get people talking about it, which has clearly worked.\n\n  \n  \nThough I've written a lot (I just like to be thorough in my explanation) the reasoning is quite straightforward and requires no unlikely or unreliable factors. Given all this, then, what can we conclude? We can conclude that it is likely that this woman *is* clever enough to take a hit to her dignity in order to get her message out there. It's hardly a Machiavellian scheme, after all we figured it out in a couple short steps.\n  \n \n  \nGiven that, we suddenly see that Occam's razor shouldn't necessarily inform our preference anymore, because the \"all else being equal\" (which, in this case, was the fact that we don't have any background information on this clip), is suddenly not true: we have data and context that we can safely infer from the content and metacontent of the video. *Now*, our possible explanations become a choice between:\n  \n  \n\n  \nA) \"This woman, who we can reasonably conclude is already clever enough to manipulate social media to spark discussion, is also way oversimplifying her argument to the point of invalidity in order to promote *further* discussion and critical thinking\"\n  \nor\n\n  \nB) \" this woman is showing misinformation because she doesn't know what she's talking about and isn't particularly bright\"\n\n  \n  \n \nI would say that the answer becomes much less clear at this point. Given what we've inferred about her, option A isn't at all unreasonable, and if it were the case it seems to be working. Of course, that doesn't preclude option B from being incorrect per se (although I would contend against the \"not very bright\" part.) Both can be true, and she could still be woefully incorrect, oversimplifying too much, or partially incorrect in some conclusions she draws from correct data, or any mix of the above.\n  \nI don't mean to dismiss your point, because it certainly is possible, but Occam's razor is valid if you are *careful* with it, and consider every part of its definition. It isn't supposed to be an argumentative crutch, but rather a vehicle for inspection, which is what I believe the other replier was trying to get across in more..*strong* terms.",

But I think, given the context, it is an indication of cleverness, even if you don't believe that she might be clever all the time (but does one need to be clever all the time to be capable of clever things?).\n  \nWould you mind explaining your 2nd and 3rd points further? I think it's a bit of a strawman to call it \"4D chess\" as that lends it more weight than it really demands, in my opinion. Terminology aside though, how did you come to that conclusion?\n  \nTo be clear, I'm not stating that I believe that is her intention, but that to deny it as a very legitimate possibility out of hand is a bit rash. Certainly she's not educated people on economics in the way she might appear to have intended to, but *other* people in this section certainly have. Is that not more effective? Many of people who normally might not put much thought into it and accept her arguments at face value will dismiss her arguments because of how ridiculous she looks and sounds, so that mitigates some of the dangers of misinformation. At the same time, many brave commenters here are rushing to support her general stance but with better data, analysis, and in written format, which few would have read otherwise, even if they had existed. I would say in this case then that her video definitely resulted in her general message being conveyed in a supported manner to many more people than it otherwise may have been. I don't think, given what we've reasoned before, that it is unreasonable to think about the intent behind it. Information and media are very powerful tools.",

You keep tossing this fact out there like its some kind of \u201cgotcha,\u201d but we already knew you don\u2019t get to vote directly.  That\u2019s quite literally what voting by proxy means.

If I didn\u2019t trust my broker, I\u2019d be far more concerned about bad investments than in corporate governance bullshit.\n\nBut let\u2019s pretend corporate governance is the big issue here.  If Vanguard violates their prospectus and votes however the fuck they want, ignoring your proxy votes, they can land in hot water with the SEC.  There could be fines, they could lose their charter, and keep personnel could even go to jail for securities fraud.  \n\nSo, applying Occam\u2019s razor, does it seem more likely that\n1) Vanguard is secretly giving the SEC the finger and is the real shadow ruler behind the scenes, or\n2) this is just a far out there conspiracy theory?\n\nEdit: Ah, the unending quest for more sources!

All I've maintained is that vanguard weilds substantial influence over many companies by right of their index fund holdings and associated investor votes.  It doesn't seem like there is any disagreement here.\n\nYou describe proxy voting like they vote the way I want them to somehow.  But my only vote, as you say, is whether or not I buy their fund.  And then potentially again related to vanguard investor votes like elections. Beyond that, vanguard votes my shares according to their principles, not mine.  It would be impossible to vote the principles of their heterogeneous investor base.  They vote their shares in one block.  This is fundamentally different than the way voting would work if I held those shares directly.  It allows vanguard a significant voice they would not have if they were a brokerage holding investments on my behalf.\n\nConvenient to not cite sources in response to sources I provide.  I agree the discussion is over.",

More recently, entities like Vanguard, Blackrock, StateStreet and other giants have been taking a more active role in voting those proxies, and they usually will publish why they\u2019re voting the way they are. \n\nJust last year for example, they helped stage a coup on the board of Exxon:\n\nhttps://www.thinkadvisor.com/2021/05/27/blackrock-and-vanguard-played-key-roles-in-exxons-shareholder-proxy-vote/?amp=1\n\n> The two fund giants, which together own approximately 14% of ExxonMobil shares, according to reports, supported portions of a dissident slate of board nominees brought by a Engine No. 1, an activist, purpose-driven investment firm that sees ExxonMobil\u2019s response to the global climate crisis as far too weak to help achieve net zero emissions by 2050, putting shareholder value at risk.\n\nVanguard also published a detailed white paper on how they voted and why:\n\nhttps://global.vanguard.com/documents/voting-insights-exxon.pdf\n\nI\u2019m tired of seeing people attribute something to be a big mysterious conspiracy when the reality is they didn\u2019t bother to spend 60 seconds to look it up. Every public company they invest in, every proxy they vote in, it\u2019s all public information. We don\u2019t have to act like it\u2019s some big secret.

And with such a whole huge hedge fund of money they can do things that are absolutely nuts, when you have a huge lump of money that's equal to more than the cash in circulation there's a lot of insane things that are possible and not good for society. Anything is on the table to maximize their bottom line. They can silently encourage price fixing, price gouging, they could short stocks, they are majority shareholders in so many businesses that they can discourage competition to form an oligarchical cartel. They get to decide whether or not wars are profitable and if they are, you better believe there's gonna be war. My point about them liquidating into cash was If they wanted to change their assets into gold or Bitcoin, or another currency and they felt this was a profitable decision, they could most certainly do that, and they could buy so much of it that it would make the remaining supply very very low. They can monopolize anything they want at any time and the only thing stopping them is the FTC shaking his finger at them, but the ftc can be bribed too, in politics they call it lobbying. any one nation's policies mean very little to them. Any one investor's moral compass means very little to them. There is an unfathomable amount of power this group has, and even though it's grandma's money it's not like grandma's gonna stop them, even if a bunch of grandmas don't like what they're doing and want to cash out their investment, then we got a stock market crash on our hands and we just give government bail outs to these investment companies again, and it's still just business as usual.",

The US stock market is around $93.7tn total market cap ([https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD?end=2020&most\\_recent\\_value\\_desc=true&start=1975](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.CD?end=2020&most_recent_value_desc=true&start=1975)) meaning that Blackrock/Vanguard own AT BEST 18% of the market.  \n\nOnce you extrapolate for non-listed companies, non-equity assets and the massive foreign market, they're not close to owning everything.  To be clear, Vanguard and Blackrock own a lot of the market but not everything.  Also, I happen to like Vanguard because they explicitly help people skip elite/exclusive investment advisors so average people can invest and retire.  That further distances from her \"global cabal\" argument IMO.",

They\u2019re popular because they go with a song people like, and kids tend to watch them a lot. Kids don\u2019t care about who owns what, regardless of the dance.",

I prefer to stick to facts.\n\n\n\n>White people also claim they don't have a culture\n\nNo of course they don't.  Just like there isn't black culture etc. There is white American culture, British white culture and so on. But a uniform culture that all white peop\u00e6e globally identifies with? No such thing exists. But it might be used as an umbrella term to encompass all cultures originating from historically white countries. And if that is the case, then that without a doubt is the most influential culture in the entire world.\n\nIt has been so influential that other cultures have adopted so much from them, that they think it's products of their own culture.",

Lol\n\n>I'm sure that's a concept you struggle with in Europe\n\nNot at all.

Vanguard is almost never the subject of these conspiracy theories because everyone in the industry knows they\u2019re the \u201cgood guys\u201d. Their whole thing is bringing down Wall St and making the benefits of investing previously reserved for the rich and connected available now for the general public. Democratizing investing so that everyone can participate and have a piece of the pie, lowering fees to squeeze Wall St and their margins and reduce how much fees they can extract from the general public. And then Vanguard gives all its profits back to their investors because they\u2019re owned by their funds which are owned by their customers. \n\nVanguard is everything that Wall st hates. They don\u2019t have billionaire executives, they don\u2019t charge ludicrous fees, they are purpose built to not have any incentive to participate in most of the shenanigans that Wall St gets up to that causes so many problems. They\u2019re not perfect, by any means, but they are at the forefront (the vanguard, if you will) of the fight against Wall St and their predatory practices.\n\nIt\u2019s like hating on Tesla just because they\u2019re the biggest car company by market cap right now and saying they must be the most evil car company and they\u2019re probably behind all the environmental problems in the world today. Tesla is not a perfect company but them being the biggest car company doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a problem. They\u2019re the ones that are responsible in large part for the electric car revolution occurring today that is actually having immense positive impact on the environment overall (on net). \n\nSomeone who goes in and tries to outcompete the bad actors with a more ethical business model and actually finds success should be applauded, not disparaged. \n\nIn the case of investing, Vanguard is one of the best potential allies for people who want to unseat Wall St and the mega-rich from their seats of power. Their biggest problem is how scared and squeamish they\u2019ve been about wielding the power they have in order to enact change. For years when it came time for proxy votes they\u2019d just vote with management or abstain. It\u2019s only been somewhat recently that they\u2019ve become more active and pushed for changes at major companies. \n\nFor example, Blackrock and Vanguard teamed up last year to stage a coup on Exxon\u2019s board and successfully put two people on the board that were explicitly planning to push Exxon to do more to lower their environmental impact. I want to see more of that.",

If you invest in a S&P500 index fund, the contents of that fund will be all the companies in the S&P500, and the proportions will be according to relative value within the index. That money that\u2019s invested is *managed* by Vanguard and Blackrock, but the assets are actually owned by whoever put their money in Vanguard or BlackRock funds: private investors, pension companies\u2026\n\nAnd this is how Vanguard can manage assets of both Coca-Cola AND Pepsi, without it meaning a thing. If a company falls out of an index, Vanguard/Blackrock would automatically divest from it. Why would they do that if they were schemeing something by owning \u201dcompeting brands\u201d.\n\nEdit: This Redditor explained it even better:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/confidentlyincorrect/comments/ta7v29/someone_doesnt_know_how_finances_work/i00g5yv/",

                      "text": "You\u2019re misinterpreting what those numbers mean. Using Coke and Pepsi as an example, Vanguard is the one of the top two shareholders for both, with roughly an 8% ish stake in each. \n\nBut consider:\n\n1. 8% is not a majority stake and therefore without being majority owners they do not get to direct the company in what to do. 8% is barely enough that if they ally with a couple other entities with large holdings, they mayyyyy be able to get one or two directors on the board of directors. So they own just enough of both Coke and Pepsi that they could get maybe one or two people on their boards to push what they want. \n\n2. Companies like Vanguard and Blackrock are largely passive asset managers (especially Vanguard). This means that they aren\u2019t buying and selling companies based on bets on who they think are winners and losers. They buy pieces of every publicly traded company out there and just hold them and accept the return the market gives them. Due to this philosophy, until very recently entities like Blackrock and Vanguard didn\u2019t often take active roles in proxy votes for companies. They would usually either abstain or vote the way management suggests. There\u2019s nothing nefarious about that, but it has been criticized as an opportunity where these entities could be playing a positive role in pushing these companies towards better business practices but they\u2019ve been taking a back seat and allowing others to make those decisions instead. In recent years, these investment companies have taken a more active role and started voting their shares more often in response to that criticism. \n\nFor example, just last year Blackrock and Vanguard teamed up along with some others to stage a coup at Exxon and install board members that were going to push Exxon to take more drastic action to reduce their environmental impact. \n\n3. These companies may be the stewards of those funds, but it\u2019s the investor\u2019s money not theirs. It\u2019s not like Vanguard has $8trillion that they own. They have $8trillion that they manage but the vast majority of it is owned by their investors who can withdraw it any time they like. \n\n4. For Vanguard specifically she states that their owners are some mystery like probably the Rothschild family or some bullshit like that. This is provably false as you can read up on with a 60 second google search. Vanguard is owned by its funds, which are in turn owned by its investors, which are the 20+ million people that own a vanguard mutual fund or ETF. It\u2019s not some great mystery or conspiracy. It\u2019s literally widely known public information. \n\n5. Literally every proxy vote that Vanguard or Blackrock participates in the information is public. Vanguard even goes so far as to give detailed write ups to the public about how they voted and why. Here\u2019s that example from last year with Exxon:\n\nhttps://global.vanguard.com/documents/voting-insights-exxon.pdf\n\nIt\u2019s not some mystery what they\u2019re up to. It\u2019s pretty transparent, and especially Vanguard. \n\n6. Vanguard is the bane of Wall St and represents everything that Wall St hates. Their whole thing is democratizing investing so that it benefits everyone, not just the wealthy elites. Wall St hates that and that\u2019s why Vanguard is widely reviled among the Wall St elite. They\u2019re not the enemy in the fight to take power from the rich and give it to the people. They\u2019re potentially a very powerful ally that has been fighting that fight since the mid-70s. Lumping them in with Wall St is like lumping Tesla in with \u201ccar companies\u201d or lumping a solar panel company in with \u201coil and gas and other energy companies\u201d. She\u2019s aiming her gun in the complete wrong direction.",

You\u2019re saying they would purposely sabotage their own company, sacrificing their revenue and profits, in an extremely obvious way, for what? To make someone else rich? That\u2019s kind of a wild accusation to throw out there without providing any specifics.\n\nBlackrock and Vanguard get most of their revenue from fees for managing the assets they have stewardship over. Purposely propping up a stick so someone else can sell out means they\u2019re sabotaging their own Assets Under Management, their revenue, their profit. They have no good reason to do that.",

Which would you choose to obtain? Obviously, you\u2019d choose the chair. That\u2019s because there are many types of chair, produced by scores of different companies and widely distributed. You could buy a $15 folding chair or a $1,000 antique without the slightest difficulty. By contrast, to obtain an X-ray you\u2019d have to work with your insurance company, wait for an appointment, and then haggle over price. Why? Because the medical market is far more regulated \u2014 thanks to the widespread perception that health care is a \u201cright\u201d \u2014 than the chair market.*\n\n\n*Does that sound soulless? True soullessness is depriving people of the choices they require because you\u2019re more interested in patting yourself on the back by inventing rights than by incentivizing the creation of goods and services. In health care, we could use a lot less virtue signaling and a lot less government. Or we could just read Senator Sanders\u2019s tweets while we wait in line for a government-sponsored surgery \u2014 dying, presumably, in a decrepit chair.*\n\n\n -Ben Shapiro\n\n\n*****\n\n^(I'm a bot.

I will say that generally, its very likely the classes of stock owned by Blackrock or Vanguard will be common stock which will have economic rights but no control. Blackrock could own 60% of Apple in common stock, and have absolutely no ownership in the company as long as that stock has no voting rights.",

This is representative of the average investor.\n\nThose stores can then get their coke and pepsi directly from the companies, or they can go through a distributor who will supply their coke and pepsi to them in one order. Not only do they provide coke and pepsi though, they also have chips, chocolates, gift cards, and all of the other big brands that sell in stores around you.\n\nSo you can do all the work yourself and have orders from each individual company, or have your distributor (BlackRock/Vanguard) supply everything to you in one go.\n\nBut that doesn't make your distributor an owner of the companies whose products they sell. It just makes them a large purchaser of their products.",

If you buy a fund, you just get the value of the underlying assets at a mix; you have NO voting rights to the underlying shares. Purchasers of bonds, MFs, ETFs, ETNs, and non-\u201cclass-A\u201d stock have no voting rights. \n\nThis is one reason why rich people don\u2019t just buy funds; they buy shares with voting rights. \n\nA good example is Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s BRK.A vs. BRK.B shares. Look up those two tickers and tell me voting rights don\u2019t matter.\n\nSeparately, owning more voting shares means more votes, which is why companies tend to be beholden to the richest shareholders, and why founder/CEOs try to maintain a large enough majority to avoid having to list to other shareholders.

If that\u2019s the case then I am not sure what your point is (indeed, perhaps maybe you don\u2019t know either). Are you saying that you believe Vanguard is nominating the same directors to different boards so that they now control every company?\n\nTo your last two sentences, I haven\u2019t said anything about \u201cpower\u201d (whatever you mean by that), I just think that you do not understand what the Board of a company does or the function it performs. If you think I am a \u201cshill\u201d and \u201csuckin them off\u201d because I do, I am not sure how to help you. \n\nAnyways, if we are throwing around insults, why don\u2019t you learn how to read you fucking idiot. The link you provided doesn\u2019t say what you claim it does - nor does it prove your point. I am not sure if you are deliberately being obtuse or just don\u2019t get it, but I will explain in very simple terms:\n\nYou said: \u201c[T]he fact that all of the biggest companies in the world all share the same board members \u2026\u201d\n\nI said: \u201cThis is not a fact nor is it true.\u201d\n\nThe link you provided says: \u201c78% of the multi-billion dollar companies here have at least one board connection with another company\u201d.\n\nCan you spot the difference? The study itself suggests that of the 50 companies examined only one (3M) had a majority of directors that sit on other such boards. This is obviously a far cry from ALL companies sharing ALL the same board members. I guess I don\u2019t need to provide evidence now, because it seems that you have already done it for me. Also, just FYI I am not sure the information cited in that article is totally accurate. For example, I quickly took a look at 3M\u2019s most recent circular and by my count 2 of 12 directors were serving as a director on another company on that list (although it could be that the info was accurate when posted but is now stale).\n\nAnyways, to paraphrase an internet comment that I once read, if you are going to throw around factually inaccurate statements and then try gloss over them by shifting the goal posts and insulting people who point out that you are wrong, you should never be taken seriously.",

Are these things conspiracies or are there people who have established themselves as competent experts who end up getting called for services again and again? Which is more likely? \n\nI can tell you the vast majority of shareholders vote with management and only when a serious issue pops up or an activist investor jumps in does a board get active. There\u2019s no backroom meeting of Vanguard and Fidelity trying to ensure Mrs. Smith is the future chair every board in corporate America.

There\u2019s a significant difference between those two concepts. \n\nHow would I know there are no back room meetings? Because if there were I would\u2019ve been there. I worked at 2 of the top Investment Banks in the world and as senior management at one of the US\u2019 largest Corporations and I\u2019ve been on multiple boards. I keep getting asked to be on more boards. Generally, I get asked by someone who I have a previous relationship with who is in management of the company. I\u2019ve never been asked to be on a board by a shareholder of a publicly traded company (I have been asked by shareholders of private companies). I\u2019ve also been asked by search firms. In any major company there will be a search firm coordinating the appointment of new board members.\n\nIn my experience firms are highly concerned about the legality and optics of coordination. To say it\u2019s extremely rare would be overstating how frequently it happens. \n\nI\u2019m not suggesting funny business does not happen in isolated incidents. I am stating the fact that it so infrequent that it\u2019s not worth discussing outside of the specific ones that occur. This is also the case for who controls the government. The times where someone was actually bribed for a major change in legislation in the 240 years of US history probably numbers in the dozens. \n\nThere was a great line in the movie Don\u2019t Look Up. A bunch of kids were throwing conspiracy theories at Jennifer Lawrence and she said something to the effect that no it\u2019s actually much dumber and less insidious than you think. She was right.

If she said that, I\u2019d actually mostly agree with her. \n\nSee those are two very different things. The second statement is largely correct. The first statement is conspiracy theory bullshit that makes people dumber. I\u2019d watch the video to check again to see what she said, but honestly someone would have to pay me $25k to sit through that bullshit again. I might actually kill myself if I did.",

I have not done such. \n\nSecondly, it\u2019s possible to chsnge management with zero shares. But to actually FORCE A CHANGE IN MANAGEMENT YOU HAVE TO CONTROL A MAJORITY OF VOTING SHARES. That\u2019s not debatable. So the statement that you can\u2019t change management with 13% of shares isn\u2019t a lie. It\u2019s a fucking fact. \n\nThe word that I implied in the statement is force. I implied \u201cforce,\u201d because the dumbass video only discusses \u201ccontrol.\u201d It doesn\u2019t discuss influence. \n\nFinally BlackRock is ceding control of voting to its customers. At this point it\u2019s their largest customers. So the fuck what. This is a counter to the bullshit concept in the video that BlackRock, the entity, controls the fucking world. It was not meant to say that anyone who owns a mutual funds gets to vote. \n\nSo everything I\u2019ve said is 100% verifiably correct. It\u2019s certainly not a lie.

What I think is more likely, is they'll find some sort of online community that agrees with everything they already believe, no matter how factually inaccurate.\n\n>Is it better to be anti-vax, or be sacrificing albinos in Ugandan witchcraft rituals to stave off COVID-19?\n\nI don't know, they're bad at different scales.

When you sell a share of VOO that doesn't go direct through to another B/D on a secondary market then its up to the AP to sell a basket of those securities on the open market and deliver the share back to the issuer (blackrock). for every share of VOO, a basket of securities that makes up the underlying companies is held at the issuer. \n\nNow the voting rights get tricky. depending on the fund mandate they will issue voting rights via proxy to the individual B/Ds or make up a team that is insanely closely regulated to ensure they are acting in the interests of the shareholders (the fund owners). their interactions and decisions are incredibly well documented.\n\nif your point is that when you buy voo that you dont get 500 partial shares in your brokerage account then yea... but that basket of securities is directly tied to your account held at the issuer. however ownership is the shareholders, not blackrocks.",

      "text": "Wowza. She's so off base it hurts. Let's start from the beginning.\n\nAn [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) is a set of rules that attempt to follow the performance of some market. So an oil index could be the average value of all oil companies. An index fund implements an index by buying assets, mixing them up according to the rules of the index, and reselling that mix in small pieces. With [passive investing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/passiveinvesting.asp) the idea is to buy and hold index funds forever at a very low cost basis. Cost basis is the price you pay a company to administer shares of some fund. [Assets under management](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/aum.asp) refers to the assets held by investment management companies on behalf of clients, often in passively invested index funds. Vanguard is an investment management company that pioneered low cost, passively invested index funds a few decades back. These indices follow very simple rules. For example, include the top 100 most valuable companies in a market in proportion to their value of the top 100 most valuable companies. This is called [market weighting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp).\n\nSo the point I'm getting at with all this is that yes, Blackrock and Vanguard have a huge amount of assets under management. But they do not and cannot actively do much of anything with those funds. As a matter of fact Vanguard is very highly regarded in the investment community for being no frills, super boring and investor friendly. They offer simple products and don't take big risks. And they started doing that back in the 70s and 80s when coked up active investors were all the rage.\n\nOn a second point, when people talk about Wall Street they are usually not talking about Vanguard. Passively invested index funds are held by pensions, individuals and other companies. Wall Street instead generally refers to hedge funds and derivatives markets that involve risky short term bets that result in suspiciously and consistently large profits. Many large banks and companies from GE to Merrill Lynch have hedge funds or investment departments doing as much. The ire against Wall Street is due to the systemic risk posed by the fraud and corruption that so consistently underlies the investment strategies of these firms.",

Like Occupy Wall Street wasn't really mad about passive investment funds. And when the twelve banks were brought to the table for the financial meltdown in 08, Vanguard wasn't in the picture at all.\n\n**EDIT:** Oh also Blackrock is a little different. They have a range of products, some more actively invested than others.",

More actively managed funds have a greater hand in the companies they manage. Venture capital is highly active, fund managers there often exercise direct influence over the businesses they invest in. The article calls this out exactly:\n\n>The shareholder rebellion at the ExxonMobil annual meeting in Dallas was led by major financial advisory firms and fund managers who traditionally have played passive roles\n\nLarge passive funds exercised their right to vote as shareholders due to a systemic risk to the entire market. This is highly irregular, but not anything special or overtly interesting in terms of how power was exercised. It's definitely not what you've suggested.\n\nAdditionally, the resolution they voted on was co-sponsored by a large pension fund, and presumably a very large customer. I'm sure this was a conscious move by these investment firms to signal that the votes against management were shareholder led. As the article states though \"ExxonMobil rarely loses a shareholder resolution.\" This is true for most other major corporations as well.",

I'd probably rephrase it as such: \"index fund managers have, in very rare cases, exerted influence in shareholders interests through shareholder votes.\"\n\nBut really, you're moving the goal posts. This is what you said originally:\n\n>The point is that the passive funds exercise tons of control over the companies that they own. They can pressure a CEO to entirely reshape the business and slash its diversification if they decide it\u2019ll help them. I\u2019ll go as far as saying harm the long term viability of the business.\n\nI haven't done any Google searches in this debate. You did one to prove the claim above. I then used your source to disprove your claim that \"passive funds exercise tons of control over the companies that they own.\" This is patently and plainly false. It doesn't even make intuitive sense with the incentives and structure of the market.\n\nI'm glad you think you understand this, but you haven't been able to produce a compelling source or argument so far. If you can't prove your original claim, concede it. Or let's agree to disagree there.",

But it's only because they are sellers of investment funds, such as index ETFs. And as such, they have to own the companies that make up the index. If they sell an S&P 500 index fund, they have to own the shares of the underlying 500 companies (in the correct proportions). Historically, these fund providers have not exercised the voting power their shares allow them, since they do not see themselves as activist investors (such as Bill Ackman or Carl Icahn), they are simply a pass-through vehicle for average investors. However, there has been some talk recently about them actually trying to push through some ESG changes in the companies they own.",

They are the exact opposite of activist investors.\n\nIt's also why this video falls under \"confidently incorrect.\" Exactly no one is concerned that Vanguard and Blackrock are exerting too much control over firms. They are concerned that they are just indifferently holding stocks and free-riding off of the price discovery of others. I don't actually agree with those people for a variety of loosely held reasons (my Ph.D. is in finance but my research does not focus on this issue), but this is the first time that I have heard someone complain about them controlling firms, because they DEFINITELY do not do that in real life.",

Vanguard and even Blackrock have been on average forces for good in the industry through their cheap index products, but they have sat on their hands for 90% of their history and also within their passive funds cannot exert selling as a force for change. Moreover, even now, for 98% of the firms they hold, they do not take an activist angle, which is probably a good thing for everyone including Vanguard. I am more than happy to see Vanguard's improvements in corporate governance but they are not throwing their weight around generally.

Since they run the passive index funds, they do get voting privileges over all these companies. \n\nThere IS real concern of the impact on this on corporate governance, and there's a lot of work in industry right now to fix it.\n\nBut Blackrock and Vanguard don't \"own\" the companies, although they did functionally have near veto power over board nominees, which is a problem. They rarely, if ever, use this power though, because they are aware of the perceptual issues here. \n\nVanguard doesn't have owners, not because of a conspiracy, but because they have a unique governance structure where the people who buy their funds actually own the company. It's how they keep costs so low.",

Lol, yeah go ahead an call me a conspiracy theorist but look around, you think the world stage represents what the average person wants??

And therein lies the trap, everyone is concerned about their immediate surrounding and taking care of their loved ones while we get collectively led along by economic interests who are the real driving force behind pretty much everything and the game keeps getting played, while the vast majority suffer endlessly",

Blackrock specifically is purchasing housing at an unprecedented speed to create a permanent renters class, in an economy that already has a mass shortage of housing. As for all companies being owned by these two? That's also not really right, but it is true that a majority of big names are partially owned by the same names, such as McDonalds and the company that makes their ice cream machines. Those things are a nightmare to clean compared to other machines of higher quality, but because the same people own shares of the two companies, it's a working arrangement to profit both sides. Somewhere, there is a great graph that lays out how the majority of reputable brands are owned by three or four big names. Shit sucks, but I'm not gonna do some lame ass dance to spread awareness. When the time is right, I'll probably just off myself in front of congress or something lmao",
