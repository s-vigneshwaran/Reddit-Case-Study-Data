  "text": "Pope under fire after calling people \u2018selfish\u2019 for having pets instead of kids\nTL;DR of article: Pope Francis spoke to a general audience yesterday saying that the willingness of some couples to have pets in their home instead of birthing children is \"selfish\" and will eventually lead to a loss of humanity. Multiple public figures have pushed back against the Pope's comments.\n\n[Link to article](https://globalnews.ca/news/8490958/pope-pets-children-comment/)\n\nHonestly, it's so hard these days to be surprised by the Catholic Church's tirades. Sadly, the feeling of disgust, especially as a Catholic educator, remains.\n\nTo see someone with so much influence whining about birth declinations during a global pandemic is upsetting, but I'm definitely glad that many people on the Internet aren't taking that quietly.\n\n\\\\rant over",

It\u2019s two hours a week every week through whole school system, so from 6 years olds to 19 years olds. Often in the middle of the school day so the children that don\u2019t attend just wait for an hour for another lesson. It\u2019s been like that since 1990s. For years absolute majority attended those lessons. There was one child in my school who wasn\u2019t enrolled. One child. In about 1500 students. It\u2019s changing. Slowly but it is.

He eventually did end up cutting all communications with me and I was pretty upset.  The last time I saw him he was living at his grandpa's house and was chasing the dragon.  Nothing he or I could do about this outcome being kids and all.  The amount of \"I found Jesus\" people are greatly outweighed by people who were born into this indoctrination.  Every church you see will always have youth groups to brainwash children.",

Every single day theyd tell me i needed god and literally nothing else could help me.

Including living in sober living for 8 months\n\nA lot of people are so desperate for an answer they'll accept anything they're told will help and then as a result base their sobriety on the flimsiest framework ever: faith.\n\nThey take away EVERY coping mechanism to force you to accept God is the only way that can help. The rehabs literally call it \"giving them the gift of desperation\" meaning that its a gift to be so desperate that you finally accept god.\n\nI was reading a novel one time at rehab and they took it from me and gave me the big AA book and said thats all i should be reading (A sexist uninformed unscientific book from the late 1930s). They revere that book more than the bible and then get mad when i call them on being a cult. A book that existed before any of the modern scientific understanding of how addiction works in the brain. \n\n\nIt appals me that insurance is paying for faith based pseudoscience bullshit treatments that actually are counterproductive for people like me who have conviction with their atheistic beliefs.  I spent 3 years in and out of rehab constantly and they all do this. Every single one. \n\nI could go on so long about how cultish and abusive these places usually are. Having prayer payed for by insurance. Disgusting.",

Because your higher power has to be able to be a sentient being to make any sense with what they're teaching. Its still a diety. And the big book definitely is talking about a specific god i mean... Written by white christian men in the 30s...\n\nThey take you to christian churches in rehab to do meetings. They talk about christian teachings and nonstop about the christian god... Like, the big book says god every other word. And 99% of the time people call their higher power god. Technically you can pick your own \"higher power\" but no matter what, the way they teach you to talk to your higher power, and all that...its just god. \n\nI would get in debates because your higher power has to be sentient, able to save you, and they force you to acknowledge it. They would argue with me when I told them i wasnt going to place my faith in something that cant even be proven to exist.\n\nIts a lot more complicated than i can explain but when they say higher power, they always mean it as a supernatural diety. You generally arent allowed to pick some physical inanimate object. Its a diety that youre told to pray to for guidance, and that guidance is supernaturally literally the only thing that can save you.\n\nI call it a cult because it has soooo many similarities to christianity they just dont blatantly say it to be more inclusive and not scare people off.\n\nMost AA meetings ive been to are in churches and feel more like a church service than anything. You say the same prayers FROM THE BIBLE at the beginning of every single AA meeting. You read a verse from the book to open and close each meeting. People memorize the big book to throw out verses exactly like the Bible. They constantly talk about god. Every single thing they talk about explicitly involved god, and while they claim it just has to be any higher power, they almost explicitly talk about it under the label god. So to me, it is the Christian god that they focus on and so its a very Christian institution.\n\n\nI could spend so much time putting this more eloquently.... But maybe I'll just make a book",

It doesn't give you the tools to move past your addiction.  In fact it demands that addiction continues to make up a large part of your identity.

Real medical evidence based programs cost more than college and aren't covered by insurance, even though some people can get state insurance. If he had access to alternatives he might be alive today. AA isn't even effective for those who believe in god and it's basically foisted on the poor and lower classes because it's literally the only option. So I honestly think that the only reason it stays around is population control because once rich people started dying from this we started having a medical scientific approach \ud83e\udd14 But the medical scientific approach costs money so not everyone can get it. The only programs like methadone and suboxone require you to arrange your work schedule around them, which only the wealthy can do. So this creates a permanent underclass where they have to choose between their jobs and their medications. If they go off it they die. If they live they never get ahead.",

The inquisition had requested burning at the stake but the civil authority overruled it.\n\nMaria Camila O'Gorman Xim\u00e9nez was 8 months pregnant when she was executed by firing squad for having put the \"moral values and sacred religious norms of a whole society are at stake\" by having an affair with a priest in 1848. Don't worry though, they \"baptised\" the fetus by having Maria drink holy water first.\n\nSo it's been 14 popes since the last order for public burning at the stake for the crime of heresy, though the sentence was changed to hanging. Considering they're voted in as geriatrics, that's still impressively recent.",

              "text": "That comment I made was a bit assumptive. While the official Catholic position was always against abortion, opposition wasn't always a priority for them or the pan-Christian wedge issue that we see today:\n\n> Before the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which resulted in the legalization of abortion in the United States, the United States right-to-life movement consisted of lawyers, politicians, and doctors, almost all of whom were Catholic. The only coordinated opposition to abortion during the early 1970s came from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Family Life Bureau, also a Catholic organization. According to Charles Curran, prior to Roe v. Wade abortion was not a high priority for Catholic bishops in the United States.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_and_the_Catholic_Church_in_the_United_States\n\nIn fact, Baptists were largely pro-choice before *Roe*:\n\n> Today, evangelicals make up the backbone of the pro-life movement, but it hasn\u2019t always been so. Both before and for several years after Roe, evangelicals were overwhelmingly indifferent to the subject, which they considered a \u201cCatholic issue.\u201d In 1968, for instance, a symposium sponsored by the Christian Medical Society and Christianity Today, the flagship magazine of evangelicalism, refused to characterize abortion as sinful, citing \u201cindividual health, family welfare, and social responsibility\u201d as justifications for ending a pregnancy. In 1971, delegates to the Southern Baptist Convention in St. Louis, Missouri, passed a resolution encouraging \u201cSouthern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.\u201d The convention, hardly a redoubt of liberal values, reaffirmed that position in 1974, one year after Roe, and again in 1976.\n\n> When the Roe decision was handed down, W. A. Criswell, the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s former president and pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas\u2014also one of the most famous fundamentalists of the 20th century\u2014was pleased: \u201cI have always felt that it was only after a child was born and had a life separate from its mother that it became an individual person,\u201d he said, \u201cand it has always, therefore, seemed to me that what is best for the mother and for the future should be allowed.\u201d\n\n> Although a few evangelical voices, including Christianity Today magazine, mildly criticized the ruling, the overwhelming response was silence, even approval. Baptists, in particular, applauded the decision as an appropriate articulation of the division between church and state, between personal morality and state regulation of individual behavior. \u201cReligious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision,\u201d wrote W. Barry Garrett of Baptist Press.\n\nhttps://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/05/religious-right-real-origins-107133/\n\n\n\nMany [clergy members were even fighting for womens' access to abortion](https://time.com/4758285/clergy-consultation-abortion/) in the 70's.\n\nI can't definitively say this change was because of awareness regarding how religiosity perpetuates, but it seems likely. The nature of abortion didn't change and yet their position on it seems to have. When I imagine myself in their shoes that makes the most sense to explain this shift and political realignment.",

My understanding is that due to the fertility reduction that occurs when women are educated and quality of life improves, human population is predicted to become stable somewhere around 11\u201312 billion. \n\nWe are currently at 8 billion and already the effects of population pressures are existential crises that threaten our long-term prosperity and survival. I listed many of them above. With 50% more people on this planet they will be severely exacerbated. We already have enough people to end life on this planet as we know it, and there are more coming. This is a problem even if there's an end to the growth in sight.\n\nA technological solution might emerge but then again it might not. Ignoring the consequences of our growth because we believe a solution will one day appear is not wise. It's a little like buying a house one can't afford because they believe one day they will have a job that will allow them to. That's risky and might result in homelessness.\n\nOftentimes the problem is not insufficient resources, it's too many, as in the case of carbon emissions. Sometimes it is indeed insufficient resources, we only have a finite amount on this rock even if we have not approached the limits in many domains. Personally I would much rather live on a planet with fewer people and more potential energy and resources per person than one full of human beings who are limited, rationed, and devalued by volume.",

That\u2019s what religious people do\u2026.\n\nExcept virginity is objectively not real. Isn't that an important thing to consider? We know how well things go when you make something imaginary too important.\n\nAnd don't put words in my mouth. I haven't told anyone what it is they should consider important. Not once. I said I found it weird, but not that you *should* stop thinking of it that way. I was criticizing the idea of virginity itself. So kindly take back the words you put in my mouth, fucker.\n\n>Either way you\u2019re missing the point. That\u2019s not dark humor because it\u2019s not even funny. I\u2019ve been to two shows of Daniel Sloss (look him up on Netflix and HBO Max) who is considered a very dark comedian. He knows how to make dark jokes about pedophiles and they\u2019re actually funny. If the joke was actually funny I wouldn\u2019t have commented, but the person who presented it did a shit job of it. There\u2019s a very fine line between dark humor and being a dick (see Donald Trump).\n\nI'm sorry, but because you don't find it funny doesn't mean it isn't for others. That's a personal bias and you're trying to make it fact, like religious people do. If you wanna talk about people being dicks, people that only read what they want to read and put words in people's mouths can be considered dicks. Like you, in case you can't tell that I'm pointing at you.",

In this case, finance isnt the subject of why they are being selfish.\n\nHowever, if someone is having a child for non selfish reasons, even if it's determental to themselves, it's not selfish. Eg. someone having a child to please another person (parent, spouse).",

You get to do all the fun play stuff and enjoy the company of a living being that loves you unconditionally, but you never have to move past that phase, which to be honest, is probably when enjoyment of parenthood peaks, and you can always leave your dog with somebody else or a pet boarding service when it would be more convenient for you to do something without being weighed down, which you obviously can't do with kids.",

The women in my old church had them so young and praise was heaped on them. So much fuss made over every marriage and every baby. Children are accessories for the church, paraded by parents who indoctrinate them from birth. \n\nThey encourage birth, not care after the birth, treating children like trophies. My family of seven was a point of pride for my mother, she just kept having babies regardless of whether or not she could support them. And treating those new humans like people? Fuck that, they\u2019re just tools to prop up old superstitions. \n\nI have cats because I made the choice not to inflict the same damage upon a child that my parents and the world inflicted on me. Maybe instead of whining and bitching about young people making the choice to not have kids, the Catholic Church should put its resources into fixing the problems that led young people to decide not to have kids",
