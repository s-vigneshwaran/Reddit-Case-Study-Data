It built upon the (now disproven) idea that cranial musculature was connected with brain function, leading to the conclusion that the size of various bumps and ridges on your head could be used to measure your cognitive function. We now know that such assumptions are completely false and that external cranial structures have practically no influence on the brain, barring major deformity or trauma. \n\nPhrenology was, of course, quickly adopted by various groups as a way to espouse an \u201cobjective and scientific\u201d proof of their genetic superiority. European phrenologists would identify the skull of the Caucasian male as demonstrative of \u201cbeauty\u201d and \u201csuperiority\u201d over \u201cless developed\u201d groups. They linked various regions to higher cognitive functions and capabilities. Certain phrenologists famously used their conclusions as a scientific support of slavery, among other things. \n\nOf course, phrenology received its fair share of criticisms even at the time and quickly fell into the pseudoscience definition given its inability to align with empirical testing and newer discoveries. However, it did leave a legacy that occasionally pops up to this very day. If you\u2019ve ever seen memes or images comparing the skulls of various human groups, you can know that such comparisons were rooted in phrenology.",

Let's say the ground rules are that they must have evolved from some Earth species such that they existed fully-formed in the Age of Sail.  (To rule out the possibility of aliens or genetically modified future humans or something.)\n\nThe big question to start with is what major grouping do they belong to?  Fish?  Maybe some kind of mollusk like a squid or nudibranch (they're colorful and weird enough if they could be scaled up)?\n\nMarine mammal seems like it would be the shortest evolutionary path toward a human-like upper-body and social intelligence.  Maybe an otter relative that loses its back limbs?\n\nSincerely, I'd love to hear a more informed take on the concept.  (**Edit:**  Did I just commit a terrible faux pas by referring to \"fish\" like it's a simple category?  I know some biologists have strong feelings about the term.)",

I'm going to be working with kids this year versus college/grad students and I'm excited to modify this lesson for younger age group.\n\nThe assignment in tl;dr form is: Create a half-humanoid, half-some-other-marine-species organism that could survive in a chosen environment and be able to provide justification for answers (must address all major life systems). I'll either give a choice or assign an environment: deep sea, shallow tropics, polar oceans, river system, etc. I'll ask for a picture, description, and answers to certain set questions. In the class presentation, they're asked further questions to justify their choices. People usually make this creature a marine mammal, but I've never specified that the top half had to be human, so sometimes you get fun combos. Typically, these creatures end up looking like bizarre, fleshy, and hairy manatees with better limb dexterity (but often no fingers) and massive eyes. I'm personally waiting for the day I get a submission like Ursula a la The Little Mermaid.\n\nIn reference to your last question, I'm more a marine mammal and seabird person, but my fish colleagues have strong opinions (lol). Rule of thumb, though, is that if you're referring to a bunch of fish of a singular species, it's \"fish\" and if it's any number of fish of different species, you'd say \"fishes.\" :)",

Therefore, the skin color of any given mermaid population depends on both latitude and average depth of habitation. From this, we can simply infer that Halle Bailey's Ariel lives in shallow water and likely near the equator, while the OG animated Ariel lives in much deeper water, likely in northern Europe based on the light skin of the humans she encounters.\n\nSo Halle Bailey's Ariel IS scientifically accurate in regards to skin tone, but she lives in a different location than the OG animated Ariel.",

      "text": "No, this makes total sense. I back this guy, and I understand where he's coming from. I also want to add a couple of tweaks. She'd likely have smaller steerer fins, too, because, you know, thrashing a tail around can be hard to manoeuvre with. Also no hair. Like none. Her head (by my estimate) would have no hair and be kind of pointy. Shorten the arms, because underwater they won't do much. And she's not gonna be abyssopelagic, so rather than making her pale and slimy, toss some blue or green, brighten that skin up. Add scales, too. Yk, cause that'll reduce drag and also serve as a coating of armour. I would also recommend rotating her tail 90 degrees, because assuming she's a fish-man cross, she'd likely have a tail that swings side-to-side like actual fish (considering this from a science perspective). Also change up the teeth. I don't think fish would use the human three-type tooth system (dunno the technical term). Make them conical and sharp, because she needs to eat somehow, and fellow undersea creatures tend to be slippery. While you're at it, shift her features up, so her nose is at her front while she's laying down, the mouth is out front, and the eyes are on the sides, facing forwards. Also reduce the body cross-section. Having the body cross-section of a person with a flare at the hip doesn't look very hydrodynamic. Swap that out and make Ariel thinner laterally and wider vertically, so that she's more flat and hydrodynamic. Copy+Paste these scientifically accurate (again, to the best of my knowledge) edits onto the rest of the mermaids, and viola, you have a film that'll be beautiful. Also, for the sake of accuracy, cut out the whole land prince subplot. That's a minor annoyance from the original that can be improved for scientific accuracy.",

Mermaids are predatory. Forward facing eyes, grasping limbs. \n\n3. Mermaids are intelligent. They use tools, weapons, and even other sea creatures as accessories. \n\n4. They distinctly mimic human biology. A non-mammalian sea creature does not accidentally develop faux hair, faux human skin, human cries and a humanoid torso. \n\n5. They are often found along coastal human settlements. \n\n\n\nPoints 2-5 make it painfully clear that humans are the primary food source for the mermaid. \n\nPoints 1-4 indicate near human level intelligence and skill in deception. \n\n\nThe smartest creature in the sea lives only around three years, and never passes down its knowledge, as it dies before its young develop. What if this wasn't the case? What if these intelligent mimics developed a culture, taught each other, and entered a Bronze Age just under the waves, just out of sight. Mermaids aren't half-human, half-fish. They aren't even fish at all. They're cephalopods.\n\n\n What's one trait that octopus, squid and cuttlefish all share? Shifting pigmentation. Some use it for camouflage or communication. But a particularly well taught cephalopod might use it to mimic its prey. Down to their very skin color.",

They'd just have a light-scale belly, like some fish have to confuse predators. It make it look like they are better lit from below, which confuses the brain as that's normally not how light and perspective work.\n\nLook at the black koi. Dark fish, light belly. White catfish? Dark fish, light belly. Unless they're poisonous. Poisonous sea creatures would be very bright and colorful to warn potential predators. \n\nThat's of course when you assume they'd be prey. However, if you see they 'rule' the seas, have armies etc, they own the place. \nThey're not prey...\n\nThe ocean is pretty dark, so having a darker skin would make them less visible and better at hunting. Basically the opposite of being poisonous, where you would hide and attack others with your venomous bite, like a snake. \n\nSo Perhaps **cartoon Ariel is canonically poisonous-prey**, while **live-action Ariel is canonically venomous predator**?",

      "text": "He kinda has a point as the skin color depends on melanin, and that depends on the exposition to the sunlight. Deep underwater there is close to no sunlight, so from an evolutory standpoint, there is need for melanin so there should be only grey pale mermaids.\n\nBut the thing is the following: mermaids & co are very intelligent, so it is easy to assume that they won't stay onky on the deep parts of the ocean, so some of them will stay in what we call vacational zones(Cancun, Carribe, etc) and closer to the surface, thus the need for melanin increases,  there should be more melanin for the me mermaids in swallow water, thus having an evolutory reason to have black mermaids. From this point it's all migration just like on the land: people will go somewhere else, and black people won't stop being black because there isn't as much sunlight as in places like Africa. So black mermaids are viable, if mermaids existed.\n\nSo yeah, a closed lineage of deep ocean mermaids can't be black, but neither white. They'd be more like vampire/drow pale. Also they'd be mostly blind because no sunlight = no light = no colors = no need to see the way we do so no human like eyes, unless they have artificial lights.",

How are they gonna do that if they live deep in the ocean.\n\nActually, if we're really going to play the worldbuilding game, you would expect deepwater mermaids to have less less melanin, while mermaids living near/on the surface should have a bunch, since near the ocean surface, UV rays are pretty strong- seriously, sunburn is a genuine risk for swimmers. So the mermaids that live near the surface- the ones humans are likely to meet and make friends with- would probably have darker skin, while the ones living in deep ocean trenches far from the sun would be paler and also probably not have eyes, on account of the lack of light.. and maybe the needle-like teeth characteristic of a lot of deep-sea predators. [Come to think of it, that kinda reminds me of a different pale humanoid without eyes that's definitely not a metaphor for anything.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i3oRxm8G0o)",

When Tolkien wrote the story of the Lord of the rings and created these fictitious magical races of people, he didn\u2019t exclude blacks and Hispanics because he was racist. He merely developed characters from his own creativity no doubt influenced by his surroundings. It is for the same reason that if you found a black story writer in a black country who had very little exposure to white people all of their characters would likely be black. \nWhen you have been repressed as a people, and you finally get a platform and an audience to achieve true quality, embrace it and implement your own creativity and drive. Stop trying to go backwards in history and rewrite everything falsely to blend yourself in. You only dilute yourself and your people, you do not achieve equality in this fashion",
