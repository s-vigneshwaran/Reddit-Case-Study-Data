He gets \"tips\" from \"sources\" then reports them on his shitty show as if they were fact.  He has accused many people of many things, including nearly ruining the life of some old man who streamed RuneScape to a smallish audience because someone with the same name was convicted of being a pedophile and the angry gnome couldn't be bothered to consider the fact that people can have the same name as other people, the streamer looked totally different than the pictures given of the convicted man, or the fact that the convicted man was probably in prison for the crimes he was convicted of, not playing RuneScape for a small crowd.\n\nI think that's the best example of the kind of shit Keemstar does.  He seeks to ruin lives and hurt other people because it makes good drama, and he makes a living telling people about drama.  Other notable examples include telling TotalBiscuit \"can't wait to report your death\" during his battle with cancer (which he did did from), asking Etika why he \"doesn't just kill himself\" while Etika has having a battle with serious mental health issues (that again did claim his life), and I'm sure countless other false accusations.  Everything this man touches turns to poison.",

One meant for males and the other one for females.\nRecently its been accepted, to some degree, to change the las vowel to \u201ce\u201d as in \u201cElles\u201d, to make it gender neutral but thats a new made up word spanish speakers had to make up to be inclusive, and its not just that word is every word thats gender specific which in spanish are a lot. Some people are angry about it saying they\u2019re ruining the language and its difficult for people to wrap their heads around it. \nEnglish has many gender neutral alternatives without having to change the language per se. But imagine now instead of saying \u201cdoctor\u201d you had to say \u201cdocter\u201d to make it gender neutral.

But then a friend asked me to start using they/them, and it was difficult at first, but now it comes so naturally that I\u2019ve started using it as my default pronoun for someone until I get a chance to know them better.\n\nAnd I think you\u2019d be surprised at just how rarely it becomes confusing in person. There are so many little things in spoken language that pass by so quickly but which reinforce context. I might be talking about someone for like 30 seconds and use their name first, then use pronouns for most sentences, but you really get a feel for if you\u2019re losing the context and just use the person\u2019s name again to reinforce it.\n\nI can maintain a conversation even with my most conservative friends who would refuse to use they/them as pronouns when talking about someone, and literally never use he/him or she/her, and the conservative friend won\u2019t even realise I\u2019m being gender neutral throughout the conversation.\n\nIt took a bit of practice to get used to, but given the direction the zeitgeist is heading, it\u2019s going to be a very useful skill to have.",

At least, he's right in the context I'm certain he's speaking to, which is the Old Testament, considering he's Jewish.\n\nThe books of the Old Testament were all originally written in either Aramaic or ancient Hebrew. Neither of those languages _has_ a gender neutral pronoun option. (A group started working in 2018 to add a singular they to modern Hebrew.) The Jewish Bible doesn't contain singular they because it _could not have_ contained singular they. The language it's written in doesn't allow for the possibility.\n\nIf you expand the discussion to the New Testament, parts of which were written in Kione Greek, then Ben's statement is probably false, since Greek does have the option for a singular they equivalent.\n\nI'm not going to comb through the NT books which were originally in Greek to find a specific example in order to say it's definitely false, but it's highly likely that a gender neutral third person singular pronoun pops up at some point in the text, considering how often it's used in other languages. Also, Greek versions of the Bible _always_ use gender neutral to refer to the Holy Spirit (because \"spirit\" is a gender neutral word in Greek), so as soon as the Holy Spirit is referred to by a pronoun that would be an example.",

E.g. referring to a truck driver (stereotypically male job) as \"they\" is significantly less confusing to people than referring to a truck driver as \"she\". (See Fig. 2)\n\nIn cases where \"they\" was used in contexts without a stereotypic gender, it did take slightly longer to read, but this amount is easily within the error bars.\n\nI think most people wouldn't complain about referring to a female truck driver as \"she\", so they also probably shouldn't complain about referring to an enby truck driver as \"they\".",

Maybe pants (short for pantaloons?) were actually two separate pieces of cloth, similar to socks, so a single pantaloon was once a thing, but at some point tailors made them a single piece of cloth, and the word pants came after that, making a singular \"pant\" not make any sense since they're always a conjoined pair.

But if you're anything like me, your brain thinks Brian and at least one other person is involved.\n\nBy convention, \"they\" can be used for singular or plural unknown people, and everyone does that constantly, but it can't be used for singular known parties (until recently), so my brain thinks it has lost track of whoever else is involved here.\n\nThat said, there isn't a great, popular alternative for this case, so I get using it. I just want a new, unambiguous word.\n\nOr for authors to understand that they now need to reword things to remove that ambiguity, but most of the authors I read are 14-year-olds making Reddit comments, so that's unlikely.\n\nI want to reiterate that I respect the wishes of those who request specific pronouns to the best of my ability, because I don't enjoy being an asshole to people.

Not to mention repeatedly using nicknames like that is harassment anyway and I would be pissed too\n\nDid you miss that it was their FINAL DAY that the argument happened? They were \"fired\" three days after they had already quit. So clearly they were not fired because of their identity or them discussing it... Jessie also admits that's not the case at all if you actually read their own version of the events. They were the one to initiate the confrontation and so on. As I said before, Gobelle is an ass, but the fact remains that he was fined for using the wrong pronoun, period. That's really the end of the matter within the scope of anything that's relevant here...\n\n> In the second case it was an active hate campaign against a transgender candidate. They purposefully used inflammatory language about their identity to \u201cwarn\u201d people about them. They were able to make a case that posting such fliers around the community on such a high profile way made them feel unsafe.\n\nRight, and as I said before, they're an ass. But it doesn't change that they were literally fined for having used the wrong pronouns. Everything else in the flier was protected speech. Hell the judge goes on and makes it a specific point that because he continued doing it during trial was one of the main reasons for the decisions. That makes it ABUNDANTLY clear that it's the specific act of not using their preferred pronouns that they're being punished for. The very thing you claimed was false and didn't happen...\n\n> They were not just about pronouns at all.\n\n\"Just\" doesn't matter... And in both cases, it literally was...\n\n>I don\u2019t care if they don\u2019t believe your gender can change. That still doesn\u2019t mean they can fire people for wanting basic respect in their workplace, nor that they can post fliers around the community that have a huge potential to incite hate against someone like that.\n\nThey weren't fired for wanting basic respect. Had they been they would have been fired the instant they contacted Kingsberry, who not only didn't fire her, but commended them for their work. The firing was because they were comative and BY THEIR OWN ACCOUNT, started screaming and berating another employee. Which guess what, actually IS a perfectly valid reason to fire someone. The court never at any point says it was an unjustified termination. The only question the court looks at, was if they were discriminated against by being referred to by different pronouns than their preferred ones and the court says that was the case. The termination after the fact that they had already quit, was completely outside the bounds of the case and was never even tried. They were fully aware that it was a legitimate termination.\n\nAnd for posting fliers, stating all TRUE THINGS, is well within the bounds of the laws. The ONLY issue in the flier that the court latched on to, was the wrong pronouns. That something has potential to incite hate, isn't something the are responsible for. That's simply not how responsibility works. You are responsible for YOUR actions, not someone else's actions, and even less so are you responsible for their actions simply because you stated some true things about them. If publicly saying what you're actually doing is inciting hatred towards you... Then perhaps it's time to rethink what the hell it is you're actually doing rather than blame the one revealing what you're doing...",

Most have some form of social transition (name or pronoun changes being the common one). As my therapist put it; just because it's \"only a social transition\" doesn't lessen the fact it is a transition. \n\n\nIn summary; Non binary is seen as a subgroup of being trans. Non-binary phobia specifically is often coined as \"enbyphobic\" (\"enby\" being the phonetic version of NB, the acronym for Non-Binary)",

Of the few examples that exclude a plural interpretation it usually has a very defined context.\n\nI want to be clear that I am not against gender neutral pronouns, I'm happy to use them, but we shouldn't be co-opting a piece of language with a highly accepted use case to fix this problem.\n\nOne thing I haven't seen many people do is explore the problems this creates as a counter point.\n\n\"Do you have extra ice cream, they want more\"\n\n\"They are coming over at 9:30\"\n\n\"Doctor, there was a vehicle collision on the highway and they will be coming in with blunt force injuries.\"\n\nThe average English reader will read all of these as plural.  One immediate issue that arises is what to do with verbs following this new singular pronoun as it immediately strikes the listener as incorrect when you apply existing verb forms:\n\n\"Do you have extra ice cream, she/he wants more.\" \nAs opposed to:\n\"Do you have extra ice cream, they wants more.\"\n\nMy main concern with this practice is that it creates even more ambiguity in a language that is already context dependent.\n\nAgain, I'm all for non gendered pronouns, but we should create them new, not repurpose something that's existing.\n\nJust my thoughts and I'm interested in any way someone has to alleviate these issues outside of dedicated pronouns.",

You waved off two of my examples saying that context would solve them and the final one you couldn't wave off you just said it wouldn't be said that way despite it being completely grammatically correct.  Context dependent pronouns are not something you change overnight and ignoring valid criticisms of a proposed use isn't going to get the changes you want adopted any faster.\n\nI keep seeing everyone mention how the singular form of this pronoun dates back to 1345 but ignoring the hundreds of other language functions that date back to then that we have entirely abandoned or are now considered outright wrong.\n\nIf history is our teacher, this change won't be publicly accepted for a very long time and that's only if a large majority of people can be made to accept it, something that doesn't show any signs of happening soon.",

Why? Because instead of using they/them pronouns for someone of an already specified gender, you are now using it correctly by using it for someone of an unspecified/unknown gender.\n\nOr at least that's my opinion on why that sentence sounds weird.",

Anyway, I\u2019d argue that using vernacular English, which definitely includes a singular \u201cthey\u201d (as illustrated by this example) is less ideological than trying to enforce artificial rules on the language that contradict the way people actually speak.\n\nEdit: sorry, I misread your comment. You believe that \u201csomeone\u201d can be plural. Can you use it that way in a sentence? Would you say, for example, \u201cSomeone are walking down the road\u201d?\n\nEdit 2: You seem to think than an indefinite thing also means an indefinite quantity of that thing. This is incorrect. For example, I could say \u201ca house\u201d and \u201cthe house\u201d - the first example refers to any house, while the second refers to a specific house. But both refer to only one house. Similarly, \u201csomeone\u201d is like saying \u201ca person,\u201d rather than a specific person. But it still refers to only one person.",

Reddit and social media as a whole is mostly made of young Americans, it's an echo chamber where they think everyone else is on board with what they're doing. Which is why it makes me laugh when I see people demand shit like this because the moment you come off of reddit and step outside and interact with people, most of them aren't gonna give a fuck about your wishes because they don't have to. And my only advice to dealing with that would be to grow some thicker skin because if you react harshly to those people then you will just lose any chance you had of gaining their respect. If you can show it doesn't bother you and can even have a laugh about it, you may begin to change their minds. Gotta remember there's still places out there that will still kill you for being gay, you really think people from there are gonna care about what pronoun you like being called",

They/them would be actually nice, partly because they you wouldn't have to know ones gender when referring to them. Xie/xer is not really used by anybody in reality.",

It's a psychological disorder that I'm sure I don't need to tell you is called gender dysphoria. This usually requires a diagnosis, as there are people who think they are dysphoric when in reality they like to crossdress, have a fetish, or just don't fit gender role stereotypes. These things are not dysphoria and are largely a bi-product of gender role stereotypes as a whole. Example, someone saying they're trans because they like watching romance instead of action movies.\n\nThe \"born into the wrong body\" is valid for people who are clinically dysphoric, as they genuinely and believe and have the delusion that they are a man/woman and some divine mistake caused a mix up. \n\nIf you'd like to discuss more and give me more of your viewpoints, or are interested in hearing mine or having more civil discussion I welcome you in my DM where we can discuss the topic more.",

While your own perception is your own reality, the reality that everyone else experiences says that you are this OR that. \n\nSo, by wishing someone to refer to you as they/them, you're asking them to deny the reality that we are all singular people, with 99.99% having a physical and observable difference between them. \n\nThis ideology pushed by \"nb\" and \"self diagnosed trans\" is extremely harmful to the original goals of reducing the impact of gender stereotypes, LGBT acceptance, and women's rights and safe places. \n\nTheres plenty more but we should take to DMs if you want to continue hearing my views about it, or want to share your views with me.

Yet, throughout my life, I've had people insist that I don't use those terms to address them. In reality, sir or ma'am were appropriate based on their gender and status, yet the polite thing was to respect their wishes.\n\nSo to me it's not a worry that I'm perpetuating a delusion, it's choosing to show someone basic human respect. We refer to each other by all kinds of random shit and our language constantly evolves. It's not my place to judge how someone looks and then decide what they should be called. That's a supreme level of arrogance.\n\nSure, young people online can be obnoxious about it, but that's just part of being young. Your average trans or NB person just wants to live their life with basic dignity. Ironically enough, biological women who are not \"traditionally feminine\" have started receiving harassment from TERFs and transphobes assuming they are trans. They're now gatekeeping womanhood based solely on perception of femininity.",

You arent some generic person, you are SetRevolutionary2967 yet I would still refer to you as they. Gender is nearly always irrelevant so that is also invalid. I'd struggle to find a time when it mattered honestly (remember gender and sex are 2 different things). That only leaves the difference in it being known versus unknown. But you dont know what gender a person is without asking them at which point they would give you either he, she, or they making this point also invalid as you are choosing to ignore it if they tell you the third option there.",

      "text": "My sister's friend is non binary and I just call them by their name most of the time, the other time it's when I'm talking about them when they they aren't there. It gets a little weird when i am talking about them and their boyfriend who is and identifies as male because they and him sometimes are referred together or separately in conversation. So for example if I am talking about them i would say oh they and her boyfriend went to the park yesterday and they had a picnic. they didn't like the salad that they brought but in the end they finished the dessert that they packed. Unfortunately, since I was talking about all three and English doesn't have a context clues system set up for neutral pronouns this sentence makes no sense. I prefer if they used anything else but they/them pronouns. I wonder how linguistics people feel about this debate. \n\nMoral of the story, please use ze/Zim/zer because it removes a lot of confusion when referring you in the third person.\n\nEdit: or anything else except they.",

You're Modifying Language you don't like and Changing it so that eople Think a Certain way through using certain words.\n\nI'm not trying to \"Misgender\" someone, I'm against the Modern Re-Arranging of Language to Suit your Politically Correct Bullshit.\n\nForced Speach has ALWAYS been UNCONSTITUTIONNAL.\n\nYou can't FORCE people to use Words or Pronouns they don't want to. You can't force people to change the way they speek to accomodate every single person or denomonation on this planet.\n\nThe Simple FACT that people put their pronouns in theur Twitter Bio is the exact example of bullshit we don't need in the Political Space.\n\nBut please, keep pushing your irrelevant intolerant \"ulta-progressive\" stupid Linguistic Tyranny Bullshit onto peopl who simlply want to live a normal life.\n\nI'm french. I can speak english. I will use HER and HIM prnouns and no other because that's how I was brought up and educated.\n\nYOU can use any prnouns you fucking wish to, but don't come onto other to FORCE them to use this stupid bullshit fake-language\n\nAnd you can't even argue against this without using the appropriate Logical Fallacy to make your point. \n\nLet's see you articulate any idea past these Principals of Liberalism, Feedom of Expression, Freedom of Thougth and so on.",

I'm in the Lib Left Quadrant of Political Compass, but yes, assume more, please.\n\nAnd Yes, I specifically chose this Name because Leftists can't Take a Joke or Make Fun of Themselves, which is the reason why The Left Can't Meme. If you take everything too seriously then you can't make gfun of anything ,especially not yourself since you are \"virtuous\" and so without SelfDeprication, you can't make good humour. Hence \"The Left Can't Take a Joke\" and \"The Left Can't Meme'.\n\nWhich is funny considering I'm a Leftist. This Attrocious Leftist Grammar. I'm on the same side as you, theoretically. So this just turned itself into a Self-Burn. Ouch friend, a little irony to bite you in the ass?

Have given them examples of girls who skateboard in the middle east, women who are the best markspersons in the world, how pink was a boys color, etc...\n\nThey can be whatever they want to be when they grow up. \n\nKeyterm is \"grow up.\"\n\nWeird how I'm betting you are insulted that I may be the kind of person who forces you into an identity that you don't agree with but... look at you now... incorrectly assuming and telling me what I am in bad faith and baiting people. \n\nHypocrite much?",

Masculine words can and are used in primarily gender-neutral conversations and conversations where the topic is male. It's just the default.\n\nThat doesn't mean we can ignore people's pronouns.
