I went to one of their clinics, and they literally kept pushing back my abortion date until I couldn't have one any more. When they finally scheduled me for one, I was 18 weeks pregnant. I went in when i found out i was pregnant at 6 weeks. And that's how I ended up homeless with a toddler and a newborn.",

Took me a long time to get where I am today and I'm still not where my peers are financially at my age because of the struggle of my late teens/ early 20s. I'm not upset now, but I was when I was going through it. But, my boys are my world now and while there are some days when I wish I wasn't a parent, most days I love it. Honestly, my kids are what I needed at the time. I do suffer from depression and a lot of the time they're what gets me out of bed in the morning. Knowing that someone needs me to provide for them, pushes me to be better.",

It took several months to get insurance started, and the pregnancy seemed to be going pretty normally, so we didn't have much prenatal care until I want to say 6 months. I do remember the OB mentioning that she looked a little small. She didn't seem concerned though. I don't remember being worried about it at that point.\n\nThe CPC did an ultrasound. I don't know why everyone thinks all these places are obvious. This one looked like a legit doctor's office. A person in a lab coat did the ultrasound in a clean, modern looking medical room. No one mentioned Jesus.\n\nThey gave us ultrasound pictures, and two documents, one for the state insurance provider, and one that was I think a referral to a county clinic. They told us verbally that she was 12 weeks, and both documents also had that information.\n\nI think I remember they induced because she was leaking amniotic fluid at an alarming rate. They figured it was close enough to time that they induced. Had we been able to access prenatal care earlier in the pregnancy, that date would have probably been revised, and they probably would do whatever they do to remedy a leaky amniotic sac.\n\nI imagine that normally for insured people and non-Americans, after a positive home test, a woman simply makes an appointment with an OB within her healthcare network. The first appointment would be confirming the pregnancy and estimating a due date, and care would begin there.\n\nNo one with insurance goes to these places. Theoretically in most states that have public healthcare, You take the official proof of pregnancy these places provide and apply for insurance. Then you jump through absurd hoops, get denied and have to appeal and reapply several times, and eventually have limited insurance coverage. It doesn't cover much, but it covers pregnancy, and there are no copays. This process can take months. I remember the midwife saying that some of her patients that went that route didn't have coverage approved until just before delivery. We were pretty close, but shouldn't have been.",

There are also stories of some shady stuff like providing fake ultrasound images to make it look like the fetus is further along.  \n\n\nThat pretty much tells me who the good guys are.   If you have to hard sell your service and use trickery or intentionally misleading information in the process, something is very wrong with what you are trying to do.\n\nThe only \"agenda\" that should be involved is providing a woman with her choices and supporting HER choice.",

I think having it legal allows people to abuse it but if we make it illegal I'm sure the infant and adult deaths would skyrocket to highs not seen before.\n\nDesperate people make Desperate choices that might put the infant in a situation to suffer a worse fate. Do I want to see a child die? The answer is obviously no but kids die everyday and suffer more than they should.\n\nTo be on either for it or against it is a hard stance to take, I'm not a female so I don't or won't ever truly understand the choice. Making a stance on the matter either way, well I see where both side are coming from.\n\nWhile some people on either side have I'll intentions the same can't be said for them all. Some people are against it because they love all life and don't want to see it end, while those for it understand a mother's situation or a father's situation and can understand the options they have and the choice they must make. \n \nIts truly sad to see the human condition and the way somethings have to play out and while I wish the answer was simple, it really isn't that simple. Not all situations end in warm fuzziness and unfortunately certain decisions must be made in the best interest of the parent and child. It's hard to know what that is sometimes and it's a crippling choice more often than not.",
