  "text": "My lack of religious beliefs was used against me in family court\nYesterday, my soon-to-be ex-wife and I had our first interim family court custody hearing. My ex had custody of our 15 year old son last year over the winter holiday break. I was asking for the same amount of time this year. When her lawyer cross-examined me, she started by asking me what my religion is. I responded stating I wasn't sure how that was relevant. She switched to asking me if I celebrate Christmas. Obviously I don't, I'm agnostic. The hearing officer admonished me for being agnostic and wanting equal custody time with my son. \n\nIt should be noted that my soon-to-be ex-wife had an affair, which is why we are ending a 16 year marriage. \n\nIs it legal to use my non-religious beliefs against me in a holiday custody dispute?\n\n**edit** \n\n* I only requested the custody hearing because my son has told his mom and myself that he wants to spend the break with me, since he spent the last one with her.  She lied about this point in the hearing and stated that our son doesn't want to spend any holidays with me.\n\n* I have a lawyer and she was precent\n\n* It will take another 10-12 months before the courts will hear my son's opinion on this\n\n* I understand my usage of \"obviously\" was poor.  I was under an immense amount of pressure at the time.  I do not celebrate Christmas in any way, shape or form.  This doesn't mean I don't like spending the winter break doing stuff with my kiddo.",

Parents divorced, mother a religious nutcase not doing recommended physical therapy and stretching exercises and other medical interventions saying preacher gave the child a blessing and that was all he needed.  Long custody battle ensued, court appointed attorney for this now 14 year old as his advocate.  Turns out attorney was an ex-nurse who was not going to let a doctor tell her anything and she hid medical information and mothers   Noncompliance from the judge.  She threatened me with all sorts of legal actions when I tried to get around her to present legitimate medical evidence to the judge.  Turns out it\u2019s not what you know but who you know.  I happened to also take care of our county\u2019s District Attorney\u2019s children and the head of CPSs children for over 20 years.  One simple phone call and the entire case was yanked in 24 hours from family court to juvenile court.  Judge reviewed my chart and mother\u2019s reported bizarre behavior and in less than 1 hour removed all mother\u2019s parental rights. I later learned that our Family Court was a good ole boy network between the judges and attorneys on both sides, and their underlying premise they operated on was that two parents are better than one, even if one is batshit crazy, ignoring life saving medical intervention.   Local judges, way too much power with no checks and balances.",

In a lot of ways, it's effectively secular humanism reified into a form of political economy.\n\nMaybe it's a religion in its own way, but the data suggests it's not a \"dumb\" religion...unlike capitalism (unless you're rich, in which case it's just an asshole religion).\n\nBesides, modern capitalism stems from religion: it's an updated version of the \"divine right of kings\" - it just replaces \"ordained by God\" with \"ordained by hard work or birthright (because reasons).\"\n\nI'd say clinging to a regressive form of political economy (without actually understanding what it is - like how many capitalism supporters have read Adam Smith or Hayek?) is more akin to religious belief than supporting a more modern one (and actually understanding it - it's the norm in socialist communities to have \"read theory\").\n\nAnother thing worth noting: capitalist nations tend to encourage religion (e.g. America), and in authoritarian capitalist countries, they often outright enforce it (e.g. Egypt). Socialist, social-democratic, and Marxist countries tend to discourage religion and have hardcore separation of church and state (e.g. the Nordics), and in authoritarian socialist/Marxist countries, they repress it (e.g. Vietnam). That says a fair bit to me about which is more modern, friendlier to atheism, and more connected to material reality.\n\nEdit: typos, added examples",

It's appropriate for a court to consider religious practices (see Gancas v Schultz, 683 A.2d 1207, 1213; Morris v Morris, 412 A.2d 139, 141).  In fact, Pa R Civ P 1915.1 defines \"legal custody\" as the right to make major decisions on behalf of the child including religious decisions. So the OPs religion is relevant insofar as it goes to whether the OP celebrates Xmas and thus whether the child will be celebrating Christmas with OP or not, because the court may find that its in the best interests of the child to continue being exposed to religious holidays. \n\nSecond, there is no preservation issue. The argument is not that asking about the OP's religion violates the first amendment. That's ridiculous. Find me one case supporting that proposition.  The only constitutional argument here is that, if the judge or JHO decides that the OP does not get custody at all because OP is agnostic, it may infringe on OPs first amendment rights because the court may be favoring the other parent's religion over OP's nonbelief.  So the challenge is not to the question, the challenge is to how the answer is utilized.  Thus preservation is only implicated if the attorney had the opportunity to make further arguments before the court but failed to raise the argument that OPs religion shouldn't affect OPs custody rights.",

I live in the UK, very few of us are religious here. We still celebrate Christmas. Why? Because it doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s fun for the kid. We make it more about Santa than some Christian BS.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be Christian to celebrate Christmas. In fact, when I was young, I literally never made the association between Christmas and Christianity - despite the name similarities. For me, Xmas was about Santa and gifts and elves and cosy family time. I have some very fond memories of it despite not knowing it\u2019s about Christianity. Maybe the judge had the idea that you were too stubborn to put your child\u2019s happiness first. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s good you stood by your beliefs, and it\u2019s ironic that she\u2019s the Christian (considering her morals are much worse, committing adultery). I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty standard, those with the dark triad use virtuous victimisation to get what they want. Meaning they say that they\u2019re a good christian and pretend to be a victim to manipulate others into feeling sorry for them.\n\nIt\u2019s sad that this is so effective :/",

Where a child is doing well under a current arrangement between parents, a court is less likely to change that particular status quo. Courts favor providing a consistent experience for children, even throughout a divorce or custody battle. Accordingly, the parent who seeks to enforce a well-functioning status quo will typically have the upper hand. A parent who is not satisfied with the current status quo custody or visitation agreement or order will have the task of demonstrating to the court why continuing the arrangement is not in the child\u2019s best interest in addition to showing that his or her alternative proposal is in the child\u2019s best interest.  ](https://www.cassandrahearn.com/blog/2018/5/status-quo-and-custody)\n\nThe link is just a family law firm ad/blog page, but that's a good, short/simple/layperson description of the concept (Source: I was a paralegal 15+ years.

If you commit a felony in front of a beat cop he can arrest you. You can be arrested for literally anything or nothing, legally or not.\n\nI went and search a bunch of news articles with your string but could not find anything that would meet my criteria. When you looked into them they were all about beatings and assaults. I could find nothing were a person was arrested and/or charged for simply violating something like free speech. I'll provide a link to a video which I think clearly shows what I'm talking about.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=721GYRlmBR4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=721GYRlmBR4)\n\nSomething like this should be treated no differently than if the cop had pulled out his gun and shot them. Actually I'd like to see it treated more seriously since cops murder people all the time and get off.\n\nI find the \"willfulness\" barrier to being considered guilty of violating constitutional rights also abhorrent. I don't have to willfully murder someone to still get arrested and possibly charged with a lesser crime. Why should someone who has harmed someone's freedom and rights be considered innocent just because they didn't willfully intent to violate their rights?\n\nI know this is just the way it is, \"the powerful protect each other\", but it honestly should be turned on its head. These are the worst possible crimes that can be committed short of pure physical violence or torture. They should be treated as such and any government official that violates someones rights should be put away for life. The crime is simply that heinous.",

You can't murder someone if you don't intentionally harm someone for the purpose of killing them without legal justification. You can't deprive someone of their civil rights if you don't intentionally use the force of the state to deprive someone of their rights using force without legal justification. \n\nIf you had a good faith belief that the guy you were aiming at someone was not loaded, then you couldn't be convicted of intentional murder for shooting and killing someone with it.

Rather a child is raised religiously and in what religion can be highly contentious and the court may need to step in some regards. And the courts are also going to favor giving a child a sense of normalcy. And there can be secular reasons to give weight to religious events. From what OP has said it sounds like during their relationship the ex-Wife would visit family during the holidays without OP, I asked if the Son went with her but I didn't get a reply. I suspect the Son did. \n\nIn this case from the Court's perspective, you have the Mother wanting custody of the Son during a period of significance to her and for an event that the Son has gone to for the last 15 years. Versus OP who directly stated that he doesn't celebrate during the period. \n\nI am an atheist and I think religion should go to Hell, but if I was the hearing officer/judge I would probably rule in the ex-Wife's favor as well based on the information we have.\n\nI also feel like it is inappropriate to give OP specific legal advice when we only know part of the story and it is coming from a biased source. If he appeals this, he is probably going to lose and just cost him money. It sucks for OP, but sometimes things in life suck, and there isn't always a legal remedy for that.",

Depending on jurisdiction:\n\n>In the context of child custody cases, \u201cstatus quo\u201d means the way parents have historically gone about caring for children, or how they have had their visitation and custody arrangement done. Where a child is doing well under a current arrangement between parents, a court is less likely to change that particular status quo. Courts favor providing a consistent experience for children, even throughout a divorce or custody battle. Accordingly, the parent who seeks to enforce a well-functioning status quo will typically have the upper hand. A parent who is not satisfied with the current status quo custody or visitation agreement or order will have the task of demonstrating to the court why continuing the arrangement is not in the child\u2019s best interest in addition to showing that his or her alternative proposal is in the child\u2019s best interest.\n\nThat was just from a family law firm ad/blog page, but the idea is all I'm getting at.",

But then again you don't have the religious pressure to get married in the first place so if the legal benefits to marriage doesn't appeal to you and your partner then by all means, don't bother getting married.",

Its a really fucked up archaic system. My ex's lawyer lied to the judge 8 times, right to his face. Nothing can be done about it. I've talked to my therapist a ton of times about this and he wanted me to focus on what I can control. This part of life is so hard my friend, Im sorry you have to go through this. You did it because of an affair, my ex was saying she was going to kill herself. The thing is where do you go from here? You have to look forward my friend. Its dark times now and going forward its going to get even worse before it gets better. But once it gets better its so good. No one stamping their feet at the water park, its just you and the kids. No more long church services, no more horrible holidays at the in-laws, no more shitty couples dinners with her friend and her husband the horrible banker. None of that. Your life will get really really good after awhile and you can make the last half of your life whatever you want.\n\nThats what I decided, I was so sad because I was going thru divorce and I was forty and I was like God dammit my life is over. But then I realized its like the merry go round. I get one big spin. And I still have half a spin left. Im doing this half my way. When I am with my kids I am really with them. I put my phone away, I run through the sprinklers, we play Monopoly until late at night, I dance around on the backdeck and put up the droplights and shoot off the fireworks. When I am not with the kids I read and travel. I've read everything Hemingway has ever written. In the last five years since my separation I've eaten hot chicken in Nashville and crawfish on Bourbon street. I caught a fish that was four foot long and I canoed on 9 different rivers. I went skinny dipping with a beautiful redhead late at night in Miami and I spent an amazing week with a beautiful Argentinian in a hotel overlooking the ocean. I swam with the pigs in the Bahamas and I outran police on a scooter in Mexico. You get to choose what your life will be now. Im doing this half of my life my way, and its been fuckin fantastic.",

However, they're also supposed to accommodate religious beliefs as much as possible.\n\nIf one parent has a religious belief that they want to impart to their child that requires custody on certain days and the other parent doesn't, that might be a legitimate facet for the courts to consider. The courts can't just ignore parents' religion/culture when making decisions like that. If two parents have conflicting religious beliefs / cultural beliefs, the courts need to balance those. If you were an agnostic that celebrated Christmas, then you might have a right to have your secular celebration of Christmas considered equal to a religious celebration of Christmas. But because you said you don't recognize or celebrate the holiday, then the courts might have legitimate reason to favor the parent whose culture does, as being with family during an important cultural holiday is clearly important to that parent but not to you.\n\nI think this is really a complicated legal issue and you'll likely need a good lawyer that specializes in this.",

A couple divorces because one of them goes deep into religious fundamentalism. And the child had been raised secularly. The fundamentalist parent wasn't to move the child to a new area and attend a strict fundamentalist school. While the other parent wants the child to continue at the current secular school. So, asking about religious practices can be relevant to the child.\n\nFamily Court often defaults toward continuity for the child. Not saying it is a perfect system but it is how it is.",

Where a child is doing well under a current arrangement between parents, a court is less likely to change that particular status quo. Courts favor providing a consistent experience for children, even throughout a divorce or custody battle. Accordingly, the parent who seeks to enforce a well-functioning status quo will typically have the upper hand.

It can be heartbreaking or trigger anger or other drama when a child says \"I want to go with mom (or dad)\" and so it can be very difficult for the child- even teens. It is really better if the adults decide and just tell the child \"I hear what you are saying but your mother and I decided that this is best and you and I will do XYZ instead\" or sometimes it has to be \"I hear what you are saying, but a judge decided XYZ, so...\" \n\nAlso what kids WANT or what they think is best often isn't- even, if not especially, teens. That's the whole point of having parents.",

It's so important that even politicians need to be christians. On the other hand Biden being catholic is seen as bad. I don't see a difference between christian sects.

When it has to go before the judge, the judge is going to make the decision that keeps the status quo (what was happening before) as much as possible.\n\nSo it isn't saying that religion makes a life stable, but that stability between the child's life before and after- so if there was religion before, the judge will making a ruling that preserves that; and theoretically the same if they were raised atheist.\n\nIf every year for 15 years mom let dad take son to his atheist anti-Xmas meet up, and now mom wanted to block it, the judge would be likely to side with dad.",

Well an important religious rite is Ash Wednesday and Easter, but it's on the atheist's half of the year.  Do you go out and say we \"celebrate Easter, Easter bunny and all\" but do you take the child to Church on Ash Wed?  Unless you're willing to do that, perhaps you can trade a few religious days on your half of the year, with a few non-religious days on her half of the year.\n\nThat's what it's about.   Not only do they have to consider the timesplit , but also the agreement to how religious rites will be conducted so the right of each parent to raise their child in their religion (or lack thereof) is not infringed.",

But, the traditional Hallmark Christmas does come at a good time, the darkest day of the year is Dec 21st, so it's nice to have a celebration to make up for the otherwise cold and dark days.

Did you insist you get your son for the holiday?\n\nI ask because the way you describe it reads as a Constitutional violation. \n\nIf, however, you are interpreting your request being denied as anti-agnosticism, those two things matter, legally in some places and some cases. \n\nObligatory this is not legal advice and I don't know your case details, so this shouldn't be seen as anything but a brushstrokes explanation. \n\nIf you don't celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday, but your child always has, and you have no intention of taking part in the religious parts of the holiday that your child always has, the Court might use that to say, okay, he will spend the religious holiday with the parent who will continue the status quo.\n\nIf you were denied Christmas Eve/Day but can get other days (New Years), that might be what thats about.\n\nThe status quo rule goes both ways. I've had courts deny a divorced parent the ability to take a kid to their new pentecostal church because the parents were nonpracticing atheists and religion was never part of kids life.",

The unknowns are shrinking as fast as ever, and many current mysteries are still mysteries only because of known technical limitations -- or physical limitations of the properties of light and matter.  More on this below.  \n\n>What caused the Big Bang? What existed before the big bang? Was it nothing? Is nothingness something? lol\n\nOur knowledge of the the Big Bang is limited because of the nature of the event.  We can't see 'past' it into the deeper past because everything within ~14 billion lightyears of our current vantage point in the universe is a product of the Big Bang itself.  \n\nThat said, nothing about the Big Bang or its aftermath suggests that any kind of supernatural being was involved or responsible.  \n\nIn general, suggesting that unexplained natural events are the result of divine intervention is pushing a \"[god of the gaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps).\"  God used to be 'responsible' for all natural events, but his duties have slowly been whittled away, and he has now been relegated to the few still-unexplained natural phenomena scientists are zeroing in on.  \n\nAnd I'm sure once astrophysicists can reasonably explain the Big Bang, you'll come up with some new thing a hypothetical god could be responsible for.  That's just how that line of reasoning works.  \n\n>95% of the universe is dark matter and dark energy. The smartest people in the world have no idea what it is, what it does, where it came from, or anything about it.  It hasn't even been directly observed, it's still just hypothetical.\n\n...And?  We didn't know how *lightning* worked 350 years ago.  You could sit back and say \"maybe it's god\" or you could try to *understand it*.  Just look at how far we've come since the bible was written.  People back then experienced a flood and explained it by claiming that \"god was angry at them\" and then made up a crackpot story about two of every animal getting on a boat.  They didn't know about *fossils* or geologic time at the time, though, so the story didn't really hold up.   \n\n2,000 years later, and we understand meteorology, weather patterns, can predict flooding, etc.  To say nothing of biology and evolution.  And you're claiming that a few remaining unexplained areas of astrophysics leave room for the existence of a supernatural being...\n\n>At this point, I'd say that we don't know most things about the universe.\n\nNot so much.  We actually have a pretty good understanding of the [Big Bang's immediate aftermath](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ae/cf/f1/aecff100798f0cbea90946a7534d2dc1.jpg) thanks to experiments being conducted at modern particle accelerators ([2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x42fbMT9h8c)).  I'm probably somewhat biased because my research is in a related field, but you're throwing most of modern astronomy, astrophysics, and geology under the bus with a dismissive statement like that.  We understand the aftermath of the Big Bang, we understand star, galaxy, and planet formation.  Most odd astronomical discoveries today seem to involve unusual and dying stars interacting with planets and stars -- things like [polluted white dwarfs](https://www.inverse.com/science/how-polluted-white-dwarfs-expanded-what-exoplanets-are-possible).  \n\nWe know plenty about the universe.  Our primary limitation is simply time / space / distance.  When the nearest star is 4.35 lightyears away, you're looking at a travel time of ~118,000 years, at maximum Apollo mission speeds.  So we've got to do most of our observing from Earth / our Solar System.  That's just the way it goes.  \n\nNow, you're suggesting that a supernatural being is not just covering distances like that, but is also observing everything (?) in the universe (?) and interacting with it (?).  And reading peoples' minds / prayers (?).  \n\nIt's one thing to say that, formally, logically, one can't disprove the existence of a god.  But if you have even a rudimentary understanding of our universe, the idea is preposterous.  You might as well claim that there's a dinosaur colony living on the far side of the Moon.  Except that would be far more probable than the existence of anything resembling a Judeo-Christian (or Pagan, or any other) god.",

[100 years ago, we didn't understand what *galaxies* were, or that there was a universe beyond our then crude observations of the Milky Way](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/astronomy/chapter/the-discovery-of-galaxies/).  Before the 1920s, we knew *nothing* about the rest of the universe beyond a very basic understanding of gravity, and the visible planets and a dozen or so large asteroids in our Solar System.  \n\nEven the discovery of Pluto -- a Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) -- was a statistical fluke that had ~no chance of happening for an additional ~100 years.  Eris, the next KBO identified, is just as large and [was only discovered in 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt), with modern telescopes and technology.  We didn't even know the Kuiper Belt existed until then.  Some scientists thought it might be there due to observations of distant young stars and computer modeling, but proving they were there was extremely difficult.  That's *in our Solar System.*   \n\nIn 100 years, we've gone from knowing ~nothing, to knowing that our Solar System is a mix of material from [several dying stars, from a dense, star forming region of the Milky Way](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4337342/).   Hell, even the discovery that there are different types of stars is relatively new, and we only just caught a well-documented supernova, that we know the mass of,  for the first time....ever.  [Last March](https://www.space.com/doomed-star-rosetta-stone-of-supernovas-hubble-photo).   \n\n>So, was it completely random? What caused it to happen? Nothing? Nothing caused the creation of the universe?\n\nThe Big Bang wasn't the creation of the universe.  It was simply when the observable universe started expanding into what we can see in the present.  \n\nHere's a question for you: What 'powers' the Sun and other stars? [Not coal?  Not the Sun thermodynamically contracting?  Not infalling meteorites?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02834.pdf)  \n\nSince a theory of atomic fusion was put forth in 1926, and we now understand how it happens in stars, all of that energy probably isn't coming from *god,* right?  Or is it?  \n\nThe Big Bang is just one similar problem we've only started to tackle.  The Cosmic Microwave Background was only discovered around 50 years ago, and it's *very difficult* to see 14 billion years into the past, even using modern technology.  And modern particle accelerators [are making leaps and bounds every year](https://home.cern/news/news/physics/twice-charm-long-lived-exotic-particle-discovered), probing the very nature of matter.  \n\n>I'm atheist lol\n\nAtheists don't usually quote multiple historic, fallacious arguments for the existence of god.  \n\n*That's* something I can't explain.  \n\n>I haven't said god is responsible for anything, I said there's still quite a lot that we have no explanation for, and science is currently unable to explain.\n\nYes, you did say that.  You haven't backed that claim up with anything other than \"We don't understand what triggered the Big Bang yet.\"  \n\nThe gaps in human knowledge that a hypothetical god could occupy are rapidly disappearing, and have all but closed in the last century alone.  \n\n>And, we can't (currently) disprove the existence of god, even if I don't personally believe in the existence of one.\n\nUsing the rules of formal logic, no -- the same way that you can't disprove the existence of my [trolls](https://i.imgur.com/ZDFsVlP_d.webp?maxwidth=1520&fidelity=grand) that appear behind closed doors whenever an observer is not present.  \n\nIn the same way that you cannot disprove the existence of the [Invisible Pink Unicorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn), or the [Flying Spaghetti Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster).  \n\n>A few? They're pretty big questions, like, you know, the creation of the universe, \n\nWe generally understand that.  We understand the particle physics that occurred even microseconds after the Big Bang, and all of the ensuing reactions.  This new problem is truly analogous to our gradual understanding of the source of stellar energy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  We've made leaps and bounds in understanding fundamental particles in recent years.  We're getting there.  \n\nEither way, the assumption that a living, sentient entity existed somehow before / during / after the Big Bang is far less likely than the event happening spontaneously.  If you're going to invoke a supernatural being, I'd point out that any similar being must have come from *somewhere.*  \n\nThe \"logic\" you're trying to use here is backwards.  If energy and matter couldn't have always existed, why should a living organism have come first?  Where would *it* have come from?  What god(s) created *it?*\n\n>the Earth, \n\nWe know ~exactly how Earth formed. We also know that Earth-like planets couldn't have existed in the first several billion years of the universe, because not enough heavy elements were made in the universe's first, supermassive stars.  More on this [here](https://www.science.org/content/article/some-universe-s-heavier-elements-are-created-neutron-star-collisions) and [here](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html).  \n\n>humanity, etc.\n\nThe human / hominid / primate fossil record is one of the best documented examples of evolution ([1](https://australian.museum/learn/science/human-evolution/a-timeline-of-fossil-discoveries/)) ([2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_evolution_fossils)) ([3)](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/essential-timeline-understanding-evolution-homo-sapiens-180976807/).  Largely because people have put so much effort into understanding our own origins.  \n\n>Like, why haven't we discovered any other life in the universe? Are we the only ones?\n\nIn theory, you already checked out the above link about the Fermi Paradox.  I'm going to include it again [here](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html).  If you read no other sources in this comment, I would recommend checking that one out and reading the whole article.  It's good.  \n\n>Was it just a coincidence that Earth was the perfect distance from the sun to support life?\n\nIt isn't.  Mars and Venus are \"just as good,\" but their atmospheres went to crap.  Mars in particular is farther from the Sun, so it's going to be inhabitable for significantly longer than the Earth, when the Sun enters its red giant phase.  [And then the Jovian moons, etc.](https://eos.org/articles/aging-stars-make-new-habitable-zones)  \n\n>I don't know the answers, and I don't pretend to.\n\nYou could actually learn the answers to many of the questions you just posed.  People know them...  You might consider auditing an introductory college course on astronomy if you find things like this interesting.",

Unless op tells the judge that the specific plans they have and the fact that kid is interested in them the judge is doing what is best for the kid which is celebrating a holiday that is celebrated by majority of the country, most kids in their school and the kid has celebrated for some time.

It's like how it's fun to think about monsters during Halloween, it's fun to think about hope and love and joy and peace and good will towards men during Christmas.

It's a holiday that happens every year. It's a time to go hang out with your family and give them gifts and receive gifts from them. It's definitely arbitrary (but no less than anything else humans do for culture) but it's not random.",

Like say the mother of my child is Muslim and I specifically ask for custody on Eid, do you suppose I might get \"admonished\" when I admit I don't even celebrate? I suspect I might. And there's no way it's some sort of persecution, it's me looking like petty dickhead in court. \n\n\n\nI don't trust any vague detail less recounts of court. Everyone who's in the wrong always lies by omission by including weasel words like admonished or insulted or whatever. It's 100% of the time. Meanwhile op will post updates in the future about how no law firm will represent me and the admonished me can I sue etc and r/atheism will always be like \"well obviously this won't stand up to the supreme court, start a petition to get the judge deported to prison\"",

This is why my father lost custody of my brother when I was young.  \n\nThe courts allowed anyone 13 or older (me) to choose which parent to live with, regardless of the court's decision regarding any other children. \n\nIt took a few months, and in-home visits and interviews with a children's advocate, to make it all official, but I got to see my brother very often, and the ferrying me back and forth meant my dad got to see my brother for 10-15 minute chunks almost every day.  \n\nThis was 30+ years ago, so I dont know how mucj has changed or how much of that was simply state based.  \n\nGood luck, and don't lose hope. \n\nWorst case scenario: 15 is very close to 18, and then you get to see them as much as he wants.",

First, lots of agnostic people, even athiests, celebrate christmas as a secular holiday.\n\nIt *does* make sense that if the child typically celebrates christmas, then the custody court would give the christmas break to the parent who celebrates over the one who doesn't. The courts try to keep things as stable for the child as possible.\n\nYou certainly should get EQUAL time (if your custody agreement is 50/50 or equal vacation/break time), but your ex can probably argue for winter break as well as any other christian holiday and as long as it doesn't change the % custody time, the judge would likely approve it. \n\nCustody isn't about the parent's rights as much as the child's best interest. If you can work something out civilly with your ex, great, if not, you are at the mercy of the court.",

Never been happier. \n\nBut my wife's ex tried to make it look to us like we were a bunch of heathens. Sent us documents of him stalking us online, showed my wife drinking in bed (oh what a crime) and accused me of having gay sex with colleagues in secret (again, how horrific). \n\nNever did anything official with it, just sent us bunch of fake documents. But on adoption day, in which he was able to show up, I was suspicious he was going to say something about our family atheism. Thankfully, he didn't do or say anything about it to the judge.\n\nBut my state is a *de facto* theocracy (we have it [on the books](https://tennesseelookout.com/2021/06/13/why-it-matters-that-7-states-still-have-bans-on-atheists-holding-office/) that atheists can't hold public office) which means our judge was almost certainly a Christian. My wife's ex was a republican and a manipulator. He could've easily tried to leverage that against us; even though the judge likely wouldn't have discriminated against us on that basis due to the 1st amendment, the ex could've still made a scene out of it and to make us all look bad in front of the judge.\n\nI'm so sorry this happened to you, and in a family court of all things.",

I know that the mutual dislike between her family and myself was not pleasant for her.  I never complained to her when she chose to spend time with them instead of with me.  She also never complained about me refusing to speak to them.  I thought we had a workable solution.  The first time I found out we didn't was when she told me she was having an affair with my best friend and wanted a divorce.  Before that day, we never fought about anything.  Spent tons of time together.  We've traveled to over 30 countries together, lived aboard........we had a really, really good life.\n\nI'm surprised she didn't talk to me that she wanted things to change between her family and I.  It was easier for her to have an exit affair and then blame it all on me.",

However, maintaining the parental rights to custody is only part of what the court is responsible for, oftentimes the court acts as a referee to best preserve the rights and safety of the child.  Typically until you've negotiated your agreed upon terms of custody in divorce, most court systems seek to preserve continuity for your children.  So if your son is 15 and has celebrated Christmas each year of his life thus far, it is really difficult to change that unless both parents are in agreement.  It is definitely worth your time to make sure your feelings on that are addressed through your counsel, but at least where I live, I've seen preservation of continuity be the real tie breaker when nothing else justifies the change well.  For example, one of my friends can't have her kids during spring break because their dads parents took the kids to Arizona every year for the past decade.  When she argued for every other year, he argued that he should be able to keep that because of family tradition and her lawyer just said it's way better to bargain for something else.  The worry was that her desire might be misconstrued as a petty attempt to break up a healthy family tradition.",

Those specific days are special for your ex and son, so it makes sense that they can be together.\n\nIf you were a Jehovah's Witness who didn't celebrate birthdays, it wouldn't be fair to force your kid to spend half his birthdays with you instead of celebrating with his mom.\n\nMy wife and I are both atheists and we celebrate Christmas and Easter, as do my atheist in-laws and several friends.

Depending on how old the kid is, who would believe a child doesn't want to exchange gifts? Hell I'm 32 years old and I still get giddy on Christmas morning to share the feeling of giving with friends.\n\nThere are factors here outside of the religious context of this family hearing. Don't pin yourself as a victim due to being agnostic since this is more about your relationship with your child. \n\nEven hearing from children directly on these matters in court is sketchy since they can be coerced into swaying one way or another. If he's older (teens) then he can be a verifiable witness on the matter. \n\nGood luck with the situation. If you don't mind me asking, what makes you not want to celebrate the holiday to any length? I still celebrate the spirit of giving outside of Religious context, so I'm curious to hear other points of view.",

The judge can take *everything* into account when deciding on custody, and if a non-religious parent will cause some conflict or unhappiness in the child's life, that can affect custody. It can definitely affect it when deciding who gets holidays with the kid - why would he give you Christmas with him if you don't celebrate it?  \n\nThere are many, many cases where a judge has ruled that a child's best interests involve staying with a religious parent and limiting the other parent's custody - and it has nothing to do with whether the judge personally believes in God.  There are other things that come into play, like community support, extended family, education, etc.  And having an affair does not automatically mean your wife is unfit to take care of her children.\n\nYour lawyer should be more responsive to you, but it's not uncommon that divorce lawyers suck and don't give their clients the impression they're treating these cases like the most important things on earth - which to you, they are.  If she doesn't respond to you, go to the partner above her.  And if that doesn't work, find another attorney, but realize that sometimes you have to fucking force them to do things.  It sucks, but that's the way it is, and the sooner you take that into account and act accordingly, the better off you'll be.",

And it's worth less than two cents due to inflation so take it as you will.\n\nThe family court system is not about justice, it's about expedience. Don't EVER fool yourself into thinking that system is about what's best, honest, fair, healthy, or any of that stuff they claim to center their work around.  They don't give a rat's ass if someone is lying or makes improper implications about religion.  They want it easy and it's always easiest to repeat what was done in the past.  In some areas of the USA it is still easiest to give the Mother the benefit of the doubt and as having some special magical parenting super-power which males cannot possess--but that old idiocy is fast going away in many areas and it is much more fair than previous so that may not be a real issue at all in your area.\n\nComplain about bad rulings via the available channels and instead of benefitting, you will usually just be labeled as a problematic kook and have to wear that every time in the future you deal with them. That lawyer is expensive also for small chance of good results.\n\nSo--if you can provide actual written proof that she lied which was created before the hearing, maybe it's worth pursuing.  That is likely hard and often what you see as \"proof\" can be easily weaseled out from under with a simple excuse.  Ronald Reagan said \"I don't recall\" 88 times in much more important testimony and was able to weasel out from under his mal-deeds..so don't think this one will be easier with less proof.  OR if you can provide a written transcript that the system unquestioningly discriminated against you religiously and **agregiously** (not slightly with little affect) maybe that'll work.\n\nDO always take the high road.  Work on strengthening your relationship with your son in spite of these setbacks because in 3 years, HE has the choice.  That 3 years will go quickly.  Focus on the long game, not the short game.\n\nHe's 15--also take the time to be glad he doesn't hate your guts, simply because most teenagers hate their parents with a passion.",

If your kid\u2019s momma doesn\u2019t want you in your kid\u2019s life and she\u2019s not a complete screw up, I think the only way to win some sort of custody in the family court system is simply to have a large income that can afford you to continue to take the blows. I personally spent over 60 hours in court, not including the prep work out of court that my lawyer accrued, over the span of 1 year simply for a provisional order that stated that I had to take a bunch of tests, all of which cost money. During which time I had to pay for supervised visitation. I have 3 speeding tickets on my record. That\u2019s it. Passed a hair follicle test, passed the psychological valuation. My income fell by 1/3 due to market conditions that were out of my control. I began to borrow money to pay off my mortgage and pay my lawyer fees. I Survived a winter with my house at 57 degrees F, the maximum temperature required to pay the minimum amount required for my utility bill. I canceled my internet and cable subscriptions. I stopped driving unless I had to. I began to cut back on food. After passing the psychological evaluation I had my lawyer contact hers and plead with them to allow me some parenting time. She refused. The last time I saw my son was at a half hour long supervised visitation. Our last exchange was \u201cdad when are you coming home?.\u201d \n\u201cthat\u2019s a complicated question. Just know that I love you.\u201d  I said as I gave my son a big hug knowing that it would be the last time I saw him maybe ever.\nHe was already calling her parent\u2019s house \u201chome.\u201d  Get this: i was never accused of abuse of either my kid or my ex. The accusation was that I was in psychosis which was false and proven false by the psychological evaluation.  Money. All it takes is enough money to withstand the storm. During my provisional hearing I sat next to a divorce lawyer while getting a hair cut. I overheard a conversation he was having with his stylist. He said \u201ca successful divorce takes at least 5 years, success determined by my total pay.\u201d",

And then, if there\u2019s nothing special or important about that time of year, I suggest just asking for the same amount of time, at a different time of the year. This looks good on you as well because obviously Christmas is an important time of the year for mom, so if you\u2019re willing to be \u201creasonable\u201d with this, the judge will take that into account when you\u2019re asking for something else in the future.",

Of course the attorney was bating you to get you to loose your cool!!\n\nBut if you want a firm response while on the stand, you can reply\u2026. That you do not teach your children morality based on dogma because we live in a free society.  I educate my kids to base their moral decisions on compassion AND the evidence.  This way we do not let confirmation bias or implicit bias lead us to reach an immoral decision based on religious dogma.  They want to paint you as an immoral person.  This gives you the chance to egg the attorney who tries superficial family cases relying on the ONLY tactic they have and NOT because they\u2019re a good attorney!\n\nAnytime you get the religion question in court, as I was coached for depositions, is to answer that it is NOT a yes or no answer.  The reason you say that is because they want the cheap opportunity to establish a weak assumption that those without religion are immoral people incapable of making moral decisions for your children.  It gives you a chance to establish moral superiority because your morality is set and doesn\u2019t fluctuate as religious myth and dogma does.  To say it politely, it gives a chance to shut the Christian mother fucker\u2019s hypocritical shit down, and fast.  I bet he has to pivot on his cross examination.",

The judge let me defend myself. Dunno if that is normal but while I didn't win the custody arrangement I did get as much time as we could possibly get. Pretty much anytime my daughter wasn't in school.\n\nIt worked out alright. Stay hopeful and remember that being angry only translates to your kid that he is the cause of negative emotions. It's hard and you won't be perfect but just do the best you can. Good luck.",

Christmas is weird because it\u2019s so secular now but it\u2019s still on some level a religious holiday.  But also it\u2019s when many people are off work and have more time with kids.

      "text": "> She switched to asking me if I celebrate Christmas. Obviously I don't, I'm agnostic.\n\n*Obviously*??? That's a total non sequitur. The Christmas tree and gift giving have nothing to do with Christianity; that's why Christians moan about how secular Christmas is. You don't have to believe in anything to do the tree and gifts. No doubt your son would like that. Do you have a tradition of tree + gifts in your soon-to-be-ex family?\n\nI had a *Jewish* friend growing up whose family did the tree and gifts. Why? So their kids would have fun and wouldn't feel like they were weird.\n\n> It should be noted that my soon-to-be ex-wife had an affair, which is why we are ending a 16 year marriage.\n\nWhy do you think that's relevant to anything? It's not, at least it's not in US family courts.\n\n> I only requested the custody hearing because my son has told his mom and myself that he wants to spend the break with me, since he spent the last one with her. She lied about this point in the hearing and stated that our son doesn't want to spend any holidays with me.\n\nYou don't know if she lied. Your son could have told her that he does NOT want to spend Christmas with you. Children feel a lot of pressure to please their parents. Your son could be telling both of you want you want to hear. Your son could be lying to you when he says he wants to be with *you* over the holidays.\n\nI don't know where you are, but at age 15 many courts are willing to put kids on the stand. If your court isn't, or your son doesn't want to testify, then the usual device is to have a guardian ad litem (GAL, someone who advocates for the child) interview the child and then testify to court about the child's preferences. If your son really wants to avoid disappointing both of his parents, he might tell the GAL \"I don't know.\"\n\nAgain, in the US as I understand it: the court *listens* to the preferences of a 15-year-old child, so you should win the custodial time if your son genuinely wants to spend it with you and that preference is credibly communicated to the court.\n\nGood luck.",

              "text": "> He asked for the cash.\n\nTo me that's sad. I happen to be divorced and have a 15-year-old son. I get a great deal of pleasure from figuring out what gifts might please him, and when I guess right, seeing his eyes light up and his huge smile break out on Christmas morning. It probably won't arrive on time because of the chip shortage, but last week I ordered a gaming computer for him that's scheduled to arrive on 12/21. *Whenever* it arrives, he'll be very happy. I could of course write him a check in the amount that the computer cost. That requires zero imagination, thought, or effort. He would understand that, if I handed him a check. That's why it's a clich\u00e9 in the movies and TV shows, the rich parent giving the kid money for his birthday or Christmas and the kid feeling neglected. The rich parent won't put time and work into shopping for their child.\n\n> I shouldn't have to pretend to enjoy holidays simply to be able to spend an equal amount of time with my son.\n\nThis makes me sad for you too. The holidays are the most wonderful time of the year, as the song goes. The fact that you would have to *pretend* to enjoy them... Well, I'll stop, I should not be judging you.\n\nI totally agree that you should get the custodial time *simply because that's fair*. Divorced parents should take turns.\n\nI don't think it's best for your son, though, that he has to spend the entire holiday with one parent and not see the other at all. IMO it's best for the child if the holiday time is split 50/50. My ex and I celebrate Christmas together at her home every year because that way my son can be with all of his immediate family including his two half-brothers from his mother's first marriage. Another convention is dividing Christmas Day, with one parent having the child until noon, that privilege alternating every year. If you are steadfast about refusing to celebrate Christmas, then let him be with his mother the whole day! He'll appreciate that.\n\nIf I were you, if you get the custodial time it would be great for your relationship if you did something really fun with your son over the holidays. If you can afford it (and it's not too late to book flights and a motel), you could fly to Orlando, FL and spend a few days at Universal Studios (and/or DisneyWorld if you can swing the cash). I did that about 4 years ago with my then 11- and 25-year-old sons. Or if you like to hike, fly to Utah and tour the amazing state and federal parks, something else we did. Make memories while you still can.\n\nIf you win the custodial time, don't waste it at home doing the usual -- being self-satisfied because you're angry at your soon-to-be-ex and this time you *won*. I don't know if he's college bound. If he is, your son is just a few years away from exiting your life. That's how it worked with my older son: our annual time together was reduced by 95% when he started college away from home. That's what I keep in mind with my 15-year-old.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit: The court will see you as *reasonable* and be much more disposed to accommodate you if you propose an equal division of the holiday time and specify that you would alternate privileges like Christmas morning and having the option to take him away on vacation for a week. The court will recognize that 50/50 plan as best for your son, and perceive you as the parent acting in your son's best interest. Your soon-to-be-ex's selfish attempt to hog all of his time will be seen as just that, if you propose a schedule that divides the holiday time equally. Has your attorney suggested this approach? If not, you need a new attorney.",

When I identify 3-4 candidates, I'll email his mother and his brothers. \"Do you already have XYZ game?\" Sometimes they do.

This is pretty standard stuff. The Jewish parent gets the kids on Rosh Hashanah, the Christian parent gets them on Christmas. Courts make custody decisions like that all the time, and it\u2019s not unconstitutional, because it\u2019s in the child\u2019s best interests to have a robust relationship with *both* religious communities. In this case, it\u2019s not like December 25th is Anti-Christmas for atheists and the kid should be exposed to both celebrations. It makes sense to prioritize the parent for whom that day is incredibly meaningful over the parent for whom it\u2019s just another Thursday, since denying the kid Christmas celebrations could damage or stunt his relationship with his religion or religious community and there\u2019s no clear benefit to the child for OP to have that specific day.",

While courts *shouldn\u2019t* take into consideration which parent makes things easier for them, they still do it all the time and it\u2019s hard to prove they\u2019re siding with someone because the other party\u2019s abrasive personality makes things difficult for the court or if it\u2019s because they just trusted that other party\u2019s answers and intentions less. \n\nIn other words, put on your \u201ccustomer service\u201d smile and tone of voice, like these mediators are doing you a favor (even when things get a little uncomfortable), and they might actually do just that. Put on your \u201cangry customer\u201d hat, and prepare to feel the full wrath of the bureaucracy that is mediation.",

If you're about to be disadvantaged by stating your beliefs, especially one that has nothing to do with anybody (as you stated - it really was none of their business) - then just fucking lie. There's NO harm in pretending to be like them in order to live a normal life. What the fuck is going to happen to you? Nothing is going to happen to you, that's what. Afraid of going to hell for lying? Then I have some news for you - you AIN'T an atheist.\n\nNot that that's going to help YOU at this point - you already told the truth - bad move, you don't get to go back and change that, as bad as I bet you wish you could.\n\nSeriously - they're not playing fair so that opens the field up for all of us. \n\nHell, I'm not even religious enough to be agnostic - I don't believe in any gods or even that there's a chance, but I celebrate christmas.\n\nI hate religions because of the damage they've done by being misinterpreted by a bunch of insane assholes, but the tenets of religion are amazing - my favorite being \"the golden rule\". \n\nI really like that \"don't kill anyone\" bit, and I can see the logic behind don't fuck somebody's wife, don't steal from people, and wishing you had what someone else has to the point of sickness isn't a good idea either. \n\nGood information - shitty people screwing it up.\n\nLearn which mask to wear and when to wear it. Fuck you \"principles\" if it's going to screw you over something as non-principled as having your kid or not being attacked. Trust me, god ain't going to give a shit if you fudge it just a bit.\n\nThat is all.",

Whether one is a theist or an atheist does not depend on whether one has enough information to determine if deities exist or not \u2014 the former is a question of belief, the latter a question of knowledge.\n\nTo be super clear, if one neither believes nor disbelieves in any deity, then one is an atheist, since one does not believe in any deities.  People sometimes distinguish between \"soft\" atheism (a lack of belief) and \"hard\" atheism (disbelief) but at the end of the day both are atheism.",

Gift exchanges are not even considered religious in most cases. Sure, the wise men gave gifts, but they did not receive gifts in return. \n\nEven weddings and funerals can be done without religion. (Also, wedding rings are NOT required. Don't let jewelers deceive you.)\n\nSo, when a judge asks about holidays, you can say you do celebrate them in non-religious ways. \n\nBeing that you already stated you don't celebrate Christmas, you might benefit from consulting with a non-religious attorney.\n\nThis might help:\nhttps://www.atheists.org/legal/",

You can be agnostic and celebrate Christmas as a time to spend with family and exchange gifts and love for one another.\n\nI don't typically celebrate completely religious holidays like Good Friday, Ash Wednesday, etc.  I normally don't do Easter bunny stuff unless kids will be around.",

The hearing officer admonished me for being agnostic and wanting equal custody time with my son. \n\nI don't really see how this means that you can't celebrate Christmas? Sure, it's a Christian celebration in origin, but at least in my culture it's odd to *not* celebrate Christmas even if you're not religious. For example, my parents aren't the least bit religious, but still celebrate Christmas every year. I'm not agnostic, I'm atheist, and I celebrate Christmas every year. For me (and my parents) it's no longer about the christian values, it's about having a nice time with the family, eating good food, having some drinks, and just enjoying ourselves.\n\nBesides, most of the christian celebrations have their roots in paganism, at least here in the north. Christmas, at least in the north, is an adapted celebration of \"midvintersolst\u00e5nd\", midsummer is a *very* pagan celebration (even though the church appropriated it, we still have parts that are very pagan in origin, such as the \"midsommarst\u00e5ng\" that is is a phallic symbol), and so on.",

Philosophically, **knowledge** is justified true belief....or really, really, really, really, really believing something to be true. So knowledge and belief are two points within the same scale with one being further than the other, and not two separate sides of a coin that you are implying.\n\nHowever, pragmatically, if you meant the colloquial use of **belief**, as in rituals, behavioral patterns, social interactions, so on, then belief and knowledge are indeed separate.\n\nBut then you go into a/gnosticism which is okay, but tangentially relevant. A/gnosticism have little to no pragmatic value and use in daily life, and are mostly left to philosophical argumentation. Further, gnosticism is countered by the problem of hard solipsism, so to me this is as useless a distinction as killing ants with a toothpick. Not to mention it is utterly irrelevant to the topic.",

If you don't believe but leave room for the possibility that a god or gods might exist, you're an agnostic atheist. Likewise for theism and the belief that a god or gods do exist. You can be an agnostic Christian (or Muslim, Jew, Buddhist, etc).\n\n>I only requested the custody hearing because my son has told his mom and myself that he wants to spend the break with me, since he spent the last one with her. She lied about this point in the hearing and stated that our son doesn't want to spend any holidays with me.\n\nWas your son not present?",

To the court, that is going to mean that her custody request is granted more weight given that you essentially came right out and said you don't care about that time of year at all. \n\nThis won't be popular advice on this sub, but you need to decide if it's more important to spend more time with your son or to make some kind of point (that the court won't care about) regarding atheism. This is a situation where you can be practical or be ideological. Choose one, you can't have both.",

Look up the Chewbacca defense... When asked about all his illegal activities former alleged attorney General Jeff Sessions showed what integrity his party has by answering \"I don't recall\" to any incriminating questions, whether he did recall or not, you can use the system when others are trying to use it to get you whether you did something or not.

      "text": ">Is it legal to use my non-religious beliefs against me in a holiday custody dispute?\n\nLegal is such a black and white term that lacks context.  Let's use a hypothetical - say the child regularly practices a religion with a parent.  In that case, the other parent's refusal to practice - say a midnight mass - with the child does seem to be potentially detrimental to the child's adjustment to his community (may be a \"factor\" for custody in your jurisdiction).  \n\nLet's flip the hypothetical.  Say the child was 14+, mature, and had a consistent history of adamantly disbelieving a religion while staunchly avoiding any practice of said religion.  In that example, a parents attempt at forcing the child to participate in a religions event (even IF that parent had legal custody) would likely be found detrimental. \n\nNote, certain elements I mentioned above may vary based upon the jurisdiction.  I have also found variance of weight applied to various factors by county/judge.  \n\nThis is not intended to constitute legal advice.  This is a just a late-at-night post and one would be foolish to take said post as legal advice.  Likewise no relationship is formed.  No expertise is stated or implied.",
