He served as the VP of Propulsion Engineering from 2002 to 2014 and Propulsion CTO from 2014 to 2019. He currently serves as an Senior Adviser. He's regarded as one of the foremost spacecraft propulsion experts in the world and owns many patents for propulsion technologies.\n\n>Not true, I am an advisor now. Elon and the Propulsion department are leading development of the SpaceX engines, particularly Raptor.  I offer my 2 cents to help from time to time\"\n\n[Source](https://twitter.com/lrocket/status/1099411086711746560?s=20)\n\n>We\u2019ll have, you know, a group of people sitting in a room, making a key decision. And everybody in that room will say, you know, basically, \u201cWe need to turn left,\u201d and Elon will say \u201cNo, we\u2019re gonna turn right.\u201d You know, to put it in a metaphor. And that\u2019s how he thinks. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou guys are taking the easy way out; we need to take the hard way.\u201d  \n>  \n>And, uh, I\u2019ve seen that hurt us before, I\u2019ve seen that fail, but I\u2019ve also seen\u2014 where nobody thought it would work\u2014 it was the right decision. It was the harder way to do it, but in the end, it was the right thing.\n\n[Source](https://streamable.com/4o1k6d)\n\n>When the third chamber cracked, Musk flew the hardware back to California, took it to the factory floor, and, with the help of some engineers, started to fill the chambers with an epoxy to see if it would seal them. *\u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to get his hands dirty,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cHe\u2019s out there with his nice Italian shoes and clothes and has epoxy all over him. They were there all night and tested it again and it broke anyway.\u201d* Musk, clothes ruined, had decided the hardware was flawed, tested his hypothesis, and moved on quickly.\n\nSource (Ashlee Vance's Biography).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Kevin Watson**\n\nKevin Watson ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkevinwatson/)) developed the avionics for Falcon 9 and Dragon. He previously managed the Advanced Computer Systems and Technologies Group within the Autonomous Systems Division at NASA's Jet Propulsion laboratory.\n\n>Elon is brilliant. *He\u2019s involved in just about everything*. He understands everything. If he asks you a question, you learn very quickly not to go give him a gut reaction.  \n>  \n>He wants answers that get down to the fundamental laws of physics. *One thing he understands really well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like nobody else.* The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy.  \n>  \n>*He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all these equations in real time.* It\u2019s amazing to watch the amount of knowledge he has accumulated over the years.\n\nSource (Ashlee Vance's Biography).

He joined SpaceX as a senior engineer working on astronaut safety and mission assurance. He was later promoted to director of crew operations. He left this position in May 2018 and is now a Senior Advisor. He also functions as Professor of Astronautical Engineering at University of Southern California.\n\n>\u201cI first met Elon for my job interview,\u201d Reisman told the USA TODAY Network's Florida Today. \u201cAll he wanted to talk about were technical things. We talked a lot about different main propulsion system design architectures.  \n>  \n>\u201cAt the end of my interview, I said, \u2018Hey, are you sure you want to hire me? You\u2019ve already got an astronaut, so are you sure you need two around here?\u2019 \u201d Reisman asked. \u201cHe looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not hiring you because you\u2019re an astronaut. I\u2019m hiring you because you\u2019re a good engineer.\u2019 \u201d  \n>  \n>Managing SpaceX and Tesla, building out new businesses and maintaining relationships with his family makes Musk a busy billionaire.  \n>  \n>\u201cHe\u2019s obviously skilled at all those different functions, but certainly what really drives him and where his passion really is, is his role as CTO,\u201d or chief technology officer, Reisman said. \u201cBasically his role as chief designer and chief engineer. That\u2019s the part of the job that really plays to his strengths.\"\n\n([Source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/05/26/spacex-how-elon-musk-took-idea-cusp-history/5257977002/))\n\n>What's really remarkable to me is the breadth of his knowledge. I mean I've met a lot of super super smart people but they're usually super super smart on one thing and he's able to have conversations with our top engineers about the software, and the most arcane aspects of that and then he'll turn to our manufacturing engineers and have discussions about some really esoteric welding process for some crazy alloy and he'll just go back and forth and his ability to do that across the different technologies that go into rockets cars and everything else he does.\n\n([Source](https://youtu.be/GNG6ZzDh9C8?t=390))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Josh Boehm**\n\nJosh Boehm ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshboehm/), [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Josh-Boehm)) is the former Head of Software Quality Assurance at SpaceX.\n\n>Elon is both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer of SpaceX, so of course he does more than just \u2018some very technical work\u2019. He is integrally involved in the actual design and engineering of the rocket, and at least touches every other aspect of the business (but I would say the former takes up much more of his mental real estate).

              "text": "**Christian Davenport**\n\nChristian Davenport is [the Washington Post's defense and space reporter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/christian-davenport/) and the author of \"Space Barons\". The following quotes are excerpts from his book.\n\n>He dispatched one of his lieutenants, Liam Sarsfield, then a high-ranking NASA official in the office of the chief engineer, to California to see whether the company was for real or just another failure in waiting.  \n>  \n>Most of all, he was impressed with Musk, *who was surprisingly fluent in rocket engineering and understood the science of propulsion and engine design*. Musk was intense, preternaturally focused, and extremely determined. \u201cThis was not the kind of guy who was going to accept failure,\u201d Sarsfield remembered thinking.  \n>  \n>Throughout the day, as Musk showed off mockups of the Falcon 1 and Falcon 5, the engine designs, and plans to build a spacecraft capable of flying humans, Musk peppered Sarsfield with questions. He wanted to know what was going on within NASA. And how a company like his would be perceived. *He asked tons of highly technical questions, including a detailed discussion about \u201cbase heating,\u201d the heat radiating out from the exhaust going back up into the rocket\u2019s engine compartment\u2014a particular problem with rockets that have clusters of engines next to one another, as Musk was planning to build*.  \n>  \n>Now that he had a friend inside of NASA, Musk kept up with the questions in the weeks after Sarsfield\u2019s visit, firing off \u201ca nonstop torrent of e-mails\u201d and texts, Sarsfield said. Musk jokingly warned that texting was a \u201ccore competency.\u201d \u201cHe sends texts in a constant flow,\u201d Sarsfield recalled. \u201cI found him to be consumed by whatever was in front of him and anxious to solve problems. This, combined with a tendency to work eighteen hours a day, is a sign of someone driven to succeed.\u201d *Musk was particularly interested in the docking adapter of the International Space Station, the port where the spacecraft his team was designing would dock. He wanted to know the dimensions, the locking pin design, even the bolt pattern of the hatch. The more documents Sarsfield sent, the more questions Musk had*.  \n>  \n>\u201cI really enjoyed the way he would pore over problems anxious to absorb every detail. To my mind, someone that clearly committed deserves all the support and help you can give him.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Mosdell ( 10th employee ) found Musk a touch awkward and abrupt, but smart. Mosdell had showed up prepared to talk about his experience building launchpads, which, after all, was what SpaceX wanted him to do. *But instead, Musk wanted to talk hard-core rocketry.* Specifically the Delta IV rocket and its RS-68 engines, which Mosdell had some experience with when at Boeing. Over the course of the interview, they discussed \u201clabyrinth purges\u201d and \u201cpump shaft seal design\u201d and \u201cthe science behind using helium as opposed to nitrogen.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>After the meeting on Valentine\u2019s Day adjourned, Musk offered to give the group a tour of his facility. To this group of engineers and entrepreneurs, it was like an invitation to a six-year-old to visit a chocolate factory. As Musk guided them through the factory floor, the group \u201clet loose with detailed, technical questions, and he answered all of them,\u201d [Gedmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gedmark) said. *\u201cNot once did he say, \u2018I don\u2019t feel comfortable answering that because it\u2019s proprietary.\u2019\u2026 It was certainly impressive.\u201d*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**John Carmack**\n\nJohn Carmack ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack)) is a programmer, video game developer and engineer. He's the founder of Armadillo Aerospace and current CTO of Oculus VR.\n\n>Elon is definitely an engineer. He is deeply involved with technical decisions at spacex and Tesla. He doesn\u2019t write code or do CAD today, but he is perfectly capable of doing so.\n\n([Source](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1038832124747571200?s=19))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Robert Zubrin**\n\nRobert Zubrin ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin)) is an aerospace engineer and author, best known for his advocacy of human exploration of Mars.\n\n>When I met Elon it was apparent to me that although he had a scientific mind and he understood scientific principles, he did not know anything about rockets. Nothing. That was in 2001. *By 2007 he knew everything about rockets - he really knew everything, in detail. You have to put some serious study in to know as much about rockets as he knows now*. This doesn't come just from hanging out with people.\n\n([Source](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/whats-driving-elon-musk))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Statements by Elon Himself\n\n>Yes. The design of Starship and the Super Heavy rocket booster I changed to a special alloy of stainless steel. I was contemplating this for a while. And this is somewhat counterintuitive. It took me quite a bit of effort to convince the team to go in this direction.\n\n([Source](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a25953663/elon-musk-spacex-bfr-stainless-steel/))\n\n>*I know more about rockets than anyone at the company by a pretty significant margin*, I could redraw substantial portions of the rocket from memory without the blueprints\n\n([Source](https://youtu.be/MAVoOcEytsU?t=206))\n\n>Tim Dodd: \"What people don't understand is that *you're the lead engineer.* You're literally sitting\"  \n>  \n>Musk: \"Literally. This is a... I've actually had a dinner with some, with a, with a friend and he was like 'well who's the chief engineer of SpaceX?' I was like it's me. He was like 'it's not you, who is it?' Look it's either someone with a very low ego or I don't know.\"\n\n([Source](https://youtu.be/cIQ36Kt7UVg))\n\n>Interviewer: What do you do when you're at SpaceX and Tesla? What does your time look like there?  \n>  \n>Elon: Yes, it's a good question. I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things\\*. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design.\\* Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it.  \n>  \n>Interviewer: You probably don't remember this. A very long time ago, many, many, years, you took me on a tour of SpaceX. And the most impressive thing was that you knew every detail of the rocket and every piece of engineering that went into it. And I don't think many people get that about you.  \n>  \n>Elon: Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, *Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer.* She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. *And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team,* working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. *At Tesla, it's working on the Model 3* and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.\n\n([Source](https://www.ycombinator.com/future/elon/))",

This is a market standard, whether you are looking at battery tech, seating, glazing, soft trim... literally any part of the car. It's cost effective to have production and development facilities managed by external specialised suppliers (who in turn are managed by a smaller internal team) than to bring all of that in-house.

They definitely had some issues with quality in 2019 and even early 2020, but as of late quality has improved dramatically as they reduced some inefficient automation and relied on skilled labor who is more precise.  From a manufacturing perspective and technology perspective Tesla is years ahead, although many can catch up by utilizing giga-presses which are sold by a company called Idra.  It's going to be more difficult than legacy auto thinks to catch up.  I know most on here probably believe legacy will, but I am not counting on it besides maybe Ford and VW.",

Used Teslas sell for the same price as new ones because people are so eager to buy them. Tesla is increasing production by 50% year over year for the last 7 years and still can't keep up with demand.",

Many manufacturers increase production quantities naturally through a vehicle lifecycle, regardless of demand.

Very few (mostly small, luxury) brands build to order for the bulk of their manufacturing. Most are pre-specced vehicles intended to go to dealerships to be sold as-seen, which allows for the manufacturer to control the production quantities.",

Because that happened to my friend. As well as rust issue, door fitting and so, so, SO MANY problems that I don't even want to spend more time detailing.    \nNot to mention the shitty iPad in the middle is in no way an improvement over \"classical\" controls. No, once again it's there for cutting cost but it's shit.  \nClimb in an i-Pace and tell me the tesla iPad is better again... \n\nA car mechanic who was working for them here is Oslo put it best: \"I will NEVER understand why people put so much money in such fragile, crappy cars.

I find it amusing how many people complain about what they think it's like. \n\nI can't think of a single \"menu\" I would have any need to look through while I'm driving. There are two things I might do with the touch screen while driving.\n\n1) I might want to choose different music in Spotify. I'd like to hear of a vehicle or system that doesn't require you to look at a screen to change playlists or search for an artist. In fact, I think Tesla does it better because it's super easy to choose other playlists that I use frequently because it's nice and big. A TON easier than if I had to pull out the phone and choose something. OR you just use voice.\n\n2) I may want to adjust the temp up or down a few degrees, but that's right at the corner of the screen and you can easily tap to change. OR you can just use voice.\n\nThere is not a single other thing that I do that requires the touchscreen while driving. Audio controls have a physical joystick on the steering wheel (which I think is far better than controls on any other car I've driven/rented in the last 3 years) Turn signals and cruise control are stalks. Window washer spray and a \"quick swipe\" are stalks.\n\nLocking doors: automatic, Headlights: automatic. Sat Nav: voice control works best, but any flaws here would be the same with any other car. Wipers: automatic.\n\nWhat else do you need to do that requires scrambling through a finicky touchscreen menu?",

People just lose their shit because it's 3 inches to the right of the steering wheel instead of 3 inches within it.\n\nI do wish that Tesla had put hard buttons under the screen. They could have still be software controlled. I have three issues with the interior of the Model 3. \n\nThe biggest offender is the door handles on the inside. They are HORRIBLY designed. A far second place is I wish there were hard buttons for temp up/down. And waaaay down the list is that the glove compartment should have had a physical button (although over time, I realize how rarely I use it because there's ample storage elsewhere).\n\nThe rear visibility is also the worst I've ever seen on a car.\n\nThat said, I've rented a dozen cars in the last two years, and if Tesla's interior get a \"B\", the majority are \"C\". The higher end cars are more like \"B-\" because they're nice but button heavy. I had a fucking Hyundai that had the \"next/prev\" tracks as the up/down (and they were backward) and the volume \"up/down\" were left/right.

I\u2019m thinking specifically of two doctors who were in their late 50\u2019s & mid 60\u2019\u2019s in Texas. One came to visit his college buddy and they took his new toy around the cul de sac for a ride before dinner. The sad part is the car hit a tree and the system failed , the two men could not get out and tragedy struck. There are dozens of these stories. I think it\u2019s a death trap and there aren\u2019t enough charging stations , on top of that I don\u2019t appreciate having to pay for the charging stations on my ConEd bill. I don\u2019t own one , nor am I getting the tax break. Aside from saying Elon is not an engineer- is that because he didn\u2019t attend Stanford? He just recently thanked one of his professors on Twitter. College is not for everyone and he\u2019s been sheepish at times and open at times about his battles. I think any engineering student would trade places with him in a heartbeat. No matter how polarizing he is , the guy is innovative and ingenious.",

This chip will also allow other things.\n- Elon is doing his best to solve the traffic problem in most major cities.\n\nThese are just some of the things he has touched on so far.. tomorrow is Tesla AI day (September 30th) make sure to watch it so you can be more educated in the Tesla world.",

But in electric cars, more energy is conserved in making go, so the final amount of go produced is more stable, but considerably lower than with gas. So the difference that the handles make is significant for the electric cars which have less power and room for loss, but for gas cars, so much energy is already lost all throughout the process that a little more from the handles doesn't really matter. \n\n\nDon't take this as true though I'm sorta guessing.",

Making the aero more efficient doesn't really make a lot of difference when the base efficiency is terrible. \n\nElectric drivelines are like 90% efficient instead of 25% efficient, so the small aerodynamic effects are a much larger chunk of the overall losses. This shows up more clearly because batteries store a lot less energy than gas. \n\nELI5: EV's are basically full-size cars driving around with 3-gallon gas tanks but getting 100mpg. If you waste 0.5gallons with bad aerodynamics you now have 2.5 gallons available instead of 3. In a gas car with a 15 gallon tank you go from 15 to 14.5 gallons and the user basically doesn't notice a difference.",

What makes it worse is that aerodynamic drag is proportional to the square of velocity so that means if you are going 2x faster then there is 4x more drag. In my opinion the door handles honestly have a negligible effect due to the fact they are so small.",

Though a place to channel obsession, is what our be more welcomed. Some neuroticism can drive change. That being said being neurotic is not natural. Doing less is.\n\nSo in the poverty of the human spirit, you should not blame people for being frustrated with the seeming inaccessible bridging of reality with imagination. You need to empower them, and not oppress them with the process.\n\nOur great distorted stories resonant through the masses, until they try to use them to use people.   Determinism, vs chaos, vs nondeterminism, all really great questions in a substrate, model based realism, or agent based model. Not just sides to pick, but what ought be important to the departments of government. But what do we do? We reduce things to colored blocks and move those around to enslave people. Then we are left with a pile of shit, but oh wait here comes the money for the next farce. The truth is, people are disinterested to the point they lie to themselves. They lie to others.\n\nThe actual truth is much deeper, more humble, and yet we must be multimodal to be deep enough to be shallow. No one will every tell you whether the philosophy of science ought use classical or conditional probability. Never. No one will ever convince you superposition is an [ontological phenomenon, with greater fidelity of 50%, in the tiling of Unitarity of the multiverse.](https://phys.org/news/2017-02-strongest-evidence-quantum-state-real.amp) \n\nIntegral processes should not be exclusive of the human, though sometimes, it may have to be modal to particular needs of oneself and others(and this can get a whole lot more complicated in others vs others, or others vs structure for novelty). Sometimes things are the same and not exclusive, sometimes we are thankfully we can deny such unity to allow more than one perspective. And so we will continue to anticipate.\n\nOn more of a side note. I love what they did with the exterior panels of the Tesla. They don\u2019t align perfectly. Made an aesthetic compromise to ship more of them. Most of them are dark colors so you don\u2019t notice the inconsistency. Right there in your face, compromise for the decision of the dollar to vote to procure more.",

Nikola knew AC would travel further with less voltage lost, he also knew it would still need to be converted to DC afterwards for appliances. No one was ever arguing that appliances should be one or the other. But everyone was arguing whether the infrastructure should be AC or DC. \n\nThey were pretty directly compared by the public at the time with regards to infrastructure. It's not weird to compare them now.\n\nEdit: literally hold on, *\"odd to compare them in that way\"* you say, but that's literally what the entire public did. That's like the whole story is that they were compared against each other by the public. What?? Are you forgetting that comparing them directly was literally what we already did as a civilization...",

Most of these appliances also have a DC circuit to power electronics these days, but in terms of actual consumption, AC is doing 99% of the leg work making your refrigerator compressor spin or making the heating element on your stove red-hot.",

The trick is to send it using very high voltage, and then step it down when you reach the place where it is used before you distributed it out (ie a substation). Only AC can step up/down voltages using a transformer because of the way it physically works; it can induce magnetic field back and fro.",

And AC is fine for heating coils of all kinds -- DC could also be used for heating, but why go to the extra complexity and expense of converting it to DC if you don't need to?\n\nAnd, at least until recently with the move to LED bulbs, pretty much all lights worked on AC as well. (Now, though, most LED lights convert the AC to relatively low voltage DC before using it.)",

At any given transmission level, when you double the distance \\[of the receiver\\] from the transmitter the strength of the power at the receiver declines by a factor of four.\n\nThis can be somewhat mitigated, but it requires the use of a formed beam and the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna need to be pointed directly at each other. For best results, both antennas should be polarized the same way (horizontal or vertical), but then there is the additional factor of wave rotation which can be problematic at longer distances.",

Sounds like this one's dead then.\"\n\nThat was revelatory for me: the company was so used to rubber-stamps for all their stupid software patents, regardless of whether they actually had the right to get their patent, that even the slightest resistance was seen as an unusual inconvenience for them.",

I think the problem is more that we don't encourage public transit very much here in North america. Our cities are not very navigable in buses and trains a lot of the time and it makes more people drive. If 20 people who would drive take the bus that's 20 less cars on the road no matter what kind of energy they're using for propulsion.\n\nWhen you couple that with the fact that a lot of places still have dirty power generation then it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me that we're pushing electric cars the way we are. The only explanation I can find really is that car companies want you to buy an electric car because you'll probably have to buy a nearly new one and they are hella expensive which makes them more money",

He didn't invent his rockets or cars but he still had to make the right decisions regarding engineering / business tradeoffs to get his products to market which requires understanding both the business and the engineering sides of what his companies do.\n\nAnd most of us engineers will go our entire careers without filing a patent. Engineering is about applying existing rules of math and physics to build things, sometimes you might come up with a novel way of applying them that's worthy of a patent, but nothing about engineering requires it. Someone who's goal is to come up with a novel idea that they can sell or patent would be called an Inventor, not an Engineer.",

                  "text": "Part 1/2\n\n\n>I helped Elon start the company and all of these answers are spot on. He still has my book on rocket propulsion.....\n\n>What I found from working with Elon is that he starts by defining a goal and he puts a lot of effort into understanding what that goal is and why it is a good and valid goal. His goal, as I see it, has not changed from the day he first called me in August of 2001. I still hear it in his speeches. His goal was to make mankind a multi planetary species and to do that he had to first solve the transportation problem.\n\n>Once he has a goal, his next step is to learn as much about the topic at hand as possible from as many sources as possible. He is by far the single smartest person that I have ever worked with ... period. I can't estimate his IQ but he is very very intelligent. And not the typical egg head kind of smart. He has a real applied mind. He literally sucks the knowledge and experience out of people that he is around. He borrowed all of my college texts on rocket propulsion when we first started working together in 2001. We also hired as many of my colleagues in the rocket and spacecraft business that were willing to consult with him. It was like a gigantic spaceapalooza. At that point we were not talking about building a rocket ourselves, only launching a privately funded mission to Mars. I found out later that he was talking to a bunch of other people about rocket designs and collaborating on some spreadsheet level systems designs for launchers. Once our dealings with the Russians fell apart, he decided to build his own rocket and this was the genesis of SpaceX.\n\n>So I am going to suggest that he is successful not because his visions are grand, not because he is extraordinarily smart and not because he works incredibly hard. All of those things are true. The one major important distinction that sets him apart is his inability to consider failure. It simply is not even in his thought process. He cannot conceive of failure and that is truly remarkable. It doesn't matter if its going up against the banking system (Paypal), going up against the entire aerospace industry (SpaceX) or going up against the US auto industry (Tesla). He can't imagine NOT succeeding and that is a very critical trait that leads him ultimately to success. He and I had very similar upbringings, very similar interests and very similar early histories. He was a bit of a loner and so was I. He decided to start a software company at age 13. I decided to design and build my own stereo amplifier system at age 13. Both of us succeeded at it. We both had engineers for fathers and were extremely driven kids. What separated us, I believe, was his lack of even being able to conceive failure. I know this because this is where we parted ways at SpaceX. We got to a point where I could not see it succeeding and walked away. He didn't and succeeded. I have 25 years experience building space hardware and he had none at the time. So much for experience.\n\n> I recently wrote an op-ed piece for Space News where I also suggest that his ruthlessly efficient way to deploy capital is another great reason for his success. He can almost smell the right way through a problem and he drives his staff and his organization hard to achieve it. The results speak for themselves. The article is here [End of WWII Model Shakes Up Aerospace Industry.](https://spacenews.com/37245end-of-wwii-model-shakes-up-aerospace-industry/)\n\n>In the end I think that we are seeing a very fundamental shift in the way our world takes on the big challenges facing humanity and Elon's Way as I call it will be considered the tip of the spear. My hat's off to the man.\n\n~~ [Jim Cantrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cantrell)\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n>Not true, I am an advisor now. Elon and the Propulsion department are leading development of the SpaceX engines, particularly Raptor. I offer my 2 cents to help from time to time\"\n\n>We\u2019ll have, you know, a group of people sitting in a room, making a key decision. And everybody in that room will say, you know, basically, \u201cWe need to turn left,\u201d and Elon will say \u201cNo, we\u2019re gonna turn right.\u201d You know, to put it in a metaphor. And that\u2019s how he thinks. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou guys are taking the easy way out; we need to take the hard way.\u201d\n\n>And, uh, I\u2019ve seen that hurt us before, I\u2019ve seen that fail, but I\u2019ve also seen\u2014 where nobody thought it would work\u2014 it was the right decision. It was the harder way to do it, but in the end, it was the right thing.\n\n>When the third chamber cracked, Musk flew the hardware back to California, took it to the factory floor, and, with the help of some engineers, started to fill the chambers with an epoxy to see if it would seal them. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid to get his hands dirty,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cHe\u2019s out there with his nice Italian shoes and clothes and has epoxy all over him. They were there all night and tested it again and it broke anyway.\u201d Musk, clothes ruined, had decided the hardware was flawed, tested his hypothesis, and moved on quickly.\n\n\n\n~~ [Tom Mueller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Mueller)\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Elon is brilliant. He\u2019s involved in just about everything. He understands everything. If he asks you a question, you learn very quickly not to go give him a gut reaction.\n\n>He wants answers that get down to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands really well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like nobody else. The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy.\n\n>He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all these equations in real time. It\u2019s amazing to watch the amount of knowledge he has accumulated over the years.\n\n~~ [Kevin Watson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rkevinwatson/) \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>\u201cI first met Elon for my job interview,\u201d Reisman told the USA TODAY Network's Florida Today. \u201cAll he wanted to talk about were technical things. We talked a lot about different main propulsion system design architectures.\n\n>\u201cAt the end of my interview, I said, \u2018Hey, are you sure you want to hire me? You\u2019ve already got an astronaut, so are you sure you need two around here?\u2019 \u201d Reisman asked. \u201cHe looked at me and said, \u2018I\u2019m not hiring you because you\u2019re an astronaut. I\u2019m hiring you because you\u2019re a good engineer.\u2019 \u201d\n\n>Managing SpaceX and Tesla, building out new businesses and maintaining relationships with his family makes Musk a busy billionaire.\n\n>\u201cHe\u2019s obviously skilled at all those different functions, but certainly what really drives him and where his passion really is, is his role as CTO,\u201d or chief technology officer, Reisman said. \u201cBasically his role as chief designer and chief engineer. That\u2019s the part of the job that really plays to his strengths.\"\n\n>What's really remarkable to me is the breadth of his knowledge. I mean I've met a lot of super super smart people but they're usually super super smart on one thing and he's able to have conversations with our top engineers about the software, and the most arcane aspects of that and then he'll turn to our manufacturing engineers and have discussions about some really esoteric welding process for some crazy alloy and he'll just go back and forth and his ability to do that across the different technologies that go into rockets cars and everything else he does.\n\n\n~~[Garrett Reisman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Reisman) \n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n>Elon is both the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer of SpaceX, so of course he does more than just \u2018some very technical work\u2019. He is integrally involved in the actual design and engineering of the rocket, and at least touches every other aspect of the business (but I would say the former takes up much more of his mental real estate).

Musk was intense, preternaturally focused, and extremely determined. \u201cThis was not the kind of guy who was going to accept failure,\u201d Sarsfield remembered thinking.\n\n>Throughout the day, as Musk showed off mockups of the Falcon 1 and Falcon 5, the engine designs, and plans to build a spacecraft capable of flying humans, Musk peppered Sarsfield with questions. He wanted to know what was going on within NASA. And how a company like his would be perceived. He asked tons of highly technical questions, including a detailed discussion about \u201cbase heating,\u201d the heat radiating out from the exhaust going back up into the rocket\u2019s engine compartment\u2014a particular problem with rockets that have clusters of engines next to one another, as Musk was planning to build.\n\n>Now that he had a friend inside of NASA, Musk kept up with the questions in the weeks after Sarsfield\u2019s visit, firing off \u201ca nonstop torrent of e-mails\u201d and texts, Sarsfield said. Musk jokingly warned that texting was a \u201ccore competency.\u201d \u201cHe sends texts in a constant flow,\u201d Sarsfield recalled. \u201cI found him to be consumed by whatever was in front of him and anxious to solve problems. This, combined with a tendency to work eighteen hours a day, is a sign of someone driven to succeed.\u201d Musk was particularly interested in the docking adapter of the International Space Station, the port where the spacecraft his team was designing would dock. He wanted to know the dimensions, the locking pin design, even the bolt pattern of the hatch. The more documents Sarsfield sent, the more questions Musk had.\n\n>\u201cI really enjoyed the way he would pore over problems anxious to absorb every detail. To my mind, someone that clearly committed deserves all the support and help you can give him.\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\n>Mosdell ( 10th employee ) found Musk a touch awkward and abrupt, but smart. Mosdell had showed up prepared to talk about his experience building launchpads, which, after all, was what SpaceX wanted him to do. But instead, Musk wanted to talk hard-core rocketry. Specifically the Delta IV rocket and its RS-68 engines, which Mosdell had some experience with when at Boeing. Over the course of the interview, they discussed \u201clabyrinth purges\u201d and \u201cpump shaft seal design\u201d and \u201cthe science behind using helium as opposed to nitrogen.\u201d\n\n\u200b\n\n>After the meeting on Valentine\u2019s Day adjourned, Musk offered to give the group a tour of his facility. To this group of engineers and entrepreneurs, it was like an invitation to a six-year-old to visit a chocolate factory. As Musk guided them through the factory floor, the group \u201clet loose with detailed, technical questions, and he answered all of them,\u201d Gedmark said. \u201cNot once did he say, \u2018I don\u2019t feel comfortable answering that because it\u2019s proprietary.\u2019\u2026 It was certainly impressive.\u201d\n\n\u200b~~ [Christian Davenport](https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/christian-davenport/)\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n>Elon is definitely an engineer. He is deeply involved with technical decisions at spacex and Tesla. He doesn\u2019t write code or do CAD today, but he is perfectly capable of doing so.\n\n\n[John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack)\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n>When I met Elon it was apparent to me that although he had a scientific mind and he understood scientific principles, he did not know anything about rockets. Nothing. That was in 2001. By 2007 he knew everything about rockets - he really knew everything, in detail. You have to put some serious study in to know as much about rockets as he knows now. This doesn't come just from hanging out with people.\n\n~~ [Robert Zubrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Zubrin)\n\n\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\npart 2/2",

                              "text": "You really need to hear people who worked with Musk before being confidently incorrect based off vague assumptions you have about him. For example, Tom Mueller:\n\n> One thing I tell people often is that\u2014 I\u2019ve seen this happen quite a few times in the fifteen years I\u2019ve worked for him. We\u2019ll have, you know, a group of people sitting in a room, making a key decision. And everybody in that room will say, you know, basically, \u201cWe need to turn left,\u201d and Elon will say \u201cNo, we\u2019re gonna turn right.\u201d You know, to put it in a metaphor. And that\u2019s how he thinks. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou guys are taking the easy way out; we need to take the hard way.\u201d\n\n> And, uh, I\u2019ve seen that hurt us before, I\u2019ve seen that fail, but I\u2019ve also seen\u2014 where nobody thought it would work\u2014 it was the right decision. It was the harder way to do it, but in the end, it was the right thing. One of the things that we did with the Merlin 1D was; he kept complaining\u2014 I talked earlier about how expensive the engine was. [inaudible] [I said,] \u201c[the] only way is to get rid of all these valves. Because that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the complexity and cost.\u201d And how can you do that? And I said, \u201cWell, on smaller engines, we\u2019d go face-shutoff, but nobody\u2019s done it on a really large engine. It\u2019ll be really difficult.\u201d And he said, \u201cWe need to do face-shutoff. Explain how that works?\u201d So I drew it up, did some, you know, sketches, and said \u201chere\u2019s what we\u2019d do,\u201d and he said \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d And I advised him against it; I said it\u2019s going to be too hard to do, and it\u2019s not going to save that much. But he made the decision that we were going to do face-shutoff.\n\n> So we went and developed that engine; and it was hard. We blew up a lot of hardware. And we tried probably tried a hundred different combinations to make it work; but we made it work. I still have the original sketch I did; I think it was\u2014 what was it, Christmas 2011, when I did that sketch? And it\u2019s changed quite a bit from that original sketch, but it was pretty scary for me, knowing how that hardware worked, but by going face-shutoff, we got rid of the main valves, we got rid of the sequencing computer; basically, you spin the pumps and pressure comes up, the pressure opens the main injector, lets the oxygen go first, and then the fuel comes in. So all you gotta time is the ignitor fluid. So if you have the ignitor fluid going, it\u2019ll light, and it\u2019s not going to hard start. That got rid of the problem we had where you have two valves; the oxygen valve and the fuel valve. The oxygen valve is very cold and very stiff; it doesn\u2019t want to move. And it\u2019s the one you want open first. If you relieve the fuel, it\u2019s what\u2019s called a hard start. In fact, we have an old saying that says, \u201c[inaudible][When you start a rocket engine, a thousand things could happen, and only one of those is good]\u201c, and by having sequencing correctly, you can get rid of about 900 of those bad things, we made these engine very reliable, got rid of a lot of mass, and got rid of a lot of costs. And it was the right thing to do.\n\n> And now we have the lowest-cost, most reliable engines in the world. And it was basically because of that decision, to go to do that. \n\nI'm trying to find an engineer from NASA that worked with Musk engineering the Dragon spacecraft (IIRC Musk was in the small (8 people or so?) team doing the preliminary design before he had to split his time with Tesla). But I'm not finding it. It was on youtube...\n\nThere are many other examples, some in this topic: https://old.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/k1e0ta/evidence_that_musk_is_the_chief_engineer_of_spacex/\n\nOf course, he delegates a lot of work, but he is deeply involved at the system level engineering happening at Spacex and understands his rockets. He IS the SpaceX CTO not just in title.",

Yeah Elon Musk seems like a shitty guy, who came from an extremely privileged background, and he obviously didn't single handedly build or design the rocket himself, but, that also doesn't mean he has zero engineering talent or zero responsibility for why he's helped found several companies that have succeeded wildly in areas that others have repeatedly failed. He's an asshole, but he's still an asshole with an engineering background, which makes him heads and tails better than the assholes running Boeing and most of corporate America who just have business backgrounds. There's a reason Boeing is failing at a task that we've been doing for a century and SpaceX is succeeding at one that we've never done before.",

In one paragraph you went from \"They were trying\" to \"well, they tried once failed, and never tried again\".\n\nAlso, SpaceX was profitable without Starlink, just by offering cheaper and faster rocket launches than the competition and gobbling up almost the entire launch market. Starlink is just being used to fund a Mars mission that will almost certainly be unprofitable. \n\n>You think Elon is more important, technically speaking, to reusability than.....\n\nNo, I literally never said he was more important than anyone or anything. I'm just pointing out that everyone in this sub acting like he's not an engineer and deserves zero credit for the technical success of virtually all of his companies seem like they're engaging in a blind hater circle jerk.",

Since you don't drive your own car -- they supply a driver (edit: is this still true?  I can't find current info) -- the driver will not sit there and stare at the fire. Emergency crew arrives via the cleared tunnel.\n\nThe passengers open the door and get out, then either proceed down the tunnel or seek shelter in another vehicle. Yes, there is room to pass the cars on foot (according to Tesla; I've never been there).\n\nSmoke is evacuated using the air supply system, which is built for that purpose.\n\nBut the tunnel is low speed, so an accident is unlikely to result in a fire. And despite the fact that the handful of incidents are well publicized, Teslas bursting into flames spontaneously are extremely rare (there are roughly 8 Tesla fires per year).  The odds of it happening during the time the car is in the tunnel are infinitesimal.\n\nI strongly suspect the time between fires in that tunnel will be greater than 50 years, barring intentional sabotage.  So we'll probably never know how well it handles it.",

Insulting someone is never going to help make a point and (based on my very limited knowledge of psychology) actually reaffirms their existing position because they're goal isnt to find the right answer, it's to prove that the asshole who just insulted them is wrong. You (almost) never win an argument when the other person is emotional. \n\nSecond, you're totally right about SpaceX. I like them because of the innovation but also see some of the dangers. It's like living paycheck by paycheck, except earth is paycheck 1 and Mars is paycheck 2. No regard for the current environment as long as we can reach the next one. \n\nAnd again, I agree with you on Tesla, I think that I like them because they are \"the\" electric car. Kinda like frontrunning but they also made huge steps for the electric car industry in the past which I don't think should be discredited by their current state. \n\nAs for switching to electric, it's complicated. I disagree with the nowhere argument but I think you exaggerated that. It will certainly go somewhere, energy can be made much more efficiently when it's distributed to electric cars rather than gas. The switch is complicated though, because a big part of the environmental impact of a car is in production (I believe its around 50 percent but not sure). Which means that if your car could last twice as long as you've had it you are hurting more than helping. This 50 percent applies to electric cars too. That in addition to batteries being extremely toxic. Also fusion efforts are stalling with a lack of tritium supplies. That means energy is still limited to solar, water, wind, fission, and the dreaded fossil fuels (and obviously some others I missed). \n\nAn important note to add is that combustion engine cars aren't being banned yet just the sale of them. There's also an exception for sustainable fuel that I don't know much about. So we're not completely getting rid of combustion, just pushing very hard to decrease it\n\nAnother thing, how would you progress environmentally without bans like California and Europe have coming up? You could set a quota but that requires someone to step up and make the switch while everyone says \"but I want to keep my engine\". To me I see it as an all or nothing deal - anything in-between just won't work. Maybe combustion could be reintroduced later after the major switch is made but intially I don't see it working any other way.",

His father said: \u201cWe were very wealthy. We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe,\u201d adding that one person would have to hold the money in place with another closing the door.I expect downvotes from his astroturf social medial PR team to be swift and brutal.\n\nLol his father also said that he was flying to england, rerouted somewhere (he thinks is Djibouti, but can't remember), sold the plane for $40k and a stake in an emerald mine in Zambia to Italians. Then later said it was a Panamanian guy who died in 2019, he had very little involvement in the mine, and went bankrupt in the 2000s. There was also no paperwork for the transaction. \n\nNow that sure sounds like a guy I would trust to tell the truth.",

When Musk is suddenly worth billions more, he doesn't actually have that money. It doesn't exist except on paper. It's just because his stock is trading at higher prices.\n\nSure we could put a tax rate on the stock's average value over the year. But if he, Bezos or any of the other billionaire parasites ever tried to sell a portion of their stock to cover it, the value would immediately drop (plus you need to find someone to buy it when you have that many shares). If it caused him to lose a controlling interest the stock would tumble, because it's only worth so much because finance bros simp for billionaires.\n\nThis would reduce his wealth on paper but not enough to make him hurt any. It would have a much larger impact on regular people who have a couple shares or a 401k that is invested in it.\n\nIt's definitely a problem, just one that I don't think has a great solution right now.",

Sorry, bad apology.\n\nWell, this was something i hadn\u2019t thought of before today, but tax on unrealized gains.  Houses are a perfect example that should exist exactly as how property tax works.  The asset is assessed, and then a proportional tax charged.\n\nStocks and so on can be taxed a little differently.  To prevent causing volatility, take the average of how the stock performed over the year compared to last year, so say 4% increase on last years average. Tax that as income earned. \n\nNegative taxes like being able to get tax credits for asset depreciation for businesses is oddly not done in the reverse (when assets increase in value). And what im proposing seems to be like that.\n\nTo reduce inequality, labour (active income) should be taxed at a far lower rate than passive income (stocks, house). \n\nIt just doesnt make sense that money you gain by doing nothing is taxed lower than money you earn by using your time to help somebody.\n\nOf course all these asset taxes can be applied to those above a certain active income amount, and be progressive/increasing like the income tax brackets. (So those who are low active earners arent taxed much for also having passive income)\n\n\nAnd a wealth tax. Calculated the same way, 1% of the asset value per year, on those whos net worth is above a certain worth, increasing to 10% at the billion range.  (These numbers arent based anything, just to give a frame of reference)",

There's no evidence he had any substantial amount of wealth before then. Given that his father currently lives off an allowance Elon gives him, its fair to say there isn't a whole lot of \"apartheid\" money left.",

He literally admitted to it. \n\n2) the only \"proof\" I could find that it isn't true is Elon tweeting that there's no proof it IS true. Y'know, aside from his father's word. \n\n3) Elon came from wealth. His family had money. Elon likes to claim that he didn't use any of that money to start his business, and that he took very little with him when he moved to Canada. Okay, sure. Maybe that's true. Maybe (of course we'd have to rely on his word, and if we're taking everything Elon says as gospel, why are we dismissing his father's word as inherently false?). But people born with golden safety nets can afford to make huge risks. Pretending that his family's money had no effect on him getting where he is today is absurd. He had access to great education growing up, and he never had to worry about ending up destitute for the rest of his life because he has always had the option to crawl home to daddy. That makes a MASSIVE difference. \n\n4) Elon is the richest man. He does not need dick-suckers sticking up for his poor little grotesquely wealthy self. \n\n5) Elon's a pathetic, dumb, creepy man-child. There is TONS of proof of this claim, so I assume no one is going to call me a paid (lol by who the fuck for what reason) shill for that claim, right guys?\n \nAlso, Jesus, I've said some controversial shit on this site and have never gotten as much hate as I had from Elon-lovers. I think I'd get less hate shitting on BTS. Y'all need to touch grass holy shit.\n\nEdit: formatting",

Things like saying 'Russian pals', when in reality, everybody was going to Russia for engines and whatnot at the time, including NASA and ESA.  You're making it sound nefarious, like he had some crooked friends in Russia or something, and he was just gonna 'flip' rockets and pass them off as his own.\n\nIn reality, Musk had some minor space goals initially, went to Russia to see if they could get rockets, they were refused, and then Musk made the decision to try and see if he could build an affordable rocket himself.  That's it.  \n\nAnd then SpaceX was born.\n\nY'all also keep using this bizarre ass line of reasoning that 'because Elon doesn't literally do all the inventing and engineering completely on his own, it means he doesn't do anything and is just stealing other's work', as if leadership just counts for nothing.  Of course he hires engineers and listens to proposals and whatnot.  But he's the one leading the companies and making the decisions, including many critical technical decisions.  He does genuinely have a decent understanding of this stuff, and it's because of his direction that companies like Tesla and SpaceX have become as successful as they are.  It's not just a couple of flukes, where absolutely anybody with a large wallet would have accomplished the same thing.  Bezos has been at this for nearly as long with Blue Origin, with a much bigger wallet, and has accomplished SO much less.\n\nI fully understand disliking Elon as a person, I'm with everybody on that.  And I also agree that Elon isn't a super genius who just magics up all this stuff on his own(obviously).  But the insane extent to which people like you and 99% of people here are rewriting history to make it sound like Elon is just some clueless idiot who bears no responsibility for any of his accomplishments is just asinine.  Fucking clownishly asinine, to be perfectly frank. This narrative just bears no resemblance to actual reality and it's incredibly depressing to see how easily people are misled into misinformation purely because it's what they want to believe.  It's petty and small minded.\n\nAnd also incredibly ironic for this sub.",

The world is *just* now beginning to switch off of them. They make *really* good rocket engines, so much that the US was like \"shit, we need to stop using them because a non-trivial amount of our national security in space is dependent on Russia\". Regarding the US, it was actually part of their plan to make sure that post-collapse Soviet rocket engineers didn't like, go make rockets for other sketchy nations. Kind of like how the US imported all the Nazi rocket scientists that helped fly us to the Moon.\n\nAnyway, Musk's chat with Russia didn't work out, he got denied, so he went out to the desert and started befriending amateur rocket nerds and put his funds into planning and building something better. Nobody in that hobby line is gonna give you the time of day if you cant talk the talk or walk the walk.\n\n> That was the whole plan he came up with.\n\nI swear the people who think this have never worked in any engineering field. You literally can't just put a bunch of individually weird engineers in a room and things pop out, it takes a whole bunch of effort and steering and clear planning and money and learning and a clear end goal to actually produce anything in the rocketry industry. If I gave you 500 million dollars right now, I would wager that you or almost anyone in this entire thread couldn't produce anything close to where SpaceX was even 10-15 years ago.\n\nEngineers worth their salt often don't care about money as much as people think they do, as long as they make what they need. For example every single week I literally turn down jobs 2-5x my current salary- serious cash, signing bonuses, etc. because I'd rather work somewhere that's interesting and I actually believe the product will be successful vs. selling my soul on wallstreet to scrape 0's off the rest of the population.",

Every post on reddit has the majority who despise him and make the same meaningless arguments.\n\n1. He didn't found Tesla. \n  - So what? He invested in the company before any products were build with only the idea to build an electric sports car. He was CEO before any cars were built.\n\n2. He didn't build anything.\n  - No shit that's what he hired engineers for. Tesla wouldn't be what it is today if Elon was in a garage building and designing all the cars himself and who are these billionaire building and designing the products they sell.\n\n3. He never delivers and his ideas fail. Such as the hyperloop, fully self driving cars and going to Mars in 10 years.\n  - Turns out not every idea works or is reached in the predicted time frame. Should people never have ambitious goals and try to meet them? With regards \nto Mars he said 10 years at best 15 - 20 worst case but most redditors leave the rest of that quote out from the 60 Minutes interview.\n\n Let's not forget what His company's have accomplished with his leadership.\n\nWorlds largest manufacturer of electric vehicles in a couple of decades. Reducing global emissions more than any ice car. And is pushing other auto manufacturers to transition to electric to keep up reducing global emissions indirectly.\n\nReusable rockets that have drastically lowered the cost of space travel and building space infrastructure with plans to colonize other planets.\n\nLow orbit satellites that give high speed internet to the entire world and have prevented internet blackouts to Ukraine from Russian invasions. Allowing cellphone calls from almost every location on the Earth who knows how many lives that will save.\n\nHis other companies are still in their infancy and we still don't know whether or not if they will succeed. Everybody was betting on Tesla to fail in 2008-2013.\n\nI don't idolize Musk but I do idolize his ideas that are changing the world for the better.",

It's always such a predictable engagement with you lot.\n\nTruth is Elon turned $23,000 into *$260 billion* and that's why you hate him so much. Because with the same $23k you'd piss it away and have nothing but a busted ass used car in a couple of years. That's why you continue to use the bullshit \"they own emerald mines\" nonsense when the truth of that is Elon's dad invested $80k into a mine and sold that stake a few years later for approximately $60k in profit, all while Elon was a toddler. That's the extent of the Musk emerald empire, but just like the people who think Elon is some god amongst mortals, facts don't really matter to you at all--just your feelings.",

Billionaires are basically just powerful allocators of capital in a broader network of capital markets.\n\nThey can\u2019t reasonable capture their net worth in *actual money*. It\u2019s all tied up in various assets (often mostly in companies they founded), and they have the power to move some of the capital out of one asset and into another. And if the value of that asset increases, then they subsequently control a greater share of the capital and continue the cycle of re-allocation.\n\nSometimes billionaires will extract huge amounts of capital for their personal satisfaction, like buying a mega-yacht or a private jet, but most of that capital stays tied up in publicly traded assets, which in turn props up the net worth of others who allocated capital to those same assets.\n\nBeing a billionaire means never having to worry (on a personal level) about money ever again, but in that sense, it\u2019s not much different from having $20M net worth. In both cases you\u2019re pretty much set for life unless you\u2019re a complete moron.\n\nAll that to say, it\u2019s kinda weird to even think about \u201cdeserving\u201d billions of dollars in net worth. Nobody \u201cdeserves\u201d that kind of thing. It\u2019s not real money to be \u201cearned\u201d. It\u2019s more appropriate think of it in terms of \u201cdeserving that level of power and influence over markets and politics.\u201d Being a billionaire is more like being an extremely powerful unelected politician than anything else you could compare it to.",

It\u2019s literally not his/her money. It\u2019s other people\u2019s money sitting in the market, and if those people decide to convert their shares into cash by selling them, then the billionaire is simply no longer a billionaire anymore. It\u2019s not their own money by any stretch of the imagination. They just have some power to extract a bit of money from the pool of capital other people have invested in that asset.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not even close to being real money. Nor could a billionaire reasonably pull out even half of their net worth in actual cash.\n\nFrom an economic system point of view, a billionaire removing value from their stock in the form of cash would simply drive the price lower, and more investors would be incentivized to divert more of their cash out of the real economy and into the now-very-cheap stock. So the cash pulled out by the billionaire is merely offset by the inflow of cash from multiple other (presumably wealthy) investors. So the net result is the \u201creal economy\u201d never really gains any of that cash, even if the billionaire gives it all away. It merely cycles back into the \u201ccheap\u201d assets.\n\nI get that Musk is a total dick and doesn\u2019t deserve the wealth, fame, influence and (rapidly dwindling) popularity he currently has. Nothing I\u2019ve said contradicts that fact. It\u2019s just that the rhetoric around \u201cwhat that money could be used for\u201d is, both in practice and in theory, a lot like talking about \u201cwhat the money tied up in the S&P 500 could be used for\u201d... It\u2019s not even in the same category as a millionaire\u2019s personal savings. Does that make sense?\n\nP.S.\n\nThere are definitely ways we could change our economic system to be more equitable. But it\u2019s not as simple as laying the blame at the feet of the billionaires and telling them to pay more taxes. It\u2019s really about spreading capital ownership to more and more people. That could be through pension funds or cooperative ownership of businesses or whatever. But giving the common people *literally* more equity should be the goal.",

Because there isn\u2019t a huge difference in practice. If all that \u201cmoney\u201d is tied up in the stock market, it\u2019s silly to think that we could enact some kind of policy to force that capital to flow out of the market and into other things.\n\nLikewise with the assets controlled by billionaires.

I'm sorry I bumped your golden idol, seems like it really hit a nerve for you. Maybe you should find a life that doesn't revolve around \"grindset\" and dirtbag-CEO worship; I think that'd be healthier if you could find meaning and worth in life that doesn't have a currency exchange rate.\n\nI'm looking at Musk's track record. I'm looking at who he's always been: the guy that's so onerous and terrible to work with that every company that was _able_ to do so pushed him out (check out how 1999 and 2000 went for him -- _twice in 2 years_ there were attempts to push him out).\n\nI'm looking at the fact that the only thing he can single-handedly claim credit for is yet another 90s dot-com-bubble startup, and not even one with an original idea.\n\nAnd then I look at people who pretend that he's a genius somehow just because he's gotten really good at using lawyers and apartheid money to attack anyone who says he's not (which, surprise surprise, is mostly the people who did the _actual_ work).",

All you've done is repeat that you don't accept reality, because reality makes your hero look like the villain he is. Repeating \"debunked\" doesn't make evidence go away just because you say it enough times; only evidence can do that, and you've got none.\n\nI hope one day you join me and many others in the land of evidence and fact -- but even more so, I hope one day you're able to find a purpose to your life that isn't dedicated to promoting the falsified image of a distant rich dirtbag who has no idea that you exist and no concern for you.",

Tesla wrote about an incident where a manager at one of Edison's companies promised him a massive bonus if he completed a project, which he did, and never got the bonus for. But Edison personally was not involved in this at all. It's also possible that the bonus a joke, since the amount promised was pretty ludicrous, but we only have Tesla's side",

According to Tesla's autobiography, he was promised a bonus for improving Edison's electric lights while working at the Edison Machine Works. That said, Tesla isn't the most reliable narrator, so we can't say for sure one way or the other.\n\n> he and Tesla... collaborated on xray research\n\nInterested in a source for this if you have it. I didn't think Tesla got into x-rays until his Niagara Falls lab, post-war-of-currents and long after his employment under Edison. As for the rivalry, my understanding is at the time the public would see Westinghouse as Edison's rival if anything.",

The Free Energy AC Generator was another of Tesla's inventions that used the power of magnets to create a self-sustaining cycle of energy production.

No locale, no employees, no patents, no product. Names of the original founders was all the Tesla name had. Elon at the time obviously just wanted to focus on the engineering, as lead engineer of the company. He explained in great detail that he made the mistake of wanting his cake and eating it too. In the sense that instead of creating a brand new company with him as CEO and lead engineer (like spaceX), he jumped into a shell company to turn it into a real company with the intention on focusing only on what he liked doing (engineering) and not on the boring financial, logistical and PR stuff that being a CEO entails. That he could delegate to someone else... Until developing situation internally with the prior founders lead the board to decide that Musk should be CEO instead.\n\nNeedless to say he profusely regrets that decision to not just make the company, just as much as he jokes constantly about how the roadster was conceived exactly backward of how it should have been made. Quite ironic he eventually tried it again with Twitter and that failed just as spectacularly.",

I believe they worked closely with Lotus as well. Musk made the company what it is by making a great call by finding two guys who had a good vision and design for an electric vehicle.

One which you can see does bear striking similarly to the roadster and the original power train literally was licensed tech from ACP. Musk wanted to make that car happen but was advised that \"hey, there is these guys who have this company called Tesla that want to make the same thing, maybe go see them?\"\n\nThe two founders had the idea of making a similar vehicle however Musk was the one who brought the conception and design to make it happen, and took role of general design from the start since it's what he was really interested about.\n\nThe car itself was honestly not that well thought out. Elon in interviews pointed many things, including the very idea of using an Elise as a base, to be *shockingly dumb* in retrospective. Again this is Elon at his Elon-est... That means really wanting to do something, doing something VERY STUPID first, and not giving up and ending making something fantastic in the end.",

It's beyond a shadow of a doubt, with history to prove it, that Tesla would not have reached so high and do it so fast without him. Hate me for it, I don't care. He isn't the mesiah nor is he good at everything (and can be a massive prick and has an ego as high as the ISS), but he is DAMN good at what he does here. \n\nOn the other he as well as the rest of the team got A LOT of things wrong with the roadster and the M3. Both for different reasons. Both of which he understands and repeatedly confirms in interviews and conversations.\n\nThe roadster was essentially a sublist of \"things to not do when making a production EV\". The high level design was sound but everything else was implemented in the about least efficient way possible. The roadster was not a profitable vehicle, which is why it quickly got canned and it's lessons incorporated into the model S, which was a MUCH BETTER designed vehicle. \n\nThen you have the model 3, the first time Tesla really tried to ramp up a serial production to a large level. Once again the high level design was sound and this time the actual manufacturing was decent... But in typical Tesla fashion they took the ramp up or production exactly the wrong way, learning and struggling as they nearly ran the company into the ground. But once again this was NOT for nothing. The days of sleeping on the factory floor, of delaying vacations, and musk literally going all in on his money while being literally a week away from bankruptcy, as well as getting roasted by Sandy Munro, did achieve their purpose. \n\nAfter that Tesla started obliterating their competition in numbers and features, and was actually making industry leading margins on their vehicles. Munro after having being a vocal critic of the first model 3s became absolutely shocked when he discovered every single one of the issues he pointed had been fixed, and ever since has been blown away by the length Tesla went, spured by Elon's relentless drive, to optimize and improve absolutely everything. Want another engineer to confirm Elon knows his shit? Go watch Munro live, I guarantee it will NOT be a waste of time. As an embedded systems engineers by training, it sure as hell wasn't a waste to watch the model 3, Y, S plaid, and Y structural teardown and see the vehicle evolve in real time.",

The idea of an electric sports car was ludicrous, let alone a production model that would go against equivalent ICE vehicles.\n\nElon was the one stubborn enough yet knowledgeable enough to make the call \"it was possible, and I'm going to prove it\". \n\nThe transition would have happened out of nessesity, but Tesla easily sped it up by at least 50 years. It's not flattery, OEMs were locked in with ICE, they were doing EVs as a compliance and were looking to gradually phase out over the course of decades, and only if generous public donations were to account for all the development. Tesla was the first to really ago all in, and it's main effect is that it FORCED all the OEMs to put their plans into motion earlier than excepted, which so far they are all having issues executing to a speed comparable simply because they have all the ICE buisness to lug behind them.",

Looking at the likes of Bezos (who has to act up like he is human in the most infuriating way possible) or Zuckerberg (who I don't think even bothers anymore). But Elon has always been the casual kind, something that indeed crashes hard with the idea that a billionaire should live in his own wealth bubble of super yatchs, private islands and ivory towers. Because that is what even mildly successful businessmen or politicians do, so why not him?\n\nWell honestly it's because he never phased out of being a massive fucking nerd. He is analytical down to it being a problem, approaching everything and everyone based almost entirely towards whenever they are useful to \"the mission\". If they are? Great. If not? Literally thrown on the side, and punch it in the face if it tries to interfere.\n\nThis is why the second richest person on earth is right now living in butfuck nowhere in Boca chica Texas. A 5 star luxury hotel yields absolutely nothing when your only considerations are A sleeping and B being at starbase tomorrow. He probably lives in a trailer home because that means he would be closer to work. He slept in the factory meeting room during the M3 ramp up so it's not like that a new habit either. It's been consistent with his outlook on life, this kind of \"I care about humanity, I don't care about humans\" which is both an asset and a curse. For example I would argue you can't look at kids and birth rates like just a statistic, because you have a sentient being on the line. \n\nWant to understand his wacky hijinks? Ask yourself these 3 questions\n- does it benefit the mission? The mission being growing and spreading the light of consciousness. \n- what would increase the overall public good over the next hundred years? \n- what is the most direct way of doing it?\n\nYou will see that almost everything he does follows these lines to a varying degrees. From the trajectory of SpaceX to calling a lying politician, well, a lying politician. It's why you can't really understand the guy under the lens of your common rich guy, because he just does not fucking care about it. It is up to personal preference to determine if that's better or worse than your garden variety corrupt rich fuck.",

Depending on the school, the CS department will have either grown out of the EE or Math departments historically. EE is engineering (e.g. telecom), math generally isn't (edit: and I'll note, the line here is actually hazier than most people realize - if you go to the 50's and 60's, EE degrees are mostly theoretical rather than applied - i personally just draw the line at \"are you building rube goldberg machines that solve real-world problems\").\n\nThe nuance here is that Computer Science is an overloaded term. Anywhere from:\n\n1. Theoretical computer science (math). Turing machines. This is actually rarer nowadays to my knowledge, since 99% of the students go into the engineering industry.\n\n2. Algorithms/data structures & computer engineering. Here, algos & DS more like engineering primitives (simple machines); data structures are basically tools to software engineers. The focus then narrows to how these primitives are applied to different domains + how hardware/software interact. This is like applied math is to mathematics (CS) in that it is far less theoretical.\n\n3. Electrical engineering. \n\n4. Programming. Which boils down to how to speak to a computer to tell it to do things. E.g. the vast majority of frontend / product engineers don't have to deal with algorithms. Applied mathematicians & physicists do programming too, without necessarily being engineers. If you've used computed columns in excel, you've programmed a computer. If you've inputted commands into a microwave, you've programmed it. \n\nSoftware engineering isn't generally taught in schools to my knowledge. At least, not well :P\n\n>  many software engineers don\u2019t have any degree\n\nTrue, but in the same vein many people who work in aerospace do not have PE certifications. ~80% anecdotally iirc. And a boatload of them have, say, physics degrees :P \n\nI think it's fair to say at its limits, some self-proclaimed software engineers just do web design while others build firmware for autonomous vehicles. There's a pretty large gap between the two. \n\nI'd consider the person who builds online search at Google/FB/Microsoft/Amazon serving billions of people, across clusters of millions of self-synchronizing machines, resilient to network splits, power outages, drive failure, etc, to be engineers, and certainly not, say, applied mathematicians or just 'programmers'. Likewise, I'd consider people who build high-performance robust photorealistic simulations at Nvidia to be engineers.",

The company has a grand total of 2 employees (the CEO and CFO) joined a few months later by a third employee. \n\n- February 2004, still on 3 employees, Tesla starts it's first round of funding, Elon musk first appearing officially within the company at that time, becoming the largest shareholder and head of the board of directors. JB then joined in may 2004. Telsa now accounted for 5 employee, musk INCLUDED that would then all become cofounders. \n\n- 2005 marks the start of Tesla's first development for their eventual first product, the Roadster. Musk takes over the design and high level engineering of the Roadster directly but does not get involved in much of the day to day activities of the company (once again, wanted his cake and eat it too). This is also the first time that Tesla properly hires employees, putting and end to the days where Tesla was just a shell company. \n\n- 2006, Tesla reveals the roaster for the first time\n\n- 2007, the board concludes that Eberhard should step down as CEO. Michel Marks takes over as interim CEO, then Drori. \n\n- in October of 2008, Musk becomes CEO. This same year, the roadster enters production. \n\nSo, that's the TLDR of the beginings of Tesla. Now tell me which part is a lie?",

Who cares if he bought it and forced the owners out? Happens all the time in business. Why lie?",

The company was literally nothing but an idea when Elon invested. Also JB and Elon were both independently looking to to create an EV sports car at the time. That's why Elon was talking with AC Propulsion in the first. After Elon didn't pursue working with AC Propulsion for whatever reason, JB and Elon decided to team up with Marc and Martin. And again, when they teamed up, Tesla was just a sheet of paper. All of this is the reason why the Judge in your link declared all of them as co-founders.",

He said they'd made the original one as a stunt to \"shut up the hippies.\" If Stane had succeeded in killing Tony and Pepper, he would have shifted Stark Industries right back to making weapons and working to reproduce the miniaturized arc reactor for the sake of powering ever more sought after tools of destruction.\n\nTony was an altruist but was hindered by his own narcissism, thinking only he was equipped to use his technology to save the world. We saw him slowly grow out of this but he still never quite saw past the superherosim as the best path to salvation.

But it's well documented that he is deeply involved in technical decisions. Have you seen the interviews where he walks around the Starship base with Everyday Astronaut? You don't fake that level of technical knowledge, and the CEO of my company certainly couldn't answer technical questions about small details of the stuff we make.\n\nSeriously, why do people think he's either a technical god or an idiot? He's just a technically competent CEO. He's not particularly good at business. That's exactly what he has delegated. At SpaceX it's well known that Gwynne Shotwell is the business person. \n\nI wouldn't say he's good at marketing in the traditional sense either. He'd be awful leading a pure marketing company like Coca Cola. He's good at getting people to make products that sell themselves and generating hype. You don't need to see a Tesla ad to know about Tesla, because everyone knows about it just from it being the first high end EV.\n\nWhat he might be best at, is hiring really smart people. And being a technically competent person is a key factor in that skill. The smartest engineers in the world don't want to work for an idiot who doesn't sign off on good technical decisions because \"it doesn't make good business sense\". \n\nThis thread is has just as much cringe as any Elon fan club, just with every opinion flipped to the opposite.\n\nI mean, your comment is one of the more reasonable ones. I just happen to not agree personally",

I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things*. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design.* Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it.\n\nInterviewer: You probably don't remember this. A very long time ago, many, many, years, you took me on a tour of SpaceX. And the most impressive thing was that you knew every detail of the rocket and every piece of engineering that went into it. And I don't think many people get that about you.\n\nElon: Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model 3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.\n\nsource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnBQmEqBCY0",

At larger companies, this is normally more of a problem than a benefit as execs have absolutely no idea how engineering works, and by the time a company is big enough, you lose your engineer ceo from the startup phase and they are replaced with conventional business people. The worst kind is the kind like musk, who think they are an engineer.\n\nThe responses you're claiming are confidently incorrect are responding to a post with the opening thesis:\n\n> Evidence that Musk is the Chief Engineer of SpaceX\n\nHe is not lead or chief engineer. That title has specific meaning in engineering roles. Musk is not stamping designs in an engineering capacity. It is not confidently incorrect to point out that it is delusional to believe he is.\n\nNote: if he is, that is literally illegal. He has no ABET accredited engineering degree nor the PE that would allow him to do that.",

I think a lot of people think I must spend a lot of time with media or on businessy things*. But actually almost all my time, like 80% of it, is spent on engineering and design.* Engineering and design, so it's developing next-generation product. That's 80% of it.\n\nInterviewer: You probably don't remember this. A very long time ago, many, many, years, you took me on a tour of SpaceX. And the most impressive thing was that you knew every detail of the rocket and every piece of engineering that went into it. And I don't think many people get that about you.\n\nElon: Yeah. I think a lot of people think I'm kind of a business person or something, which is fine. Business is fine. But really it's like at SpaceX, Gwynne Shotwell is Chief Operating Officer. She manages legal, finance, sales, and general business activity. And then my time is almost entirely with the engineering team, working on improving the Falcon 9 and our Dragon spacecraft and developing the Mars Colonial architecture. At Tesla, it's working on the Model 3 and, yeah, so I'm in the design studio, take up a half a day a week, dealing with aesthetics and look-and-feel things. And then most of the rest of the week is just going through engineering of the car itself as well as engineering of the factory. Because the biggest epiphany I've had this year is that what really matters is the machine that builds the machine, the factory. And that is at least two orders of magnitude harder than the vehicle itself.\n\nsource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnBQmEqBCY0",

Notice the 4 semesters of calculus that are standard for all engineering/physics degrees?\nhttps://catalog.upenn.edu/undergraduate/programs/physics-business-technology-ba/",

You also need it for a BS in economics, which I'm surprised you didn't pick up on.\n\nYes, I'm actively trying to devalue musk's education.",

So rare that I have to ask, are you including people who lie on resumes about having a degree?\n\nThis is simply false. I have at least a dozen friends and old coworkers in engineering fields at FAANNG companies (omitting the other big N seems silly), and less than half of them have degrees. Nobody is falsifying their resumes.\n\n> Show me one FAANG Software Engineer job posting that doesn\u2019t require a degree.\n\nWhat it says on a job posting for education isn't a hard requirement. It is to weed out bad applicants, or feed into resume processing systems, or tell the recruiting person who *doesn't know much about the position they're hiring for* to make it easier for them to pick good candidates. Anyone with experience can still apply and land jobs if their resume is solid enough.\n\nI have interviewed at three separate FAANNG companies for engineering roles, yet I have never applied to one. My resume shows I attended a local community college and don't hold a degree, I have no grades posted, no special certificates or anything like that, but I have 15 years experience showing results at large companies. I've gone through the whole several weeks of interviews and tests and presentations. I passed on two separate offers, because while the money offered was great, the cultures of them seemed stuffy and dull compared to what I ended up going with.\n\nEven my current engineering role has a degree requirement, its my *experience* that was attractive enough to get into the interviewing role, and my *ability to answer and complete all of their questions and challenges* that got me the jobs. I've been there almost two years and I'm surrounded by people with serious degrees, we all teach each other things every single day.\n\nMy other good friends have done even better than I have without degrees, because they were willing to relocate and I refuse to do that.\n\nYou act like the internet hasn't been available to people for the last 30 years. That getting a degree in a compsci tract (that's probably years behind what's modern in many ways) is superior to someone who's talented and driven and wants to learn. Unless you're in a very specialized field, all I see a degree as is a proof that you are willing to suffer a bit and follow directions to complete a task, which is actually a great trait in itself.",

Like, the guy that runs a train is an engineer. A civil engineer and a mechanical engineer are wildly different things. In a very broad sense, anyone that develops solutions to problems can be considered an engineer, and in a slightly more narrow sense, anyone that makes money doing it.\n\nConversely, earning a doctorate is a lot less broad.\n\nEDIT: Wow, look at that wall of text.

Anyway, an \u201cengineer\u201d is actually a legally protected title and typically requires a 4-year diploma + 2 years of work experience at the minimum (depending on the jurisdiction of practice). Without rules in place on who can call themselves an engineer, things can go very very wrong (think buildings/bridges collapsing, airplanes crashing, ships sinking, etc). It just so happens that these rules are not typically enforced in computer science because relatively very very few software engineering positions actually deal with mission/safety critical systems.\n\n> anyone that develops solutions to problems can be considered an engineer\n\nYou\u2019re dead wrong here. Besides the legal aspect I explained above, that definition implies that every living person on the planet is an engineer in some form or another, which is insulting to actual engineers. Again, it\u2019s like saying you\u2019re a doctor because you know how to apply a bandaid or administer a vaccine. Any idiot off the street can go to coding bootcamp and learn to code. Engineering encompasses much much more than just coding.",

I'm not going to die on the hill of \"Elon Musk is *definitely* an engineer\", but it seems kind of silly to make such a big fuss about him *not* being an engineer.",

Have a mechanical engineering degree and apart from showing up for a test in university, I have had no exposure to the licensing process. I don't think I even know/work with any licensed engineers.

And I said, \u201cWell, on smaller engines, we\u2019d go face-shutoff, but nobody\u2019s done it on a really large engine. It\u2019ll be really difficult.\u201d And he said, \u201cWe need to do face-shutoff. Explain how that works?\u201d So I drew it up, did some, you know, sketches, and said \u201chere\u2019s what we\u2019d do,\u201d and he said \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to do.\u201d And I advised him against it; I said it\u2019s going to be too hard to do, and it\u2019s not going to save that much. But he made the decision that we were going to do face-shutoff.\n\n> So we went and developed that engine; and it was hard. We blew up a lot of hardware. And we tried probably tried a hundred different combinations to make it work; but we made it work. I still have the original sketch I did; I think it was\u2014 what was it, Christmas 2011, when I did that sketch? And it\u2019s changed quite a bit from that original sketch, but it was pretty scary for me, knowing how that hardware worked, but by going face-shutoff, we got rid of the main valves, we got rid of the sequencing computer; basically, you spin the pumps and pressure comes up, the pressure opens the main injector, lets the oxygen go first, and then the fuel comes in. So all you gotta time is the ignitor fluid. So if you have the ignitor fluid going, it\u2019ll light, and it\u2019s not going to hard start. That got rid of the problem we had where you have two valves; the oxygen valve and the fuel valve. The oxygen valve is very cold and very stiff; it doesn\u2019t want to move. And it\u2019s the one you want open first. If you relieve the fuel, it\u2019s what\u2019s called a hard start. In fact, we have an old saying that says, \u201c[inaudible][When you start a rocket engine, a thousand things could happen, and only one of those is good]\u201c, and by having sequencing correctly, you can get rid of about 900 of those bad things, we made these engine very reliable, got rid of a lot of mass, and got rid of a lot of costs. And it was the right thing to do.\n\n> And now we have the lowest-cost, most reliable engines in the world. And it was basically because of that decision, to go to do that. \n\nThere are many other examples, some in this topic: https://old.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/k1e0ta/evidence_that_musk_is_the_chief_engineer_of_spacex/",

If you spend time at work using auto cad to develop a component for starship, you\u2019re an engineer. Any reasonable person would agree with that. \n\nThe primary reason you need a license in the US varies by state but typically involves the nature of the engineering work you\u2019re doing. Specifically, if you\u2019re designing a structure/facility or if your product/work is going to be available for the public to purchase. \n\nSo legally, if I hire an engineer to design a house for me, that engineer needs to be licensed (and for obvious safety reasons). Industrial exemption (which is what SpaceX uses) just means their engineers are producing work that won\u2019t effect the public and the company is ultimately liable for any accidents that happen.",

A building requires a PE which is a licensed engineer mainly because we have pretty strict building codes for safety reasons. \n\nIn aerospace (like SpaceX) you get an industrial exemption because the company is what assumes liability for failures instead of an individual. So in that case, the bar is set cooperatively between what the company has to offer and what the customer hiring the company is willing to agree to. \n\nSo for example, the F35 is a product that I\u2019m certain you wouldn\u2019t argue against being an *engineering* marvel. Millions of man hours were spent on making this. Many, if not the majority of the engineers who worked on it probably were not certified as \u201cprofessional engineers\u201d and frankly they don\u2019t need to be. The reason why is the company documents the work they did, and the government (customer) is able to independently verify that the work was done correctly by reviewing the performance over a variety of different criteria. \n\nIndustrial exemption applies here because the product being engineered isn\u2019t a facility and it isn\u2019t available to the public. \n\nLet\u2019s put it this way. If I had management degree and went to Antarctica voluntarily to conduct scientific research on marine biology, it would be right and appropriate to call me a scientist even though I don\u2019t have a stem degree. \n\nYou can work at a company and produce a lot of \u201cengineering work\u201d (mathematical optimization and design to list a couple examples) and would rightfully be called an engineer. You couldn\u2019t go outside of that company and try to market your ability to do engineering work independently to the public. But you would be right to call yourself and be called by others an \u201cengineer\u201d. There\u2019s just some liability restrictions that apply if you wanted to independently market yourself and sell engineering services.",

But those with degrees and liscenses can do it all the time regardless of where they currently work? Seems like an incredibly confusing and non useful way to organize the titles. Would be far more useful to gatekeep PEs as PEs, those with degrees as engineers, and those without as \u201cdesigners\u201d or a number of other titles.

He is integrally involved in the actual design and engineering of the rocket, and at least touches every other aspect of the business (but I would say the former takes up much more of his mental real estate). Elon is an engineer at heart, and that\u2019s where and how he works best.",

They do not have the same pedigree of practice or profession. The problem is software folks coopting the term \"engineer\" when they have no place doing so.\n\nI don't quite agree with that. There just isn't the same level of accreditation and oversight for software engineering. The path to becoming a software engineer is essentially finishing an undergrad in computer science. Only some countries, that I'm aware of, have further accreditation beyond post secondary education and even then it's not really enforced in the workplace. Sure, there are some industries that would prefer their software engineers have additional/specific education (firmware, for example) but the majority do not. \n\nSince the entry point is so low, it's not really possible to tell the level of skill a candidate has based on whether they call themselves a software engineer or a developer or programmer. I've worked with plenty of software engineers that were terrible practically since, well, all they had was their undergrad and little actual experience. \n\nThe term \"software engineer\" just doesn't carry the same weight that other engineering titles do. It conveys very little about the person's actual skill level. \n\nI understand your distaste for the software world diluting the title of \"engineer\" and I'm not arguing against it. Personally, I would totally support a more strict accreditation body for the right to use the title of \"software engineer\". Is that how it should be? Yeah, probably. Is that the way it is now? Absolutely not.",

Engineering stamps make a single person liable, and that person can be strung up when they authorize something they shouldn't. \n\n*That* person then has a compelling reason to not sign off on a faulty design. I'm not a fan of the idea that everyone in an organization can just blame someone else and therefore it's nobody's fault that 300 people died. When people's lives can be put at risk by a design, there should be a specific individual responsible for making sure the design does not kill people, who can be blamed later if they didn't exercise the proper oversight and can't pass the buck to someone else. The engineering licensing system is what ensures this is the case for some fields like civil engineering. In my opinion it should be expanded significantly.\n\nI disagree with your claim that liability wouldn't have affected their decisions. I believe the possibility of going to jail for egregious negligence helps motivate people to not make bad decisions because their corporate bosses want them to. Just because in the end, they likely wouldn't go to jail, doesn't mean the possibility won't motivate anyone.",

It's rather annoying because the system of gatekeeping exists and is enforced specifically so that when safety is important, you can hire a professional called an \"engineer\" with legal liability for a bad design.

Meanwhile i was fresh out of school and had the title and the money, and they were teaching me everything i knew.

If he asks you a question, you learn very quickly not to go give him a gut reaction.\n\n> He wants answers that get down to the fundamental laws of physics. One thing he understands really well is the physics of the rockets. He understands that like nobody else. The stuff I have seen him do in his head is crazy.\n\n> He can get in discussions about flying a satellite and whether we can make the right orbit and deliver Dragon at the same time and solve all these equations in real time.

Me and a 20 year machinist show up and first comment is the tooling they are using isn\u2019t right for the application. No wonder they couldn\u2019t hold tolerance!

Definitely possible to work your way into degreed positions and get to the top. Engineering would certainly be one of the industries where this is possible.\n\nJust another post proving how ignorant and biased people are when they want to justify their hate towards someone.",

Such person does not have the final authority to approve or the ultimate responsibility for, engineering designs, plans or specifications that are to be: (A) incorporated into fixed works, systems or facilities on the property of others; or (B) made available to the public. These individuals are prohibited from representing an ability or willingness to perform engineering services or make an engineering judgment requiring a licensed professional engineer, engage in practice of engineering, offer engineering services directly to the public and/or other businesses; unless the business entity is registered with the state's board of engineering and the practice is carried on/supervised directly only by engineers licensed to engage in the practice of engineering.\"\n\nIn summary, Elon is only allowed to throw the word Engineer around at all because he employs actual engineers. If it's just him starting a sole proprietorship, he would not be allowed to use the word at all.",

Nothing you said is wrong, but it isn\u2019t really what we\u2019re talking about. Specifically, it appears the block quote you\u2019re using is essentially referencing structural work. See part A and B that gives specifics on that. \n\nWhich is what I said (structural engineer). the work SpaceX is doing doesn\u2019t fall within the criteria your citing because A.) rockets aren\u2019t facilities and B.) they aren\u2019t available/being sold to the public. SpaceX definitely has PEs signing off on their facilities. But probably not on their rockers. It\u2019s funny you\u2019re calling me confidently incorrect when you aren\u2019t even critically comprehending the sources you\u2019re citing. \n\nYou can\u2019t claim to be a \u201cprofessional engineer\u201d without proper certification. This is true. That\u2019s a specific thing with specific criteria outlined in the source you provided. Some states have narrower guidelines and many countries also have narrower guidelines. But within the context of the US as a whole, you can be considered an engineer without a certification depending on the field you work in. This is allowed because of industrial exemption essentially allows any company to engage in engineering work so long as it\u2019s not public in nature. \n\nSomeone else wrote a comment that I think puts it best. \n\n\u201cA lot of people here are way too focused on credentialism\u201d \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have an engineering degree and thus he isn\u2019t an engineer is what this post is asserting. I contest that view as being myopic at best and deliberately obtuse at worst. At least within the context of him working inside the US.\nSpecifically because of industrial exemption, he can claim to be an engineer at SpaceX as the company would be liable if any decisions he made were bad. SpaceX does not need a PE to sign off on their work as they fall in aerospace. \n\nAnd let\u2019s be big brain here\u2026.. even if I did need an signature from a PE, if I do a bunch of \u201cengineering\u201d work on auto cad and that work gets signed off by a professional engineer, does that invalidate my work??? Clearly not. You\u2019re still an engineer doing engineering work. You just don\u2019t have the license to sign off on it. Which again is only necessary in certain fields under certain criteria.",

In all states, one cannot offer services to the public as an engineer without being licensed--so I agree with you in terms of internal workings within his own private company. \n\nMy main beef is basically that the whole origin of this post is some member of the public advertising him basically as the definition of a (or even the best ever) engineer. I would hope that you would agree with me that if he is entitled to use the word engineer, it is by exception (because I do not deny that he is exceptional and done exceptional things). \n\nThe crux is that being ABLE to do something is not the same as BEING something. I may know the law inside and out and be able to say how to win a case and be 100% correct, but the second I give legal advice and portray myself as a lawyer I'm breaking the law because I'm not licensed. I don't deny that in some cases this may be very unfair (like many overseas doctors' credentials not being recognized and not allowed to practice, but I think most of us can recognise the risk associated with being too inclusive in that regard).\n\nI appreciate your standpoint and you keeping me in check, though.

You can't say something positive about Elon without being called a stan and a cuck. Steve Jobs wasn't a saint and he wasn't a devil, he was a guy who was a businessman. He didn't directly design the iPhone or any of the Apple Products because that wasn't his fucking job. He did awesome stuff and he did shitty stuff and he did meh stuff. Elon Musk isn't just the face of Tesla and SpaceX, he is largely responsible for the direction of the company and even making the final decision on big engineering decisions. He absolutely DOES understand the broadstrokes and even a lot of the finer ones when it comes to the workings of his products, as you can tell in many interviews, the man loves talking shop with other engineers and many engineers who have worked with him have said he is very competent.\n\nHe's also an asshole and can be a douchebag tyrannical employer and absolutely shouldn't be on Twitter talking about other subjects and has made some stupid business decisions and been overconfident about things he actually DOESN'T know about. \n\nHES ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

Hate to break it to you, I\u2019m not an Elon stan. \n\nThe snark while you do it is icing on the cake.",

Try to follow a train of thought maybe?\n\nTom Mueller is a propulsion specialist and headed that specific team, and much more than that goes into a rocket. The chief engineer oversees all those other aspects and that was, you guessed it, Elon. Tom's even been retired for the most part since 2014, so his influence has been replaced by Will Heltsley. Tom didn't even have anything to do with SpaceX's current raptor engine.\n\nIf you care to actually learn anything about Elon, instead of blindly assuming he does nothing of merit only because he has political views which hurt your feelings, then you'd know that there's a very public figure who ACTUALLY runs the business-side of SpaceX. Gwynne Shotwell, and since 2008 to boot. \n\nIt's widely known that she runs the business, and Elon spends his time at the company consulting with the engineering folks. Hate him because he's not on your political team, but there's no denying the guy likes designing things and is rather good at it.\n\nMaybe try sticking to discussions you actually know anything about?",

It would appear your college degree didn't translate to even-adequate levels of reading comprehension.\n\nHe stepped away and had little to no involvement beginning in 2014. Seeing as how he was a founding member of the company, it's very easy to understand that would come with specific perks such as keeping your position + entitlements without showing up to work. \n\nAs I explicitly said, he led the propulsion team until he didn't. He didn't beginning in 2016, which is when Will officially took over the role. How have any of these pathetic \"gotcha's\" proved anything I said to be wrong? Think on it for a moment and you might see that they haven't.\n\n>Elon has a Bachelor of Arts in Physics, not even a BS degree.\n\nSo, you're legitimately retarded enough to believe that colleges are the gatekeepers to any knowledge, on any subject? He could have a degree in lesbian dance theory and it would still have no bearing on what he currently does or does not know about aerospace engineering. Even still, physics is rather fundamental when it comes to designing rockets. It would appear you didn't know that. You'd have been much better off not mentioning his college education at all. It only served to hurt your own point my guy.\n\nAnd if simply acknowledging the facts about Elon's engineering involvements is me putting his balls in my mouth, then you blindly hating him because he likely won't cast a ballot you like must be you giving Joe Biden a rimjob.\n\nI can assure you, you're not following. And you've failed to correct me on anything.",

Will Heltsley has the same credentials, albeit from more prestigious institutions. *They are both engineers*.\n\nThe fortunate reality is that certain professions are gatekept by accredited institutions of learning so that graduates have a degree that tells the world they have earned the ability to do the work. It's not impossible to become an engineer through work experience but the reasons why a degree is necessary are extremely simple.\n\nIt's not a gotcha to say Elon Musk is not an engineer, it's just a fact. He's not.\n\nP.S. My point about Elon's degree is that it's a BA in Physics, not a BS.\n\nP.S.S. Praise Tom and Will to the end of the earth and back, they deserve it.

I**t**   \n**requires the exercise of original thought and judgement and the ability to supervise the technical and administrative work of others**. His/her education will have been such **as to make him/her capable of closely and continuously following progress in his/her branch of engineering science** by consulting newly published works on a worldwide basis, assimilating such information and applying it independently. He/she i**s thus placed in a position to make contributions to the development of engineering science or its applications.** His/her education and training will have   \nbeen such that **he/she will have acquired a broad and general**   \n**appreciation of the engineering sciences as well as thorough insight**   \n**into the special features of his/her own branch**. In due time he/she **will**  \n **be able to give authoritative technical advice and to assume**   \n**responsibility for the direction of important tasks in his/her branch.**\n\nTherefore by definition he is not a *professional* engineer, but the terms \"lead designer, CTO\" imply also that he is technically an engineer, that you like it or not. \n\nNext you'll tell me that people like Gates and Zuckenberg and thousands of other people in the silicon valley don't know how to code because they have not a formal education in coding",

No engineer is doing it all, there is too much to do.\n\nElon, if nothing else, is absolutely fulfilling design aspects of engineering, and certainly could be involved in signing off on the designs of other engineers even if it\u2019s not official, that millions of other engineers do worldwide. Anyone who knows anything about what he does at SpaceX, and did at Tesla (and maybe still does), knows that Elon is intimately involved in the design and troubleshooting processes. On top of that he does management work, and likely provides input on procurement.\n\nA lot of people have a very narrow perception of an engineer, and it shows. An engineer isn\u2019t just that guy leaning over an IFC drawing he stamped with a ruler in hand while wearing a hardhat. \n\nJust listen to a technical discussion about rockets or Tesla manufacturing with Elon, and you\u2019ll know he probably knows as much, if not more, about rocket science/engineering or car manufacturing than most other engineers working in those industries.\n\nThat all said, he\u2019s probably got a screw loose, but that\u2019s probably just him on the spectrum to some extent. Put a guy like that on very public platforms and you get Elon.",

Switching the global fleet to BEV is far from the smallest change that can be made. It's actually a great piece of low hanging fruit, hence why it's happening. The development of BEVs also helps with the development of clean transit buses and heavy trucks, which won't ever be phased out. \n\nMoving away from cars is something that needs to be done and governments should be spending on building out public transit as much as possible. That said, the climate crisis is an eminent threat and needs to be addressed far faster than transitioning away from cars. Please don't let the good be the enemy of perfect, there's no time for that. \n\nYou're giving him far too much credit if you think he somehow has killed any transit projects, that's pretty ridiculous. Hyperloop was an engineering contest for students, basically a recruitment drive for his companies.\n\nThe Boring company is trying to develop a method to reduce the cost of tunneling; there's no requirement for those tunnels to have Teslas in them. I'm not sure if they'll actually succeed, but if they do, this will help public transit adoption massively. My city has one of North America's best public transportation networks, but our current 3 mile, 5 station Metro extension is costing more than $5B USD and will take 10 years to complete. Boring's Vegas demo loop cost $50 million for one mile and 3 stops and took about a year to dig. If they can scale up to subway sized tunnels for 10x that cost, it'll be a huge win.",

There are tens (or hundreds?) of thousands of Senior Software Engineers in my home state of Georgia alone, and we're not exactly Silicon Valley over here. We're not that special, and neither is he -- he's just got a lot of daddy's apartheid money to pay lawyers.\n2. All great minds must have at least _one_ decision or idea that counts as brilliant, otherwise there's no basis for calling them a \"great mind\". Musk still hasn't had one. He's just had a lot of money, and a lot of _actual_ great minds on his payroll, while he pretends to have been involved somehow. He's not Tesla, he's Edison.",

Do you agree, then, that Elon Musk is no more special than your average software engineer? Or are you still asserting that he's \"a great mind\"?\n\nBy the way, did you know [he didn't start Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.#Founding_(2003%E2%80%932004))? Of course, the _actual founders_ are not legally allowed to tell you that, even though it's easily-researched history, [because Musk fought them in court to force them to call him a \"co-founder\" of Tesla even though he wasn't.](https://www.cnet.com/culture/tesla-motors-founders-now-there-are-five/)\n\nHe's a \"genius\" only in the same way Donald Trump is a \"genius\": he has enough of his daddy's money to get away with pushing people around, and enough of a cult following that people eat up his lies no matter how blatant.\n\nSpaceX? Sure, he founded that...[after visiting Moscow with a CIA rep in the middle of a situation where the US Government wanted to pressure Russia into behaving better on a missile defense treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX#2001%E2%80%932004:_Founding). My guess based on Musk's \"all fluff, no stuff\" track record is that he was fed that idea too, as a way of weakening the US's dependence on Russia's space program.",

That is a an opinion.\n\nWith a good idea, and a ridiculous amount luck, you could start a billion dollar company. Many people have. Succesful companies don't have to exploit their workers, or \"cheat\". There are many billion dallar companies which are succesful without being evil. Maesk and LEGO are two example, and I could give you countless other. \n\nOf course there are also the Amazons and Nestl\u00e9s of the world. But I think they are the product of a broken system, much more than that of evil people.\n\nBillionaires don't just have Scrooge McDuck style vaults where they hoard their wealth. The wealth consists of the assets, usually in the form of shares in the companies they founded or invested in. Many live rather modest lifestyle, not all of course, many don't. But in my opinion saying that being a billionaire makes you a bad person, is like saying all unemployed people are lazy. I don't believe you can judge someones character, solely on their financial status.\n\nThat said Elon is an asshat, but not because he is rich, neither is he rich because he is an asshat. Rich people are often asshats, but mostly they are just regular people, with more money.",

In 1988, after obtaining a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory military service and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the United States.](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elon-Musk)\n\nElon and other family members have opened up about years of living in debt after they left South Africa.\n\n1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics and economics in 1997\n\nIn 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. it is claimed that the Musks' father, Errol Musk, provided them with US$28,000 during this time,[6]:\u200aCh.4\u200a but Elon Musk later denied this.[8] He later clarified that his dad provided around 10% of US$200,000 as part of a later funding round. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.\n\nIn 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A third rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing Company\u2019s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the cost.\n\nTesla Motors was formed to develop an electric sports car. Eberhard was Tesla\u2019s chief executive officer (CEO) and Tarpenning its chief financial officer (CFO). Funding for the company was obtained from a variety of sources, most notably PayPal cofounder Elon Musk, who contributed more than $30 million to the new venture and served as chairman of the company, beginning in 2004.\n\nIn 2008 Tesla Motors released its first car, the completely electric Roadster.",

A static webpage is a \"base\" website, and that doesn't run any code server-side at all. When you access a website, you download most of what you need for it, and most of the code is usually running on *your* pc.\n\nThe discord app and website in your example are surprisingly different behind the scenes. There's a bit more going on under the hood in an electron app that isn't part of the website at all. The website isn't doing file i/o, installs, registry read/write, accessing hardware, etc.. Your browser is what's doing those things and giving them to the website.",

Nope (not yet anyway). No other company was even looking at reusability until SpaceX did it. It was deemed not possible or at least not financially possible.\n\nIs any other company working on a _fully_ reusable heavy lift rocket? Here is a hint: nope.\n\n> and he does it in an undisciplined fashion \n\nWhat are you talking about here?\n\n> and delivers no scientific benefit!\n\nSpaceX has in fact launched lots of scientific payloads (including the DART mission that NASA just crashed into an asteroid). And they also launch astronauts to the ISS where they do tons of scientific research.\n\n> Sure is cool that he launched a car into space though, isn\u2019t it? Derp!\n\nWhen rocket companies test their rockets they usually launch a big chunk of concrete into space. Elon/SpaceX decided to have a little fun with their mass simulator. What is wrong with that?\n\n>  And in case you didn\u2019t notice, nobody drives self-driving cars.\n\nTechnology usually moves in iterative steps, the airplane after the Wright brother's flyer was not the Concorde. It isn't going to happen overnight, but they are working towards it.\n\nCars wouldn't moving towards electrification now if it wasn't for Elon Musk and Tesla.",

The elon haters and lovers seem to be pretty divided on what hes actually done and dont really look at it objectively because his personality is so polarizing. First, no one has landed on mars he working towards that and thats been his goal neither has any other space agency sponsered by their government like nasa( but they still collaborate and share resources) the rockets designed by space x have been tested and used by nasa and vice versa. \n\nHe didnt need to invent electric cars to take credit for popularizing and making them RELATIVELY more reasonable and convenient. Until tesla was a big car brand all other EVs were shit because no other car company saw a need to actually focus on them when everyone didnt mind using gas vehicles. After tesla started making Evs with features that were cool and convenient like 300 mile range, fast charging and high tech is when everyone started actually taking them seriously and its when other companies saw a market for them. Self driving technology has always been in development and hes never advertised it as being completely ready, but most other car companies already have some sort of self driving feature shipping with their newer models (because tesla already showed them thats a desirable future). \n\nElon musk is actually the head engineer at space x and its been well documented on multiple occasions, there is no debate about that all it takes is a quick google search. \n\nThis whole comment section strikes me as being dick ridey or blind mob like. Elon musk isnt god and hes not brain dead either, hes a guy who trolls the entirety of the internet for fun and happens to be decently smart. People ignore the fact that outside of the internet and media he has contributed to many things and has made multiple successful business endeavors.",

I like physics better too! It doesnt make it the same thing) and he doesn't *do* engineering either - he's a freaking businessman. He's an idea man who word vomits ideas into the nether and makes actual engineers do it and most of them are fucking bad. And you must know different people who work with him than I do, because the ones I know say he's a dingus as well as a douche. I'm also basing my opinion on the fact that a lot of his \"winning ideas\" are fucking stupid. The fucking loop is just public transportation, reinvented but worse. It transports less people than a proper subway, more slowly, and more expensively. It was blatantly just an excuse to try out his fancy drill. And the tunnels! The tunnels are a safety nightmare, too small for emegency vehicles, and they are slower than your average bus. There's a *reason* engineers building subsurface transportation make them wider, and its because of *fire*. SpaceX is an environmental disaster, and a menace upon the city in which its housed, and focused in the wrong direction. It's wrong headed and arrogant to say that our only hope is to colonize another planet and takes away time and resources from the fight to save this one. Tesla's aggressive advertising campaign over the electric car industry has made electric cars a luxury when we should be making them more accessible, and the two patents he has are for their handles, which always break, and for their chargers and their charging ports are literally part oft he reason why theyre driving out of business *better* more affordable electric vehicles. They've overtaken their charging stations, lobbied against other companies attempts to make new ones, and only Teslas can use their propietary chargers. And don't get me started on the \"self driving\" feature. People act like Tesla invented the fucking electric car, and they damn well didn't, better and more affordable ones existed before and continue to exist since, and even if they did Elon is not actually the founder of Tesla! He purchased the title of \"founder of Tesla\" from the people who actually founded it, after they had already created their product. \n\nPlus at the end of the day he's just fucking dumb. He claimed that tunnels aren't affected by flooding because they're immune to the above ground weather! That's fucking basic civil and soil engineering shit. Its basic *common sense* shit. Plus he's a transphobe, and yeah, a douche, and his cult of personality is fucking stupid. The only thing he's actually good at is advertising, which is why so many people believe his bullshit. \n\nNow you may disagree with my opinion on all these things, but there, thats what I base my opinion on.",

With how progressively we deal with the ideas though there is little effectiveness. I have been involved in building homeless shelters.

That\u2019s just arguing semantics, if you do the work of an engineer and you\u2019re recognized as one, then you\u2019re an engineer",

A professional Engineer is typically, is a person registered under an Engineering Council which is widely accepted.\n\nThe first sentence literally says that an engineer is a person practices the engineering principals listed as a profession. Nothing about being accredited or anything. \n\nIt then goes on to state the etymological Origin of the word. Again nothing about being accredited or anything. \n\nBoth of those portions imply that engineer is simply a person who uses engineering principals to solve complex problems. \n\nI\u2019m assuming you\u2019re reading the next portions and are using that as a basis for your flawed definition. However, you should notice that it says \u201ctypically include\u201d. That means there are people who are engineers who don\u2019t meet those typical qualifications. That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not engineers. \n\nThe last portion, is completely unheard of to me. In the US I am not aware of anyone who is registered with some governing board to be considered an engineer.",

Weird ay? And still I am active as consultant in one of the biggest accelerator programs in SV for design and marketing. Occassionally doing some web dev stuff, yet I could totally work professionally.). Most people who are highly skilled nowadays with much experience are autodidacts, you know why? Because web dev and progressive tech development is born in the internet and is barely two decades old. It's easily 50-50 of devs in SV of being academically trained and self-taught.\n\nEsepcially developement industry is filled with self-taught professionals.\n\nIt's just a thing of the recent past maybe 5-7 years since CS got such a huge influx of popularity that it became a sought-after subject to study. Unfortunately, as now you have a huge mass of incompetent graduates who didn't even use a PC before studying.\n\nBut, let's be honest, the past 7 years is most certainly already into your teens, so you wouldn't know and thus you end up, once again in your exchanges, stating something entirely unfound.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEngineer is again a term describing a profession, that is it. The whole statement of \"engineer is a qualification\" makes entirely no conclusive sense. It's grammatically and semantically entirely nonsensical.\n\nThe degree is a qualification expressing the holders acknowledged knowledge aggregation for the relevant subject fields. The \"name\" is not a qualification, it's neither a title. It's just a role just like, once again, developer is.\n\nI think you can't follow my statement on so many levels, thus this once again found an  end here as well.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAddendum: You lack all kinds of comprehension skills displayed in you still don't understand how to use quotes  nor paragraphs. And you also seem to not care to aquire that knowledge... weird, ay? Ah, nah it isn't, because we already know, you personally, you only learn from people  who tell you something, not on your own.",

You can just teach that yourself. All the knowledge is availabel everywhere. How you get to practice experience is a different issue.\n\nIf you learn all that stuff and you invent stuff in your garage and even patent that, and then get rich of that patent. That person is a fuckin engineer.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is not a question of societally established standards. It's a logic discussion. If you practice something and got  the knowledge to do something, you are that something. If you wear soccer shoes and you go onto a soccer field, and you play with a soccer ball with some other people, you are a soccer player. If you can be a professional soccer player is a different question. If you qualify to compete, is a different question. How you practice it and with how much enthusiasm you learn, aggregate knowledge and physical capabilities, got nothing to do with that.\n\nIf you get acknowledged by local structures is an entirely different discussion.",

What happened last year was that the cumulative profit exceeded the cumulative spending of the past. It required a few profitable years to dig out of the past hole that all new companies have from early investments.\n\nYou sound like you listen to Gordon Johnson. That is why you have the strange belief that profits came from selling emission credits. The have had years of profits with emissions credits only making up a small portion of that profit.\n\nEvery Tesla offsets it's manufacturing emissions in a short time frame. Usually in under one year. So you are completely wrong about the pollution of manufacturing a Tesla. You are likely making the same mistake people like Gordon do and using industry averages from ICE vehicle manufacturing to judge the pollution from manufacturing a Tesla. The fact is Tesla is revolutionising how vehicles are manufactured.\n\nPlease do actual research instead of listening to loud mouthed fools.",

That is a popular conspiracy theory on this sub though.\n\nCompetition is coming finally? Why is it legacy car makers couldn't just supposedly take government money and produce EV's as well? Why is it start ups have an easier time making EV's than legacy companies? You really are not paying attention if you think Tesla will become niche.\n\nTesla will likely be the only American auto manufacturer left unless the government bails out GM and Ford many more billions. Ford has a chance, but GM is a dead company only living off government bailouts. Japan auto manufacturers will likely disappear as well since they are gambling on hydrogen. China and Tesla will probably be the only car makers.",

Most of the complaints about build quality are complaints about the superficial issues. Their circuit boards look like they came from the defense industry. Their battery management and thermal systems and general configurations are all industry leading.\n\nYes, the Boring company is irrelevant. It is a side issue at most that he doesn't put much time into. Their main accomplishment is making a faster cheaper boring system. The high speed rail thing is an old non issue. The high-speed rail won the contract and is being built now.\n\nTraditional banking also relies on data centers. This contributes to traditional banking requiring at least tree times more energy than Bitcoin. I understand the mining quite well, and I see that energy requirement as a great form of security in that blockchain. All that matters is that the energy is clean, not the amount. There is nothing wrong with increasing our energy usage many times over as long as that energy is clean and sustainable. Many miners tend to look to be near hydro electric sources. This is why judging Bitcoin purely by energy used, and not considering the energy source, makes it look worse than it is. Most of the coal powered miners are in China.",

I think the consequences of mining are often pretty severe and any technology that can help move away or minimize its need is always going to be the best solution.  My largest hope is asteroid mining, although I do realize how far- fetched it really is.

It does require a small group of people to orchestrate and lead the team to accomplish these goals and someone who had to visualize the end product before its built by the brilliant humans. Sometimes ideas fail and others change the world. If you dont try then nothing will change.\n\nAlso he is a software engineer and built an online payment company that then merged with another to make PayPal.\n\nAlso has 3 patents he designed and are used in the products he sells. Plenty of people are engineers without a degree. If you can do the job most company will hire you and give you the title of engineer. Portfolios matter more than degrees in product development.",

Any decent engineer knows that more harm can come than good if you go into projects like a wrecking ball (source: I'm aN eNgIneEr). \n\nYall can suck him off as much as you want, it doesn't mean he isn't an awful person.

He does plenty enough bad stuff in his social life to hate on that you don't need to invent reasons to dislike him.    \n   \nHe has his name on more patents than the majority of engineers (the majority have none). That's not even the metric for being an engineer btw. Anyone that brought that up is a full on moron that we should be surprised is even able to write let alone be able to make a false equivalence between having patents and being an engineer. He was the sole software engineer on software that was a precursor to software almost all of us use every single day. He knows and intelligently discusses engineering and physics in GREAT DETAIL! There are videos of this, you can go watch instead of crying on the internet about how someone isn't an engineer just because you don't like them.    \n   \nNo need to be insecure just because he's intellectually superior to you. You're superior to him in an infinite number of ways. Everyone is different. We all have things we're good, bad, and meh at. Maybe don't get so hung up on what some stranger is about, and focus instead on your own strengths and how you can beat use them.",

Especially by people who don't work in any engineering industry. *Engineer* is a vague term that could mean a magnitude of different professions. So much so that you could be a mathematician and solve mechanical engineering problems for a company and be considered an engineer. \n\nAlso, a medical license cannot be compared to an engineering degree. It would help if you had a permit to be a medical doctor. You do not need a right to be an engineer. Now for specific titles, especially in the Civil Engineering field, licensing is required, but in most engineering fields, it is not. For example, I'm paying for my undergraduate studies while working in a software engineering position; I haven't graduated yet; am I not an engineer?",

Starship (once complete) can perform the same jobs as the SLS with better performance, more frequently, and at a fraction of a fraction of the cost.

A 3-stage Saturn V has a mass of 2,965 t and an LEO payload of 140 t. SpaceX Heavy has a mass of 1,421 t and an LEO payload of 64 t. So Saturn V scales fairly well against SpaceX, at a bit over twice the weight and capacity.\n\nThe real benefit of SpaceX is cost. But there are other commercial providers that are also competitive and who have been in business far longer than SpaceX.",

The Space Shuttle first flew 41 years ago. Of course one expects technology to advance over that long period of time. Ariane V, Vega, Antares, Long March, Electron, GSLV, etc., all contributed gradual improvements in the evolution of rocket technology. SpaceX is just another contributor. This not a revolution.

(someone like Michael Reeves worked as a software engineer for years, and he doesn't have a degree) Yale also offered Musk an \"honorary doctorate\" in engineering and technology, and is an elected member of the NAE. I'd argue that national institutions that recognize engineers giving Musk recognition as one means at least something beyond a publicity stunt.\n\nSure, he's mostly focused on business managing, but with his background in physics, and the work he's done outside of business management, he's recognized as somewhat of an engineer, granted, mostly in a similar way to Edison. Because of that, I wouldn't personally call him an engineer, (and he's DEFINITELY far from the \"greatest of all time\" if you do consider him to be one) but I'd argue the \"At all\" part of your statement is wrong.",

The elon haters and lovers seem to be pretty divided on what hes actually done and dont really look at it objectively because his personality is so polarizing. First, no one has landed on mars he working towards that and thats been his goal neither has any other space agency sponsered by their government like nasa( but they still collaborate and share resources) the rockets designed by space x have been tested and used by nasa and vice versa. \n\nHe didnt need to invent electric cars to take credit for popularizing and making them RELATIVELY more reasonable and convenient. Until tesla was a big car brand all other EVs were shit because no other car company saw a need to actually focus on them when everyone didnt mind using gas vehicles. After tesla started making Evs with features that were cool and convenient like 300 mile range, fast charging and high tech is when everyone started actually taking them seriously and its when other companies saw a market for them. Self driving technology has always been in development and hes never advertised it as being completely ready, but most other car companies already have some sort of self driving feature shipping with their newer models (because tesla already showed them thats a desirable future). \n\nElon musk is actually the head engineer at space x and its been well documented on multiple occasions, there is no debate about that all it takes is a quick google search. \n\nThis whole comment section strikes me as being dick ridey or blind mob like. Elon musk isnt god and hes not brain dead either, hes a guy who trolls the entirety of the internet for fun and happens to be decently smart. People ignore the fact that outside of the internet and media he has contributed to many things and has made multiple successful business endeavors, but he didnt do it by himself.",

I know at least a dozen people who work or have worked at Tesla in California. They all say he is very much knowledgeable and involved in the engineering process at the company.\n\nYou can even look at his background. He held multiple engineering internships:\n\n> In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at the energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at the Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games.\n\nI know one of the guys in this below compilation of testimonials. He's adamant in real life, just like virtually everyone who has worked with Elon, that he is a brilliant engineer who knows what he's talking about. \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceXLounge/comments/k1e0ta/evidence_that_musk_is_the_chief_engineer_of_spacex/",

Elon didn't become an engineer in the traditional way by working his way up through the ranks like most engineers do. He was able to utilize his wealth to start at the top. Not to say he isn't smart or incapable, but it's not how it is traditionally done. \n\nThink about the CEO who worked there way up through the company ranks, versus one who got the position because their family owned the company, sent their kid to business school, and then gave them the job after graduating. \n\nIn most cases the first example is probably going to be better at the job than the second. This isn't an absolute, there are always exceptions but you can see how people may apply the aforementioned scenario to Elon and come away thinking that his success is more related to access to opportunities others don't have versus experience and skill.",

In the article, the only reference to Musk is that Keller convinced Musk that Tesla could design its own chips and that Musk then assigned that task to him:\n\n> Keller was able to convince Musk that Tesla should design its own chip, and in return, Musk reportedly persuaded Keller that he was the right man to spearhead this ambitious task.\n\nKeller clearly is an engineer, but nowhere does he say that Musk is, or much less claim that he was humbled by Musk.",

      "text": ">I helped Elon start the company and all of these answers are spot on. He still has my book on rocket propulsion.....\n\n>What I found from working with Elon is that he starts by defining a goal and he puts a lot of effort into understanding what that goal is and why it is a good and valid goal. His goal, as I see it, has not changed from the day he first called me in August of 2001. I still hear it in his speeches. His goal was to make mankind a multi planetary species and to do that he had to first solve the transportation problem.\n\n>Once he has a goal, his next step is to learn as much about the topic at hand as possible from as many sources as possible. He is by far the single smartest person that I have ever worked with ... period. I can't estimate his IQ but he is very very intelligent. And not the typical egg head kind of smart. He has a real applied mind. He literally sucks the knowledge and experience out of people that he is around. He borrowed all of my college texts on rocket propulsion when we first started working together in 2001. We also hired as many of my colleagues in the rocket and spacecraft business that were willing to consult with him. It was like a gigantic spaceapalooza. At that point we were not talking about building a rocket ourselves, only launching a privately funded mission to Mars. I found out later that he was talking to a bunch of other people about rocket designs and collaborating on some spreadsheet level systems designs for launchers. Once our dealings with the Russians fell apart, he decided to build his own rocket and this was the genesis of SpaceX.\n\n>So I am going to suggest that he is successful not because his visions are grand, not because he is extraordinarily smart and not because he works incredibly hard. All of those things are true. The one major important distinction that sets him apart is his inability to consider failure. It simply is not even in his thought process. He cannot conceive of failure and that is truly remarkable. It doesn't matter if its going up against the banking system (Paypal), going up against the entire aerospace industry (SpaceX) or going up against the US auto industry (Tesla). He can't imagine NOT succeeding and that is a very critical trait that leads him ultimately to success. He and I had very similar upbringings, very similar interests and very similar early histories. He was a bit of a loner and so was I. He decided to start a software company at age 13. I decided to design and build my own stereo amplifier system at age 13. Both of us succeeded at it. We both had engineers for fathers and were extremely driven kids. What separated us, I believe, was his lack of even being able to conceive failure. I know this because this is where we parted ways at SpaceX. We got to a point where I could not see it succeeding and walked away. He didn't and succeeded. I have 25 years experience building space hardware and he had none at the time. So much for experience.\n\n> I recently wrote an op-ed piece for Space News where I also suggest that his ruthlessly efficient way to deploy capital is another great reason for his success. He can almost smell the right way through a problem and he drives his staff and his organization hard to achieve it. The results speak for themselves. The article is here [End of WWII Model Shakes Up Aerospace Industry.](https://spacenews.com/37245end-of-wwii-model-shakes-up-aerospace-industry/)\n\n>In the end I think that we are seeing a very fundamental shift in the way our world takes on the big challenges facing humanity and Elon's Way as I call it will be considered the tip of the spear. My hat's off to the man.\n\n~~ [Jim Cantrell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Cantrell)\n\nedit: Hey guys can we make this the most downvoted comment here in r/confidentlyincorrect that would be hilarious.",
