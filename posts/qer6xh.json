(Someone explained this to me by saying it\u2019s like a sea slug taking over a shell so it can do business as the shell organism quickly and without oversight.)\n\nIn this case, the announcement that the new Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) would merge with a SPAC called Digital World Acquisition Corporation (DWAC) sent DWAC\u2019s stock soaring by as much as 160%. It was the most traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with more than 260 million shares traded by midday.\n\nThe company never has to produce anything. Investors can make money just based on how people think the company might perform\u2014or not\u2014in the future.\n\nThe man behind this scheme is the person to whom McCarthy is demanding the Republican Party demonstrate absolute loyalty.\u201d",
