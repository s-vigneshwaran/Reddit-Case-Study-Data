According to religion you can pray away cancer, pray away poverty hell if you are truly evil you think you can pray away being LGBTQ+.  But you can't pray that fucking arm back kiddo.\n\nGod gives you the strength to go on without that arm!  FAIR point, which is proof God hates amputees the most.  All they can get on their best day is some strength to get through?  Not one will ever get that limb back though.\n\nTalk about being on the bottom rung, im not worshipping something who thinks a kid who lost their arm is less worthwhile then anyone else on the planet.  You can ask for forgiveness and repent for raping children or being a serial killer and get into \"heaven\" according to their rules, but that lost limb? nah dude fuck your limb.\n\n\"Fuck those kids and their missing limbs\" \n-God",

If you're unfamiliar with the concept I'll put it down below. If you are familiar with the concept (don't read the explanation), then you'll know it is entirely plausible to be infinite while not containing everything. \n\nThe idea goes like this: Think about all positive integers. There is an infinite amount. Now think of all integers (positive and negative). There is also an infinite amount. But the second set of numbers includes the first set, so the first infinite is smaller and does not contain everything possible. In this way, it could be possible for a god to be infinite while not being able to do everything (maybe represented by the positive integers and not being able to be negative to stick with the theme).",

Your argument here is the same one as saying that light wouldn't exist without dark and my point still stands for the same reason. Just replace light and dark with positive and negative. Wanting god to exist within made up parameters because it's more interesting is just as irresponsible as claiming god is 100% good, powerful and knowledgeable. You are just positing that a god exists but isn't all powerful. Sure, it's slightly more plausible but there is still zero reason to believe the claim. An inability to completely disprove something is not evidence for it's existence. That's why theist's claims are anti science and anti intellectual.\n\nWe also know that claiming such a being exists, without evidence, is irresponsible and dangerous. Throughout human history claims of God's existence have always been used as a means of control and an excuse to harm and manipulate the lower class. This is still religion's only real function. It doesn't matter whether the god is all powerful like the Christian one or less so like the Greek ones. \n\nHumanity needs to evolve and be honest about reality or we won't survive. Opening the door with long winded explanations that still boil down to, you can't disprove it so it could be true, are unhelpful and perpetuate a dangerous lie no matter how much more interesting it might be.",

You\u2019re all \u201cChristians\u201d and are really not going to part with $50 for a former student (whose family also all attended out school)\n\nI went and did it myself. \n\nThe biggest Christian cunt cakes I worked with was a Catholic. \n\nShe saw one of her students had a large lunch debt. (We would print off who owed what daily and send it home with the kids) CCC saw the student owed $60 and she thought of paying it, but the parents smoke. \n\n\u201cWhen are we going to punish kids for not paying their lunch bill\u201d Wha??? They\u2019re kids! This is the same woman who bragged about spending $10k in new furniture when she has toddlers at home. \n\nThe worst she did was when we had issue with the 3rd grade saying the \u201cr\u201d word. \n\nI am the resource teacher. CCC had all the 3rd grade together and asked who sees Mrs Amacray. She put the list on the board and then said, \u201cwhen you say the \u201cr\u201d word, this is who you are calling the \u201cr\u201d word.",

If a kid is out the school is required to tell the parents. In Florida they had a clause where if they believed it would put the kid in danger, they shouldn't.... Then they got rid of that clause. Now it doesn't matter. That kid could go home and either be kicked out or beat up. Doesn't matter to them. In Texas if the state finds our your kid is trans, *they will get the CPA involved* because it is now considered child abuse. Let's also not forget the the cases of teachers *going into stalls with trans students to see their fucking genitalia to see if they are actually trans or not.* Or we could even just ignore the fact that the Republican party has openly stated they will continue to fight same sex marriage. \n\nAnd of course all of this is coming off the the back of decades of just you're hatred for anyone LGBT. People were arrested simply for existing. People have been beaten and killed. It was the number one reason for children being kicked out of their homes. \n\nThey got a little quieter for a bit, but now they see that they are losing the battle and are just going all in on it again. This go's way beyond the bathrooms. Bathrooms have once again become something I wish we were talking about.",

Taking down the signs by \u201catheist pirates\u201d is only going to create a persecution complex at the church which will lead to more signs and more litter.  Keep in mind putting up signs is not so much about recruiting new members as it is a tool to brainwash or occupy existing members.  \n\nA more useful project may involve getting these people to make digital posts that do not create litter..  Maybe someone should create an atheist conversion circle jerk forum where religious people can post memes and testimony and bots can reply to the posts in ways that keep the people engaged.  I know I may have just explained certain corners of Facebook or Reddit, but perhaps the bots could be benevolently engineered so the religious people are less angry and more chill.  Like having a bot post something like, \u201cLoving Jesus makes you an awesome stud.  Now don\u2019t beat up gay people.\u201d",

For the Los Angeles homeless problem there are many factors some which you can control and some you can't. Weather and climate definitely is a factor to where the homeless want to be because if you're living outside you would rather be in Los Angeles than Madison, Wisconsin. Other factors that you can control is incentives and programs. You are rewarded for doing the bare minimum to keep your government benefits such as spending a couple of hours a week looking for work or going to 1 hour a month workshops on how to interview and create a resume. You can do this for 6-8 months for unemployment and almost indefinitely for food stamps. What I would do is start incentivizing people to find work by giving bonuses from people leaving unemployment, food stamps, welfare, and other tax payer subsidized programs. If you tell someone \"when you find that minimum wage job you lose all the help we give you,\" that just makes people not want to fill those jobs. Now after that I would start taxing companies that don't give a living wage to their employees to subsidize the government paying out these benefits. What this would do is increase employee wages because either you pay them more, or get taxed the same amount to not. Any and all working people that need to be on government programs that work at least a 35 hour work week, which I think should be considered full time, should get a UBI stipend if what is considered a living wage. Every employee working a full work week but can't make the basic needs to live, that employer should be taxed for it until they make it a living wage. If you don't want to work, and you lose your incentives to be homeless and you continue to beg, harass, and attack people you will be arrested for that crime. If you're mentally ill, put them in a treatment center to see if they get better. If they continue to act out then jail them instead of minor drug offenders and the remnants of drug users unfairly jailed under the three strikes law. Remove minimum jail sentences for the homeless incarcerated and release them after a panel of medical professionals believe they are rehabilitated and able to function back in society. Give those people that work the program all the opportunities with free housing, food, transportation, and other needs until they have a job that pays for their needs and slowly reduce the amount of benefits they receive so as to not give them an unfair burden. I can go on but I think that sums up my postion pretty well where both Republicans and Democrats in the middle could get on board with it.",

I doubt any Republican is going to get on board with that idea. Taxing employers is never on their platform. \nWe funded a mental health team here in L.A. and bought first responder vans for them 14 months ago. They just started rolling those vans yesterday because of all the red tape getting the program going. I didn't put an /s after I told you to run for mayor. I voted for Bernie, come be our Bernie.",

I don't need a whole lot of Republicans on board with my initiatives because I have a mostly liberal majority who I can easily sway to my side. Now these taxes are only to companies that don't provide what would be decided on an inflation based cost of living basis that would be reviewed annually. Now of course these companies are gonna pump money into my opposition with donations, bribes , and lobbying so I'm gonna have to fight against that front. What I need to do is gather a base of lower income people that not only want to work, but will encourage others to work based on my programs, which will be my grassroots campaign.  I don't need big donors or money to run a successful campaign anymore. AOC and others proved that a viral campaign with a few people manning social media and knowing the algorithms can get you way more money in the long run.",

My two best friends are in a committed marriage of 30 years and they love each other very much.Bill and Rick had a beautiful wedding and i was there with my husband.  They are welcomed at out church and yet they don't make a ig deal of it, If we could make a big deal of it they should be able to also, That is just how I feel, We are all people first, skin and bones, nest is our color and that is purely genetic. It means squat. Still people. I think next is our sexuality because itis such a big part of us all, Still people, but now is where God says the man not laying with man or woman with woman. And this is where I am so glad  He gave us a double edged sword in the free will thingy.  My feeling is that when God had a child who helped him feel alll the feelings that we experience as humans, ....well, I personally feel that all churches should have a huge heart and no thou shalt not.../ It's what I said to you this morning. It is so easy to love most all people and tyy for giving me another chance.  I hope we can be if not friends at least compadres.  TC and wish you all the best.",

Do you really think you can throw out your theory about something you don't even believe in the first place and what...I would say yes sir yes  you are sure right,  I use the word FAITH because that is what our belief comes from.  We believe that the bible was written by many people who were chosen by God to record the works and acts of people of FAITH all the way back to Moses and Abraham and David etc. Those men had their part of the Bible breathed into them by God Himself. They were worthy to receive it and by our faith and the teachings of The Bible so we have our foundation,  Now I am listening . You have my attention What do you believe in?  What or who is your \"higher Power\".",
