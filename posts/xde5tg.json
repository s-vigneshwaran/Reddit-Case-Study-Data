If the Republicans had 53 votes on their lunch order, they would eliminate the filibuster.  He's just saying that now because he doesn't want the Democrats to eliminate the filibuster and take advantage of their slim majority.",

Traitortrump left economy in shambles with 7% unemployment, negative GDP, 4000 Americans dying daily, hospitals out of supplies and overwhelmed and people in 6 hour lines at foodbanks. He is partly responsible for things right now. Recovery from pandemic is partly responsible for things right now and the whole world has the same problems. Maga fascism and dictatorship red state governors are responsible for things right now. The Biden administration has done everything possible to fix the mess and are doing a good job. Unemployment has been at lowest ever, GDP is moving up, gas prices are falling, infrastructure is happening. It is sad that people are living under oppression in red states but they need to vote out Republicans for their freedom",

Any mistakes or misunderstandings, you can blame the US public school system.\n\nSo in the US, the Legislature passes laws.  The President signs them, and the Supreme Court rules on constitutionality, and that's how we make sure no one branch of government fucks everything up.  Unfortunately, it only works sometimes.\n\nWithin the Legislature, there are two chambers, the Senate and the House of Representatives.  Both chambers have to pass the same (or similar) legislation for it to go to the President for signature (or veto, but we're not getting into that).  \n\nTo pass the legislation, there needs to be a vote of a simple majority.  In the House of Representatives, there are 435 congress people from across the country.  Each state is allocated a number of reps based on population, and then the states decide how to elect them.  To pass legislation, a bill must receive 218 votes.  Nancy Pelosi is the current Speaker of the House, meaning she was elected by the members of the House to be their leader and make sure everyone gets their turn at the podium.  She's third in line to be President, after the VP.  \n\nIf a bill passes the House, it goes to the Senate (and there are more complicated possibilities where legislation starts in the Senate, but that's less common).  There are 100 Senators, two from each of the 50 states, regardless of population.  This means states like Wyoming and North Dakota won't be ignored by more populous states like California, Texas, New York, and Florida.  We all ignore Wyoming and North Dakota, anyway.\n\nTo pass the Senate, a bill must receive 51 votes.  In the event of a tie, the deciding vote is cast by the VP (also bears the title of President of the Senate, because fuck it why not?).  The Senate also selects a leader to rule over them when the VP isn't in the room, called the President pro tempore, from the Latin word for \"nobody gives a shit about the President pro tempore.\" Each party also selects a leader for their party, called the Senate Majority Leader and the Senate Minority Leader.  The Senate Majority Leader is currently Chuck Schumer, Democrat from New York, while the Minority Leader is Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky and human/turtle hybrid.\n\nSo, everybody clear on the rules?  Every state elects their House Reps, and two Senators, bills need 218 in the House and 51 in the Senate, and then the President can sign it if they want.  \n\nGood, because it's never that simple.  In the House, 435 people is too many to get everyone's input on a bill, especially a complex bill, so they have committees where committee members from both parties review and modify the bills written by their corporate sponsors.  The committee's job is to come up with a palatable compromise that can go to the House floor for minimal debate and a vote. There is a limit to the duration of debate in the House, so if a bill gets out of committee, the Speaker can schedule a vote whenever there is a quorum, which is Latin for \"enough motherfuckers in the room.\"\n\nSo the real power in the House lies with committee members, as they get to shape the legislation as it's being passed along onto the floor, like a sphincter in so many ways.  \n\nIn the Senate, they also have committees, and they also have a lot of power, but there is a significant difference in that the Senate has no limit on the duration of debate.  So while a committee could propose a bill, once it gets to the floor, one of the Senators could stand up and talk about it.  As long as they keep standing and keep talking, nobody can stop them.  If a Senator keeps talking long enough, they can run out the clock on the Senate session and prevent the vote from happening that day.  They called it the filibuster, named for Philip Buster, a totally real guy that exists as long as you don't look him up.  \n\nThat was the rule until the 70s when they realized that there was always one grandstanding asshole who wanted to be famous for a minute.  \n\nSo the Senate made a new rule that they could end debate if 60 Senators agreed.  It's called a cloture vote, which is French for \"shut the fuck up already.\"\n\nAnd things went like that for a while.  If somebody wanted to filibuster, they could do so as long as 41 other Senators agreed, and they could stand and talk for a few hours.  There are records for the longest filibuster if you care about that sort of thing.\n\nBut then one day, a Senator had an idea, which is always a bad way to start a day.  They said to their colleagues, \"Listen.  I could totally stand here and talk for a few hours, and you don't have the votes to stop me, yeah?  So how about, instead of doing that, we don't but act like we did?\" And a majority of Senators agreed that was a good idea, which is always a bad way to end a day.  \n\nAfter all, it's not like one party would simply obstruct everything to demonstrate that government is bad and should be smaller.  That would be a egregious and obvious act of pettiness and spite, and nobody in their right mind would ever vote for people who do that.\n\nSo now the rule is, before legislation can be voted on in the Senate, any Senator can just say \"filibuster!\" and it must first pass a cloture vote.  Effectively, a bill needs 60 votes to agree to vote  to pass the bill with at least 51 votes.  \n\nNow the Senate has come up with a few ways to bypass a cloture vote for specific bills or types of legislation.  If they want to pass a bill to make sure they all get paid, for instance, that requires a simple majority.  They can also use a process called reconciliation, but that requires cooperation of the House, so they reserve that tactic for the expensive bills where they can hide all the ~~bribes~~earmarks.\n\nNow, Mitch McConnell, the testidunate Senator from Kentucky, a state known for fried chicken and racism, has often said that he wouldn't do things before he does them.  When Obama nominated a Supreme Court Justice, McConnell said that it wouldn't be fair to vote on a Justice in the last year of a presidency.   Four years later, he voted for Amy Barrett in the last year of Trump's presidency.  McConnell also changed the rule on SCOTUS nominees to prevent a filibuster after the Democrats filibustered Neil Gorsuch's nomination in 2017.  \n\nIt's worth mentioning that, due to the disparity in state populations, Republicans have 50 Senators yet represent less than 44% of American citizens, and an even smaller percentage of voters.  \n\nSo the question is, why should such a small group of shitheads make decisions for the majority?  So far, the Democrats have been reluctant to even discuss ending the filibuster, because they say that when they are in the minority again, Republicans will abuse the fuck out of their simple majority.  Mitch is saying that he would never do something so heinous as ending the filibuster just to pass anti-women legislation.  Which is a lie, he absolutely will.  There's no reason at all for Democrats to not end the filibuster now and take advantage of their majority, because who knows what will happen in the next election?",

That could be bad for those who pull his strings, because the Democrats might actually get some shit done without the Republicans there to obstruct them.\n\nPlus, if they nuke abortion, they'll have to come up with some new cause to whip their religious right zombie army into a frenzy.

In fact the turnout for the primary was bigger than the 2014 general elections and just slightly smaller than the 2018 generals.  \n\nNow let's wait til 2024, when Democrats run state amendments ensuring abortion access in every state with a referendum process.",

Then it was the Republicans making abortion illegal and now they want to shut down the LGBTG community? Isn't this what happened to Russia but down a different path, out the same end? Other countries like China, the Latin American countries they interfered with and some African countries like Sudan and S. Sudan? Infighting starting, potential second civil war only this time, over gay rights and abortion rights? I'm seeing some of what's happening, and the USA doesn't look that stable anymore. I believe the last straw will be the people being sick of it all, not liking the Republicans or Democrats and trying to make a new party or some shit. They might get a taste of their own medicine and a military coup will install a dictatorship. Or a civil war between the Republicans and Democrats over the right to feel safe.

So the past of the Republican party isn't a defense of it but rather a sad story of how far a party can fall in the chase of political advantages. \n\n\nNow I can tell history isn't your strong suit, but google \"southern strategy.\" Yes, Democrats were the party of choice for racist until around 1960's when blacks became an important and powerful demographic for Democratic areas, specifically big cities like New York. Meanwhile Republican did quite the opposite. I don't give any brownie points to Democrats, they just went with the flow of voters. But I do give Republicans a frowny face sticker for purposefully courting racists. See the link below:\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy\n\n\nIf you are actually willing to educate yourself and read the link above you'll see a dramatic change in Republican party doctrine and why the south suddenly voted Republican like their lives depended on it. And the Republican party defended for too long all the horrible and racist bullshit that went on there for decades - see Jim Crow. Republican chased the white southern vote and embraced all the lovely racism that came with that.\n\n\nFIN",

The argument is that we should \"leave the decisions up to the people.\" This means that laws can only be passed by states if they GRANT specific individual rights. If any state seeks to take an individual right away, like abortion, that is by definition, not \"leaving decisions up to the people.\" If the opinion of the whole country isn't valid for individuals, then why are the opinions of a whole state valid for individuals? By the same logic, I could disqualify the opinions of any voting group larger than one. It's cherry picking to hide authoritarianism.  The federal government has the responsibility to grant any individual right which any state seeks to take away. In effect, the federal government can only be as libertarian as the most radical state is authoritarian. I would claim the opposite too... State governments have the responsibility to grant any individual right that the federal government seeks to take away. \n\nTLDR: \"States rights\" is a misnomer for \"individual rights.\" Most individual rights do not need to be granted, they are assumed from the Bill of Rights. They only need to be granted when some authoritarian cunt tries to take them away, state or federal. Leaving a decision on individual rights up to the people as it turns out... requires no fucking law at all. It is the default.",

No one can legally force you to donate organs. Not even if you're the only viable match. Not even if you're dead. Forcing a pregnant woman to do so violates body autonomy. \n\nMedically the word \"abortion\" refers to any pregnancy loss due to premature uterine emptying. This includes miscarriages of very wanted pregnancies. These occasionally require medical abortions or the woman dies of septic shock.\n\nExceptions for the mother's life don't work because by the time her life is demonstrably at risk it's often too late. Women like [Savita Halappanavar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar) die.\n\nWomen have been denied [chemo and other meds](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/methotrexate-abortion-bans-chronic-conditions/) because they might get pregnant.\n\nWomen have been [legally investigated for natural miscarriages](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59214544.amp) under suspicion of abortion  \n\n[92% of all abortions occur in the first trimester](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/report/key-facts-on-abortion-in-the-united-states/#At-what-point-in-pregnancy-do-abortions-occur). Abortions past 20 weeks are only performed if the mother's life is at risk, or the fetus has a severe medical condition. These can't be diagnosed any earlier. (Edit to make it clear *if this law was in good faith it would not really stop any abortions.* it's true purpose is to move goalposts.)\n\n**The only reason to support a legal abortion ban is because you have religious beliefs that a woman's purpose is to serve as an incubator** and you're in the wrong sub. And if you don't fight for us, the Christofascists will come for your rights next.\n\n*If you're not American* this still affects you. Educate, vote, or cultists could take over your country too.",

Those fetuses were not viable and those women experience delayed care and worse results as a direct impact. Remember that Texas had one of the first bans back in September, which is why this study was able to be published so soon, so I think it'll be a few more months before we start really seeing the confirmed impacts of these bans nationally.",

I just want them to have a safety net so they can quit their horrible job and look for a better one without worrying that their life will completely collapse around them. I also don't want people to have to have 3 jobs just to make ends meet.\n\nI don't even care very much if the safety net ends up allowing people to get away with only having to earn a couple hundred dollars a month for themselves because they're otherwise content living in their single-room flat and playing video games all day. I don't think people like that would be a big enough drain on society for it to matter in the bigger scheme of things.\n\nI do also think that there should be some form of stipend for daycare, at least. I figure that since our society needs kids for society to continue, there should be some form of compensation for the people willing to raise those kids, both parents and daycare providers.

They will more likely accept that view, followed by \"I hate the Democrats too but from the left and won't vote for them,\" over \"I support Democrats and vote for them.\" \n\nMany people seem to think the president has near dictatorial powers and can force through major changes via executive orders. What can be done with executive orders is limited though and they can be undone by a Republican president.\n\nLikewise, many people don't understand the difference between the house and senate and that the senate holds a lot more power. It also has a bunch of little rules that make it difficult to make big changes with a simple majority. The more seats Democrats hold the greater the chances are more and better bills can pass. \n\nAnd people don't think about how the voting public varies across the US so it's not realistic to elect a ton of AOCs. In many areas, it's either a centrist or borderline Republican Democrat like Manchin or an actual Republican and the latter is still much worse.\n\nThen there are people who think changing the whole government system is easy and focus on that as a solution to our problems over voting. Making fundamental changes to our government is not easy at all, most require 2/3 of the government. So first we need a lot more Democrats (and left 3rd parties and Independents) in power. There is also not a realistic path to revolution and one we can feel safe won't be won by the far right who will obviously make things a lot worse if they have full power.",

What really happened is that politicians, led by Jerry Falwell, Sr., decided to make abortion into the single issue for a huge bloc of Americans. Falwell started the Moral Majority, and went about convincing evangelical christians to believe that abortion was wrong. Before that point, they were usually pro-choice, seeing \"pro-life\" as a catholic belief.\n\nNow, of course, all these politicians are just exploiting this insane voting bloc. On the other hand, the voting bloc is made of a bunch of people who used to be pro-choice when they were young, and now, forcing women to give birth is the only issue they care about. What I'm saying is that Falwell raised a generation of people who just accept that they cannot think for themselves. That's why it was so easy for grifters like Trump and Q to take control.",

This though isnt the main anti choice movement but when it comes to that arguement in particular it can be why.

Texas\nretains the right to secede from the United States, and the Texas Legislature should be called upon to\npass a referendum consistent thereto](https://texasgop.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/6-Permanent-Platform-Committee-FINAL-REPORT-6-16-2022.pdf)\n\nSo for first time since 1860 a majority of a State Legislature has *endorsed* secession (in its platform).",

My wife and I were on a wait list for infertility treatment.  We were at about a 6 month wait,  because the states around us are very red,  our wait time went to 18 months because of the sudden influx of out of state people.  It's not about saving kids lives,  because then they wouldn't be against infertility.  This also has many negative effects for the LGBT+ community, making some surgeries nearly impossible,  as well as making the old laws against any sex other than vaginal intercourse much easier to bring back.

                  "text": "> By a third party I mean one that acts in the interest of the common person.\n\nAnd like I said, this is pie-in-the-sky stuff because we don't have the luxury of even trying for a third party when the biggest threat is allowing the party that will loyally vote for ANYONE willing to strip people of their rights to win. The people currently voting Democrat are way more likely to split their votes between Democrats & whatever third-party option materializes. \n\nAnd what would happen if they did? Well, the GOP would receive the majority votes meaning the Democrats and the third-party would become the minority, even if they represented the majority of people. THAT is the flaw in the third-party system logic without first setting up new election laws. \n\nAnd what do I mean by that? Look at the ranked voting system a few states have chosen to use. That could actually benefit a third party because people would then have the ability to rank their choices based on not just the best candidate but also their second choice which could result in Democrats and a third-party taking majority power, then forming a progressive coalition that essentially holds majority power. \n\nBut first, you must change the laws in each state. That's not going to be easy and it will take time. A lot of time, probably decades.\n\n> It\u2019s all fear based\n\nGood. You should be afraid. The GOP is proudly coming for your individual rights to control your own body. That includes healthcare beyond abortion.\n\n> Why not a third that had neither?\n\nAnd we're back to a pie-in-the-sky. Why do you believe that a third-party would just... be better than what we have? Why? Because it would be new? We've seen Europe go through various waves of parties that came from nothing to gain control and... quickly turn into the exact same propagandized self-absorbed machine of disinformation & empty promises. \n\nMaybe the answer is to choose the best worst option. Because doing nothing results in the worst worst option. But the more ignorant people are about how politics actually work, how their government actually works, the more likely they are to order a pie-in-the-sky to fulfill their delusional fantasy about a better world. \n\nHistory should tell you there is no better world. There is the shit world you keep or the shit world they give you when you do nothing to stop them. And believing otherwise will get you more and more of what we are getting now with the Supreme Court.\n\nMuch like Trumpers hate accepting the fact he lost, lefties hate the reality that there is no progressive solution just RIGHT THERE for the taking.",

The problem with the US is it's MASSIVE, not just in landmass and population, but in the complexity of governments. Each state is like a country, so 50 countries with their own laws that have to also conform to federal laws. However, even when something is a federal law, each of these states can constantly TRY to make laws that violate that federal law, then contest the law in court until it ends up in the Supreme Court & gets tossed out or affirmed.\n\nNow, that's not very different from a lot of European countries. What IS different is how focused Americans are on the federal government, while almost ignoring the most important parts of their election process, local & state elections. This is what makes changing something in the US so difficult, because the masses of voters have NO IDEA how to make the government work best for them. \n\nAmericans have consistently focused their voting energy on the 4-year cycle surrounding presidential elections instead of the 2-year cycle of the majority of elections. And this is why it will be so difficult to get the changes the country needs, because the people who want change the most, have no fuckin' clue how to get it & will make no fuckin' effort to know how to get it, instead just complaining & coming up with \"obvious\" ideas for how to do it without knowing how to get it done.",

It wasn't even on their radar. \n\nPeople will argue, but abortion is black and white. The only humans with rights that are involved are the women seeking abortion. Since no one is being forced to abort, it's a denial of human rights to prevent women from obtaining one. If democrats cared about human rights, this issue and plenty others would be written and agreed upon by the party, awaiting the moment they had the ability to pass it. But it wasn't because they didn't, and they still don't. Society and human rights will never trump investor relations or profit. That's the real reason, the only reason that matters.",

Republicans only allow for exceptions if the mother's life is at immediate risk.\n\nHave you missed the multiple instances of women not getting access to an abortion because of that restriction? That they were forced into a higher risk of complications because they had to wait for a deterioration of their pregnancy (even if the outcome will be the same) before they're allowed an abortion? **This bill absolutely does not put it in line with European ones and it's disingenuous to suggest otherwise.**\n\nMore to the point, many women get abortions after 15 weeks if their spouse passes away or if they become a victim of domestic abuse. These women are already in a vulnerable circumstance and you think forcing them to continue with their pregnancy and risk their mental health is reasonable?",

Why did Republicans not vote for it?\n\nUnlike the bogeymen used by Republicans, the idea that women use abortions as a contraceptive isn't even realistic given the costs and recovery involved. Genuinely, do you believe a woman carries a fetus for 15 weeks and then casually decides to abort it? The reality is that they simply don't, and it's why <2% of abortions are performed after 15 weeks and why the majority of those abortions are for these reasons:\n\n- The woman's physical and mental health are at risk.\n\n- The fetus is not viable.\n\n- The woman is a victim of domestic abuse.\n\n- The woman's spouse passes away.\n\nIn which of these scenarios would it be reasonable to force a woman to continue with their abortion? An abortion would be allowed for said woman in most EU countries, but these are exceptions that Republicans do not accept. This bill is completely out of touch with why women would get an abortion after 15 weeks and only seeks to punish the most vulnerable of women.

But that because women didn't have that power and control at the beginning of this nation - mainly because it was in the hands of their husbands - that they cannot argue that they get it today automatically.  Instead, they only can get those rights to her personal bodily authority today if their local government says that it is OK that they can get it.  \n\nThis is so much worse a conclusion than what I see written in the media.",

And even other Christians are not \u201creal Christians\u201d: Catholic, Orthodox, Episcopal (etc.) Christians are not seen as true Christians. \n\nSo this line of thinking is what gives them the audacity and the confidence to say,\n\n \u201cTo hell with the separation of church and state\u201d.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to make laws that follow the word of God, the Bible, as WE see fit\u201d\n\nBecause the genuinely see themselves as an extension of the arm of God and they see their power and domination over the other people of the world as the power of God through them over the world. \n\nSo we hear them say things that sound crazy, like;\n\u201cMillions dying from COVID was God\u2019s will.\u201d\nor during the AIDS crisis, when they said that AIDS was \u201cGod\u2019s punishment for being gay\u201d\nKnow that they truly mean it.\n\nAnd when we have seen over the decades that Christianity and white supremacy are inextricably linked. \n\nBut when you tell Evangelicals of colors, like Hispanics Evangelicals that the policies that Evangelicals want would negatively affect them as Hispanic people of color, they do not care in the slightest because they see it as the will of God acting through Christians. \n\nThe recent SCOTUS rulings are only the beginning. \nEvangelicals have been fighting for decades trying to overturn Roe vs Wade. \n\nAnd they are going to try and ban contraceptives, ban same sex marriages, ban gay sex, ban mixed marriages, and they will attempt to ban citizen voting. \n\nTheir Christian Nationalism will become more fervent. \n\nAnd if you notice that their methods become more and more fascist and authoritarian, just know that they do not care because they see themselves as the will of God incarnated on Earth.\n\nConsider this during the midterm election..",

I do have hope, however little, that a new generation of politicians will do better but idk, that seems naive. Also one last thing, introduce a bill to legalize marijuana country wide instead! Maybe then some of these dudes with such tight ass holes will loosen up!",

It's purely 100% for the chance to show that they aren't really against abortion, it's up to the states and people to decide!  Which reinforces the narrative they've been pushing since it was overturned. And it gives them the chance to deflect attention from what they're doing in your state.  And it's a dog whistle for all their zealots out there. It's a really cynical way to govern, but hey that's where we are at now.",

The truth is, he doesn\u2019t have those votes and I\u2019m not sure there is even a chance in hell that he could muster them.

You\u2019re talking about republicans trying to \u201cban abortion nationwide\u201d, and then you go on to elaborate on that by explaining that Graham introduced a bill the restricts abortion after 15 weeks.  Those ideas are not at all the same thing.  On a relative basis, there is very little national support for \u201cbanning abortion\u201d entirely.  Even among pro-life folks, a huge portion agree that there are circumstances where abortion should be legal.  So, as is typically the case, the silent majority rest toward the center on this issue, and the extremes are scrambling about trying to stoke the flames of fear. Chilllll",

Voting in democrats won't change the republican party.\n\nThere are 2 options if you want to get anywhere near progress in this country. \n\nThe first option is to push the corporatists out of the democratic party. That means voting in primary races. They have all the money though, so it's not easy.\n\nThe second is to vote third party. The 2 parties now set the rules such to make it as difficult as possible for a third party to get into a debate or onto a ballot. The dems you're telling people to vote for? They intentionally rig the game so you have no other option. They literally cheat. It is straight stockholm syndrome to vote for these people. They have you literally living in fear of voting third party. If people weren't so afraid of voting third party, those votes wouldn't be so meaningless. \n\nThat's you - you are those people - you're the reason those votes are so meaningless. A snake eating itself.\n\nNeither option is easy. Voting dem is easy - but nothing good ever comes from taking the easy way. The dems are so bad, so corrupt, so out of touch, so unlikable, that a literal ball of grease won the presidency in 2016 over them. And if you keep voting for them, they won't have to change. And that grease will fester, and then it'll return. \n\nThe best approach to tackling these problems is probably to pass referendums on ranked choice voting in every state. That's the starting point as I see it. That'll help with both primarying the shit dems, and will help serious third party movements gain traction. It'd probably improve the republican party too. Crazy idea, letting people vote for politicians they actually like, I know. I don't see change happening any other way, personally. \n\nThat's my view on it. There are other views, but this one's mine. It's the definition of insanity to repeat the same course of action over and over, and expect a different outcome. \n\nAnd anyone telling me I HAVE to vote for THEIR GUY or I'M EVIL can just fuck right off. Talk like that is straight ignorant.",

We would have to get rid of the electoral college for this to work, and a third party would have to start from the grassroots and take over every city council, every county commissioner, every local race before even thinking about going for state and national office.\n\nAnother reason why merely voting this party doesn't work is because the overwhelming majority of the population is locked into one party or another, and unless you have a sudden change of heart out of 100+ million Americans all at once - it will merely give those votes to whoever the most entrenched 2 party choice is.\n\nSo for third party to work, we need ranked choice voting in every election, we need third party candidates winning at the local level EVERYWHERE, and we need to eliminate the electoral college, which favors the 2 party system; and it can completely stop a legitimate election of a third party candidate because our system is just that fucked.",

Probably not so good and I take it you would object to those statements on numerous grounds. \n\nI understand you vigorously oppose the extremely wrong anti abortion legislation in question, but the atheist community is better than some of the comments I am seeing. \n\nWorth noting that atheism does not have a position on abortion. It\u2019s a single position on a single issue, lack of belief in god or gods. \n\nThe back and forth culture war othering on the political stage is causing more and more problems. I\u2019d argue that we wouldn\u2019t be in this position if people on the left and right abided by reasonable rules of engagement and displayed intellectual honesty and humility. That all stems from realising that many atheists were previously religious. And many people on the other side of the cultural divide may come over to our side if we have conversations with them as human beings. \n\nJust my opinion I guess.",

Often placing their chips within both parties to ensure their agendas go without challenge when the appropriate party is in office...\n\nI notice the ultra right christians are often with the republicans, which is logical, until you realize that to the farthest right, the christians are nothing but useful tools.. give them what they want, and they will vote for the shittiest people representing them... Once that extreme right gets full power, they will throw the christians to the curb once they are no longer useful.\n\nI notice the extreme left democrats seem to love communism... Everyone is equal, and their extremist donors are often following the same line of thought... However if they get their way, why would you need to throw anyone to the curb... They would have all the power, and you are nothing but an irritation that will disappear if you fall out of line.",
