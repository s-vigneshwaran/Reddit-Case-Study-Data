  "text": "10 YEAR OLD rape victim denied abortion in Ohio.\nExactly what most of us thought / feared would happen with the overturn of Roe is in fact already happening. The \"Christian\" right's obsession with sticking their noses into every woman (and in this case CHILD'S) healthcare decisions has now resulted in a victimized 10-year-old girl in Ohio being re-victimized yet again by having to travel to Indiana carrying her rapist's baby for the procedure. I already see \"Christians\" making their usual \"Well, it's not the BABY'S fault...\" comments all over social media and \"It's a state's right issue and she was still able to get one so shut up!\" knowing damn well they want this to be a federal ban. Disgusting! I truly detest these fuckers.  \n\n\n[https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2022/07/01/ohio-girl-10-among-patients-going-indiana-abortion/7788415001/](https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/2022/07/01/ohio-girl-10-among-patients-going-indiana-abortion/7788415001/)",

This pissed me off to no end, so last year I put together a sheet of paper that showed minimum wage, together with cost of studio apartment in various red states, cost of basic groceries, transportation costs (bus or car insurance), etc etc. I actually saw his face change reading it and getting to the bottom showing that essentially you have to work every day to survive and that there is no way you can afford to either take off work OR to travel out of state, much less do both. \n\nI\u2019m happy to say that he actually changed his view and while he still personally hates abortion, he is actually pissed at what SCOTUS did.",

It's really a question over whether the state is more urban or rural, as that will likely determine who controls the state.\n\nYet at the end of the day, folks from rural areas in \"blue states\" are going to have the freedoms I mentioned in my previous post, all while people in the \"liberal bubbles\" you described in your red state likely will not. \n\nWhat you do with that knowledge will be largely up to you, but I think the trends, as history has shown, is that pretty soon you may find that bubble of liberalization slowly going elsewhere.",

There are also multiple factors at play, beyond just the SCOTUS ruling on Roe v. Wade.\n\nThat said, the fact that historically brain drains are a real thing is difficult to argue against. Typically folks are happier to live in place that best align with their values. \n\nWould be interested to hear the trend for your area a year from now.",

We just need to replace the bad guy with legislative power with the good guy with legislative power. The problem with this line of thinking is that no politician, regardless of party affiliation, is beholden to the voters anymore. They all lie and swindle and backstab their way to the top. When they're sworn in, they will only listen to the special interest lobbyists with the heaviest money bags, and when they retire after 10-15 years, they (and their children, and grand-children) get to live in the lap of luxury.\n\nMy fellow Dems have put way too much faith into the system. The same system that the Republicans have been chipping away at since Reagan. The same system that Trump lunged his massive girth towards on Jan 6th, 2021.",

You'd only have to suffer through 4 years of Clinton.\n\nFurthermore, a third party vote is meaningless. I wish it wasn't, but it is. Have the dems learned their lesson from losing the election? Nope. In fact, a lot of people saw how bad Trump was and wanted to go with the safe Biden choice instead of risking losing with a more progressive candidate.\n\nIf there weren't 2-3 lifetime appointment justices up for nomination, I'd have no problem with voting 3rd party or not voting in protest.

Of course, the winter could be absolute garbage but in the summer and fall you could just go to the amusement and water parks every weekend. I've traveled all over the country going to different amusement parks and I honestly feel like Ohio has the best ones, second place would be the DC area (I guess the parks are technically in Maryland and Virginia but you fly into DC to get there so that's how I think of it.) But yeah I don't know if there's much to do in the winter in Ohio. Apparently you can technically snowboard there in the winter, though I'm doubtful it'll be anything like Mount Hood here in Oregon. Maybe I'll just end up at BWW all the time in the winter lol, I do love BWW.",

Not on the level of Portland, but there's not many better cities for inclusivity until the east coast. Inside the city you'll find plenty of kindred spirits. Unfortunately, the further out you go the worse it gets. Even the suburbs lining 270 have a pretty even split politically, and any further will be overwhelmingly conservative. We ARE know for the \"hell is real\" sign after all. Worse yet, gerrymandering means state-wide policies are largely conservative. The only positive I can tell you is that more than most other states, your vote really, really matters. Ohio isn't a lost cause like some states, even with recent trends.",

The bar got really quiet and we took that moment to pay our bill and fuck off back to the room.\n\nWe definitely bought an entire handle from them before going upstairs to get hammered. When we showed up to the work event the next day we were not the only people hungover, it's like the entire event was moving at 75% speed, as if real life had lag.\n\nInteresting and mildly terrifying experience.",

PEOPLE within those organizations grab power and do the exact opposite of what the texts say to do in many cases. So I don't even need to argue whether or not a god or gods exist. Because when you see what RELIGION is and has become it is a large machine used for control of people within a society in ways to increase said religions power and the individuals in it. So you are saying prove something is a lie that is actually provable as a lie. It is visible to see and touch. We don't have the wiggle room here that someone might try to claim over the argument of \"prove or disprove god doesn't exist\".  The long history of religious books being altered and charlatans being exposed is more well known than any time in history. We have the receipts. There are literally old bible copy that have scribes hundreds of years ago fighting over what the texts should say as they argued in the margins. Hell the founder of Mormonism had an old egyptian papyrus he declared told the story of the lost tribe coming to america and once the rosetta stone was found and we were able to read it it was just torn out of some commoners book of the dead that he had been buried with.. \"Religion is a lie\" is an actually easily proven statement.

Every religion that talks about commandments, tenants, sins or similar concepts is automatically false because morality is both taught and biological and can vary drastically between cultures, places and ethnicities, not to mention periods in history.\n\nIn one time slavery was moral. In some places its moral to eat people or commit suicide if dishonored. And this is an empirical fact.\n\nAnother example is that we live in a probabilistic or deterministic universe, not a stochastic one - which disproves concepts such as free will, gods plans, prayer and hell/heaven like constructs.\n\nThere are many other examples I can list.

I never said Jesus is a god, Jesus did any of his miracles, Jesus bla bla. All I said is that he did pop up in historical accounts, which is true. None of them mention he did any of the miracles, though.. \n\nand I don\u2019t rlly expect there to be archaeological evidence of a normal man from 2000 years ago\u2026 like I said, never claimed he was a god or he rlly was what Christianity has made him today.",

Where has this sense of self importance come from? Is it the trusty worthy priests and bishops? The religious violence? The speaking in tongues? Fucking LOL. You losers are insufferable man! Don't you have anything exciting going on? Or just b*ble class? What an astonishingly stupid way to spend your only time on this planet. Baring in mind, this is it. This is all you get, 80 years maybe, and you would like to spend your time \"fearing\" literally nothing. Just living in fear. I'm sorry you've been lied to and you can't escape the cycle, but don't drag others down with you in this utterly ridiculous life sabotaging pyramid scheme. Thanks.",

I\u2019m Lutheran and believe the Bible\u2019s main message is the 10 commandments - the most important being love thy neighbor. Taking it to heart, I fully believe and support LGBTQ+, abortions, etc and have been heartbroken at the last hurricane onslaught of human rights taken away. Especially since Christians and religion have been a main justification for SCOTUS - don\u2019t get me started on Judge Amy Coney Barrett\u2026\n\nSo although there *are* people who affiliate with Christianity and act this way, I\u2019d say they\u2019re not true Christians because of their actions. At least that\u2019s how I categorize them in my head. They aren\u2019t following the word of the Lord, heck they\u2019re not even following the Pope! They are out for their own agenda and likely greed, and it\u2019s sickening for us as a country, but also tainting any love and respect the religion once had. They likely don\u2019t have a church, but even some of the Southern churches terrify me with some of their messages lately, so who\u2019s to say?\n\nJust asking for open minds because not all Christians believe this is the right course of action. My entire congregation is proof of that. Let\u2019s save kids from guns, protect an individuals right to love who they want to love (God is love - so why the heck would anyone want to limit the love in the world?! This attack never made sense to me), and protect mothers and their bodies, and go all the way with universal healthcare and privacy rights like the EU data, and fix the electoral college! Again, surprising people use Christianity to limit mothers\u2019 and the female body, because I swear there\u2019s passages regarding a mother is sacred and should have all the care and protection in the world.\n\n~stepping down from my internet pedestal cause I never do this~",

More and more churches are preaching that we should kill gay people and adulteresses (yes, that was literally in a sermon at a church I attended a few years ago). Right now, they're afraid of arrest. If they gain enough power, they'll be murdering their kids, too. I grew up in an extremist family that nearly killed me through medical neglect. They pointed guns at me for disagreeing with them. I know what happens when extremists from any religion gain too much power, because I lived it. \n\nTake your Islamaphobia elsewhere. Muslims aren't the problem. Extremists are.

No casualty numbers given.\n\n\n10) Come Armageddon Jesus personally kills everyone on the planet except a fairly small number of folks who represent the tribes of Isreal - AFTER- torturing them for 1000 years.\n\n\n11) Jesus performed,  and the church continues to preform Canabalism, depending on denomination its \"for real\" or just symbolic.\n\nThis is just off the top of my head, not even getting to the inconsistencies, contradictions, and oppressive nature of the laws and rules.\n\nChristianity is s a death cult, the Bible is snuff porn",

I suspect there isn\u2019t any.

Likely there is no mention of the male party involved because children who are the victims of crime often have their identity protected. Since it's not stated, we don't know if it was a man or a 10 year old boy. Either way, the one party we know of is a child who legally cannot consent, and I'm more immediately concerned about her health and well-being than satisfying some punishment fetish. For fucks sake, not subjecting her to the physical and mental damage of carrying a pregnancy to term at this age is going to help her a lot more right now than putting the other party in jail.",

I haven't seen one comment even mentioning concern for what type of sentence this pervert will get, just post after post about which groups they hate and anger over abortions being less convenient for Ohioans.  Liberals are always quick to say how selfish and uncaring conservatives are and how inclusive, tolerant and nondiscriminatory they are, but this comment thread tells a different story.  Although liberals are said to support religious freedom these comments reflect a total hatred of Christianity, with some of them including suggestions of violence.  Their \"inclusivity\" doesn't extend to conservatives either.  It seems they only have tolerance for like minded thinkers and have no interest in even considering the chance that differing opinions may actually have merit or value to them.  Seeing the abundance of hate contained in these comments explains how liberals can be so cold and callus over the purposeful death of an unborn child.  They talk about ending a pregnancy, which essentially ends the life of a child, with no more care, compassion, or thought than they would over ending the life of a bug.  The same people who think nothing of aborting a human would physically attack someone if they thought they had mistreated an animal.  The more exposure I get to liberal ideology the less sense it makes to me.",

The taliban are not republicans. ISIS are not republicans. \n\nThe thing they all have in common is a desire for heavy authoritarianism based on radical religious conservatism, the more \"fundamental\" the better. They all believe in and espouse the exact same horse shit our own homegrown American religious conservatives believe and espouse. They all hate and want to punish the 'same' people, and that absolutely includes members of their own tribes who aren't conservative *enough*. The only real differences between them are the languages they speak and the names they call their gods and prophets. \n\n150 years ago these same American conservatives didn't even call themselves \"republicans\"- they were proud \"democrats\". The labels they use are transitory, but the thing that didn't change over that time was their conservative \"values\".",

Why would someone like that give heed to the troubles of poor people?

The people who make it are so steeped in religious fervor that everything is either reward or punishment (those that we dole out are just substitutes for god\u2019s judgement\u2026as in the prosperity gospel). So to them, an abortion is some kind of misplaced retribution against the rapist: a punishment *for* the rape. What they fail to see, though, is that an abortion isn\u2019t about punishing the father, it is about the mother\u2019s choice. A rape victim can choose to raise the child of their rapist, but they can also choose to not. She did not consent to sex and has no responsibility to carry the consequences (this is in response to the \u201cjust don\u2019t have risky sex\u201d argument\u2026I\u2019d argue that she is never obliged to carry the fetus).",

So even in cases where it is reported, where the police do take it seriously, where a conviction is able to be obtained (and we\u2019re far against the odds by now), it can be that a rapist gets parental rights.  \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2016/11/17/health/rape-parental-rights/index.html\n\nBut to be clear, even if it is possible to terminate parental rights, this is not something that happens automatically even if there is a conviction.  The woman has to fight in court to get the rights terminated, which can be time consuming, expensive, and traumatic.  This is the case in Ontario where I live, too.  Courts are required to consider any family violence, including sexual, in determining child custody, not limited to criminal offences.  But the automatic presumption under the law is that the parents of a child all have custody.  It takes a court order to change that, which, like I said, is costly, time consuming, and traumatizing.  \n\nAlso, idk about the US, but it is difficult these days to actually take away parental rights without consent.  The presumption is now that a child benefits from knowing and having both parents.  The default is shared custody of some form (and to be clear, when we aren\u2019t dealing with abuse of some form, that\u2019s generally a good thing).  Even in cases of horribly unfit parents, courts are reluctant to take away access entirely.   I actually know people who experienced or witnessed abuse in the home, they hated the parent that did these things, and the court didn\u2019t think that the perpetrator could be trusted with unsupervised access\u2026but they were still forced to have supervised visits at designated facilities until they were deemed old enough to refuse.  Tbh, I have no idea how this serves the supposed goal of promoting the welfare of the child, which is supposed to be paramount, since it just forces them to have contact with their abuser and surely that trauma would outweigh or prevent any normal benefits from having both parents.  Certainly, the people I know who went through this\u2026they hated every moment and immediately ceased contact the second they could.",

We haven't seen a lot of hiding, even less since 2016. Also, why can't they be both Christian and racist? Seems to go together like peanut butter and chocolate as far as anyone who has read a history book can tell. Take a look at the most racist organizations and movements in US history. They all have Christian roots.\n\nIf it really is against the religion, how exactly did your \"god\" do such a shitty job writing the \"holy\" books that supposedly makes such ideas anti-Christian that so many millions get it so wrong, constantly, and century-after-century? One would think the plain language of the \"words of god\" would cause anyone to realize that it's not the right thing to do or the right attitude to hold.

And that's unfortunate. I think we're in for dark times ahead entirely driven by your religion.\n\n* You will soon see LGBTQ people being rounded up for breaking sodomy laws that will, no doubt, once again be called constitutional. And some of those laws used to be life imprisonment, and a lifetime disenfranchisement. I think we'll only be lucky if it's not the death penalty in some states which they will be free to set if they wish, being a state issue. \n\n* You'll no doubt see the death penalty being a state law for abortion, and women being killed for it. Perhaps even being killed because they had an innocent miscarriage. \n\n* You're likely to see forced Christian prayer in spite of your support for other religions. I fully expect Engel V. Vitale being reevaluated and perhaps gutted.\n\nIt's a shock when someone who claims to be Christian is against any of these things, as you claim.

I salute you for adopting a position of love that gets you ostracized. It's worth standing up for. And it's difficult. It's even more difficult to keep believing in spite of the fact that everyone in your close circles are telling you that you have gotten it wrong. \n\nConsidering what you see other people believe Christianity is: why do you believe what you believe?",

As I\u2019ve grown older, 33F, I\u2019ve noticed I\u2019m different from my family . I am always trying to understand why someone may have done something or feel the way they do. Often times, if you listen instead of judge, it\u2019s amazing what you find out. My mother is very empathetic. She\u2019s helped people like I have. My aunt is Christian. While she didn\u2019t agree with Roe v Wade, she does believe that abortion has its place and wants access for several different reasons, just not for unwanted pregnancies. While I don\u2019t like the idea of abortion, I support it regardless under any circumstance, because I can think past the situation and see how extreme the consequences of not having it are. And my religion has no place in telling others what to do or judging them. \n\nI very much care for the welfare of others. While also simultaneously being greatly annoyed by most people lol. I don\u2019t know why. I\u2019m very introverted. I\u2019m usually the first person to offer help when I see someone needs it. No need to ask, I just kinda show up. \n\nI feel these actions are moral, even if you\u2019re not religious. I feel this also follows what Jesus would want me to do. While I don\u2019t typically struggle making a moral decision, I do at times refer to my faith to make a decision. Mostly, I do what\u2019s right and I am very intent on not causing others to be upset or affected negatively by my decisions. \n\nI continue my faith because it\u2019s my faith. There isn\u2019t one thing I can tell you why it\u2019s correct and I wouldn\u2019t consider trying to convert you, but this conversation did call to me. I don\u2019t mean divinely lol, I just feel it\u2019s my duty to also share my beliefs and stance, especially when others stating their faith has been so hurtful. We are not all the same. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for what\u2019s happening. I never envisioned people using their religion in the US to do so much harm to good people. I don\u2019t support the taliban, but I do support my Muslim brothers and sisters. I know they are loved by God as well. How could he not? No one controls where they are born on this Earth. But so many religions are amazingly close. I think there is some truth in all of them and we as people have decided what\u2019s right and what\u2019s not. The commandments were clear. And we should love the neighbor as we love ourselves. Maybe some people are just incapable of love",

There isn\u2019t one thing I can tell you why it\u2019s correct and I wouldn\u2019t consider trying to convert you, but this conversation did call to me. \n\nIt's possible that's because I usually ask open questions rather than make attacks. Plus, I'm genuinely curious about what people believe and why. Especially when it's in such opposition to the way most people with your religion act. You're rare, but you also seem to believe that you're not. Why do you think that?\n\n> We are not all the same.\n\nSo true, but there are too many that fall to their types. It's why I asked why you believe what you believe, since you don't seem to regurgitate the hate that most do. \n\n> I\u2019m sorry for what\u2019s happening. I never envisioned people using their religion in the US to do so much harm to good people. I don\u2019t support the taliban, but I do support my Muslim brothers and sisters.

Maybe some people are just incapable of love\n\nThis is where the Christian ideal of apologizing for someone else's actions falls short. To hold up a mirror to you, saying sorry on their behalf for them doesn't stop the person from learning anything, or even give them a reason to stop causing so much harm. They'll keep doing it. Nor have they even apologized, which is usually the second step, after you've accepted that you've done something wrong. And they've done none of these steps.\n\nTo be plain and honest, you also don't really represent the ones you're talking about in any meaningful way. Although the sentiment is welcome, actions are more meaningful. And the only words that would make a difference is if you spoke out against it like so many don't do.\n\nYou've again said that you think that your god sent a clear message. The question becomes: Why would an omnipotent, omniscent, omnibenevolent god do such a poor job conveying that simple message that people do the exact opposite and still sincerely believe god wants them to act the way that they do?",

Most the people we\u2019re  talking about are complete strangers to me. While my family has some different views, they are good people who have never been malicious. They\u2019ve adopted children, been fosters, never ostracized the gay family member, and they would never tell anyone they are going to hell. I believe my mother said what she said to me about voting blue simply because we were in a very heated time politically. They all love Trump, i beg you not to ask me why lol. I can barely tune into them when they go there. But they haven\u2019t shown me hate or wanted others to suffer in anyway. So, while they have said things based on faith that I don\u2019t agree with, like lgbtq+, trans, abortion, etc, you\u2019d never see them going online and challenging others and saying despicable things like some one Reddit. They still show love to others and I respect that, even if they personally don\u2019t agree with some of it. \n\nAnd that\u2019s how it should be. You don\u2019t have to agree with it, but you don\u2019t then to get to tell someone they are wrong. My fathers side may be a little different. My father and his wife were antimaskers, against the vaccines even tho he was being treated for cancer during that time, and have been in \u201cFacebook jail\u201d many times. They claim this infringing on their freedom of speech. I just shake my head. I\u2019ve tried conversing, but they are too stubborn.\n\nAs far as why God does something? I don\u2019t mean this rudely.

And when is the right time to do so?\n\nBased on the values you stated earlier, you seemed to be concerned about the bulleted list of items mentioned earlier. You seemed to be nonjudgemental about LGBTQ people, hold a belief in bodily autonomy, and accept freedom for others to practice non-Christian religions. But the upcoming laws that will attack all of these. The next election cycle will determine if we will be imposing this tyrannical Christian order on everyone else counter to your stated beliefs and who people vote for will determine this. Most of us will be trying to stop it, it's important enough to try to do something about it no matter what.\n\nThe question you should keep wondering about moderate Christians is: What do you think is the right thing to do, and when, based on your own faith in your god and what your god taught? Not the easy thing, but the right thing?\n\nFrom experience, for most, the answer to 'when' is never, and the answer to 'what' is is to stand aside and let it happen without doing or saying much, as we've discussed in this thread, and you seemed to agree with. You'll be watching these deadly, hateful laws passed by people who call themselves Christian in the next election cycle. And, if love is truly something that's a central value, and you have as much empathy as you appear to have, the news after will turn your stomach. All of these cheered and voted on by people you know. You probably know that they're not even aware of what they're about to unleash on their own family members, considering what you've said. Perhaps you can educate them. You should fear they'll be surprised and say that they didn't know that their politicians would do that after the fact. After, perhaps, your own family member is locked up due to a misbegotten sodomy law passed by a politician they voted for based on what most Christians we hear from would call an act deserving of death but the rest of us think is a private choice made by consenting adults.\n\n> As far as why God does something? I don\u2019t mean this rudely. How should I know? Being a Christian doesn\u2019t automatically grant us all the answers. We won\u2019t know everything.\n\nYou're not being rude at all. But you've repeatedly said that *god's most important message* is one that is lost because you said that it was written in a dead language and misunderstood. So if it's so important, it should be a contradiction that god is powerful and smart, but couldn't figure out that in mere hundreds of years, the most important message would be muddled and lost on most people. And this god's words would be used to cause so much misery and death to others as the last thousands of years have shown.\n\nHow is this different than the Sharpshooter fallacy? This is where you shoot up a barn, draw a target around each hole, and call every shot a bullseye. The heart of this contradiction is where some question what they believe about their god, and others just shrug and accept it calling it god's mystery. This is why asking what people believe and why is so fascinating because you can never be sure what open questions people accept or wrestle with. \n\n> As far as how I\u2019m able to live with the fact others are causing others hardship, it\u2019s not easy realizing this.

If you can't speak out against it, maybe just hope that you're not among the oppressed as so many expect to be. Perhaps, be glad that you can choose to blend in with the oppressors. Not all of us can do so.",

Labeling anyone who is pro choice demonic.\n\nAnd all the other things they feel is a threat to children.\n\nYet they are always quite when one of their own actually harms children.\n\nMakes you wonder do conservatives parents even give a fuck about kids or are they secretly ok with what happens. \n\nJust a thought because if they had a problem you would think they would be extra loud about the rampant problem of conservatives harming children.\n\nHeck I say people should call all conservatives pedophiles considering they love to demonize whole groups anyways.\n\n Considering they dont do much to fix the issue in their group I guess to be a conservative is to be a pedophile.",

When people\u2019s panties catch fire over \u201csharia law\u201d come to the US, my first reaction is underwhelm. You don\u2019t even know. Don\u2019t fucking pretend. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about at. all.\n\nNow I take the reproductive rights of women very seriously and I don\u2019t cotton to this shit that\u2019s going down one bit. But it is perfectly possible to make an argument against abortion that is moral in nature without bringing religion into it. As long as science has no consensus about when human life begins, the door is open for people to feel differently about it, and for some to say that infant life must be defended.\n\nI won\u2019t agree with that argument. But I\u2019m also not interested in bullshit lines of attack against it like \u201cit\u2019s sharia law come to the US - you know, not literal sharia, but you know what I mean rite guys?\u201d\n\nReproductive rights need to be defended as a matter of personal medical privacy and freedom, not on the grounds of separation of church and state. Some peoples feelings on this issue are religiously motivated, but this is not religious law.\n\nWhen it comes to church and state, trust me, you\u2019re a babe in the woods and don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. It also happens to be a losing argument here at home. So no, your \u201csharia law\u201d horse crap does nothing but perpetuate misconceptions about Muslims to stir up atheistic rage against religion, which is the worst possible tactical beginning of any effective response to the catastrophe we\u2019ve just seen. \n\nSo just put that shit away before you look like an islamophobe for no good reason.",

Until then, the Republicans align with that works for me.\n\nI was an on the fence person for years. I\u2019m now a hardcore Republican. Democrats simply haven\u2019t in the past 20 years supported a single issue that matters to me and affects me personally. They\u2019ve supported multiple causes that have taken away my rights, freedoms, and damaged my ability to earn a living by destroying the free market economy.",

One morning, a woman who had been a regular \u2018sidewalk counselor\u2019 went into the clinic with a young woman who looked like she was 16-17, and obviously her daughter. When the mother came out about an hour later, I had to go up and ask her if her daughter\u2019s situation had caused her to change her mind. \u2018I don\u2019t expect you to understand my daughter\u2019s situation!\u2019 she angrily replied. The following Saturday, she was back, pleading with women entering the clinic not to \u2018murder their babies.'\u201d\u00a0(Clinic escort, Massachusetts)",

I actually like the idea of state\u2019s having more power to do things the way they want to because, in the long run, it can do a couple of good things:\n\n1. It can give us a lot of different looks at different ways to solve problems (I.e. healthcare, education, welfare, taxes). More people trying to solve problems in different ways should help us realize what does and doesn\u2019t work a lot faster.\n\nAnd 2. It can slowly separate people of wildly different ideals. Theoretically this could lead to another civil war\u2026but I mean who is to say we aren\u2019t heading in that direction already, and at least this way some states should actually become significantly better and more accurately represent its people, as opposed to having to meet in the middle with the idiots on the other side of the country who are radically ignorant.\n\nI think the problem isn\u2019t state\u2019s rights, but rather our obsession in this country of telling other people what they can and can\u2019t do when it doesn\u2019t affect us.

Also, for what it is worth, the story the US tells is books is just\u2026ridiculous compared to the wars of independence in other countries.  The British Empire, like all colonial powers, was brutal in terms of oppressing, exploiting, and killing people for profit.  And I say this being British-Canadian.  Opposition was entirely rational.  Violence was often the only option (because asking nicely to stop doing these things\u2026does not work).  It is only now, looking back, that fights for independence, for rights, etc. often get rewritten as peaceful when taught, or violence is decried as exceptions or generally ineffective, to try to take away effective means of fighting back.  The oppressor doesn\u2019t ever want people to think hitting back is an option.\n\nIn the US, this is not the story of the war of independence.  It would be if it was the Indigenous peoples fighting to overthrow the British and kick them out\u2026but, and I\u2019m going to offend a lot of Americans I\u2019m sure, what we have are the story of the white colonists themselves complaining that they don\u2019t have enough wealth and power and rebelling against their own people for more.  The whole taxation without representation thing\u2026I never really bought it.  Most people at the time couldn\u2019t even vote, not even within mainland Britain.  It was limited to a very wealthy subset of landowners, who were all male because only men could own land.  And only within Scotland, Wales, and England (no one else was allowed to vote or had representatives).  Most people were not represented.  Most people would not be until the 1900s.  The US was not being treated especially shabbily.  In fact, much like Canada, they probably were being treated better than most colonies simply because of their circumstances, practically speaking they would have been allowed a great degree of independence (again, this is the colonists\u2026the Indigenous people, not so much).\n\nI always thought that, much as it usually is with war, it was really about the wealthy getting more wealth and power.  I mean, the US did implement a landowner voting system right off the bat.  They didn\u2019t think much for representation either.  Also, there\u2019s still that sticky issue of the territories which to this day don\u2019t have representation in the US.  So, the point is, I guess, I find people pointing at US independence as some struggle for rights to be ludicrous.  But it is very on point for people wanting to seize control, so I am unsurprised.",

Bernie was significantly more favored among independents than Hillary, and it was fairly evenly split among moderates.\n\nBottom line is the people that voted for Hillary in the primary have no one to blame but themselves, but seem to be in constant denial about it, pointing fingers at everyone but themselves.",

It wasn\u2019t atheists and humanitarians who decided slavery would be foundational to the formation of the nation\u2019s laws. \n\nIt\u2019s was Southern Christians who demanded northern states return freed slaves, than bitched about \u2018states\u2019 rights\u2019 when they lost an election, then a war, all because they wanted to own humans. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t Indigenous Americans who supported racial segregation, that was White Christians. \n\nWars in Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq? White Christians. Upcoming climate crisis? White Christians. 2009 housing collapse? White Christians. \n\nThey\u2019ve always been in power, so they have always been the ones behind any horsefucking of American society. And American society has almost always been some form of fucked up",

And pre-viability, that is a religious/philosophical question that the government has no business answering and that is best left to the individual. You know, exactly what Roe v. Wade allowed.

A terminal cancer patient who is in a coma from which they will not awake has rights - the rights of personhood.\n\nThere is one very clear line that exists that differentiates between a human life that I would grant personhood to, and one that I would not, and that is birth.\n\nBeyond that, you start getting into some grey territory. Is an 8 month old fetus a \"person?\" In my eyes, very likely yes. Is a 3 week old embryo a \"person?\" In my eyes, very clearly no. I tend to think that viability plays a huge role here, and I would not grant non-viable fetuses the rights of personhood. Medical science has pushed that window of viability further back, but not yet to the point that a fertilized egg can develop separate from its mother to the degree that one would in a mother and result in a live birth. *None of which actually matters on this discussion!*\n\nForget this question of \"when do we grant personhood to a fertilized egg/zygote/embryo/fetus?\" I don't care, and for purposes of moving past this irrelevant point, I'm willing to grant that at whatever point you consider a human fetus a \"person\" is where I will consider it a \"person.\" This is and has always been a question of bodily autonomy - *the* fundamental right granted to all \"persons.\"\n\nAs a \"person,\" you have the right to bodily autonomy - that is, you have the right of governance of your own body, the right to make decisions over you own life and your future. If your parents pierced your ears at a young age without your consent, or before you were old enough to grant your consent, they violated your bodily autonomy. You can't be forced to donate blood against your will (legally speaking) without violating your bodily autonomy. A child cannot be forced to donate blood, or a kidney, or a piece of their liver to their parent against their will, *even if it is the only thing that will save their life.*  We are so sure of this right to bodily autonomy that even after death you cannot be gutted for parts without your prior consent (being an organ donor) *even when* your organs may be/will be/ or are the only thing standing between someone else and death. No one can hook you up to another person to serve as their \"dialysis machine\" without your consent, unless they violate your right to bodily autonomy. \n\nAnd this is the point: women should be in control of their own bodies. They should have the same right to bodily autonomy as everyone else (men *and the deceased*). They should not be forced to sustain the life of another \"person\" without their consent, *regardless of the circumstances* that led to that choice to give or withhold their consent.",

Why doesn't consent to pregnancy constitute consent to pregnancy?\n\n-\n\nEdit because I see that we won't be getting a response from our delightful ideologue:\n\nThe answer to the question \"why does sex constitute consent to pregnancy\" is invariably \"because she knew that there was a possibility of getting pregnant before having sex which means she 'must have' consented to the pregnancy.\"\n\nWere this true and not overt sophistry, then why does going to the bar, where the possibility (no matter how remote) of having sex exists (even against your will), not by the very same logic constitute consent to sex? \n\nIf performing an act on purpose which has potential consequences that you don't like constitutes irrevocable consent to those outcomes (like the possibility of being raped when going to the bar or the possibility of becoming pregnant when having sex) then rape is not rape by this logic but by definition consensual sex agreed to a priori by putting yourself in a position to be raped. \n\nIt's dispicable victim-blaming of the highest order. \n\nAnd anyone peddling the idea that anything other than continous, affirmative consent to pregnancy constitutes consent to pregnancy is using 1:1 the logic of rape apologia.",

Separation of church and state is also dead now.\n\nIt's only a matter of time till they say laws about separate but equal, aka jim Crowe, are fine again, and declare the 19th amendment unconstitutional.\n\nAnd don't tell me I'm being hyperbolic...I've been told that for every single prediction I have made and they all have come true.",

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theologocal tyranny most of the jokes will go over a typical voter's head. There's also Clarence's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his rulings- his personal philosophy draws heavily from the Salem witch trials, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike forcing ten year olds to carry rape babies truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in a conservative's existential catchphrase \"States Rights,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to the Confederacy's treason against the United States. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Clarence Thomas's genius wit unfolds itself on their phone screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Gadsden Flag tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

They wanted to eliminate Judaism and Paganism, so they had people go around and help out the so-called Christians and pushed that and it took root and caught on quickly. And sort version it then moved and let those in power punish those of Judaism and Paganism, effectively almost eradicating them. \n\nAnd now there is so many bullshit branches of the \"Bible\" because they say well we don't believe in everything in the Bible; we each take out what we want to believe in and start religions based on only bits and pieces of the Bible. Go fuck yourselves! You cherry-picked the Bible to make it to your liking because you couldn't fully stand behind the Bible that was supposed to be written by Jesus's disciples and passed down through the centuries. And if you even dare say well it's interpreted by the individual, fuck you, the Bible wasn't there to be interpreted, it's there to be followed. If that is the case there would be a million different branches of Christianity in that case, being interpreted. Then the same would go for all the other religions in the countries around the world but you don't see that do you?!",

The people who make it are so steeped in religious fervor that everything is either reward or punishment (those that we dole out are just substitutes for god\u2019s judgement\u2026as in the prosperity gospel). So to them, an abortion is some kind of misplaced retribution against the rapist: a punishment *for* the rape. What they fail to see, though, is that an abortion isn\u2019t about punishing the father, it is about the mother\u2019s choice. A rape victim can choose to raise the child of their rapist, but they can also choose to not. She did not consent to sex and has no responsibility to carry the consequences (this is in response to the \u201cjust don\u2019t have risky sex\u201d argument\u2026I\u2019d argue that she is never obliged to carry the fetus).",

I personally believe that there is nothing extreme about being against causing suffering to animals that have the capacity to suffer. Animals can't consent to the harm they are subjected to or to being killed. Animals are already alive and don't want to die. A fetus is not sentient and cannot feel pain (at least not when the vast majority of abortions take place), therefore i do not care about its potential for those qualities, because that's not its current state. Conservative religious anti-choice folks are all about controlling others and pushing senseless religion down peoples throats. It's not actually rational. It's unfair to compare that to vegans because veganism is a logical position that makes sense - the philosophy that animals are not objects for us to use, abuse and slaughter. It is grounded in the tangible reality of this world - how we hurt animals in factory farming, in cosmetic testing, etc. That's real, that's real life. God is not real, religion and religious beliefs are not grounded in the tangible realities of the world. Sorry, i did have to say something. And trust me, i do *not* think i am better than anyone else for being vegan. I do not think i'm a good person at all actually. I just care deeply about animals and i don't want them to have to through pain when it's not necessary.",

That people will still find a way to get abortions even if it's illegal. He suggested that abortions were done out of fear that the person could not handle their life having a child they are impregnated with. That the real way to fight against abortions is to transform your relationships with people and to basically convert everyone to Christianity so that they will have no fear.  These people literally want to create a world where everyone thinks just like them and they'll do whatever deemed necessary to accomplish it.\nThe series is about \"how our God is a God of wrath, and how we should understand that thats exactly the kind of God we want to have\" \nI can't anymore man.",

I think you are coming from a view that places an immense level of significance on human life and I honestly just do not understand or feel that. Sorry not sorry but I just don\u2019t, and I don\u2019t see how anyone can when objectively observing and acknowledging our situation and place within the universe. Like I said, I have nothing further to add. And you\u2019re free to hold that view and live YOUR life by it. I just wish you\u2019d afford that same courtesy to the women affected by this decision, as I would any other similar decision that might affect people that don\u2019t want to be affected by it. You clearly don\u2019t care about that, and I\u2019ll get to that in a minute.\n\nI actually understand your \u201crat race circus\u201d comment despite what I\u2019m about to say because I do not now, nor have I ever, known what to do with myself and feel remarkably out of place most of the time. However, I don\u2019t let those feelings take away my empathy and compassion for others. I can\u2019t let it deter me from being accountable for how my decisions may affect anyone else.\n\nNow I\u2019ll get to you not caring. With that being said I truly think your view of liberty is unrealistic because it ignores the nature of the fact that we are in a shared space. It ignores the notion of organized human society entirely. You appear to want to operate as though it doesn\u2019t exist despite that it does and anytime you benefit from said society by participating in it by selectively heeding advice from experts and taking advantage of things that other people have invented, created, or implemented, you are using the knowledge discovered by others(this is what I\u2019m referring to when I mention a domain of expertise), while simultaneously not caring about the impact of your own actions. This makes you a hypocrite. Sorry not sorry, but that\u2019s what it is. Unless you live alone on a mountain, everything that you use and consume, including the associated knowledge, is the result of another human beings effort. Including whatever device you\u2019re using to have this conversation. That is an inescapable fact of life and to ignore it is both socially irresponsible and intellectually dishonest. And if you truly don\u2019t care despite that, then all you are doing is admitting to be being a terrible person.",

The line at which it becomes treason is when the actual planning of events takes place to end the government, like what Bannon was doing in his 'control room' on January 6th and what D.J. T was trying to do in the months leading to the election.\n\nHe knew he lost fairly, regardless of having his lies disproven by his own people repeatedly, he still made the claims knowing they were false. He tried every illegal move in the book including citing never before used laws in an attempt to steal office from our rightfully elected leader.\n\nTheir F\u00fcrher literally engaged in treason and clawed for the throat of the man who told him he couldn't hold the VP's decapitated head.\n\nAnd the right calls peaceful, legal protest insurrection.",

What he recommends is defiance or scorn. We can salvage our dignity, he appears to believe, by shaking a fist at the world which is deaf to our pleas, and con\u00adtinuing to live in spite of it. This will not make our lives un-absurd, but it will lend them a certain nobility.4\n\n>This seems to me romantic and slightly self-pitying. Our absurdity warrants neither that much distress nor that much defiance. At the risk of falling into romanticism by a different route, I would argue that absurdity is one of the most human things about us: a mani\u00adfestation of our most advanced- and interesting characteristics. \n\n\n>If a sense of the absurd is a way of perceiving our true situation (even though the situation is not absurd until the perception arises), then what reason can we have to resent or escape it? Like the capacity for epistemological skepticism, it results from the ability to understand our human limitations. It need not be a matter for agony unless we make it so. Nor need it evoke a defiant contempt of fate that allows us to feel brave or proud. Such dramatics, even if carried on in private, betray a failure to appreciate the cosmic unimportance of the situation. If sub specie aeternitatis there is no reason to believe that anything matters, then that doesn't matter either, and we can approach our absurd lives with irony instead of heroism or despair.\n\n\\- Thomas Nagel, \"The Absurd\"\n\nAnd I avoid as a rule mentioning education specifically because I don't like the impression it gives.

I usually respect it out of the fact that some people just require hope and wisdom to come from somewhere else, a way to perhaps cope with the human condition in some way. \n\nBut this stuff is just pure nonsense. Dictating a way a person lives by systematically changing laws to suit religious needs feels like the least American thing a person could possibly do or want. \n\nI struggle to understand what\u2019s so hard about leaving people the fk alone. Why is it so important that these clowns dictate how we live our lives? Is that a god thing? To be an oppressor? Because I don\u2019t remember reading that anywhere in the Bible, just in history books.",

The nice thing about fascist regimes is they _always_ destroy themselves in fairly short order.\n\nAnd in our particular case, it seems our fascist regime is gonna be fairly hostile to all of our major allies, which is even better.  We will cut ourselves off from the institutions & international organizations that we set up in order to establish the US empire & thereby destroy the US empire.\n\nEven now, regions that were once considered to be firmly US controlled defiantly move out from under our sphere of influence, as is currently the case with nearly all of Latin America.  And with China offering a better alternative to IMF & World Bank loans, even that is already well out of our control",

The supreme court is supposed to be a check on the presidency and Congress (and technically state government also) to ensure that laws passed don't break the initial rights enumerated.\n\nWhat has happened is that the SC has decided (along partisan lines) that the interpretation of the constitution (I believe the 14th amendment?) Actually can't be used to support the legal argument or forth 50 years ago in Roe vs Wade and has removed that power from the federal government and devolved it back to state government.\n\nRather than 1 requirement for all states instead we now have 50 separate state laws including bans, partial bans, no change etc.\n\nThis can be 'fixed' by amending the constitution and enshrining something as a right, it has been done before but needs 3/4 support from the states (38/50), this is extremely unlikely on something like this.",

If you want to play technical games, the  \n\n\nLate term abortions, which are abortions that occur after the point in time the fetus could possibly maybe survive on the outside, are rare and almost never happen and when they do its because of medical necessity.  \n\n\nNow since this thread is talking about abortions in general so in CONTEXT, we aren't talking about a situation where a baby could even be born much less survive.    \n\n\nNow you don't have any nuance in your response and statement.   You dont differentiate between someone getting raped today and getting an abortion done in two weeks vs the situation you brought up now where it comes out a minute later and there's a baby.  \n\n\nLike that isn't even a thing that was ever going on in the first place mate.  98 or so percent of abortions are conducted before 21 weeks hits.  Of those, 90 percent or so are done before 14 weeks.  \n\n\nHow about you define at what point is an abortion murdering a rape baby and lets go from there.  Becaues right now it seems like youre either defining all abortions as murder regardless of context or time since sex, or youre trying to imply there are actually people committing infanticide despite us knowing that virtually all abortions are done before 21 weeks.",

Facebook is designed to contain a lot of private and personal information, usually found in comments in the form of photos and names. This basically makes Facebook incompatible with the [rules of reddit](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205183175-Is-posting-someone-s-private-or-personal-information-okay-). \n\nHere are some alternatives...\n\n * if it's a photo you want to show, you can download it or screenshot it and upload it to an anonymous image file hosting website like imgur.com or minus.com. If it has some personal info on it, you should probably block that out (blur, black rectangles).  And don't forget to read the image rules on /r/atheism before posting.\n \n * if it's a special Facebook page, you can just mention its name and remind users to use the inner Facebook search engine\n\n * if it's a discussion, you can take a screenshot (and color out or blur names and faces) and upload it to some image file hosting website...  or you can copy/paste the text content\n\n * if it's a video, try looking for a copy of that video on some other website, like YouTube, it may already be posted. If you can't find it and can't download and upload the video somewhere else, the best idea is to summarize the points in the video or describe the relevant parts of it.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

      "text": "There's lots of reasons I left but one reason was I couldn't get sober around all the people who told me to consider abortion before I had a miscarriage that I was then told by those same people it was God's plan since I wasn't \"ready.\" I learned I had a choice and then didn't have a choice. I was raised by a catholic conservative family and I didn't know I had a choice to even think about not having that baby. And when those people who I needed to be excited for me heard the news, IT WAS TREATED AS A RUMOR. I WAS 23. DATING SOMEONE FOR OVER A YEAR LIVING ON MY OWN SINCE I WAS 17. \nMy decision to leave came after I organized games for kids at a picnic thrown by one of the aunts and uncles who suggested \"options\" to me during my pregnancy. As I finished the kids' games and wandered back over to the adults, some family members asked me about my job. I had worked for the aunt and uncle who suggested abortion after my miscarriage for about a year and seven month before finding a better job. My aunt refused to pay me commission even after I earned my P&C license in 3 months. So anyway, that aunt says, \"raise your hand if you think ---- is an adult.\" And I left and never talked to them again. Saddest part? \nI used to live with them and of course she had 2 boys in her early 40's with my dad's brother who is her 2nd husband because she wanted babies with him. Okay. Fine. But these boys (twins) were so neglected. I helped her as a nanny when they were born and she just seemed to experience that time so much differently than I saw with my mom and my 5 siblings. She wasn't happy at all. After the twins were born, it was almost like because she didn't feel satisfied still, she immediately was bored with them. I taught them games outside, how to make a snowball, how to \"make science\" in the kitchen with baking soda and vinegar, how to use stencils.. I used to read to them before bed. And one night one of the twins looks in my eyes and says \"I wish you were my mom.\" And I cried for days every time I thought of it because I felt sad and missed my own miscarriage that his mom had told me I wasn't \"ready\" for anyway. \n\nSo long story short, no one in Ohio believes this stuff and as soon as people start having some courage, and they speak up for their own family, this kind of stuff doesn't even become a factor. As soon as it's about them, its different. But in regions where women hate other young women who they view as \"competition\" even though we dont want your lives.. we want our own... Men and women in the midwest, they view the family unit as a status symbol and not what it really is, an immense privilege that requires honesty and grit.\n\nSo I don't know what could change at all in the future. These women are held hostage by their own ideologies and cognitive distortions and manufactured obligations. And it's not ending unless we give these families resources and support and expose the faltiness that it will transform into something other than a clear indication of a decaying society.",

And how all the connections and money at his disposal got him very limited time in jail? If the wages of rape were death, and explicitly by public execution, there would have been no exemption even for him.\n\nBeing pro-life and pro-death penalty are not mutually exclusive. When sin (which IS lawlessness) is committed by someone, they know what they are doing. So if someone wants so badly to rape a child, they therefore should know what risk they are up against. \n\nBut ok let\u2019s take it a step further even. Looking at Levitical Law; when it comes to of-aged cases of rape: the LAW is that if a woman who is married is raped within the city and she doesn\u2019t cry out for help, then both her and her rapist are to be put to death. If a married woman is raped outside the city gates, then only her rapist is to be put to death. If a woman who is not married is raped, then her rapist is forced to pay a fee to her family and then must marry the woman he raped.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure we can all agree that both cases of modern day judicial law and Levitical Law handle cases of rape in a way that the best option is to have every of-age and able-bodied woman know how to defend themselves with firearms. An armed society is a polite society. And in cases of women who are unconscious, or drugged, if the case is presented and the evidence is found; if there are wittinesses who know the weight of the punishment that is on the line; then public execution just like those who want to rape under-aged women.",

You're not standing up for the innocent, you're choosing which innocent person has to suffer the consequences.\n\nAnd yes, it is suffering for the mother. Pregnancy can already be a taxing ordeal for an adult, but for a ten-year-old child, pregnancy is horrible and dangerous. For the sake of your moral high ground, you'd condemn a child to suffer while it's entirely possible that it will result in permanent damage or even death.\n\nAnd that's only even if you believe that a fetus is a person with rights, which is nonsense. It's a clump of cells which can develop into a person in due time, but it's most definitely not a person yet.\n\nTo protect a clump of cells which by all accounts is incapable of thought, emotion, or sensation, which simply cannot suffer no matter what you do to it, you'd tell a child that she just has to accept that she got raped and deal with the aftermath, even if that involves scarring her physically and mentally for life.\n\nYour moral high ground is ground zero for a tactical nuke strike.",

According to the CDC, abortions occurring 18 weeks or later consisted of 2.6% of all abortions in 2019.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/ss/ss7009a1.htm\n\n---\n\nFor the love of god please stop letting these people control the narrative like this. I'm really tired of seeing so many cheap \"it's barbaric murder\" posts go unchallenged when they're just so blatantly and purposefully wrong. You don't need to argue with the person, especially in situations like this where they're obviously acting in bad faith, but it's still worth correcting them for the people you don't know are reading the post.",

It\u2019s better to have an abortion early if possible, but there are a multitude of reasons why that might not be possible, including many medical reasons the pregnancy is no longer viable. I always put the health and well being of the mother over the fetus, and describing the process of removing the fetus isn\u2019t going to suddenly make me think availability of the procedure is any less essential.\n\nAs for your claim that probably 90% of abortions are girls who took no precautions, I have no idea where you pulled that figure from. Based on your wording, I\u2019m going to guess you have no idea how many girls didn\u2019t use precautions, and how many did but they didn\u2019t work(broken condoms, birth control didn\u2019t work, etc). And then what about the 10 percent in your estimate, that were raped, or have a medical issue, or so on. You don\u2019t think they deserve to get an abortion to save there lives? \n\nThe truth is, it\u2019s easier for anti-abortion people to claim most abortions are frivolous and assume everything is the woman\u2019s fault than have to face the harsh reality that there are a lot of women that are hurt by outlawing abortions. The world isn\u2019t morally black and white, and sometimes you have to decide what is the best choice between two unfortunate choices. That choice should be made by the woman in consultation with her doctor and loved ones, not by random strangers that don\u2019t really understand the specific situation she is facing.",

True she had to travel across state lines, but yes she still did get one.  Do I think that exceptions need to be made in these cases?  Absolutely!!  When a 10 yr old rape victim has to go to such extremes to get a medical procedure then yes I think that this issue needs to be revisited and exceptions need to be put into place.  You think most conservatives are for a federal ban but you are incorrect.  Maybe the lawmakers, but not all conservatives in general.  I think you'd fine that most conservatives use common sense about this issue and their beliefs aren't necessarily in line with conservative lawmakers.",

At least she isn't being forced to marry the rapist as many are, for example from a 2017 NYT article: [11 Years Old, a Mom, and Pushed to Marry Her Rapist in Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/opinion/sunday/it-was-forced-on-me-child-marriage-in-the-us.html):\n\n>Johnson, the former 11-year-old unwitting bride who is now fighting for Florida to set a minimum marriage age (there is none now), says that her family attended a conservative Pentecostal church and that other girls of a similar age periodically also married. Often, she says, this was to hide rapes by church elders.\n\n>She says she was raped by both a minister and a parishioner and gave birth to a daughter when she was just 10 (the birth certificate confirms that). **A judge approved the marriage to end the rape investigation**, she says, telling her, \u201cWhat we want is for you to get married.\u201d\n\n>\u201cIt was a terrible life,\u201d Johnson recalls, recounting her years as a child raising children. She missed school and remembers spending her days changing diapers, arguing with her husband and struggling to pay expenses. She ended up with pregnancy after pregnancy \u2014 nine children in all \u2014 while her husband periodically abandoned her.\n\n>**\u201cThey took the handcuffs from handcuffing him,\u201d** she says, referring to the risk he faced of arrest for rape, **\u201cto handcuffing me, by marrying me without me knowing what I was doing.\u201d**",

Nothing about the article says anything about religion and based on my brief research on the roe case, the decision doesn't seem to be based in religion either. It's not like all christians are pro-life and all atheists are pro-choice. It seems to be that this is just an instance where a banning due to pro-life people has caused an injustice, with religion playing no part. So don't see why christians in particular would take the brunt of the accusations.",

Because you can also discredit atheists for the same thing (it would really depend on the statistics which I haven't looked up) since atheists also have reason to be pro-life.
