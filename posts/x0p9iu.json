We needed the strength of numbers, of our country's citizens, so of course religion and 'us against them' worked for the whole group. Everyone kept together & kept safe fighting together. I'm sure it kept human societies safe for a long time. But we, the ppl don't need to hate each other like the Military Industrial Complex needs us to hate each other. Anyway, women are on their way & I wish I'd still be able to be alive when we get closer to equality. Cool to be here now though, knowing it's coming!",

I would think that it was done traditionally due to the physical differences between men & women leading to men dominating the league, and those physical differences are not going away. \n\nA combined league would just lead to women not getting representation in the sport. Limited positions, men overwhelmingly fit those positions better, women would rarely get a position.

The parents that never gave a shit about this stupid rule will send their kids to tryouts for rival football teams and the issue kind of solves itself.\n\nThe problem is if they double down.

The bill will fail but christians take that as proof of the state/federal governments being anti-religious.",

Good riddance.\n\nI hated it when it just happened to boys. Throwing girls into the meat grinder does not seem to help anything. Football is simulated warfare. Nothing more nothing less. I hate the game.\n\nThey almost banned the game in 1925 after hundreds of kids got killed or paralyzed. Adding passing to the game was an attempt to stop the game being made illegal in high schools. In 1925 lol. \n\nhttps://www.innovativehistory.com/ih-blog/how-football-was-almost-banned-in-america\n\nI always wonder why people like beating the living hell out of each other in a muddy field. I never got it. Just a damn slaughter of innocents.\n\nEdit, they changed the game after hundreds of deaths in high schools in 1904",

Monica Lewinsky heavily perused & seduced a president who never would have seen her otherwise but people act as it it\u2019s impossible for an adult woman to decide she wants to bang the leader of the free word all on her own. \n\nAt least let adult women decide for themselves if they were victimized.

Ideal scenario there would be a girls league, but there isn't. \n\n*Edit*\nAlso tackling people stronger then you isn't super difficult, you just hit em in the legs or pile on as a group(weight probably is the biggest factor tbh).

How many other schools did you compete against?\n\n\\> A few teams, including my sister's, made it to state-level competition.\n\nThats awesome, I was in speech competitions too. My school treated OotM more like an extracurricular and less like a competition.\n\n\\> Sports don't teach that lesson any better than anything else.\n\nI disagree. You sister definitely learned teamwork skills and everything that is important you need to know to be in a team. \n\nIt is different when you physically put you body on the line. Imagine your sister is in OotM and presenting her subject, then imagine she is doing is after running 5 miles with her team. The presentations would be drastically different.\n\nBut if your sister and her team spent EVERY morning for 6 months running, preparing for the presentation so they wouldnt be winded while talking... they would grow much closer as a team then they would if they just gave the presentation normally and didnt see each other every single morning for the run.\n\nSilly example, but i think it makes my point",

A lot of sexist and derisive comments being thrown around. \n\nWhen my son began to wrestle over ten years ago one of the first things I noticed was how much more common it was to see girls wrestling and how little others took notice of it occurring. It\u2019s still not completely common place for a girl to wrestle, but when they do its seen as completely unremarkable. People just let her wrestle and move on with their day. No big fuss is made one way or another. \n\nThere are even all girl tournaments held to give more opportunity to get on the mat. Some other positive signs are all girl teams are being sanctioned by some states on the high school level and by the NCAA on the collegiate level. I was pleasantly surprised to note how much things had progressed in the years since I had been in high school. There is still a lot of work to be done, but it\u2019s good to see actual progress like this.",

The area is a grey area in regards to how she will be treated (conscious or subconsciously). When the fact is, she knows the game she signed up to play and wants the experience.

      "text": "Story time -\n\nI played football (offensive tackle and defensive end) for a small Christian school in the general area of this team many years ago (20, to be exact). One game, the other team sent in a girl to play defensive end on the opposite side of the ball from me, she was maybe 5'7\" and probably 120-150 while I was 5'11\" and 230 lbs. My offensive coach called a trap play, which basically lures a defensive end over the line of scrimmage while the opposite side offensive tackle pulls behind the line and trucks the defensive end. In hindsight, I know my coach called this play on purpose, but I had a choice to make\n\n* go easy on this girl, and possibly fuck up the block/play and look like a wuss getting beat by a girl, or\n\n* treat her like any other player and lay her out and look like an asshole for it. \n\nUltimately I went with the latter. Ball snaps and I pull, see immediately she has no idea I'm coming and basically tossed her a good 5 yards. It took a hot minute for her to get back up but she was out for the rest of the game.\n\nI still think about that game 20 years later. I hate that my coach put me in that situation.",

So the only remotely pragmatic reason for forfeiting like this is just because you\u2019re not used to the idea, and the better solution for that problem is to stick with it and see it through.

To a team of *15 year old boys*.\n\nLikewise, venus and serena williams, possible the best female tennis players in the world, were both beaten by a male player that was ranked something like number 28, or something?\n\nIf you look at  the stats, most of the top female athletes wouldn't break into even the top 100 for the mens categories, and that's true across most sports.\n\nI think only free diving or something shows women having a natural advantage over men.\n\nI mean I'm all for equality, but lets not poison the well by saying things that are just not scientifically true.",

No end.\n\nOn the news today, a report that there's a school in Southern California that leased a school building from the school district to start a school this fall. The lease they signed said, among many things, that the school would have to agree to not discriminate in hiring teachers or other staff on religious or other grounds.\n\nThe school immediately turned away any teacher and staff applicants that weren't kristian.\n\nThe district told them they had violated the terms of the lease and couldn't open.\n\nThe school hired an attorney who stated that kristian schools are not bound by secular law and any provisions in the lease the school disagreed with were not enforceable.\n\nI hope it gets ugly. These smug assholes need to be kicked to the curb.\n\nBurroughs was wrong, apparently. Even getting it in writing is meaningless to these worthless arrogant sanctimonious assholes.\n\n\"If you are doing business with a religious son-of-a-bitch, get it in writing! His word isn't worth shit, not with the good Lord telling him how to fuck you on the deal...\"                          --William S. Burroughs",

Differences in build, muscle mass, bone density - I'd be worried about hurting someone. Women and men are not built the same, while neither is \"better\" we excel at different things (nit to mention that a person's worth goes beyond their mere physical prowess) and putting teenage girls on a football field with teenage boys is *asking* for trouble.
