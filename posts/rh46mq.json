We cannot abandon our brothers and sisters in these states, and we cannot allow ourselves to fall to division.  That's exactly what they want.  We need to target the real problem - the fact that they are rigging elections as we speak and the fact that they're openly fascist now.  We need to fight the republican party itself, not on a voting or optics level, but on the streets.  Protest.  Make the french proud, do so over their shitty voting laws, over their fucked up abortion laws and their court stacking and all of it.

Manslaughter is a legal term that narrowly defines a set of crimes. The whole point of a trial is to determine whether a killing qualifies as a crime - i.e. murder or manslaughter. If you're found not guilty, you may still have killed somebody, but it was not criminal.\n\nYou're using legal language inappropriately. I don't know how else to clarify it for you.\n\nEdit: In case you're stuck on this point, \"not guilty\" means the trial could not prove a crime occured; \"innocent\" means it proved a crime *did not occur*. Either way, describing the act in question with a term that legally defines a crime is incorrect. It's foundational to our legal system that crimes must be proven.",
