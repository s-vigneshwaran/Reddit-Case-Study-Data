The question is why Trump doesn't want them to be a part of the record.\n\n>Aren\u2019t Presidential records the property of the National Archives, not the previous occupant of the Office of the President?\n\nYup, as an extension of 'We the People'. We have a right to see what decisions were made, who helped make them, what was discussed and how conclusions were reached. Trump seems to be worried about what is in some of these documents.",

Usually if someone misplaces records that can be a privacy violation and some kind of violation of public trust - maybe criminal, maybe not.\n\nIf you misplace classified information, *especially* with a profit motive, you're getting into criminal liability for espionage. \n\nThe National Archives are about historical interest and having the data needed to make better decisions in the future. Very important.\n\nBut classification protects things like diplomatic negotiations and intelligence sources - more of an acute problem when they leak. \n\nI'm not a big fan of keeping public secrets but it can be an unfortunate necessity when international relationships can turn suddenly hostile. And it was bad enough when Trump was in office, giving away the exact images taken by surveillance satellites. (Great, now everyone knows what we can *and can't* see.)",
