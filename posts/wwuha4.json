Should poor people be forced to have their kids indoctrinated in religion in public schools (the only school they can afford) by force of law?  Of course not.  Allowing religious indoctrination in public schools amounts to government imposing religion on kids by force of law, which is exactly why it is *illegal*.",

Evidence of chocolate meteors is impossible to get, just because some moron believes that meteors are made of chocolate does not mean that I need to take anything that person says seriously.  It's a load of garbage, if it was real, we wouldn't need to call it \"supernatural\" or rely on \"belief\", these things would be called \"facts\" instead.\n\nWhat's more, I think your assertion that \"a lot of humans need to believe in something  bigger or outside themselves\" is faulty.  To the contrary, lying to oneself is harmful, and falsely claiming that you have all the answers interrupts personal growth.  Just saying \"God did it\", prevents us from searching out the truth ourselves.  When the bible says it's wrong to ..., the reader isn't acting like a good person to be a good person, they're doing it to avoid punishment.  A person with actual morals does things because they understand that actions have consequences, and they want to be responsible for their own sake, not because they were told what to and what not to do.\n\nAnd regarding fairy tales, there's really no difference here.  Fairy tales have no evidence to back them up, and neither do religions, they're both fiction.  I guess the major difference is that people aren't fooled into believing that Grimm's fairy tales are real, where the bible has been used for several millenium to fool people into believing it's real.  But at the end of the day, they're both just books, written by men, full of tall tales in a fantasy world with rules and physics that make no sense in the real world.",

I have the Atheist flair, can't you see? I'm not a religious person and I advocate for not indoctrinating kids with religion ***anywhere***, not just schools. Let them decide on their 18th year as an adult whether to start with this religion thingy, and not indoctrinate them as kids which absorbs all information they get as mostly true *because my parents said it was true therefore it really must be true*.\n\n>let me mock them for being religious because people MUST always be one of only types.\n\nReally? People being religious depend on their faith and beliefs, they don't use their critical thinking skills to really discern what is highly unlikely to happen or not.  If these kids can just blindly take whatever other people say as the truth, what else can they get misinformed? Politics, perhaps, scientific knowledge, and also the general world? Maybe think about that first.\n\n Perhaps mocking is totally fine? Because they are ***delusional***? That a dude that's invisible, loves you but will put you to a scary place if you don't love him back? Is he really an omnibenevolent being if he can't do shit about the wars, hunger, political shit happening all around the world? If I were god, I would instantly stop all those nonsense.

If there are gods but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones.\u201d\n\nBrown, Justin  \u201cIf the bible is mistaken in telling us where we came from, how can we trust it to tell us where we're going.\u201d\n\nBrown, Lindsey \u201cWhen inventing a god, it's important to make sure it's invisible, inaudible, and imperceptible in every way. Otherwise, people will be skeptical when it appears to no one, is silent, and does nothing.\u201d\n\nDawkins \u201cWe are all atheists about most of the gods that humanity has ever believed in. Some of us just go one god further.\u201d\n\nEinstein, Albert  \u201cA man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.\u201d\n\nEpicurus  \u201cIs God willing to prevent evil but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?\u201d\n\nGervais, Rickey \u201cIt\u2019s a strange myth that atheists have nothing to live for. It\u2019s the opposite. We have nothing to die for. We have everything to live for.\u201d\n\nGervais, Rickey \u201cReligion\u2019s greatest trick wasn\u2019t convincing some people that there was a god that was all powerful, it was convincing everyone else that you couldn\u2019t ridicule the idea\u201d\n\nGervais, Rickey \u201cthere have been nearly 3000 gods so far but only yours actually exists.

To say God is good because of some positive thing that happened to you, while at the same time a priest is raping a child, is peak narcissism. Given all the good that your God does NOT visit upon others, to believe he is a force for good resulting from the good you feel he visits upon YOU is not just arrogant, it's morally reprehensible.\"\n\nHarris, Sam \u201cIf someone doesn't value evidence, what evidence are you going to provide to prove that they should value it? If someone doesn't value logic, what logical argument could you provide to show the importance of logic?\u201d\n\nHarris, Tracie \"You either have a God who sends child rapists to rape children or you have a God who simply watches it and says, \u2018When you\u2019re done, I\u2019m going to punish you.\u2019If I could stop a person from raping a child, I would. That\u2019s the difference between me and your God.\"\n\nHarwood, William \u201cThe difference between faith and insanity is that faith is the ability to hold firmly to a conclusion that is incompatible with the evidence, whereas insanity is the ability to hold firmly to a conclusion that is incompatible with the evidence.\u201d\n\nHitchens, Christopher  \u201cGod loves you so much he created hell in case you don't love him back.\u201d\n\nHitchens, Christopher  \u201cWhat can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence\u201d\n\nIzzard, Eddie \u201cIf there is a god, his plan is very similar to someone not having a plan.\u201d\n\nLamott, Anne \"You can safely assume you've created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do.\"\n\nLincoln, Abraham \u201cThe Bible is not my book and Christianity is not my religion. I could never give assent to the long complicated statements of Christian dogma.\u201d\n\nMoriarty, John  \u201cIf god has a problem with me, it can tell me itself. When you speak on behalf of your deity, it sounds more like your opinion.\u201d\n\nNietzche - \u201cA casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Briain, Dara \u201cJust because science doesn\u2019t know everything doesn\u2019t mean you can fill in the gaps with whatever fairy tale most appeals to you.\u201d\n\nPirsig, Robert  \u201cWhen one man suffers from delusion, it is insanity, when many men suffer from delusion, it is called religion.\u201d\n\nPratchett, Terry \u201cThe presence of those seeking the truth is infinitely to be preferred to the presence of those that think they have found it.\u201d\n\nRa, Aron \u201cAny being worthy of worship would not require it.\"\n\nRichard Jeni: You're basically killing each other to see who's got the best imaginary friend\"\n\nSagan, Carl \"If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth.\"\n\nSherlock, Michael  \u201cChristianity did not become a major religion by the quality of its truth, but by the quantity of its violence.\u201d\n\nTwain, Mark \u201cThe Bible has noble poetry in it... and some good morals and a wealth of obscenity, and upwards of a thousand lies.\u201d\n\nTwain, Mark \u201cIt ain't the parts of the Bible that I can't understand that bother me, it is the parts that I do understand.\u201d\n\nUnknown  You keep believing, I'll keep evolving.\n\nUnknown \u201cWhen an honest man discovers he is mistaken, he will either cease to be mistaken or cease to be honest.\u201d\n\nVoltaire \u201cThose who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.\u201d\n\nWeinberg, Steven \u201cWith or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things.

Jesus did not die for us. Our ancestors did.\u201d Northern Cheyenne Indian warrior\n\nRoberts, Stephen (1917-1999) \u201cI contend that we are both atheists.

When you speak on behalf of your deity, it sounds more like your opinion.\u201d\n\nZappa, Frank (1940-1993) \u201cAnybody who wants religion is welcome to it, as far as I'm concerned--I support your right to enjoy it. However, I would appreciate it if you exhibited more respect for the rights of those people who do not wish to share your dogma, rapture, or necrodestination.\u201d\n\nPratchett, Terry (1948-2015) \u201cThe presence of those seeking the truth is infinitely to be preferred to the presence of those that think they have found it.\u201d\n\nHitchens, Christopher (1949-2011) \u201cGod loves you so much he created hell in case you don't love him back.\u201d\n\nHitchens, Christopher (1949-2011) \u201cTo terrify children with the image of hell, to consider women an inferior creation\u2014is that good for the world?\u201d\n\nHitchens, Christopher (1949-2011) \u201cWe must be afraid, we must also be forced to love someone who we fear, the essence of sado-masochism.\u201d\n\nHitchens, Christopher (1949-2011) \u201cWhat can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence\u201d\n\nJeni, Richard (1957-2007) \u201cYou're basically killing each other to see who's got the best imaginary friend\"\n\nCapt.

To say God is good because of some positive thing that happened to you, while at the same time a priest is raping a child, is peak narcissism. Given all the good that your God does NOT visit upon others, to believe he is a force for good resulting from the good you feel he visits upon YOU is not just arrogant, it's morally reprehensible.\"\n\nHarris, Sam (age 55) \u201cIf someone doesn't value evidence, what evidence are you going to provide to prove that they should value it? If someone doesn't value logic, what logical argument could you provide to show the importance of logic?\u201d\n\nHarris, Sam (age 55) \u201cWe have a choice. We have two options as human beings. We have a choice between conversation and war. That's it. Conversation and violence.

You see, if we take something like any fiction, any holy book\u2026 and destroyed it, in a thousand years\u2019 time, that wouldn\u2019t come back just as it was. Whereas if we took every science book, and every fact, and destroyed them all, in a thousand years they\u2019d all be back, because all the same tests would [produce] the same result.\"\n\nGervais, Ricky (age 61) \u201cIt annoys me that the burden of proof is on us. It should be \"you came up with the idea, why do you believe it?\" I can tell you I've got super powers. But I can't go up to people saying \"prove I can't fly\", because then they'll say \"what do you mean prove you can't fly? Prove you can!\"\n\nGervais, Ricky (age 61) \u201cIt\u2019s a strange myth that atheists have nothing to live for. It\u2019s the opposite. We have nothing to die for. We have everything to live for.\u201d\n\nGervais, Ricky (age 61) \u201cReligion\u2019s greatest trick wasn\u2019t convincing some people that there was a god that was all powerful, it was convincing everyone else that you couldn\u2019t ridicule the idea\u201d\n\nGervais, Ricky (age 61) \u201csaying atheism is a belief system is like saying \"not going skiing is a hobby\". I've never been skiing. It's my favourite pass time.

I have a copy of the Gregory Hays translation, which says this:\n\n>You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. If the gods exist, then to abandon human beings is not frightening; the gods would never subject you to harm. And if they don\u2019t exist, or don\u2019t care what happens to us, what would be the point of living in a world without gods or Providence? But they do exist, they do care what happens to us, and everything a person needs to avoid real harm they have placed within him. If there were anything harmful on the other side of death, they would have made\nsure that the ability to avoid it was within you. If it doesn\u2019t harm your character, how can it harm your life? Nature would not have overlooked such dangers through failing to recognize them, or because it saw them but was powerless to prevent or correct them. Nor would it ever, through inability or incompetence, make such a mistake as to let good and bad things happen indiscriminately to good and bad alike. But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful\u2014and hence neither good nor bad.",

I think it was a paraphrase, which is kind of what this Marcus Aurelius quote is. I think it's good to attribute as best as we can, but also listen to the message.\n\nYour list is great, by the way.

If parents don't want their kids learning about gay, bisexual, trans and lesbians and etc. That's the parent being problematic to their child, not the school being problematic to the parent",
