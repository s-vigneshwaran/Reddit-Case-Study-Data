  "text": "TIFU by making a bet with my 8yo daughter\nMy kid is Minecraft mad and has been since she was 5 years old. She's a great builder and comes up with really interesting creations. But she's stuck on consoles and her iPad and has been making noises about wanting mods for the past 18 months. I keep telling her bedrock doesn't do mods and she always replies with \"well buy me a computer\".  \n\nWell two weeks ago we were talking about her gym class she goes to where they do fun physical fitness stuff for kids. Its at a real gym with real gym instructors. She said they did a plank for 30 seconds as part of her class. And I (stupidly) said if you can beat my plank time id buy her a computer. Now my time is 2.25. And my wifes is around 3.15. \n\nSo the gym instructor asked all the kids what their goals are this year. Just a general life thing not related specifically to physical fitness. Some said stuff like \"read more\" or \"finish X game\" etc. my kid says \"To do a 4 minute plank\".  Well the instructor suddenly had something he could work with. So he said \"ok lets do that!\". \n\nIn my kids bravado she had forgotten the original bet was 2.26 or better. In doing so she overshot it by a fair way and made it considerably harder for herself\n\nBy the end she was a sweaty crying mess, her form had gone to hell but it was definitely still a plank. The instructor yelled 4 minutes and she said \"can i stop now?\" between tears and heavy breathing. She stopped at 4.08. \n\nAnyway, whats a good mid level graphics card for Minecraft with some shaders?\n\nTL;DR Made a stupid bet with my kid about buying her a PC if she beat my plank time. I lost and am now poor.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the replies, generous offers of parts and build specs! Wow this blew up while I was asleep on Australia time. She woke up this morning and I said \"Are you sore from yesterday?\" and she says \"No why?\". Well, now im really annoyed. Promise i'll post an update.",

So my dad jokes with my sister that if she can do 100 he'll buy a horse. \n\nShe did 108\n\nHorse's name was Rusty.",

My childhood pony, a paint stallion (until he was 9, then he got chopped), named Dallas, taught me a lot about pain and built character.\n\nMy funniest memory with the little shit (we affectionately called him \"little shit cow pony\") was when I was jumping one day and he kept running out to one side of the jump instead of jumping. He could only run out to the left, the right was the arena gate. So my instructor blocked off the left by standing there.\n\n She says, 'beat thar pony!\", Which you can still hear her yell to this day, and I come in *fast* and we're in line for the jump and he doesn't run out. No. He slams on the fucking brakea and I go over the jump without a pony and he knows he's in deep shit and runs my instructor over.\n\nShe's swearing like a riding instructor from Britain and gets on him (she was small) and he's listening now. We weren't being cruel, we didn't beat him, he was being a dickhead, like most ponies tend to be, and testing limits.\n\nGood god, I fucking miss asshole ponies. Judges loved this pony, but he could be so goddamn bad. Another favourite pony of mine was \"Pony Soprano\" who we called \"Tony\" for short who pretty much jumped a jump or two and bucked off his rider and ran around.",

I knew my daughter valued the daddy/daughter time, so I told my son, \"Sorry bud, you can't go unless you can play the game, and you need to be able to read the cards and do the math for the cards' health to be able to play.\"  At this point he was barely reading board books, I figured I had at least half a year or so.\n\nA week later he walked up to me with a deck he put together and read through every card and explained how many hit points randomly-selected pairs of cards would have after attacking each other.  I then proceeded to pull random cards from my daughter's stash, figuring he just memorized the ones in his deck.  He read all those to me too.\n\nSo that was how my son managed to end my six-month dodge, five and three quarters months early.",

By his 4th birthday he could divide. At my nieces birthday party, when he was 3, we got her some books to be read to her, and he sat on the couch reading them, and he'd pip up once in a while, \"what does *word* mean?\" And he didn't \"sound it out\" like most kids, he'd just say it. He then told us about the books. When he was 3, they were told he was functioning around that of a 6 or 7 year old.\n\nHe's 7 now and this year he wanted Rubix cubes and Minecraft stuff. Also rocks and minerals. Due to shitty weather when my mom had them over, she took them to Michaels and now we have a helium tank, about 300 balloons, whatever Zorbs are we have 4 bags of, a volcano kit, 6 boxes of baking soda, 2 tents, they glitter glued the balloons to... everything.

That wall could be in high school, it could be college, it could be grad school, or maybe even his career. But if all he\u2019s heard for most of his life is how smart he is, and never learned to struggle, his world will shatter and it can cause serious depression and self worth issues. \n\nEvery \u201csmart kid\u201d that I knew growing up, myself included, that never had to work hard for success as a kid ended up hitting a *hard* wall, usually around college. Suddenly you can\u2019t just walk through everything anymore, but people around you are succeeding still - because they had to work much harder for it so they know how to study and such. \n\nThis caused me to drop out of my first college and lose a very, very good once in a lifetime type opportunity at a well renowned university. I\u2019m in a good place now, but this all could have been avoided if I learned young the importance of knowing how to study, and not having my natural intelligence be a source of pride and self esteem. Once I could no longer keep up, I lost a lot of my self esteem \n\nSorry if this is a lot of text about advice you never asked for. I just want to make sure more people know this. It\u2019s fine to tell your kid you are proud of how smart they are - but you need to emphasize it\u2019s because of how hard they work to solve problems, and that there will always be a harder problem. Some of those problems they can solve with more work, some they might never, and that\u2019s totally okay.",

I think he learned to read playing that. He was great in all subjects. His older sister was reading chapter books by kindergarten, and could do math very easily all her life. Oldest daughter gifted in language, but not math. Your son sounds like he falls in the gifted category; one word of advice: gifted kids do great\u2026until they don\u2019t. Sometimes this isn\u2019t until college, even, but when they run into something that doesn\u2019t come \u201cnaturally\u201d or easily, they often are just stumped or stuck if they never learned to study. Since they never had to study, it\u2019s an easy skill to miss. Make sure your child is taught how to learn; they will likely need it at some point.",

Another team in full uniform, etc. showed up thinking they were scheduled to play us. Our coach said why not, it's a cool October evening so it's not like we'd overheat or anything.\n\nThey were kicking our asses, hard. I played forward and none of our other forwards could get past midfield with me, it was a slaughter. Halftime rolls around, I'm steaming sweat. My dad loved to push me growing up (within reason) and was tired of seeing us get steamrolled, so he promised me an RC Hummer if I could score a goal.\n\nI had been saving my allowance for 6 months for this $130 Hummer. It's the only toy I wanted and I would have done damn near anything for it, including scoring a goal that night.\n\nDuring the second half, any time I got the ball my dad started screaming \"Hummerrrrrrrrr!!\" The other parents eventually caught on to/learned what was happening and what was promised. I don't know how, but at some point I worked my way past their entire mid/backfield alone - my teammates were afraid to cross midfield. Dad describes it as a lone black ant wandering into the red anthill. The entire sideline was screaming \"Hummerrrr!\" Miraculously, 1v1 with the goalie, I didn't choke - I scored. All of the parents on our sideline went ballistic.\n\nFor some reason, that wasn't enough for me and I made my way down shortly after for a second 1v1 with the goalie but got stuffed.\n\nWe went to WalMart that night, my dad carrying me because I could not walk after the game from being so exhausted, and I got my damn RC Hummer.",

The teacher was a coach who was more interested in coaching than teaching and some how loaded that class with mostly members of his team aside from the handful of freshmen. We were outside in a portable classroom. Anything went, because no one was walking out behind the school to check on those portables. The team was talking about pushups one days and I said I thought I could do more than one of the sophomore guys. I was scrawny, probably 85lbs and had no idea how many pushups I could do, but I knew I could at least do some. I don't remember how it happened, but the teacher got involved. He made us get in front of class and go head to head. I just cranked out pushups until the sophomore collapsed. The sophomore got ribbed for a while. Really there just wasn't much of me to actually push up at 14. I'm in my 40s now and weigh more than twice as much. The combination of weight and age makes it a struggle now. I got to 34 when I was curious writing this comment. I'll probably be feeling it later though. Stay in shape when you're young.",

The increased mass doesnt convey linear strength gains either, so we get stronger but we also get muuuch heavier. That's why when it comes to absolute strength, its always gonna be some 400lb viking mfer, but the conversation about 'pound for pound' strongest is usually a jacked dude <245lbs who can deadlift almost 5x his weight. The bigger guys still convey more force but they also have to life an extra 200lbs of themselves to do it.",

So in absolute terms, until you get so big your bones break, etc.. you are almost always getting technically stronger, but not nearly as fast as your strength requirements have grown.

This is a basic and fundamental marketing concept.   \nConsumers have traditionally applied heavy pressure towards acquiring higher quality goods for lower prices. This market pressure has over the decades, driven our economy to lean more towards importing these goods from nations that can produce these goods for cheaper than they can be produced on shore.   \n\n\nThis economic model has been great at sustaining the consumption culture of the west, until a catastrophic global event seriously impacted the infrastructure of those countries and destabilized the market, specifically in semiconductors and transportation/logistics.   \n\n\nThis isn't something I'm just pulling out of my ass, this is well documented and is the source of many many many many campaign promises to move production back to US mainland (if you're from US) or other home country mainland, in order to become less reliant on import/export.   \n\n\nThe consumer makes their demands by choosing from the options available to them, yes, until the options available to them aren't palatable. Then they choose not to buy, and that pressure forces manufacturers and suppliers to make a change. More often than not, the change required is a reduction of prices, an increase in quality or both. The only way to achieve both, is to move manufacturing to somewhere that can produce the goods cheaper.",

And yes, it's true that there are people in that category. The **majority**, however, (measured by a percent of market share), want higher quality goods for lower prices. This isn't an opinion of mine, it's a fact of the economy and a fundamental that many marketers use in establishing a baseline price for the goods they're helping to enter the market.  \n\n\nYes, the manufacturer tries to be \"cheaper than their competitor\" but that's entirely because the consumers are creating pressure to do so. Often, a company is able to charge a higher price than their competitor if they're able to show the value that necessitates that price differential. If the **majority** of consumers suddenly decided that they would be willing to pay a higher price for domestically produced goods, then the market would shift towards producing those goods for higher prices. The reality though, is that's not the case, because the consumers are making those market demands.  \n\n\nChina specifically, does not want a war with the west because yes, they would lose a major source of their economic stability, but that hasn't been the deterrent for WW3. The deterrent against a world war is largely upheld by major trade alliances like NATO and treaties enacted and supported by the world at large since WW2. Centralizing financial/banking instruments is the largest deterrent to a world war. Sanctions are incredibly powerful in a global economy when countries need to be able to do business with other NATO countries.",

Basic story is a guy ordered a motherboard (unknowingly open box), decided he didn\u2019t need it and returned it without even opening it.  Newegg rejected the RMA because of damage.  He tried multiple times to get them to give him his money back but they refused. Forget the guys name (looks like computer Jesus) but he has a massive YouTube following.  He blasts them on his channel, they immediately try to make it right but of course the average person doesn\u2019t have that recourse.  He does a lot of digging and turns out that Newegg sent the board back to the manufacturer for repair, but decided against paying for it because of the cost.  So Newegg gets it back, knowingly damaged, and sells it as open box.  Whether it was malicious or just shitty inventory control is up for debate, but what\u2019s not is that you roll the dice on open box items since the average person has no recourse.\n\nBeyond that, Newegg has in general declined rapidly in customer service since they were bought out, but that wasn\u2019t recent.  I just ordered a few parts a week ago and they call came in perfect condition with no issue, but they were also new.",

You can find 6500 XT's and 1660 Ti's for close-ish to MSRP (like only 20-30 % extra). For other cards it goes nuts - a 3060 with an MSRP of 420 sells for 970.   \n\n\nBest Buy has a prebuilt with i5 11th gen, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD + 2 TB HDD, and RTX 3070. For 1400 $. Buying the card alone would cost close to that. Throw in another stick of RAM and maybe a bigger SSD, and it's a great machine.",

Back when I was 10, he knew I loved computer games (super nintendo emulators!) but that I only had them at his house since my parents were divorced.  He one weekend had a table full of boxes.  He simply said \"these are all the parts to make a computer, if you can get it working, you can take it home\".  He knew I loved puzzles, fixing things, gundam models, and legos.  So this was my ultimate functioning lego.  Of course this was before Google and such, he would check in with me just to look, make sure I was safe, ask me how I was doing and where I thought I was in the process, and it took me all weekend..  He made sure I didn't give up.  It made me appreciate computers far more, and actually sparked my interest in them.  Many moons later, I have my Cisco Certified Networking Associate, Security +, Bach degree (working on masters), and about 15 years of IT experience making well over $100k a year and LOVING my job.  I don't have a lot of memories with my dad that make me truly smile, but every time I pull open a computer it makes me think of him.\n\nObviously you can't bet her to build it to keep it haha, but building it together could be just as fun!  If you need any assistance send me a message!",

This guy isn't trying to get a 3000 series card for mining or even a 6600 XT for modern 1080p games.

A plain 6600 XT new starts around $550 and a used 1080 (with better overall performance) is about $480. If you don't mind going with a GTX 1650, they're actually in stock for a bit over retail at $366 which definitely makes them an easy inclusion in a mid level build while still keeping overall costs down. Each of those could be a part of a sub-$1000 build with a Ryzen 5 or an i5. Not sure where you'll get that performance with the prebuilt for the same price, but have fun fighting your straw man. \n\nWhat you're saying is a build with the same graphics card will cost more...

The idea of picking any component you want is a fallacy when they aren't actually readily available for sale.\n\nYou're ignoring market reality and behind on the times. There is no straw man here, you've just got your head in the sand.\n\nEdit: Actual prices for prebuilts are significantly lower than BYO, and the fool is the one projecting a strawman arguement below with shifting goals away from GPU arguement. Additionally, actual prebuilts, especially used, go for significantly below market price, as opposed to the prices that fool paid for.",

They can open a browser and use the bookmarks to get to their Daniel Tiger or Clifford games, watch PBS Kids videos, etc. I didn\u2019t even teach the younger one, she just picked it up from watching her sister.\n\nI learned a tremendous amount about computers as a kid just screwing around with games and stuff. Think of this as an investment in your daughter\u2019s future, she\u2019ll probably pick up skills that will serve her well later on.\n\nedit: almost forgot, my older daughter LOVED watching me assemble the PC and even \u201chelped\u201d out a little.",

(Might even be another good opportunity for a PE challenge)\n\nIf she intends to do shaders, based on [this video of a 5600g](https://youtu.be/ZAS9bNN7Bls), Sildur\u2019s shaders looks to be the best bet and you can probably lower the render distance a bit and get it to lock at 30 FPS. Otherwise, mods with no shaders will yield the best performance. \n\n(If you have a Micro Center near you, buy the CPU and motherboard there. Your wallet will thank you.

EXCEPT in the background he'd  made friends with a gym rat kid at school and he'd been exercising every day, multiple times per day and we never suspected. Apparently he waits until I'm watching TV in the evening with earphones in and my wife is asleep and does pull-up reps in the garage! So, not knowing this I said, let's knock out 20 pushups since I knew that I could do 25 or 30 if I pushed. After I turned 50 I've neglected the gym a bit....\n\nAnyway we did 25 face to face and I was getting worried but it was pretty amazing, little dude has zero body fat and has somehow become ripped! After that he asked about going to the gym and for the last two months we've been doing hour sessions with free weights 3 to 4 times per week! Kids are amazing and can push themselves physically in a way that >50 year men are not able to do without injury. Whew!",

Something like a GTX 1660 or GTX 1080 (non-Ti) ought to be less-insane options with the current market.

You don't need to pay top dollar (like Samsung) for this, as long as it's a reasonable brand. Personally, I use Sabrent. High performance but relatively low cost.\n\n16GB RAM at minimum, but aim for 32GB if you can squeeze the little bit extra because then there's a shit ton of headroom for multitasking and leaving things running in the background.\n\n6-core, 12-thread CPU at minimum. Something like a Ryzen 5 3600/Intel i5 10400 or better. Pair this with a good CPU cooler. Stock coolers usually suck and really affect performance/longevity.\n\nIf you want help with an actual whole build, you could ask in r/buildapcforme or r/buildapc",

When GPU prices drop and my kids show responsibility we might help them build their own.\n\nThe mid tier AMD GPUs might be worth a shot.  If you live near one talk to Microcenter.  Sometimes they have GPUs. \n\nVanilla Minecraft is more CPU dependent.  Once you add mods that's when your GPU does it's work.  I play Minecraft on a box with an AMD 3950x and a NVidia RTX 3090, which is grossly overkill but the only GPU I could put my hands on was a 3090.  Optifine helps my multi core processor be better than a fast processor.\n\nDo your research, check out YouTube channels (I'm sure Reddit is going to skewer me for these recommendations but....) like jayztwocents, Linus tech tips, Paul's Hardware, GamerNexus.  Often times they have \"cheap\" builds picked out you just have to put your hands on the product s.\n\nLastly, PCPartPicker.com is your friend.  Don't buy a GPU from resellers scamming you for 2k for an old 1060ti .  We are in a chip shortage, sadly patience is going to be needed unless you are like me and show up to a MicroCenter and get approval from the SO to spend over budget on the only GPU they had in stock.\n\nBest of luck and congrats to your kid doing a 4 minute plank.",

Once you start playing with shaders then the requirements shoot up rather dramatically.  If you get her a 1080p monitor then I would recommend a GTX 1060 or better along with something like a Ryzen 3600.  My daughters also love Minecraft, one has a 2700x with a 980 ti and the other has a 4790k\\* with a GTX 1650 and the 1650 really struggles with Minecraft on a 1080p monitor using shaders.  Both of those PCs are hand-me-downs from my PC over the years other than the 1650 and hopefully the release of AM5 will see that 4790 go to my son as I upgrade to that platform.\n\nAlso, a 4 minute plank is rather impressive regardless of her age.",

I felt like I could keep going forever, but I'd won already, and it was getting boring. I ended up stopping at 451, confident I'd set a world record.

I was about 12 or 13 years old, so was ashamed to go to my parents room to ask for help, so I tried sucking it up for a bit but it was too unbearable.

It varies per game what can be done with mods, could be some custom level, or in the case of minecraft it could be that you get extra custom blocks and objects that are normally not in the game or perhaps some custom gamemode. It is nothing specific, since anyone can theoretically create a mod and put it online so others can download the mod. This is also why mods generally only are available for PC games and not for console games, since there often is a painful process of downloading it from the internet and adding it to your game. Again, how painful this process is depends on both the mod and the game (some games have stuff built-in so it is easy to add mods to the game, other games don't really allow for modding at all).",

Not because women aren't smart, but because little girls are encouraged to play with dolls and toy kitchens instead of robots and arduinos.\n\nThis is a really good opportunity for her to develop passions that could blossom into really useful life skills. Encourage her in anything she wants to learn - soldering, programming, physics, chemistry... or art, or writing or music. Whatever sparks her interest. \n\nLots of kids never get that kind of encouragement from their parents, and they have to wait until college to explore and discover themselves. Letting your daughter explore the world now, while she's young and still has lots of free time, will put her leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else.\n\nEdit: Also, if you have the budget for it, definitely try to future-proof a little when you're building. Today it's minecraft, but tomorrow she could be learning Python, GIMP, Blender or CAD. Having the resources to explore powerful software will serve her well in the long run.",

      "text": "Hi there! I\u2019m a professional Minecraft builder & content creator (yes, it\u2019s a real thing) that focuses on realistic city designs and the technical side of building design. I\u2019m also nearly finished an architectural engineering degree and am planning to apply to graduate architecture masters programs within the next year. Minecraft is actually the reason I am where I am today! \n\nI\u2019m not a parent, nor do I intent to tell you how to parent, but one thing I wish my parents did more often growing up was ask me about my Minecraft creations. I love showing them off and explaining my process! If she really loves building, there is a strong possibility that it will develop into a love of architecture and it could potentially be a career for her. If you encourage her & ask some questions about the build, her creativity will soar.\n\nI\u2019ll add some great questions to ask her below, these questions are intended to help her mind follow her thought process back to the inspiration source, which will REALLY help her improve. I know from experience :)\n\nSome questions as she\u2019s showing you her builds:\n1. \u201cWhat was your inspiration for the build?\u201d (Name of a real life building, something she saw, etc)\n2. If you see a part of the build that looks interesting, make sure to ask WHY she did it that way\n3. Ask what her plans are for either continuing the build or for new builds! I personally can\u2019t stop talking when someone asks me about it, I just love it :)\n\n\nIf she\u2019s playing on Java edition, she will likely start to use texturepacks when she feels her skills have hit a certain level. These packs (especially the good ones specifically designed for building) typically require a higher graphics capability. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve bought anything yet, but I\u2019d recommend at least a 1070 GPU with 8 to 16 GB of ram (8 should be fine for what she\u2019s doing). You can get away with a lower end graphics card, but a 1070 should last a solid 5 years for what she needs it for. \n\nAlso once she gets Java edition, there\u2019s a texturepack specifically designed for semi-realistic cities & buildings called \u201cCubedPack\u201d. A good friend of mine created the pack and I\u2019ve used it for about 5 years now. If you do end up wanting to use it feel free to send me a DM on Reddit, you\u2019ll need another mod called \u201cOptifine\u201d for version 1.14.4 for it to properly work. I\u2019d be more than happy to help you get it set up, it can be a little confusing if you aren\u2019t familiar with the file aspect of Minecraft.\n\nHappy building!\n\nEdit: You should also get her to explore on Google Maps, you can turn on the satellite terrain and also the 3D buildings if you put it in \u201cglobe view\u201d. I can explore for HOURS on end through the entire world. She can also use \u201cstreet view\u201d that is built into Google maps so she can see everything from eye-level. This helps develop her \u201cintroverted intuition\u201d, her mind will subconsciously put together patterns and will help her become much better!",

Heavy mod lists can require upwards of 8 GiB and you\u2019ll want at least double that so the OS and other things don\u2019t choke when MC tries to use 8 GiB.\n\nFor a CPU you\u2019ll want something with good single core performance. Both Intel and AMD will work fine here. I think Intel will have slightly higher single core performance than AMD (w/ AMD having better multi-core), though not sure how big of a difference it would make here. Just use your discretion here.\n\nNow, the GPU. Anything 10-series or higher should do just fine, as MC isn\u2019t a GPU intensive game. The real challenge here would be finding any modern GPU at a good price. Probably will not be buying new unless you are willing to pay well above MSRP, and figure out the pattern for when stores restock and camp the add to cart button.\n\nHold off on buying any parts until you can secure a GPU. This way if this proves too much of a challenge, then you can fallback to buying a custom built from a reputable brand.",

People allow kids to get their way all the time and those very same kids are gonna grow up thinking \"I can get what I want whenever I want\" and it's disgusting. All I could ever ask for as a kid was animal toys, plushies, and dinosaur books. I didn't grow up on video games like everybody else did, I never asked for PC games, never asked for a dirt bike, or any of that shit. I grew up happy with the simpler toys and stuff. Kids today are so fuckin spoiled. \n\nNow I understand if a kid is asking for something that they don't have like say their own tv or something. But I would make sure they're doing well in school and that they're actually behaving. They demand something of me straight up, I'll tell them \"Try asking me next year.\" Kids shouldn't be brought up thinking they can get whatever they want just because they're kids. They need to earn the items and gotta wait for them once the parents can afford it. That's how it should be.",

Some just ran Minecraft servers in their early teens, some went on to learn other programming languages and have jobs as regular programmers. All stemming from what they learned from their hobby. \n\nOne such part of that path is mods. What happens when a mod you download is almost perfect, or has a bug and no more support? You learn to edit mods. This almost always leads to learning a scripting language, 3D modeling, animation, or some other such trade skill. \n\nI can\u2019t even list the number of modders that either got hired by the company of the game they made mods for, or started a company themselves.",

What if your PSU malfunctions and fries every component on your desktop and you are left with just the computer case?  \n\n\nFor a kid - the portability of a laptop is great and it doesn't take a lot of space, it can easily be turned off and placed away.

Depending on his local market and what he is able to buy - he might or might not be able to get something of good value. The thing is, its a huge struggle getting your money's worth with desktops nowadays. With laptops - not so much. They aren't really all that affected by the price hikes. They are, but an insignificant amount when compared to desktop parts. For all i know, ZEN based APUs are great for gaming on a budget, but 30fps 720p isn't a target moat people aim for. Heck, raspberry pi is a desktop pc if you look at it with the right mindset, but I wouldn't recommend it as a gaming PC. A raspberry pi will run minecraft with 30+avgfps with the right settings.",

You are not contributing to the discussion much and you haven't commented on my points. You are just forcing your opinion (dang, i must be on reddit). Laptops have a number of advantages over desktops and vice-versa. Desktops being better in some ways does not in any way diminish the fact that laptops are cheaper in today's market and the fact that laptops have other benefits. Your points, while valid, are irrelevant. A ton of tech and non-tech people use laptops, be it professionals or youtubers or enthusiasts, so arguing that laptops are not a choice to be considered is dense. My comparison examples are just examples, you don't need them for minecraft, but minecraft with shaders and mods might not run smoothly on that configuration either.

Shaders change things graphics wise, but I never run them so couldn\u2019t tell you there what you need!\n\nBut honestly, modded minecraft is great in a lot of ways.

      "text": "So I buy computers for a living and I\u2019m more than happy to send you some options. I actually just built a budget computer for my niece who wanted to play Minecraft on a PC instead of her iPad, and she loves it. Given the popularity of this post, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got a full inbox, but I would love to send you some budget friendly choices. Now is actually a great time to buy a computer. Since 12th GEN processors are releasing, manufacturers are desperate to dump their 10th GEN and 11th GEN laptops and desktops. Laptops are especially about to drop hugely in price so that may end up being a better deal. I will send you some information. If you have a goal budget, that helps!\n\nEDIT: Looks like you're in AUS and I'm in USA so I'm not sure what your options are, but I can still provide some recommendations on what deals to look for. These recommendations are bottom of the line gaming choices in today's market, but they're good enough that they'll last you a few years. I've been working with an i7-8750H + GTX 1060 laptop since its release, and it's still working great.\n\nSo, I would recommend a GTX 1650 with 8GB DDR4 RAM and either intel i5 (9th, 10th, or 11th gen) or Ryzen 5 (4000 or 5000 series).\n\nIf you want to go for a good budget desktop, you should be able to find a good deal for a GTX 1650 + either i5 or Ryzen 5. I see some new models from HP in the $600-$700 USD range for that spec, and you may be able to find a used one for less. I know other people are telling you to get a 1080, but that's more powerful than you need for a kid's PC. The recommended spec is way lower. Others are suggesting building a PC yourself, but it can be hard to find a good deal on a standalone GPU right now.\n\nFor a laptop - There are a number of laptops with GTX 1650 and i5 or i7 10th gen available in the $650 - $800 USD range, some MSI, some HP, and a few ASUS and Dell. \n\nIf you want something for less than $600 USD, you may be able to find a good used deal or build from refurbished parts for less. For my niece, we were able to pull it together cheaply because my boyfriend had recently decided to upgrade to a new CPU and GPU, so we had older parts on hand. You can perhaps check around with some of your tech savvy friends and see if they have any parts on hand that they aren't using, which they may gift you or sell you cheaply. It's sort of a thing with people in the tech world. They find bits and pieces that \"might be useful later\" and hang onto them waiting for a project like yours. My boyfriend tells me that Raspberry Pi could be a great inexpensive option, and it's a good learning opportunity as well. The Raspberry Pi 400 is real cheap and will play minecraft. I personally find them a bit frustrating, but my boyfriend loves tinkering with them.",

      "text": "Thats awesome congrats for your daughter! Here is my 2 cents on the computer, just like everyone though, just an opinion on semi future proof gaming rig.\n\nI would go to your local microcenter and piece the computer together with her, it would be some much fun, I bet she would have a blast to see the parts she's picking out. \n\nA lower end graphics card will do just fine for something like this. I would pick up a [6600](https://www.microcenter.com/product/643582/msi-amd-radeon-rx-6600-mech-2x-dual-fan-8gb-gddr6-pcie-40-graphics-card), [6600 XT](https://www.microcenter.com/product/640366/powercolor-amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-fighter-dual-fan-8gb-gddr6-pcie-40-graphics-card), or even a [1660 Super](https://www.microcenter.com/product/616156/msi-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-super-ventus-xs-overclocked-dual-fan-6gb-gddr6-pcie-30-graphics-card). These are all sub $500 and best bang for the buck right now. Unfortunately this isn't a great time to buy a graphics card but prices are slowing coming down so thats a good thing. \n\nFor the rest of the rig, I would personally go AMD route, [This Ryzen 5 5600x](https://www.microcenter.com/product/616156/msi-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-super-ventus-xs-overclocked-dual-fan-6gb-gddr6-pcie-30-graphics-card) is a good starting price IMO, if you wanted to future proof a little bit more you could go [Ryzen 7 5800X 8 Core](https://www.microcenter.com/product/630284/amd-ryzen-7-5800x-vermeer-38ghz-8-core-am4-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included), which is on sale right now for over $100 less. The Ryzen 7 doesnt have heat sink, so make sure to pick up a cheap one. \n\nMotherboards look like they have taken off in price recently. There are usually a bunch of options under the $100 mark, but looks like the selection is dwindling. [MSI B450M](https://www.microcenter.com/product/613835/msi-b450m-pro-m2-max-amd-microatx-am4-motherboard) isn't a bad little board, only the cheaper side but should work. This is where I might got for a more expensive option like [this B550 board from ASRock](https://www.microcenter.com/product/625300/asrock-b550-pro4-amd-am4-atx-motherboard) Couple more slots for expandability, more m.2 slots as well. \n\nOther users were saying 8 gb of ram. Just dont lol. 8gb is no longer good enough IMO. Even 16gb is pushing it nowadays. Just get 16 and call it a day. [16GB RGB FTW lo](https://www.microcenter.com/product/611303/corsair-vengeance-rgb-pro-16gb-(2-x-8gb)-ddr4-3200-pc4-25600-cl16-dual-channel-desktop-memory-kit-cmw16gx4m2e3200c16-black)l \n\nFor a boot drive, grab a lower storage M.2 NvME drive, 250 gb or so. Something like this [Samsung 980](https://www.microcenter.com/product/633659/samsung-980-ssd-250gb-m2-nvme-interface-pcie-30-x4-internal-solid-state-drive-with-v-nand-3-bit-mlc-technology-(mz-v8v250b-am)) to just load windows and a couple programs. Then you can grab a larger capacity 2.5\" SSD [Like this one.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/615041/crucial-bx500-1tb-ssd-3d-nand-sata-iii-6gb-s-25-internal-solid-state-drive)  Or you can just buy a larger M.2 drive from the get go, they are not unreasonably priced I dont think. [$140 for Inland M.2 1tb is a decent price](https://www.microcenter.com/product/642169/inland-performance-plus-1tb-3d-tlc-nand-pcie-gen-4-x4-nvme-m2-internal-ssd). I personally like to have 2 seperate drive, just in case ya know. \n\nToss in a white case with some pre installed RGB fans, something like [Something Like this Lian Li](https://www.microcenter.com/product/638103/lian-li-lancool-205-mesh-mid-tower-chassis-atx-computer-case-pc-gaming-case-w-tempered-glass-side-panel,-magnetic-dust-filter,-water-cooling-ready,-si), and it would look sweet!.\n\nCheap power supply like [This EVGA 650](https://www.microcenter.com/product/465460/evga-650bq-650-watt-80-plus-bronze-atx-semi-modular-power-supply) would be more than enough power for this rig. \n\nAll in all this wouldn't be a bad little gaming rig. Looking like right around $1300 +/-   Can prolly get that closer to 1100 if you go cheaper SSD, Cheaper motherboard, maybe save $50 or so bucks going with the 1660 over the 6600 like I chose.  (this doesnt include mouse/keyboard/monitor and or windows FYI)",

That all adds up $$ big time. \n\nSo I'd strongly consider going with a gaming laptop, actually. All in one package, but you'll still need to get a mouse separately. The performance of mobile chipsets these days are absurdly impressive at handling 1080p gaming, and your kid is playing Minecraft, you don't need a powerhouse to run that game anyway. Plus the portability that comes with a laptop is awesome. And they're very easy to hook up to a TV and controller if you want a more console-like experience at will. \n\n[Something like this for less than $800](https://www.newegg.com/aluminum-black-msi-gf-series-gf75-thin-10scsr-641-gaming-entertainment/p/N82E16834155802) is more than enough to handle Minecraft and some. \n\nThat said, I won't deny that building a computer is a fun experience. I built plenty of computers back in the day and as other commentators have noted, it would probably be a great experience for your daughter. As far as user experience goes, for me, laptop wins over desktop every day of the week, unless you're looking to do 4k gaming (which you aren't).",

[Dell Optiplex 9020](https://www.ebay.com/itm/275167867576?hash=item40114872b8:g:MdwAAOSwzHNiCqHQ) \\- $170, this is your base computer.  It'll run minecraft ok stock.  You could upgrade the ram if you want but it's not necessary\n\n2. [870 EVO SSD](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-500GB-Internal-MZ-77E500B-AM/dp/B08QBMD6P4/ref=sr_1_5) \\- $70, just a basic high quality SSD\n\n3. [Windows 7 Pro COA](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2047675.m570.l1312&_nkw=windows+7+pro+coa&_sacat=0) \\- \\~$15, this is the software license for windows, which can be used to install Windows 10 Pro (if you can't find a single sticker, message me, I have like 10 lying around, you can have one for free)\n\nSo for $250 you could have a basic minecraft computer.  Now... if you want to ball out add the following:\n\n4. [500W power supply](https://www.amazon.com/Thermaltake-Certified-Continuous-cooling-PS-SPD-0500NPCWUS-W/dp/B014W3EM2W/ref=sr_1_3) \\- $40, this will give you the juice to run a graphics card\n\n5. [24 to 8 pin power rail](https://www.amazon.com/Must-Have-Gadgets-Optiplex-Precision/dp/B01G84VCMG/ref=sr_1_2) \\- $10, this is required to make the power supply compatible with this generation of Dell Optiplex\n\n6. [ASUS Dual GTX 1070](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=asus+dual+gtx+1070&_sacat=0&LH_TitleDesc=0&_odkw=gtx+1070+dual&_osacat=0) \\- $300-400, I know for a fact that this card will fit in the optiplex, but any of the shorter 2 fan 1070's should do the trick.  Maybe lookup some specs and compare the overall length of the card to this one, that's the limiting factor.  The card can run into the hard drive bay otherwise\n\nI've built the above setup several times for myself and friends.  Believe it or not, this is actually VR ready.  It will run beatsaber and super hot with an oculus rift. You could also shoot for a smaller card to save a little money like a 1060 or 1050 ti.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.  Whatever you decide to do I hope this spawns a wonderful technical relationship with your daughter.",

For reference I use an Intel i5-6500 with 8 GB of RAM and this runs a pretty crazy technical world at up to 300 fps and normally around 180 fps. I never really used mods tho, i know they decrease performance but idk by how much so if you're gonna use several demanding mods at once you might need to go higher on the CPU.

I'm in no position to recommend PC parts, but as a former rock climbing instructor I can say that you should never underestimate little girls. They **will** go full beast mode at the drop of a hat.\n\nWhen I worked at my climbing gym, I would sometimes manage birthday parties for kids. The boys would always be like \"oh man I'm gonna climb everything\" and the girls were usually a little apprehensive of the heights.\n\nWell, the boys would very often get halfway up and beg to be let back down. Not so with many of the girls; they were constantly zipping up the walls like monkeys. \n\nMoreover, any competition climber will tell you that among all the buff dudes doing hard climbs there's always at least one little girl doing all the same hard stuff just as well.",

      "text": "Damn what an awesome bet hahaha, I'm not really into fitness but the PC part caught my attention.  Rn buying the PC has a major problem as graphics cards are out of stock or excessively priced to a point where it doesn't make sense.  However if your daughter is looking to play Minecraft with shaders for either java or bedrock I'd strongly recommend using a Nvidia gpu.  This is because Minecraft java edition uses OpenGL rendering which is the graphics library that runs better on Nvidia gpus.  Amd instead is much better at running Opencl games but this is not often used with OpenGL being more popular.  Using a Nvidia card would also allow her in the future to get into blender modelling if it becomes an interest as it too has a software advantage as blender dropped support for Opencl.\n\nAs a general guide you'd be aiming for an Intel core i5 or ryzen 5. This should be enough for some lightweight gaming for a kid but there's no real reason for going with an Intel core i7 or ryzen 7 as the extra headroom will most likely not be used.\nFor ram I'd aim for 16gb, 8gb has become the minimum to run Windows with Google and 32gb being a bit much for gaming.  16gb has been the sweet spot \n\nMotherboard is making sure it's compatible and has enough features for what you need it to do. No need for a $300 mobo if a $120 one can do the same thing.\n\nPower supplies are usually as simple as making sure it has a good power efficiency which saves money on electricity cost, making sure it has enough wattage with some headroom and making sure it's from a reputable manufacturer.\n\nThese are just a few of the parts ik I didn't talk about the case, car fans, storage etc.\n\nThere is also the option of buying a prebuilt which will hopefully have all the above figured out but you have to make sure to see how much each parts MSRP is and what the total system is being sold as to gauge how much is being spent on building it.\n\nAnother but far fetched idea is maybe looking into gaming laptops?  The performance will be lower than the desktop price equivalent however it already comes with a screen and keyboard so you save money in that aspect.  It also allows it to be portable so you can always move it around easily, for example doing hw at the dinner table and see what's happening.  Do note though that after a few years battery life will degrade and it will become like a portable desktop where it always has to be plugged in.\n\nIf you want some help with picking stuff up for a PC there are quite a few good subreddits to ask.  Finding a gpu will be a challenge but using integrated graphics could be an option until you find something.  It may not be able to run shaders but it should be able to run Minecraft with optimization mods like sodium or optifine at an acceptable level.\n\nHope this helps",

It was a \"hand me down\" from work, so with that $150 GPU (I know, right? It was $80 MSRP when it came out!!), my son has a fully functional PC that can run a fairly wide selection of games.\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure that a \"current gen\" CPU with integrated graphics would wipe the floor with that system. Don't fret over specs too much. As long as you've got a (close to) current gen CPU (>= I3), and 8-16GB of RAM...any GPU with GDDR5 memory (think 1050 or better) will probably get you 60+ FPS with mods and shaders.\n\nYou'll be fine.

My parents found out because I was staying at a family friend's house and they showed up there and caught me.\n\nMy parents said I was grounded for a month and I was resigned to it. That first weekend rolled around though, 5 days into my grounding. The first Saturday of it. I asked my Dad what I could do instead of being grounded. He sarcastically said, \"install that pond/fountain your mom bought\"... There was a reason my dad had put off doing this for months. It was about 3'x4' and about 2' deep. I would have to clear the weeds from the area, dig the hole (it's all clay and rock here) and then run and hook up all the plumbing. But, I was desperate and accepted the challenge. About an hour into it, my friends called to hang out, I told em I was still grounded for a month or until I finished this Pond/fountain.\n\nWithin 30 minutes 5 guys with 5 shovels showed up and we had that fountain done in about 90 minutes. My Dad was shocked and my mom was happy to have her fountain but mad that my dad made that deal and I was off to have fun",

      "text": "I would say your best bet would be a prebuild desktop as Graphics Cards have been over-priced for the last couple of years. Though, even then it's a good chunk of the overall price. If you're looking for a way to get a prebuild, but also have a semi DIY experience something like [this](https://nzxt.com/product/bld-kit-starter-pro-pc) from NZXT would be a good way to go. \n\nA 3060 Ti comes in the DiY kit and it should be able to handle shaders and even a few other mods for Minecraft. I check out some videos maybe from Gamer Nexus on Youtube as he does have quite a few videos where he looks at prebuilt PC from different SI. I got lucky to snag a RTX 3060 Ti in Newegg shuffle, but wasn't expecting to actually be selected. Just enter for the fun of it. \n\nIf you can find a decent prebuilt(for a decent price) with a RTX 3060 or higher it should easily be able to do everything you mention above. I run a Mod on HBS Battletech and due to how poorly the game was optimized even high end computer can stutter with Roguetech Mod. I have a Ryzen 7 2700X paired with a RTX 3060 and a Intel I5-11600K paired with a 3060 Ti and both systems handle my mods just fine enough for me. \n\nAnyway, I hope you find something that fits your price point for your daughter. Look around and as always in doubt about a prebuild see if anyone has done a review of it on Youtube.",

You need a decent CPU and enough RAM (I'd say at least 16 GB) to handle mods and mod packs running simultaneously, that's it.

Both of these do not necessarily need an aftermarket cooler if your system has good airflow. Though then you will likely need another fan or two. I recommend Noctua in that situation.\n\nAs for the GPU: Try to get a 3060ti if you can. Otherwise a 1660/ti will scrape by with Minecraft + some shaders. The 3060ti will future proof you much better though.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions! Also, don't trust the prices on pcpartpicker. Sourcing yourself would be better and more accurate by a magnitude.\n\nThere are also decent prebuilts out there. I won't list them for sake of sheer length of post.

AMD gives you loads of cores which is good for proffesional work stations, it's good for doing grunt work or having loads of things running at once. Intel's are good at doing 1 thing, but doing that 1 thing very well. Minecraft for example relies on something that's called single core performance. This means that the developers of minecraft did a bad job of using multiple cores of a cpu. So the Intel really shines when games are badly developed/optimized (most games are). Where as AMD might do well in a game where the developers have invested time into utilizing the cores of a processor. Right now Intel isn't just masssively ahead in terms of performance for single core, but it's even ahead in multi-threaded (multi-core) processes. So it beats AMD on both fronts for the time being. Intels are also much cheaper than AMDs at the moment at every price bracket. However the rhetoric and the bias for AMD on reddit and all over youtube would lead you to believe the opposite. Trust me they are wrong, especially for minecraft java version.",

You can worry about a finding a real GPU later.

Make sure that your kid understands how important that is and that could be a good teaching bonding moment in its own right. \n\n I bought a 250dollar used pc when I was 12 to play Minecraft. I suggest you look at the same kinda thing with the used pcs because at the end of the day you arnt gonna have her playing gta v or doom or anything crazy so go with just enough specs to run the game fine. \n\nFinally, I have a higher end pc (1400 build before Covid prices) I still can\u2019t run Minecraft at max settings without frame drops unless I install optifine. If you build a pc capable of running absloutly everything the game and its mods offer then expect to spend well over 2k but then again a 600 dollar computer is gonna run most everything just fine at lower settings.",

I made a bet with my 6 year daughters (twins) that if they did the Mutton Bustin' contest (sheep riding at the state fair) that I would buy them each the LEGO set they had been saving for (\\~$120 each). They were still a little hesitant. I said, \"Okay, if you can WIN the competition, I'll buy you the LEGO Disney Castle.\" It's \\~$400 USD. But I knew they'd never win and I just wanted them to try. They have to hold on for at least 6 seconds to be considered a \"win\" and then whoever is on the longest is the winner. Usually about 15-20 kids sign up for each time slot (about every 3 hours).\n\nFirst daughter goes at 11am slot and her sheep gets released from the gate and she makes it about halfway across the ring before sliding off the side. Stayed on for maybe max of 3 seconds. She was excited she did it but bummed she fell off. Excited again when I told her I'd buy her the LEGO set she wanted since she tried it.\n\nSecond daughter is more hesitant after watching her sister. Decides last minute to do the 1pm time slot. She's got a determined look on her face as she's standing on the gate to get set onto her sheep. Gate opens and she rides the sheep ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE RING and then some! Finally just STEPS OFF the sheep like she's getting off her bicycle (every other kid got tossed or slide off the side). She won the whole thing and got invited for an exhibition at the rodeo that night with the winners from the other time slots.\n\nIronically, when we went to LEGOLAND for their birthday, she didn't actually want the DISNEY castle and was more excited for the smaller LEGO set she'd been saving for. Saved me almost $300!",

I think in this case Intel is better than AMD because Minecraft likes a high core clock. Make sure to get at least 16 gigs of ram and an ssd as well. I\u2019m not the most experienced at the moment with PC parts as I\u2019m kinda out of the loop, but I also don\u2019t think you need the newest, most expensive parts for Minecraft.

Football staff were hard to recruit him. \n\nTold him if he could get honor roll and a couple other small objectives that were attainable but would take work he could go to football. \n\nYeah, he did them. Put more points on the board and took the team to their first playoff game in three decades (no kickers means a lot of 4th down conversions and two point conversions instead of nearly guaranteed field goals and extra points). \n\nNext season tore his ACL and cracked a wrist bone early in the season scrambling a botched punt. Came back for soccer, sprained his ankle, came back from that, finished the season. \n\nGoes to college to be a kicker. Finds out after summer and just before season he tore ACL but happened during soccer season. \n\nNo more soccer or football now and college didn't work out. Works in a warehouse full time and is happy. We throw disc golf competitively together now.",

Tell her since she made it she WILL get a PC on her Birthday (or any other special day that comes in not too far future) IF she can show you that she can deal with times that YOU and your wife set, you will buy the PC but it won't belong to her but you and you as her parents decide if she's allowed to play with it. \n3.

I guess that there are rules for all the other stuff that she uses, why not for this one?\nAnd btw a PC is expensive, especially these days (pandemic again), I don't think that OP has like 1-1.5k laying around somewhere just to be spend on a PC, that's another reason why to wait to buy the computer. It's a very big deal for the kid so it's pure parenting to take care of the mediaconsume and to get sure that the kid can handle the situation,which would be possible if they'd set what they expect from her behaviourwise before they buy it for her.",

I\u2019d honestly buy her a nice laptop that she\u2019ll be able to use for schoolwork in high school too, it\u2019ll be a bigger investment but considering how powerful computers are getting they\u2019re fairly future proof and a good laptop can certainly run Minecraft\n\nA 1000 dollar economy pc rig that only plays Minecraft and is a much worse investment than a 2000 dollar MacBook that will be brought to school and used for assignments eventually\n\nJust make sure to get a mouse with it because trackpads are horrific for playing Minecraft\n\nI obviously am not suggesting that most laptops are good gaming computers but considering that you\u2019re trying to run Minecraft at minimum 30fps and not tomb-raider at 120 fps you\u2019ll be fine",
