  "text": "TIFU by asking for some hardcore bdsm from my boyfriend. And now I think I\u2019m mentally scarred.\nI am in no way shape or form blaming my bf, but I think I mentally scarred myself. I\u2019ve been watching some pretty crazy shit recently, and I had the smart idea to try something out. I asked him if he could preform certain acts of BDSM with my consent. I wasn\u2019t abused as a kid or anything. Idk, porn just glorified it enough to make me curious. We had safe words and everything. And when we did the deed, I was\u2026 conflicted to say the least. It was arousing, don\u2019t get me wrong. But fuck, it also left me feeling helpless. I know it was kind of the point, but I was not prepared. I didn\u2019t ask to stop because I was still getting off on it.\n\nMy bf was very against it at first since he was as vanilla as a person can be. but he said if I really wanted to try, he\u2019d be up for it. The thing was, he actually enjoyed it. Like really enjoyed it. \n\nAnyways afterwards, I let him know that it wasn\u2019t as fun as I\u2019d thought it would be and that we wouldn\u2019t do it again. He was understanding of course. But for some reason, I was kind of unnerved that he was really into it. And the weeks afterwards, I just kept thinking of how helpless. I\u2019ve been less intimate with my boyfriend since then. Every time he touches me to initiate, I recoil. And every time I think of being intimate with him, I think of that night.\n\nMy boyfriend has been very supportive with me, saying it\u2019s no big deal if we weren\u2019t intimate. Just as long as I feel comfortable. The thing is, I\u2019m not. He doesn\u2019t know that this has been festering inside me and I actually feel like shit for feeling like this. It seems totally unfair to tell him about this because, like I literally asked for bdsm specifically! He\u2019d feel like a total piece of shit for doing what I asked. It\u2019s not his fault I woke some kink in him. \n\nAnyways, I think I\u2019m gonna spend money on therapy to fix this myself, thanks for listening Reddit\n\nTLDR: Asked my bf to be very rough with me during sex. It mentally scarred me and I feel like shit for feeling like shit. Can\u2019t tell my bf because it\u2019ll make him feel like shit because I\u2019m a piece of shit for thinking it would be hot. So I\u2019m going to therapy.\n\nEdit: Hi! Shit. Didn\u2019t expect this to blow up as big as it did. There is no way I\u2019ll be able to read every comment, but I want to thank all of you! Even the \u201cquestionable\u201d comments for the laughs. I just want to reiterate that I don\u2019t blame my boyfriend at all. In fact I\u2019m going to just up and tell him my feelings and apologize for being somewhat cold these last few weeks. We\u2019re generally pretty good about communicating since we\u2019ve been together for years. But idk, there\u2019s something deeply personal about opening up about this. Like I know it\u2019s hypocritical to be upset. But I can\u2019t just turn off my anxiety. And I know he\u2019s anxious about it too, but doesn\u2019t want to open up either in fear of hurting my feelings too. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll just rip off the band aid. Anyways thanks again Reddit! And also sorting by controversial gave me some good laughs just from the insanity of a certain group of people lmao. I hope you guys find someone that loves you.\n\nEdit 2: I let him in on the inner workings of my mind the other day. I made it very clear that I am not voluntarily trying to hold it against it. Rather it the result of some trauma that I brought upon myself for my lack of preparation. I apologized for being relatively cold for the last weeks, and we made it. He knew something was up and felt really bad, and I reassured it it was all on me. I showed him the Reddit post just for transparency. Anyways, we\u2019re both gonna go to therapy to deal with any trauma induced symptoms. Because that\u2019s what it is, symptoms that I want to get treated. It isn\u2019t me, nor do I want to be dictated by it. Anyways, have a lovely day peeps! And to all the people at the top of controversial sort, I mean it. I hope you find someone that will love you \u2764\ufe0f",

No fucking way. Big difference between taking control and causing damage. Little nap and a bruise on the neck is not comparable.\n\nPs you should if you're into being choked by your man, get him to do jiu jitsu. You get quite good at knowing the point of unconsciousness and squeeze control. I'm sort of at the point where I can gradually increase basically edging them with the choke until they are right on the edge, darkness encroaching right as they are cumming but not put them unconscious.

Wait for them to adjust thinking they don\u2019t have it and then you get to breath. A girl might start coughing if she\u2019s not used to being choked\u2014 or strangled or whatever. I know the actual blood choke is the goal\u2014 just not sure how much training they\u2019re doing just to apply a choke during sex. With that too you gotta trust the girl. Trevor Bauer essentially did this and either didn\u2019t realize she was out, or did and decided to put her legs up...  but yeah\u2014 it can get iffy when a girl says she wants something and then the reality is more than she expected.",

So I had to take a lot of breaks during 'being a dom' in the bedroom, talk for a bit, get some enthusiastic verbal approval, maybe some kisses/cuddles for me and the like before putting the ball gag back in and returning from it.\n\nIf there was ever a time she got frustrated with me for breaking character, losing tempo or changing the mood, she never once communicated it to me as a bad thing.  She was also very willing to have a lengthy judgemental free conversation about all of it outside of the bedroom.  If there was something she wanted to try that I didn't feel comfortable with because of my vanilla nature, we'd talk it out to see if there was a compromise or she'd respect those boundaries.\n\nI'd say anyone trying it on either side, tying someone up, or being tied up or delving into the area of consensual non-consent role play, take frequent breaks.  Break character, talk out your feelings, what is working and not working.  Toss in some vanilla stuff.  After a bit of practice you can incorporate including enthusiastic verbal consent _during_ your role playing without breaking character in the form of dirty talk.  Still, even after you've been doing it for a bit, I would encourage folks to break character.",

                              "text": "Yup!  There are common pitfalls to kinky sex, like dom or sub drop (depression after caused by intense feelings of shame, guilt and worthlessness) that can be avoided by solidily differentiating fantasy from reality.  Normalizing verbal communication during sex (and breaks) helps with that.\n\nIt may seem counter intuitive because changing the mood, tempo and rhythm can often make it more difficult for a lot of women to cum during vanilla sex, sometimes it can mean sex is over for the night.  But imo that's just because peeps are doing foreplay wrong.  Good foreplay doesn't start in the bedroom, you start it there and you are a day late.  Tease, flirt, romance each other throughout the day/week.  Good foreplay does _not_ end at penetration either.  With very few people does sex need to be a linear crescendo to orgasm.  Taking a break and just holding each other while kissing is not the end.\n\nThe same principles of good kinky sex, IMO, apply to_all_ sex.  Everyone of every gender tends to have their deepest insecurities tied to sex.  Making the relationship environment one where peeps feel safe, trusted, respected, desired, accepted, loved and cared for makes _sex better_.  Making it one where peeps can talk about things sans judgement and with confidence makes sex better.  Shoot those same principles apply to good group sex too.\n\nThe point is, if you wanted to build a good sex dungeon, you need to first lay a good sex foundation.  Without strong supports, what will you hang the sex swings from?  Without a solid base, what will you anchor the chain rings into for leg restraints?",

I think it\u2019s natural that most people enjoy pleasing their partners and that in and of itself wouldn\u2019t fall into a bdsm category. That would be like saying if your partner requested some sort of activity and you agree to it makes you a sub, definitely not the case. \n\nPleasure doms are still doms. This is by no means an all encompassing, highly accurate definition but the simplest way to think about it might be that a pleasure dom is likely to \u201cpunish\u201d their sub with pleasure. Instead of paddling you or tying you up and edging you, I\u2019m much more likely to make you cum 5, 10, 15 times before you\u2019re allowed to touch me.\n\nI know in the last 5-10 or so years bdsm has gotten \u201cmainstream\u201d and I\u2019m by no means gate keeping the community, it\u2019s just that everyone doesn\u2019t need a bdsm label. Wanting your partner to enjoy themselves and being aroused by their enjoyment by itself doesnt make you a pleasure dom or a service top or any other thing besides a good partner.",

We haven't had regular sex in over 2 years due to *her* obvious pain when we do the deed caused by her general pain issues and at that time she had been less active because of her pain and depressed and that had led to a large amount of weight gain. The weight gain led to more pain, which led to more depression. I also have pain issues that make it difficult to perform, but I was willing to push through as long as she was having a good time. Problem is, the bigger she got the more pain she had to the point any type of penetration at all made her grimace in pain. I fucking hate that look on her face with the knowledge she thinks she's enduring the pain for me to get off and it's actually a turn off. Side note: I always made sure she got off at least 2-3 times minimum before initiating intercourse and at the beginning of our relationship we would both cum the last time together at least 75% of the time. \n\nWhen it got to the point neither of us was happy and we were both actually in pretty severe pain and not remotely satisfied afterwards I told her we don't need to try anymore until something changes. We still get each other off in other ways, just not PiV anymore. This has made her think I don't love her and it's been a challenge with her previous mental health issues. I'm now at the point where I'd like to start trying to bring intercourse back into our relationship but now every time I want to or she's acting like she does there are timing issues, different pain issues, the 5 year old decides that's the night he's going to wake up 100 times to ask for a drink or snack, etc. \n\nIt sucks right now, but I know it will get better. We've both been doing what we can to alleviate our pain issues as much as possible and both lost weight. She's very proud of that and I tell her I'm proud of her when she brings it up. Hopefully one of these days she will see that I just want us to both be healthy and happy instead of in constant pain to the point of not being able to have a normal sex life.... Fuck, just realized how much I just typed. Sorry for the text wall.",

Even if we don't get any medical intervention that can reduce or remove the pain, even a non-addictive pain med would be great. I suffer through back pain at work until it gets to the point of absolutely HAVING to take narcotics because I couldn't perform my job anymore without the help. Besides my GF I know at least 4 or 5 other chronic pain sufferers who are also going to a \"pain management\" Dr. whose only job seems to be prescribing stronger and stronger narcotics for people to get hooked on. It sickens me that they would just prescribe shitty addictive meds to treat the pain but not try to diagnose the underlying cause because \"Insurance won't cover those tests until you do PT. Oh, can't make it through PT because it causes you too much pain? No MRI for you then!\".",

It's been a real struggle because even though I hate to be tied down by my drugs I'm terrified what life would be with out them and how my quality of life could sink and disappear and I've told my dr I won't go back to being bed bound. We were actively decreasing for a while while I was at ok spot and managing and that was rough. I had been doing lidocaine ketamine infusions every 8 weeks and they were _massively_ helpful, reducing my pain by half for around 5 weeks. The government stopped covering them last year in April and I had to drop from 3 hour  infusions to 1 hour, managed to get that to a good spot and then my clinic just shut in January out of no where and with out warning. It's been super rough. They're opening up again but want $750 for a 1hr infusion when it was previously $60. It's insane. But I would still massively recommend them if yiu have access and th4 budget!",

Sometimes the person who wants the fantasy so bad, thinks that they'll be the ones with all the power, enjoyment and they learn a lot of conflicting things about themselves and it shakes them to their core and they can't get over it. \n\nUnfortunately, she hasn't addressed anything her partner could do or what she'd like to see her partner do to make her more comfortable, so until she understands what exactly she is looking for or what could help her heal then I'm not sure what outcomes are expected. Maybe couples counseling with an intermediate 3rd party would help. Definitely an honest conversation, it sounds like her partner has already apologized though and has been respecting boundaries so I'm at a loss.",

That's a whole trust exercise in itself. But you're physically restrained while having physically intense stuff done to you. That's a lot to handle mentally. Most healthy BDSM kinks are *reliant* on aftercare, because that's the mental reassurance that establishes trust, love, and care around all the physically intense stuff. That's the part that builds the bond between you and your partner that makes the more intense stuff less scary so you can focus on the pleasurable parts. If you don't do that part, it can fuck with people.\n\nIf this is something you're not completely scared off from now (which is totally understandable) I would definitely recommend having the aftercare planning conversation with your bf and explaining that how you feel RIGHT NOW is exactly why it needs to be in your BDSM routine.",

I might REALLY enjoy being on top of a building like when I was young, it may give me a huge adrenalin and happy rush, but the first time I did that (and enjoyed it) but realized I now swooned when I even tried to look down-- yeah, I am never going to do that again, suddenly. Despite all the familiar happy chemicals.\n\nImagine someone who's entire trauma-management processes are pretty much exclusively being hyper-vigilant of their environment, without fully recognizing that fact (aside from focus issues or not being able to read books or to program code well). What would that person do if being ultra-aware of their surroundings suddenly had no effect on their ability to insure their safety, for the first time in their life? Tons and tons of people are ultra-vigilant to various degrees.\n\nBDSM is something I would roll back into my life only in a particularly perfect situation, with exactly the right person(s), because everyone is different. It can be a non-trivial experience. The alternative for me personally would be to jump into a network of lifestyle people, but hahaha that's a big jump for little old me. WHOOSH. I am not sure OP could have successfully researched enough to know her reaction.\n\nI have also known people who need to be blitzed to get their kink on. But it would be equally wrong to say, \"That's just because you weren't drunk enough, or stoned enough.\" Not everyone is the same.\n\nNot to overdo the only three poor analogies I could think of-- but-- It's not my conscious that naggles me now if I get on a roof, I'm certainly not feeling guilty about being in the wind with a great view. But I won't do it any more, because I was in a space where the last time I did it was very traumatic. And also, internal trauma in general is more subtle and omnipresent that we currently recognize as a culture, even as from subtle abuse over long periods or bad parenting. We are just now getting a grip on even partially functional trauma management processes and their commonalities and differences between people. Trauma is not a bad word and OP sounds like it was traumatic, and that's not a bad thing either.\n\nThere are probably a billion examples of people reacting differently to different psychological situations, not just my three poor ones! And a billion reasons \"why\"-- if someone has to define \"why\". I just don't buy guilt or unfamiliarity with new feelings, being necessarily relevant to this.",

Coming down from that power exchange is a big deal, and you will feel vulnerable and confused while you \u201csober up\u201d. You need your partner to snuggle you and reassure you and bring you down gently. \n\n2.safe words are important but once you are submissive you can feel like you don\u2019t want to disappoint your dom. A good strategy is a \u201cstoplight\u201d approach. Green tells your partner that you are good to go. Yellow tells them that you are still down to clown, but whatever they are actively doing is a bit much, or you need to switch things up. Red means we are done, take the clamps off and untie me. \n\n3. Your partner was either enjoying it because you were, or you awakened something in them. Either way, you can continue to explore if you want to. If you have an itch and you scratch it with a belt sander; it\u2019s logical to think you just shouldn\u2019t scratch itches, but there\u2019s often more effective ways to get the same release. Like, if you want to be spanked, is is the physical pain, the helplessness, the being punished? Once you break down the kink you can find less overwhelming ways to satisfy it. If you explore slowly you might even find that what you thought you liked, isn\u2019t even what you actually want, it\u2019s just a less efficient way to get what you actually crave. \n\n5. There is nothing wrong with you, or your partner. You like what you like and so do they. It took me years of therapy to stop feeling guilty for crap I can\u2019t control. There\u2019s a lifetime worth of exploring. Kink porn is like regular porn, it\u2019s not really indicative of real life. Talk to your partner and tell them EXACTLY what you are feeling. Part of the fun of being a dom is paying attention to what your partner tells you, and coming up with something they never thought of that turns them into jelly when you try it.",

After an intense scene, it can be really, really important for many people to connect to the more \"loving\" side of their partner in a real and intimate (but nonsexual) way.  Sometimes after a scene I might spend 1-3 hours just cuddling, talking, being with my partner - reminding both of us (doms need aftercare too!) that I'm not a monster, that it's a part that I play but not a person I am.   If you are new to it, I'm guessing that the aftercare was probably not as well done as it could've been - it takes a lot of experience to get good at it.  \n\n\nI recommend trying some light physical intimacy with an express \"no sex\" idea.

I agree with other commenters that your BF probably enjoyed the idea that he was able to give you something you said you wanted. Only you can work out what it is about it which upset your idea of him or your idea of yourself, and how to fix that. One of the best things about BDSM is that you must develop a trust relationship and be open to your partner about how you are feeling, and it can form the basis for a very deep relationship. You might find the BDSM checklist of use and interest as a way of starting a conversation. Your BF hasn't changed, it's your attitude to him which has, and you need to work out why this has triggered a wish to distance yourself. Consensual and safe are the watchwords, and it seems that you don't feel safe in some way, perhaps? Building a trusting relationship is important in any partnership but it is essential if you are going to experiment with BDSM in any form.",

I also believe that this abuse, though not those exact scenarios, mean that my own pleasure is directly VERY tied to my partner's pleasure. The more I see, hear, and feel that they are enjoying themselves, the more turned on and amazing the sex is.\n\nMy problem ... I've sort of skirted around this fact because I feel like telling him directly either \"You need to be more vocal, you need to say \"____\" exactly/similar\" will make my brain short circuit, knowing it's not real, and therefore not only negate any possible upside, but shatter the fairly mediocre amount of pleasure I get already (during 95% of our sexy times) by his more passive style of portraying his own pleasure experience... I want it to be real, I (only **think**) it**needs to be real**, and if I spell it out, he'll be acting...\n\n[If my BF suddenly wanted to try something new, *no matter what it was*, if I (at the time) felt comfortable going through with the trial of the kink, and it resulted in what I perceived to be an increase in his pleasure for **whatever reason**; His reaction I perceive, etc., I would be SO down for trying it again, but *not* because of the kink he was into, but because it played into my own kink having *only to do with my perception of his pleasure*.]\n\nI just sort of word vomited here, but what I'm saying is, OP, if the M/F roles were reversed, and I was your BF, the commentary I'm replying to hit the nail so on the head it's scary.\n\nTalk to him.\n\nWhy am I giving you advice to talk to him when I won't my own SO? \n\nYour post has inspired me to.\n\nYou literally opened my eyes to the fact that full honesty will lead to us both, so long as it's consensual, to finding what I have always wanted from, but never given, him.\n\nYou just blew my mind here, and this is a 6 year relationship. \n\nYour inspiration, my Gods.

Have some water and maybe a light snack on hand. Most importantly, take the time to reconnect mentally on a \"vanilla\" level. If they want physical comforting, provide that. Discuss what happened, and how you feel about it (IF that's something you/they feel like they can do in the moment, otherwise save that part for later). It's about gently coming back to a regular state together, as opposed to leaving the bottom in the lurch to abruptly deal with the aftermath alone.",

This could happen if they feel pressured from their partner, or just aren't listening to themselves).\n\nBut at its best, BDSM is one hell of a ride and strengthens the respect, trust, and closeness you feel with your partner(s). I'm a sub, my partner and I enjoy roughness, some degradation, and bondage. But at no time during our sessions do I feel unsafe or unloved, because we communicate constantly and immediately put on the brakes if EITHER of us need or want to.\n\nIt's really really difficult to be involved in bdsm because a lot of people don't understand the trust and responsibility required, they just think  \"oh, I like spanking and I'll do it to my partner\" but don't talk about it, or they'll call their partner master/daddy/etc without explicit consent to do so.",

I feel like BDSM also comes with a very strict and similar IF. Currently, taking meth IS demonized so is it really wrong to demonize something that is potentially very harmful and even fatal in some cases, like BDSM without the aftercare or whatever is necessary? These are some of the arguments I've heard and I dunno, they seem kinda convincing to me.",

I also think that there'd be quite a lot of people who will benefit from the warnings. Hardly any solution is 100% effective anyway.

That awareness ought to be spread about BDSM, imo. \n\n>It's really sad that the first contect with this topic, for most people, is porn...

That's how sophisticated abuse works.\n\nSee, when someone is attracted to something, they are likely to try it, no matter the warnings. That's how people work, they wanna make their experiences for themselves. That's why sheltering your child doesn't work. And that's what abusers prey on... They will rope you in, make you curious and make the first experiences pleasent ones, until they got you in a spot where you are easy prey. Otherwise these things wouldn't be happening, newcomers would be turned off instantly. That's grooming.\n\nThat's why fact-based awareness education works so much better. People won't have the feeling they have been duped into thinking something is bad, when their first experience doesn't reflect that, at all. They won't just forget the warnings.\n\nAnd there is another aspect to it: Once they are in the victim position, do you think they come for help to someone they feel would judge them for engaging in something \"forbidden\"?\n\nThat's really why I don't like the concept of demonizing something. Yes, sure, sometimes it would help, but overall it seems like a easy cop-out for people who don't want to go into the details, good and bad, of something they dislike. Ignoring that it does stigmatize people who do not deserve it.\n\nAnyways, that's my 2 cents on this aspect. I do vibe with what you say tho... I can relate to the sentiment, a lot, at least on a emotional level. I do not wish harm on anyone, really, and I will not deny the harm that is being done. And, as I said, I do think it's a important topic to engage in, for the people who have already been harmed... Even if it is just to make room for their emotions. One can't be rational and impartial, all the time.\n\n>This really is sad and so true.\n\nIt is, yes. And it's just as sad that adults don't want to educate their children on something that basically everyone engages in, at least at some point..",

I think warnings do a lot of good for the majority\n\nI'm basing my opinions purely on my own personal anecdotes, so I suppose I could be wrong.\n\nMy first night on ecstasy was one of the best nights of my life till date. Had an amazing experience with acid too. I've always been told not to do drugs by my parents and others in my life. As soon as the experiences started to turn sour ( a year or so later )and I started getting palpitations and anxiety disorders, I realised the warnings were something I should've taken more seriously and even asked my parents for help, which they gave me readily. Been free from any intoxicant for years now. \n\nI feel like the warnings made it even more clear to me that I had made a mistake once things turned bad and that I needed to get things back into order. \n\nI suspect that we may not be disagreeing on a lot though. I agree that fact based awareness and education is the best way forward but I think that is exactly what I'm talking about when I mention warnings. The only call out is that we don't have a lot of facts on the exact effects of or the right ways (if any) of engaging in BDSM and of doing hard drugs so the best we can do is tell them of all the dangers that we DO know about.\n\nEdit.

You see, when we talk about demonizing something, we are not just talking about simple warnings. Demonizing something means greatly exaggerating the warnings, in order to push people away from something, so they do not engage in the first place.\n\nThat's why it crumbles to dust with the first experience with something. In a world where you need to put in work to engage with something, that would work well... But kinks aren't like that, at all. Even ignoring imagination, you open one pornsite and it's everywhere. Hell, it's in Hollywood movies... So, you see, that's when demonizing doesn't work, because it's a lie, even if, at the core of it, there is a lot of truth. You first have to reach that core, which is what we do not want. It only starts working, once you are in a victim-position, already. It works, when the harm is already done.\n\nI think your experience is a pretty good example for that. You are sober now, but how long did it take to get rid of these anxienty disorders? Did you get rid of them? Because, if someone would have educated you on how to consume more responsably, I don't think it would have gotten to the point. At least assuming anxiety doesn't run in your family. You see, factually, both of these drugs are significantly less harmful than alcohol and cigarettes. And to push that further, I know people who have consumed hard drugs, cocain, crack, heroin, in a way that, overall, helped them.\n\n>I suspect that we may not be disagreeing on a lot though.\n\nHah, well, then let's agree on that :) It's the issue with online discussions, really... You think you have to engage with everything the other person says, not realizing when you should be arguing or trying to understand what the other person said...\n\n>The only call out is that we don't have a lot of facts on the exact effects of or the right ways (if any) of engaging in BDSM and of doing hard drugs so the best we can do is tell them of all the dangers that we DO know about.\n\nJust on that note... To be clear, I see no issue with talking about all the dangers. But, let's assume that's all true. Wouldn't demonizing something hinder the process of finding these more healthy approches?",

Not being aware of this means big feelings can feel even bigger.\n\n1. Drink water\n2. Do things that make you happy\n3. Be aware that it\u2019s happening, context is important \n4.

I'm a dominant person in the bedroom, but I am not the kind of guy who gets violent, or abusive, or anything like that in my relationship. In fact my wife says I'm too nice to her haha. When we initiate a kinky encounter, I'm very demanding, degrading, etc. There's physical stuff too like tying up, some pain inflicted by spanking/flogging, etc. Since that's not who either of us are, it's almost like we enter a different headspace/mindset, sometimes called Domspace/Subspace or some variant. The release of dopamine and shit fucks with your perception of what happens as you're coming out of it. Think of it like post nut clarity, but instead of \"wow, can't believe I just jerked off to a woman's prolapse anus\" to \"wow, I just hit my partner whom I love dearly, called her a filthy whore, and enjoyed it\". It can be a rough transition. For a top it's colloquially called TopDrop and for a bottom/submissive SubDrop. After care is 100% necessary even if no sexual gratification was achieved, to make sure all parties involved are able to come back to their usual self safely and securely, and nobody feels like they were abusive/abused. It's frequently ignored or forgotten about however, which makes me absolutely insane.",

Being drunk, high or pressured into things is not consensual.\n\nExample: asking somoene for rough anal sex before sexy time starts is good.  If one says yes, and the other says no, then it's off the table.  If you give said person alcohol, weed or even beg to get them to change their mind, nope.  not consensual.\n\nIf  you give them oral and they get off and you give them 30 minutes of unparalleled pleasure with toys and other things then ask them after they just came 20 times in a row if anal is ok, and they say sure, go for it... guess what.  Nope, still not consensual, as they are now in headspace and not thinking clearly.\n\nJust because you might be into trying it, even as the bottom or the person getting fucked, the top may not be into it, and say \"I don't know...\" and you reply \"oh come on, just this once, how do we even know if we like it or not?\" and they reluctantly reply \"if it makes you happy, I guess\" - that's coercion, and thus, not entirely consensual.\n\nconsent is consent.  ask first, get it all on the table, and also discuss some safe words; I suggest the industry standard, yellow and red.  yellow means \"slow down and check in,\" red means \"full stop; we're done.\"\n\nSo if you're burying your junk into someone's anus and start pumping away too soon, and they say \"Yellow\" you stop, and ask \"are you ok, is everything ok?\" and listen to what they say for feedback.\n\nIf you go balls-deep and suddenly they just aren't feeling it anymore and say \"red!\" guess what... pull your junk out and towel it off, because the scene is done and you need to grab a bottle of water for your partner, a blanket and check in to make sure they are ok and be ready to hold them and talk if they break down.  headspace is wonderful or very fucking scary sometimes.",

He doesn't press me and stops if I tell him to, but he'll occasionally ask. However, he also knows not to listen to a damn thing I say when it comes to the condom. I don't do well with birth control and we agree that we don't want another baby right now, but all of that goes straight out the window during sex. In that moment, I am not capable of making decisions with long term effects. He thinks more clearly and I'm thankful for that.",

Are you able to experience that level of trust outside of these types of encounters, with someone who understands boundaries and consent, is aware of your need for trust and checking in, but without needing the forms of extreme sexuality as a tool? How much of the sexuality is about extremes and how much is able to be separated from that and just be about passion and love for each other without any form of violence?\n\nClearing out trauma can sometimes be like tracking a wild animal inside of us, and when we've really cleared it, it's gone. In *this* type of clearing we need to match the same levels of intensity as the impact that first caused that trauma, and so I can see why your experience worked. I'm just curious if the comfort you found came from fully clearing it, and an ability to move on fully. Or if you got close to clearing it fully but not quite all the way, and now are more in the space of owning it but not clearing it, so you need these extreme elements now as part of your self care. \n\nSort of a once a warrior, always a warrior thing. Vs. Being able to be a warrior, then return from being a warrior without an impact because one was able to fully clear the PTSD and move on without needing war in their life again.\n\nI don't mean to be judgmental, I'm more just very curious and am very appreciative of what you are sharing.

Communication is rhe key to enjoying BDSM in a way that's comfortable and safe for everyone.\n\nEdit: sorry, I must have skimmed the last part of your comment, you covered that already \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

                  "text": "A scene isn't just about the immediate scene. In the run up to it you have to talk about what you both expect going into it and what you expect to get out of it. You should both know each other's tells well enough to be able to read when one of you is losing the plot. Say for example your first scene is a basic spanking scene (and for these purposes I'm going to assume the gf is the sub) you have to pay close attention to her because the first time you strike her hard, any number of things could go through her head. She might hate it and feel uncomfortable but not want to say the safe word because she doesn't know if it's supposed to be like this and maybe if she just relaxed into it or did something different or thought of something else she might enjoy it and she ends up persuading herself to not say anything even though she's hating every second of it on every level. It might trigger some forgotten flashback that she gets sucked into and freezes because fight or flight are out of the window and so you carry on not realising you're compounding trauma. At first it's understandable that you don't know each others tells. It takes time and practice. That's when the communication comes in and I'd recommend you use the red, yellow, green light system and communicate constantly throughout the scene. Red is no, I hate this, I want out. Yellow/Amber is I'm not really sure but for now I want to keep going, maybe just pull back on the pedal. Green is fine to keep going. And again, all three of those definitions should be discussed in advance of the scene so you can always understand what the sub is feeling and where she is. You can have as many of those words as you want if you think you need more nuance. And finally, after the scene is the most important thing. The submissive desire is a thing of two halves - the first is the submission to whatever humiliation or pain they need, but the second half is always, ALWAYS reassurance. You need to care for them, reaffirm your love for them, praise them and tell them how brave and special they are. Think of it like this - you have sex with someone and they tell you you're a filthy sl*t and then once they're done they roll over and go to sleep and you lie awake half the night wondering if that's what they really think of you or if it was just a heat of the moment thing. The aftercare and communication is the buffer that stops that in its tracks. You take the time to reassert the reality outside of the scene and talk through any uncomfortable things that might have come up during it, like traumatic memories that were triggered or an unexpected emotion that either of you weren't anticipating. If it made you uncomfortable to strike her, talk about why. It's the most important part of any relationship like this because its the moment where you're most raw and vulnerable to each other. We all preach safe, sane and consensual, and communication is a massive part of the consensual, before, during and after, to avoid exactly the situation that OP is in.\n\nEdit: omg thank you for the awards!! I've never had an award before. That's made my night - you are all too kind!!",

Because aftercare mitigates how bad drop is. What\u2019s drop? A lot is written about drop as well. But basically, in scene (and sex), your body is flooded with endorphins and hormones and adrenaline probably and afterwards your body now has gone from flying sky high with all these natural chemicals to having a deficit.

Maybe take a shower together. Some people like their bruises kissed. Some doms need a hug. \n\nThe main thing to keep in mind is just not suddenly going back to life as usual. Stay with eachother and both of you should be attentive to the others needs. \n\nAn example: I like being spanked until I'm dripping snot and sobbing, but I had better have my head petted afterwards. I am also known to burst into the room after a workout and demand my bf take his pants off, lay down, and shut up. I'm going to hold him gently after I'm done and thank him for playing along. Also we both like to eat afterwards so he gets his choice of food toted to him while he's still dazed and recovering.",

I\u2019ve noticed an influx of newbies and this is actually why I got into teaching kink workshops in the first place.\n\nAny kink has risk, we often talk about the physical (make sure you have saftey shears for rope, etc) but sometimes neglect the mental. Pretty much everyone has some trauma, and it\u2019s easy to accidentally step on a \u201clandmine\u201d during play\u2026or in the drop phase feel some remorse or regret. \n\nJust know that this is normal and okay; and something you should be able to be honest with about with partners. Even though I f the scene was a good but intense experience, it\u2019s normal to feel dopamine drop afterwards. Couple that to having some intense post play experiences and that can feel rough. \n\nContext is key here. \u201cHey, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I\u2019m feeling not great about this because (___) \u201c is information I\u2019d want to know. Even if you aren\u2019t sure why or need space to process; part of ethical BDSM is mutual accountability. \n\nThe tricky part here is you BOTH are new, so there\u2019s like a lack of experience to give context to this. If you\u2019re going to pick this back up, I recommend looking for an organization in your area that does educational (not play) events and going together. \n\nI really hope you can get to the core of why you feel the way you do. Just give it time and be kind to yourself. It\u2019s not as easy as it can look and porn isn\u2019t real. \n\nYou got this, homie!",

I'd keep my profile vague at first (lest ye be inundated with thirsty folks); but look at local events. Pub nights and munches are a good way to meet folks. Often larger organizations will hold monthly public meetups so folks can socialize in a lower key atmosphere. You can find both regional and online stuff there.\n\nOnline Events: Easy to find and great! I've done stuff with Dating Kinky and that's been pretty fun. Often a single topic, but regularly re-occurring. Not as interactive, but you can usually ask questions which is cool. A great start.\n\nRegional Classes to Medium Conventions: Harder to find, but they exist. Often done in conjunction with a group. May be a single shot or part of a event. Events are often classes during the day with open play offered afterwards. A place like \"The Crucible\" or \"Studio 58\" in DC are examples of this.\n\nLarger Regional Events: Large \"takeovers\" and multi-day events. May offer a place to stay onsite. Something like Dark Odyssey Fusion is a 5 day event with dozens of classes and events and lots of spaces to do your own thing. They take over a whole camp ground. There's also more focused events: \"Tethered Together\" is a woman-led rope-centric convention in the New England area. If you google either of them, you can see the schedule and get an idea of what they do and how they do it.\n\nEvery event has it's own \"vibe,\" so your best bet is always bringing folks you like if you can and testing them out.\n\nWhen I do my classes, I always start on a quick primer about consent and acknowledge the power dynamic inherent in instruction; then the rest is talking, handouts, and as much interaction as possible. So for a violet wand class, I do the aforementioned, talk a bit about the gear and how it works, then we do some hands on where folks can try in a low pressure and de-sexualized environment. If it's a communication based class, we usually get some role playing and practice what we've learned (negotiating and aftercare for instance).  \n\n\nEdit: To add, there's a TON of info out there...which is good and bad. Get many sources, keep what works, beware the \"one true way.\"  Midori is the shit and a great starting place. She rocks.",

Writing a letter may feel impersonal, but it lets you state what you need to in the way you need to. You can talk after he reads it, or not, but it is a very effective way of doing things. \n\nSeriously though, aftercare. The same way you set up rough play, you need to care after. Talk about feelings, hold each other until the emotions come back down. It's okay to be not okay after trying something. Vaginismus is a really common psychosomatic (and also not always psychosomatic) problem with sex. That can come from pain, discomfort physically or emotionally, or any number of reasons that we may not always understand. Emotions are the same way. If that means you take a break from intimate touching and rebuild your emotional bank account for a while, do that. But please don't leave your partner in the dark on this.\n\n If they did like it and you don't, that's okay. Sex is a two way street, and both parties need to consent to doing something. Cut it out, discuss **what** they liked about it, and if you're comfortable you can experiment with it or something similar. But ONLY when you're both comfortable.\n\nJust think about the (hopefully) numerous conversations you had before trying rougher play. Your post care should involve just as many.",

Aftercare is probably the second most important part of BDSM, after enthusiastic consent. \n\nBeing submissive in scenes causes a lot of wild emotions and even physical, neurotransmitter-related reactions. Without the aftercare, it can absolutely lead to the feelings you are currently going through. \n\nWhen you talk to him, try not to be hard on him about it, because I\u2019m willing to bed that his enthusiasm and pleasure during the scene was mostly because of his belief that you were really enjoying it. Just let him know that you\u2019d started to feel uncomfortable during the scene, even though you were still getting off on it, and that you regret not using your safe word. Be honest with him about your feelings, and don\u2019t be afraid to ask him for whatever reassurance you need from him. \n\nIt would probably be helpful to post about this in the bdsm sub here on Reddit, r/BDSMCommunity. The people there are great at answering questions and are incredibly helpful. They will be able to explain the physical and emotional phenomenon of sub-space a lot better than I can, and they will have great advice about how to best move forward from here.",

Instead of actually understanding what he enjoyed about it by talking, you risk filling in the blanks with your own assumptions and that seldom ever works well. He was part of this and needs to be included in the conversation not just to help give you a more accurate understanding of the various elements at play, but because aftercare involves teamwork and part of that is the necessary dialogue to explore what did and didn't work, what boundaries you need, and work out any potentially damaging sentiment like what you're dealing with now. A therapist isn't a bad idea but you NEED to talk WITH your boyfriend as well. A therapist doesn't replace that. They're an outside perspective that can only go by what you tell them, so they get one narrow angle of a much more dynamic situation and that isn't going to do the good I think you're hoping for.\n\n\nYour boyfriend cares and deserves to be included in that conversation because this involves him every bit as much as it involves you, too.",

Then they left after we grabbed food, said nothing to me for a week and accused me of a bunch of horrid shit and I was traumatized. After we worked through that and sat down and talked they came to me for sex again I couldn't get it together anymore. I always kept questioning myself in the bedroom and it continued with multiple partners for years until just recently. \n\nI finally have a partner that will talk that stuff out with me and it's been so healing. It's like I'm getting a literal decade worth of aftercare as a result of just not being seen a disposable Dom toy or some crap. I feel whole again.",

Have I said anything that made you uncomfortable?\" Pausing the conversation to have this discussion was totally helpful in the past with both a long-term partner (now ex) and with somebody I had just started seeing.

You spank them, degrade them, fuck their mouth as they cry, whatever you\u2019ve previously discussed that gets them off.  But after, you feel really shitty. Did they really want that? Did you go too far? Are you a piece of shit person for what you did?\n\nAll of those thoughts occupy your head as a dom. Thats dom drop. That\u2019s why aftercare is super important for both parties, not just the person who was submissive. You both need to talk about what you enjoyed, or didn\u2019t, or just how you feel.\n\nThe person crying as their face was fucked may have seemed uncomfortable in the moment, but aftercare will let you realize it was probably their favorite part, so for the dom, they can release their guilt, knowing they were making their partner happy.",

Communication is super important as a first step to fixing this.\n\n[Here's an article on sub drop recovery which I hope helps](https://submissiveguide.com/fundamentals/articles/some-of-the-best-kept-secrets-to-sub-drop-recovery)",

Whether it's being blindfolded during missionary, or spending 12 hours in a sensory deprivation mask and trying orgasm denial, you're a member of the community.\n\nI am very glad that you'd take it seriously though. I think a lot of people don't, especially after seeing the shitshow that is 50 shades, and that causes issues.\n\nAgain, do what you think is best for you. If you ever do take part, I hope you enjoy it. Start slow, discuss aftercare first, and eventually you'll find the sweet spot of kinkiness for you and your partner(s)",

It's one thing to KNOW that your partner is back to the loving person they are, and a completely different thing to FEEL it. The whole point of kink is to make you feel abused or threatened or unsafe (because that's what excites) but it's just as important to take the time to talk and cuddle and reconnect in your regular way after the scene is done. If you don't your subconscious could still see this person as a threat- especially if the last physical contact you had was rough and then they just plopped off to bed! \n\ntry and talk to your partner about your feelings, and if you are up for it try to cuddle and share some touch in a non-sexual setting. \n\nFeeling this way doesn't mean your partner is bad, or even that you aren't into kink, but instead is a big warning sign that you aren't taking time to diffuse after. \n\nif you do still have any interest in persuing kink i would recommend maybe discussing about and adding one thing in at a time (like rope or spanking or dirty talk) and really talk to your partner about it before AND AFTER the event. you both have to deeply understand how the other one is relating to the play! \n\nand most of all AFTERCARE! he should be pampering you and cuddling you and telling you how special you are to him after rough play, so that it will make you feel how loved you are, and help to re-espablish your mental bonds with your partner - and maybe even strengthen them!",

It takes time to get used to it, and to get over it. That's sort of the appeal, to us anyway, but I absolutely agree that it's not easy and it was not fun for me the first time. We did communicate about it though, very openly, and through the first week or two after the first time. I knew he liked it, and that a part of me liked it too, so we did some research and started again with the very basics. We still enjoy mostly \"normal\" sex, but we've got some good bsdm practices in our back pocket for the occasional kinky night. I hope you find exactly what makes you feel the most safe and happy in your sex life.",

If you took part in impact play (spanking or whipping), or knife play it might include first aid by treating cuts. But there's also the emotional aspect of going from being in a submissive mindset to a normal mindset (as well as a dominant mindset to a normal mindset), which can lead to issues like what OP is going through.\n\nAftercare is unique to each person. For one person, they might have a bath, light some incense and watch some crappy reality TV, then talk about what went well and what didn't with their partner. For others, they might ask for a massage and a meal to be cooked for them. Some might just want to go for a walk and have some time alone, before coming home and going to bed because everything is fine. If anyone is interested in trying BDSM, please please please don't do what OP did and jump into it without thinking about aftercare. It should be discussed early on, around the same time as safewords. And also, take it slow. Start with spanking, then incorporate blindfolds the next time, then try being restrained. Take it at your own pace, as well as the pace of your partner(s), and you'll probably find something you absolutely love.",

Basically there is evidence our brains don't use the same systems to figure out *how intensely* we're feeling as *what* we're feeling... so we can be \"fooled\" emotionally in the same way as optical illusions or other tricks of the mind.\n\nIn BDSM, often what you're doing (perhaps without realizing it) is picking something that creates a really strong emotional state (fear, embarrassment, etc.) and then creating a sexual context around it (sexy words, limited clothes, fetishwear, etc.) to \"trick\" your brain into interpreting that really strong emotional state as sexual arousal. If it's done right, you probably feel a stronger arousal than you've felt by any other means as a result.\n\nHowever, since it's reliant on tricking the brain into thinking those strong emotions are sexual arousal... the moment the illusion is broken (maybe because the sex ends, maybe because your mind gets distracted from the sexiness aspect, etc.) all of those \"misattributed\" emotions that felt like sexual arousal will suddenly feel like their true (likely darker) selves. So, that's why aftercare and the overall context is important. It's not about whether or not you're \"okay with\" the thing is some general sense, it's about actively maintaining a context in which you are okay with it. The context is key.\n\nThat's not to necessarily agree or disagree with what you said.",

She asked him to do something, he did it, and now, according to her words, she \"recoils\" at intimacy, and is thinking about writing him a letter.\n\nThis same situation destroyed a relationship for me. It doesn't sound like she's any closer to being intimate with him, and she doesn't seem to understand that these situations can trigger trauma from a long time ago(not saying that is the case here but it's a possibility).\n\nYou're right about one thing, she pushed his boat out of his comfort zone, and now he could be stranded. I literally had to go to therapy after breaking up with my girlfriend because she wasn't able to talk about anything, and her \"I'll get over it\" attitude was nothing but silence and awkwardness. We went from having a wonderful relationship, to me being incredibly confused about her behavior and distance. It was heartbreaking, and I even knew about aftercare, and had gone into our new kink with much caution. AFTERCARE ISN'T JUST TALKING ABOUT IT. Aftercare is like attending a meeting with an agenda. Both people have to be present and there has to be some common ground, understanding, reassurances, goals, etc. These things are outside of our control because she doesn't seem to have experience, but it seems to ME(and I might be completely wrong too) that OP is trying to take control of this and pushing her BF away. It sucks. They need to talk now, and continue a conversation, for her sake AND for his.",

But anything that's intensive enough to risk trauma to bones or internal organs is simply dangerous.\n\nThen, there's the more complicated psychological unhealthiness. Even when consensual, enacting violence onto a sexual partner can have long-lasting mental health problems. It can also lead to a dependence on these habits for sexual gratification, which in turn could lead to a person attempting them on a non-consensual partner out of frustration.\n\nI could go on, but I think this should suffice to answer your question.",

Sane means things that risk permanent damage of any kind, including to bones and organs, are off the table. You've mentioned consent yourself. \n\n\n\nAs for choking, that's not necessarily BDSM, but the same rules apply. Safety first is a good ground rule for any kind of sex, it just gets more important when delving into BDSM. \n\n\n\nAs for the psychological part, there's a reason why it's called \"playing\" within the scene. If someone can't discern between play and the reality of an act or a while relationship, that person has massive issues. Someone who tries BDSM practices without prior communication and consent isn't into BDSM, they're an abusive arsehole. Anything non-consensual, not safe or not sane is a very good way to be ostracised from any BDSM group.  \n\n\nThis might be anecdotal, but I've rarely seen people as fair, gentle, and open-minded as people who are into BDSM, both within their relationships and in general. Constantly being aware of the importance of trust, consent, and communication probably has something to do with it.",

Not everyone is smart enough to do their homework, and take precautions.

Just like how going from being in a submissive mindset to a normal mindset can mess with you, going from a dominant mindset to a normal one can mess with you.\n\nI was in a fwb type of relationship with an Asian woman who was into raceplay. She gave me express consent to call her slurs. She literally told me the exact phrases she wanted. Yet I still felt like the worst person for giving her what she wanted, because of what I said. She also enjoyed mild impact play with belts (her kinks were more verbal degredation and restraint, but \"some pain is great\"), and a few scenes later, I cut her. I treated the cut after and did all the normal aftercare. She was fine and happy, but I felt like a shitty dom because I went too far. I didn't in her opinion, but I felt like I had betrayed the trust of someone I cared about and gone too far. Luckily, we were both fairly experienced, and we were able to talk through everything and it went back to normal, but for like a solid month I was suffering from dom drop",

Do your research before doing anything. And don't just read one article and stop there. Your BDSM experience will be enhanced by reading multiple experts opinions, because while the Buzzfeed article \"10 fun kinks to get you involved in BDSM\" might not intentionally lead you astray, it could easily do so. What's easy for you might not be what's easy for me. Research and research and then, when you think you know enough, research again",

These people are generally the ones who are considered \u201cstrawberry\u201d, as we are the most complex with our interests (again, comment I replied to mentioned diapers, an \u201cextreme\u201d fetish part of ABDL/little) out of the 3. What you\u2019re not understanding is that, in the BDSM community and the fetishes it involves, there are important power dynamics. If a person with those interests wants a relationship with someone, it\u2019s important to establish that the power dynamic matches up before wasting time. Fetish social media sites have an option to list your role/position for a reason, so a sub doesn\u2019t end up with a sub, or a little doesn\u2019t end up with a little. To us, these things are as crucial as establishing serious religious or political beliefs that could lead to incompatibility. If you\u2019re thinking I\u2019m saying that people should be like \u201cI WANT YA TO SNIFF MY PITS, YOU OK WIT DAT?\u201d while messaging, then idk what to tell you other than you\u2019re being intentionally obtuse to the real point or you\u2019re proving my point that you don\u2019t know how the community operates. I have no idea what about this is so hard to understand.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re taking me saying that not everyone\u2019s affiliation with kink is on the same level *as some kind of slander*, which it\u2019s far from being. People with serious power dynamic adjacent fetishes are not the same as people who like being tickled, light choking, or sucking toes.\n\n*Thats ok.*\n\nNo one said it wasn\u2019t ok for people to be vanilla. No one said it wasn\u2019t fun for them to be vanilla. I even said it in my edit, *different strokes for different folks*. Harkening back to the religion point; I find it similar to how some people are dedicated to religious or spiritual practices and would like to find someone as serious about it as they are. Some people are nonreligious and think spiritualism is wrong, *and that\u2019s ok*. They\u2019re allowed to. It\u2019s just not what some people want, and most people would rather find that out sooner than later.\n\n**It\u2019s ok to be vanilla or chocolate, but don\u2019t have strawberry fetishes and be mad when you spring them on someone and they don\u2019t like them.**",

What I said was in response to your comment that \"people should discuss their kinks (if they have any) with a potential s/o during the talking/texting phase.\" No, they shouldn't do that as a broad truth across society. If some random 18 year old read your comment, believed it, and told a girl that he met that he was into BDSM before they even met for their first date, that would be a very bad idea 99% of the time (even though 99% of the time they likely would enjoy BDSM sex later on if he still wanted to do so).",

If OP communicates correctly, then no blame is placed upon anyone, because this is nobody's fault, just a shitty situation.\n\n> But there's nothing for him to do here.\n\nHe's got to do what he's already doing: support her. The difference is that after communicating, he'll know that she's going through something herself, and that it has nothing to do with him if she seems distant or less affectionate, and therefore he won't jump to any conclusions or get hurt because of that.",

She isn\u2019t a shitty gf she just needs to communicate with him and explain that she didn\u2019t like it. He would likely tell her he was enjoying it specifically because he thought she was enjoying it just as much.

You seem to only be looking at her side of the story and not giving the BF any sympathy here and it's very strange but also telling with the other subs you just linked.\n\nThe submissive in BDSM isn't the only one who can get psychological damage. I'm not into BDSM myself, but I've been a Dom once before in a relationship with someone who was experienced, and a Dom needs aftercare just as much as a Sub does. Saying and doing 'horrible' things to someone you love can be very mentally damaging if you later find out they weren't enjoying themselves at all. This poor guy has no idea how she's feeling but partners who give a shit will definitely catch on that something is wrong even when they're saying everything is fine.",

Who hasn't gotten turned on and done something regrettable (either by yourself or with a partner) that made you cringe or recoil from someone afterwards? \n\nThis is a good opportunity to get better at communicating with your boyfriend. Ask him what specifically was turning him on. As others pointed out, your arousal and just plain doing something different could have been the thing for him. Don't assume what's in his head (either head, 'cuz that small guy is tricky). \n\nAnd one last thing... This is one of the most honest TIFU that I've read. Saying you sound toxic is terrible, as you mentioned that you were trying to get out of a weird head loop. You are aware of the unfair in your head AND WANT TO FIX IT. That is not toxic. Blaming him or yourself (or both) would be. He sounds like a gem and I'm sure you two will be able to figure it out together.\n\nBest of luck",

              "text": ">Why pay for a stranger to hear your thoughts when you got a supportive partner right there waiting.\n\nI had a multi-year long relationship with someone who experienced trauma before she met me. Actually the trauma was very similar to what OP described, in certain ways. This experience taught me a few things.\n\n- 1) Supportive is not the same things as trained. \n\nI can sincerely say that I did my utmost best to listen to her, comfort her, and to support her. However, now that a good amount of time has passed since we went our separate ways, I can 100% say that I was in *no way* qualified to be asked the questions that she asked me. I've never been in the same situation, I've never had to fight the same demons, and I've never been trained to understand any of that. All I had was my life experience and, in hindsight, the best I could realistically do was project. \n\nMany people like to think that they're super empathetic. They're not. They're mostly just projecting with a loving tone. If you don't know what I mean by this, I can almost guarantee you that this is what you do. 90% of the time this kind of support can enormously helpful. But, in the 10% when it's not, it is incredibly alienating (if not outright damaging) to the person who is just looking to be heard and understood.\n\n\n- 2) Also there is a point where relying on your partner for support simply becomes unfair to your partner.\n\nFor the last, I don't even know, 6 months (maybe 8 months?) of the relationship, I spent more time acting as my ex's stand-in therapist than living my life. As much as I felt sincere concern and compassion for her, this was 100% unfair to me. Those months were frankly the most excruciatingly unproductive of my life and they were absolutely set me back in both my personal and professional development. \n\nJust because one person is suffering tremendously, it doesn't mean that another person is required to put his or her life completely on hold for an indefinite period of time.\n\nIf you think this sounds harsh, unsympathetic, selfish, or maybe even cruel, then you have never lived through this yourself.\n\nThis all could have been avoided if proper boundaries were set early on in the relationship. It's one thing to support, it's another to give yourself up completely.\n\n- 3) Jealousy takes many forms. It's very easy to feel jealousy when faced with the idea that someone might be able to provide your partner with better help than you, in a way that works better for both of you.\n\nIf you've read all the above, this one is pretty self explanatory.\n\nVirtually no one would carry out a surgery on their partner (not even a trained surgeon), and would be entirely supportive of their partner seeing an appropriate doctor. For some reason this idea doesn't translate well to situations where a partner needs psychological help, and many people are prone to feeling inadequate when these situations come up.\n\nIf this hits close to home for anyone reading, I strongly encourage you to put your pride aside, come to terms with your own limitations/skills/boundaries, maybe apologize to your partner (if appropriate), and support/encourage them in seeking out help from a certified professional.\n\nMental health is far more similar to physical health than many people realize.",

      "text": "Hi OP. Thanks for sharing your experience. I hope it helped a bit to talk about it. I have some thoughts if you\u2019re interested. For what it\u2019s worth, some mental health science for peace of mind:  - [the myth that bdsm is linked to childhood trauma is being dismissed by modern research.](https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/bdsm-psychology-trauma/). Additionally, researchers are finding that [there\u2019s no evidence that BDSM practitioners have a higher degree of psychopathology compared to the general population.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jsm.12192). No one can blame you for wondering how this may relate to your mental health. This is an outdated idea that dates back to Freud and psychology\u2019s Stone Age, but it\u2019s an idea that has stuck around in society.\n\nFirst, you\u2019re doing the exact right thing \u2014 processing your experience, reflecting, and learning about yourself. That\u2019s a good thing. Processing this way puts you in the best position to be empowered and make decisions that align with your values. I\u2019m sorry that it\u2019s uncomfortable in the meantime. I know that\u2019s a shitty place to be. As others have said, talking to your boyfriend and taking it slow - listening to each other\u2019s experience without judgement - could be something that brings you closer together. If feelings get turbulent in this conversation, which is normal and happens sometimes, agree to both hit \u201cpause\u201d and trust one another to revisit it later when you\u2019re both ready to continue. \n\nSecond, BDSM heightens sensory and emotional experiences, and in the case of role play, it can facilitate a different state of consciousness that can be intensely arousing (as you experienced) and also emotionally flooding (as you are currently experiencing). There are a few reasons for this:\n\n1) a healthy BDSM arrangement empowers both the submissive and dominant to consensually relax some of their inhibitions and enjoy things in private that they may otherwise never share with anyone else. This can be intensely vulnerable, because you are both sharing a part of yourself that you otherwise keep hidden, and you may have conflicted feelings about what this part of yourself means. \n\n2) A heightened experience sometimes needs a soft landing. This is why aftercare is so important - or time spent \u201ccoming back\u201d to your partner. It\u2019s the time where you hold space for one another. Some people cuddle, some people like to talk about it as if it were a movie they watched together, some people cry and are held. The value here is in reinforcing the secure attachment bond between you two. It\u2019s the expression, physically and/or verbally, of \u201cI\u2019m here. I see you. I love you. I love your needs, and they are not too much.\u201d\n\nLastly, your emotions around feeling unnerved are protecting you \u2014 they are saying, \u201cHey, is this safe? Am I okay?\u201d  Trust those emotions. They keep you safe and are just doing a solid safety check. If this is something you truly enjoy with your partner, those emotions will find calm by taking your time and talking things out together  - whether you continue BDSM or not. Your closeness and experience is what matters whether you\u2019re practicing vanilla or playing with one another\u2019s fantasies.",

For example, just play with a blindfold for a couple weeks, then graduate to restraints. You'll know when you're ready for impact play (again start slow, no bull whip, lol) or butt plugs.

Reform the physical bond through safe affection and quality time. Once the comfort level starts to go back up you can also use some soft romantic intimacy to progress it further. Your body remembers the roughness and it's reacting accordingly. You need to replace that memory. That's why BDSM is always followed by aftercare. It brings the sub down slowly and under the direct care of the person who just hurt them. They're vulnerable and exposed and it's important to get the trust back during that time.  \n\n\nBDSM shouldn't be taken lightly without some research. The pain and panic triggers physical changes in the brain and floods chemicals in amounts you're not used to. Afterwards, the withdrawal from those high levels will trigger other physical responses. It's called drop and it can be hard to go through alone.",

The most important part is not to be angry.\n\nThe end goal for both of you is to get pressure relief from the situation and provide comfort to eachother, likely ending up cuddling as a result of the previous mentioned crying.\n\nThis will let your body and mind know that you are safe with your partner, and allow you to feel in a positive way about your partner.\n\nThe important part is that the conversation end in a way that allows you to feel comfortable with your partner, and your partner also feels comfortable with the end result.\n\nYou might need multiple conversations, but communication is key, and dedicating the time required for those conversations is key.\n\nBe there for eachother.",

Of course I agree that couples need to talk it out, but people are still individuals and take their own time to process.  \n\nThere's also nothing wrong with seeking a therapist out to help you figure out HOW to talk about it. That's literally something therapists do. Not everyone knows how to talk about or articulate their feelings with confidence and seeking a therapist out to help them learn and prepare something to say is absolutely a good decision.

This is something that one might actually address in therapy, but with the goal of talking to a partner more, not working things out elsewhere to avoid talking to them. The desire to avoid talking about it comes from somewhere, its supported by thoughts, feelings, sensation in the body, etc. And therapy is one way to interrogate and reverse some of those supporting elements so that one can choose to have the talk, despite some hesitation.",

People know about things like safe words and consent, but they don't think about cleaning up the mess afterwards. And BDSM is all about making a mess.\n\nWith aftercare, the goal is to make sure that both parties are comfortable, are able to speak about how they felt, are able to discuss if they enjoyed feeling that way, and do so in a non-judgmental and caring manner.\n\nBeing able to properly execute aftercare is an art in and of itself - it takes a ton of emotional maturity to examine how one feels and be honest and vulnerable with their partner about it.\n\nWhat you're experiencing is a classic example of insufficient aftercare. You've tried something new, it gave you a level of anxiety that you didn't anticipate, and now you're not sure how to deal with it without making it seem like you're placing blame or having \"the wrong feelings\". And, the longer you wait, the harder it is to address because it feels like \"you should have been able to move past it by now\".\n\nHere's the thing - until you take the time to sit down with your partner and explain that you need to have a conversation about what happened, and you would like to do it without any judgment or any sort of fear that you're going to \"say the wrong thing.\" He also needs to be relaxed, loving, and able to make his feelings known without any judgment on your part. Aftercare is very much a two-way street, and it can test the foundations of your relationship if you aren't able to hear and say scary things without being afraid of being judged.\n\nSecond, you and your partner need to be able to understand and accept that enjoying something within the context of fantasy is not the same thing as enjoying something outside of the context of fantasy.\n\nIt sounds like you guys were doing some rape play or serious domination bondage. That can make the submissive partner feel very very insecure, and it can make the dominant partner experience a type of power they've never had before - especially if the sexually dominant partner is a relatively passive and caring person in their day-to-day life.\n\nIt's important you understand this - just because you felt scared or overwhelmed, that's not a bad thing. As a matter of fact, if you have proper aftercare in place, it can be a fun and stress relieving thing. Losing yourself in the fantasy world, coming out truly terrified, and then going through an aftercare process where you find yourself back in reality - it will cleanse your soul.\n\nBut again, you can't confuse who you are in the fantasy with who you are in the reality.\n\nAnd, back to point one, the way you prevent that from happening is through aftercare.\n\nJust in case I haven't defined aftercare well enough - it's the process that you and your partner use to separate the darkness, the fear, the power, the rage, the abnormalities of your sexual fantasies from the realities of your kind, loving, forgiving, and joyous daily relationship.\n\nIn most cases, aftercare consist of 30 minutes to an hour of cuddling, talking, questioning each other about how you feel, talking about your fears and your pleasures, etc. It's deeply personal to each couple, and it's dependent on what each member of the partnership needs. It's a very giving process from each partner to the other - making sure their needs are met and they come back to reality with love and compassion.",

I don't think he was 'into the bdsm act in which you were constrained and suffering' - from his point of view he was acting out your sexual fantasy. due to the nature of bdsm it's actually fair that he wouldn't know you weren't enjoying yourself. from his point of view he is enthusiastically going along with what you wanted to do, likely enjoying his nude gf (if nothing else), and possibly enjoying doing something 'out of character'. \n\nI think that you are transposing your feelings about the bdsm with his enjoyment of having sex with you and I'm not sure it's fair to look at it that way. \n\nand furthermore, even if he was really enjoying it and loved it - it still wouldn't be fair to hold it against him that he liked something you didn't like. I think that your intense feelings about the bdsm are clouding your judgment. if you wanted to go to a restaurant and the two of you went and he loved it and you hated it you wouldn't be upset with him; because of course you wouldn't. \n\nlastly, I think you should be kind to yourself about the whole thing. there is nothing wrong at all with sexual curiosity. I have tried out some things I didn't like before myself. good for you for experimenting and doing it with someone you trusted. good luck with working through how it made you feel.",

But it's just as vital as consent. Basically, it's the period where you get back to \"normal\", physically and mentally recover, loose the scene and the roles you played and return to your typical dynamic. Usually eating a little snack and drinking some water, cuddling, and chilling with light conversation are the go to things...it helps to psychologically/emotionally reestablish your baseline, the \"danger\" is over, everything is ok. Like laughing after a roller coaster or spoofing on goofy parts of a horror movie as you walk home!\n\nAnyway, OP I hope it doesn't put you off entirely, at least in regards to trying new things! Sometimes what we *thought* we wanted out of a scene isn't what we get...lots of factors, but yeah, sometimes it's as simple as not being totally ready for alr the emotions you'll feel!",

Then the opposite for Dom's because many of them may never think of saying things to thier partner outside of the situation, or being rough, or causing pain or what ever of the many aspects of BDSM stuff went on. So you help bring them back down from that heightened state, that you know that they care about you and that you trust them to respect your boundaries, that any if the nasty things said or did was because you (the sub) enjoyed it, etc.\n\nLots of better explanations, but that's the gist of it, since having rough, aggressive, degrading, controlling, vulnerable sex and just moving on can be mentally harmful to people. Also it tends to lead into the best cuddling.",

You saw something you didn't like in how your boyfriend reacted, and that's important.\n\nMy wife and I have been into BDSM for 14 years now. I have a fetish in that space she doesn't, which she tolerates in small doses, but isn't in to. So we're always cognizant of the difference between \"us\" having a good time, and \"me\" having a good time.\n\nEven though you're brand new to this, even though you literally asked for it, even though he's been supportive afterwards and seems happy to give you space... even though all of that is true, what you saw was real. It either was, or really looked like, a \"me having a good time\" moment, which is hard to build trust on top of.\n\nThis is a shameless blind guess, but he may not be as vanilla as you think, but was maybe afraid to talk to you about kink. Find out if that's the case. That might help you process this.\n\nI don't know, maybe my guess is dead wrong. Either way, don't give up on yourself. You'll feel comfortable and safe again. You'll feel adventurous again. And now you know to go a little slower, and to grill your partners more about what they're into.\n\nGood luck, kiddo.",

The prescription is reassurance, tell eachother you love eachother, that you don't want to hurt/scare eachother, what went wrong AND what went right, so you can have a better time next time. Possibly also cuddles if that's what you need. Replenish that oxytocin~ It's a learning experience for the both of you. \n\nAlso random related aside that might resonate with you; I once saw a movie (Short Bus. HIGHLY reccomend) with a character wanting to explore bdsm. he hired a domme to help him figure out what he liked. He didn't want to go right into the deep end, but also didn't know where to even start, so he was hesitant. She told him \"Put your hands on the headboard. If you let go I'll leave.\" ~chefs kiss~ Perfect explanation. The illusion of Loss of Control is a very fine line to walk but when it works it's amazing. I hope you can have a fun experience next time!!",

If that instance made you feel differently towards your partner permenantly... thats unfortunate, but also possible. \n\nBiggest thing is sitting down amd talking about it. Let him know how you felt during. How it made you uncomfortable, your idea or not, and the unnerved feeling since. Then let him talk about his perspective on the experience. Keeping this dialogue open is super important so you each know how the other felt about and during the experience. It will help him understand more of whats wrong and how to handle things going forward. \n\nAnother thing is to start slow in resolving it. Simple acts like just holding hands, and go up as comfortable from there. Again, with that open dialogue. You can both decide when to push into more intimate things, what those are, and at a good pace (within everyones comfort) while you discuss it pver time. \n\nI wish you luck. Definately been in similar spots myself and, so far, recovered the relationships that have mattered.",

He does a kink thing you wanted (probably forced). And maybe he did like it. So fucking what, kink is a kink as long as he doesn\u2019t do anything without consent. And you just silently harboring resentment to him without saying anything(even tho it\u2019s your fault) isn\u2019t helping anything. And therapy doesn\u2019t always work. Grow up and talk to him. You didn\u2019t do a bad thing and neither did he. Just cause you can\u2019t handle what you wished for doesn\u2019t mean you get to be all quiet and him  take the backlash for what you did. Grow up.",

I don't like to be dominant.  I am dominant all in my life, making decisions for others, I like to let go and put all the decisions onto someone else in BDSM.  People will often mirror darkly their lives in BDSM play, for instance, a quiet librarian would take on a very verbal and dominant role and the power CEO gets ball gagged and spanked.\n\nBDSM is a huge arena to explore as it isn't just rough sex.  You can have completely asexual BDSM play and would probably be shocked by how much actually is asexual.",

He needs to trust that if there is anything, that she will use the safeword. \n\nAnyways, I'm guessing you went to fast and wanted to try something without building up to it. \n\nTherapy is always a good idea. I would suggest that you talk about this to your partner.",

Something more sensual and gentle...mutual touching, massage, softer things like that to ease you back into your intimacy.\n\nAlso, if you're interested in exploring this further when you feel safe to do so, it might be worth considering if you want to be the one in charge, make him feel helpless if he's okay with it. Something like handcuffs and a blindfold can go a long way as a beginner.\n\nSome people love the helpless feeling, not only for the arousal but because it IS intimate to have trust in someone to allow them to make you feel that way. But other people hate that feeling, and either want to be the one causing the helplessness or want nothing to do with it in general....and there's nothing wrong with any of those.\n\nIt's very healthy that you're exploring and trying new things together. Just keep the communication open, and always do your research. And kudos for seeking support here and in therapy.",

When I started, i didn\u2019t take into consideration how uncomfortable i was and it fucked me up for a good few years. Communicate, communicate, communicate, take TIME to learn and trust your mind and body. Jumping into anything that intense, something that can, and usually does, have a large impact on your brain chemicals is bound to be a bit too much or have after effects. Hell for intense BDSM i have a week or two of going over a scene, safe words, limits, aftercare preferences, and even I sometimes leave with a gross feeling since i tend to also go with it since it\u2019s hot, despite feeling uncomfortable. Hope you figure it out, no one deserves to feel uncomfortable or unsafe and your boyfriend deserves to understand your feelings towards it, doms also can need aftercare and feel a lot of guilt.

That is a very hard jump. \n\nIt also sounds like there was little - to no - aftercare. As much as people think it isn't important, it is. I know first hand what sort of mental blocks (for want of a better term) can come from my aftercare. You may have had a sub-drop. \n\nAs for feeling weird that your man enjoyed it, it could be that he liked having some authority/power. There's nothing inherently wrong with that. Bdsm afterall is a powerplay dynamic by definition. \n\nIt's almost certain that he was super into it because you were super into it. \n\nI know for myself, I almost need to wear headphones because the second my partner starts to ... Make intense noises (sorry); it's a race to a photo finish. I don't know why; I just can't help it. \n\nI think it might be important that you reaffirm the qualities in your partner which you admire outside the bedroom. So, as a part of the aftercare, if being romantic was one of his traits you liked, ask him to make you dinner. \n\nIf being affectionate is a trait, ask for it. \n\nIn some of the more emotionally charged scenes I've done, where my partner wanted an emotional release (crying) but, for some reason, wasn't able to get there. It was necessary to revist that scene at a later date. And/or help them to come out of that emotionally charged state. Would you benefit from something like that? Having a release of emotions whereby he comforts you during your drop?\n\nJust my two cents. I would love an update if you're so inclined.",

One of the things in extreme kinks is to maintain a wall of separation between what happens in the bedroom and what is real life. \n\nAt that point sex shouldn't be a reflection of your relationship as adults. Right now you're suffering from fantasy bleeding into reality, this fear that you'll be treated like shit or attacked for real by your partner.\n\nBut that's literally a fantasy. You know because it will only happen if you ask for it, and you enjoy it. So obviously the key is to talk to your partner, do more research, even light therapy to find that wall again.\n\nDon't worry, this is a common problem. Not just in sex. \n\nSome people into acting, watching movies, playing violent video games, or roleplaying games sometimes have trouble and blur fantasy and reality. Not everyone can naturally build the wall. It can be especially difficult for actors since they're surrounded by props and other actors that make the environment seem as real as possible.\n\nThere are a lot of common exercises and techniques that work and help people. Mads Mikkelson has a normal life after spending all day murdering people, and Patrick Stewart doesn't think he's a space captain lol.",

Where both partners find a soft comforting place or position and just relax and soothe each other. Bringing the submissive partner back to an emotional center and away from the intensity of what happened before, kind of dispelling the possible negative emotions that may have been experienced previously. \n\nI know it's been a bit since you engaged in that activity, but it's still worth trying. If nothing else, it may help you to restore that bond and trust with your partner, albeit gradually. Have him talk to you about how much he loves you and cherishes you and would never hurt you.\n\nAnd if nothing else you need to gave him talk to you about how you're feeling with all of this. Especially the issues with intimacy afterwards, he deserves as your partner to understand exactly thr place that you're in and how you both can help to resolve this, even if that means seeking outside help.\n\nI truly think that communication will help you to process this fully.

Then we watched Multiverse of Madness and I felt sick. I had to tell him that I was feeling pretty awful, and that I wasn't sure I could handle doing it again. But also that I was feeling jealous and crazy, that I almost felt like he didn't enjoy sex with me as much as sex with the fictional character I pretended to be. It's obviously still me, but it felt different. Because he knows these feelings, he's able to be supportive in more specific ways, and it's been helping a ton.\n\nIf your bf has no idea then to him you're just pulling away and he doesn't know what/if he did something wrong. Maybe you need to slowly rebuild trust. He can be extra gentle with you if you explain your feelings to him.",

You asked your bf to try something to see *if* it was something you're interested in, and as such, neither of you have any obligation to be into what you tried. And it sounds like your bf has a solid head on his shoulders if he's seeing how you're feeling and being supportive and giving you space. I think someone with that kind of empathy and compassion would understand if you came to them and expressed what's going on in your mind so you could both work out a solution. Keeping a lid on things inside you can only lead to those things coming out in other, a lot of the time unhealthy, ways. Self care is very important, and sometimes that means letting your loved ones know how you feel so you can overcome obstacles together!",

You did say it got you off, you enjoyed it, but can't get out of that helpless mindset if I'm understanding what you said.\n\nAftercare is everything, and it isn't too late to ask for that. \nA discussion and TLC may be all that is needed here. Do you need to be reassured this does not change your relationship dynamic, that he loves and respects you and can separate bedroom activities from real life?\nDid your enjoyment frighten you? If so, what part of that is scary for you?\nWhat about his enjoyment, was that scary?\n\nAll topics you may want to cover with him. Exactly what you're feeling and why. If you don't understand your reaction quite yet, sit and contemplate both on your own and with him. This dialouge is so important to have! Establish your boundaries, let him know what you're feeling, and relieve yourself of all of that negativity.",

      "text": "So, OP, this is from a grandma who was in BDSM when your mom was in highschool.\n\nThis is a normal response and why we always advocated exploring BDSM with someone who has expierence, because it does wake something up inside. Sometimes it's a link sometimes it's a debilitating fear, and to help the \"sub\" process this is something called Aftercare.\n\nAftercare is NEEDED, REQUIRED, after every intense scene. Aftercare involves the body, mind & spirit, where there is a lot of talking, emotional expression, emotional processing, and reassurance from the Dom to the sub.\n\nWhat your expierenceing is called \"Subdrop\", everyone goes through it but with proper aftercare it's manageable. A therapist who is sex positive to BDSM will be better able to help you process what's going on, so inquire if they've expierence with patients who practice BDSM.\n\nLastly, find a mentor in the community. The mentor WILL NOT be scening with you, they won't be doing in vanilla or bdsm sexual situations or role playing (i.e. they won't act like they're your Dom) and ANY mentor who does try to get you do activities with you, for any reason, ghost them immediately. Mentors are there for you to question, process, support you before and after scenes, negotiations, BDSM related activities. \n\nThis is also why it's very important to deep dive anything in porn that you think your interested in. Take it slow, take it easy-think of BDSM as boiling water. Don't plunge your hand in without testing or you'll get burned and...you got burned through no fault of your partners. Whatever your feeling, thinking, spend a moment with yourself. Take accountability for these things as they're You're responsibility (which it seems your doing already) and accept that you feel these things.\n\nThen...communicate with your partner honestly, truthfully, openly and with humanity for yourself and for him. You are taking away his choice to engage in this situation with you, you are denying him agency in a situation which is directly impacting him, and BDSM's foundation is Personal Agency. Which can ONLY happen when all parties are given the full and complete information of what is and has taken place.",

You might be able to brainstorm together some techniques or ideas. For example, maybe a session where you try Dominant could alleviate your tension of feeling helpless. Or a more sensual Submissive experience (like being tied down and gently massaged) could be helpful.\n\n\nLastly, the judgement-free zone extends to both partners: don't be so hard on yourself or blame yourself! It's okay to enjoy it and not enjoy it at the same time. It's a normal process for learning what you like and what your limitations are. Everything will work out fine.",

I really had to cross a personal line to do it, I hate the porn where women are being degraded (slapped in the face, spit in the mouth, putting his fucking feet on her face during doggy style etc.) so I really wasn't fond of the idea but hey.. if she's into it, I'm willing to at least give it the ol' college try.\n\nFirst time I did it she was shocked in a positive manner, she liked it and it turns out I don't have as much trouble doing it as I thought I had. Gentle little slap in between the spanking and tit slapping she really loved.\n\nTwo session after that changed though, she was already looking kinda funny after we started but she winced when I gave her a tap. I pulled the brakes immediately since she refused to ever use safewords (gave me the feeling I was a god damn rapist when she told me I'd gone too far after we were finished so I toned down the kink a lot after that) and asked her what was wrong... Turns out she liked it the first time but was constantly scared of, and anticipating to get slapped as soon as I first did it during the second session. \"Why didn't you tell me or use the safewords?\u201d \"because you seemed into it and I don't want to ruin your fun\" \"I only enjoyed it because I though YOU liked it!

And OP, it's important you openly discuss the issues you're going through right now as well. If he finds out later on he's only going to feel worse. Neither of you is truly at fault here but you will be at fault for witholding your true feelings for the person you should be able to share anything with. The longer you keep it a secret, the more it will eat away at you. I really hope you regain your peace of mind soon.",

I used to be pretty vanilla at first but once I got some confidence, I learned to walk a line between dominant and sub, depending on the situation. It doesn't change the person I am outside of the bedroom though. Your experience with it for the first time is probably what some women feel being thrown into the situation without any say in the matter, and that eventually develops into a kink. Your experience had the option of stopping though, and that's the important part. Don't let your fear of helplessness stop you from enjoying it. Sometimes feeling helpless in someone else's hands that you trust is a great way to get off.\n\nIt doesn't change the person you are, but it does open up an avenue for exploration to what you like vs. what you don't like. Sex is a carnal act, and sometimes you gotta pull some hair or choke some throats. Just make sure you guys communicate and exercise After-Care (SUPER IMPORTANT) because sometimes our feelings betray us if we don't have that reassurance that everything is okay.",

It works in the brain in a different and more efficient way than talking. With talk therapy we process logically, but the problem is we can know something is illogical but still be stuck with the feelings in the mind and with body reactions. EMDR works on feelings and the body, with little talking once you get into the processing stage. In my experience it works roughly twice as fast as talk therapy. I do all kinds of therapy, but EMDR has worked the best for me with adults with a traumatic experience. \nWARNING: get someone who is EMDR *certified*, not just \u201cEMDR-trained\u201d. Therapists don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re doing with EMDR unless they have completed the certification process. People who have had bad experiences with EMDR almost always had an uncertified therapist doing it. Check out the EMDR International Association website (EMDRIA.org) to find certified therapist in your area. Good luck!",

Don\u2019t be in such a rush to do it, because the reality sometimes isn\u2019t the fantasy, and then the fantasy won\u2019t be the same anymore. You can rob yourself of a lifetime of indulging in your own imagination. You can rob others as well.\n\nTake longer to get around to actually doing it. Feed yourself bite sized pieces that you can manage and enjoy. Enough to satisfy, but leave you wanting more. There is no need to rush to getting it done. This is a partner activity, so you have to understand that everyone is on their own level, and you play to the limit of the inexperienced person (that includes the dominant party). You savor things more when you slow down. Aftercare is important, but I\u2019d argue how you approach doing something for the first time is even more important. If you seriously feel secure and safe doing something, if you understand beforehand how something can make you feel after the fact, if you\u2019re aware of the risks involved, it will prevent a lot of problems that can come afterwards.\n\nI\u2019ve been in the same position as you. Disgusted at myself for what I did and what I liked. It took a lot of reframing for me, and a lot of communication with my partner at the time to be okay with this stuff. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. It will work out fine. Feel free to DM if you want to talk about it.

I also was unable to have sex with my boyfriend (even though he had not been in my life during the bdsm relationship) without having panic attacks. Eventually, I went through months of sessions of trauma processing in therapy. I am now in a better place emotionally and am able to be intimate with my boyfriend again. If you are financially able, and feel comfortable doing so, I recommend using therapy to process these feelings. It is ok that you tried this once, and then realized it is not for you.

      "text": "Idk what \"bdsm thing\" you were trying specifically here, but this same thing kind of happened to me & my husband.\n\nHe's always known I'm into more kinky stuff, especially in porn & fantasy, even if there are things I'd never want to do in real life. I don't feel all that official declaring it, but I would say we're more \"into\" bdsm than average people. Certainly would never call us vanilla.\n\nAnyway, even though we're used to some things here and there, there's still sometimes something new. We'd been talking about this one new thing for a while. When we finally tried it, in the midst of it I knew I did not want to proceed all the way to our end goal, and yet felt conflicted about stopping. I didn't stop, we didn't reach that end goal, but finished otherwise. **Afterwards though,** ***I immediately told him everything I had been feeling.***\n\nYes, I had really wanted this! But once we started, I got scared. Wasn't sure about stopping though, cuz I had really wanted to try this, but my nerves kept getting away from me, even though I kept pushing myself. That confliction is perfectly normal! But I know I did not communicate that to him at all during it. I realized afterwards I definitely should have, and I apologized as such (to him of course going *no no it's okay!*). So we just talked about all that, and that was it. We had tried it, discovered those feelings, and realized that was a no for us. As hot of an idea as it was, actually facing down doing it was a different story.\n\nThis is stepping *beyond* normal relationship communication. In bdsm, you may have heard of \"safe, sane, consensual,\" but there's also the Three C's:\n\n1. **Consent**\n2. **Compatibility**\n3. **Communication**\n\nOP, you started off well, but you had a breakdown of all 3. You discovered you no longer felt compatible with the scene/act, did not communicate as such, and probably should have withdrawn consent. Most importantly, you need to communicate ALL of this to him at least afterwards! And now you're caught in a cycle of affecting current & future compatibility & consent.\n\nGotta just bite the bullet & talk to him about it. & it's not like anyone's in trouble; talking about sex with your partner should be a feel-good thing overall, no matter how awkward the topic seems right now. You'll most likely end up giggling & cuddling, & *relieved*. I normally think therapy is great for any reason, but I really don't think you need to initiate a whole thing for this, unless you want couples therapy just to be extra sure everything's good between you 2, or if you're already in therapy & bring it up during a couple sessions.  \n\n\nP.S. - I promise it's just the internet making everything seem so definitively divided between \"bdsm\" & \"vanilla.\" So, besides the communication, my other advice is, don't think of it as \"doing bdsm now.\" That's just a polite acronym that covers a whole world of ideas and acts (& hopefully you *are* only using it as a privacy euphemism here). In real life love relationships, it really is more just *trying a new thing in the bedroom.* Those guidelines & rules & still GREAT there of course! But it's only so coldly laid out if you're only involved with a sub/dom in those role & nothing else in life. Like a sex club or porn company keeps it professionally by the book to protect everyone cuz you're all strangers. Online we have the luxury of thinking everything out, making lists, & editing. When you're actually dating, it's much more casual & on a per-person basis.",

It seems like you're not ok with the level of arousal you experienced during something you consider very deviant. \n\nBeing aroused at the idea of your boyfriend being signifigantly more physically powerful than you are is very common. You don't have to feel any deviancy about this.  There are literally thousands of instances of women in movies and television being aroused over the sight of men doing strong manly things. Having that strong manliness directed at you isn't deviant.  It's just a primal urge. \n\nCould it be that you were more reactive to this situation in general and he enjoyed this more so than the struggling?  Is his much stronger than you assumed he would be? \n\nYou should have an open conversation with your boyfriend. There should be a lot of \"when you did X it made me feel Y\" talk going both ways. And it's ok if the person doing X didn't intend you to feel Y.  That's what you're working out. \n\nThere was a joke people used to tell before people got all uptight about consent: Always try a new thing 3 times. Maybe you caught off guard and overwhelmed the first time. Maybe you did it with the wrong person the 2nd time. But if you don't like it a 3rd time, maybe you're not that into it.",

      "text": "There is such a thing as too much too fast in the world of bdsm.  I think talking to a trusted third party such as a therapist or counsellor is a good idea.  They can help you sort out your feelings and understand them. Bdsm is not for everyone and that\u2019s ok.  If you are still curious and want to ever try again I urge you to GO SLOW and talk out what you want to do before you do it.  This can be simple like having your partner practise tying your arms up or lightly spanking you and just chatting casually as they do it.  Going slow and talking through every action can take the pressure off to perform.  I\u2019ve been doing bdsm for awhile now and I too have days where I just don\u2019t feel right with it and I just tell my partner the moment anything feels uncomfortable either mentally or physically.  You should also practice using your safe words regularly so it\u2019s not as big a deal when you need them.\n\nAlso about your bf being into it. That\u2019s completely valid.  He might have discovered a side of himself he didn\u2019t know about and it sounds like he is being considerate of your feelings. On the other hand it can be shocking when someone you know well and trust shows a different side of themselves in a new situation.  Also you don\u2019t know that what turned him on was you being helpless. That\u2019s an assumption.  Unless he specifically said that you shouldn\u2019t assume it.  That\u2019s you projecting your own insecurity of being helpless onto him. For all you know he could have been just acting for you, or he was turned on about how much you trust him, or maybe you look cute in a certain position idk. Just saying the reason might not be as sinister as you are worrying it is. Best thing to do is ask him \u201cHey what exactly turned you on?\u201d And then ask him to elaborate.\n\nSorry your first time with bdsm was rough.  Remember this isn\u2019t life defining it\u2019s just sex. And knowledge is power.  Do some research, talk to your partner candidly, talk to a therapist. And there is no pressure to try it again.\n\nHope things feel better soon. <3",

Those things are important, but what\u2019s more important is communicating what you want out of the experience, and how you both want to feel. (Also aftercare, etc.)\n\n\nYou said you felt helpless, and while that feeling scared you, it also turned you on. I would dive in to the feeling of helplessness. You don\u2019t have to be sexually abused to have moments in your life when you\u2019ve felt helpless. Or unempowered. Or scared. Or nervous. \n\n\nLean in to what you started feeling physically while your mind created the word \u201chelpless\u201d for you, and challenge the narrative. What\u2019s so bad about being helpless? What bad things happened to you the last time you were helpless? How can you rewrite that story with kink? Because being helpless and cumming at the same time can completely change the way that you interact with the idea of helplessness in every day life. There is a real somatic experience that happens that allows you to attribute positivity with the idea of helplessness. \n\n\nWhat if you were so helpless that you we\u2019re not physically in control of your body, but you *didn\u2019t have to be?* What\u2019s sexy to you about being helpless? Are you embarrassed by any of those things? Can you explore that more? What would help you let go into the joy of being helpless?\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to look like whips and chains and leather and spanks and gags to be bdsm. It can be two hands pinned over your head while he whispers in your ear that you\u2019re not allowed to move, in fact he won\u2019t physically let you even if you try. It can be forcing you to sit on a vibrator until you cum 21 times. It can also be more advanced/painful physical moves like being forced to endure a spanking, choking, rope play, there are so, so many ways to feel helpless. \n\n\nAll of that said now \u2014 talk with him. Be really honest and be really gentle with yourself. Say how it made you feel, talk about why, talk about what you want to explore, talk about how you want to feel, talk about ideas together, and make a collaborative scene together that works for both of you. Then cuddle under a blanket and eat some ice cream after. You both want to give each other what your partner wants, and I bet if you added a little vulnerability to this situation, you could blossom something really beautiful.",

I agree with what others have said - he probably mostly enjoyed it because *you* were enjoying it. My husband has told me a big part of what turns him on is seeing me turned on. He's also been super understanding so far, so I wouldn't be afraid to talk to him openly about it, stressing that you don't blame him. I don't know the two of you, but as considerate as he seems to be, he'd probably feel terrible about you feeling terrible, if that makes sense. I think having an open chat about it would help both of you feel so much better. Hope things go well for both of you.",

You seem to recognize that your thinking is a bit skewed, like saying you\u2019re unnerved by him liking it, recoiling from him etc. and I am guessing you were left feeling a bit traumatized by the whole thing and that\u2019s why you are in that mindset, so yes, please seek therapy if you can\u2019t get past this feeling, for your sake and his.

Too much of a fighter I guess. \n\nUnless literally asked, slight throat pressure and scalp/hair pull is the most aggressive I go. Namely because I don't want to hurt my lover. I've accidentally physically hurt people in the past with pressure I figured was light, so I got a little paranoid.\n\nBut I'm mostly in that category of people, \"If she likes it, I like it.\"\nSo when I am in that \"mode,\" I am not just going at it for my own pleasure, but hers. I pay attention to any weird movements, noises, and facial expressions (if face is visible.) Sometimes safewords aren't enough. Dom has to be aware of subs condition. For first timers, I suggest that, after after the sex cleanup, cuddling and talking is a great idea. Give the mind and body time to catch up with each other.\n\n\nI truly don't think he meant to hurt you. He might have only liked it because he thought you liked it. (Not all of us are totally selfish!)\nAlso, since he was new to it also, he didn't know to be aware of you while in the act.\n\nYou aren't to blame either. I don't care what anybody else says.\nYou wanted to try something out and you didn't like it. I'm pretty sure he will feel like crap, but it can't be help. \nI'm not saying this is what happened, but it is a theory. Maybe in the past, you had a traumatic incident and it WAS repressed. The action of bdsm is subconsciously irritating that.\n\nI will totally suggest that you go see a counselor. If one of my subs were having the problems you're having, I would drive them myself. Believe it or not, a Dom's main job is to protect the Sub. \nPhysically and mentally. \n\nPhysically: To know when too much is too much.\n\nMentally: To keep their psyche safe as they get what they want.\n\nI hope you find what you need and there is no heartbreak along the way. Only enlightenment.\n\n(Edit: Always start light-core and work yourself up to hard-core.)\n\n(Please forgive any typos. I'm on my phone.)",

Do you see how this is fucked up?\n\nI get the fact she tried something new and hated it, but she has now let her actions affect a relationship that is also a part of someone one's life. In trying out some porn fantasy that turned out to be not for her, she has now damaged herself and her relationship psychologically. Now this dude has to figure out this mess, which is completely blindsided. Instead of jumping into something like this, she should have taken baby steps. And now, the bf is probably confused, hurt, and regretting his actions for no reason because she thought this was going to be a fun experience through and through.

OP needs to properly think about what she likes and then properly communicate it to her bf before suggesting it.\n\nI've been in multiple bdsm relationships and it's never been anywhere near this complicated. You simply hint and suggest you're into bdsm. The other person either agrees and you talk about it, or they simply tell you that they're not into it.\n\nThen you try the bdsm that you previously discussed. If all goes well, you enjoy and repeat. If either person didn't like a certain part or even the whole thing, then you simply discuss either during the act or after and you just exclude it.\n\nIt's really not that complicated at all.",

The OP made a mistake and she needs to just accept it and properly discuss it with her bf. The tone of her post makes it sound like she's trying to victimise herself too.\n\nThe bf shouldn't be expected to provide aftercare when the guy probably doesn't even know anything about bdsm, since he was never originally even into it.\n\nDo you really think she needs therapy for this?\n\nIf not, then don't you think she's exaggerating a bit instead of just talking to her bf rather than making this reddit post?",

We can talk more about that if you'd care to stay on topic.",

I cannot envision a scenario where I would \"try something because it looked cool\" and later find it to be \"traumatizing.\" If there were something I wanted to try, I would already be fairly certain I'd enjoy it. I wouldn't recklessly try random weird stuff if there were any chance I'd end up traumatized.\n\nPerhaps the misunderstanding is in the word \"traumatized.\" Victims of actual rape are traumatized. Prisoners of war, survivors of extreme violence.. this is real trauma. Awkward feelings after kinky sex are not \"trauma\" and to say they are just robs the word of its meaning.\n\nI know that communication is key. It's too bad that OP didn't know that.",

It can be acute (a one off), chronic (ongoing), or complex. I happen to be diagnosed with C-PTSD for ongoing traumatic experiences, and a new sexual experience that ends up freaking both parties out, and feels bad/messed up, despite it also having arousing elements or being enjoyable in theory only, can certainly deliver a nasty shock to the body and brain that CAN BE classified as a traumatic experience (if it is).  My dx is, like the name implies, based on ongoing, prolonged traumatic events. Different stuff. \n\n\u201cRandom weird stuff\u201d =  BDSM isn\u2019t all that weird. \n\n\u201cTry something because it looked cool\u201d- isn\u2019t that what figuring out (healthy) sexuality is about? Testing the waters and seeing what looks good and then knowing what **feels** good? \n\nSay you see a porn where dude slaps chick. Hell, it could be from a cartoon, seeing an actual fight, receiving abuse, receiving consensual playfighting \u2014 and your mind starts to get stuck on whether it\u2019s a turn on. You actually try it, consensually, with a partner. Things are going well though you\u2019re nervous about hurting her. However, she tells you to keep going, and to slap harder. She then starts to do a well executed, in submissive character, painful whimpering cry. You suddenly snap out of it. You liked playing around with it, but you\u2019re not into the *role* of a (still consensual) sadistic or abusive type dom, while she may be simultaneously figuring out this very moment she is into that. You may feel repulsed, guilty, scared, and recoil, because you realized that didn\u2019t feel good. \n\nThings aren\u2019t black and white or all or nothing. And this is a REALLY interesting and important topic every couple/partner should be having!",

Someone can get hurt without their partner necessarily doing something wrong or committing a crime or having malice. If I were you, I'd consider talking to a therapist about this. Even if you only see them 2-3 times, it may help you to sort your feelings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck and I'm sorry this happened <3",

You are beating yourself up because you initiated it but were surprised to learn that you didn\u2019t like it - don\u2019t forget that he is in a similar position where he wasn\u2019t keen but was also surprised to learn that he did.

You trusted your partner and felt safe enough to experiment, so I\u2019d say your relationship sounds pretty strong - he sounds as though he would be understanding and non judgemental if you told him about how you felt about your experience. Without communication there is a danger of you distancing yourself from him without him knowing why. \nGood luck & remember your feelings are valid. It\u2019s okay to try new things and decide we don\u2019t actually like them after all. It certainly doesn\u2019t make you a piece of shit",

You were both into it, but you found out that it wasn't your style and remained upset that he was into it. You barely share how you feel with him and get mad when he doesn't reciprocate properly. \n\nYou seem like a horrible communicator",

If I go near a tall ledge, I get nervous because fear of heights. But the other stuff, I can't speak on that because that sounds extremely heavy in terms of emotional processing and the fact that I am nowhere near smart enough to even process it. I get what you're saying about the 'kinda hard to avoid thinking about it', especially since it was recent and emotions are still active.

I personally think that you were scared by how much you enjoyed the degradation, and there\u2019s a voice telling you how that shouldn\u2019t be the case. Maybe it\u2019s the societal part of your conscious having a battle between your morality and your carnal wants and needs. I believe that a therapist would advise you to explore the fear. I bet jumping head first into the feeling that arise from bdsm will be the most therapeutic and help you understand it. Especially since you seem to have a very understanding boyfriend.

I'm not saying you don't trust him, but maybe you weren't ready for the level of submitting yourself that you thought you were which is why you felt helpless after. \n\nSome people like bdsm for that feeling of helplessness, but afterwards you should be able to feel safe and loved by your partner, aftercare is insanely important. Even if it's just hours of cuddling and cute movies and snacks, little affectionate words. \n\nI think the reason your partner liked it so much (other than because he thought you did too, as others said) is because of the amount of trust he felt you had in him to want to do this with him. It gave him power yes but it also told him how dedicated and trusting you were of him, which is an amazing thing to feel, regardless of the situation. \n\nDefinitely talk to him about it. Maybe approach this a lot slower if you decide you want to try again after healing. Do a LOT of research, not just safe words or aftercare. There's a bunch of obscure things about BDSM that are super important for both partners' safety, both physically and mentally. \n\nGood luck OP!",

You jumped in too fast and got in over your head, and apparently skipped the most important part of aftercare where you reconnect with your boyfriend.  \n\nYou say you can't talk to him about this because he would feel like shit.  However, you owe it to him to be upfront and honest about the repercussions the scene had on you. You need to have aftercare now. He needs the opportunity to hug you, cuddle you, explain that was all part of the scene, and he doesn't really want you to be helpless. That while he may have enjoyed it in the moment, it was only because YOU CONSENTED and he thought you enjoyed it.  If he thought for one moment you didn't enjoy it, I'm sure he would feel differently. So awakening a kink in him is completely irrelevant as that kink is built on mutual consent and mutual \"enjoyment\" of said kink. You said yourself that while you \"got off on it\" that the feeling of helplessness was too much.  Him knowing that changes the dynamic of the scene and I'm sure he wouldn't enjoy it the same. But he can't get in depth about that without understanding where you are.\n\nThere are ways to play that can mitigate this. Tops/Doms can proactively check in often. Requiring you to give an active \"yes\" vs you having to say no/safeword when it gets to be too much. This helps with feeling helpless.  You can remove elements that add to being helpless, like remove bondage buy still do other controlling aspects.  \n\nI would also recommend joining your local kink community and FetLife.com.  Go to classes and Demos. Learn from others.  Read books on BDSM.  Educate yourself. Absolutely continue with therapy with a kink friendly therapist. \n\nGood luck.",

There was another suggestion about reverse BDSM too, where you just do gentle but guided stuff.

To make sure I'm reading his needs properly,  his hands are on my throat or wrists, adding more or less pressure so I can mimic it.  Pressure is added very gently and gradually, and I ease up every 20 seconds or so to gauge where he is at. \n\nIt's actually a lot of effort, but I enjoy it because he does.  I would have zero interest in choking a partner outside of this activity, because he has control over what's happening, I am just helping.\n\nI feel like any Bdsm play needs to be brought in just as carefully.  The person who is having things done to them has to have complete control over the situation, with a partner they explicitly trust, and afterwards it needs some cuddling and discussion about how it went.",

He NEEDS to know how this experience was for you, because if he doesn't, how can he know anything is wrong or how to make any future sexual experiences adequate for you to fulfill your needs. This isn't a want/not want type situation. If he doesn't know how you're feeling, then you're both open to another negative experience, which will further reinforce your feelings.\n\nBeing open and honest is crucial to sexual health, particularly when venturing into the deep lands of kinks and other experiences. Trying something you find out you don't like is FINE and NORMAL. I know I've had some ideas for something I wanted to try mentally and when we got to the physical it wasn't how I had envisioned it. Fantasies are allowed to be out there, we have control over them. Knowing my partner isn't enjoying the experience would take me right out of the moment, since that is extremely important to me.\n\nAftercare aftercare aftercare!!",

You didn't mention what act, but I'm assuming something along the lines of a Andrews cross and whips / bindings of some sort as that usually one of the first things that folks think about.  \n\nHere's the innocent mistake part. All healthy BDSM relationship understand that the SUB is the one that actually holds all the power.. it doesn't look like this, but that's what the safe word is for (or safe item, like a sponge ball held in the hand).. You get to decide what when where and how much.. you control everything as nothing is done outside your consent and in that vein the power of the relationship is the inverse of the optics... but this isn't immediately apparently for two people that have never done this. \n\nAnother thought / question that I have is:  Do you think that some of your \"festering\" is that maybe you're ashamed of yourself for enjoying it (which you should absolutely not be)?  That's a very real possibility and something to discuss with a sex therapist. \n\nIf you are into reading fantasy, there is a really good series that honestly does a great job weaving in some of these concepts but is also one of the best novels I've ever read (and has the best heroine every written IMO) and that's kushiels dart by jacqueline carey. \n\nhope some of this helps.",

That helplessness made you uncomfortable but you liked it anyway and that can cause a weird mental shift where you're questioning yourself.  If this is the case then its easy to project that discomfort onto your boyfriend, making things awkward.\n\nIt sounds to me like you both tried something new and both naturally and easily slid into the roles you were playing at the time. That scares the shit out of you because indulging in it can potentially drastically change your relationship dynamic or even your entire lifestyle.. but thsts not necessarily a bad thing unless you make it into one. \n\nSo personally, my advice would be to try it again and see if you feel any different about it.\n\n\nAll that said, I'm not a psychologist, just a kinky fckr with some experience in the area so take this with a grain of salt.",

Do some non sexual trust bonding with your partner to help alleviate some of the distress you're feeling. And eventually your therapist will probably have you reopen communication with your partner. A dom needs to trust you as much as you need to be able to trust them to respect the safe word and *keep you safe* during play. \n\nBDSM is a slow and patient process to get in to. Do not put off using your safe word, you can't go back, but you can always try again. My girl and i spontaneously started a scene (there may have been a reverend and a Bible and i may have been spanked with that Bible on more than just my butt) and my gods it was so hot, but it was too hard too fast so i had to throw a flag. See, you don't just have to build trust with your partner, but also yourself. So even though i was disappointed and we had to drop it, I'm glad i did. We talked about it more after and when we wanted to be spontaneous and try it again, it was AMAZING. I won't bore you with the details, but *trust, trust,* ***trust,*** *communication, communication,* ***comunication***\n\nBest wishes,  OP. take it slow, talk to your partner. You will be okay. Do not let this fester. *trust your instincts*",

      "text": "I don't know what you are thinking exactly, and may have gotten the wrong end of the stick, but here are a few things to consider that may or may not help:\n\n* Yes, do see a therapist. Getting it off your chest on Reddit might help, but that will likely help more. Do see a different one if it isn't helping - it is not uncommon that one therapist doesn't work for you and you need to try another (or even a third). You may also want to try different types of therapy (CBT - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, not the thing it stands for in BDSM; other types of talking therapy, without and maybe with your boyfriend, etc)\n* Remember that most likely it isn't so much doing the things that got your BF off, it was doing it and it turning you on, or him thinking it was turning you on. These are superficially similar, but totally different. It can also be a turn on because of the associated adrenaline rush, or because how he thinks it is making you feel, or because of the trust you placed in him. Most likely anything about how you are picturing your boyfriend thinks about you that has changed since you did this is way off.\n* You can go basically back to how it was before. It may feel like things are different once you have opened up and allowed this, but we are all weird when we are horny and we are all super vulnerable with the people we are (properly) intimate with. You might feel more raw about having done this with him, but you've both shown each other an intimate side of yourselves that you don't show everyone already, and in the grand scheme of things, this is unlikely to be the biggest thing - it just feels like it to you right now (to you at least, by the sound of it).\n* Your boyfriend likely hasn't changed, and you likely haven't found anything new about him that is as profound as you might think - it doesn't sound like he was always into this, and frankly he was probably only into it at the time because he thought you were and it was an exciting and different way to have sex with you that he thought you were super turned on by (generally the assumption is that people only ask for things a bit different like this if they want to try them quite a lot, and the stereotype is that this turns people on a lot if they are into it).\n* Remember that, despite how it might seem, it is really the submissive who has all the power in BDSM. They are the one who decides whether it happens, and if so what can happen. The rest is all an illusion really.\n* He may seem physically stronger, but this is not particularly relevant - I expect that you can trust that he isn't going to rape you, and this isn't something that you only have to trust anyway - he is probably fucked if he does (even with the low conviction rate, an accusation is enough to ruin a life). The point being that your control is not just reliant on his behavior. That is what it rest on in the first instance, but that isn't the only thing. Physical strength is not the source of power that it might seem on the surface. It is not unnatural to feel helpless because of a physical strength difference (not sure if this is why you feel helpless), but it doesn't make sense rationally when you think it through.\n* You should not be ashamed of what you did. Everyone likes weird things to some extent, and there is very little to read into it. It doesn't say anything about you as a person beyond what you enjoy in bed. There is no reason to feel ashamed.\n* Equally, there is no reason to feel ashamed that you asked for something and then didn't like it, or did like it but then didn't later, or that it changed how you felt for a bit afterwards. It was an experiment, and one that he agreed to try too, and all relationships go through periods where one or both of you are working through things psychologically.\n* Generally, men have a higher sex drive than women (or at least seem to suffer more not having enough of it). There are plausible evolutionary reasons for this. I think women often forget how much of a position of power this puts them in in most relationships. If you feel helpless, remember, you aren't. You choose to stay with him (and continue to do so, as long as you do), and choose to have sex with him (when you do), and even if he didn't care about you and want you to always be comfortable, he would have to care about this to stay with you. This might seem a weird way to put it, but what I am saying is that you are nowhere near as helpless as you seem to feel - you choose what happens and are at least as much in the driving seat as anyone. The point is you are not dependent on him in any way that he isn't dependent on you.\n\nBasically, you sound like you feel ashamed and helpless, but you probably aren't helpless in reality and you don't need to feel ashamed. You just need to get to the point where you no longer feel like that, probably starting with rationally convincing yourself, and then convincing your subconscious to stop feeling like that, which I'm sure you can do with time.\n\nAs other people have said: Make sure you talk to him about it. It would not be unnatural for him to think you've lost respect for him, or gone off him, or blame him, or something like that. Stopping having sex with someone is always going to make them feel like they have done something wrong and you aren't interested in them, unless you talk to them about it. It sounds like you are talking about it, but make sure it is enough. It would be a shame to ruin what sounds like a good relationship because of the two of you were each privately thinking different things.",

I like this type of dynamic, however I like many needed help to know how and what to do. I\u2019m not there, nor do I know exactly what happened so I\u2019ll try to advise on many aspects. Spanking or whipping: you\u2019ll have to light and build up. The idea you want is an endorphin high. But you don\u2019t want to do damage. I like to use a light whip/flail in a crisscross pattern on her back. I stop every few minutes to praise her and then continue. Building from as soft as I can to as hard as I\u2019ll go. Light stinging is a great place to start. After we\u2019ve gone as long as I want or is needed, we have sex. Then there is the after care, you\u2019ll probably need at lease 10 minutes. After that the top can ask things like: was that too hard? What would be better? Which whip worked better. One last thing to understand, at least by my understanding.

This is your brain doing what it's designed to do. Experienced BDSM practitioners learn about things like going non-verbal, freeze responses (which it sounds like you went through, knowing you weren't okay but being unable to articulate it so freezing up), triggers, and how to look after each other in and after a scene to try to avoid this happening (and it's still a risk! Experienced people still have unexpected reactions, panic attacks or fuck up, there's a reason it's not mainstream). Particular BDSM acts may be worse for triggering a negative response like this... these are things that are on my personal 'never for a first time' list: nonconsent roleplay, heavy sadism, heavy bondage/restriction and breathplay/choking (which is actually quite dangerous btw, despite porn).\n\nAssuming your boyfriend is a good guy, which I have no reason not to believe, he's exactly the person you need to be working with to return to safety. I'm not a therapist, but avoidance is a common symptom post-trauma, and avoiding this with him will not help. Can you think of some ways to create safe, intimate memories with him? In a way that feels good and empowering for you? Something non-sexual, like massage or hair playing? Or maybe even testing/reaffirming your sense of safety by roleplaying? Eg. initiating sex, and then changing your mind (with your boyfriend's full understanding and consent, of course!)\n\nGo slow with this too, and talk about it a lot - safewords and all, even if it's not strictly BDSM you're doing. You'll be okay, and if you do get a therapist try to find one that is trauma-informed and kink-educated!",

I know it\u2019s difficult, but if you want to maintain intimate relationship, you are going to have to push past or sidestep or mitigate your sense of shame about what happened and your responsibility for it. You need to be able to honestly talk about your feelings. You need to be able to talk about feelings that you are not proud of, feelings that you think you should be able to handle by yourself, feelings that you think you should fix but don\u2019t know how to fix, feelings that you\u2019re worried the other person might find unattractive. You have to be able to talk about these feelings if you want to have an intimate relationship.  \n\nClarifying, by intimate relationship I mean an open and honest emotional one. I\u2019m not using it as euphemism for sex in this case. I think it goes to say though that your sexual relations seem to be suffering due to the current interrupted intimacy. \n\nAnyway it\u2019s easy advice to give. I fully believe in it through difficult experience. I don\u2019t have an easy roadmap to get past that fear. If you can do it, you may get hurt but it\u2019s also the only real path to a great relationship.\n\nPS:  I know I didn\u2019t take any time upfront to acknowledge that what you\u2019re going through is very difficult. Sorry. I don\u2019t mean that you have done anything wrong or that you are being a bad person or that you made bad choices or anything negative. I\u2019m pointing out that I don\u2019t think you can work this out without being as honest with your boyfriend as you\u2019ve been in this anonymous forum. It\u2019s much much scarier to do that.

Focus on communicating *your* feelings, and make sure that he knows that you\u2019re not casting judgement about his actions or blaming him for how you felt. Use a lot of \u201cI feel/felt\u201d statements. Then let him do the same.

      "text": "Aftercare is a critical thing in BDSM because you are going through not only a physical experience but a psychological experience. It\u2019s important to talk it out and let each other know what you experienced. It can also often take days to process what you went through and it\u2019s OK to have new thoughts about it what do you like it or didn\u2019t like it or things you want to change. For a lot of people BDSM can be about self discovery on things you like and things you don\u2019t like the things you never knew about yourself. The important part though is with your partner that you communicate is that is part of the key of trust and love. For some aftercare requires that they cuddle with their partner after the event, some need to be left alone, some need to curl up under a weighted blanket. You may want to try cuddling with him as you talk about what you went through. Reestablish that you have a safe place with him. Down the road if you care to test the waters again maybe you dip more into sensation play and ease into the level of control you do or don\u2019t have. Checking in with your partner is also important as you play. I personally like a system of using numbers 1 to 10. 1 being it\u2019s barely doing anything 10 being stop immediately. nines and eights would let my partner know that they need to back off and ease up. In your case right now it sounds like aftercare is still needed and it\u2019s OK that it might take a while to process. And know that it\u2019s OK to change your mind about how are you feel about what you experienced. Fantasy and reality are two different things but as long as you know that you have someone Who cares about you and you can trust as you experience these things that helps keeps you grounded.",

There are a couple of pointers I'm willing to share too.\n\n1) Stick to \"I\" statements as much as possible to talk about your experiences and feelings. \n\n2) As much as possible, try to avoid saying \"you\". For example, instead of saying \"When you did X to me...\", say \"When X was done to me...\"  This can be tricky, since English is geared to assign action verbs to people/things doing that action.\n\n3) [Avoid Faux Feelings (see link for further explanation)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.mediateyourlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Feelings-vs-faux-feelings.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjD4bOBzcH4AhVFEEQIHWHCCjkQFnoECAYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw35Sg4DcWaBR3pGaTMlwwkC)",

There\u2019s a few context clues in here that make it seem a little more intense than just rough sex. I personally (emphasis on this is just how I feel about it), I couldn\u2019t ever be into beating my sexual partner or enjoy a rape fantasy. Even if they were enjoying it. I\u2019ve turned down both from people I was sexually active with because I know it\u2019s not something I\u2019d enjoy. So add to that being with someone you love, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be able to look at my bf the same way if he had enjoyed raping me or beating me while we were having sex. OP may have subconsciously been testing the limits of their relationship, and something like that really was alarming in an otherwise docile person. Maybe the bf really was enjoying having that kind of power over someone if he\u2019s that vanilla in everyday life. OP should still go to therapy though.

Since we both consented and there def was arousal, I didn\u2019t know any other way to really be sexual and it fucked me up for a good 7 years after. I don\u2019t blame him at all, but my family found out so in addition to the accidental scarring from the actual sex, I had the added trauma of having my texts read aloud by 4 adult family members and being told I was depraved, disturbed, and also naive to think that I had the right to consent to something like that so young. Ten years later and sometimes it still affects me now. Really messed up my sense of boundaries and right to privacy. If my family hadn\u2019t stuck themselves in my sexual life so young, I think I\u2019d have naturally figured out that kind of sex wasn\u2019t for me over time and I\u2019d only have one kind of trauma to manage. \n\nOp, my advice is to talk about it for as long and as in-depth as you need. Don\u2019t feel ashamed to go to a therapist with or without your partner. Express the confused feelings and process with him if you can. And as others mentioned, he likely was only into as much as he was because he thought you were into it. Remember the love and try to find a safe and loving activity like a massage, a hobby together, or even a getaway where you can experience intimacy in the shape of accomplishing something together, or working out together, or just spending a lot of time talking. There are more ways of being intimate than just touch and sex.",

That\u2019s so refreshing to be able to express that and have it heard and respected. Not everyone gets that support. I\u2019ve been with my wife for almost 15 years, and sometimes you\u2019re going to test things and then be like \u201cnope. Not for me.\u201d The key is the respect to talk about things before and after. \n\nIt seems like he is supportive of that and is giving you the space you need to address this, but in addressing this consider including him some. Sex is obviously the most intimate of things but it sounds like you and your partner are open with each other to talk about sex and and are mature to the point to recognize the emotions associated with it. I hope that your partner wouldn\u2019t want you going through this alone, if they knew you were struggling. And even though it might be you with the scar, he was there when you received it. It doesn\u2019t have to make him responsible for your scar but he might be able to answer some questions or help get some clarity for you. That\u2019s not to say he can address (maybe) issues about why your having these feelings, but maybe he can help you with the event itself and where to go from here.",

She went through the prep with toys and whatnot for a few weeks and then told me she was ready. We started slow, and as it got more aggressive she burst into tears. Needless to say we stopped immediately and focused on just non-sexual care. She hated the experience, but she was terrified because she thought I liked it and wanted it again. \n\nThe best thing you can do is tell your boyfriend what happened, how you feel, and what your concerns are. Experimentation in bed is not a bad thing, but you need to be able to communicate at all times. Tell him, get his take, and move forward from there.

Women are generally weaker than men physically and a lot more willing to do physical things without investing emotion beyond the act. You likely felt helpless because you were helpless, you made it that way. You put all your trust in your partner and let a safe word be the only thing that stands between you and domination. That's really how it works.\n\nIf you and your boyfriend hadn't done it, he's still be exactly the same person he was now. You gained perspective from that session: 1) You're not as physically strong as you might have thought you were (totally fine, men deal with this realization all the time 2) You don't like BDSM and 3) Your boyfriend will set aside his comfort to make you feel loved\n\nSo therapy is a good call, because right now this is a you problem and you problems mean there is work to be done.",

Aftercare is the antidote to that \"high\" that can turn into this on the comedown.\n\nYou need to talk with him.  Let him hold you as you do, and make it clear it's not foreplay - specifically tell him that you want to discuss what happened.  Don't see this as a crisis, see it as an opportunity.\n\nYou're not mentally scarred.  You just tapped into a part of your sexuality that's unfamiliar and scary.  I won't purport to know what it's like for a submissively-inclined woman but I can speak semi-authoritatively as a submissively-inclined man that the first steps into this lifestyle are very emotionally and mentally taxing.\n\nYou're going to be fine.  I felt extremely vulnerable when I was at the stage you're in.  You worry that since you've given up control that you'll never get it back, or that you've opened some Pandora's Box that can't be closed again.  *It isn't like that*.  D/s porn (which NEVER shows aftercare) and how Hollywood portrays BDSM is untrue - they depict an unrealistic ideal.  You always have control, even if/when you surrender it.\n\nDo some reading.  That's the first thing I did in my discovery process and it really helped me build a healthy foundation.  Also, look up D/s munches in your area, so you can chat with more seasoned kinksters in an open, non-threatening environment.  Or just listen.\n\nYou might feel like a wreck, but I envy you.  You've taken the first step to claiming your own sexuality, and you don't get to experience that feeling more than a precious few times.  Be cautious, but don't be dismissive of it.

This may have triggered it in an unrelated way.\n\nAftercare is the most important part of BDSM, or any form of sexual activity, really.\n\nMy wife and I have a rule. If anyone needs to stop at any time, for ANY reason, just say it. Everything halts immediately and aftercare begins. Other times we just need to change what we're doing. We're not super rough but both have mental health issues we're working on. Sometimes, something 100% unrelated triggers and we need to stop.\n\nTalk about everything. You said he is very supportive and it sounds like you trust each other. Talking through this with him as well as your therapist is going to help you both immensely.\n\nTalk to your therapist about possible PTSD triggers. Talk to your boyfriend about how you feel and make sure he knows that he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nAlso, start slow and build to the heavier stuff with sex and keep in mind that aftercare typically is helping each other mentally come back down to your normal mindsets. This is especially important with BDSM or roleplay.",

      "text": "The thing with BDSM, depending on what you do, jumping straight into very rough things can end up being more detrimental than good because you need to learn *your* own boundaries. The feeling of being helpless can be panic-inducing for some to the point it isn't enjoyable.\n\nAlso, aftercare is very important and it isn't just a BDSM-exclusive thing. Cuddles, discussion, food, water, etc. because you may have also experienced \"sub drop\" without realizing it, especially if it felt good at the moment.\n\nI would recommend opening up to your boyfriend, especially if you are feeling unnerved by how aroused he was. Chances are, he was into it because you were into it... that's how most people are with their partners. If my partner isn't into something that I enjoy doing, the enjoyment of doing it is practically dead.\n\nAnd when going to therapy, I would recommend a kink friendly therapist. Therapists who aren't might end up making how you feel worse or give you negative ideas about BDSM or try to convince you that your boyfriend is secretly a predator or chastize you for trying something \"degenerate\".",

I would try and talk to him about this and be open about your feelings on it, but if you're not there yet that's ok to and you can work up to that in therapy and possibly attend some sessions together.\n\nAt the very least you can try telling your boyfriend something like \"hey I really appreciate how much you care for me, love and support me and are willing to experiment with me! I know I told you that I discovered the BDSM we tried wasn't really for me but ever since we played around with that it's really left me with some feelings that I need to work through for my mental health (and you can add that it's also for your relationship if you want to) so I'm going to find a therapist to go and talk it over with. I've just been feeling very _(insert feelings)_ and it's not your fault. I love you so much and I want to make sure that I'm the best partner I can be for you by taking care of myself.\"\n\nYou can even write him a note or letter if that's more comfortable for you. I'm not sure what you did obviously but it sounds like you may have started out a little bigger and or deeper (let's be mature here folks \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude05) than you should have and yoy may want to try smaller acts/steps/stages in the future.\n\nI have a friend who is very into some BDSM and rough play. I know for her a large part of the fact is that by surrendering she is in control of the situation, she's then one who can stop everything right away as well as setting the boundaries to begin with.\n\nBe kind to youself and be patient.as you figure out exactly what this knocked loose in your brain and try to  be as open as you can be with your partner. You may want to be very clear about how you want to proceed with intimacy going forward for the time being as you don't want to cause yourself more stress or trauma to have to unpack in therapy, epecially if it's at any physical contact.\n\nIt's ok, you tried something new, you didn't like it and it gave you some complex feelings about it. You're taking the right steps to help resolve it and it could help to make your relationship even stronger.\n\nBrains can be weird; but you can do this, even if it seems a lite scary. Be kind to yourself, you deserve it. Gentle hugs!",

Not that aftercare is a bad thing of course. It can be necessary for some, personally I\u2019ve never needed it, not even one iota. Idk that it would\u2019ve helped here. I think you just went too much too fast. The thing is I\u2019m not exactly sure what you should or could do from here on out- time is probably the only thing that\u2019s gonna help. I\u2019ve had purely vanilla sex give me a very similar thing to what you\u2019re talking about because it was early in the morning and I wasn\u2019t saying no or my safe word or even attempting to verbalize that I didn\u2019t like it because it was fine while it was happening but afterwards I felt violated. It wasn\u2019t logical. Only time and communication helped. Idk that it even really matters that much that it was rough or BDSM, it might just be that it pinged the area of your brain that said nonconsent despite your full knowledge that it was consensual. That\u2019s what happened to me simply because I was sleepy. Not asleep, not \u201cjust woke up\u201d just tired, he had zero way to tell I felt anything other than happy because like you said in the moment it felt good, physically. But a little voice in my mind wanted to say stop and could have but didn\u2019t. Just didn\u2019t. So it just took me a few months to sort of wrap my mind around that and convince my reptile brain that I was actually ok and never in danger. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAfter care isn\u2019t like a panacea that makes things our subconscious isn\u2019t ok with suddenly ok. It\u2019s kinda gaslighting to make this about that imo.",

You've got to let it all out in order to heal. Glad to hear that you've decided to tell your boyfriend!  \n\n\nPro tip, when discussing uncomfortable things with your partner, go with I statements not You statements. For example, I've been feeling anxious and withdrawn due to feeling uncomfortable about the BDSM we've done. I feel conflicted because I didn't enjoy it and know that you did. Due to that, I've been holding in that feeling and it's gotten to the point of distancing myself from intimacy. I know that it's not your fault but I didn't realize how traumatized I'd be after it. I may still avoid your touch as I heal from this just know that in no way am I doing it to hurt you. I just simply need to heal.   \n\n\nI statements help conversations remain calm and non-combative since the I statements clearly state what you're feeling, what caused the issue, and next steps. It's like a literal blueprint of how to help your partner help you. Good luck and wish you both happiness!",

It's very easy to get carried away and push the sub to far. Safe words are great and all, but a dom needs to see the signs that he is going to far as well. There are times (like this) where the sub doesn't know they are getting pushed beyond there limits. \n\nAnd I think this is more your bf needs to read up on how to be a good, safe dom. Because you can really physically and mentally hurt someone by going to hard in BDSM.\n\nTldr: read how to be a dom before you dom someone. Learn how to take care of a sub both physically and mentally.",

You feel like shit because your brain is being rewired and you're just getting used to something new.\n\nSo like, look at videos of deaf people hearing for the first time and see how overwhelmed they are. Eventually the brain gets used to it and it turns the negative experience of suddenly hearing things (which sounds loud) into a positive experience of being able to hear your loved ones say your name or tell you they love you, it's just a very human thing. Sex is also very human but unlike hearing most aren't either innately taught or assisted by machines. So even if your conscious mind can comprehend the situation for the brain itself it's a completely new scenario and it will build a pathway specifically for it. Like with most things the body builds it's a disturbance to the conscious host. Once everything is built you'll either feel super shitty or perfectly okay. Hoping for perfectly okay because you're just another human doing human things and nothing wrong with that.",

And it\u2019s a pretty human reaction to try something, and then realize you\u2019re not into it. It\u2019s worse in her case because it turned out to be pretty traumatizing to the point where he flinches to his touch. Obviously, she doesn\u2019t want to feel like this. But it\u2019s like a positive feedback loop of negative emotions that is really hard to break.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s had a traumatizing childhood, it\u2019s not uncommon to have conflicting feelings for loved ones. It can make wanting to talk to someone extremely difficult. You can tell yourself that you don\u2019t blame them at all, and that you love them no matter what. But from personal experience, you can\u2019t just undo the affects of trauma with communication alone. Therapy really does work wonders.\n\nAnyways, calling people who have gone through something traumatic monsters isn\u2019t cool.",

They offer teaching sessions.\n\nMight add I don't know shit about BDSM from my own experience, but had an old coworker I'm still friends with. He's hard into the scene and had my fair share of his stories. :)\n\nFor your BF  -  Man are as simple as they come. Just ask him and tell him how it was for you. Be open, be direct, be brutal. What you do right now is A LOT worse. Your denying of him will already give him the idea that he is responsible and somethings up and he will take it the wrong way, I can guarantee you that. \n\nEspecially with BDSM, openness is the most important thing. And also part of BDSM - to open yourself up, to tell something you wouldn't do otherwise, something that could hurt you. That makes you insecure.\n\nNot to mention - don't try to interpret or guess how he felt at that time and about it in general. Really. Never works. I'm sure he enjoyed it, but more because you enjoyed it too. Not because he was the master or whatever. Also you can switch the roles :)\n\nAnd he won't feel like a peace of shit, if you tell him, in the aftermath it simply overwhelmed you. Was nice, but it seems you're not really ready to not be in \"control\".",

You have nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about, just as he doesn\u2019t. But trying to force yourself to be fine so as not to hurt his feelings will just end up frustrating you both. Based on what you\u2019ve said, I have no doubt he\u2019ll be supportive and you can work through this thing both together and separately as needed. But the unspoken anxiety will lead to problems down the road. Far easier to accept and deal with a problem once it\u2019s out in the open.",

I've only scratched the surface, and I can tell you that it takes a lot of time, effort, and active trust building between the 2 of you. If done improperly or without care for one another, I've seen it ruin not only relationships but also the individual people.

After a scene the sub normally gets fussed and cared for, reassured they did good and other positive affirmation. This is good for the sub and the dom. It is often described as the dom picking up the pieces and putting the sub back together. It helps reaffirm the bond between the partners and shows the sub the dom cares and is looking after them. \n\nThis, I think , would've helped here. If you're looking to do bdsm again I'd strongly advise you chat to a few folk with experience to pick up the best practices in the community",

We might get a little selfish sometimes, and enjoy ourselves maybe a little bit too much, but I can guarantee that most guys derive a more satisfying enjoyment on getting off when they know that their partner is enjoying it just as much if not more.\n\nSecond, part of being in a relationship, really the major part of a relationship, is communication. While it may be your own doing, and not his fault, it's still worth telling him. Especially since it is affecting your relationship with him as a whole. Sometimes just airing it out can help mend the wound, rather than letting it Fester like an infection where it'll only get worse the longer you hold on to it. Explaining it out, like you did here, will also ease any edge of guilt or anger it might give him. Telling him you're the one who asked for it not him, and you don't blame him will keep him from justifying what you already know. Add to it saying you're just hoping airing it out in the open helps it heal will not only keep him from a defensive game and be more open to helping (not that I think that'll be an issue) but also give an understanding of motive and make it sting less. If he cares it'll hurt no matter, because we don't like to hurt those we care for but it can help lessen the blow.\n\nThirdly, if none of that helps you can always try it again but in reverse. Where you are in control and he would be the helpless one. Sometimes a full role reversal can help trigger the fix. The therapy is also a helpful option as you had mentioned.\n\nSorry for the ramble.\nThe best of luck and I hope things work out for the two of you. Sounds like you have a good man who's willing to support and help you in any way.",
