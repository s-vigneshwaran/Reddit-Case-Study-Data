The Shaman dude has matter of factly been found guilty of a crime but that doesn't mean said crime happened or the Tweeter thinks the crime happened. Just that they have been sentenced for an alleged crime.\n\nFor example many people take plea deals and try to bargain for better outcomes resulting in people de facto being sentenced for a crime that may not have actually happened nor did they actually do it. E.G the crime of murder happened but an innocent person is arrested for it and they manage to argue it down negligent manslaughter even though they're innocent because they'd get less years of prison. Said person was definitrly jailed for negligent manslaughter but that's not what happened and that's not what those campaigning for the release of the innocent person think.",

He gathered them at his house and came out with a box where they were supposedly enclosed. When he opened it to show them, they were all like, \"Uuuh... Where are they?\" and he berated them about how impious they were and forced them to pray for hours. Then when he went to show them again, they all pretended like the box contained the most extraordinary thing they'd ever seen.\n\nFucking priceless lmao",

Also, he walks at least 20-30km a day, often in soaking wet shoes).\n\n- Woman living in retirement residence who had a stroke fairly young (mid 40's), believed that her ex-husband and his girlfriend have been poisoning her specifically with chlorine gas.  Because of how disruptive she has been in that setting she has had to change residences a few times.  She believes her ex and his girlfriend have gotten new jobs every time she has had to move.\n\n- Any number of incoherent combinations of conspiracy claims centered around how people at high levels of government are tracking individuals who have no connections to other governments, critical industries or any real reason to be a concern.

Basically it boiled down to, the easy no-brainer charges are just the beginning, he got 3 years for traspassing but they haven't completed their investigation, more charges are definitely on the table. Getting these people processed and charged with lesser crimes ties their hands so they can sit tight and wait for the rest of their charges to be worked out. If they can throw them on probation or house arrest, prevent them from buying/ owning guns, make them check in and prevent them from traveling that's better than rushing the system and letting more of them fall through the cracks so they can organize again. \n\nI hope there is serious follow through on this. I don't want to see the government line these people up and execute them, but forgiveness is not an option either.  They are not patriots, they are traitors, plain and simple.",

He died at about 9:30 p.m. on Jan. 7. Although Diaz told the Washington Post that Sicknick suffered neither an allergic reaction to chemical irritants nor any injuries, he said \u201call that transpired played a role in his condition.\u201c\n\nThe medical examiner\u2019s office directly noted that the term \u201cnatural\u201d is \u201cused when a disease alone causes death\u201d and that \u201cif death is hastened by an injury, the manner of death is not considered natural.\u201d\n\n\nThey can\u2019t say because of privacy laws, but dude had an underlying condition.

Thank you so much!*\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jWJVMoe7OY0 \n\n18:15 window BREACHED when it was broken\n22:50 Major breach, Police line at door, outnumbered as per usual that day, breaks.\n\n  There were 8 breaches on the perimeter (breach means gap or hole in perimeter, you don't need c4 and AK74s to make a breach)\n\n  Some were made by force, in some police couldn't hold the line, in some they gave up, maybe out of a lack of morale (12 vs 300 is not a winning fight that leads men to feel brave) maybe ordered by their SOs who wanted to minimize their wounded, maybe out of sympathy fuck if i know.\n\n  Ockhams razor comes to mind here and i believe the first two require less leaps in thought but idk how far.\n\n\n>there is no scenario in which the capital police where not complicit\n\nFirst of all, what an absolutist thought, these ideas are the same used by MAGAs calling all BLM looters or terrorists.\n\nSecond, unless you're a proud boy, nancy pelosi or DC police you weren't there, i doubt you would have held the perimeter so heavily outnumbered for much longer.\n\nThird. I think this comes down to someone far FAR up higher in the chain of command, even the guy leading yhe police line was begging for more police on site, WSOs, etc. (Seen on the video i linked)\nIf someone was complicit, the people making the real damage weren't even there, they were inside some government building or command center, they wouldn't be there with a baton in their hands.",

He had broadband and a lot of storage for the time period. Instead of pirating movies and Playstation games himself, he offered ftp and fserve hosting for free and just let people upload directly to him. He had a script that would look at the file size of each account and if it was 600mb or larger he'd take a look. Anything less than that and the account was removed after a month or two to make room. Someone uploaded eight mpeg files around 40mb each that was CP. All of his equipment was seized by the FBI under the new Patriot Act.\n\nI considered it unjust that he was nailed for that but not the other scams he was running. There was an online bank startup at the time called x.com and when you opened an account you got $20 and if you referred someone, you got $10. He ran an email scam to gather personal information of people and opened accounts in thier names and took at the money.\n\nHe ran another scam site where you would setup a profile and enter the name and email address of the person you had a crush on. That person would get an email alerting them someone has a crush on them and to register, do the same and see if they match. Eventually someone couldn't figure out who the girl was and offered to pay $5 to find out. After that my cousin randomized the connections and raked in the cash.\n\nHe was an interesting character.",

Yes. Would billions of people die and civilazation as we know it evaporate in a matter of months without it? yes.\n\nDoes that make me a part of the problem because I don't say we need to completely eliminate petrol this instant? No..\n\n>you're saying that people should be allowed to con people,\n\nNo. I believe any human on earth has the right to express their beliefs and opinions, by sharing those opinions or beliefs with other people. In the event of FIRE! at a theatre it is obviously fraudulent, and we can put a stop to it, but when a demagogue says \"I think this particular vaccine is poison being administered for *whatever reason given*, then even if the reason given is fraudulent, it becomes impossible to really prove the demagogue knew so, and was acting in bad faith to rile some demographic. \n\nHow do you prevent with a law the demagogue from bad faith arguments without preventing fools from good faith nonsense arguments unless from education? \n\nAnd how, over long periods of time, generations, can you prevent good faith rules aimed to prevent bad faith arguments from preventing good faith arguments against bad faith demagogues?\n\nEDIT: a word",

I think the limit there is 3 year sentences, longer is served at the state facility.\n\nI\u2019ve just never thought about it, but my neighbor been arrested (warrants) like 4 times last year and each time it took place on a weekend. I know that was purposeful, they told me. He was being arrested due to violations of a restraining order, I\u2019m the victim. So that was all fine with me.\n\nBut it is unfair that all arrests end up being help for at least 24 hours, due to the sheer bureaucracy of bail.

I have no idea.  I don't know and am not going to look it up because it's irrelevant.\n\nYour argument is that moving away from cruel and unusual punishment in our prison system means turning the US prison system into a \"slap on the wrist\" is fallacious logic.\n\nOn top of that, it's this kind of need for vengeance that leads to military over-reaction like the Iraq war and drone warfare.

Locked up, yes, like all those charged for crimes. Just not in solitary.  \n  \nBut **why** he got locked up awaiting trial is right there in the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of my link:\n\n\"Chansley, who pleaded guilty to a felony charge of obstructing an official proceeding, **was among the first rioters to enter the building**. He has acknowledged **using a bullhorn to rile up the mob**, offering thanks in a prayer while in the Senate for **having the chance to get rid of traitors** and scratching out a threatening note to Vice President Mike Pence saying, \u201cIt\u2019s Only A Matter of Time. Justice Is Coming!\u201d  \n  \nThough he isn\u2019t accused of violence, prosecutors say Chansley, of Arizona, **was the \u201cpublic face of the Capitol riot\u201d** who **went into the attack with a weapon**, **ignored repeated police orders to leave the building** and **gloated about his actions in the days immediately after the attack**.\"  \n  \nSo he was among the first to breach the Capitol, carried a weapon (his flag-spear) into both the riot AND the Capitol, stirred up his fellow rioters, prayed in gratitude for the chance to 'get rid of traitors' (with all associated implications left unspoken), left a note to the Vice-President threatening him with violence and/or death, ignored repeated Capitol police instructions to vacate the building AND he was so unrepentant about it as to gloat on social media about everything he did.",

And if these people really cared about justice for all, everyone should be outraged. But they don't. They only care about punishing all the Maga crowd as much as they can. There was a teenager that got drunk and killed four pedestrians in a crash. He got probation. He KILLED FOUR PEOPLE and got probation. He was the affluenza teen. This guy walked into the capital building, messed around, and walked out and got 3 1/3 years. Justice for all? No way.",

Don't know whose fault was that and i really don't understand what happened but that does not matter now. \n\nthe only person said to have died on jan 6 because of the riot was Ashli Babbit according to your own linked article (the others that died did so of natural causes or overdose). We can argue about the suicides of the cops that happened some days later but at the day of the riot only Ashli Babbit.",

Both groups also qualify as terrorists according to the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations: \"*the unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives*\".\n\nThe January 6th crowd that breeched the Capitol was literally trying to coerce an entire branch of the U.S. government to overturn an election based on claims that over a year later still can't be backed up by any actual evidence whatsoever. This should not be minimized regardless of one's political viewpoints. At least if you actually care about democracy.",

There are a number of debates we could have on any of these topics but BLM isn't Congress. BLM isn't the Democratic party. Mike Pence isn't BLM. The riots over the summer of 2020 are not in any way the same as an attempt to overthrow an election. There is no equivalency. None.
