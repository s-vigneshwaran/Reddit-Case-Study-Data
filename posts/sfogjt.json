We aren't losing forest, we are maintaining the same amount of forest and regrowing. \n\nUnsustainable clear cutting does happen (I.e Brazil has been cutting and burning forests for farmland a ton recently), but with regards to producing sustainable lumber, silviculture has been doing this for decades.",

I live in the western states and have worked as a firefighter, both structural and wildland. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLogging companies are required to replace trees they cut with reprod (baby trees), and often areas that are logged aren't hit as bad by wild fires. I was working a fire that used an old logging road, and the thinned out area as a \"natural\" fire break to help stop a push up the hill. Responsible logging that includes land management is the norm here, and it's really not any less profitable than any other method. Most companies grind up the wood they can't use a lumber to sell as wood chips, fuel for wood pellet stoves, and other things. A well maintained forest INCLUDES logging. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWorst fire I was ever on, that included a fatality was in an old growth region that hadn't been logged or managed for almost a century. The environmental groups had fought to keep it \"untouched\" so the underbrush wasn't cleared out by smaller fires, which are beneficial for forest health and growth. Some trees need fire to reproduce actually. The fire burned so hot in the undergrowth, that it crowned and burned or killed many many trees that otherwise would have been fine had the fire just been a growth fire through a well maintained forest. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nComing in and logging forests helps keep them healthy, and of course it needs to be done correctly, but to run around saying \"logging makes fires worse\" is fucking ignorantly wrong, and someone should probably punch themselves in the face before saying that dumb ass shit again.",

The difference is that proper (indigenous) land management included burning too, which served as fuel reduction as you mention.  Modern logging usually leaves a bunch of slash and shit all over the ground. Recent incidents show logged land burning significantly hotter than otherwise. \n\nhttps://www.opb.org/article/2020/10/31/logging-wildfire-forest-management/",

I'm adding to that and saying while that might be best,it realistically won't happen. People are dependent on what they take on truth. You don't check three sources for the weather, or a recipe, or what's going on in another country, or whats going on in the white house. Most choose one source and call it a day.  And they can't hold all the blame for that. They trust the sources they choose. That trust being abused to push a media sources side on a matter is an entirely diffrent issue. \n\nIf you were to follow a media source that was more neutral and did both pros and cons on this topic then you'd be More informed yes. But if you are following one source that heavily leans to one side then you too will also lean to that side. Becuase you agree with what you trust as fact. And telling the people to \"look it up\" would be like me telling a normal person to look up flat up theory because there's some genuine science there that can make them question if the Earth is flat. Or to tell a flat earther there is science for a round earth. Neither party will bother. You are wasting there time over something both would consider dumb to do. They trust that what they were taught is true and trust the sources that taught them that and not so much info or media contrary to their own. \n\nAnd no I'm not saying teach the consumer to be aware of media that leans towards anything and try to remain neutral. I'm saying that you can't change how those people are Becuase the system of media is the way it is now. It's Becuase media has bias that we must use multiple sources to verify the full truth of a matter.  But many people don't do that Becuase media ,as a business,  doesn't profit if you aren't giving them your full trust and confidence. You can't change the system. And I never said you could. I'm saying you'd have to change the system for people to be 100 percent responsible for the bias on a matter. \n\nAbd to your final response the internet is full of billions of opinions of which anyone and everyone is allowed to express. I am at liberty to express my opinion on a public forum as much as you are at liberty to just call me an idiot and not respond.  You don't want to \"debate\" when I was just adding to your words...then why keep responding? If you don't want to talk then don't. You weren't attacked and neither was I. You were just a dude with an opinion to me until you decided to make it a focus on me as a person instead of the media consumption and knowledge of sustainable lumber practices of \"big lumber\" as you put it.",

They still don\u2019t generally clear cut land in the US, and they do plant saplings afterwards, but it still isn\u2019t great.

Hardwood floors, cabinets, siding, roofing, paneling etc. could more than double the number of trees needed to complete the home. In total, building a home today will consume forty-four mature trees for every 2600 square feet. Be sure to include the garage when adding up your square footage.\"\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.homepreservationmanual.com/how-many-trees-to-build-a-house/amp/\n\nSay approx 500,000 homes are built in a year. That's 22,000,000 treas a year. That's just the number of houses in the united states. A tree takes upwards of 30 years to grow.\n\nFurthermore, to repair a home, you need... You guessed it. More wood.\n\nNow, you can improve upon a technology that can grow concrete using bacteria that can regrow and repair itself, all using photosynthesis.\n\nWhat seems like the best option?\n\nEdit 2:\n\"Roughly 15 billion trees are cut down each year, the researchers estimate; since the onset of human civilization, the global number of trees has dropped by roughly 46%.\"\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18287#:~:text=Roughly%2015%20billion%20trees%20are,has%20dropped%20by%20roughly%2046%25.\n\nTheir are roughly 3 trillion trees in the world. 15 billion are cut every year. It takes a tree 30 years to mature. It's not hard to fathom, that using trees as shelter, is unsustainable, and we can easily outpace the number of trees that grow.\n\nAnd with population exponentially increasing and demand for shelter goes up, that number will only increase.\n\nEdit 3: 15 billion trees a year * 30 years = 450 billion trees.\n\nIn the mean time, in those 30 years, only 15 billion trees are just reaching their maturity.",

Alot of new ideas and potential medications are discarded be because of their inefficacy, or the danger of using them. In the end though, the medications that are successful, have the potential to save lives.\n\nAs these medications are mass produced and used more, it drastically reduced the price of them because they now know how to make them, so no more need for RND and clinical trials. They also find a more efficient way of making them.\n\nIf you don't put the effort into development of a technology that is more sustainable than cutting down forests, then we would never be more sustainable.\n\nThe logic here shouldn't be \"trees give us shelter. Why mess with success?\"\n\nSame concept as \"if internal combustion gets me from one place to another, why do I need an electric vehicle?\"\n\nTrees are not very sustainable.

The word was *tekton* which, in Ancient Greece, didn't mean exactly the same thing as carpenter does now. \nIt specifically meant a skilled worker of wood.  It's similar to how a smith is someone works with metal but that could be anything from a goldsmith to a blacksmith.  While those are both smiths, the general sort of work done can be significantly different.\n\nSimilarly a tekton could have meant anything from a builder of homes to someone who made sculptures from wood for various purposes, typically religious.  While the idea that a Jewish man would have been making pagan statuary is a bit of a stretch, that's still a possible meaning of the word.\n\nIt's also entirely possible that a tekton would have been the ancient equivalent of a handyman.  We simply have no way of knowing which context was meant, considering the lack of details in the texts we have.\n\nNot that I'm saying the Twitter guy was correct, since I don't have the thread.  It's entirely possible, however, for that to have been the case.  It's important to keep this sort of thing in mind when dealing with ancient texts that have been translated.",
