It does not matter now how easy it was for him to dominate the woman you longed and chased after for so long. \n\nThe one you loved is the one he defiled, and to  add insult to injury, your grandmother wants you to have children now, so that they may immediately have children by 15 or so. Just in time for your grandmother to spoon one last bite of oatmeal in her mouth, and take a picture with her great-granddaughter and granddaughter (now 16). All in the hopes of breeding more females to give births young and more males to simp the world up by storm. \n\nBecause as this man will tell you being a simp means being in pain. The simpage and pain that shows on this face is like the erosion of the environment by climate. \n\nEyes are heavy like an overworked Uber driver who has a car, potential passengers, but no foreseeable destination. Ultimately there is no GPS ingrained in being a human for this kind of despair. \n\nBrb",
