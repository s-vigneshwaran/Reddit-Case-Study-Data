We exchanged numbers and chatted each other up but then I had to return home for my 20 minute 4:00 am nap. I was planning on going back after to invite her back home later.

I was laying in the bed and eventually realized I missed a \u201cyou still up\u201d text from her, probably like 20-30 minutes.

When the time comes to get busy, it'll come out in the context it's meant to, and yeah, at that moment 5\" is going to seem far from tiny for her. \n\n...Unless she's the kind of chick who's always rocking herself with a huge dildo or something. Never know. She might be expecting a massive dong because you did the tiny dick play. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (But if she's riding table legs in her spare time that's not really your fault.)",

It acknowledges you like her in that position but doesn\u2019t put pressure on anything to happen which usually means more happens. Girls seem to love the play fighting / what next move so I\u2019ve used that line a bit and it hasn\u2019t failed me.\n\nIt\u2019s a good balance line for both girls that want the guy to be aggressive or girls that want things to go more gentle but still want to fool around. Usually the next line the girl says will let you know which one she is and just give her what she wants. Or I guess if she\u2019s neither and wants to stop but usually if you\u2019ve made it to the \u201cwhat next\u201d step you\u2019re past that.\n\nThanks for coming to my Ted talk.",

          "text": "Was at a sleepover at my buddy's house, watching a movie and this super hot girl offers to share her blanket with me, at which point she places her hand on my thigh and is just once every 69 seconds moving it an inch closer to my dick. It was way more erotic than I'm making it sound.\n\nI was so nervous that I stood fully chubbed up, asked my buddy to step into the other room with me. I whisper-yell something along the lines of \"bro she has her hand on my thigh she's gonna touch my dick, what do I do??\"\n\nI was a virgin at the time in my defense, but I have no idea what answer I was looking for, to be honest I think I just kinda pussied out lmao.\n\nAnyway I look behind me and the girl in question is peeking her head around the corner to eavesdrop on what I was saying, justifiably so I'd say.\n\nI look back at my buddy, who looks at her and says \"were you touching my buddy's dick?\"\n\nNo idea why he would say such a thing, purely out of reflex and embarrassment I punched him in his arm. Long story short I embarrassed the shit out of her and she wanted nothing to do with me afterward. Her friend asked her if it was true and she said \"No! I was pinching his leg!!\" Which thankfully for me was a weak lie to tell, no one believed it. \n\nShe was so beyond out of my league, I live in confusion and regret about it, but it actually makes me feel better that there are people like you who were similarly nervous, thanks for sharing lmao.\n\nEdit 1: [Here's a (censored) picture of the girl I found on Facebook so you can feel my regret](https://youtu.be/iik25wqIuFo)\n\nEdit 2: I was reminded of a few details I forgot to add. I appreciate all of your stories! They're real fun to read, and like I said it helps me feel a little less remorseful about it.\n\nEdit 3: The movie was Devil, horror movie set entirely in an elevator where the lights will go out and someone in the elevator dies, and one of the people in the elevator killed them, but nobody knows who it was and they're all crammed in that small space. (Spoilers, it was the Devil)",

So the show ends and I ask her if she wants to come back to my hotel, fully expecting her to say yes, and she just casually says no, and we say our goodbyes. If I would have been a little younger and pussied out, I would, to this day, think I ruined my chances with her. But the reality was that it never was going to happen.

From my understanding she put her hand on his leg, which isn't creepy in it of itself. It could totally be passed off as a friendly gesture, like how friends put their arm around your shoulder while watching a movie. But I assume when she started moving her hand closer to him, and when he wasn't expressing discomfort or asking her to stop, the girl was probably oblivious to the fact that he was totally nervous and kept going. In a hypothetical situation where he didn't want to be touched and maybe looked at her weird, moved her hand away, or asked her to stop, she would get the memo and stop. Tbh it's kind of iffy with these things but when there aren't any drugs involved, it's just harmless flirting or exploration imo. Plus this just sounds like an awkward interaction between two young people who are still new to intimate stuff lol. The guy panicked and tried to ask his buddy for advice, which mixed with his nervousness maybe came off as alarming and caused his friend to defend him like that is what im assuming happened. I'm so sorry if im wrong about this but thats the overall vibe I got from this story",

I had a super secret crush on her for a couple of years but never bothered to do anything because that's just how I be. We both had a pretty similar sense of humor, and we were also good enough friends that I felt comfortable enough with her to start pushing some flirtatious boundaries and see what would happen.    \n \nWell, fast forward through the night and we have gradually gotten VERY frisky with each other. We are both outside in the cold smoking, and she says \"my nipples could cut glass!\" I said \"I don't believe you.\" Then she straight up pulled her top up and told me to feel them. As a gentleman, I obviously complied. Results were quite conclusive, they could indeed cut glass.   \n\nFast forward some more and the night is winding down. She's got her arms around me, and she says \"so, are you taking me home tonight?\" And that was when my inner George Costanza came out. I dead ass said to this beautiful woman \"Ahhh, sorry, I rode here with friends, I don't think there's enough room in the car.\" She chuckled and thought I was joking, but my dumb ass brain did not make the connection. When she realized I was not joking she slinked away from me and called an Uber. Now, you might be thinking, \"this was obviously a sealed deal, what the hell were you thinking?\" and my answer to that is: I have no idea. \n\n\nI went home, played XCOM 2 because it just came out, and when I woke up the next morning I realized what I had fucking done and to this very day it still terrorizes me. Some of us are really too stupid for our own good and I'm absolutely one of them.  \n\n\nSidenote,  XCOM 2 was pretty fun.",

This particular location has a big outdoor area for smoking (people mostly went out here to hang out around a fire and smoke weed). I ran out of my cigarettes and noticed this cute girl nearby who happened to smoke the same exact brand. So I approached her and asked if I could borrow a smoke. She said sure.   \n\n\nAs the night went on me and her started chatting each other up like crazy. We started talking about all sorts of things, ranging from the themes of Ghost in the Shell to how to get power armor early in Fallout 1 and 2. She was a turbo nerd and that was awesome. Eventually we started talking about sex, kinks, and fetishes. Turns out she is full on dominatrix and I just so happened to be the perfectly submissive and breedable sub to her. Something flipped a switch in her brain that made her want to dig her claws into me and fuck me silly. Absolutely no lingering doubt whatsoever. She wanted to abduct me and fuck me until we couldn't walk anymore. However, I was VERY apprehensive. I had no idea who this girl was, like, at all, and the whole casual sex thing never interested me. Hell, as far as I knew this girl just wanted to harvest a kidney from me or some shit. I just wanted to talk about Evangelion god dammit.  \n \n\nSo, she wanted me to dance with her. Like, REALLY dance with her. Just get up all on her shit and go crazy. I am not much of a dancing person, so I told her no, it's not really my thing. She got VERY ANGRY. She slapped me. At first I thought it was like...a playful enticing dom slap. So I laughed and told her she'll have to do it harder. She did it harder, then pulled my ear towards her mouth and said \"you don't know a good thing when you fucking see it\" and then she walked away. In hindsight I am actually very glad I did not get involved with this psycho, but on the other hand...it could've been fun just the one time, but very unlikely it would have been worth it.  \n\nAfter this situation, I came to the conclusion that if a strange, pretty girl goes from 0 to 100 with their interest in you, they are most definitely crazy and should be avoided at all costs.",

Right around that time I started getting seriously invested in some personal hobbies and basically killed my social life to pursue them. Was absolutely worth it. I used to go out with my friends pretty much all the time, but I got tired of it. For about 5 months I was full blown extrovert but I think that burned out my batteries for good. I've been perfectly content just being a high-functioning recluse since then. I go to work, I come home, I voice chat with the squad, hang out with them IRL...it's nice.  \n\nAnother thing I disliked about going out all the time was my friends basically put this huge amount of pressure on me to just go and fuck. I didn't want anything to do with that. I enjoyed meeting new people and getting to know them, but no matter how many times I told them I didn't want to fuck random strangers they kept trying to get me to do it. It was honestly pretty fucking weird. I gotta have some kinda connection first, like, I need to actually LIKE someone before I can even begin to feel comfortable getting that intimate with them. My friends back then did not really understand that or even get it. My current friends do. Surrounding myself with positive people who genuinely want to support me was probably the best thing I've ever done for myself.",

He eagerly started helping her in sorting out her laundry and she didn't seem too fazed about him separating her under garments and everything. Suddenly she asked him if she can strip and put her clothes in the washer as well. He started laughing, asking her \"what she'd be wearing meanwhile?\"\n                        And then it suddenly dawned on him what she really wanted...so he ran back inside and fetched a large bathing robe that someone had left before from one of the backrooms and asked her to go inside and change so that she can wash ALL her clothes at once without having to come again or anything. Then he went back behind the register while she awkwardly stood there alone wearing only the bathing robe for half an hour waiting for the cycle to get over...",

              "text": "So I worked at Kroger with a girl who, was beyond extremely attractive. Problem was I was 20 and she was 17. I know I \"technically\" would be fine, but in no good conscience would I so much as do more than say hi and talk.\n\nAnyways, she flirty non-stop with me and I'm so naive and suffering from extremely poor self image issues (which I still do) I'm not thinking anything more than she's being friendly and complimenting me. Not to long after she turns 18 and her being flirty intensifies to her coming out of her way to be on my bagging station, hugging me in aisles where it's just the two of us, definitely giving flirty eyes, etc. She actually asks for my number, which shocked me, it had been 2 years since anyone shown any interest in me.\n\nShe would send me pictures and texts all the time asking about me and getting to know me. I figured she was trying to be friendly and wanted a friend. Well, the texts get more flirtatious and the pictures showed a bit... More. Nothing nude, but definitely could tell she wasn't a fan of clothing at home. Asked me if this dress looked good for a date she had planned. Proceeded to show me a dress and in her reflection I see her in her underwear. I got embarrassed and said yes the dress looks great. Proud moment there \n\nShe still doesn't give up. I'm starting to pick up vibes (finally, right?) that she's liking me, AFTER someone else points out how much time she's been taking in the meat room with me. At night. Just the two of us. I'm keeping it pg in case I'm wrong and she's just happy to have a friend. She cornered me one day in the meat room. And was definitely rubbing up on me grabbing me by my waist. Looking up at me. Basically throws my hand on her ass. She unfortunately got called up front at that moment. Let's just say there was more than one hard salami in that room. This happens three times that week, even my dumbass can't miss my hands on her ass. It escalated to the point of her pushing me up against a table and giving me a hickey and the best kiss I've ever gotten. Unfortunately, more interruptions.\nWell, I leave Kroger shortly after for other reasons. I'd still text her and definitely knew each other well, but nothing beyond a nude or some sexual texts. One day she's outside with me. At my car. She says I'm cold and shoves my hand up her shirt to warm her boobs up. Under the bra. What do I do when I have a girl so attractive that even being near her gave me a hard on and wanted me to fondle her boobs? Nothing. I pussied out. Literally was so shy I chickened out after having missed signals for a year. Still haunts me.\n\nWe're still friends, but the touching is at hug level and she's got a boyfriend. Sorry for the length, just haven't told anyone in the last 5 years.",

I'm not sure she would even remember the event, but if she did it's purely out of embarrassment and not out of a missed opportunity with me lmfao. Last I heard she had come out as bisexual. \n\nOne time we were in a Wal-Mart with her sister who was going through chemo (and who my buddy was dating) at the time, so she had no hair. She was extremely funny and light hearted about it though, there was a long line at the register and she just went \n\n\"EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, I HAVE CANCER I DONT HAVE TIME TO WAIT IN LINES I COULD BE DEAD TOMORROW\"\n\nlooking back I can't help but feel it was a douche kinda thing to do, but it was funny as hell, most of all because it worked, they stepped aside and she bought her stuff and we left.",

Generally you wanna comment in the first 24 hours of a post. If it's a good comment you want a lot of people to see You'll want to comment while the post is still young so you don't get buried by the other commenters.\n\nI appreciate that you hated the Rick Roll though, that's what it's there for lmao",

She puts her hand on my thigh and goes \"what's this?\" So the whole room hears it. There is snickering but she doesn't move it. She inches closer and closer and I'm rock hard. She grabs my dick and I immediately put my hand between her legs. I lost my virginity at 14 so knew what was up. I fingered her the entire movie. She told everyone that night.

In my defense I just couldn\u2019t believe it, and we\u2019d eaten some chips she said would make our breath smell bad or somethin, but.. bro, come on.

We were talking about whatever and out of nowhere she tells me to make a peace sign with both hands and then interlock the two \u201cV\u2019s\u201d (like my hands are scissoring each other). So I do it and am wondering why she asked me to and she said it\u2019s supposed to be the girth of your dick. Then she wraps her hand around my fingers and has a bit of shocked face, blushes and just grins at me. I then took me hands (fingers still interlocked), look at them quizzically and say \u201cno way\u201d.",

I don't know why I thought to say something that's practically me blurting out \"I got small willy\", but she plays along and asks \"Well is it true?\". And as one to not back down from my mistakes I end the conversation with \"Well it depends on what you consider small\". \n\nShe's now my GF btw, but we haven't gotten to the point where we talked to each other about sex and stuff. I'm still wondering if she remembers what I said and if it will affect her reaction if we ever fuck or if she just asks me about how big I am.",

A texting code or something.\u201d She was twenty something, way hot and had no reason to be hitting on my crusty, old ass, so I thought she was just being friendly, but she seemed to be paying a lot of attention to me and touched my arm at one point. Later, I looked up DDLG and was like, Shit! I still think about it.",

Then I got talked to by the Vice principle and it was this big mess. I told her about it and she didn\u2019t even remember so I guess I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut.

It just made me think 'OMG WHAT IS HAPPENING?!' And I just liked her from there.\n\nI will not try to be her boyfriend or something like that because it seems she likes my friend and I wouldn't dare get in their way, I mean my friend has a chance to get a gf and I'm gonna get in ma boi's way?!

Three different guys told me they had a huge crush on me all through HS.  I never knew. None of them ever asked me out on a date - not to a movie, not to a school function, nothing.  In fact, I hardly dated anybody in HS.  Definitely no one in my class - a couple of guys from other schools. So I was shocked to hear this revelation. Missed opportunities. Why? Insecurity? Shyness? Fear of rejection? Youth? Why is it you hear about these crushes 20 years later? 20 years too late?",

We get in and I immediately started challenging them to hold your breath contest, doing a handstand, etc missing ALL of their advances (real obvious ones too).  The ladies picking up that I wasn\u2019t catching on to their hints remembered I mentioned I had a puppy with me at my room and asked to come to my room to see him and my room wink wink etc etc. So we go up to my spot, and I tell them to wait outside right quick (because I\u2019m not trying to introduce everybody to everybody). I check on Rambo and he\u2019s fast asleep so I come back out and tell them sorry he\u2019s asleep and waking him up would be rude, high fived both the chicks and thank\u2019d them for a dope time and told them to be safe going back to their spots. Went inside and started munching on some ramen, and it was at that moment I knew. . . I fucked up. lol",

Nothing! \nI think i was too nervous or something.\nShe even said she was cold while we were in bed (trust me it was really warm in my room that day)\n\nThe best part a few years later i spoke with a female friend of her and she told me that she liked me back, but gave up after some time\n\nIf any girl reads this, we boys are idiots, if you like us tell us and never give up",

I had a new year's party one year and we all slept in my basement that night.  I happened to have a king size mattress on the floor and me and the girl laid on it together.  We fell asleep well apart from each other, but I woke up middle of the night and she had scooched all the way over to cuddle/seek warmth.  I didn't want her to freak out when she woke up thinking I was a creep for being on top of her, so I moved further to the edge.  I have horrible insomnia, so I woke up again and found her again scooched all the way up against me.  Same thought process happened and I moved over more.  Repeat one more time and I wake up in the morning basically hanging off the bed and her right up next to me.  I told her what happened, we had a good laugh,  she said she doesn't remember doing that, but was sad I tried to escape.  She told me not to try and escape next time.",

I simply got into bed with him, which was I think a solid 2m wide. Anyways, I still had some mdma kicking and a craving for human warmth, while he was just on beer. I smooched over to his side, luckily he got the hint and wrapped me in his arms. We spent the whole night just cuddling, most wholesome night in my life (I don't remember going into deep sleep but I woke up energized as if I had an 8h sleep).\nThroughout the night I was hesitant whether I should go for a kiss or not, and I think (or It seemed) that he was in the same state too hah. Anyways I didn't go for it fearing for it to turn into full sexual intercourse (wasn't ready for it back then). The guy is now one of my dearest friends and I don't think of him that way anymore.\nBut man, that night is the only reason I want to be in a relationship, just for 15min cuddles before sleep (don't feel bad for me I'm a commitment-phobic vincel).",

For me, my friend (now my wife) asked me to come study with her, and then when there was a snow storm starting, she said \u201comg you have to stay over\u201d, but I insisted I leave immediately not to miss the last train home\u2026 I deeply regretted ignoring all those signs on my way back home. Lucky enough the exact same thing happened the next day, and at that time I decided to \u201crisk it\u201d.\n\nYou have to consider nowadays that when women give subtle messages, a guy can fear that he\u2019s misinterpreting the situation. If the girl wants to expedite things, she should ignore old traditions of guy making first move and just do it. I\u2019ve know many girls in my teen years that would lead you on but were ultimately not interested. Determining which one it is can be difficult, and if you mess up it can dent the friendship significantly.",

Then also that some signs were given at the wrong times which not only made me misinterpret them, but due to my awkward nature I sometimes responded unintentionally rude.\n\nOne girl (arround 2011) decided to initialize something through facebook messenger. But at time it was really easy for me to miss those, so I only saw it somewhere in 2016 when she was suggested as a \"someone I might know\" in messenger as she apparently deleted me...\n\nAnother struggle I had was when a girl who I liked (she was 15, I 14) turned down another guy his request to dance. She said that she really wanted to dance with me. (It was a slow dance)\n\nI did dance with her, but all I could think of was how embarassing it would be to get a boner, so I kept my distance during the dance. Thinking about avoiding a boner resulted in me slowly getting a boner. So while she got closer, I again widened the space a bit, which made it seem like I wanted to be away from her.",

We talk a bit, laugh a bit and she says she ows me for helping her. She touches my arm, my hip, smiles at me and asks If i wanna join them! I said I couldn't because - studying! So she asks \"what now, then?\" Her friend (m) who tried to help us says \"Well, how bout exchanging numbers..?!\" \n\nIdiot me thought he meant him and me, and i answered \"nah, i'm good, thanks!\" and walked away wishing them a good evening! \n\nNot even 5 min later it dawned on me and i seriously thought about sprinting back!

We weren\u2019t in an official relationship or anything\u2026 trying to keep it \u2018chill\u2019. I got a couple interesting snapchats, her and her best friend (also super hot and older) going shopping and coming out with a big ole freezer bag of rubbers. Well the one I slept with invited me over when her parents were gone, I show up and her bff is there too. We basically just hung out (really pretty awkward) but then we put a movie on (that all of us had already seen, + 7 awkwardness). Keep in mind we\u2019re watching the movie in this girls\u2019 bed. Well the girl couldn\u2019t keep her hands off me and I was so concerned, I mean it felt so rude when her best friend was sitting in the same bed! Little did my innocent brain know, but she was trying her best to initiate a 3 way\u2026 \nIf I\u2019d have known then what I know now\u2026",

Brain is like a muscle, it must be trained and warmed up before it ramps up the power output. If we are caught by surprise by something unexpected, the most common response is a  clueless \"duh?\" even among geniuses lol.\n\n If a teenager boy with at least a little bit of experience is focused on his love interest and she gives an hint, he will probably get it. The problem is that all the situations described above happened to unexperienced young teens, or started unexpectedly in a relaxed context were the male partner was unfocused or, worse, already focused on something else (movie, videogame, etc).\n\nMy suggestion to teenager girls would be to engage a boy in a conversation before sending subtle clues. This way, his attention will be on the partner at least. It happens even to married couples, not just to teenagers. Mental focus can be very low during routine activities. \n Tickling  him out of the blue can be funny and sharing silly moments is a good thing, but it doesn't work very well as a clue if that is the goal.",

There is so much pressure to not be \"that guy\". I've been married almost 14 years, and I STILL have problems with expressing my feelings and wants/desires where they relate to sex. Like... If you've ever been with someone for awhile and think to yourself \"man, I kinda wanna try 'x' sexual thing\" (whatever it is. I'm not here to kink shame)... Like, the \"normal\" thing to do is, talk about it, right? I have spent MONTHS thinking about shit before bringing it up, so afraid of coming across as a creepy pervert disgusting man, eventually convincing myself that I am that. Like... Therapy and stuff has helped a little with that, and the fact that my wife is basically like \"yeah sure\" almost every time helps, and I've told her what goes on in my head and stuff.. But God damn does that shit have me fucked up sometimes.\n\nWhen you're a teenager or inexperienced, there is a metric TON of anxiety in these kinds of interactions as well. Not only is there so much \"men are pigs\" stuff out there, but there is also massive amounts of pressure to perform. Like... \"What if I suck? She'll tell all her friends about it and then everyone is gonna know that I didn't last for four hours and that means I'm really bad at sex.\"\n\nShit... The first time someone other than me touched my dick, we were making out and fondling and stuff for like..I don't know... Half an hour? I had so much anxiety, even when she made all the moves, that I didn't even get hard.",

Sometimes you feel what seems to be mutual attraction but in my experience women are better at just ignoring it or behaving like it isn't there. \n\nAn important point i haven't seen addressed in this thread is: Because I've been horny for things that are clearly not appropriate, we men get horny and we *know* we aren't seeing things clearly. So when I'm horny I don't trust my instincts. \nFor instance a teacher that is nice to you and makes you horny for her, or a friend, or your mother's friend...we *know* rationally that these are not real scenarios but your horniness takes the best of you.  You are full of hormones you just can't control it and you just can't trust yourself. So we learn to ignore the sexual impulses because they are so frequent and  inadequate that when they are real we can't tell them apart. \n\nLater in life when you have sex regularly things are different and relationships are more normal. This is a big part of why many women consider that men get better when they are more mature IMO.",

Like they don't necessarily have anything to do with each other at first glance. Honestly my girlfriend only tickles me now as a punishment when she's not impressed with one of my jokes because she knows I'm sensitive to it.\n\nMy first experience of this was that I just changed into a new extended science class for high school, and was really shy. Someone asked me if I liked this particular girl there (while she was in the row of seats behind me). And I was like \"ahhh... no?\" since I hardly knew her at all, and it's not like she asked me directly (and I honestly wasnt mature enough anyway). I though the guy wanted to know my opinion, rather than that he was asking for her. I feel bad that I hurt her feelings by answering like I did though.\n\nThe other one I suspect was that one of my closest high school friends recently came out as gay. In hindsight there were a couple of things we did that make me think he had a crush on me. Like he was insistent on watching 50 shades this one time for some reason, and we played a multi player game called lovers in a dangerous space time quite a lot for a bit. But in my defence, he was really conservative at the time, getting baptised as a young adult, and I had to tell him of when he used the word gay as an insult at my gay uncles' house when we slept over there. And there's also the fact that we're both kinda weird and so him doing a few weird things want really out of the ordinary.",

Her friend went home and when it was time to go to bed she said that I could sleep in her room to which I replied \"No, this is fine\" and slept on the couch.   Next day we and a big group of her friends spent the day out and about for her birthday and went to a friend's house for a party...she ended up hooking up with a guy that she was introduced at the party and started dating.",

Something like \"am I reading this right?\" or \"I feel like I'm picking up some signals\". A lot of women, like men, just want to know that the person we desire also desires us. But we're taught that we're not ALLOWED to initiate, so we have to wait for the guy. Which makes it all the more frustrating when we have these missed signals.

          "text": "Not thinking at all in my case. \n\nExamples, cute girl I was talking to in the night club was cosying up to me and complimented me. Didn't register at all and I went to the bar to some friends who just showed up.\n\nAnother night I was out and hit it off with a girl and we were kissing by the end of it. Around 2 in the morning, some people were going back to a house for a few more drinks but I said I needed to go home and she said the same so I offered to walk her home. We were walking past my house and I pointed it out to her, she stopped up and started kissing me again. My thinking was probably just that it was time to get her home and tried to stop kissing her but she started again. I can't remember what was said but all was in my head was that I said I'd walk her home. I think she must have felt I was rejecting her at some stage and went off in a huff. I'm sure all I had to do was invite her in and it would have lead to sex. I know because she went on to have a one night stand with a friend of mine and was told it was \"payback\". Ultimately I feel like I dodged a bullet.\n\nThere are others but last one I'll type out is a lot more complicated. Myself, my girlfriend and another girl, (mutual friend for a long time but I know her longer) we'll call her Jane, were drinking at our apartment. Hadn't seen each other for a while so we were just catching up. My girlfriend wanted me to go out so she could catch up with Jane. I had a long week of work and didn't want to go out and just wanted to chill out with a few drinks. She started being nasty when she wasn't getting her way it lead to her actually pushing me off a chair. Our relationship was a bit rocky at the time but I was shocked and furious that she treated me like this so left the room and ended up getting so worked up I cried in the bathroom. She came in a bit later completely unapologetic so I shouted at her, called her a bitch and told her to get away from me. Afterwards I got undressed and went to bed.\n\nA little later Jane came into the room. I was still really upset and pissed off but she hugged me and comforted me and she said that she had been fighting with her boyfriend as well. I have had feelings for her for a long time at this stage but she has had the same boyfriend the entire time so I had resigned myself to this fact years before. Here's where it gets confusing. She's sitting at the side of the bed around 1am at this stage. She eventually told me to push over in the bed so she could get in, something she had never done before and bear in mind I'm only wearing underwear so it was strange to me. I had calmed down a bit but the adrenaline was still pumping and couldn't relax. We continued to talk, Jane lying on her side and had put her hand on my shoulder or chest at various points. Maybe an hour or so later I got up to splash water on my face and drink some water.\nI think this made her snap back to reality a bit because she got up a few minutes later and instead of staying in a spare room she booked a taxi and went home. \n\nSometimes I think if I just calmed myself down and told her how I felt about her she might have opened up to me too... Maybe she was just being a good friend but thinking back she was acting differently and maybe it was more than that. I'm happy now and she's still a good friend but I dwell on this and know there will never be an opportunity like it again. I console myself with the fact that if I was wrong she might have totally recoiled and I would have lost her completely.",

She cropped them out and put a CK border around it.  She showed me what she saw.  A guy that could have been a model, maybe.  Maybe not, but certainly not ugly like I thought.  After that I started to reflect on moments through my life where girls in HS and college were coming on to me, and I just assumed they were just being nice.  I remember these two girls talking to me one day, one turned to the other and said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know\u201d.  It took me another 15 years to find out what they were talking about.",

I'd been told by my nerdy teenage boy friends - a real reliable source on sexual matters - that it was code for making out. I had a secret crush on her. She asked me to check her home work, I leaned over her to see her sheet. She looked me in the eyes with a (awkward) smile so I made a move, I thought I would be super suave and sensual running my hand in her hair at the back of her head and enlacing her, getting my tongue out -because that's how we French kiss right?- closed in on her mouth...\n\nWell her parents were home. She screemed and punched me. Turns out I was just good at math. We spent the last years of HS avoiding each other and I was \"that creepy nerd who thought he had a chance with the hot girl\".\n\nThis was the early 90s. Her father just laughed it off, I got the stinky eye from her mother and shame at school for a year or so. I'm so glad I wasn't born 20 years later, I'd probably be on the sex offender list.",

      "text": "In high school a girl I liked came over to hang out. We chilled for a bit and then the topic of massages came up and I told her I was pretty decent at them.  So she demands one and goes down to my room and gets ready for one. At this point I didn't know the clothes etiquette for women getting massages. Figured that bras stayed on just like the underwear does.  Came down to find her with nothing but panties on face down on the bed. I was really excited but nervous too when I saw that but kept it in check and played it cool.  So I give her the standard full massage and figure I'm done.  She says I gotta massage her while on her back too as that's what pros do and proceeded to flip  over without any extra covering.  Now I'm really nervous/ excited and continue to give her the rest of a normal massage. But then she tells me I need to massage her tits too. My first boob experience. I tell her I'm done after a bit and will give her some privacy to go shower and get dressed. She then literally tells me I could come help her if I wanted.  I was so nervous/nieve that I told her I wanted to respect her privacy and not take advantage of her and ran upstairs.  She comes up about half hour later dressed and tells me that I'm not taking advantage and starts making out with me hard. But I'm still so nervous about overstepping that I keep my hands and mouth above the belt line even after her shirt and bra come off again.  We fuck around like that for about 3.5 hours until she get a call from her dad telling her he's on his way to pick her up and will be there in ten.  So we continue making out but after about 5 mins she puts her hands down my pants and starts stroking me and inquires why I didn't fuck her at all. I told her i honestly didn't think she wanted me to go that far and didn't wanna scare her off by trying to push my luck. Her dad literally pulls up at this point so she tells me now I'll know for the next time she comes over. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShe moved 10 hours away later that month cause of family issues. \n\n\n\nMy awkwardness of that day still haunts  me despite it being half a lifetime ago.",

We started hanging out and she had parties every weekend because she lived with 4 other girls and we were young. So the third or so time of coming over, I'm there late after everyone has left, and she invites to her room to watch a movie. This is the part that hurts... I, fully clothed, sit on her bed and she comes out of the bathroom with her scant pj's on, asks if I want to stay the night because it's late, I said sure. She starts the movie, we're laughing and she's under the covers, tells me to get under them as well. I do. After a moment she says.. You can take your pants off if you want. Me, being oblivious and nervous, and yes still a virgin say, okay! I put my arm around her, but I'm not touching her really, just her pillow. She scoots over closer to me and we're spooning pretty much. I was so shy... Eventually she falls asleep. I wanted so much to ask if I could atleast kiss her... I put my pants back on and drove home. This haunts me to this day. 12 years later. We hung out a couple more times and things like this kept happening but I was too scared I guess.. The time I finally worked up courage to ask to kiss her after everyone left she said, well I better get to bed. And I never saw her again. She stopped texting me and had a boyfriend a couple months later. We remain acquaintances through social media.. But I always felt like I let her slip away because I never made a move. I don't blame her, I just never acted. It happens.",

She told me that she was there to tell me how much of a crush she had on me but then she chickened out when I didn\u2019t realize it was her who I was waiting for.

Two girls on the bus got into a fight and decided to get off about a mile from my bus stop so that they could scrap and not get suspended from school.\n\nMost of us got off the bus so that we could watch said fight (teenagers are stupid). I stood around for about 10 minutes before I finally got bored watching them do that thing that people do when they don't really want to fight, but they have talked too much trash and attracted too much of a crowd to back out of it.\n\nI announced that I was walking home and the prettiest girl on my street said that she would walk with me. I remember finding it odd that she was always coming over to me for conversation or she would choose to sit with me on the bus since I considered myself to be a dork at the highest level. I was extremely shy back then and considered her to be very out of my league.\n\nWe decided to take two shortcuts. One of the shortcuts required us to walk through a totally isolated pathway in the woods where no one can see you. It was while we were walking through this part of the woods that she kept dropping hints about how glad she was to be walking with me because she \"knew\" I wouldn't try anything. All the while, she was walking closer and closer to me. She must have said it at least four times during that short part of the journey. I felt like it could maybe make a move, but I wasn't sure.\n\nShe never sat with me on the bus again and she stopped having long conversations with me. Just \"hi\" and \"bye\". \n\nThirteen years later she sees me during our 10 year class reunion and ribs on me about how I blew off her \"obvious\" pass at me. I had to tell her that it was only obvious to her. I couldn't read between the lines and I was too afraid to try because she had a nice right cross back then. We laughed about it, but it still breaks my heart a little to this day that she could have been my first kiss and my first, second, and third base accomplice.",

I was the closest thing to a gentleman around our way.\n\nShe would not have dared to walk alone with any of the other guys because they had reputations (well earned I might add) of trying to take advantage of girls if they could catch them alone.I know for a fact that two of the guys were, at least, attempted rapists and one of them was a notorious peeping tom. Pretty screwed up set of dudes.\n\n In her take, she felt like if she called attention to the idea that I was least likely to try and sexually assault her, it would let me know that she felt safe enough to be alone with me and that, somehow, I would pick up that it was okay to make a move on her.\n\nShe was super pretty then (still is now), but she was also a tomboy. She even had a bit of swagger in her walk and she would play sports with us when we were outside.\n\nShe didn't do a good job of sending a message to me, but in her defense, and considering the behavior of the other people around us, she probably didn't know how else to approach it. \n\nNow I actually feel better about this because you guys did point out the mixed message she was sending to me. I guess all I could think about was the chance I missed. I definitely did not want to be known as a creep.",

She thought by pointing out that since I was not like some of the other guys who would have tried to rape her if they could have gotten her alone, I would pick up that she felt safe being alone with me and it would be okay to make a move.\n\nPlus she was giving me just about as seductive body language as an inexperienced teenage tomboy which wasn't great.\n\nI did the right thing; I just have the curse of hindsight now and that is why I feel like I missed.

I knew exactly what was happening in the moment, so did you it seemed like.  I was too scared basically.  fear of rejection has been a crippling attribute for my love life throughout my entire existence.  But with those big crushes like ours, it gets so amplified because the idea of that huge crush rejecting oneself is too much to imagine.  It\u2019s like I averted the possibility of that by not making a move because I thought it be better to crush and never have it happen than get rejected because at least there\u2019s still hope when you don\u2019t make a move.

We were freshmen in high school.  He had a sister who was about 5 years older than us.  My friend and I were playing ping pong in the basement when his sister comes down and starts talking shit to us.  Calling us names and generally insulting us.  So my friend says lets go upstairs.   He bolts upstairs. I pick up the ping pong ball and set it and my paddle on the table.  The lights to the basement go out.  The light from the stairway is the only light.   I think, \"that is weird.\"  I head for the stairs and his sister stands right in my way.  I am like just inches away from her and we were about the same height.  So I am inches from her face.  I can't see her face very well because it is backlight, the stairs are behind her.  I look at her with a WTF face then side step her and go upstairs.  She never said anything about that and either did I.  I just thought it was weird until a few years later when I matured some more.  And I have been kicking myself ever since.",

We all had a good time so they kept inviting us over all the time. Well one of them was super cute and I had a crush on her. We are all talking and they tell me that she has had some stalker come to her house and break stuff. They don\u2019t know who it is as he was wearing a hoody. She suggests that I spend the night to help her fall asleep and feel more safe. She sets up a little bed and blankets for me on the floor next to her bed. I think, \u201cok she just wants to be friends\u201d\nWell she goes to sleep in her bed and me being a watchful guard was staring out the window waiting and looking for this stalker to come by. I stayed awake till around 3:30am and then I got really tired and went to sleep. Around 6:30am she wakes me up and tells me I can come sleep in her bed while she takes a shower and gets ready for work. \nMe being incredibly sleepy and tired, my eyes are burning it\u2019s hard to keep them open, I slip into her bed. Fall asleep. \nAnd then she starts to wake me up again while she\u2019s in nothing but a towel and says \u201cI hope I don\u2019t drop this towel\u2026oops!\u201d then proceeds to drop it showing me her naked body. Me being still incredibly groggy and sleepy barely able to open my eyes, take a good look at her and smile and giggle and doze off back to sleep. \n\nShe wakes me up again. Fully dressed and offers me a ride home. \nThe car ride was so quiet and awkward. I was not entirely sure if I had dreamed that or if she really did that. Moron. It actually happened. A month later she got a boyfriend and that was the end of that friendship. They stopped inviting us over as much. I think about this moment too much.",

I was stranded since my car was broken, so she was basically trying to invite herself over for the night, but since I still lived at home I was uncomfortable with this.\n\nShe wanted to see me (so badly), so she drove over an hour to come pick me up and take me to her place, with her roommates away for the weekend. We watched a movie (Clerks) on her couch into the hours of like 2-3 in the morning. An awkward conversation where I assumed I'd crash on the couch led us to her twin bed and almost-spooning (clothes-on) until we fell asleep. \n\nMy ex really damaged me. I was SO afraid of making a move, even though I knew the window was wide open.\nLater events taught me we wouldn't have been a good couple anyway, but hey, we were young and single. That's one night I still sometimes regret.",

She mentions something about how she's pretty open about her body and then something about her boobs. I decided to go for it and ask if I could touch one of her boobs. She grabbed my hand and pulled it towards her left boob since I couldn't see shit. Nothing else happened that day because I ended up just touching it.\n\nI think about how I could've took it farther as long as she consented to it, but I was still content that I managed to touch a boob. Unfortunately that's the farthest I have gone, I'm sort of afraid to engage in sexual acts now, but reading these stories motivate me to go get laid now.  \n\n\nEdit: I also remember she played with my hair, so that was a very nice plus",

He was going to visit a girl he met in the summer, I was going along for the ride. We\u2019re at her house. She invites a friend over to watch a movie. She (original girl) goes upstairs to \u201ccheck on something\u201d and invites my friend to go with her. Now it\u2019s this new girl and me and we\u2019re watching Fellowship of the Ring. I\u2019m so sucked into the movie that I didn\u2019t realize she\u2019d moved from the chair to the cushion next to me.\n\nWhen I noticed her new position as the credits rolled, I was so shocked that I didn\u2019t say anything as she headed out saying she was tired.\n\nThey were sorority sisters at UCLA. I think about this one all the time.\n\nOblivious girl:\n\nMy girlfriend at the time and I had a friend we always hung out with. One night, we\u2019re at her house and head up to her friends room and all hop in bed to hangout (I was just going with it). We end up laying down with our friend in between us.\n\nI look over and see my girlfriend\u2019s head on our friends shoulder, mouthing \u201cthreesome\u201d. My mind is exploding. I copy her movements. We\u2019re all laughing and stuff. We\u2019re both basically on top of our friend\u2026 and she doesn\u2019t do anything. I figured she picked up on what was happening and was too embarrassed to directly say she wasn\u2019t into it.\n\nYears later I\u2019m laughing about this with the friend and she looks shocked. I ask if she\u2019s alright. She responds: \u201cI had no idea, you should\u2019ve told me! I\u2019d always wanted to have a three way with you two!\u201d\n\nRIP.\n\nHindsight 20/20 though. I\u2019ve been with my current girlfriend for 4 years and have never been happier :)\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: ALWAYS COMMUNICATE!",

I thought they were messing with me trying to trap me and call me a pervert. So I responded with the totally appropriate response of \"but look, I can make room if we just move stuff around.\" Well after my comment she slapped me and climbed into my lap. Her giant bubblebutt that she was moving around a lot with gave me an instant erection which caused me to go beet red immediately, so I did the sensible thing and pretended to be asleep. They drove an extra 20 minutes out of the way to drop my sister off first, then proceeded to \"wake me up\" and talk about blowjobs until we got to my house. Only found out a few years later by my sister that she didn't know what they were doing at the time and they really liked me. \n\nEveryone at my high-school thought I was super mysterious and they thought I was a genius. All because I was super shy and had terrible anxiety so I was hyper focused on doing work all of the time.",

I denied and kept telling everyone that we're just tight, you know?\n\nR eventually confessed and I (dumbass) still had the audacity to get caught off guard. I rejected R at first because we all knew I was just getting over a long time crush (different girl in our circle) who played me and another friend out at the time (we're all good friends now despite that. Because everyone has been young and dumb; so understandable). \n\nSo basically I didn't want to use R as a rebound because \"no girl deserved to be treated that way\", I exclaimed. \n\nAnd \"that's how much I love her\", I followed up. \n\nThat's when it hit me.\n\nLong story short, sorted my feelings out and we've been happily together for 7 years now. After we build up our saving a little more, I'm gonna propose. \n\n\nAnd not a day goes by where I don't think, \"what if I missed that chance?\" or \"what if I took more time to sort out my feelings? Would I've been too late?\" \n\nThankfully, I'm one of the lucky ones despite all that ^^^",

Before school started, I knew she didn't know anyone else our age, so one night I took her out and showed her the town. As we were enjoying some late night tacos, she randomly tells me \u201cjust in case you were wondering, I\u2019m on birth control, soooo \u2014 \u201c and then sort of shrugs at me. Me, being the idiot that I was back then, was completely confused by the exchange and chalked it up to cultural differences. Frankly, I was incredibly naive and innocent at the time and simply couldn't imagine that a woman might be hitting on me in such a forward manner.\n\nWe became good friends. My social group became her social group. The school year went by swimmingly, but I never followed up on my smitteness. I just never got the vibe that she was into it. The final week of her stay rolls around\u2026we're driving to some party together\u2026 and before we exit the car, she leans over and kisses me. \"Whoa, where did that come from?\" I asked. She replied, \"Look, I know you're not into me, but I've always had a crush and I leave in a week... so what do I have to lose?\" I was floored. I asked her why she never said anything, or ever really flirted with me. [Of course] She says \"What are you talking about? I threw myself at you that one night\u2026 I straight up asked if you wanted to fuck, and you rejected me. How was I supposed to flirt with you after that?\" \n\nWe made the most of our last few days together... but man, that could've been such a special year if I hadn't been such a virginal rube.",

Once out there, the neighbor and the girlfriend made out while me and the other girl awkwardly twiddled our thumbs. After a while, we swam back, and everybody went home.\n\nCut to a short time later and there's a knock on the door. The very, very cute girlfriend was there. Alone. She wanted to swim out to the boat again. Big audible *gulp*! sound, I make some excuse and  beg off A) because I was afraid of the neighbor kid finding out and B) that swim was dumb enough once honestly. Currents even in a bay ain't nothing to fuck with. But I'd be lying if I didn't think about that girl and the opportunity I punted on a bunch afterwards.",

She caught me glancing at her several times, much to my chagrin and embarrassment.....\nMy friend who was.far handsomer than I obviously got with some girl, which was always my cue to pootle off home, and she said \"oh, I'll go too, can you walk me?\".\n\"Sure!\".\nSo the goddess alighted from her pedestal, and followed my ugly ass back to the hostel, with me making my usual pithy remarks and her politely (or so I thought) giggling....\nWe made it back, and she stood quite close to me....\nAnd she breathed \"well, I guess it's time for bed....' in what seemed to be a whole octave lower than her usual voice...... Her eyes were downcast and flicked up towards me...... \nAs I replied....\n\"Yep! See ya tomorrow!\" And wandered off to my room.\nYeah.\nThat actually happened. \nThe only way I could have done it worse would have been to shake her hand or something before leaving.",

I wasn\u2019t drinking and neither was she, but she started playing with a \u201cfuck tab\u201d\u2026the pop top off a beer can.  It was a thing back in the day that you give it to the person you wanted to fuck.  I told her what it was, and she said, \u201cI know, I was going to give it to you\u201d\u2026at which point I blushed and stammered something about something and got up and walked out the back door\u2026.she FOLLOWED ME out the back door and literally shoved the fuck tab into my hand.  I just stared at it until she said, \u201cwell, are we going to find a room?\u201d  And wouldn\u2019t you know it\u2026all the rooms were full! So I tried to fuck her in my friends station wagon but as soon as we got our clothes off everyone started rocking the car so much she freaked out and I didn\u2019t get to fuck her.  I was pissed and embarrassed all at the same time\u2026.I still think about that and shake my head",

Me, sometime later: She takes really long showers, there'd better be enough hot water left for when I shower. After that she's walking around the house with just a towel on for maybe an hour.                     Me: wondering how she isn't dry by now. Oof.",

      "text": "I think I can top this.\n\nBack in the day I had a crush on this girl Samantha from like 6th grade until, well, ever. Big deal, so did everybody. She was the most popular girl at school, gorgeous, funny, and cool. I was the opposite of those things. I just had my mind made up that there was no chance for me and she was just really nice to give me any kind of attention. In 10th grade, one day after school I walked towards the parking lot right outside and saw her sitting on the curb. She looked at me, smiled, and called me over. She was chewing gum and she asked me if I wanted any gum. I said sure, and held my hand out. She said okay but this is the only gum I have while pointing to the gum in her mouth. In my head I think well that\u2019s weird but whatever, I reached my hand to her mouth but she kept looking at me and she shook her head as if to say \u201cno, not like that.\u201d I realize oh wow, she wants to actually kiss me, and is just using the gum as a playful excuse. So I sit down next to her, and lean in. She immediately spits the gum straight down onto the ground, grabs a fistful of my hair, pulls me towards her and initiates the most aggressive making out I\u2019ve ever experienced. At that point it was easily the highlight of my entire life. It went on for about a minute, and afterwards I didn\u2019t know what to say or do but I did know that I needed to go home soon. So I stood up, grabbed my backpack, and thanked her\u2026for the kiss. She said \u201cgosh m4vis, you are so cute.\u201d I thanked her again, and then just said\u2026well\u2026gotta go\u2026see you on Monday.\n\nYa\u2019ll. I walked 2 miles home, happy as can be, but this was the thought in my head\u2026\u201dWow, Samantha is just the nicest. She\u2019s so nice that out of pure generosity, she made out with me in spite of the fact that she definitely has zero romantic attraction or feelings for me at all. Just to brighten my day.\u201d \n\nIn other news, scientists say my brain is so dense that they need to re-evaluate the theory of gravity in order to explain how I haven\u2019t collapsed all of reality into a singularity of idiocy and destruction already.",

There were 3 girls who were looking for a 4th person to be in the group since their 4th was absent\u2026. and they all collectively decided that I was the one they wanted in the group.

In this split second. I decided that the best choice was to tell the new guy to go sit with the girls since I was already used to being in a group with the 3 other guys I always grouped up with.\n\nI found out one of the girls was into me and the other girl who asked the teacher that she wanted me in their group ALSO liked me.",

She always had a nice body and large breasts from what I could see. (Up until that point we only saw each other in school uniforms.)  I open the door and there she is in a tight, gray Abercrombie and Fitch t-shirt with no bra. \n\nI take a big nervous gulp and awkwardly say \u201chey come on in.\u201d I give her a tour of the house and then\u2026we go to my room. We\u2019re hanging out and talking about life, school, we watch a movie on tv etc. We are just enjoying each other\u2019s company, hanging out and then she asks if it would be ok if we cuddled a little bit. \n\nI say sure. She laid her head on my lap at first but then\u2026she put her hand on my thigh\u2026now I am rock hard trying to hide it from her and nervous as hell and thankful that at least it\u2019s dark in the room. The movie goes on and we keep chatting and she started saying how cute and sweet I am for always being a good person, available, listener, and that she\u2019s always had a crush on me since freshman year. \n\nStill caressing my thigh..she says \u201ccome lay down with me\u2026I\u2019m thinking I\u2019m in over my head and this is all a little too much. At this point I\u2019m so flustered so I say I need to go to the bathroom. I excuse myself, get to the bathroom, put water on my face, catch my breathe, and as I open the door to my surprise she was there.\n\nShe gently pushes me back in to the bathroom and says, I kid you not \u201cSo, I gotta quick question for you\u2026is this shirt too tight?\u201d I\u2019m at a loss for words and fumble my words and say \u201cNoo, no, it\u2019s fine. I think it uh, looks great.\u201d She giggles and says \u201coh really? You mean my tits?\u201d I say \u201cno, I mean yes. I mean you know what I mean.\u201d (In hindsight, she probably caught me trying not to look at her chest and wanted to tease me a little bit.) \n\nShe proceeds to lift up her shirt and show her chest! A good 5 seconds pass and I can\u2019t look away from her boobs\u2026only to be snapped out of it by her playfully saying \u201c\u2026you can take a picture if you want\u201d I am flushed red. We laugh and head back to the room. We lay down and cuddle a bit before we start actually touching each other. She makes me touch her breasts and jokes as if I\u2019m only giving her a breasts exam. We laugh and then she notices something poking her butt and jokingly asked \u201coh, what\u2019s that?\u201d I say \u201c\u2026sorry, I can\u2019t help it.\u201d She grabs it through my shorts and says \u201coh, it\u2019s fine, hehe, but maybe I can help it?\n\nWe had a good night\u2026but I was awkward as fuck.",

I stand up, hand clamp onto towel, red faced, we figure out they got off elevator on the wrong floor and walked to what they thought was their room. They leave with \"omg sorry!\".\n\nNext day one asks if she can come study with me. She says no to lobby or study lounge, wants to come back to my room. She asks \"will your roommate be there?\" me: \"no, he works till 9\". I'd seen her around, but never spoken to her before towel. \n\nShe brings a book and we talk, she sits on my bed, very close, gives me the *look*, but I'd never seen it before and miss it. Talks about working out, showering, how much her butt and legs are stronger and in better shape now with college coaches, etc. She keeps trying for about half an hr, then gives up on me.\n\nLater that semester I learn about the density of uranium, and decide its got nothing on me.",

I was talking to a casual friends girlfriend at a party and she asked what I liked to do for fun and I told her about the nature walks I guided.  She was so incredibly beautiful I was always tongue tied talking to her. I was stunned and intimidated by her beauty and she was talking to me, closely and interested. Everyone talked about her as this unreal goddess and how Neal was the the luckiest guy ever.  A few weeks later she showed up at one of the nature walks by herself.  She went for the tour and then asked me if i would give her a private tour and show me where I said there were owls\u2026 sure!.  On the way there see said she wasn\u2019t seeing Neal any more and really liked our conversation the other day and wanted to come and see me.  I walked her to a seclude area where there was a roosting great horned owl.  She grabbed hand as we walked and she told me how much she had been thinking of me, especially alone at night and gave me a big sexy wink wink smile. I was immediately both stunned and terrified.  I immediately changed the subject and nervously asked her if she liked bird and she said\u2026. \u201cBirds!?\u2026. Yuck, they\u2019re like, you know\u2026 flying rats, gross\u201d.   At that very moment my heart both sank and I was relived\u2026 Then she said \u201clet\u2019s put my blanked down here and see what happens\u201d\u2026.. I said, \u201csorry, can\u2019t. I need to get back to the center and head home for dinner. Maybe some other time\u201d.   I turned around and briskly walked back to the center with her trying to keep up.  She said hi to me a few time after that but I was to embarrassed to ever talk to her again\u2026. I was pathetic.",

After polishing off a fifth of vodka between the 4 of us it was time to get some sleep. My crush saved me a spot on her bed. \ud83d\ude0d This might be my chance, I thought. Sometime in the middle of the night, our legs slowly found each other\u2019s then, our hands gently familiarized themselves with each other\u2019s bodies while courteously trying not to make a sound and alert her 2 friends in the bed literally 2 feet away. Finally, our lips meet and it\u2019s too much. We\u2019re both breathing heavily pulling up our clothes under the sheets. I remember feeling her wetness over her panties when she said I don\u2019t want to wake my friends. I had a sobering feeling wash over me and I agreed. I mean heck, I would\u2019ve wanted the same if I was on the other side of the coin and we were going to spend the next 14+ hours together in lines so it was an easy decision. \n\nA few days pass and she was on her last shift of her program. The incredible part was we were both scheduled morning shifts sweeping in neighboring lands and her shift only started like an hour before mine. She finally took up my offer to sneak around backstage and show her all the secret spots I knew. I\u2019m a big nerd when it comes to this stuff. There were many times we were alone and I was just taking in how cool it was. \n\nAfter we hit all the spots we went to my favorite break area under the train (you can watch it pass but guests can\u2019t see you) to wait until her last time to clock out ever. I remember sitting at the table with her on a bench seat and she just goes on her phone with a \u201cokayy when is it time to get out of here\u201d face that\u2019s now permanently engrained in my brain. At the time I just thought she wasn\u2019t impressed. It wasn\u2019t until months later I realized she didn\u2019t agree to do that with me to get the free tour. I honestly don\u2019t have a good reason I was so dumb other than thinking there will be a better time to make out, now, we are exploring. \ud83e\udd74\ud83e\udd74\n\nShe is now married.",

She comes in and she just looks at the blood and shaving cream all over me, the floor, the walls and laughs at the 2nd hand embarrassment. She sat me on the bed and cleaned the mess up while I passed out. Woke up a while later and she was sleeping on the bed. Woke up again at 9 and she was gone, never saw her again.

I really liked the new girl, but I said we could do it as long as she understood we weren\u2019t getting back together. We did it, and for lack of another word, it was unpleasant.

The three of us were hanging until my friend got caught with a blunt\u2026 she got asked to leave, but spotted another one of her friends outside, so they left to another club. \n\nI stayed with the stud I had met, and he bought me drinks all night. Come closing time, he asked if he could come back to my place. I kept calling my friend to see if she was home yet, because I really wanted to bring this guy back, but not if she was sleeping 5 feet away from where we were gonna fuck\u2026 Fearful that I\u2019d be overstepping my bounds as a guess, I turned this guy down, and went back to the apartment.\n\nOf course, I returned to find that my friend wasn\u2019t there. I ended up taking a shower and going to right to bed after that. I awoke the next afternoon to my friend returning with some iced coffee. She asked me if I had the stud over last night! I told her I was nervous to bring someone back to her place just to fuck, and she told me that she stayed the night out on purpose so I\u2019d have the place to myself.\n\nNeedless to say, I felt like a major dumbass. However, I did get his number\u2026 so I could possibly have a second chance the next time I\u2019m in Miami",

I asked her if she wanted anything for breakfast and she said mc d's would do.  Then I don't remember what we talked about but I was so tired I fell asleep. The morning after, I got her mc d's but she wasn't really feeling it. I just said you could've told me if you wanted something else but she was like whatever.\n\nI didn't understand then but I now understand what I did (or didn't do). This thought haunts me from time to time but reading all these similar stories definitely helps. Thanks everyone.",

I told them I wasn't sure if I had one but I could go look and bring on to them if I found one. They told me not to worry and invited themselves in. Surprised by the sudden turn of events I told them to hold on and that I would go look right now. \n\nI proceeded to leave both of them alone just inside the doorway to go look for a screwdriver. After several minutes of searching, I was not able to find one. When I returned with the bad news, I found them both in the living room. One of them was splayed out on the couch and the other was lying in her laps and playing with her hair. \n\nI just stood in the doorway leading to the living room and told them that I couldn't find a screwdriver but I'd be sure to let them know if my roommate had one when he came back after which I immediately flipped a 180 and went straight back to my room. \n\nI'm assuming they let themselves out at some point after discovering my superpower. I still cry when I remember that day.",

She would always walk very close to me on the way to the bus, and was very touchy and sometimes compliment me on certain things. I never realized that she was hinting at liking me the whole time, not to mention she did this on multiple, back to back days. I never though hmm, maybe she's flirting, just that she was being funny and open around me. I also had another where a my female friend's friend was a girl I liked, but I never knew she liked me as well. We never spoke really outside of her being around my other friend, so there weren't any hints to pick up on, but my friend told me after she moved schools that she liked me, and in the moment I was wondering why she wouldn't let me know she liked me when she was still going to school with us. Those are 2 of a few clueless experiences I've had with women, I've also had a friend outright tell me in front of her boyfriend who was also kind of my friend, that if she didn't pick him she'd pick me. I didn't really like her, but it was an awkward experience and I didn't say much about it except an awkward laugh to avoid silence. I've also had another friend in highschool ask me to whip out my little guy in class right when we were about to go to next period. I've also had an ex girlfriend I guess (we were like 10) mom tell me she wish I had stayed around, things could've turned out better for her if we had hanged around each other more during our teenage years. Her daughter now has 2 daughters at the age of 19. I thought she would've went a completely different route, because when we were kids she was very smart and about her work, she's still attractive today but went down a track I didn't think she would.\n\nI wasn't particularly attractive in my opinion in highschool, I have medium length hair, I was at the time 6 foot, and I was very expressive around other people, kind of the funny guy, but also very insecure behind closed doors. Now looking back I don't think I was as bad looking as I thought, and could've had a lot more relationships if I had more confidence and wasn't as clueless. I didn't even exercise really and all that happened.",

We would talk for literal hours and one day she stopped me in the middle of the hallway and said \u201chand me your phone\u201d so I did and she put in her number and the name had her name with a heart and unicorn next to it. Scared I would fuck something up and I would no longer have this awesome friend I never asked her out because I assumed I would be rejected and eventually our friendship would fall apart. (I was overweight, nerdy, and set up to graduate top of the class and she would eventually be cheerleading captain and salutatorian) I crushed on her for three more years until eventually she started secretly dating this guy from our work and hiding a bunch of stuff from me when we were such open books before. Our friendship has dissolved into making sure we aren\u2019t dead every couple of months and I wonder how much different that could of been if I just had the damn courage to say something\u2026\n\nOther scenario was this hot girl at my work walked up to me and said that she was sorry she missed yesterday, then got really close and whispered in my ear that she had just gotten her nipples pierced. Asked if I wanted to see them and I said \u201cdamn that sounds painful, glad you like them\u201d and went to go make our orders\n\n\nI am a stupid man",

She constantly sent me tons of pics of her (Not nudes) and eventually i invite her over (as friends) and she accepts. We meet many times after that, me thinking were getting closer since she was ok with me and her in the bed to watch stuff. The bed is rather small and we barely fit in there next to each other. So much so that occasionally her left boob touches my right arm and she says she doesnt mind. One day we walk at night to my car to drive her home and she started holding my hand on the way to the car. \n\nYeah somehow it turns out she isnt actually into me, so when i made my move i got rejected. It was a very confusing experience. I just kept thinking, surely, if this was any other women, those would be signs shes into me, no?",

When I arrived we talked, and planned to get wasted and high on drugs together (alone) and yes, ecstasy involved ;) it was going to be the best day in my life. She had planned to go to a theater with her friends beforehand however, so I went to a pub to procrastinate.\n\n15 minutes later a group of students showed up, generously offered their strong ass weed which I selfishly overabused, and the following 60 minutes were spent vomitting bent over the pub toilet.\n\nThe girl came to pick me up, walked me home and put me to bed. In the morning I gazed on the beauty laying beside me, realising what I had missed out on.\n\nShe made me pancakes, and I left before noon.",

The laser pointer had different shapes and one was a heart. She would point it at my chest and I had no idea at the time what it meant. Well she actually asked me out and that\u2019s how we started dating. We would mess around and get pretty far until stupid dumb me would stop and say something like \u201clet\u2019s wait until we\u2019re 18 to have sex\u201d she said she had condoms and that we didn\u2019t have to wait. I told her that I respect her and that I won\u2019t until we\u2019re older. Well guess what? That never happened. I didn\u2019t have another gf again till I was 21. Fucking cock blocked myself.

Very inexperienced with girls. My friend and I were at an adult party and were bored. It was an opening of a new wine bar and my parents were friends with the owners (sounds grander than it was). We were pretty much left alone and we were discreetly stealing drinks where we could (minesweeping is the British term) - basically stealing half drunk glasses of champagne from tables where they\u2019d been temporary put down by someone. \n\nThe owner had a daughter who was hot and older than us - maybe 17 or 18. She was there with her friend and they were also clearly bored (and also getting tipsy). They ignored us all evening\u2026until it was quite late and the party was winding down. Only the friends and family were left and they seemed to be settling in for a while yet. At this point one of the adults said we could go upstairs to the flat and watch TV if we wanted. We went up\u2026and the girls were already there. \n\nMy memory is hazy but my next clear memory is of me ending up sitting next to the friend on the sofa and my friend cuddled with the daughter in an armchair. The girls were giggling and teasing us. Asking about girls and our experience and things. Then my friend and the daughter got up and went into another room, leaving me with her friend.\n\nShe asked if I wanted to sit in her lap\u2026then she asked if I wanted to kiss her hand... \n\nI was so aroused. So shy. I barely pecked her hand. We kept talking and the moment passed. The conversation turned boring. Then she put the TV on.  \n\nMaybe nothing would have happened. Maybe we would made out (snogged in British-speak). Who knows. All I know is I look back and kick myself and wonder what could have happened if I\u2019d been a little bolder. \n\n(My friend heavily implied that he and the daughter made out and touched each other. He later admitted they briefly kissed only!)",

I had a bunch of friends and girl I was trying to get with come over and she brought a few friends as well. \n\nHer friends were the ones who were flirting with me and eventually they wanted to check out my room. Once they got in my room, they both jumped in my bed and wouldn't get out until I got in with them. I awkwardly and sheepishly get on the bed and process to lay stiff as a board for about 2 minutes and then jumped up and ushered them back to the main room where everyone else, plus the girl I wanted to get with, was at.\n\nIdk why I thought not doing anything would impress her because at the time, I didn't know how to get them outta my room without picking them up so I figured getting in the bed was the easiest way.  She did not agree lol \n\nTldr:\nSo to sum it all up, I have two fine women in my bed wanting to hook up with me, while a group of my immature friends and a girl u wanted to get with, were no more than 15 ft away in the next room. This was also my parents house so they were upstairs as well. \n\nI lay awake at night still wishing I would have pulled the trigger and went for it because I did end up dating the girl I wanted to but it didn't work out so I got double not screwed?

Since the first time we met there was strong chemistry between us; we would laugh and flirt with each other. She even made a random comment one day saying that she bet I had a big dick in front of our friends. \n\nThere was a house party on the beach one night and she was there. After a while people started going to the ocean. As she was walking to the water with a couple of her girlfriends she knew I was behind her and she kept looking back at me smiling. She started taking off all of her clothes while still looking back at me. One of my boys was behind me and he was watching the scene unfold too. When she got into the water she was completely naked still looking at me. I felt like she was inviting me to be with her. Idk wtf I was thinking but I just stood there with my drink in my hand 20 yds from the shore. As my boy got closer he did not hesitate at all and took off all his clothes and got into the water with her. Usually I\u2019m assertive in situations like this but I froze this time and I\u2019m not sure why. \n\nThis was about 10-12 years ago and I had forgot this happened until I started reading these stories lol. Moral of the story is to go for it, so you won\u2019t have to make posts like this",

      "text": "When I was at University, aged 19 or 20, there was this really cute girl I liked, similar musical taste, long brown hair, very pretty. She used to go on about wanting to get a motorbike and needing lessons. Eventually I took the hint and offered to give her some lessons on my motorbike.\n\nWe arrange a date and time and I drove over to pick her up. She was all spruced up when I turned up, which I wasn't expecting, so I told her to put on older clothes in case she fell off.\n\nFirst we had to drive to a car park that I knew would be empty and so she was sitting behind me, doing the full \"arms around the driver\" passenger thing, but also sort of leaning into me. We get to the car park and she says she's liking this position, so I sort of awkwardly get off the bike and force her to release her grip.\n\nThen she wants me to sit on the bike behind her while she has a go, so I can hold onto her like she was holding on to me. I'm in full \"teacher-mode\" now, so I'm all like, \"nope, you need to get used to driving on your own\". She pouts a bit at this, but goes along with the plan.\n\nTurns out she's totally hopeless at riding my motorbike, mainly because she's far too small and she ends up dropping it. I check she's okay and then start looking over my bike, seeing the scratches and twisted pegs, etc. and starting to work out how I'm going to fix everything.\n\nThat sort of killed the mood so we drive back to her house. On the way back I'm so worried about my bike that I completely forget she's on the back of the bike. Because she was so small the weight of the bike isn't much different from driving on my own so I start weaving in and out of traffic, driving like I would normally do without a passenger when I was too young to drive sensibly.\n\nWhen we get back to her house she's literally white with fear and looks like she's going to be sick. I apologise repeatedly and end up practically having to carry her inside when I was planning to just drop her off and drive straight home.\n\nInside the house she makes a rapid recovery and starts telling me about how she's been doing \"glamour modelling\" to make some extra money. I show some vague interest and this is enough for her to offer to \"show me\", her hands go to start lifting up her top.\n\nI'm still thinking about my bike and so I politely decline her offer and she disappointedly stops pulling off her clothes. Something far away at the back of my mind starts to realise something strange is happening, but it's like a distant voice that I can't hear properly and so I decide to ignore it. After all, this girl is far too cute to have any interest in me.\n\nThen she starts talking about how she's single and wants to find an ideal boyfriend. Starts describing this lucky person and it's basically me, even down to the degree I was doing, physical appearance, musical tastes, etc. I tell her that I'll keep an eye out for anyone like that.\n\nI decide I want to get home and start fixing my bike but she's all like, \"you don't have to go, you can stay here if you want. I even changed the bed this morning\". But I'm not seeing how that's going to work as I need my tools and they live at my house, also it's early afternoon and far too early to be going to sleep. So I say goodbye and get up to walk out her house.\n\nAs I'm leaving she gives me a big hug for taking her on a bike lesson and does this weird thing where she puts her head up out of the hug and closes her eyes with her lips pursed. I break the clinch and get on my bike. I have a horrid feeling that I patted her on the head in confusion.\n\nAbout halfway back to my house, about 10 minutes away, I suddenly stop thinking about my poor bike and realise what just happened... FUCK!!!\n\nI bump into a friend of hers a few days later and she tells me that this girl told her everything that happened and assumed I just didn't like her... FUCK!!!\n\nFoolishly, I decide it's too late to do anything about this and spend the next six months desperately trying to ignore her as I'm so embarrassed.",

      "text": "I have 3 that stick in my mind that I think about all the time:\n\nFirst:  I was 12 or 13, and this hot girl same age as me came over to hang out and we were sitting on my bed and she started feeling get breasts and asked if I wanted to, and I said lets go to the pool.  Wasn't even thinking she would be interested in me she was way out of my league.  A couple years late she has a serious boyfriend and I ask her if we would have had sex that day and she said definitely.  That one turns out it was for the best apparently she was a slut and tried to sleep with as many guys as possible starting at a young age, and got pregnant by 16.  I dodged a bullet on that one.\n\nSecond: When I was a freshman in high school, I was out of town for a conference, and met a senior from another state there, staying in the same hotel.  We hung out and went on a walk, went swimming, etc...  We go back to her hotel room.  I'm sitting on the bed, she sitting next to me, and says something about being 69'd before and that she thought about doing more but haven't, then gets up and says I need to take a shower.  She takes a shower, comes out with her towel wrapped around her like women do, and laid on the bed next to me, gave me a, \"come hither\" look, and I just stare back blanking like \"what am I supposed to do?\"  Like an idiot, I miss the signs that she wanted me, and say, \"Get dressed so we can go get dinner.\"  After I say that she was like, \"turn around so I can get dressed.\"  She wouldn't let me see her naked after I miss the obvious signs to see her naked. Granted she wasn't hot hot, but still out of my league, maybe a 6 in New York and a 7 in Scranton. I think about that night almost every day.  I was a dumb 15 year old.\n\nThird:  I was a freshman in college and met this girl at her dorm, and are sitting on her bed and talking and she says, \"I enjoy sex, it would be nice to be able to have it more, I'm usually not alone in my room that often.\"  I replied with \"Oh, that's nice, must feel good to get a break from your roommates.\" Completely oblivious to her asking for sex, I ended up just leaving after watching a movie.\n\nBonus one that I just thought of:  I was so dumb and oblivious when I was younger, not much as changed now that I am in my 40s.  A couple years ago, before the pandemic started, I met this woman at a sports game we were both at, and started talking and got her number.  I called her the next day, ask her out she said yes, we go out to dinner, after dinner start making out in the car.  Then I take her home and drop her off.  I called her and asked her out again and she was like, \"Um, I was just looking to get laid and you didn't seem interested in me that way.\"  I replied with \"What?  I am interested give me another chance, I will have sex with you.\"  She replied back with \"You didn't have sex with me last night, I doubt you'll get up the nerve to have sex with me another night, sorry.\"  \n\nTurns at 15 year old me and 41 year old me are the same in many ways unfortunately, I guess which is why I am on redditt, just an awkward antisocial introvert.",

I was working at a coffee shop and the cute girl I served told me to come by the shop she works at, that was sorta near by. She was very forward without being literal. Except I was already in a new relationship at this time so of course I didn't go meet with her. Then 4 months later we broke up, and I tried looking for the store this other girl was working at. To see if maybe she was still interested, but couldn't remember the exact name and address of where to go by that point. It would be my luck that the only time I got hit on was when I couldn't act on it lol. Also I was just completely blindsided by the fact this cute girl was even hitting on me at all.",

Ridiculously smart, as in taking 10th grade classes in the library while being in 7th grade, incredibly attractive, and she had this aura that made me not feel incredibly awkward when talking with her. While I was above average, I had no problem getting A grades if I gave a little bit of effort, I just didn\u2019t really care about it. So we ended up not being in the same classes, save for two. I did everything I could to strike up conversation while we were not actively learning. We remained really good friends throughout the rest of middle school into high school. She actually put me onto one of my favourite book series to this day. My school had a winter dance which required formal dress to attend, and I worked up the nerve to ask her to it. My father ended up driving us there and back. We had a great time. In high school I\u2019d occasionally go over to her house and just sort of hang out. Anyways, tenth grade rolls around, and I\u2019m informed that she\u2019s moving to Germany, my home country. During all of 10th grade, I tried my best to psych myself up to ask her out. I missed my shot. Fast forward a few years, and I open up my old Facebook account to see what I\u2019ve missed. Turns out she got with a guy that has my same name, except he\u2019s quite a lot better looking. She, of course, is as attractive as ever.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 5 years since I last saw her, and I still think about her way more than I should. Sometimes I think about shooting her a message, but I doubt she even remembers me.",

Weeeelll him and I were talking one day and he mentioned that she liked me and he offered to give her my number. I agreed. My family and I were taking a trip to NC to see some family and her and I talked on the phone like the entire time. We texted. We called. It was awesome. Her PoS dad would always take her phone away if he saw her on it and treated her like absolute shit, but her and I worked through it. When I got back, we went to a festival. We held hands. We talked. It was so fun. Then back at school we just couldn't get enough of each other. We were in love! Her and I had this guitar class together and we got into an argument before the concert, because her ex was messaging her and I didn't like that. He was known for trying to bang people's girlfriends and she said he was flirting with her, so I was upset that she was still talking to him. Well, I eventually left the concert after the performance, because I was hurt. She was hurt. We made up through text and I had to see her, so I ran all 3 miles to the school to go to her. I made it. It was nighttime. We went under a tree and kissed. I felt my first boob. It was great. \n\nMore time went by and her dad fucking died from a heart attack. (I have a firm belief that her mom fucking murdered him) We were finally free to be together with no boundaries. We would skip school to have sex in my house while my parents were at work. We would talk all the time and hang out. It was sweet! Well after a year went by, my dad told me that we were moving to NC. This crushed me. I had to break the news to her. She didn't take it well. I had to be strong about it, because I didn't want to make her feel even more sad. After I moved, I broke up with her. I felt like it would be more painful to try to make it work. Well, I then eventually found out that she started dating the friend that got us together. It sucked. I was miserable. I think they are married now. Thanks for reading.",

      "text": "The first two times I was going to get a blow job were comically interrupted - I legit thought I was cursed.\n\nTHE BASEMENT INCIDENT:\n\nWhen I was in late middle school and early high school, I was uh\u2026 sexual\u2026 and somehow managed to carve out a niche for myself with the girls in my class.  I went to a relatively small private catholic school, and kids were just experimenting with sexuality and I found myself smack dab in the center of it with a group of them - in hindsight likely in part because I kept my mouth shut and so others didn\u2019t necessarily find out (besides their friends of course).\n\nWell I\u2019m 8th grade a new girl transferred to the school from a public school who was a lot more \u201cmature\u201d than the others.  She legit would say things like \u201cI know how to put everything in my mouth\u201d.. it was not something I was ready for or frankly that I ever experienced again in my adult life. \n\nWell, I became a bit of a target for her and it was a wild ride.  She\u2019d do things like sit across from me during art class (reminder we\u2019re not even in high school yet) and take her foot out of her shoe and rub it on my crotch.  I know deeply where the term scaroused came from.\n\nThis went on for weeks.  But we never met up outside of school, so it never materialized into anything serious.  Until finally a friend threw a huge party, probably for his birthday or something, at his house - dozens of kids everywhere running about.  Towards the end of the night we find ourselves snuggled up in a cranny of their basement somewhere and slowwwly things start progressing.  Hand on my thigh; inching forward at what felt like an inch per 5 minutes; pants pulled down slightly; and then finally I\u2019m out in the open with her head in proximity and I hear a shout from another room \u201cWHERE\u2019S OP!! YOUR MOM\u2019S HERE TO PICK YOU UP!!\u201d\n\nDOUBLE TROUBLE:\n\nTime goes by and Im in my freshman year.  And now social circles are starting to expand a bit - I find myself having small pockets of friends from other schools nearby and a fresh set of trouble to try to get into.\n\nOne of those groups included a very wealthy, criminally under-cared for wild girl and her friend who were attached at the hip.  She had an awesome house with a pool in the backyard and a pool house\u2026 coupled with a single mom who was bordering on criminally irresponsible for letting her high school-aged daughter run parties out of her house as if she was a frat boy in Old School.\n\nIt was an absolute shit show.  Kids were everywhere, often getting sloppy drunk and doing stupid shit.  Puking.  Damaging parts of the pool house by drawing on stuff, jumping on tables, etc.\n\nAt the time I didn\u2019t drink or anything, so I often found myself on the outskirts of the ruckus with a smaller group who also didn\u2019t really get into the nonsense.  That typically involved hanging out in what I imagine was once a walk-in closet in the pool house that was retrofitted into a hangout space by putting two of those massive bean bags that you could unzip and would lay flat like a square on the group for kids to just hang on.\n\nSo I was usually chillin in there with a small group and people would sort of circulate in and out - the door was open and it was directly connected to the main room where the party was, so was pretty easy to sort of dip in and out.\n\nI went to these parties more or less weekly for months.  And sort of served as the linchpin between the kids from the host girl\u2019s school and various people from my school who would swing by because of the excitement of meeting new people (social circles at these small private schools were typically very insular, so it was really pretty exciting for everyone at the time to be mixing it up).  A lot of crazy shit happened.\n\nOk this is a total tangent, but I can\u2019t help myself but to reminisce on my favorite \u201cdrunk girls are basically a different species\u201d experiences.  I\u2019m at one of these parties, hanging in the closest like I normally do while one girl I went to school with is getting wayyyy too drunk (she\u2019s 14 so probably not actually that drunk).  \n\nAnd naturally, she starts crying about god knows what.  Comes into our little den and is just bawling incoherently when her nose starts to drip.  I\u2019m talking one of those loose, wet, transparent drips.  And as she\u2019s talking it\u2019s just dripping down her face basically to the point of going over her mouth while she\u2019s wailing about god knows what and the rest of the sober closet kids are looking at each other bewildered.  Then her phone rings and she ANSWERS it.  Sniffs her snot straight up into her nose.  Has a completely coherent conversation with her parents.  Hangs up.  And immediately the snot comes back out and she starts crying again. \n\nAnywho\u2026 I would often stay pretty late because I lived close by so could walk home if needed and I was pretty transparent with my parents about what was going on (and how I wasn\u2019t participating in the alcohol, etc) and so they trusted me and would pick me up if I needed.\n\nWell one of those parties I\u2019m chilling in the closet like I usually do and the party has winded down a bit, so there\u2019s only a handful of people left - including obviously the host and her side kick friend.  \n\nWhat seemed like generally out of nowhere, they both stormed into my little closest, closed the door behind them and more or less started mauling me without saying anything.  This is where I\u2019ll admit they were not necessarily the most beautiful girls id seen at the time, but this felt like something you just rollled with and early teens me wasn\u2019t about to be picky.\n\nThings are progressing.  My pants are starting to come off.  And then again from outside I hear a shout: \u201cWHERE\u2019S OP!  HIS MOM\u2019S HERE TO PICK HIM UP.\u201d\n\nApparently my phone had died earlier and so my mom decided to come by to make sure I was ok. I\u2019ve lived a full life and never since had an opportunity to successfully execute a FFM threesome (and I tried in college ha).  It still haunts me now.",

I still to this day cannot believe it, but I kept texting her and somehow made the decision to just go to sleep rather than go and hangout with my crush.

She didn't know I was in to her so things weren't weird. I never assumed she had any feelings towards me either. She had just broken up with her boyfriend at the time and was pretty miserable about it. She made some comment about how she wanted to just make out with someone random just to get over it. I replied saying she should pick someone she knows and trusts so nothing goes bad and she agreed with me. Conversation slowly moved away from that and I went to go grab my jacket and asked if she wanted to come with so we could keep talking. She came with. She texted me the next day playfully telling me I was a fucking idiot because she thought I was pulling her away from the party to make a move. Tried to make a move after that and she shut me down saying it would be weird for the friendship. Still think about it.",

We had always spent time together because my friend was going out with the girl who\u2019s house it was and I felt like we were getting closer to become more then friends. After the party we came home kind of drunk but not crazy drunk, I ended sleeping in the bed with this girl whilst her friend was on the floor with her Bf kissing all night. I laid there for like 2 hours with a chub as she was only in her underwear! After a while she ended up turning over to face me, our lips were 0.5mm away from each other and I still never made the move. She had her eyes closed with her mouth open, her breath was beaming on my face. \n\nThinking back it was such a blatant ask for me to kiss her. What did I do?, I whispered night and turned around!!!!!!\n\nI still think about that to this day.",

      "text": "Junior year of high school I transferred to a new school. First day of school a really cute guy went out of his way to introduce himself (I\u2019ll call him \u201cC\u201d) and trying to get to know me. After years of bullying, sexual harassment, and isolation at my previous school, I had no idea what to think but instantly developed a crush. We only had a short study hall together but he talked to me everyday. At that point it was the best part of my day. After a week or so he started showing up in my pottery class. Then my English class. From my point of view I was in love with this boy and just happy to have a chance to talk to him a few times during the day but didn\u2019t think we were even really friends. \n\nSo halfway thru the school year another guy (whom I\u2019ll call \u201cR\u201d and was someone I had gone elementary school with but had never spoken to) told me he really liked me and we started spending time together. During the first few weeks of this \u201cC\u201d, showed up at my house late one night and asked to crash on the couch while his parents had some kind of sports thing going on at their house. At that point I don\u2019t think he had ever been to my house before. I don\u2019t remember much of what we talked about (pretty sure I was having an out of body experience at that point) all I remember was laying on the couch with him for awhile then he left.\n\nFrom there things got a bit weird for awhile. \u201cC\u201d, \u201cR\u201d, and I ended up in a group for an English project that was supposed to take a few weeks so ended up spending most evenings hanging out together. During that time \u201cR\u201d asked me out. As far as I was aware \u201cC\u201d didn\u2019t feel for me the way I felt for him so I started dating \u201cR.\u201d \n\nNear the end of the project I got an email from \u201cC\u201d (this was around 2003 so none of us had cellphones at that point) telling me about a girl that he had feelings for but who with someone else and asked me what he should do. I had no idea if he was referring to me but I told him the only thing he could do was to tell her it leave it be\u2026\n\nThat was the last conversation I can remember having with him. After that he kinda disappeared from my life. He started taking classes at the local CC for early credit. Transferred out of the classes we shared and stopped communicating with me. I was devastated. Even 20 years later it still hurts to think about it. \n\n\u201cR\u201d and I will celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary this year.\n\nSometimes women need things spelled out for them as well.",

She would put on porn all the time and we would joke about some of it. One day when we are hanging out she asks me to take a nap with her, which I was actually pretty tired so I obliged. We stripped to our underwear and cuddled into a spooning position. At this point she proceeds to tell me how much it hurt when she lost her virginity because her vagina is so tight and how she wants to try anal now because she thinks it wouldn't hurt as much (lol) but she wanted a guy who she really trusted to be the one to do it. I basically told her \"good luck finding him\" and went to sleep.\n\nLooking back at that I seriously feel like the scene at the end of Dumb and Dumber where the traveling bikini models ask for two guys to oil them up before competitions and they point them to the next town while thinking how lucky the two guys they find are going to be.\n\nThe worst part was that I wasn't even a virgin at this point, just a completely oblivious moron.
