  "text": "TIFU by surprising my man with something for Valentine\u2019s day\nMe (F24) and my boyfriend (M26) have a pretty Vanilla sex life. He likes to do the regular stuff he\u2019s used to but I want to switch it up sometimes. Sometimes he does but it\u2019s like he\u2019s not really into it so we just do the regular stuff. \n\nFor a couples weeks now i\u2019ve been setting up a threesome with me and my friend for him. She was down with it and she\u2019s leaving this city so we won\u2019t see her anymore and we could just forget about the whole thing (so i thought). \n\nValentine\u2019s day comes and he\u2019s surprising me the whole day with flowers, gifts, food, clothes, yada yada. The last thing he had planned for us was dinner and it was amazing. We\u2019re heading back home and i\u2019m texting my friend making sure she set everything up and she\u2019s ready for us to come in. \n\nWe get home, go in and the room is set up so nice. Rose petals, Hennessy (I think that\u2019s where i messed up) and tree. We played a drinking game and smoked and then we were getting into it. everything was good at first but then they started getting like TOO into each other. \n\nHe\u2019s flipping her over and doing tricks and putting his leg up and moaning and grunting while i\u2019m getting the bare minimum. She\u2019s over there moaning and going crazy acting like it\u2019s the best dick she ever had in her life. the whole situation just made me uncomfortable so i ended up saying i was tired and we went to bed. \n\nI woke up this morning to cook for all of us and they were still just acting too friendly. laughing and touching and all that. she left a couple hours ago but he\u2019s glued to that phone now. He won\u2019t even let me see what he\u2019s doing on it either. fuck my life. \n\nTL;dr: don\u2019t have a threesome with your man he might just like the girl you brought more than you.\n\nedit: I\u2019m not mad about my boyfriend enjoying the threesome. I did it for him! I was just mad because he was ignoring me basically the whole threesome then was ignoring me and texting HER. I posted this on TIFU because I know this is on me. never asked for advice\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd.\n\nupdate: We talked about it and I just told him how i just didn\u2019t expect the night to go like that, i got jealous, and I felt like he wasn\u2019t showing me enough attention. He told me he just \u201cgot excited\u201d because he knew it was a one time thing, hes sorry and maybe threesomes aren\u2019t for us lmfao. I showed him that nobodies better than the original -*joseline voice*- and as far as the texting, he said he\u2019s not texting her so i\u2019m just going to trust him and forgot about that.\n\nedit 2: IM BISEXUAL! I like girls and my boyfriend is the first man i ever dated. It was definitely supposed to be a threesome, not 2 straight girls and 1 straight guy. they just excluded me. tbh i think she\u2019s not as gay as she says but that\u2019s on me.",

IMO an important part of achieving PIV orgasm is making the gal really want penetration during foreplay. I usually won't stop foreplay till I've got her asking/begging for it.\n\nAs for moving your hips back and forth, I think your bf at the time didn't understand how good it can feel if you can both synchronize your hip gyrations. At least in my experience it's always better when she can get her hips moving at the right time. Takes two to tango and whatnot. Hope things have gotten better for you since!",

Normally we do this doggy, and I just go really slowly alone his shaft. Sometimes I pull all the way away then push back so he enters me again. It\u2019s sexy as all fuck and it feels so, so good. I do it for as long as I can stand, which is usually only about 2-3 minutes before I\u2019m ready to go at it hammer and tongs. At that point, I tell him he can move, and we just fuck so hard like crazed animals for a few minutes, then it\u2019s over. It\u2019s so fucking hot going slow and being in total control up until that point that it doesn\u2019t take long for either of us to finish. \n\nI love having that power of making him stay still, but that\u2019s so I can control the movement and do the slow, slow movement. If he starts moving, I move forward out of his reach and he gets a little \u201ctime out\u201d, maybe 10-20 seconds or so. But after that first slow part where he\u2019s not allowed to move, I want him to fuck me really hard and put in the work matching my rhythm, like usual. It\u2019s just so, so good to fuck like rabbits after the slow build up. \n\nWe certainly don\u2019t do this every time we have sex, maybe 1 in 10 times. All the other times he can move and do whatever he wants. But sometimes it really sexy and exhilarating to be in completely control where he\u2019s not allowed to move, and I \u201cpunish\u201d him by pulling away if he does. But that\u2019s all part of this particular style, and he doesn\u2019t have to stay still the whole time. I think I like the power and control as much as I like the slow, full length in and out sliding on and off his cock. It\u2019s so completely different to him just being a \u201cstarfish\u201d and laying there lifeless. He\u2019s telling me the whole time how amazing it feels, and how much he wants to fuck me hard. I love hearing how hard it is for him to keep still, somethings to the point where he begs me to let him move. But I say no until I\u2019m ready. It doesn\u2019t take that long, but holy hell does it feel good, and the frenzy after all the build up is completely worth it.",

I needed to lay still, no touching, no moving and she closed her eyes and was just concentrated on herself.\n\nSex is usually something you experience together, you move and touch and your partner moves and touches. Sure everyone is doing what he or she needs to do, to orgasm, but at the same time everyone SHOULD do what he or she thinks to please the partner and makes him or her orgasm. Ideally, you make your partner orgasm and your partner makes you orgasm. The lust of your partner is the goal, not your own lust.\n\nAnd yes, if a guy is just concentrated on himself, just thrusting in and out for his own pleasure, without any concerns whether that is pleasing the woman:\n\nThis is exactly the same thing. And the guy is only using the woman as a sex toy. \n\nThe difference is, that my girlfriend then only could orgasm doing so, so this is the reason it was ok for me. A pillow with a dildo strapped on or me wouldn't have made a difference, that's why I said, I felt somewhat like a sex toy.",

Because lots of women can\u2019t orgasm from PIV sex only (about 70% I believe, I\u2019m so glad I\u2019m in the minority with this one) but they can still orgasm with their male partner, if he goes down on them or rubs her clit etc. It\u2019s not fair to blame the man or say \u201cmen\u201d when you\u2019re just talking about PIV sex. Most women need clitoral stimulation to orgasm, that is true, and PIV doesn\u2019t really stimulate the clit. But a reasonable percentage of men know this and will happily give the needed clitoral stimulation if you guide them on what to do. It\u2019s different for all women (as I\u2019m sure you know), so what worked with their last partner won\u2019t necessarily work for the current one. \n\nThe vast majority of men I slept with will happily go to town on my clit when they know I\u2019m enjoying it, and I give feedback on what works and what doesn\u2019t. It probably helps that I\u2019m happy to do pretty much all of what they want too. You can\u2019t really expect to say \u201cI don\u2019t do blowjobs\u201d but still have the man go down on you. Everyone is entitled to their own boundaries of course (I don\u2019t do anal anymore for example) but if you\u2019re not willing to do it for your partner, you can\u2019t be surprised or offended if they\u2019re not willing to do it for you.",

Communication can help but at the end of the day if the non monogamous element upsets you then no amount of talk will fix that. It's very common in these stories for people to just not know themselves well enough to accurately predict their response. You also can't predict how your partner will find the sex with the other person.

If you're ever curious and try it out, I encourage you to remember that and make a sincere effort to stray away from that tendency that a lot of people tend to give. \n\nA really easy way to introduce coming into threesomes is for two people to have a strict intention of pleasuring the one. That way there is once center of focus for both people, and the vibe is generally a lot easier without anyone feeling like they are getting left out. \n\nI also typically don't recommend bringing a new partner into an established couple for a threesome. ***ESPECIALLY*** if they don't have a strongly established sexual attraction to both people. Because that person is going to trend towards just giving the person they're attracted to their attention, and the other is going to be left in the cold. \n\nIt's way better for each person to have their own sexual relationship with the third since that typically goes over way better when everyone is together.",

I  find people tend to match the behavior of their partner, so maybe the friend was just more exciting in the sack and OP's BF was inspired.\n\nAlternatively it's important to communicate. Porn is how most guys are educated in sex at first, so if OP's man has observed that in most of these scenes that the women tend to get frisky to offset him being focused on one girl at a time, that could also be it.\n\nThere's also a commonly discussed phenomenon in the swinger community that people are oftentimes way dirtier with people other than their partner, then revert back to more intimate sex after the rando's are gone.\n\nSome people, both men and women like to watch. Maybe OP assumed that was the case. Maybe the way OP said \" surprise I want you to fuck my friend\" gave her BF the impression she just wanted them to go at it with her being less involved.\n\nIt all comes down to communication and being clear about what you want, even if in the moment you're having a hard time managing the emotions it will only improve if you clearly communicate your needs and then commit your body language and touch to supporting what you say.\n\nEdit: the texting piece is a bit immature, but it's also equally likely he's telling his boys about it and doesn't want OP to know.",

But a lot of (even very sex positive and adventurous) women I've talked to said they don't really emjoy watching porn - watching sex they're not actively participating in feels awkward /uncomfortable/lonely. On the other hand, very few guys say they don't like any porn.",

A bit of good dirty talk can keep everyone on the up and up with boundaries, needs and desires should they shift during sex while not sounding like a clinical discussion.  Asking your partner(s) what they want with a sultry tone should be sex 101.  Done right, you can establish informed, on-going consent, can voice your intentions and desires, encourage your partner(s) to do the same, and _not_ make the whole thing seem like transactional sex.\n\nI guess in addition to weed and booze I did take a bump of coke before my first threesome so maybe I did get cleared up a bit before the action started.",

In fact, for a lot of people, I'd highly recommend this be the experience of your first threesome because it's super clear what the goals are and you don't have to worry about leaving anyone out because....it's just the one person that is receiving everything. You *have* to agree upon that before things heat up and go into it with that frame of mind, but in my experience it can be really amazing. \n\nCoincidentally, I think this is a primary reason why a lot of MMF threesomes tend to have way less horror stories attached to them. I have no stats to back that up, but in my experience with that and being the bottom of a gang bang and stuff, you're pretty much the focus of all of the attention. FFF threesomes are also typically really successful with that approach I've found, since I had a partner for a while that liked to tie women up and we had a lot of fun getting friends off as a tag team effort. I've had experiences outside of that that have worked as well, but there's nothing wrong with just wanting to focus on one person if that is the goal that everyone is on board with.\n\nSo it really depends. I've also had group sex that ended up being really awkward and I straight up don't play with heterosexual couples together anymore because unless I have a sexual relationship with both partners, things are just bound to get awkward I feel. A lot of monogamous relationships straight up can't handle non monogamous sex.",

This guy is going to have a laundry list of things going through his (as OP indicated) intoxicated mind in a very short amount of time. Dude could be worrying ab alcohol/drug induced ED, being premature, or just straight up not thinking clearly at all. I know it\u2019s speculation, but here\u2019s a possible look into this dude\u2019s mind in the moment:\n\n\u201cHoly shit okay this is happening. I\u2019m gonna have a threesome! Okay. What do I do? Is it okay that I\u2019m touching her? My girlfriend seems cool with it. How do I keep them both satisfied? What if I cum too soon and don\u2019t satisfy this new girl? Maybe I should try and pay attention to her first. I hope I don\u2019t cum too soon. Am I just wasting her time? Does she like me? What if she laughs at me? What if I ruin this for my girlfriend? It was her idea after all. Holy shit I can\u2019t believe this is happening. I hope I\u2019m doing okay. Man this will probably never happen to me again. Holy shit I\u2019m having a threesome! I need to make sure that she gets off or else she\u2019ll probably laugh at me. I hope she is having a good time. Am I doing a good job? I don\u2019t know this girl all that well, but she seems into it? Have I touched my girlfriend in a bit? I can\u2019t remember, but this was her idea after all. I don\u2019t wanna fuck this up for her OR her friend. Holy shit. What am I gonna tell MY friends!? Woah what is that thing she just did? Man that felt good. Hey wait where is my girlfriend going? I hope she\u2019s okay. Man I\u2019m fucked up. Am I being rude if I leave to check on my girlfriend? Holy shit I can\u2019t believe this is happening!\u201d\n\nI mean that\u2019s just an example. I sincerely doubt that any intoxicated and vanilla individual with no group sex experience who had a second girl sprung on him with zero time to prepare for the experience would perform much better. I can\u2019t honestly say that I would under similar circumstances. I can totally believe his explanation that he just got too excited in the moment and forgot himself. And in all likelihood, the dude was probably glued to his phone the next morning because he was bragging to his friends about how awesome it was and how cool his girlfriend is for bringing this chick over.\n\nI admit that I\u2019m doing a lot of speculating here, but all in all I think it seems way more likely than him purposefully ignoring his girlfriend who he clearly loves (sounds like he really knocked his portion of V-Day out of the park) or suddenly falling out of love with his girlfriend and straight into love with new girl. If I were OP, I\u2019d make a mental note to discuss things better beforehand if she ever decides to do this with him again. Let him AND the new girl know about some of the etiquette you expect beforehand and tell them that you\u2019d have a better time if you were really involved. If dude ignores her again, then okay - maybe there\u2019s an issue. But for now, I think OP should take this experience at face value and cut the dude a bit of slack. Unless he\u2019s a total douche (which doesn\u2019t seem to be the case from OP\u2019s tone and edits), he probably was doing the best he could in a crazy and stressful situation.",

I understood though, because obv her friend knew my wife better than me, and I think they had hooked up in the last before my wife and I knew each other. \n\nHeh the most awkward part was 3 people trying to sleep in a queen-sized bed afterward. So. Much. Body heat! Lol I eventually gave up and moved to the guest bedroom. \n\nOther than me occasionally cringing at some of the ways I acted during the \u201cfun part\u201d (I was much more \u201caggressive\u201d with her friend than I usually am with the wife, and in retrospect there should have been discussion with her friend beforehand about what was and wasn\u2019t acceptable/wanted behavior)\u2026 as far as I know, it didn\u2019t really have any positive or negative effect either on our relationship or her relationship with her friend.

It's not super complicated, but if you don't think it through, things get awkward *very* quickly.\n\nBy far the biggest mistake I see people make is bringing someone they know into the bedroom, and even more than that someone that has a sexual attraction to only one of the two other people in the bedroom. Even *worse* if that person is monosexual coming into a heterosexual couple's bedroom, meaning that person is either straight or gay, because at that point one person is essentially guaranteed to have minimum attention paid to them. \n\nIt's way healthier to explore sex with multiple partners at once with someone that either everyone already has a separate sexual relationship with, or at least someone who has a strong sexual attraction to all parties involved.",

I honestly question the relationship aspect of it.\n\nSkipping the toxicity part etc.\n\nI find it more of a fallacy in logic and basically just how we are as humans.\n\nHow do you define a \"relationship\" ? Like is it more intimate? Or.. is it sex? \n\nI have friends I've had sex with. We're still JUST friends. But we're not \"dating/married\" etc. So what part of the relationship makes it.. a relationship outside of friendship? The intimacy part? \n\nAt what point do we just say \"You're not in a relationship. You're just an open book who likes to share with everyone\" Which is.. entirely fine. But that shouldn't (or couldn't) equate to a monogamous relationship.\n\nThen comes the discussion of \"Well I love more than one person\" And again, this is fine. But are you equally loving everyone? Or is there a hierarchy? Is someone loved more than the other?  \nTo claim poly relationships figured this out would be.. crazy. Love triangles are already difficult to navigate. Especially with friends and jealousy and desires. On top of that, I love my friends, but I love my fiance more. But they're aware of it, and no one gets hurt by that because they have their own personal relationships. In a poly relationship, imagine if someone said \"I love X more than you\" that.. will always hurt no matter how you prepare.\n\nThere's a LOT in a relationship that you just can't equally share. TO the point where I'd say poly relationships can be very toxic to the wrong people who get caught up into it and are basically treated as the \"third\" or \"fouth\" person etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot trying to be judgy. It's just the one thing I've NEVER understood and struggle to understand, and I'd really appreciate some guidance or understanding. Because every time I look at anyone talk about it, it's very much \"No we all love each other equally\" (and it's usually one person speaking for everyone). OR it's a complete fabrication, or feelings aren't being openly communicating. The success story lives on in the internet on a blog post, but a year later that relationship is gone. Hence why I've never really seen an actual successful one.",

Human emotions are complicated as it is, add sex and everything is just too complex to understand. Doesn't help seeing so many conflicting social media posts and stories.\n\nWhat exactly are the lines and boundaries between fwb and a committed relationship? What makes someone decide that someone is good for the physical stuff but not good for the emotional part? How do you just have sex with someone and meet with them on a regular basis outside of sex but somehow not develop some kind of bond?\n\nI hope I'm not coming off as judgmental, it's just that this is all very confusing to me as an adult who didn't get to explore that area in either high school or college like many of my friends and my parents never talked to me about these things as they're religious fundamentalists who always just expected me to marry a \"good girl, from a good family from back home,\" make a bunch of kids and live happily ever after.\n\nEDIT: fixed the quotes",

                                  "text": "So I can't give you the right answer.\n\nNeither can your parents, nor can anyone else.\n\nThe right answer is how you feel. (this is where I can admit, Poly relationships can be valid. I just can't understand it because I can't understand the feeling.)\n\nBut I can tell you what I've observed and what I feel is right.\n\nFWB vs committed relationship? Here's the simplest way to put it.\n\nFWB: One person will catch feelings. Eventually. What happens is, one person overstays... they connect, the find things in common.. they put the effort into seeing the other person. You start building a commitment. Often times.. the other person doesn't feel the same way, cuts ties.\n\nHere's how I still stayed friends with my FWB (not all). We called it off. We distanced ourselves, and didn't speak for a very long time until we got over each other (or the one who caught feelings did)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA committed relationship? To put bluntly. Two people put the effort  (or as some people call it 'work') to be together.\n\nLots of people equate \"work\" as \"the hard part\" aka \"we're fighting therefore this is healthy for the relationship\". But that... in my opinion, is wrong.\n\nI see people who say \"oh no we're just working at our relationship\" Yet they're arguing almost daily. That's... not healthy at all.  \n\nWork in a relationship is being present, aware, and constantly attentive. Where you work together \"against the world\". Let's say both people work, both come home and talk about their day. This isn't a \"I had it worse!!\" moment. This is a \"Im sorry how can I make it better\" moment. For both people. And the work is, putting your shit aside, to make their shit not seem so difficult. Ideally, they reciprocate that.. and put their shit aside, to make your shit not seem so difficult. \n\nThen you have the other things, like issues occurring, being able to confide in them, and they do the same with you. The very honest openness between two people.\n\nFighting with your SO in a commited relationship will happen. But putting the work in is not \"fighting\". It's about being able to empathize with them and trying to understand. It's trying to see their viewpoint instead of just your own. The \"work\" in relationships that are committed.. is very selfless. Again, both parties should be selfless to each other. You need to know what limits you have, and to prevent being used too. So there's a mental understanding of your own self you need to know. \n\nHence why people say you have to love yourself before you can love others. It's called self love, self respect and self analysis. It's not \"lol Im great. Therefore I can love others.\". It's truly about being able to respect yourself and your boundaries.\n\nThis is very key to not being abused or taken advantage of when it relates to being selfless. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSex has little to do with relationships. It's about intent. You can have sex with anyone. You can fantasize about anyone, you can watch porn etc. That doesn't make you have a relationship with them.  \nBut.. when you meet someone who you love, the sex becomes different. It becomes a moment of passion for that individual, where you desire them and the closeness.\n\nNow while I say that, don't go out seeking a relationship and faking yourself into feeling that. That's a bad thing. I've seen people desperate for affection doing that only to realize they are in a very bad place with that person.",

It's one thing to not have everything figured out, it's another to be starting from square one with absolutely no prior experience and in my situations just be expected to get it.\n\nLike where do I even meet people? I'm not exactly weird and uncomfortable around women, it's just there's something I can't quite explain. Like for whatever reason I can't see any woman passed being friends regardless of how attractive I think they are. Not that that's a bad problem to have, but ever since I was a teen, I've just had this itch that I can't find a cure for. And it's not sex. Not to sound like a meme, but for half of my life, I've been searching for something without so much as a clue of what that thing is.\n\nAnd no, I'm not asexual nor am I in the closet. I've confident that I'm heterosexual.\n\nGoing back to the fwb thing, it's not that I don't believe sex should be exclusive to a committed relationship it's just as you said, more often than not someone over stays their visit. I can understand a one night stand, but fuck buddies and fwbs are foreign to me. It seems weird to be able to get that close to someone on a regular basis and still be able to detach emotionally? \n\nI don't know, I'm all over the place and confused as hell and dating and sex are probably the least of my worries",

I\u2019m not from a super religious background or anything but I just never had the little innocent middle school relationship or the high-school relationship where you get all the first time awkwardness out and learn to be with a person for the first time. \n\nAround the first year of college I did have a bit of a thing going but it turned sour. We were not a good of a match as we thought in the first few months and broke that off. I\u2019m actually pretty interested in a FWB at the current moment. I\u2019m still inexperienced and I find that I would be most comfortable with a friend, someone I trust and respect to help me gain more experience. I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship by any means. I\u2019m still very young and I have a lot of aspirations  and a committed relationship isn\u2019t currently one of them. I want to have fun. I don\u2019t think I can do that with a stranger. I feel that the current state of the world has some to do with the fact that I just want to have fun. I feel like I missed out in middle school, high-school and now college. These past two years would\u2019ve been prime opportunity for me to casually date with no real commitment. Just having pure fun and creating memories. \n\nI also relate to you in that when I see a guy I can\u2019t really imagine a romantic relationship. I just see a guy. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know how to talk to people. Also, guys do come up to me and strike up conversation but I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ll ever be comfortable enough until I have more experience. I guess I have some mental block around the fact that most people my age have had at least 1 or more serious relationships and definitely have had more than 1 sexual partner. Feels like I\u2019m crawling and they\u2019ve done a marathon. I don\u2019t know if that added anything to your question or answered anything but just some input from a different side",

That doesn't mean one doesn't get any love. But to claim it's equal isn't true.\n\nThe other thing is, children and parent love is different than... between two people. It's definitely under the scope of love but, it's more of a nurturing and caring love rather than a passion and trust love that comes from an intimate relationship.\n\nSo that's why I had to define relationship and love in what context. There's friendship love, there's parental love etc. These are different loves and they hold different values and hierarchies.\n\nFor example: A mother would likely protect her children than her friend because she loves her children more than her friend so the priority is different.\n\nBut within a relationship/intimate love. How can you truly be equal in love? To me.. it's unfathomable. There's a lot of people who are \"emotionally unavailable\" and thats due to being tied up elsewhere with emotions.\n\nYou can love a spouse that passed away, and you likely won't love another person. You're emotionally unavailable to the other person at that moment. Could that shift? Yes, absolutely. But then you now have changed the \"heirarchy\" of who you love more. If you consider them equals, then are you still mourning while with someone else or have you \"moved on\" Etc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI moved the subject away from poly for a few examples, because these emotions are complex for monogamous relationships alone. When you add more people into these relationships.. you start to realize, it gets messier fast.\n\nIt's not to say \"OMG YOU HAVE TO MARRY ONE PERSON AND LOVE THEM\" it's more so.. Poly relationships aren't as functional as people claim it to be. We're literally so shit at managing our own emotions, that even monogamous relationships struggle with miscommunication and everything that goes into a simple relationship. And now that you add more people into the mix, you're bound to have more complications. Within these complications, you'll likely to be more biased towards one party... hence why it's impossible to have equal love.\n\nEven within simple monogamous relationships, one person loves the other person more. You have to clarify and figure that out as you proceed and accept that. Again, adding more people to the mix, makes it harder to figure out and understand.",

Some kids will either command more attention because of their personality or simply require it because of disorders they have no control over (ADHD, autism etc).\n\nI think it is kind of the same for poly relationships. You have your closest friends, then there are your work buddies and then your acquaintances etc. Which is not to suggest that poly relationships are inherently toxic unless everyone is receiving equal attention. I think it's perfectly fine if people are ok being the 2nd, 3rd, 4th partner etc.\n\nAll I'm saying is that I think a perfectly equal poly relationship is about as rare as those 30+ year marriages some people's grandparents have.",

I think it\u2019s critical that all parties are independently poly, as in they identify as poly individually. A lot of people claim poly but have no understanding of Ethical NonMonagmy (ENM). My husband and I were both poly before we started our relationship as we don\u2019t see love (including romantic love) as a finite resource. Poly is all about managing time, energy, and emotional availability. \n\nI respect anarchic poly, but that is not for me and I don\u2019t emotionally understand it. A lot of poly people hate on any hierarchy, but to me that seems like a denial of how people form relationships (of any kind). My partner and I both need stability as we have many health issues and the Primary system works for us. We are very upfront about our relationship being our base of support and our mutual life-plan coming first. If one of us needed to close the relationship (for any reason) we would do so whether temporarily or permanently, but we always try to address the root problem if our needs are not being met. To say I don\u2019t prioritize our relationship would be a lie and I am very open about this with potential partners. \n\nThat said, we are supportive of each other\u2019s other relationships and actively work to integrate the people we love into our lives. I\u2019ve never dated anyone who hasn\u2019t been willing to get to know him, that is a strong boundary for me (as well as making surd any partner\u2019s other partners are firmly onboard). I actually just ended a relationship because when I talked to my metamour they were clearly struggling and had needs that weren\u2019t being met. \n\nI don\u2019t think there is a lot of merit to trying to love people equally. My love for different people is different, not better or worse. I love to support my partners and my husband also wants to know and be there for them. Each relationship is part of our family and we support each other in that way. Those relationships are all unique and I don\u2019t see much point in trying to distribute those finite resources equally when we all have unique needs. If one person needs support we are all there for each other. Each struggle in life for each person is something we all take on. \n\nI hope I\u2019m communicating this in a helpful way. I will happily answer any questions you have :)\n\nEdit: I have had threesomes, etc and communication is key. Not all have gone well, and I don\u2019t actively seek them out, but when they naturally occur it is important that all parties feel cared for in the way they need.",

This is going to sound like the poly vs open relationship.\n\nThe way you say your husband and yourself started the relationship and don't see love as a finite resource that's fair. I mean I love all my friends, but I don't love them the same way I love my partner.\n\nIf you're poly, what made you choose your husband instead.. well another person? Does that mean you explicitly love your husband more? And your husband loves you more than others?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPrioritizing your relationship with your husband, and the same goes for him with you. Wouldn't this just mean you're in an open relationship? Where the 3rd or 4th  etc.parties are not as important, but you have other partners?  \n\n\nI only ask this because you brought up sex. (threesomes and what not)\n\nYou also mention that you prioritize your husband, and that relationship more than other partners. Then your metamour was struggling so you ended it.\n\nTo me, it seems that love is a finite resource then. Their needs were not met. That's part of love. You can try to manage things as best as you can, but you'll always have to split. Let's assume monogamous = 100% time for the other person. In a 2:1 you have a 50% split. 3:1 33% split etc.  (you get the point).  \nIf you change that split, someone is now \"less involved\" and it seems that love is finite.\n\n You can't love 3 people 100% the same way, since time and effort are things we have a finite amount of. \n\nWhich results in why I believe poly relationships to fail. Yours didn't but that's because I'd claim you're in a monogamous relationship that's open. The metamour is someone you can easily cut off, and same with your husband. But could you cut your husband off for the metamour, or your partner? This is where I see the entire love is limited part. You've chosen your husband as primary, and everyone else is secondary. This just sounds more so like an open relationship.",

                                      "text": "My husband and I found each other after having experienced extreme hardships (health related) very young in life, both having to give up our dream jobs. We share foundational beliefs about what is right and what people should strive to be as well as very similar perspectives on the reality we live in; I would not be able to date someone without class consciousness, no \u201cbootstraps\u201d nonsense, for instance. Importantly, he is also willing to challenge me intellectually and to be the best version of myself. He\u2019s everything I admire in a person. Our lives broke in complicated ways that happen to make us fit perfectly together. \n\nI knew he was \u201cmy person\u201d the first week we were together. I had never in my life wanted to get married and hated the institution of marriage (this is heavily impacted by my parents growing up of course). I had multiple long term relationships, but never felt anything near marriage levels of trust and affection. I had always given myself ample emotional space in relationships and made myself believe I wouldn\u2019t want to rely on someone (survival tactic from childhood abuse). Being with him I just knew I\u2019d found the person I could be \u201cme\u201d with. I\u2019ve learned self-love by seeing myself through his eyes. \n\nHe also made me very mushy (as is evidenced above), I used to be far my cynical. \n\nTo answer your question, yes I love my husband more than any other human being including family. It\u2019s because I\u2019m able to loving him fully with every part of myself and that is a unique type of love to me. And yes he feels the same. \n\nRegarding open relationships: yes there are people that would qualify as both open relationships and poly, but generally speaking open relationships are one romantic partner, multiple sexual partners. Where with poly the ideas is all or none or any number in between of your relationships can be serious and romantic. Ethical NonMonogamy is often involved in open relationships, but not always; in poly it is required. My other partner (and a few past partners and friends) make up my family. They are my world and they know that I treasure having them in my life. These relationships are comfortable because they understand my relationship with my husband and are not seeking to fill that role. That would be uncomfortable to me and I need my parter to respect the place my husband has in my life, while understanding there is plenty more room for them. \n\nAnd I currently have one other partner (sadly long distance right now, but he\u2019s trying to move back to our area). He is extremely close with my husband, they have their own (platonic) relationship and they spend time together without me as well. I just left another relationship because I have a boundary (which is a rule I set for myself) that I will not be with someone whose other partner is not fully onboard or is uncomfortable with the situation. It sucks and they definitely have some stuff they need to work out, but it was the right thing to do for everyone involved. \n\nAnd to be clear my metamour is the person my ex was dating and he considers them his primary. I talked with them after I had raised some concerns and they admitted they had a deeply embedded fear of being replaced (history of trauma) and that even though they logically knew that wasn\u2019t happening it was disrupting their life. They had not shared this with my ex until then and I took that as a cue to give them distance (break up, but still be available as a friend) and let them sort out some things in their relationship. I was not the only metamour and it feels like my ex was ignoring warning signs that things weren\u2019t okay, which does not feel good I won\u2019t lie. I hope they spend some quality time working on what they want from their relationship and reestablishing any damaged trust. \n\nI still love my ex, but since his relationship with his primary is being impacted I have to love him from a distance. I\u2019m still working to help him get the mental health resources he needs (as is my husband) and we are still there for him. I just recognized that our romantic relationship was causing a problem for the meta and I will still love him if we can\u2019t be together again. For me it is very hard to stop loving someone. I still love my high school sweetheart (he knows, we\u2019re good friends) and even my abusive ex. It took me over a year after leaving to get properly mad at what he did to me and still I am devastated for him for the horrible situation he\u2019s put himself into. But I know that nothing good will come from trying to maintain a (platonic) relationship (which I learned the hard way). So sometimes I feel love or gratitude for the person he used to be before the drugs. I\u2019m still learning to manage those feelings when I can\u2019t put them back into any sort of relationship with him. Sorry for the tangent. \n\nI personally agree you can\u2019t love three people equally and exactly the same \u201camount.\u201d But how much time I spend with them does not directly translate into how much I love them or how loved they feel. Some people are low emotional maintenance and only need small check ins or we end up organically talk when something the other person would be interested in is on our radar. Or when they have a big thing they are excited for they need full attention, but will go days doing their own thing. Or it\u2019s the little, silly conversations that make them feel cared for. Or being able to pause everything and be there for them while going through something challenging. Different people have different needs. And I am very open about my limitations, both as a person and as someone else\u2019s primary. \n\nI can\u2019t be everything to another partner, but at this point in my life I can recognize that I have a lot of compassion and enthusiasm to share with others that is valuable too. I like that I am able to have a variety of different types of relationships based off what we are both interested in. The people I date are also poly and/or aren\u2019t looking for a full-time relationship (ex: FWB). I need \u201cfull-time,\u201d I need the \u201cspend everyday together\u201d sappy stuff which is why I have a primary; but since I have that foundational support I can also be close to people with different attachment styles. Each relationship is unique and I think each person gets a different part of me in our relationship. And I get a unique relationship with them. And altogether we are a united and supportive family structure.",

Friendship love exists. I love my friends and they're there for me when my fiance isn't. Same with her friends etc.\nHow come it turns into a \"family and intimate relationship\" love?\n\nWe hear the term that friends are the family you choose. But does that mean you're poly because you treat friends closely? \n\nThis is where that muddy part is.\nYou say you have your primary for all that sappy stuff etc.\nAnd you dislike marriage and were broken etc.\nSame with your husband being broken at the time. \n\nDo you consider that this emotional bonding is monogamy and you just are empathetic and care about others around you? \n\nI say these things not because I disagree with poly. It's that poly seems so vast and vague that it basically encompasses everything. And thus has such a loose definition you can apply it to everything. \nYou could claim that a relationship is now poly because you got married and your inlaws love you. Therefore are they part of the poly relationship? \nTheyre just low maintenance or don't need as much etc.\n\nLike what differentiates relationships? If you say poly is loving others.. but you love someone more than someone else, doesn't that just sound like monogamy but you have love for others..? The same way I love my friends and my fiance. But I love my fiance more. That doesn't make me poly. That just makes me empathetic and caring and loving.",

I honestly don\u2019t care too much about what \u201ctype\u201d or love I\u2019m experiencing. I identify romantic and sexual feelings and describe that type of intimacy accordingly. Romantic and sexual feelings carry a lot of potential for hurt if there isn\u2019t some understanding that is met and boundaries aren\u2019t respected. Therefore it makes sense to formalize those types of relationships so that expectations are discussed and no one feels like they are being neglected. That level of understanding is needed in a relationship context. \n\nSure, I have friends where we\u2019ve discussed mutual boundaries *if they become an issue,* but for the most part that isn\u2019t an assumed step in friendship. My closest friends are as close as my partners, they just don\u2019t have a sexual or romantic component. That love is not less than my relationships, it\u2019s just different. With my other partner I feel our love is grounded in years of friendship and support, but since we give each other warm fuzzies, are sexually active, and have discussed our roles in each other\u2019s lives we deem that worthy of distinction. The distinction is to help others understand our seriousness and intent and to be able to return to in case we need to adjust boundaries.",

Expression of your own needs and how they are not being met is helpful by not putting pressure on them and also helps you clarify your own feelings.  \nBy not questioning the \"amount\" someone loves you, the focus can be placed in practical things like time spent together, physical contact, or whatever your love language is.  \n\nThe idealized polyamory situation, where all parties love each equally, relies on everyone being proactive enough to make their needs known and to take care of the needs of another.  \n\nBut, the majority of people still have this all-or-nothing combined with the \"valuation\" of love.  The \"ideal\" poly situation is not the only one and dating a couple should be more represented, as it actually fits modern life quite well since many of us want aome stability, without having to settle down.",

Now, imagine the fruit of this orchid, a pod, being picked and cured, sitting in the sun all day, sweating under blankets all night for\u00a0months until shrunken and shriveled it develops a heady, exotic perfume and flavor. Now, imagine that this fruit's name is synonymous with dull, boring and ordinary. How vanilla got this bad rap, I for one will never know.\"",

Even though I would place myself well into the kink territory, even to the point where I was a professional dominatrix and exotic dancer for a portion of my life, vanilla is *fabulous*.\n\nI don't like to think of vanilla as boring or bland. I like to think of vanilla as the ice cream flavor you can put so much on top of *if you want to*. Melted chocolate and sprinkles or whipped cream and gummies....so many possibilities to explore! *On top of vanilla!!!!* Vanilla itself is still absolutely delicious and savory and I love to eat it on it's own, just like how I love to have sex that is in private, with one person, with no toys and no kinky stuff. I love impassioned, romantic, and slow sex with the candles on where we gently express our love for each other through physical pleasure as much as I love getting beaten till I cum, as much as I love bottoming for a gang bang, etc. \n\nThat stuff isn't for everyone, and that's *fine*. You don't *need* those things to have a fulfilling sex life. And you shouldn't force yourself to try to put things on your ice cream that you don't want, or don't feel ready for. And especially since you are sharing your bowl of ice cream with another person, a person you may be romantically invested in no less, it's worth talking about what toppings you might want or not want before you start doing things. \n\nI'm really playing out this analogy, but it's just so important I think. So many monogamous couples in particular just straight up don't think these things through and get hurt in the process, and it's super unfortunate.",

Every time I read something on here, there's hardly any communication done and that's always gonna be where it falls apart. Surprises and spontaneity are great, but take 2 minutes at least to stop and be like \"What will and will not hurt my partner.\" \n\nAlso, guys, if you find a girl that is willing to not only let you have a threesome, but to set it up with her friend, STOP PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE THIRD PARTY.

Didn't seem to bother her, as we both seemed to enjoy it and it happened again a few months later, again, without me having anything to do with it. \n\nIt was EXTREMELY unexpected because I didn't see my current gf being on board at all. She's socially awkward to a near extreme, plus I had just lost over 100 pounds and I figured she'd be worried about the obvious.  My ex is bi, and had promised a threesome when we were together but the plans always fell through, and I figured that was just a thing in the past. No idea what the hell they talked about in those 5 or so minutes I was out of the room, but, definitely not complaining. Luckily caused no hiccups, so I didn't find myself here telling a similar story.",

I just wanted them to meet each other, as there are few things I love more than seeing my partners bond and that is an important part of poly for me. The little schemers initiated while we were watching TV, after they had found they had an enormous amount in common, and wanted to watch me squirm with being overloaded with attention. I was surprised, but down. We did a lot together (including them with each other) and my then BF got tired and just chilled while she fucked me. At one point he was cleaning lmao, I paused to check he was okay and he was like \u201cnah, just enjoying the entertainment.\u201d She stayed the night, we all cuddled. \n\nWe\u2019re still friends and while we lived near each other I went on some dates and overnights with her. I think it really depends on the level of trust and the fact we were all poly, not just monogamous asking a friend to join. For some relationship dynamics it\u2019s really not a problem to see your partner being into someone else, especially if you have a healthy approach to addressing an jealousy. Some people don\u2019t experience jealousy and just like to see their partners happy in whatever way works for them - but it\u2019s always a good idea to keep potential jealousy in mind while planning and be able to talk about it freely. \n\nEdit: also, aftercare. Have a private session after ;) That following morning with my husband was some of the best sex I\u2019ve had. It reaffirms your relationship and interest in each other.",

FWB and I were having brunch, GF was nearby also having brunch, but joined us after we were all drunkenly flirt-texting. We went to my place and honestly it was the sweetest and most fun I think I've had having sex. \n\nGF and I had a private session not long after as a sort of aftercare recalibration, but aside from that there were zero issues. 10/10 would do again.\n\nImo the reason this keeps being an issue is that strictly monogamous people get bored and think they want to poly play, but aren't ready to handle the complicated emotions that come with it. If you only fuck one person and think you might want to let that person fuck somebody else, be 100,000% certain in your relationship before you agree.",

I've never had that feeling of looking at someone and wanting to undress or have sex with them, in fact I find it kinda creepy that sometimes people look at others and all they can think about is what it'd be like to fuck them. I could never have sex again and it's not something I'd even really think about, unless prompted - sex is not something that comes to mind when I think about relationships.\n\nThere's a joke in the Ace community about Sex vs Cake and 9 times out of 10 I'd take the cake, lmao.",

And sometimes people who get together find out after a little bit that they aren't compatible in the long term. This doesn't mean either person is bad/inadequate/subpar, just incompatible. Then you be an adult, break up respectfully, and move on. That's life. Sometimes you get hurt. Sometimes you hurt others.

Hopefully by the time you think about marriage, you're as close as possible to being on the same page. \n\nEven then, as years go by, people can change. C'est la vie.",

The girl you brought back was a chance for him to live out the fantasies he is afraid to share with you. Being vulnerable in a relationship takes real courage, strength, and trust.\n\nAll these other posts are right, you need to talk to your man. He needs to talk to you, too. He might jerk off to crazy porn, fantasizing about choking and slapping you, tying you up, watersports, or who knows what else - and think that telling you any of that would make you think he was a deviant. He doesn't want to open up just to lose you.\n\nThis is coming from experience, where I have some real kinks but was afraid to go all in on the deep dark desires with my wife for a few years. After communicating directly about it she revealed her own fantasies, too. I never, ever thought there would be things she wanted that I was iffy about doing, or that she would say she wants some of the stuff I was afraid to admit being curious about before I could even say it to her. It's the ultimate relief, that level of sharing and trust.\n\n**He's interested in her right now because he knows she doesn't matter.** It's fun, but it isn't real and it is only temporary. You both need to talk and put your hearts and your kinks on the table with zero judgement. Real should be fun, too. Tell him what you want, and say you want to know what he wants, and that you won't laugh or recoil even if he thinks it's fucked up himself. You might not do everything, but you'll consider it openly and with love and respect.\n\nYou deserve to get what you want, too!",

If two consenting adults are down, then why not. \n\nWe did talk the hell out of it though. I remember a car ride back from the beach where we started to discuss it. At first jokingly then it was like well yeah. A few nights later she was like let's go out drinking and randomly was like hey... go flirt with that girl maybe we can bring her back. \n\nI was like WTF. Then I did. It was pretty epic. After the first we talked lightly about it and ignored it for weeks then we slowly began to discuss the scenario and after thoughts and we were like umm well, yeah we can do that. \n\nMy thoughts now are - what idiots we were to be so dismissing. It's not just to be corny or pretend our relationship is great, it's not, we have many downs and some ups but we have cool communication (now) and we totally do stuff like that. We have never had an issue over that. We even had someone try to split us up after a hookup because they wanted to go out with me and we both handled it.",

Somehow the jealously just disappeared. As well as most of my body shame. Now I would enjoy seeing my husband enjoy himself, even if it was with someone else (as long he still likes me best). Also my libido had skyrocketed, I'm getting into more kinky sex and I've become increasingly attracted to women as well. \n\nBut my husband isn't there. He is still the jealous type and I have asked him about threesomes (even with another woman only, no men) and he's still not ok with it.

Vice versa, but in the other case make sure to add thrusts, if you're GF is riding you then you want her to know you're into that part too. \n\nMaybe you don't like that, well try a double blowjob, or maybe do that porn thing where the girl are stacked on one another so you can alternate fucking them, or maybe get one of them to wear a strap on and you can try double penetration. \n\nJust do anything besides fucking the other girl as your GF watches unless you know for sure that her kink and she wants that. Keep everyone involved or at the very least just delegate the other girl to a supporting role rather than a main act.",

      "text": "Oh man\u2026\n\nSo when planning a 3some, it should never be a surprise to anyone. With you and all the other people involved, WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON AND WITHOUT DRUGS OR BOOZ, y\u2019all need to talk about boundaries, wants, and expectations. A safe word like how they use in kink wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea, so that if someone feels left out or whatever they can let it be known without it being a conversation. \n\nBTW if you can\u2019t bring yourself to have this conversation, then you should never ever attempt something like this. If you can\u2019t talk about what you want to do with the people you want to do it with, then you aren\u2019t ready to do it.\n\nThat said, whenever there\u2019s an odd number in a group sex situation, there will be moments where one person is left more as an observer. Sometimes you won\u2019t know how you feel until you get into that position, but you should be aware that you might be in that position and mentally prepare for it. This is why a safe word can be useful so you can \u2018tap in\u2019.\n\nAlso, the third in a 3some is not an NPC side character/supporting role. They are going in with their own fantasies and desires which everyone should be aware of and willing to accommodate. A huge problem that unicorns can find themselves in is when a couple uses them for their fantasies and leaves them unfulfilled because to the couple the sex was for them and they could care less about what the special guest star wants. \n\nAlso also, one night stands/one night of sex/stuff like this aren\u2019t throw away moments, even if they are not good experiences. Your BF and your friend shared an intimate encounter. She may be moving away but\u2026 well that doesn\u2019t mean either or both of them would or do think of that night as disposable as you expected them to. \n\nThis is one of them moments where you learn in hindsight. 3somes can work\u2026 but not the way that you did it. \n\nMy advice is to talk to your boyfriend, like really talk. He technically hasn\u2019t done anything wrong here, because you provided this experience. That said he may not realize how you were feeling then or now. If you don\u2019t hash this out and come to an understanding about how you both feel, (because his feelings may not be what you think they are) then this relationship is gonna tank for sure. This could be a moment you could grow closer\u2026 but only if you talk. \n\nThe mistakes you made here are classic blunders for folks who want to try 3somes. A \u201crule\u201d I have found that might help in the future is when considering stuff like this, as yourself and your partner \u201cwill this bring us closer together, or further apart?\u201d I don\u2019t think that question was asked here at all. \n\nLife lessons are always painful. Good Luck!",

Threesomes are usually more successful (and by that i mean don't cause long term issues in a relationship) with strangers than with people you are in a relationship with. Before I get downvoted into oblivion, read this whole comment.\n\nPeople in relationships, especially long term ones, can be sensitive in ways strangers are not. If you see two strangers laughing, your first thought isn't \"are they laughing at me?\" Or if you see two strangers share a look, you're not likely to care if they have plans to hook up later. Or if they do something you aren't familiar with or comfortable with, you won't see them in a negative light.\n\nWhen you are in a relationship, everything your partner does with someone who isn't you (either romantically or sexually) will weigh on you if you don't have a strong sense of self and 100% comfortable in your place in the relationship. You'll second guess every glance, every touch, every action that he/she has never used on you. It is an experience that millions of men and women are curious about, but few ever navigate successfully.\n\nBased solely on this post, I have to assume that you didn't think this through. I wish you well, but honestly I don't think you get through this without talking to a professional.",

He does need to be rained in and he needs to understand your feelings and what you need right now but it's not healthy to think of him as maliciously throwing away what you have together. It's more like a child that's ignoring what's important to play with the new toy.

Even if he completely ignored you, before, during, and after, this isn't on him, it's 100% on you.  \n\nI get the sinking feeling you are probably going to take it out on him, even though this entire situation was your making.  Hopefully you've learned relationships are about communicating, not surprise pushing of boundaries. (and I hope you don't in any way take this out on him by making him feel bad or guilt tripping him - that would be super abusive on your part)",

If OP confronts him, he'll only feel more pressured by her and more attracted towards the contrast of having been made to feel like \"the best dick\".\n\nI think OP should self-contemplate a bit about how she approaches her BF sexually. Her BF might come around quickly if she herself would also treat him like the best dick and approach sexual stuff without being pressuring.\n\nHer BF didn't create the situation, turning it all into his fault would be a very toxic thing to do and probably almost certainly kill the relationship rather than fix anything. Having a partner doesn't stop people from being sexually attracted to others, sexual attraction + opportunity happened. Learn from it, see if the relationship is still viable and then move on. Negative drama only pushes him towards the positive no-drama experience.",

In most situations you'd be absolutely 1000% right to suggest the talk, but in this particular case it's unlikely to yield a positive outcome. If they'd have to talk about something, it would be the aftermath, like him texting her and if it naturally flows well, only then perhaps talk about that night itself. And I'd even call that risky, better yet, starting from how he feels, so for what appears to be the first time in this story, he'd be able have his say for once.\n\nWhat I would call toxic and unhealthy is the combination of pushing sexual experimentation + arrange things without communication + pressuring him afterwards about the whole thing = making it all about her wishes at every step. What he wants and feels hasn't come up anywhere. As though he's a playtoy being beaten from one side to other with drama at every step.\n\nBut yes, communication is very important, but communication can be toxic too when it's a part of a quite one-sided story. Imagine being him: experiencing all this and then again getting \"questioned\" and guild-tripped - perhaps strong terms, but a likely consequence in effect.\n\nI understand where you're coming from and generally I'd agree with you, but not in the particular context of this case.",

A choice to commit yourself to that person more than others. To trust that person with more of your vulnerabilities than others. To spend more energy making that person happy than you would with others. To be willing to go farther outside your comfort zone to make the relationship work than with others. The connection is a feeling of trust and safety and commitment.  \n\n\nObviously, you wouldn't choose to commit yourself like this to a person you don't feel a connection to, but it's my opinion that you could have an incredible relationship that you are truly happy and satisfied with that lasts your whole life with a huge number of people, including friends you've had for decades. It's just about luck, the person you pick first, compatibility, and then the level that you commit yourself to the success of that relationship.",

Parent-child relationships are (ideally) basically unconditional on the part of the parent, and receiving nearly unconditional love is a totally unique experience.\n\nSibling relationships are also different because they KNOW every dark annoying secret. You can't really pretend to be someone you're not with them because they know you too well and so that results in a different dynamic.\n\nYou might not consider putting in the energy to be a better person as worth it for the family because you feel they will kinda accept you for who you are either way (to a certain degree of course but it's shocking what families will accept from each other). This results in you (hopefully) feeling the most accepted for your \"true\" (lazy lol) self by them and no one else.\n\nYour child is totally different! They depend on you in a way that a friend or romantic partner does not. You likely feel much more protective of them than a partner or friend yes? There's MUCH more obligation. I don't have a child so I can't speak personally but I would imagine your role in their life is so different that you have wildly different feelings. I mean, of course, a child can be a friend for a small proportion of the time but you don't see your child in the same way as you see your partner do you (ignoring attraction of course)?\n\nI also want to say that up until recently I was also very confused about this. I love very strongly and I feel that love for a number of people in my life at any given time. I love most of my close friends enough I could easily imagine being in a relationship with them. But recently I realized that I was looking for a difference in the way I \\*feel\\* about my long-term partner vs my friends instead of noticing how differently I acted with him, the choices I make. I prioritize his happiness above my own and I don't really do that with friends that often. I spend the emotional energy communicating irritations so we can actually resolve them instead of just kinda putting up with them as I do with my friends. There are other things I can list if this is helpful?",

This is ridiculous. He is putting you completely aside, that is fucking hurtful. I think there is much more to it, that He went this way. I would talk about it. Maybe He is not attracted to you? \n\nSecond: So he is rarely trying to make you happy in bed, but all the stuff you are missing, he is doing to the other girl instantly? \n\nThe threesome is not the problem, your relationship had a lot of them way before!\n\n\nYou need to talk to him about that. He is completely taking you for granted in my opinion. Yeah I understand, it is a new toy thing but if you are not stupid or do care for your loved one, it does not happen like this.\n\n\"Don't have threesomes or it's your fault\" is not the moral of the story. Do not have them, when your relationship and communication sucks. I am talking about him. Obviously he can have passionate sex but did not make the effort for you. There must be more stuff for which reasons he is not investing in you. \nYou instead did not know, you found all of this out in one night, that he is able to have passionate Sex and that he is just not doing that with you. It is not about the Sex but about not putting effort in you and your preferences. You became a duty in my opinion. \n\nThis night has not damaged your relationship, it just showed where you are right now. Threesomes are an extreme situation for a relationship, it works, but only if both parties are honest and communicative.\n\nEdit: Sorry, english is not my first language.",

Maybe OP thought their relationship was slipping, maybe he'd been eyeing other women, maybe OP worried he was losing interest. No matter what, OP wanted to look like the \"cool, spontaneous, fun sexy partner!\" To him, but ONLY with a woman leaving immediately after who she believed she'd never have to compete with... Thats where it gets really messy to me. \n\nOP brought in a woman who, although yes she agreed to this, she was basically just there to be used as a sex pawn just to make OP seem more sexual and empowered to her guy. This is evident by the fact that OP said she chose this chic because she was going to be moving away and they'd never see her again. \n\nOP had no interest in this woman other than her disposability.\n\nOP didn't want a threesome, she just wanted to use 1 person to try and regain some favor/power in her relationship. She had zero chemistry with this woman and wanted to focus on her man and have her man focus on her, but thats not how 3somes work. It obviously failed because she also didn't think enough about the man involved beyond \"He'll appreciate ME SO MUCH for this!\". \n\nOP got her dose of reality when her man focused more on his \"gift\" than his girlfriend during the 3some, which is in no way his fault at this point.\n\nOP didn't just disrespect her man enough to not discuss a 3some prior, she disrespected him so much she purposely set one up for him under the guise of \"a romantic surprise!\" with a woman she also disrespected so much she considered her dust in the wind before the event even started, all just to do what? Give your boyfriend a Valentines Day Gift? \n\nI don't buy it. OP was trying to pull a sneaky sexual power play for some reason. No matter what that reason was, it obviously backfired and OPs out here blaming Henny for her own fuck up.\n\nOr Op posted the FU to try and get sympathy posts that it wasn't her fault.\n\nOr the final twist of drama here would be OP using this all against him, saying that she was \"so open and cool and you just ignored me!\". \n\nThis whole this is baffling and I feel like if OP is desperate enough for a surprise 3some, they're capable of any kind of fuckery.",

My wife of 7 years at the time invited a friend from PA that she had talked to for a few years through role-playing chat rooms over to stay with us for a long weekend. Originally, it was only to see her, but then wifey suggested the threesome unexpectedly. Of course, I said yes, (she was a cute 22 year old, i was 36 at the time) but once the deed was done (3 times over the weekend), the feels were heavy and jealousy loomed its ugly fucking head. The friend and i were very touchy-feely with each other, but i didn't ignore my wife... but the friend did. She completely failed to reciprocate, and that is still something my wife brings up to this day. Mind you, this was before we were polyam, so we didn't have the mental toolkit to properly disect the situation, and she ended up shutting that friend out because she was afraid of us catching feels for each other. (The friend did, I didn't). I found out later that the friend had a boyfriend that she cheated on to be with us, so yeah I'm glad I didn't pursue that lead.",

What are expectations... what are rules of engagement. \n\nSo a guys brain especially on drugs is like a 5 year old you can't really expect much reason. Ok ... so add to that the brainwashing of porn media how awesome threesomes are. They are not, they are messy and will destroy relationships if not planned careful. \n\nSo you take this 5 year old on sugarhigh and give him a new toy that he all a long got lots of commercials for and is really hyped on and expect him to continue playing equal with his old toy (its a metaphor) so of course he will not! And while it was very nice of you to do this for him did you for a second stop to actually think about how it would make you feel ?\nWhat you would be in this or what it would give you?\n\nWell the damage is done. She is moving away yes but have you considered that he might want to stay in contact? He might want to do it again or even fly and visit her In a long distance relationship type.... with or without your consent?\n\nNow it's extra crucial to communicate with him. And for you to sit down and analyse your own feelings. Are you jealous... or envious. Two completely different emotions. What do you expect from him. Is he to cut contact completely because that's what you thought would happen? He is a full human being with desires and wishes. And right now he is very infatuated with this new feelings that he can't figure out himself. Does he still love you? Is he falling in love with someone else?.... non monogami is a real thing but so is being blinded by hot sex into believing its love. \n\nYou two need to sit down and communicate your feelings and needs. Tell him that you did this for him and your feelings are kinda backfiring on you. Many relationships have been broken over stuff like this. And while it was incredibly sweet of you and probably a wet dream of about every male (and some female) redditors you have opened Pandoras box. \n\nFrom it will emerge resentment, confusion, anger and suffering if you do not take it serious. \n\nTldr: Go talk to him about your feelings and work on them together.",

When you surprise your partner and then drink Cognac and smoke directly before the threesome? Prolly not. Excited, faded people aren't known for their great decision making skills, are they?\n\n>After the threesome, you do not continue to flirt with the other person after the fact.\n\nRight. Unless both partners are cool with it, which they could be had they talked about this beforehand. Or not, which OP's dude would know... had they talked about this beforehand.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not tryna say the dude's showing his best behaviour right now, I just don't think you should blame him for that when he's basically been set up to fail by OP from the very beginning. If he's as vanilla as OP claims he is, he might have absolutely zero knowledge on the etiquette around any of this. Hell, if he's particularly naive, he may even think it's okay to keep flirting with the woman because OP literally invited a friend into their bedroom.\n\nAnd I don't even want to get into this whole surprise thing in regards to consent. Oh no, my dude's too vanilla for me, so I'll spring a super non-vanilla experience on him for reasons. Great fucking move.",

Jealousy is problematic in relationships because it stems from a sense of ownership. Another person cannot belong to us, they belong to themselves.\n\nCompersion also sits opposite to envy; when we feel covetous of what someone else has and want it to belong to us, or to be taken from them. \n\nCompersion is related to compassion. When we feel compassion, we identify with and feel sympathy toward another's pain. The word breaks down to literally mean 'to suffer together'. Compersion is sympathetic joy; to indentify with and share in another's happiness.\n\nPeople are most familiar with compersion in filial love. Parents who are happy for their children when they succeed, when they have fun, when they feel good... That's compersion.\n\nSo. It has nothing to do with metas. You can feel totally neutral toward your metas (Yes, YOUR metas. They term is relational; your lover's lovers are your metamours). What matters is that you feel happy for and together with your partner when they feel happy being with their other partners.\n\nSo yes, if you can't feel sympathetic joy for your partner when it's not about you, open relationships are going to be a real fucking struggle.",

Try not to be so gatekeep-y about what these relationships *should be.* You don\u2019t live in a vacuum and everyone\u2019s experience and what works for them is different. Have a great night!",

That's not something I made up, it's just a fact. And again, I'm talking about how you feel about your partner, not the people they're with. Read my previous comment more closely.\n\nAlso, you are misusing and misunderstanding the term metamour. Look up the prefix meta at it applies to this concept. In the same way that metadata is information about information, a metamour is your lover's lover. To them, they are not metamours, but rather paramours (in heirarchical  polyamory anyway). Again it's a relative term.\n\nI don't know what you've learned about polyamory on Reddit, but it's not exactly the end-all-be-all of definitive information. Maybe become curious about learning rather than taking assumptions as fact, because you are misunderstanding both compersion and what a metamour is.",

I love it, but whether it's a one off or something more ongoing you can't just launch in and hope it'll work out. Humans are complicated and messy, and feelings get weird. \n\nTalk to him, be honest about what you found difficult, and figure out between you what you want to happen next. I'm not a big fan of lots of rules, but openness and honesty are a must with this stuff. You can absolutely overcome a fuck up like this, but you both have to be willing to work through it.",

In an ideal situation you'd h ave had that conversation with both of them before she got there and thrown up a no-hard feelings red light to chill the whole activity around that time you said it became \"too much.\"  \n\nThat said, maybe it's as bad as it seems, maybe it's not.   Anything \"new\" is going to be interesting and exciting at first.  Maybe the shine wears off but you are going to need to talk to him sooner rather than later about how you feel and what your concerns are.\n\nI'd suggest an honest, even-tempered mutual conversation.  It was more intense than you expected it to be, it's nobody's fault, everyone was drunk, but where do we stand etc.  The best you can do is let him know that it went further than you thought it would but make sure it's clear you're not blaming him for the situation you created either. This is not a time for dropping hints and signals about how you're feeling.  He needs to understand in clear language that you're uncomfortable and want to make sure it doesn't create a problem.",

      "text": "Honestly this is my take from it. Yes I understand you were trying to be spontaneous and do something nice for him but it's a double edged sword. I'm guessing you've been together for a while now so after some time we all get used to the same routine when you're in it enough. With that in mind, yes is it going to be the best feeling in the world for you seeing him act a different way to someone that isn't you? Of course, but also remember that after a period of time, it's not always that the person is bored with what you both do together, chances are they're accustomed to it and like it but bringing a 3rd party into the mix spices it up and brings out the fantasy they weren't expecting to happen. Which for me as I've been in this situation and being in your S/Os position, did the exact same thing.\n\nIt's different, it's crazy, wild. Not to say that anything you're doing is boring or anything of the nature but it's like trying roleplaying for the first time, you get to be whoever you want. In this case maybe a pornstar with two attractive females. Like I said, it doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong but I would maybe recommend having the conversation beforehand if it makes you feel this way because if he's a decent guy in sure his intentions were not to make you feel the way you're feeling. The excitement of something like this sometimes takes over the thought process of how you're currently feeling.",

Him obviously texting her and trying really badly to hide it is bad, but a strong confrontation about it will clear it up, one way or another.\n\nTl;Dr talk to him not reddit. Like now.",

But ladies, do you understand men? You might think when it comes to sex all men are pigs and getting off on power, domination, and demoralizing sex acts... I can tell you more often, what really does it for a man (emphasis: MAN -- not boy, not guy, MAN) is the love and affection of a woman he can see a future with. \n\nIs your lover picturing Pamela Anderson or Xena Warrior Princess in his head? Do you think guys like hitting and slapping during sex, whether its playful or aggressive? No. At the most basic biological level, the one thing all worthwhile men think about that makes sex great for them -- \"This could be the mother of my child\" and all the qualities he sees in his woman that he wants to pass on to his children.\n\nThat is the most basic subliminal biological turn-on for men, and understanding and addressing that is what will help you mind-fuck your man. A threesome is FUN, thats it. It isn't intimate, it isnt great sex, it is just physical stimulation. Truly great sex comes from the emotional connection that most women don't believe men are capable of, and its probably because most men don't understand that about themselves.",

Anything other than two is a very hard to navigate because everyone should have and get equal attention, but it's so easy to get wrapped up in it and not realize someone is feeling left out.\n\nIt requires a lot of planning, introspection, conversation, and \\*sigh\\* reading in the lead up to ensure everyone is on the same page and understands what will occur and how to make sure everyone gets the attention they deserve. And guess what, even after all that... it's still nearly guaranteed that someone will be left out to some degree that they didn't realize would matter to them going in.\n\nX-somes are complicated. Equal numbers are better because you can pair off and switch now and again.\n\nIt makes my heart swell to see that you were able to communicate this to your partner what you were feeling and they were receptive to that.",

In the poly community, we usually think of it as lasting a month or three then wearing off -- leaving the deeper connections unscathed.\n\nI suggest you talk with your boyfriend; let him know you've noticed, and you're feeling a little odd, but you're trying to vicariously enjoy the emotional charge that he gets out of this new connection. Make yourself a safe place for him to both enjoy himself and retreat to. And have a frank conversation about the rules of engagement before any more encounters!

I've had several threesomes with my partner and  things like this happen. It's not because hes not or less interested in you, but it's because there is something naughty and new in the bedroom. It will always give that spark that you just don't have in your regular relationship. Also, it sounds like you were gifting your girlfriend to him, did you plan on being intimate with her as well, or was it really him in the center of attention? Because in the latter case, you really set him up for quite some performance anxiety. Now your vanilla man has two women to please!\n\nIf you go and sulk and be petty about it, you'll seriously damaged his trust and your relationship. You set up an extra play partner without including him or setting up boundaries and then youre mad because he took the liberties you gave him and he went too far. Instead, when the dust is settled, have a real and open conversation about what just happened, what parts of it you liked, what parts you disliked, how it made you feel and what could have been done to mediate those feelings.

It takes some major trust and massive balls to consent to a threesome when you love your partner, and even moreso to be the one to suggest it.\n\n\u2605This FU is not *entirely* on you. Your man and your friend made bigger FU's than you did.\n\nPlease don't allow this to ruin threesomes for you. You'll be missing out. Your FU was not suggesting the idea, it was only in the execution.\n\n\u2605 Your crucial mistake,\n\nMaking it a surprise instead of planning it. This is fatal unless you're all experienced with threesomes. The threesome would have probably been successful if all three of you met up in person beforehand to discuss/establish all your rules/boundaries to ensure your comfort.\n\n\u2605 Your man and your friend's crucial mistake,\n\nIt's likely that they assumed it would be okay (or even expected) for them to be more into each other than to you because that was their first and last opportunity to have sex with each other. It's a reckless assumption, but it isn't completely absurd.\n\nYour man was VERY wrong to give her a better performance than he did for you. I'm not blaming you for that. I'm betting you were confident he'd figure it out because he's smart about most things and reliable.\n\nBut when trying something sexual that they've never given much thought to before, vanilla people are likely to FU if they wing it. Again I'm not blaming you for being confident in him, and I think he owes you a major apology.\n\n\u2605Mistake that's kind of on all of you, but a *LOT* more on them than on you.\n\nThe part that's on you is that you should never have given him her contact information, or given her his. That's a rule to prevent this shady aftermath you mentioned. This is one case where burning the bridge is appropriate.\n\nThe part that's on them is that the rule I just told you about should *NOT* need to exist. They never would have gotten to have sex with each other if you weren't so awesomely chill and open-minded and eager to please, so as a courtesy to your peace of mind, unless they were already friends before this, they should not be staying in contact with each other.",

              "text": "OK so I can't say this enough but in general, reddit is the WORST place for advice on anything to do with relationships.\n\nThat said, here's some advice from a stranger on reddit!\n\nFirst, you don't really get to be mad at your partner. You surprised this on him without asking or discussing boundaries or anything else. Just \"hey.. fuck my friend\" and then getting upset he didn't know the rules you had in your head is very unfair.\n\nSecond, what *did* you expect exactly? I assume your friend is attractive and was very willing so the guy gets drunk, high, and told *by his partner* that he should fuck her... and he goes ahead and makes the most of it. \n\nThird, people saying \"he's not that into you\" don't know what they're on about. He hasn't sex with anyone else in years and you just put someone in front of him saying \"go for it no strings attached\". So he did. All that means is he enjoyed fucking her, not that he isn't into you. \n\nBasically you need to **sit down with your partner** and talk this out. When you do, keep a few things in mind:\n\n1. Make it clear you aren't mad at *him* because *you* organised this - if you don't I promise you he will get defensive, say it was your idea, and you'll get into a fight. \n2. At the same time, make your feelings clear. Say you know you were behind it happening and that you didn't set the appropriate boundaries, so you accept the fault is on you... but that at the same time you are deeply hurt by his actions during and after. If he gets defensive etc then refer to point #1 and reiterate that you aren't mad at him but it's important you make your feelings heard so the two of you can work through it even if it was your fault. \n3. Say *what* and *why*. Say you were expecting a threesome, not to watch him fuck your friend and ignore you. That you weren't expecting to feel like a third wheel the next morning when it should have been done. That him ignoring you and sticking to his phone afterwards hurts. Again, point out that you know you should have made things clear first and that this is on you but *that doesn't invalidate your feelings*.\n4. Make it very clear that this was a one time sex act and not an opening for him to start something with your friend, physically or emotionally. She's leaving, he needs to let her leave.\n\nNot going to lie, you might have ruined your relationship. But it's quite possible he was just excited because of a guilt free fuck with someone new. It doesn't mean he doesn't want you and is possibly still riding that high.\n\nTalk it through, don't get angry, listen to his side, and make your feelings known. Go from there.",

I never hear of that going well.\n\nI remember in college a guy i knew's gf was trying to force him into a threesome because she is convinced he'll cheat on her if she doesn't let him get a taste of other women. Not only was he not into the idea, the whole reason behind it is fucked and pure shit.\n\nI get you had pure intentions but you should never do something risky without first accepting the worst possible outcome. Only do it if you're okay with that. I've heard so many people say threesomes were either, awkward, boring or relationship ruining.\n\nI've personally never done one, not even close to considering one. It sounds like a bad idea. Plus there's nothing for me to gain there. The only person I wanna sexually pleasure is my girlfriend. Her alone. So bo bueno from me. \n\nI'm sorry this happened to you and hopefully you ditch that dumbass. Atleast there's always a positive to be had. I wish you the best. I apologize if this came off as rude.

Absolutely. But based on her characterisation of him as \"vanilla\", I don't see how he was meant to know what he could and couldn't do in this unfamiliar situation that she put him in, without being told the rules beforehand. This is at least as much on her as it is on him, and you are being very uncharitable towards him by calling him a \"shitty boyfriend\" despite knowing nothing about their relationship beside what OP has told us about this scenario.

I\u2019m curious, lol \ud83d\ude00\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a swinger relationship, an open relationship, or these type of arrangements work out. Never. \n\nI recently ended a 6 month relationship with a married woman that is in an open relationship with her husband. From the beginning I told her I\u2019m a monogamous person, but when I\u2019m single this type is relationship is fine. I also told her I don\u2019t understand how a couple, married or not married, can have an open relationship. I got back together with an ex. I told her I\u2019m a monogamous person, and I can\u2019t have a sexual relationship with her while I\u2019m with my ex. She got mad, told me she was in love with me, told me how hurt she was. I was shocked. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d fall in love with me or things would get serious. I told her sorry, I\u2019m a monogamous person, and I need to see if things will work out with my ex\u2026this ex was the love of my life and I needed to see if things would work out. Again, I don\u2019t understand how people can have open relationships. Never seen them work out. But, to each their own, I guess \ud83d\ude00",

      "text": "As someone who's had a few threesomes. My partner enjoys watching me with other women, but it isn't something that should be a surprise. It can be a scary thing to experience and feel a pressure to perform. You need open dialogue of expectations, what you hope to get from it and what your boundaries are. If she's moving away, the new toy fascination will wear off but it's something that happens. I've been in that place many times, and my partner too. It's normal to feel jealous if your partner clicks with someone. Even in open poly relationships. Just communicate in a healthy what your experience felt like (without targeting anyone else's actions or experience) and what you'll need to feel more secure. Ie. Reassurance, time together, a sex life that is more explorative/kinky. \nIt's also important to remember that the first sex with someone can be kinky, but lots of people plateau and fall into vanilla with ongoing sex with someone (from what I've noticed). Rough and kinky seems to become more difficult to get into when someone begins to be comfortable with someone.\nIt might be worth stating if you don't wish to do it again, as it could also make him feel the dynamic of your relationship has changed to non-monogamy. He may just feel \"she let me have sex with her, so this must be okay\" or not even realise that he's being so fixated on the experience. \n\nNon monogamy requires open, honest and healthy communication. Jealousy is normal. And it should only be a surprise if the couple have done it before and know what dynamic works for them. I doubt this would break your relationship unless you hide your feelings and become resentful. It's also normal for a first time experience to be like that.\n\nHope that makes sense.",

So what would ever make a \"surprise threesome\" sound like a good present for a monogamous, vanilla guy? \n\nAnd then get pissed because they had chemistry. Maybe he felt he had to perform for you and is texting her or a guy friend about how he felt so uncomfortable and pressured that night, which is why he won't show you his phone. \n\nI mean, if a dude and his friend conspired to get a gf relaxed with booze and weed and then suggested a threesome, would you not think that is some shady business? In that scenario, wouldn't the chick feel so manipulated and vulnerable in the aftermath?\n\nSo hell yeah you fucked up. But not because the friend bf might have chemistry. Rather, because you manipulated and planned something without all parties' consent or clear communication about expectations.",

It may very well be that it seemed they were so into it simply because it WAS something/someone new to both of them. \n\nNew experiences are exciting and, especially if he is quite vanilla and hasnt explored his sexuality a ton, it can be very easy to get caught up in the new experience. Sex is so different with every single person, it is likely it\u2019s less about that sex being \u201cbetter\u201d and more about it being new. I get the impression from your story that perhaps the other lady involved was more for your fellow than for you, which can make that harder to have as a shared experience. He absolutely should have taken time to appreciate you, make you feel loved, and included you, but if he\u2019s new to the whole thing it can be extremely difficult to realize that when your dopamine and seratonin is reacting to a new thing and you\u2019re all caught up in the moment (and high and drunk). \n\nMost partners fall into some sort of routine with how they\u2019re intimate. Figuring out and exploring a new person is (often) inherently interesting and exciting. I would personally not feel it\u2019s a sleight on you or your sex life that he got caught up in it, but I do think it could be a really good chance to talk to him about how you felt/what you need to feel loved in those kinds of encounters. \n\nUltimately it sounds like you succeeded in showing him something new that made him happy and may open up new doors for both of you. It feels like the next step is communicating about both what worked and what didn\u2019t, giving him a chance to grow into it with what you tell him, and (hopefully) having awesome experiences going forward where you can both feel loved and taken care of.",

I feel anxious and sad about it, but decide not to press the issue until after we wake up later that day. Talk about how that\u2019s pretty messed up of her (literally attended her cousin\u2019s funeral who died due to a drunk driver a week prior to her bar night with friends... whole other issue there..) anyways i wake up later on and go get her a coffee and some breskfast ,bring it up one more time after we woke up and she tells me she got me a present, I apologize for not doing the same (but I literally just started a new job, she knows I\u2019m on a tight budget for a while etc) she says it\u2019s fine. We spend the rest of sunday hanging out and i played some pc games through the sfternoon and then hung out and watched movies with her and snuggled up. We eventually hit the sack, and go to bed. Wake up monday and head in to work after kissing her goodbye. Later that day she tells me she was up till 5am, is dead ass tired, and is just going to finish chores at her house after work and go to bed.. I don\u2019t think much of it, text and snap her a bit through the day.. cut to today, and she tells me she\u2019s been crying about vday, how i forgot, didn\u2019t do anything special, didn\u2019t make up for it etc.. I didn\u2019t feel like arguing, told her I thought we talked about skipping this one due to schedules, real life etc.. apologized for blowing the holiday off, and haven\u2019t heard from her since noon...\n\nI feel like I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.. i do forget things often, but she knows that about me.. i just don\u2019t store schedules or like to make plans, never have, never will snd she knows that.... however i feel like after attending her cousin\u2019s funeral... her drunk driving to my place after a girls night, not texting or calling me for a ride, and then reversing her agreement not to do a vday thing.. that my fuckup pales im comparison to her recent antics.. \n\nDunno.. just feel irritated and empty about suddenly being the bad guy.. especially after that shit she pulled.",

That way you will all know what the boundaries are, for example: he can't perform anal on her, but he can on you. Arrange a safe word that ALL parties can use if they are feeling uncomfortable, and if it is used, everything immediately stops. Discuss what will happen after the threesome, will the 3rd party stay the rest of the night with you, or will they leave after you are done. Can you both talk about the experience via sms or call with the 3rd, or is it something that's done and you never engage sexually with that person again.\n\nAlso, great advice is hire a sex worker who sees couples. They will have plenty of experience in these situations, you don't need to worry about them falling in love with your SO, they're great at sex, and they're hot! What more could you want?",

I don't mean this in the obvious 'bad' way - it's that the other person is like a shiny new toy. They are bound to be exciting and enticing - especially in the moment. That's part of the fun!\n\nThe thing to understand is that that moment is not going to undermine everything you have together (or at least if it does you have bigger issues than just that moment). With couples that do this successfully either that enjoy seeing the person that love in that moment of ecstatic glee - or perhaps it's a quid pro quo deal whereby they will get a turn to experience the same feelings on a future occasion. Ideally both.\n\nAppreciate this isn't for everyone. But the key thing is not to take that moment as anything more than a superficial high.",

You didn't know the expectations of the chef, just that tonight, two meals were put in front of you and one is new and tasty looking. Can you really be mad at the behavior as the chef because you didn't specify the expectations and didn't understand basic human behavior? I'd say what happened is completely normal from a guys point of view. It's new, it's tasty, it's exotic, it is only going to happen right now and never again. As a guy, our thought process is severely hampered when little head starts taking over. \n\nFor equal play, I would have laid dude down, one rides the D, the other rides his face. Swap occasionally. Everyone gets equal attention, equal pleasure, and no one feels left out. Hope yall can get past this though, but do t blame your man for basic human behavior and especially basic guy behavior when something like this is sprung upon him.
