  "text": "TIFU by not telling my husband that I was pregnant and making him think I was cheating on him.\nHappens to the best of us, eh? \ud83d\ude2d Now that the worst of the panic is over my husband and I are able to laugh about it but, God, that was awful. \n\nMy husband and I generally don't have any trust issues. However, his ex girlfriend cheated on him several times so obviously some scars still carry over towards our marriage. \n\nWe have a (4F) daughter and (1M) son, and we recently found out that I was pregnant. I found out first, I was feeling the nausea HARD and used a pregnancy test that I still had from the box from the last time I thought I was pregnant and, boom, baby in the oven. \n\nI found out on April 2nd and decided to wait until the 25th because that's my husband's birthday and thought it'd be the best birthday gift ever. Pregnancy brain kicked in fast, though, and I carelessly dropped the test in the trash under some toilet paper (I didn't what to touch my pee covered stick more than necessary) while forgetting my husband is the one who takes out the trash. \n\nCome next morning after the trash is taken out, my husband doesn't say anything so I think he didn't notice it. Come the 15th, we're grocery shopping when suddenly my husband starts crying and goes to the bathroom, I didn't want to drag the kids inside the men's bathroom so I call him on the phone and he, still crying, asks if it's his baby. \n\nThis MAN- \n\nI'm not about to have this conversation inside of a Fry's so I manage to get him out of the bathroom, we go outside, I tell him my plan and give him a hug and apologize and he's laughing so hard he can't breath and then tells me to never do that again before he apologized for running to conclusions.\n\nAnd then we went to get frozen yogurt. Food for the soul. \n\nTLDR - didn't tell my husband that I was pregnant, he thinks I'm cheating on him, breaks down in a grocery store, and then we go eat frozen yogurt.",

In the USA, obgyn ask woman what they plan to use as contraception immediately after labor as it is recommended to wait 18 months between pregnancies to avoid preterm labor in the latter. It's good to know during the pregnancy because if they want an IUD, it can be placed right after delivery while the epidural is still active to avoid the undesirable cramping that comes with placement.\n\nIt is a misconception that woman can't get pregnant immediately after birthing. They must be exclusively breastfeeding, and even then it isn't guaranteed. Just reduces odds. If you're curious look up the Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and luteinizing hormones effects on estrogen/progesterone.",

There are a lot of quotable lines/scenes that I still keep seeing on reddit 2 decades later. Twelve seasons should keep you busy for quite some time. After that, quality slowly drops off, you'll have to decide for yourself when to stop watching. To answer your question: yes, I think it's worth your time. I love both the Simpsons and Futurama and to me they are really on the same level quality-wise (Simpsons up to S12). The Simpsons are a lot more episodic, while Futurama has an overarching storyline. However, the Simpsons has killed off a few minor characters permanently. So, it's not entirely back to start at the end of each episode.",

There were many that I didn\u2019t cry at all. It became an expected outcome. My older one has special needs and I really, really can\u2019t handle a second disabled child so if there is something wrong, it\u2019s been a blessing that it was \u201ctaken care of\u201d on its own and I never even had to deal with a termination.\n\nThe only bummer is that my first two are from my first marriage and I\u2019d love to have one with my current partner. So if I\u2019ve felt anything in the several losses I\u2019ve had with him, it\u2019s sadness about that and on his behalf. I once found him crying holding one of our ultrasound photos and that was tough. But IVF with an egg donor is a good option and we will probably go ahead with that in the next couple years.\n\nSorry- that turned into an over share! I am so sorry for your loss. I think it\u2019s a lot harder when you don\u2019t know the reason and have every hope that things will go smoothly. \ud83d\udc97",

The problem is that is *wasn't* detrimental to his health when he first chose to allow her time to surprise him; because at that point in time there was no cause for suspicion; it was a new revelation and the assumption would have been that she would choose to present it at an opportune moment. Robbing her of that would be heartless, and certainly not conductive of a healthy relationship. The problem develops as a function of the time it took for her to reveal the information, which creates a level of doubt; not doubt enough to question her, at first.. but theres no obvious 'threshold' to when that becomes a distinct problem to a persons mental health -- other than when it causes a significant enough reaction. Which it did.\n\n> If that feeling starts to waver, I give them opportunity to explain themselves before thinking ill of them\n\nIf its started to waver, you've thought ill of them already.",

To waver the assumption that someone is acting in good faith is to doubt they are acting in good faith. Thats thinking poorly of them. Your reply here doesn't make sense as being unsure of someones actions or intent is the base state at which we are starting, not a state 'wavered' into.\n\nIf you're choosing not to act, and rely on benefit of the doubt to begin with then you're guilty of the same non-communication that you're criticising OPs partner for; you're just trying to present some very superficial difference between the two as meaningful, when it isn't.",

All the previous stuff on the show was interesting like \"here's a weird natural phenomena that people mistook for a UFO\" and stuff like that. Nothing that would horrify anyone.\n\nThen all of a sudden they pivot from innocent stuff like that to a story of a babysitter getting high, mistaking the baby she was watching for a turkey, and putting the baby in the oven and roasting it alive. Idk maybe the point was that it was an urban legend and it's never actually happened; but I remember me and my mom were horrified by the reenactment section of the story (where they played a baby screaming and wailing as it was roasting alive presumably in agony) and mom shut it off before I ever heard the conclusion.",

You can develop that as a child watching a parent cheat, or a whole range of different things that can happen to lead yourbrain down that path.\n\nTbh mate.. and sorry if it's not my business, but for your partner to act jealous of you when seemingly, neither of you have cheated on each other is a bit of a cheating red flag to me.\nEither she has repressed some shit from her past or something else is seriously wrong there.

We planned on having kids, but not for another year.\n\n\"One year\" set off the alarms in her head, so she decided to go off BC without telling me, thinking we'd have sex for a year and she could get a jump start on it, and when I finally said I was ready after the wedding/school/house buying, we'd have a kid right away.\n\nShe got pregnant the very first time we had sex and finally told me 3 weeks before our wedding after keeping it from me for a month. \n\nNeedless to sat there was a lot of crying over the following weeks.",

Actively trying to have sex during the few days you\u2019re likely to get pregnant each month is different than not actively trying to prevent a pregnancy and having sex when you feel like it.\n\nThink of it this way: if I don\u2019t want to tan in the sun, I wear sunblock. If I want to tan, I go out at the time of day when the sun is at its peak, wearing a bathing suit, and stay in the sunshine (or go to a tanning bed). Going out to run errands in normal clothes without sunscreen isn\u2019t *preventing* sun damage, but it\u2019s also not *trying* to get a tan.\n\n>I know some people do a lot of work to calculate ovulation and all that, but that's mainly for suspected or confirmed infertility issues. \n\nThis also isn\u2019t really true. Most people who are trying to conceive pay attention to their cycle regardless of whether they think they may be infertile. Most women know that they\u2019re most likely to get pregnant around the middle of the cycle (not immediately before, during, or immediate after a period), and if they\u2019re trying to get pregnant, they\u2019d naturally make sure they\u2019re having sex during that time.",

So I'm going to try and respond thoughtfully in the hope that you have an open mind.\n\nI think it's a little bit of a jump on your part to assume anything, given that we don't know each other. As consenting, adults who know the consequences of sex, my wife and i are acutely aware of what can and does happen without protection. It's not guaranteed to happen, but given that we're on our fourth, it's somewhat clear that we would be happy with any result. \n\nI would also be keen on understanding why you think it's irresponsible to have \"unplanned\" children? Has everything in life really boiled down to being on a planning list? Also has everything in your life been according to \"plan\"?\nIt hasn't for me. But God has been very kind regardless and we choose happiness without ever forgetting how blessed we are, even in tough and trying times. \n\nRaising three children is not easy, and with a fourth on the way I'm sure we have our work cut out for us. But, both of us are very excited and happy about it. I'm hopefull that every tough moment will have at least a dozen great moments to make up for it. And that, for us, is the beauty of life.\n\nYou'll notice my world view emerge from my response, hopefully that gives you a little idea of why i don't think it's irresponsible and why my wife and i will sometimes get lost in moments of passion without a care in the world. \n\nHope this helps you understand my POV?\n\nPeace!",

If you have a 4-year-old child together then presumably your relationship has lasted at least 5 years; if he's still so hung up on having been cheated on before that, it might be time to admit that it's impacting his life and he's not going to get over it on his own. I suspect one of the barriers in the way is the idea that therapy is somehow a bad thing, which we as a society have to stop pretending is true.",

If a person's reaction to \"a confusing situation\" isn't \"reach out to my partner and talk about it\" but is instead \"wallow in anxiety and insecurities until I start to make baseless assumptions\", that is a person who needs therapy.\n\nAnd again... that's not a bad thing.

Hear me out: sometimes there is a difference between what you KNOW and what you FEAR.\n\nSome people are afraid of snakes in a cage even though they know they can't hurt them.  They FEEL fear anyway.\n\nYour husband can be totally sure that it's his baby, totally trust you, and yet \"but what if?\" as an intrusive thought might pop up from time to time.  \"But what if?  Nah, that's ridiculous.\"  But the feeling is still there.\n\nI contend that feeling is not there because he has some reason not to trust you, or is an untrusting person.  It's because a woman ALWAYS knows it's her baby and a man can't have that type of certainty.  No matter how much he trusts his wife, he knows that somewhere out there a man trusted his wife just as much and was made a fool of.\n\nI once lost an eyeglass lens on a snow covered mountain.  I knew to a certainty that I would never find it.  But I had to look anyway, though I know it was futile, because I knew that otherwise for the rest of my life my brain would go \"but what if you had just happened to find it?  It's your fault for not even looking!\"\n\nMy *conviction* was that it was definitely lost, but my feeling was \"but there's still chance\" and I didn't AGREE with that feeling at all but it was still there.\n\nMy daughter has my hair, my teeth, my eyesight, her baby pictures look just like me as a baby.  She's obviously mine.  My wife hates infidelity and she also just hates people in general so there's no way in the world that she ever cheated.\n\nBut I still sometimes think it'd be nice to have an objective test that says \"this is definitely your kid.\"  Not because I have any distrust.\n\nDoes this make sense?  My point is that someone who is utterly sure can still have moments where they wonder and then immediately discount the possibility, but it's still unpleasant, and why not for the cost of a test, have an objective piece of evidence to calm down those intrusive thoughts?\n\nIn your husband's case, he's been cheated on before, so he's extra sensitive.  This is not your fault, but you do have the opportunity to do something kind for him.\n\nThere are suspicious, untrusting guys out there demanding tests because they really are jerks that are insulting their wives but suggesting infidelity.  I'm not supporting those guys.  I'm saying it is possible to fully trust your wife but still find a test to be comforting in the face of intrusive thoughts.\n\nYou ever driving and see an oncoming motorcyclist and just think \"with one turn of the steering wheel I could kill someone.\"  You'd never do it in a million years, and you don't think of it because you secretly want to.  It's just something that *could* happen so you think about it.  That's an intrusive thought.  Like being on a roof and thinking \"I could jump off right now.\"\n\nThose kinds of thoughts are not indicative of your true self or anything, so I think if a man has those and would like a test to help alleviate those, it would be a kindness, just like a doctor prescribing prozac might help someone whose brain tends towards depression when they don't choose it to.",

      "text": "If it makes you and your husband feel any better, the first time my wife told me she was pregnant, it took a little while for me to understand/realize it.\n\nMy then-fiancee / now-wife were in a long distance relationship before I moved in with her.  We had just gotten engaged, and a couple weeks later, I get laid off from my job.  I'm taking some enjoyment from it, as it simplified my departure from my company (i.e. since I was laid off, I got back the vacation I was going to spend, I got severance, and I got outplacement assistance, none of which I would have had if I had quit.).  So, I'm sleeping in.\n\nI get a text from my SO at 3am, \"I passed my test!\"  I'm not sure what test this was, she hadn't mentioned one on our previous night's phone call, but ok, good for her, I'm going back to sleep.  A few hours later, not too long before she would be getting our eldest (I acquired him by marriage / relationship, he's not mine biologically, but he's still My Kid, Darn It!) up for school, she calls me.\n\nA welcome (but unusual) wake up call, and we start chatting.  And she's talking about day cares and the like, and I'm thinking \"Ok, that's thinking ahead for the eldest for the summer\", until she said something that was obviously not for our eldest.\n\nAnd it dawned on me that she wasn't talking about our eldest.  \n\n\"Wait a sec, that test you passed.  Was it a pregnancy test?\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n\n\"And it had two lines on it?\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n\n\"Oh.  THAT is why you texted me at 3am.\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n\n\"I'm going to be a daddy.\"\n\n\"Yep!\"\n\n\"We really celebrated our engagement, didn't we.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was quite happy, although a little stunned at the time.  Unfortunately, she miscarried two weeks later, but we still managed to add one boy before our first anniversary, and another one two years later.",

I don't know about you, but I don't think about by birthday all that much. It's not something I would consider as being relevant a month in advance.\n\nThe fact that he waited two weeks shows that he probably initially thought she was keeping it secret for a good reason, if he thought she'd treated right off the bat he would have been more likely to accuse her straight away.",

Just to be doubly clear, this is obviously a fictional account, but it highlights how anxiety can work. \n\nDay one:\n\n> Whoa, is my wife pregnant! That's crazy! Ok, but she didn't tell me after this test, so she must not be ready to tell me. I should let her tell me in her own time. \n\nCouple days later:\n\n> Ok, this is getting a bit weird. Why is she still not telling me? Why would you keep this a secret? She didn't keep babies 1 and 2 a secret. She told me immediately! What's going on this time? Something has to be wrong. But I should trust her and give her time. Maybe there is a good explanation, she'll tell me all about it and well laugh. Don't bug her about these anxieties. \n\nA week later:\n\n> Something is for sure up. No one keeps a pregnancy secrete from their spouse. I hate to think it, but the only other time someone kept a secret from me about sex they were cheating on me. I don't think my wife would cheat though. \n\nA week + a few days later:\n\n> What if she is cheating, and she doesn't know if the baby is mine. She might have gotten a secrete abortion/not know what to do with it! That makes a sickening sort of sense. If she were cheating, having the baby would be a huge risk, as would telling me about it. \n\nTime of breakdown:\n\n> I can't do this any longer, I've waited too long for her to open up with me. I need to confront her. \n\n\nAnxiety and trauma is like a well worn path you walk down naturally. Your brain automatically goes to the worst case scenario because it's been trained to do that. In the case of trauma it's literally experienced the worst case scenario, and the pain that causes 'carves' deep grooves. And keep in mind that the anxiety response makes rational challenges to the fear very hard to carry out.\n\nOn top of that, it's hard, even for someone who doesn't suffer from anxiety, to communicate clearly and directly about such things. It's natural to assume there is some reason it isn't being shared, and/or build up the conversation as a big deal. Lots of people do not have good communication skills. \n\nI hope the husband is getting counseling to help with his anxiety, because there are approaches that can help you break the cycle of rumination and stop jumping to the worst conclusion, but you generally don't get there without work. I also hope that OP, and people reading this, chose to not make major life news \"fun surprises\" as well! I don't fault OP, cause it is a cute idea, but this isn't the first, and it won't be the last time, such a surprise caused serious pain.",
