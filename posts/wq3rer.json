Men aren't paid as much for sexual content because there isn't much of a market for it.\n\nIn the same way, women's sports are less watched and so they are paid less for it. \n\nIt's not by choice, it's because you can't pay someone with money you don't have.",

There are examples of actual 'pay gaps' for both men and women, but it is certainly not a worldwide issue like many make it out to be.\n\nBesides, I am not really sure what your point is. Why would OF cater to men, when that's only 30-40% of their market?  Women make the majority of the money on OF, and that's not even a bad thing, if you take into account the bigger picture.\n\nReducing it down to \"x is paid more than y\" without looking at context just detracts from the issue, and is just a sloppy way of making a point.\n\nWomen are paid more for sexual content, men are paid more for sports. It's an equal market, you just need to know what people will pay you for.\n\nI am simply saying that your point seems to be a pretty weak attempt based on jealousy that women are paid more on OF. As I said, I disagree with its very existence, but you cant really blame them for exploiting a very lucrative market, however exploitative it might be.",

                  "text": "I think Chris should sue her and speak openly about how unfair to men it is when female actresses make more than male actors.  After all, if you include pornography as part of the acting profession, it\u2019s one of the MOST uneven gender gaps of any profession, because women who act get paid MANY TIMES more than men, in MOST cases.  Same with modeling, dancing, massage therapists (a field I am qualified in, by the way), waitressing, and many other professions.  Let\u2019s stop acting like the \u201cwage gap\u201d doesn\u2019t help women in MANY careers.  It\u2019s just not rational to pretend that people will get paid whatever they are paid on the basis of their gender.  People WANT to pay a man for certain things, and they WANT to pay a woman for certain things.  I\u2019ve had to accept this as a massage therapist.  Both women and men prefer a woman to massage them, in MOST cases.  Instead of arguing with the public and acting like they are all sexists, it\u2019s better to accept that people have a RIGHT to pay whomsoever they want to pay, to do what they want them to do.\n\nIf I said that you can\u2019t hire the kid next door to mow your lawn until you got several bids from other kids and then chose the right applicant to mow your lawn by using their gender and racial characteristics to decide who you had to hire, would you think that made sense?  Why can\u2019t you hire whatever kid in the neighborhood you want to, to mow your lawn?  Do you need someone sitting on the sidelines criticizing you for hiring more males than females to mow the lawn?  What if you only had ONE KID ask to mow your lawn?  Do you now have to seek out female children who might want to mow your lawn because they are being underrepresented?\n\nThe whole concept is total bullshit and it never has made any sense.  There is only ONE case where I would say the laws are being violated, and that is when someone is hired at a big corporate job where everyone is somehow supposed to get the same pay, and then some group of people is paid less for some reason.  There has to be at least some general reason for why you thought the pay was meant to be equal in the first place.\n\nWomen often work differently than men.  They are just as capable, in my humble opinion, but they don\u2019t TEND work the same hours, or to work without vacations or sick days.  They often don\u2019t make work their main focus in life.  I have NO PROBLEM with that.  I wish men would learn from it too.  Work is supposed to support the things you want to get out of life, it isn\u2019t supposed to BE your life.  Women can have babies, and men can\u2019t (sorry to say this without showing you my credentials as a \u201cmedical doctor,\u201d but I assure you it is true).  Women have to take time off work to have babies.  I am entirely in favor of them being given the opportunity to take maternity leave, and I also realize there are billions of issues with how maternity leave works at all of the various places that offer it.  It\u2019s genuinely not possible for some workplaces to give women maternity leave, and it kills a lot of small businesses.  I\u2019m also 100% in favor of paternity leave also, to match maternity leave.  The problem is that we have to be realistic that if a business can\u2019t plan for when their employees might just choose to have a 5th or 6th kid, it becomes an expense they can\u2019t be prepared for.\n\nThe only reasonable way to employ people is on the basis of the value they bring to the workplace.  If they allow the workplace to make more money, then they are valuable.  If they go out on maternity leave several times, or even paternity leave, then as much as that \u201cshould be okay,\u201d the word \u201cshould\u201d begs the question of who makes that decision.  Are we complaining to God that there aren\u2019t enough hours in the day?  Are we pretending government is there to solve every family issue we have?  That\u2019s not rational.  If people want to complain about the fact women might be paid a different amount than men, then they have to simply measure that on the basis of not just exact number of minutes worked, but the quality of that work, and it\u2019s relevance to the success of the business.\n\nComing full circle, if Bryce Dallas Howard is such a hot commodity, then why is it that she\u2019s rarely in as many movies as other actors or actresses?  If she brings significant acting talent to the movies she\u2019s in, then how well have those movies done in the box office?!  Chris Pratt has been in 67 films.  Bryce Dallas Howard has been in 43.  Might THAT have a little to do with the disparity in pay?  I mean, she\u2019s only been in 64% as many films (according to IMDB) as an actress.  Maybe she shouldn\u2019t inflate her importance to the movie industry just because she has famous people in her family.  Chris Pratt\u2019s mother worked at Safeway, and his father died young.  He had anything but a Hollywood upbringing.  He\u2019s worked hard for everything he has.\n\nI\u2019ve always been a cinephile and I love rare, artistic movies that most people don\u2019t understand.  I admit that blockbuster action movies haven\u2019t been my thing since CGI made most of them ridiculous and unbelievable.  I hate the movies that many members of the public view audience seem to love.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s not up to me.  The majority rules, and they rule with their monetary choices.  If they are sexist, then tell me exactly how you can make a law that demands everyone stop thinking whatever they think.  Until we have Thought Police, in some nightmarish future, we are never going to see a country where women and men are always treated equally by the public.  We can say it over and over, but until people actually stop treating men and women differently, then the amount they are WORTH to any business is going to be different.  That is the final say.  The final say is in the hands of the PEOPLE, as it always will be.  Instead of pretending we are going to change that, we need to just accept that we need to work with what exists.",

              "text": "Precisely!!!  And MANY female stars get paid significantly more than male stars.  It\u2019s not a great place to complain about women not getting equal pay.  Back when Demi Moore was the hottest thing in Hollywood, she also got paid more than almost any other actor OR actress.  Women in the movies get paid a HUGE amount, but let\u2019s face it:  They also aren\u2019t paid according to gender.  That isn\u2019t the basis of their pay.  They are paid because of how many movies their name sells.  They are paid because the box office gets X number of dollars in the first week when a movie of theirs comes out.  Their pay reflects the REALITY of who people want to see in movies.  It might be racist, sexist, homophobic, or classist, ablist, and anything else you can think of\u2026because it\u2019s based on what the PUBLIC wants.  It\u2019s not even the public of ONE country\u2026It\u2019s the ENTIRE WORLD!!!  If the public isn\u2019t into someone for whatever reason, then they don\u2019t get as much money.\n\nIt\u2019s ludicrous to claim that Bryce Dallas Howard is being paid less than her male costar because she is a woman.  The producers and casting directors and agents would LOVE for her to make more money!!!  They would be happy to pay her more than Chris Pratt if she was actually worth more than Chris Pratt to the movie-going public.  If we want to blame someone, blame the people who buy tickets and choose what movie they would rather see.  Unless you want to force people to sit through every movie Hollywood puts out and then be forced to spend the same amount whether a movie sucks or it doesn\u2019t\u2026whether they hate the main actress or they don\u2019t.\n\nBy the way, non-sequitur, but isn\u2019t Bryce Dallas Howard a serial killer name?  It seems like they are the majority of people who always have to use a middle name.  No one calls her Bryce Howard.  What is the significance of Dallas to her movie business parents, anyway?  Does anyone know?!  I know who her parents are, but I don\u2019t know why they picked the name \u201cDallas.\u201d  Evidently Ms. Howard has to use her middle name because there are just too many Bryce Howards out there!!",

It's like me going to the shops and buying an avocado for $5 then coming back or complaining online that I got ripped off? Why the hell did I buy the avocado? The reason why she accepted the role/pay is because she knows deep down that if she asked for what she 'believed' she was worth, she wouldn't get the role or that pay. I wish I got $500 an hour for my work.. but guess what? I am not WORTH that much to the marketplace. Capitalism does not care for your feelings or beliefs.\n\nSome part of me always thinks what's the end goal of this non-sense? Is it communism or a form of it? For example.. your title will determine your pay. You're a doctor so each and every doctor gets $2000 a week. You're a bricklayer.. each and everyone with that title will get $1000. Somehow determined by how useful/needed that 'title' is to society. So all the experience, work efficiency/proficiency, marketplace... goes OUT THE WINDOW!. Is this really the end game of this? Or less extreme.. they just want women to be paid more/better for lesser/not equal work to appease feminists and in the name of 'equality'.",
