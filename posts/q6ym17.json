I do my part to stop the spread. \n\nThe vaccine doesn't stop the spread because it convinces people that they can go about life normally again and they then spread the virus to each other and point fingers at the unvaccinated. It's another topic of division to demonize another section of society. Just like the elections, just like Blue Lives vs Black Lives, just like etc vs etc.",
