  "text": "TIFU Asking my Tinder date to choke me.\n(This Happened a few weeks back, only posting now since the condition has finally cleared up.)\n\n\nI've just recently started getting back into the dating scene. Met up with a guy from tinder that I'd been chatting with for a few days for drinks. Things were going very well, there were no awkward gaps in conversation, we were both into alot the same things, he was really funny, and it didn't hurt that he was also super fucking hot and in shape.\n\n\nMaybe 2ish hours in he asked me if I had any plans afterwards. When I told him I was probably just gonna go home and watch Kenobi, he asked if I \"wanted someone company\" while I did. I said fuck yeah and we headed back to my place, where needless to say we did not end up watching Kenobi, or at least not very much if it before we dropped the pretense, started mashing lips together, and clothes started flying off.\n\n\nSomething to note about me is that I love roughness and love getting manhandled. I understand that's not for everyone, but that's what I like. This guy was very sweet, and very gentle with me, but at this point I'm very much into it and trying to get him to go harder. Spank me, pull my hair, etc. Finally he's got me prone from behind and I'm calling out for him to choke me, since I know it'll drive me over the edge. He's very reluctant, but eventually relents.\n\n\nI had expected him to just use one hand on my neck, but he ended up using his whole arm, kind of like how they do in ufc fights. It was very tight, but he was putting almost no pressure on it, so I could still breathe relatively normally. I'm not sure if that makes sense, but it's the best way I can think to describe it. Wanting it to be tighter I kind of teased him by saying \"C'mon don't be a pussy\" trying to be sexy but also letting him know to choke me harder. He obliged, and it was the tightest I've ever been choked. I could feel my whole body shaking as I started to orgasm, the next thing I knew I was jolting awake and gasping for air.\n\n\nIt's not the first time I've passed out from being choked, but this guy was urgently trying to get me dressed and to a hospital. I thought he was overreacting until he got me in front of a mirror and I saw that one of my eyes was filled with blood. Like imagine all the parts of your eye that are white are all just blood red. It didn't hurt, but needless to say it freaked me out pretty badly.\n\n\nTo wrap up this overly long story, I spent about 4-5 hours awkwardly explaining what happened to multiple nurses and hospital staff, explaining that I had asked him to do it and that he wasn't abusing me. Which I imagine was hard to believe given the appearance of my eye and the bruise starting to form around my neck. Long story short, the doctor let me know I had popped a blood vessel in my eye, and that while it looked bad, it was most likely superficial and would clear up in a few weeks.\n\n\nHe ended up driving me home, but ended up not responding to any of my calls or texts the following day. Found out he ended up unmatching me on tinder as well. So yeah, pretty sure I traumatized him and blew that opportunity at a relationship.\n\n\nTL;DR: Ended up asking my tinder date to choke me, ended up passing out and popping a blood vessel in my eye, had to explain that I'm just a kinky weirdo to hospital staff, and likely traumatized my date to the point he wants nothing to do with me.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to take a moment to update this post and clear up some things. \n\n1. I completely acknowledge that this situation was 100% my fault and I really do feel awful about what happened, but there's not a whole lot I can do.\n\n2. I had already reached out to try to make amends the day after the incident happened. As much as I would love to properly apologize in person for everything that happened, it's clear that he dosen't want to speak to me, so I'm going to respect his wishes on that.\n\n3. No, I'm not \"going to therapy\" because I have a kink and got caught up in the moment because I was horny, or for any other contrived reason you come up with .\n\n4. Please stop assuming I'm super into BDSM I'm really not. I just enjoy a little roughness and bring choked. I do appreciate the people giving solid advice though.\n\n5. He might have been reluctant to choke me, but he was still very much a willing participant. You can call it victim blaming or whatever, but some of you are very cavalier with your use of the word rape and sexual assault. \n\nWill update if I think of anything else.",

I advise everyone (and I mean everyone) to review [the ACLUs web page detailing your rights](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police#ive-been-pulled-over-by-the-police) depending on the type of interaction you're having with police. Other than states where you're legally required to identify yourself if asked or if it's a traffic stop and you're asked for your license, registration and proof of insurance you don't really have to say anything. You are not obligated to explain what you're doing, where you're going, why you're doing it, how fast you're doing it, how you know (or don't k ow) the person standing next to you, etc. \n\nIt's important to note that if you wish to exercise your legal right to remain silent you should invoke that right and not simply remain silent.",

He claimed they had consenual sex, he choked her for rough sex, thought she passed out, but she died. He freaked, buried her on some guys property, took her car back to the city and ditched it yada yada yada eventually got caught and convicted of murder. He also kinda looked a lot like Johnny Depp.     \nWhen she was missing my buddy was CERTAIN it was going to turn out to be a Big Lebowski situation. But sadly it was not.",

Simple as that. Keep your little hissy fit up though, it amuses me. What make you think you can discount other people's fear, experiences, and observations on the risks in dating?

OP should probably spend some time there just reading and working out the safest way to explore this particular kink. For me it's fairly light vessel compression, nothing on the airway at all and only for short periods. It works for her as I can hold her throat without compressing and generate the dom vibe and then only compress the arteries and then only enough to feel which is still a risk. Stay the hell away from desaturating a human though, also don't fully compress the vessels as you can throw a clot without too much effort. Seriously OP read some of the choking threads they are very informative as to risk.",

I'm not as experienced, I just know enough to know not to crunch someone's trachea and not to hold a blood choke for too long. :)\n\nP.S.

However it seems like he gunned the choke super hard which is why that blood vessel popped. She definitely needs to talk to her partners beforehand because even though this guy did the right choke, he probably went from relaxed to trying to put her to sleep in a heartbeat, and that change in pressure is always gonna be rough.",

The last thing the typical dude wants is a fucking assault charge when it was not assault, and there ARE women out there spiteful and vindictive enough to make false allegations.\n\n\nWhen it comes to kink, safety and consent is a PRIORITY, as are safe words. \n\n@OP before you EVER engage in even light kink, you NEED to talk to the other person about it first so they know what you like, can discuss any concerns, and figure out a safe word. This is for BOTH of your safety. Especially if you like to be choked. People literally have died from erotic asphyxiation so it's not some light thing to toss around mid-fuck with a guy you just met, especially if they evidently don't have experience with it.\n\n\n\nThis was exceptionally reckless and whole I presume the OP learned a valuable lesson, to anyone else reading this, please don't be this fucking stupid.

          "text": "Seriously. My gosh. I\u2019m a very sex positive person and also very passionate about sex education (not just in school but as a lifelong thing). And my gosh, seriously please. Regardless of orientation or age or gender (I certainly admit that as a lesbian my head wouldn\u2019t probably jump as fast to worrying about legal stuff but I totally understand how a hetero dude would) freaking don\u2019t do this kind of thing with someone you\u2019ve just met. Choking isn\u2019t just \u201crough sex\u201d, it\u2019s risky sex and something you ABSOLUTELY want to communicate about and discuss in advance. And to educate yourself and your partner/s on. Frankly even then many sex educators and sex therapists still don\u2019t recommend it. Because while you can dramatically decrease the risks, there will always be some not insignificant risks involved. \n\nBut holy shit, asking, or downright pleading as OP did, in the middle of sex, with a partner you\u2019ve literally just met. That\u2019s outrageously risky and I honestly think it was a little bit shitty that OP really pushed this guy beyond his comfort zone. I have never in my life been the type to pull this kind of line but legitimately, can you imagine this situation if the genders were swapped? Most people would be calling it assault. And I don\u2019t mean because they had rough sex or because of how the choking end, but because it seems relatively clear she pushed the guy beyond what he was comfortable with, experienced with, or likely ever wanted to do (and frankly OP, given how it ended, even if he hadn\u2019t unmatched and basically blocked you- which truly, good on him- your likelihood of getting him to have this kind of sex with you again is so much lower than if you had just had a freaking conversation in advance or  taken his considerable \u201creluctance\u201d for the no it was. I\u2019m not trying to shame you but woah, that\u2019s not ok behavior. Doesn\u2019t matter what YOU want or even that you\u2019re female and he\u2019s male. No, I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t want to, any sort of reluctance is a freaking NO. Especially in the middle of sex, especially with someone you haven\u2019t even had basic communication about sex and likes and dislikes with and have just met. That\u2019s coercive as fuck.)\n\nHave all the rough sex you want. That\u2019s great if that\u2019s what you\u2019re into. But frankly whether you\u2019re into the kinkiest stuff or the most vanilla sex on earth- communicate. Ideally BEFORE anyone gets naked or things get hot and heavy. And RESPECT YOUR PARTNER. Even, and especially if, it\u2019s your first or even only time (like even if it\u2019s clear up front you\u2019re both just looking for a one time casual hookup). And for the love of G-d, if you\u2019re into more risky behaviors like choking, you don\u2019t spring that shit on someone in the middle of things. Have some respect for your partner AND *yourself* and play safe, make sure they know what they\u2019re doing and that you are both as educated as possible about the safest ways to participate in that behavior. As a general rule, even with communication, I\u2019d probably have a hard line about not doing that kind of thing, whether I was looking to give or receive the choking, for a different day than the day I first brought it up (me, I\u2019d never go that far with someone the first time we had sex because there needs to be trust there and a greater level of it than for having sex in general, but certainly to each their own on the specifics. Still to each their own and their partner\u2019s own as well.) Again. This kind of thing ABSOLUTELY needs to be discussed in advance. And studied so it\u2019s done in the safest way possible, with both participants fully understanding this is a risky act. That\u2019s not something that\u2019s likely to be achieved the same day as the conversation around it comes up. And for the love of G-d, you need to have a conversation. Especially around risky behaviors. \n\nOof. I got a bit more heated than I realized I was because the more I thought this through the more frustrated I felt. And damn, while it is certainly a realistic fear that she could\u2019ve turned around and sought charges against him, arguably if our society and justice system were better- he has ever right and might\u2019ve wanted to consider charges against her. He was coerced into doing things he didn\u2019t really want to do or have the full understanding on how to even perform safely, and he got a mighty traumatic experience out of it. This is one hell of a fuck up and I\u2019m not sure the OP even realizes that or just where her \u201cfuck up\u201d lies in this. She had such shocking little respect for both herself but especially for her partner. I don\u2019t even care anymore if this sounds harsh. Because it\u2019s really not about OP being \u201ckinky\u201d or having to share that with medical staff.",

You can be dead in a minute.\n\nTo put this into perspective, over here in Europe, for a while it was in for school kids to strangle each other until passing out, just as a dare game.

Like this isn\u2019t just common knowledge we\u2019re all ignoring for the sake of conversation. Your heart races because it\u2019s trying to pump blood to your brain (as it should be getting there) and the resultant release and wave of oxygen increases the high. \n\nNow while I don\u2019t doubt many, many people enjoy this in a controlled environment; but to try and tell anyone with a basic understanding of human biology that it\u2019s not risky is\u2026frankly stupid. \n\nThe closest analogy I have within my own circles of interest is fire breathing. Looks amazing, it\u2019s done regularly and as safe as possible, but it\u2019s dangerous. I know people who have permanent lung damage from the wind changing just at the wrong split second or they didn\u2019t stop fully exhaling. There\u2019s a terrifying story of someone who basically ignited their lungs with backdraft that I would urge anyone with an interest in starting it to read, because it\u2019s important to know the risks of what you are doing. \n\nCarry on with whatever interests you by all means. But saying breath play isn\u2019t risky is like saying skydiving is safe. It\u2019s as safe as you can make something if done correctly, but that doesn\u2019t take away the amount of risk.",

But calling someone over dramatic for recognising a very real risk is you completely disregarding how dangerous something is. That's either due to ignorance, in that you just dont understand the biology of why it works, or a level of personal bias 'nothing bad ever happened to me so its not dangerous'...both of which are equally stupid when actually discussing something dangerous. The aforementioned skydivers sometimes have 1000's of hours experience with jumps; it doesnt make it any less dangerous when they jump out of a plane. They're still dead until the chute opens. if someone ever passes out from lack of oxygen...they need medical assessment, as at that point its a fine line between all good and damage caused.",

We'd been talking/sexting for about a week, she had told me that she likes it really rough. \n\nI'm no stranger to bdsm and rough play (all consensual and discussed beforehand) and was 100% cool with everything that she had brought up. Nothing too crazy, just chocking, slapping, hair pulling, some degrading talk, possibly some rope play, stuff like that. \n\nWe meet up at the bar, things are going *ok*. She's really into astrology, which I find cringy af, but I can live with that. She's also talking about crystals and energies, and all of that dumb new age stuff, but hey, she's hot, she's horny, and she's kinky, I can deal with the rest. \n\nUntil she asks me how I feel about knife play. \n\nI was like... \"Knife play?...what *exactly* do you mean?\" \n\n\"Oh, you know, nothing too crazy, like no cutting or anything, just you know, would you be comfortable holding a knife to my throat when you're fucking me?\" \n\n*Awkwardly laughs* \"no, no, I dont think I'd be into that.\"\n\nWe talked about it for abit, why she was into it, why shed trust a stranger with her life, what if an accident happens, etc. \n\nNeedless to say, I drove her home, dropped her off, and left. \n\nNot the craziest story from my tinder days, but definitely top 5 material.\n\nEdit: my date with a cat serial killer detailed below.",

Super talkative, talking very fast, lots of blinking, *very* into the convo. Definitely wasn't on drugs, but she was going at 100. \n\nI'm thinking \"alright, I mean, kinda weird, but this could be fun\". \n\nWe continue talking, she (of course) brings up her kinks and they're pretty standard, especially for a first date reveal. The only one that stood out was \"sensory deprivation\", to which I politely inquired more about. \n\nBlindfolds, pillows over heads, noise cancelling headphones, etc. \n\nI said that I'd be fine with that, as long as she's comfortable and wants it. Not normally my thing, but I'm open to try new things. \n\nWe start talking about her thesis, which seems pretty interesting. \n\nShe's doing research on a disease which causes blindness and deafness in humans and can spontaneously manifest at random stages in someone's life (or something like that). It was super niche and not a very prevalent disorder, but that's kinda the nature of PhD work. \n\nI ask her if her sensory deprivation kink has anything to do with the research, and what came first, the kink or the thesis. \n\nThe thesis came first. \n\nCool. \n\nNow, I ask her more about her research, since I'm a scientist, myself and am interested. \n\nTurns out that her research is *very* hands on. She actually dissects and studies brains with this disorder. \n\n\"Cool! Wait... What? You dissect human brains? How do you get them?\" \n\n\"Oh no, not humans, cats!\" \n\n\"Uhhhh how do you get the cat brains?\" \n\nTurns out that cats are one of the only other species that have this disease and it's a lot more prevalent, so what was happening was that when a vet would identify a cat that had this disease, they would contact the university (who had requested as much) and ship the cat to the university. \n\nFrom there, my date would euthanize the cats, cut them open, and study their brains. \n\nWe wrapped up our date, I drove her home, wishes her well, and went and jerked off in my hotel room.",

It's also pretty unpleasant even when it doesn't result in injury, as it usually leads to a hell of a headache.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe term rear naked choke can be applied to holds that do any of the 3.

In my experience, larger men are assumed to be gentle giants, and if this is true, it's because society conditions large men to be docile and jovial.  And conversely,  short men don't get as much of that conditioning and, perhaps, are more aggressive (the so-called Napoleon complex).  \n\nBut to answer the side note directly, I honestly think it's not about attitude but merely physical capability.  If you are 6'1'' and 275, and you're dating (let's say) someone who is 5'0'' and 100 pounds, you can toss her around with little effort, and a lot of women love that sort of thing.  If you're 5'6'' and 150 pounds, and your partner is 5'11'' and 160, it's going to be a lot harder.  Even if you're really fit and strong, the fact of your partner being taller/longer is going to make it awkward.  I dated a girl who was 5'9'' and 140, when I was 6'0'' and 180.  She loved to be handled roughly, and I was strong enough to do it, but I sure could have used another 3 inches of height to make it easy.",

Systematic oppression is related, in that it creates rape culture, but is not rape itself.\n\nYou are a bad person for invalidating the experiences of many people who have been raped. You are a bad person for spreading this horrible perspective.\n\nYou need to take a long minute and assess how you perceive rape.",

People mostly think of toxic masculinity as just whenever guys are assholes (which it can be part of that) but it's also stuff like this or telling guys not to show their feelings or any number of cultural beliefs that force guys to conform to the \"masculine\" stereotype.\n\nIf a woman is pressured into sex we don't say \"well she could have just kept saying no\" but in this case a guy is pressured into doing something extremely dangerous but much of society thinks that since he is a guy and the woman didn't physically force him to do it then it's not the same thing as forcing a woman into sex. \n\nAll around shitty for everyone and a great example on how toxic masculinity ends up hurting everyone in the end.",

My opinion is that the last few years have brought a lot of attention to consent, nuances and sex education, but the discussion is still gendered. It kind of needs to be, the playing field is nowhere near equal. \n\nHowever, it has also become a little skewed, it seems like we forgot about the instances where men can be victims too and treat them as if their problems are not as important, simply because they belong to the oppressor group (using terms proposed by post-modernism), ie men. \n\nMen can be sexual assault victims too, men can be pressured into sex and doing things they are uncomfortable with, men can be raped. Consent applies to men just as it applies to women. Yet we laugh about it or act as if it isn't a big deal, sometimes even going as far as denying that it happened (such as \"how can it be rape if you got hard\", even though arousal non-concordance can happen to anyone), whereas if the roles were reversed very few would find it funny. OPs story is great example, they wrote it as if it was a funny oopsie. It is anything but. \n\nIt is unfortunate because bringing this issue up usually makes one seem like a male apologist and believe me, I know the world isn't equal even though I'm lucky enough to have been born in a very equal country (Sweden). It is nevertheless an issue, and a complex non-linear one at that, that needs to be discussed. There are a lot of double standards with these kinds of topics, which leads people to frustratedly say things like \"if the roles were reversed ...\", or the much harsher \"consent doesn't exist for women\". I hope we'll talk about this from the perspective of the victims as individuals rather than men or women sooner than later.",

Even when you're around people that know what they're doing and have experience, you can't predict when you suddenly go out like a light bulb and need help. Let alone doing something like this with someone you just met a few hours ago.\n\nI'm not shaming anyone here, I get it's fun to do and exciting. But I also know of a couple of breathplay expects that had died of suffocation because of little mistakes they made, or worst they played alone.\n\nWhen I was younger, I bought a bondage sleep sack with a breathing tube through the hood. Covers your whole body from top to bottom. \n\nThe sack takes some time to get into (and out of) and restricts your arms to the side of your body. I played solo with it, with no one around.\n\nThe tube, which was long on the outside of my hood, but very short inside, popped out of my mouth while I was struggling against it. And it was pulled a far distance away from my mouth. The fear that set in, is unlike anything I have felt since.\n\nI couldn't move, I couldn't reach it, I couldn't breath. The latex sealed over my lips. And for 20+ seconds, I thought I was going to die. \n\nWhether through luck or fucking divine interaction, I was able to get the breathing tube back in by moving my chin around and stretched the latex back away and the tube popped back in.\n\nLearned my fucking lesson. \n\nI still love to do it, but now I make sure I have a partner around or at least my hands free.\n\nI know it may seem unsexy or ruins the \"fun\" a little, but taking it slow, learning the dangers, and having a plan with someone, is far better than dying and/or having your partner go to jail for manslaughter.",

It concerns me when so many young people I know are into choking, but also don't know the basics of first aid in the slightest. Or when others I know are totally into being tied up and restrained but don't have a set of safety shears. I know from experience that having a set of safeties around like I was taught is super important because it's actually surprisingly easy to dislocate something, or for someone to panic and suddenly struggle to breathe. Choking is great fun, as long as you're safe with it, but what if the person you're with isn't, or doesn't know how to be. Crushing a larynx takes a shockingly small amount of force, and unless you have something to maintain an airway on hand that's probably going to kill you.\n\nI feel really old man shakes hand at sky when I talk about this, but being in the military previously and hearing stories from like 18 year olds of either gender and then questioning some stuff makes me a little scared for the next generation of kinksters.",

Passing out from lack of oxygen to your lungs is much worse. Blood chokes compress the carotid arteries which causes your brain to shut down. It's something that happens in Jiu Jitsu training frequently and while you try to avoid it, there's no known permanent damage that comes from passing out this way. The dangerous part is having someone untrained applying it. When you're being choked like this there's a spectrum of being close to out or completely out and it can be hard to tell if you're hurting someone without training. If they end up applying it for a couple of minutes while you're out it can do some brain damage.",

I slapped her harder than either of us expected and accidentally knocked out one of her back molars. She had two that were implants from a skating accident she had as a kid, so they pop out easier than an actual tooth would with a lot less pain. It was definitely a mood killer at the time, and I felt absolutely terrible when it happened, but now it's just a zany story from my tales-of-my-ongoing-youth. \n\nSometimes you get caught up in the moment and accidents happen.

Understand the pressures and real fear men feel under at all times, and the blanket suspicion and apathy that follows them for most of their lives. No one's sexual fantasies are worth the other's mental breakdown, anxiety, or trauma regardless of gender. \n\nEven your reply about you not wanting to get yourself caught up in the moment again is pretty selfish. This whole thing was never about your moment or kink, it was about what you did by pressuring a man to do something he didn't like. If it was the other way around with a man pressuring a woman into doing something she didn't like there would be some people pushing that what you did was non consensual sexual abuse.

Man-shaming (or any gender based shaming) is abhorrent, and unfortunately we live in a society where men who are victims of this common sexual and psychological abuse from female assailants are laughed at, belittled, \"emasculated\", and driven to self-harm, substance abuse, and suicide. This is a global phenomenon. I'm in Asia and it's the same here. There are no laws in this country to protect men from abuse and sexual exploitation, in fact only women and children can be sexually and psychologically abused under the law here. A result of social-justice not seeking redress and balance, but petty revenge. All the while there are people being sexually and psychologically abused without consent for sexual pleasure and gratification without the empathy and protection of the state and society they live in. No doubt this is the case in the country OP, and her victim, are from. \n\nFor context I was a child victim of forced sexual abuse and exploitation by a female teenager of legally accountable age. I've had my abuse largely ignored and hushed, and I've read and heard from other men of similar treatment. I have a feeling there are a lot more of us who aren't able to speak out.

The killer is still held legally accountable for murder even if \u201cs/he was asking for it\u201d.  \n\nThere\u2019s a debate to be had over medical euthanasia for late stage terminal cancer patients. But people who are just like \u201cI\u2019d find it really hot if you killed me\u201d? No. If you kill someone in that scenario you\u2019re a shitty person and should be held legally accountable.  \n\nAlso, killing someone is still wrong even if it\u2019s on accident/unintentional. IE Manslaughter. People don\u2019t just drop dead, you have to be doing some irresponsible shit (like driving drunk or engaging in fetishes that lead to death).   \n\nThere is no legal or moral ground here and it\u2019s disgusting Reddit is actually siding with the guy. He always had the choice to leave which is what any decent person would have done, but he was thinking with his dick and thought \u201cyeah it\u2019s worth running the risk of killing this chick if I can get laid tonight, hey *she\u2019s asking for it*\u201d and went through with it. \n\nIt\u2019s basically taking advantage of a person with mental illness",

If this story had been written from a male perspective you'd definitely be under much harsher scrutiny.\n  \n  \nEdit in response to your edit - you pressured someone into a sex act they were not comfortable with. That is 100% sexual assault. You can call him a willing participant all you like but many people have been raped after saying yes. A yes is only a yes until it becomes a no, and it's common knowledge that showing reluctance is a derivation of no when it comes to sexual consent. Suggestions of therapy are sensible, not for your sexual preferences but for the fact that you seem fully comfortable with all of the above and your participation in such.",

The OP described a blood choke.  Blood chokes done from one person to another, do not kill, unless the person choking the other person is killing them intentionally.  It takes more than FOUR minutes of holding the choke (if it's a blood choke) before any brain damage starts.  People pass out due to the carotid sinus and vagus nerves being compressed and stimulated and that drops blood pressure and lowers heart rate. Source:  I've been choking people for 27 years.",

There are more often than not cases of cops accidentally choking people to death specifically because they don't know what they're doing.\n\n\"Against a resisting opponent, sometimes the blade of the forearm created by the ulna bone is used to apply direct pressure to the trachea.

OP was a blood choke as evident by the fact that she said she can still breath despite being choked.  Blood chokes are like what is used in MMA and other combat sports. It temporarily slows blood flow to the brain (but due to arteries in the spine, and that carotid arteries are on both sides of the neck) blood flow is never stopped entirely. It can cause a person to pass out if held too long but as soon as the person choking lets go full blood flow returns to the brain. Oxygen chokes are more dangerous because unlike blood vessels the trachea isnt squishy. It can be damaged by the choking. In addition a person being air choked doesnt lose consciousness until their blood oxygen level falls drastically which can VERY rapidly permanently damage the brain, and the person may not start breathing again on their own.",

      "text": "Ok, what you are into is considered extreme edge play in the BDSM world.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t even fit into the Safe, Sane and Consensual (SSC) ethos, it\u2019s outright in the Risk Aware Consensual Kink (category).\n\nRACK Players don\u2019t want their activities legalised.  RACK playing relies on both participants researching human anatomy way beyond the normal person.  \n\nRACK playing requires a submissive or masochist to accept that there is a small but real risk they\u2019ll die during a play session.\n\nIn return, the dominant or sadist accepts there\u2019s a small but real risk they\u2019ll kill their partner and go to prison for manslaughter.\n\nWe don\u2019t want our consensual activities to be legalised, because every one of them would be horrific forms of abuse without consent, and we want no where for domestic abusers or sexual predators to hide.\n\nRACK playing requires establishing a relationship of deep trust, and communication and relationship skills way above average, even if you only ever play with each other once, for purely sexual or kink purposes.  If a masochist is going to trust a sadist to stick to the agreed rules and to stop when they want them to stop; to not turn kink into abuse or rape, the sadist also needs to make sure the masochist was not left with hard feelings, or feeling abused or raped and going to the police with their cuts or bruises.\n\nA lot of predators hide in the BDSM community.  There are safety precautions (involving a trusted friend calling you during the date with prepared code words, you calling your trusted friend once you are safe back home afterwards) that masochists take on a first date that you didn\u2019t take.\n\nAny activity that creates bruises; cutting/knife play, burning/fireplay, skewering/needle play and any form of choking is categorised as RACK.  (Bruising goes into RACK because far too many people don\u2019t realise it substantially increases your chances of a blood clot detaching and travelling to your heart, lungs or brain and killing you)\n\nEven though rope play (tying someone to a bed up to elaborate shibari) is generally seen as SSC, you actually need to *research* to make it Safe.  If you do it wrong\u2026 and even if you do it right, the person who is bound may get permanent nerve damage, including permanent tingling or pain in a limb.\n\nIf you do shibari wrong, you can easily cut off blood flow to a limb for over half an hour. You need to research/learn attend a class to know what a tied limb with and without blood looks like.\n\nThe choking in otherwise Vanilla porn is *fiction*.  \n\nAsking someone who doesn\u2019t know about RACK to choke you is pretty much abuse: you were flirting with sending him to prison and you didn\u2019t even seem to know that or have thought that through.\n\nIf you ever want to be choked during sex again, please never do it without exchanging Soft and Hard Limits with your partner.  *ASK* your partner before sex if they are into SSC or RACK.  If you can\u2019t do that before sex, choking needs to be 100% off the menu.\n\nPlease go to r/BDSM advice for some good books for beginner kinksters, or websites with great anatomical information about choking and how to reduce the risks of brain damage or death.",

BIG TIME.                \n\nI get that you like it rough a lot of people do, nothing to be ashamed of there.               \n\nI adhere to the safe, sane and consensual way of things.               \nEven if I was following consensual non-consent I still wouldn\u2019t have engaged in CNC or rough sex or any form of bondage, spanking, hair pulling etc and for 100% definitely NOT breath play with a person I just met let alone when if we were both or one of us drunk.                         \n\nYou have a very real responsibility here for the trauma you inflicted. My interpretation of your post is you\u2019ve dismissed it.                 \nI\u2019m using kink/s as a generic term to save me typing.        \n\n* Firstly he was drunk, from what you describe not black out drunk but under the influence of alcohol, absolutely unacceptable to engage him in kinks when you know he can\u2019t honestly, openly, with a sober mind and without pressure consent!        \n* he was completely inexperienced!              \n* Let\u2019s say he was sober, your introduction to kink was harmful and traumatic. Most men are taught their entire lives NOT to put their hands on another person in a violent manner especially women.                   \n* he was in the middle of sex, drunk and you pressured him to perform acts he clearly wasn\u2019t comfortable with. Aka assault or coercion.          \n* on the most basic levels you didn\u2019t respect him as a person. You saw him as a prop. Yes one night stands are fun, if both people are consenting to ALL activities and are getting out of it what they want/need/desire.                                \n* you used derogatory language and insults to get him to do what you want. Can you not see how wrong that is?                  \n* You didn\u2019t know each other! Consider your safety, you got very lucky that he was a nice, decent person and treated you with respect. He stayed to make sure you woke up.            \n* exploring kinks is a process, it involves sober discussion prior to doing anything. Everyone is allowed to opt out, have hard boundaries, say yes and then say no if they don\u2019t like it, etc etc.           \n* You flippantly make reference to blacking out and coming too previously. Do you know the physical damage done to yourself and what to avoid to make sure you do wake up? What if you hadn\u2019t? Or lack of oxygen to the brain caused a stroke or similar?                    \n\nKinks are fun and very enjoyable. You seem to have missed the part about consent and respect.                   \n\nI encourage you to learn more, maybe go to a registered event or similar (aka not a tinder hook up or random meeting in a hotel) to explore the finer points, read up there\u2019s plenty online and in Reddit.                \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to like rough sex and kinks it\u2019s another thing completely to traumatised people.",

She said yeah, but then started to cry. So I stopped everything, told her how very sorry I was for such a silly mistake, you should ALWAYS check in with people before on this stuff you never know what traumas they might have. I got dressed at her request and left.\n\nAnd that kids is how I got a gal pursuing me at 100 miles an hour to do a complete uno reversal in about ten seconds. She broke it off the next day.",

Even if he didn\u2019t get convicted he\u2019d have to go to trial and spend his life savings on defense and it would still ruin his life. For all he knows you could have had a hidden camera in your place and your could be planning to edit the footage out of context and either blackmail him with it or just plain end his life with it. \n\nOr the hospital staff could think that you\u2019re covering for him and report him anyway, and detectives could be investigating him without contacting you if they think an interview with you would be exculpatory. It\u2019s a loophole where if they say they were unable to contact the victim, then they don\u2019t have to disclose anything and they can trap him into incriminating himself.  Chances are he lawyered up and they told him to have no further contact.  Lawyer probably told him don\u2019t speak to anyone about it, just lock himself in a room and hope for the best. \n\nNot your fault, but in the present legal situation innocent men have reason to be afraid. I haven\u2019t been in this situation, but I\u2019ve had women on dates play the hot-and-cold game with me after inviting me back to their place and that is a dead stop for me.

It could have been 2 seconds or a minute, but I bet you each one of those seconds felt like an eternity to him.

Getting side eyed by nurses and doctors, having his image and reputation be called into question likely forever now by that group of people as they stare at him to determine if he\u2019s an abuser, his innocence not even really being believed after your most adamant declarations of the truth. All it would\u2019ve taken for him to end up in jail/prison, would\u2019ve been you simply not waking back up, or the nurses deciding you weren\u2019t telling the truth and involving the police. Think about how many times it went through his head: \u201cI could\u2019ve killed her. What have I done?\u201d\n\nThink about how betrayed he must\u2019ve felt by you. \n\nPeople are being harsh on you because you\u2019re being extremely cavalier about what could have been (and truthfully still might be) a cataclysmic event in both of your lives. If nothing else, you need to put in writing everything that happened, how it is *entirely your fault*, and truly apologize. Not just for scaring him, but for violating his boundaries. For implicating him in what easily could have been your death. For having his character questioned in that hospital. For not respecting him, and thus putting him through what may have been one of the most traumatic moments in his entire life. For being selfish and thoughtless. For ruining rough sex for him for probably a long time. Affirm his character. Proclaim that he *is* kind, and good hearted and caring and all the things you\u2019ve now made him question about himself. Do right by him, even if he doesn\u2019t respond. \n\nSo, get a clue and get one fast before you die and ruin another innocent person\u2019s life.",

Choking that causes someone to pass out is especially bad, such as if you fall and whack your head on something, or you vomit and aspirate because the person doesn't know what to do. Of course, you can also choke for too long.   \n\n\nNot trying to scare anyone out of being into this kind of kink.

Maybe I'm not up to date on current practices but a big red flag on the understanding front was when OP said they could still breathe fine. When being choked correctly in a sexual context (to my understanding) cutting off the air supply is not the target. Little to bo pressure should ever make its way to the windpipe. Restrict blood flow to the brain (*not* cut off) by putting pressure on the carotid artery.\n\nAnd even then *crazy* dangerous if it involves people who don't know each other at all and still regular dangerous with long term folks.",

      "text": "Strangulation is really quite dangerous. It is dangerous in 2 different ways, airway occlusion and blood vessel occlusion. What I mean is, sure you can BREATHE. But the reason you passed out is because the vessels bringing oxygenated blood to your brain were smushed. And your brain wasn\u2019t getting oxygen. AND/OR the vessels bringing old/deoxygenated blood OUT of your brain were smushed and there was an \u201cover-pressure\u201d situation created in your brain, which then causes lack of oxygen to your brain, which caused you to pass out. You already have 2 key symptoms we assess for during a strangulation assessment: passing out and burst blood vessel. You can even have no outward injury and have life altering injury or die of a strangulation injury up to 1 year later. Stroke or dissection. Hey, I\u2019m glad you got medical treatment. It doesn\u2019t take much to fucking kill someone by strangulation, even by accident. Source: am SANE nurse with strangulation assessment education and experience. \n\nSorry to be a bummer but strangulation is serious.",

I have fibromyalgia so really anything gets me sore and tired. My hands are always tired and that definitely affects my grip.  So I just pushed on her throat with a fist but apparently that was 2 hard. She also wanted me to fist her. It was weird.  She was kinda nuts. She thought I was rude for being a little late to a reservation. The restaurant we went to, I realized when we got there, I didn\u2019t need a reservation it wasn\u2019t busy at all. It was raining that night so grabbed an umbrella and put it under the table when we ate.  After dinner started to walk out when I remembered the umbrella so went inside and kinda had to duck under the table to get it. Later that night date was in a weird mood and said she thought I was rude for the way I retrieved the umbrella. I still don\u2019t understand why it was such an issue for her.  Went home after that and she stopped replying for a while. Then a few months later she tells me she\u2019s in the uk and trying to get tickets home early cause she hates it there. Asks me to do her a favor of waiting on hold for her with the airlines as it\u2019s crazy expensive for her to do it while in another country. So I do it and provide her with whatever info she needed to get. She thanks me and we kinda become friends. Then a few weeks later she explains that she\u2019s in love with me because she\u2019s never meet any other guy that would do the mundane thing of waiting on hold for someone. I laughed, I was caught off guard. I then told her she wasn\u2019t in love with me, and I wasn\u2019t planning on dating her cause of the weird rude thing and this being in love thing just adds to the red flags. I tell her that I\u2019m just a nice guy who likes helping people. But not to fall in love with the only nice guy in her life or the first guy that\u2019s nice to her.  It was strange as hell. I had to explain to her that she wasn\u2019t in love with me.  Haven\u2019t talked to her since, I don\u2019t even remember her name. But the choking thing was weird.",

Why would you 'expect' this person who was essentially a stranger to know what you meant?!\n\nNot at all surprised the date has not responded since, and hope they're ok. Glad you are too OP but unless there's something you've not added here, you did indeed fuck up and hope you've learned that lesson.",

                      "text": "I will answer that question with a question of your own. Let's say someone jumps off a cliff and passes out. How do you think they will land? Doing risky behavior is one thing, but doing risky behavior that actually causes physical harm regularly is the line. And if a person did adrenally junkie things like jumping out of a plane several times a week? Then yeah you might have them see why they are unable to deal with normal pleasurable activities before they have to go revert to something like that so frequently? It's not that they are even being choked to unconsciousness, it's that they are being choked into unconsciousness on a first date with someone they didn't meet and that they had to be put prone restrained on the floor to get off. Their escalation has gotten to a point of danger to themselves. Not simply kinky. (And I'm not even getting to the point of sexual desensitization that they can't feel anything really good unless they're at this point, that's for the postee to determine if it's an issue for them or not or if that's their thing that is their one true kink.)\n\nAgain, they are doing something that puts their life into a state of unconsciousness at a frequent level in a situation with a stranger that is putting their life at risk. Without going into details I know many people who do choke play and there are extremely **and I stress the word extremely** few who do choke play who pass out, let alone who go with first date casual hookups.\n\nBecause why? It is life-threatening even when the partner is not the one causing the life threatening consequences of that like not listening for them to release, or God forbid, deliberately trying to kill them then, and that's when they are conscious! (I'm talking about someone passing out and not waking up which is exactly what can happen if a partner leaves them and they don't realize that they're in such a bad state if we're talking first date fucking choke play unconsciousness. It doesn't happen until it does.) Such a healthy  partnership for this is something that is built on trust, command words, and slow escalation till both partners are at that state because it is such a fucking danger in the first place. \nBut this is not a BDSM subreddit, so I'll leave it there.\n\nDeliberately doing something that makes you unconscious doesn't always mean you have to stop. But if you are deliberately doing it again and again recklessly without prep because you were addicted to the sensation or the event, or covering it up for something else, or that you are no longer getting pleasure from the original method of that, **that** is a warning bell. Again not saying that is what they did there, but showing the potential warning signs to when desensitization is a danger.\n\nHaving sex and being whipped because you no longer enjoy having sex is one thing. Having sex and being whipped until you are unconscious and bleeding that is self-harm. Will say for the sake of this discussion the example didn't get off being bleeding, but if they can't enjoy themselves until they now are whipped to the point that they *are* unconsciously bleeding, that is an unhealthy escalation. \n\nIf your desensitization gets to that point, that is where  one should look into why you are no longer able to get any enjoyment in life unless you are at a dangerous extreme, and that is why professional help exists. It is the same reason we ask people who are cutting themselves to relieve stress to also seek help even if it is nothing but a \"small thing,\" as the cutter would say. \n\n\n\n(I'm not saying any of those other examples were what the OP, was doing; I'm just using other examples of where a line should be drawn when there are potential difficulties, versus kinky/hard sex play. \n\nEven if what they are doing turns out to be healthy, it is really useful that they talk to a person at a professional level to make sure what they're doing is healthy, and  it is not completely covering up; masking; compensating; and/or transferring from a horrible traumatic event or events. But I digress.)\n\nAnd once again, especially when you just have a first meet first fuck situation, and it's very dangerous to screw into traumatic body unconsciousness versus I just screwed until I passed out unconsciousness, when you don't know what can happen to you even if accidentally at risk (let alone the small but potential sociopathic and Psychopathic people  encounter that could do things to you in that vulnerable state.) Screwing until you pass out happily is one thing, but passing out because you did something like choking till the body compensates for oxygen deprivation while also causing your pleasure centers in the brain going into overdrive is a whole other discussion in regards to recovery and response to difficulties the body may or may not have when unconscious, but once  again, I digress.\n\nAnd if you do still not recognize the difference between causing self-harm and being an adrenaline junkie in this scenario after reading this, then I recommend you also look into getting professional help because you may not have a respectable boundary to causing yourself manageable risk. Take risks, but only risks you can actually be conscious to manage or  a person you have faith and trust in if you are not in this conscious situation ever in your life.",

We're not talking about someone who intentionally got choked to pass out, OP just said it has happened before, not that they are seeking it. Just like wing suits are a risk of crashing into a mountain side and dying, so is being choked during sex with someone who doesn't know what they are doing. Not everything you do in life suggest a mental issue, some people are sometimes irresponsible in the heat of the moment. If someone does it with the purpose of self harm, sure they need therapy, but sometimes a kink is just a kink that may have accidentally gone too far once or twice.",

Neither did they tell me nor did I have *any* reason to believe that their kink was the result of trauma. If anything, it was them requesting something they didn't properly think about - which isn't exactly hard, given how prevalent 'rough sex' has become in the media.\n\nNow, is it a *dumb* thing to do? For sure. Immediately dismissing their wish to experience something they think they might enjoy as the result of trauma, though? Not exactly a nice thing to do, is it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>But too many folks assume that what gets them off is immutable.\n\nNot sure what to say to this. You're right, ofc. But putting it like that also kind of suggests that some kinks warrant some sort of .. 'readjustment', almost.\n\n\"If you're into this, surely, there must be something wrong with you. Better find a different kink to enjoy.\"\n\nMeh. Who are you or I to judge?  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af",

But if you do want to cut off some blood to their brain, then yeah, a few seconds would be better than longer, obviously.\n\nThis kink is inherently dangerous/risky. Consenting adults can obviously choose to partake in that risk if they'd like though. Lol",

Sounds like he freaked afterward cuz he realized he'd fucked up and thought you might press charges. Doesn't matter if you asked for it.

That's just as bad as when a male pressures a female into doing something that she's not really comfortable with and that she didn't give consent to prior. You're also clearly an irresponsible person with regards to kink because the number one rule of kink is to get consent prior. The second rule is to make sure both parties are safe and are playing safe. Yet despite those two rules you just wanted your fix and in the process you sexually assaulted someone else.\n\nCongratulations for being a woman who sexually assaulted a man. I personally find you disgusting and I hope the world finds out that you're part of the problem of sexual assault and that you victimized another person. \n\nI hope this man is able to deal with his drama and move forward in a positive way without his life being damaged in a profound way.",

And/or find potential partners among the kinky folx who have already invested in learning fun ways to rough people up.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with liking what you like and wanting what you want.

A rear naked choke puts pressure on the carotid arteries and restricts blood flow as well, it is much much quicker. Best approach if it's utilised in sex is to squeeze very briefly and release.  However it's probably best just going for the old fashioned windpipe one.\n\nBe safe and have fun.",

Safe ways to be choked and how to teach other partners.\n\n\n1. If you really get off that hard, always figure out a way to do it with your own hand.\n\n2. Some people prefer the asphyxiation, some people are okay just slowing blood flow through the carotid. Still other people just want the hand pressure.\n\n3. This is an important thing. Choking specifically, can collapse the trachea, bruise the larynx, damage vocal cords, kill you etc. Depending on your type of choke preference. \nThere's a few ways. For a number of asphyxiation kink ladies, having a partner place the heel of the hands on either side of the trachea,  and squeezing against the back of the neck, will give carotid pressure, and help with the asphyxiation feeling, give the hands around the neck sensation, but doesn't actually inhibit breathing whatsoever.\n\n\nYou owe that man some edible arrangements or a 6-pack of beer, but your probably don't have the address.\nJust leave it alone.

Goodbar, or the real life of the old show Hogans Heroes' actor Robert Crane but: ) The problem with this when not discussed is, that in the middle of sex play, this could go horribly wrong and someone could end up dead because of the spontaneity and excitement of this causing them to overexert and cause said death of the individual.\n\n\nEnjoy your rough play, but be safe about it and don't put your life at risk. See previous comments about the dangers of choking until passing out from me and other posters. I'll leave this comment specifically alone by me now as it's been done a couple times and there are plenty of others that have already commented on this; what you decide in your life is your decision of course.",

One person's \"choke me\" could mean a hand barely touching the neck and another's could be using a tie like a leash on a dog trying to run away. As tempting as going straight in can be, it's really important to have a couple more Vanilla sessions and work towards what you want.\n\nThat being said, this guy did NOT seem taken advantage of. The fact he went straight for a full-arm choke makes it pretty clear to me he was only reluctant because he wasn't prepared for it; not because he wasn't okay with it.",
