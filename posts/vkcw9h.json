And choosing to even set up the glider in a potentially  windy area and stand near it has risks, and we haven\u2019t even started flying yet. Once airborne, there are situations you want to avoid of course. But if you find yourself in one of them, you\u2019ll then have to recognize it and then choose from your now-reduced options, none of which are particularly good. So the question of safety gets re-baselined for the relative safety inherent to the current reality, given that options can evaporate by the second. \n\nSafety can\u2019t be a line that gets drawn and doesn\u2019t move. That\u2019s not thinking about safety, that\u2019s refusing to think. When saying that misoptostol can\u2019t realistically be done without help, are you accounting for the shifting baseline risk environment of a pregnant person who will likely not have access to prenatal care? \n\n\nAnd I\u2019m not accusing you of this. I just have no idea how integrated that type of thinking is in med school or if you don\u2019t really get those ideas until rotations or residency.",

Some states can get the pills within days, but for other states (like Texas) it can take 6-8 weeks. \n\nThese pills only work until about 10 weeks in, which is why it\u2019s important to order in advance. AidAccess has an option for \u201cjust in case\u201d pills (you can also easily lie and say you\u2019re already pregnant, they won\u2019t know either way).\n\nThe pills are good for at least two years.\n\nBut! And this is **very** important now as of yesterday for states where abortion will be banned - **remember to protect your privacy!**\n\nWhen looking for abortion resources, use Tor (or onion browser for iOS) or a PAID VPN service like Mullvad.\n\nUse search engines that better protect your privacy, like Firefox, Duck Duck Go and Brave.\n\nUse Protonmail for encrypted emails, Google Voice for calling clinics and orgs.\n\nAnd use Signal to text family, friends, etc to talk about pregnancy/abortion and make plans.",

Those differences, with the addition of some territorial government politics, meant the populations felt some resentment for each other.\n\nA year after the Dakota territory was formed, the Homestead Act passed. This new law encouraged settlement in the West, as did railroads that connected new farmers to markets for their crops. But the trade routes supported by these railroads connected North and South Dakota to different commercial hubs. The northern part of Dakota territory became more closely tied to Minneapolis-St. Paul, via Fargo and Bismarck. In contrast, the southern counties along the Missouri and Big Sioux rivers were more closely tied by trade to Sioux City, and from there to Omaha or over to Chicago. These diverging economic ties left residents of different parts of the territory less connected to each other.",

Justice Thomas voiced his approval of revisiting the cases that legalized use of contraception, gay sex, and gay marriage. They are absolutely on the chopping block because christian fundamentalism hates them. He conviently left out Loving (which was the case that legalized interracial marriage), but Loving is based off the same arguments the others are, and people like Justice Alito have voiced dissent about Loving.\n\nIf the Reps get control of the presidency, house, and senate during the next election cycles, which might happen with how poorly the Dems are polling, they will then go on to try and pass legislation banning abortion on the federal level. Banning gay sex and marriage would likely be in their crosshairs if they get to that point. After that it's more unclear what their next steps would be",

As a nurse, I feel sick to my stomach about giving away prescription medications that typically need counsel to be used safely; *however,* I feel like the safety risk is much greater without access to these medications, or to D&C's. It is definitely the lesser of two evils, imo.\nAlso, I did have someone tell me that you need *both* misoprostol and mifepristone to terminate a pregnancy -- this is not true. Misoprostol will do it on its own, but it must be administered sublingually or vaginally, and a dose of 200mcg is required (it typically comes in 50mcg tablets, so an amount of at least 4 tablets would be requires, and could possibly end up requiring more to expel everything that needs to be expelled). I'm really grateful TST is fighting to get them made available, and I really hope that something good comes of it.",

It imports more modern terms, with an assumed understanding by the authors about what that passage was about. That was the point of the NIV. There are translations which are less biased assumptions about modern language.\n\nFor instance, where the NIV translates the word \"womb\", the original uses the same word used for \"thigh\". So, saying \"thigh\" there would be more accurate, even if less clear. Whether \"thigh\" refers to \"womb\" in this particular case is an argument that needs to be made: but may be wrong.",

With the story being a permutation of a previous story, orally communicated, with ideas being added by each person who passed it on. Different people contributing different bits with different motivations. Some intentionally, some accidental.\n\nThe idea that this entire thing can be summed up as \"control, government\" is silly. It is, as I said, intellectually vapid. Compressing an incredibly complex history, largely organic, into one concept: that somebody came up with it for one purpose.\n\nMaybe it's USED that way. Maybe at various times by various people, it has always been used that way. Maybe certain passages in certain stories were intended that way.

It's used in many places that aren't about a dead fetus. It says \"thigh to fall away\". We have a specific word for 'miscarry', so we know what we're talking about when we use it. But, 'thigh to fall away', doesn't have an requirement that it be a dead fetus afterwards. Since it doesn't specify or death, or death of the fetus, we have to conclude that there remains \"room\" for it to be also including the possibility of a live birth. \n\n>If a still birth is induces by outside sources it's an abortion, not a still birth.\n\nI never said otherwise.\n\n>Whether every woman receiving this ritual was pregnant isn't what's being debated; what happens to a woman if she's pregnant while receiving the ritual is. If she's pregnant and her belly swells and \"thigh\" rots, what happens to the fetus, is the question. The pretty clear answer is that it gets terminated.\n\nAhh, no, what's actually being debated in this sub thread is whether it is a METAPHORE FOR ABORTION, in your words:\n\n>The more popular KJV wording is that their belly will swell and thigh will rot. It's clearly metaphor for miscarriage/god induced abortion\n\nThat is, we're not debating what would actually happen in a hypothetical real situation where somebody was pregnant, drank a real magic potion, and prayed to a real God, and had their real womb fall out or whatever. We're debating the meaning behind the text. What the author was trying to convey at the time: was he trying to write a metaphor for abortion. If the author never even considered what would happen if the women was pregnant, then the author wasn't trying to write a metaphor about abortion.\n\nIt's like, if I wrote \"eat healthy or you'll feel bad\", am I writing a metaphor for avoiding cancer? No.... I mean, sure, cancer is one way of feeling bad. I know that now. But I didn't think of cancer when writing \"feel bad\". It wasn't even on my mind at the time.\n\n>You're gonna have to source me on this one also\n\nThis is something that was a bit tangential to the original argument, and pretty niche academic, and which I can't do much more than point you to academic papers for. I'm going to drop it as a line of argument for now, since I have to run to the store. Heh.",

The most obvious interpretation is to ask what happens if we just read it at face value, and accept the obvious physical reality: magic doesn't work, and God doesn't exist.\n\nIt's a description of a ritual that a rabbi, at some point, came up with. The goal was to assuage the suspicion of a husband about whether his wife cheated on him. It involves her drinking water mixed with dirt from the floor. And then some prayers to God. And then some unclear passages about whether she'll be incontinent or have a miscarriage.\n\nEither way: it didn't work to cause an abortion. Because we know in reality that dirt from the floor won't do that, nor will oaths to a God. So, in reality, this ritual always came up in favor for the women: it never resulted in her miscarrying (unless you believe in magic or God). The MOST it could do is cause incontinence. But even a bit of dirt is unlikely to do that. So, chances are she was simply always found not-guilty of cheating.\n\nAnd a rabbi who came up with this PROBABLY could figure that out. I mean, he knows he's making up some ritual about dirt. He knows it won't cause a miscarriage. So why did he invent it?\n\nTo trick the husband. To get him to leave her alone and take her back. A made up ritual just to make the problem go away, and restore the couple. GG rabbi.\n\nThat's what I think is the most likely historical reasoning behind the trial. It's an invention by a, somewhat sexist (but normal for the time) rabbi to simply reduce harm to everybody involved, while working with a system that viewed adultery as pretty bad.",

We supposedly are speaking of believers interpreting their holy text. If their response is \"its all bullshit anyway\" then they already gave up the entire debate.\n\n\n>Either way: it didn't work to cause an abortion.\n\nAnd all the magic of the Bible didn't happen, you can't seriously think this is a good defense. Like no shit man wasn't made of mud or women of man's rib, the sun didn't stand still in the sky, the earth didn't flood. If you are taking these people at their word then there is magic beyond the material world.\n\n> And a rabbi who came up with this PROBABLY could figure that out. I mean, he knows he's making up some ritual about dirt. He knows it won't cause a miscarriage. So why did he invent it?\n\nFirst, there are plenty of charlatans that believe their own bullshit abilities, so you can't jump to that conclusion. More importantly, this interpretation couldn't be used by anyone who takes the Torah as a reliable document because the assumption is that it is actually lying and manipulating you. Under that this interpretation, the rabbi might have just wanted to line his pockets with more money or cover up one of his indiscretions. It takes the document from a divine thing to one of propaganda, which I am more than willing to acknowledge but you can't pretend that is how the vast majority of believers interact with it.\n\n> GG rabbi.\n\nNah, he could just advocate for real moral principals instead of lies and trickery.",

He pointed out many thing, original sin doesn't exist and the bad guy of that story was god, how in sodomah and gomorrah the homosexuality was not the problem, how in all this book heaven and hell are not mentioned, and that god never said \"love me\" always \"fear me\", the free from egypt story was just a problem made by god and solved by god to just show how fearfull he can be, that the bible is not monotheist and a lot of other stuff that theology change. Basically if you read the bible(alone wothout a priest whispering in your ear)  you discover that theology and church don't start from the bible and build the religion but from the idea that they want the religion to be, than they try to find this idea in the bible by building a lot of castle and reasoning very similar to the one that flat earther do to explain why the earth is flat, this way you can make the bible say whatever you want.",

Noticing that a new generation were becoming ignorant of God\u2019s rules for mankind as presented in the Bible, he took it upon himself to make sure nobody in the country would be able to say they didn\u2019t know the Ten Commandments ever again, thus combatting juvenile delinquency.\"",

It's pretty damn explicit in the constitution. \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\"",

They held up judicial placements for years and once Trump was in place they sat hundreds of planted judges all over the US. \n\nI'm not sure if there is a watchdog out there yet keeping track of those judges' rulings, but I would like to see some sort of data on how their rulings reflect the will of the people and the actual law as written / the judgements from person to person, issue to issue. I obviously have a hypothesis that the rulings won't be equitable, we already have that issue now. We have sentence disparities, and due to this we had judicial reform for a brief moment in time. But, of course, the judges didn't like it and repealed it for themselves (we clearly need a new mechanism for that, they can't be making their own rules, hello) so we already know it's a problem, and these judges are like, let's face it, places by fascists to do fascist things. So that's my hypothesis and I'd liked to see data on how their rulings are going, compared to judges seated by people who don't own Confederate flags. I just highly suspect it's not good, but I would love to be surprised. (I don't have the capacity to track them all and analyze it all, I could do a few maybe. I guess if there is a group working on it Id join to help the research aspect or whatever)",

They're no where to be found in these radical Christian churches regularly talking about the genocide of gay people that their holy book explicitly calls for. \n\nThe Catholic, babtist, 7th day Adventists, Mormons, all of them have a holy book that explicitly calls for the rape and murder of others for dominance of Abrahamic religions. \n\nOnes personal ethics don't matter if their group will kick them out for non compliance, as Catholics have done throughout the history of their church. Look at Jesuits in South America, completely fucked over by their church and murdered for trying to act more like Jesus, helping the poor and so on. \n\nCatholics enforce some nonsense within their own ranks that demands compliance.",

It\u2019s not you. \n\nBut let\u2019s start at the top Amazon Smile is a 501c3. That means that anything you buy there is already exempt (major tax loophole) but of course you feel good that your .5% of what you are buying is going to an organization of your choice. Meanwhile Amazon paid $0 in taxes last year because they are tricky bastards. \n\nSecond, Having worked at a nonprofit people seem to think that donations through Amazon Smile are good enough. But really it just shrinks the total donations you get. If every time someone bought something off of Amazon smile they have us $1 I would have an extremely different budget. \n\nThis is the charitable giving version of green washing. I could go on but I digress, I don\u2019t care if you use Amazon smile. Just give your own money to the organizations you care about, it is so much more effective for them and you can write it off.

And I always hated god... I pretended to love him out of fear but I knew deep down myself he was a useless asshole. I was never really an atheist but I wasn't religious either. I just tried to pray who the christians tried to impose as the one true god because maybe it would work.\n\nBut it never worked. God made me miserable and weak. I tried to kill myself twice, went into some really dark depression. Last month I finally asked Lucifer for help, I was about to kill myself for good and he was everything I had left because NOTHING else worked. Truth to be told, I always liked lucifer, even as a kid.\n\nSo I went to the forest alone, and I asked Lucifer to help me, to make me a better person, to guide me towards my destiny, to give me inspiration (I wanted to make a music album for almost 6 years but creative blocks prevented me from doing anything). Well believe me or not, the moment I asked for his help I felt this very warm ball of energy enter my chest... I felt so much love and extasy. For 3 entire days I was unable to sleep, I was so full of energy that I just wanted to conquer the world. I suddenly started hearing amazing songs in my head: Every day I would hear a new song, unlike anything I've heard before. And now, I'm halfway through the writing process of my new album, everything is going great and I'm sure it's going to be a huge success because it's seriously amazing music. Almost unbelievable at times.\n\nMy depression is entirely gone, I feel so good in my head, I look happier, I'm more motivated and focused. I don't feel any hatred anymore. Somehow all of my expenses are being covered in one way or another, I receive money on all ends. You wouldn't believe how much he helps his own, he treats us like his own sons and daughters.\n\nI don't want to be too pushy about my belief on a sub about atheism but I noticed that Atheists tend to like Lucifer so I hope I'm not annoying anyone here. Lucifer saved my life while god left me to rot in my misery. Fascism and extreme hatred is always done in the name of the abrahamic god. He's the real evil cunt, with his army of blind cultists who murdered their way across the world.",

A multitude of sources make it clear that we believe life begins at birth and fetuses do not have the legal status of a human being, explicitly refuting the claim that abortion is murder (*Breshit* 2:7, *Shemot* 21:22-23, *Mishna Arakhin *1:4). Moreover, under the principal of *Pikuach Nefesh*, there are times when abortion is not only permissible, but it\u2019s actually demanded (*Mishna Oholot* 7:6). The principal, which demands that a mother prioritize her own health over the health over the health of her fetus, extends to mental health as well as physical. \n\nSo while I certainly applaud the satanic temple\u2019s approach here, it\u2019s not even necessary to rely on farcical practices (which are more likely to be dismissed as not bona fide) for this ruling to be a clear case of religious discrimination.",

      "text": "Good luck with that. America doesn't support real religious freedom; America only supports orthodox Christian supremacy. Even legitimate religious practice is not respected unless it falls under the umbrella of orthodox Christianity.\n\nFor the full active practice of my religion, for example, I require access to entheogenic drugs - from ancient entheogens like DMT, 5-MEO-DMT, and psilocybin, all the way to modern compounds created through the growth of human awareness like LSD. I specifically mention psychedelics because they're what I see value in as entheogens, but really any compound a person believes to be important to spiritual growth, for whatever reason, falls under the same category, and it's not up to the state to determine what a persons religious beliefs require and what they don't. The drug war is inherently an attack on the religious rights of anyone who believes in the use of ANY kind of entheogenic drug... and in the modern day that may seem like a small concern, but that's only because western, Christian, morality swept through the entire damn world and wiped out many traditional religious practices through cultural expansion - like what happened to the native Americans who used peyote. If they aren't going to respect genuine religious practice, what makes anyone think they'll respect a pseudo-religious political organization claiming a religious tenet as a form of political theater?\n\n(After saying that I wanna be clear, full support for what the Satanic Temple is doing, take nothing in this post as a criticism of their actions. I'm only saying that this is effectively nothing but a political statement, because if even legitimate religious beliefs are ignored in favor of orthodox Christian supremacy, an insincere religious tenet created by a political organization is going to be laughed out of court. It shouldn't be, because the state does not get to determine what beliefs are legitimate or what religious tenets need to be followed by the practitioners of a faith, but that's the way it is.)\n\nUntil the state stops treating the right of orthodox Christians to freely practice as equivalent to a right for them to enforce their morality on the rest of society, free religion does not exist. Freedom *of* religion requires freedom *from* religion, and that doesn't just apply to atheists. Unfortunately Christian supremacy is the law of the day, and I expect this to go nowhere.",

Swim, the 1973 decision sanctioning fetus removal all through the United States.\n\nYet, a claim documented last week by a South Florida gathering place difficulties new regulation in the state prohibiting most early terminations following 15 weeks, saying it disregards the State Constitution's all in all correct to security and opportunity of religion. In Jewish regulation, the suit contends, \"fetus removal is required if important to safeguard the wellbeing, mental or actual prosperity of the lady.\"\n\nThe claim, recorded by Congregation L'Dor Va-Dor, a dynamic gathering place in Palm Beach County not subsidiary with a more extensive division, may confront a difficult move in court. Yet, it is an update that fetus removal presents strict issues past those of the Christian right. Furthermore, it proposes potential lawful issues that could surface when Roe appears liable to be upset, and the Supreme Court has been forcefully open to a more extensive job for religion in broad daylight and political life.",

Everything in direct opposition to any establishment christianity or Catholic sermon I had ever had the displeasure of sitting through. Hellfire and brimstone was tempered by the love the Immortal's only begotten son. The love for humanity that he sacrificed himself for. To see that hatred never left power even after all this time would have Jesus Weeping. \n\nBut that's all from when I was religious.

If you are being extremely reductive,  sure. But obviously there's more nuance to it then that. You can't just claim that something is a ritual in your religion that has no rituals. \n\nIf I'm wrong, show me. Nowhere on their website do they mention this ritual. No tenets cover it, there's no guide or writings at all. They simply say \"it's a ritual as of right now. Abortion is the central part of the ritual\" with no further details.  Do you honestly think a judge is going to rule in their favor based on such a claim?",
