The trucks were either loaded with people in the back with paintball guns and cosplay gear, or had the typical fascist flags (gadsden, thin blue line, trump, confederate etc) hanging from the tailgate.\n\nThese weren't people who had to go to the store for a carton of milk and then got hung up by protesters blocking their way.\n\nThese are people that DELIBERATELY showed up at the protests to antagonize the protesters, push through them to trigger a response, and the instant a protester slapped the hood of the truck, the sped off at full speed running people over, which is how they claim self defense. \n\nThat is EXACTLY what Rittenhouse did. \n\nWe have a giant gaping hole in our legal system that allows crucial context like this to be left out of these cases. Rittenhouse wasn't going for a stroll down his neighborhood. He DELIBERATELY drove across state lines to act as a vigilante. \n\nHe had no business being there in the first place.\n\nAnd may I remind you that leaving a bad situation and coming back to it eliminates your grounds of self defense. \n\nAnyone remember the Michael Giles case? \n\nhttps://famm.org/stories/michael-giles-no-ordinary-defendant/\n\n1. Was in a violent situation (not participating in the violence).\n2. Left the situation to go to a rental car to look for his friends.\n3. Didn't find his friends. Grabbed a gun he had there in case he needed it.\n4. *Went back into the violent situation* to look for his friends. \n5. Ended up needing to use the gun in self defense\n6. Currently serving 25 years *even though he was acquitted of the murder charge*. \n\nIf you deliberately put yourself in a risky situation in which you end up having to use lethal force to defend yourself, your ability to claim self defense takes a massive hit (well, if you're black anyway). \n\nIf we applied the same standards of the Michael Giles case to George Zimmerman, the redneck fucks that chased down and murdered Ahmaud Arbery, and Rittenhouse, they should all be going to prison for a very, very long time.",

Even if we *did* slap him with such a minor charge, the message of his acquittal on murder charges will be heard loud and clear by the people who are [actively chomping at the bit to act as a death squad](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/27/when-do-we-get-use-guns-ongoing-danger-false-fraud-claims/). \n\nThis will embolden people to carry out assassinations of protesters. It will be full blown domestic terrorism committed by unofficial gestapo-like squads of losers.\n\nThe government cannot truly prohibit protests (even though they try), but what they can do is *stand aside* and let murderous psychopaths keep protests in check. That is the message a Rittenhouse acquittal will send. Protesters better get ready for a dramatic increase in armed conflict.",

I don\u2019t really feel any sympathy for this kid, but it is fucked up that this idiot 17 year old is on trial and not the police ground commander there or the proud boys leadership.

He got hit a couple of times and then fired his fucking gun at them. Oh no, not an owie. If you can owie me then I can kill you, wtf. He was marching down the street clearly in shock from what he had done already and just couldn't handle the pressure. He should have stopped and put the gun down but he didn't, and that's why people tried to stop him - because he looked like he was on a crazed mission which is exactly the apparent truth from the footage. The armed guy that got shot in the arm was self-defense, I can give him that (in the same way that shooting a cop trying to shoot you is self-defense). But everything else was absolutely not.",

Smiling usually means that a particular individual is showing signs of happiness. To know that this man is showing signs of happiness is absolutely disgusting! This person is drinking with individuals and wearing a t-shirt that supports the oppression of a certain group of ethnic people, due to the colour of their skin. He is also making a white power symbol with his hands in this photo. This is a person that literally murdered two people, due to his discriminatory beliefs. So yeah, I think he and his smile is disgusting, because of his actions.\n\nEdit: He decided to join this particular group of people. I understand that right-wing groups pray on \u201coutcasts\u201d, but ultimately he made the decision to support this disgusting ideology.\n\nLDR: the intent behind the smile is disturbing",

If you don't think \"God Bless the USA\" is a notably Trumpian song you're fooling yourself. It's 100% okay to listen to the song without caring about its social connotation, enjoying music isn't inherently biased, but symbols retain their symbolism regardless of your opinions on them.\n\nFor your everyday Joe Shmoe, having it as your ringtone is innocuous. However, this is a judge in a court of law. The fact that the song has a notable partisan connotation should be enough of a reason for someone who should want to appear as unbiased as possible to not have it as their ringtone. There are also some missteps leading up to a judge's phone going off in court, including not having their phone on silent and having it up loud enough to be audible. Wisconsin court rule CR02-9 states, \"all court proceedings shall be free from interruption by the sounding of electronic devices such as cell phones, pagers, beepers, and electronic watches.\" The judge can waive this requirement, but I'd hope a judge would want to hold himself to the rules he enforces in his own court, and I'd *especially* hope he wasn't expecting an important enough call to waive that requirement for himself during such an obviously high-profile case. All this being the case, the possibility that the ringtone is a far-right dogwhistle has merit, and if it's not true, the fact that the judge let it happen is *very* crass.\n\nBut that's all irrelevant since you've already proven your requirements for argument change when presented with anything valid. You started by saying it's a stretch to say \"God Bless the USA\" is a Trump song, but when you were presented with evidence showing the song has a known Trump connotation, you changed your requirement to be that Trump owns the song. Now someone's trying to argue that Trump owning the song is irrelevant to the argument and provided a well-written response with examples of why that is, and instead of arguing that, you're requiring that your point be nullified for arguments against it to be valid. That's moving the goalposts.\n\nAlso, requiring absolute defense is a shitty way to argue in general and impossible to actually achieve in a subjective argument. Your first claim was fine, but tacking on concrete requirements to a subjective argument completely protects you from having to actually defend your point. You need \"God Bless the USA\" to *solely* be a Trump song, and you need Trump to own the song, the former of which is literally impossible to prove either way and neither are necessary for something with symbolism to act as a dogwhistle. Add in that you require your claim to be nullified, and you have a completely inarguable point that protects you from the possibility of being wrong. Again, shitty way to argue.",

If he's biased or prejudiced in some way, that's entirely relevant to the discussion of \"whether or not he's a Trump supporter.\"\n\nYou implied more heavily then when pol pot said he wasn\u2019t to fond of the Cambodian university of excellence. The fact that the judge loves his country is totally irrelevant to this case as this case is nothing to do with the us vs ritten. It\u2019s about ritten vs a mob of rioters, and as we have seen in a literal multi layered analysis of various angles (including a fucking heat map provided by the fbi) he was obviously and blatantly defending himself.\n\nOr is this because you are apart of the neoliberal brigade seething because it really is a open and shut case of self defence, clutching at any and all straws that you can to try to get the young lad in jail.",

Chasing Kyle Rittenhouse, yelled \"fuck you\" and reached for Rittenhouse's weapon when shot. Violent felon.\n\nGaige Paul Grosskreutz, charged with burglary, prowling, criminally convicted for weapons possession while intoxicated. Not a felon. Admitted in court that Rittenhouse did not shoot when Grosskreutz had hands up, admitted in court that Rittenhouse shot after Grosskreutz pointed his handgun at Rittenhouse. Definitely violent.\n\nAnthony Huber, convicted domestic abuser. Convicted of strangulation and suffocation, false imprisonment, use of a deadly weapon in domestic abuse. Shot after violent assault on Rittenhouse.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse, no criminal history. Cleaned up graffiti, extinguished fires, rendered medical aid the night of the shooting.\n\nIf the argument is about intent or state of mind at all, which it must be to convict Rittenhouse of murder, then it's fair to examine the historical disposition of all involved.\n\n>And what makes you think they weren\u2019t there peacefully?\n\nAll three committed assault on Rittenhouse before they were shot that night. That's not peaceful.\n\n>Had these 3 been law-abiding citizens their entire lives what would be your justification?\n\nHad they never broken any laws, Rittenhouse would not have needed to defend himself.\n\n>You think minors can do whatever the fuck they want? Think again.\n\nMinors have the right of self defense. I hope you aren't arguing that a child's presence caused three peaceful protesters to go mad and turn violent, and that they were only willing to cause harm because they saw the boy. Well, maybe that's true about Rosenbaum who died the way he lived, trying to touch an unwilling minor.",
