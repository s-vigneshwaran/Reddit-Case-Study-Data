They've both stopped seeing eachother since a few years, he's with a girl his age now and she's married. My friend doesn't really regret what he did - he certainly wasn't traumatised by it when he told me (he almost sounded boastful).\n\n3. Do you think something magically happens at 12:00 am on the night of a person's 18th birthday? How is it rape when there's literally no harm, when he literally enjoyed it, and when *HE* was the one who suggested they do it? Do you honestly believe that every human being who's ever had sex with someone below 18 across history and culture is an evil, sadist rapist? How can you say that whilst possessing even a shred of intellectual integrity? Are people in UK rapists for having sex with 17 year olds? Grow up",

If she was a minor too at 16 or 17 and they both were enthusiastic to do it, then it would be different. But the lady was 30. Also, she should have said no and turned down his advances because he was too young. But she didn\u2019t, which leads me to believe that she groomed him to this point. Edit: You wouldn\u2019t be saying that he wasn\u2019t raped if the roles were reversed. There is a power dynamic, just with age, not gender.",
