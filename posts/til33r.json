Thats more hypocrisy. Whataboutism is bringing a third party involved.\n\n \"X is commiting crimes\" \n\n\"but what about Y? Youre not mad at their crimes!\"\n\nThats whataboutism \n\n\"X is commiting crimes\" \n\n\"You committed the same crime. \" \n\nSeems more like hypocrisy.\n\nTo be clear, since libhawks are at full 2004 iraq war levels rn, im not defending or justifing the russian invasion or putin. \n\nIm saying that we dont have the moral high ground everyone cheering for the Ukrainian and russian bodies being thrown in the meat grinder to fuel their bloodlust think we do.",

Also dressed like antifa which the neo Nazis for Trump-Putin  did over and over. Some on January 6th were videoed bragging about how they impesonated antifa and attacked cops. Two Oakland cops were killed by Boogaloo Bois dressed as Antifa. Portland and Seattle were attacked by hundreds of neo Nazis from the eastern pafrts of the states.  Fa rightiwngers drove vecles unto crowds of protesters 112 times killing 16 and defaced monuments of Jefferson, Lincoln and others. \n\nTo be fair some BLM extremists vandalized police cars early in  the protests but that stopped quickly and never happened again.  There was no real villence by the left in any of the protests except one self defence shooting by an Antifa guy. He wanted to surrender and confessed but Trump had him murdered.\n\nDr Fauci is a totally fact based apolitical lifelong public servant and is known as the #1 expert on epidemics in the world When he speaks he speaks for the top 200 in his field, a concensus. So it is not even him speaking for himself. he saved countless lives and yet Rusian paid Rand Paul attacked him with lies 100+ time and ran fundraising emails every time after every attack.  Paul ought to be locked up. Anti vaxxer anti mask nti shutdown covid pushers cost us an xtra 700,000 dead, and they did it on purpose, with Putin behind tem every step of the way. They also ended up making shutdowns and economic damage worse. In FL and TX the local and business leaders ignored their pro covid governors Desantis and Abbott and kept the death rate from skyrocketing but the GOP governors did the best they could to kill as many as possible. God nows why. It was so evil and stupid.",

However the murdering, arson and attacks on protesters and police continued, 100% of it by the far right Maga types.\n\nAntifa means anti fascist which all Americans should agree with. Some of them are willing to engage in violence,  but only against neo Nazis.  The only known act of violence by an Antifa protester was in  Portland where a neo Nazi pulled a gun on an Antifa guy and a black guy, about to shoot. The Antifa drew and shot fist. he killed the neo Nazi, then confessed online, pleaded self defense and awaited cops to surrender. Instead Trump sent a contingent of radicalized  marshals who surrounded his home and opened fire a la Bonnie and Clyde, murdering him even though he wanted to surrender. That was the only known case of Antifa or BLM violence.\n\nAlso, Biden and Harris both condemned any vandalism, rock throwing or looting right away, and obviously no democrats approve of that.  But Trump did approve of as much violence as possible and even ordered the Pentagon to send troops into the streets to murder the protesters a la Putin.  The Pentagon told him that was unconstitutional and Trump was furious. Trump wanted a racist war to be able to declare martial law and cancel the election he lost.\n\nThe job of the unmarked DHS federal gestapo he sent to Portland was to kill protesters. They arrived after the protests had simmered down and started a new protest against themselves.  But the protesters put their Moms in front of the crowd , a barrier of women, and that stopped the gestapo.  That night 100+ pickup trucks full of far right instigators invaded Portland. That was the night the Antifa guy killed one in self defense. The guys in the picks were all neo Nazis and Amon Bundy types. They wanted a race war though 90% of the Portland protesters were white.",

Now on the far right if you even believe in democracy you are called a marxist. So pathetically anti American.\n\nAs we see from the 500+ idiots arrested for January 6th, these are the country's worst most gullible losers.  Most are very ugly too so they are the dregs of the white race.  PLus now by following Trump and betraying their country they have ruined their lives. They will forever be known as traitors, Putin tools and terrorists.  Plus since they all cried and confessed, we know they are all cowards.  Just like one of their leaders, the Russian agent Michael Flynn whose Turkish paymaster was Putin's best friend from the KGB, and Trump made him national Security advisor to make sure our enemy got a close look at all our top secrets.\n\nThank God for Biden, that's all I can say.",

The list goes on and on.  And ron desantis and the entie Treason Caucus in congress.  Ron Johnson, Devin Nunes, Josh Hawley,l NY Post, Breitbart, Bannon, so many, too many to list.  Of course Putin never leves a paper trail of his control and ownership, but the FCC is investigating now and they will find a lot of Russian money in rightwing US media, tons of it.",

Biden has the smartest people in the country advising him, not political yes men idiots like Trump had, and they are telling him to be strong and keep pressuring Putin from every direction, but also do not use the US military to attack Putin.

There are literal slave camps in Siberia where they ship Roma and Muslim people, and the Buryats live in ghettos and have been forces to join Putin's army and have made up a large percentage of his legion. If that's what you mean be integration then sure, but essentially if you are not of what Putin describes as a pure Slav then chances are much like with Ukrainians, your language and culture have been stolen from you. And there is no true electoral process there anyways. I see what you were sort of trying to say but I just have to mention becauase after being a minority there with Tatar and Azerbaijani family I have no intention of giving any credit to Russia, even when compared to other places.",

And now I think of it considering native Africans weren't allowed to own property or land in liberia until 1980, they would have obviously earned more tax if the freed slaves never created the two tier racial system. So this was actually against their own selfish interests. The freed slaves enslaved the Africans for the same reason any people enslaved people, because they could. Sorry but there's a lot of maybes in your response, and it seems you're trying to hypothesis a way to put the blame onto white people, rather than discussing the actual history. Which again I find a bit racist towards black people, as you are suggesting they don't have a mind of their own, and white people have been in complete control of their existence, which is just very patronising. Can I ask, do you think white people are somehow uniquely evil? Because that's what you seem to be suggesting.",

The video being discussed in this thread is a vice documentary on YouTube, if you just want the general history of Liberia. I dont see how it can be patronising to any group in particular, as I suggested its the reason everyone did it. Its just one of the horrible truths about humanity. And noone is dismissing it, and I agree the empires of Europe committed domination, manipulation and subversion. But you seem to be suggesting thats somehow unique to Europe when its how every empire that ever existed operated. The mongolian and chinnese empires did the same thing in Asia,  in Africa the empire of mali, Egypt and kemit all did the same. And the mesopatamian empire before that.",

Except they weren\u2019t the first peoples to discover Alaska, in fact, Native American tribes like the Yuits had already been living their for 1000s of years. Further, the reason they colonized Alaska was for ivory from Walrus tusks. And as you can imagine, their treatment of native groups wasn\u2019t exactly kind (http://alaskaweb.org/russam/interactions.htm). So yes, Russia\u2019s colonization of Alaska is imperialism just like Americas purchase of the state was imperialism. Two things can both be bad and imperialism is not mutually exclusive to the west.

What lead you to believe it was anything else?\n\nEdit: I mean the original, not the retweeter. I didn't check the retweeter's profile.\n\nEdit 2: retweeter is almost 100% Russian propaganda with a few meaningless anti-capitalist memes. Both twitter profiles are pretty obviously trolls.",

And yes, just because I have texas apparel on means I live there, better let all those folks with the \"I \u2661 NY\" clothes know.\n\nDon't try to educate me on firearms, because I guarantee I've forgotten more than you'll ever know about them. While it wouldn't be wise to bring that gun to a close range gun fight, the Model 29 Silhouette was (as it's name states) a target revolver aimed at competitive shooters in Silhouette shooting competitions. It's front sight is adjustable from 100-400 yards, that's immensely far for a handgun. Plus .44 magnum carries a whole lot more oomph than any Glock, Beretta or CZ does.\n\nNow if you'd have gone a little further in my post history you'll see that I own plenty of modern guns, you silly goose. Including two CZs since those guns are great. \n\nAside from all that, it seems like you've got a lot of anger in you. You took all that time to look through my post history, create an imgur post, learn what gun I was holding, and then insult me further with ad hominem. And you keep using racist terms like \"hick\". \n\nhttps://youtu.be/9Deg7VrpHbM\n\nI don't know who or what has made you so negative, but I am genuinely here to talk to if you need someone. I realize just because you and I disagree on something doesn't mean you're a bad person or an idiot. I don't wish anything bad on you because, in the end, you and I both have people that care about us, we're both just making our ways through life. That's all anyone can ask.\n\nSeriously though, have a good day. \ud83d\udc4d",

Good job with your grammar, clearly you didn't go to a Texas school lol.\n\nYou act like I have disdain for the US fucking up the confederates in the Civil War, Texas hardly had anything to do with it in the first place. On top of that, what kind of Texan, or American for that matter, roots for the Confederacy? That is no different than rooting for the Axis Powers during WW2. Do you just assume that since I'm from Texas I must be some racist tool that slaps a Stars and Bars flag on everything, even though you yourself are from Texas? Again, good job with that superiority complex, fool.\n\nJust because you do 3 gun doesn't mean you know fuckall with guns, that's like saying \"oh I go to NASA museums, that means I can work on the space shuttle\".\n\nI think I'm the bees knees when it comes to firearms because I am, not because I'm Texan.

I can guarantee that I can outshoot you with any and all guns that you or I have.

The problem was that to have overseas colonies one first needs access to the sea, much of Russian imperial history consists of Russia trying to find a port to the sea so that they too could become an imperial sea power.\n\nIn that journey they of course took large swaths of land from Siberia, to the caucuses and Finland. Istanbul, or Tsargrad as they called it was supposed to be the great port that started Russia\u2019s overseas colonial ambitions but the British beat them during the Crimean War in the 1860s to prevent them from doing so.\n\nTo this day Russia is a fairly multi ethnic empire, and since Chechnya, Putin has done a rather good job of keeping that empire in line he\u2019s been rather good at wielding both the carrot and the stick to keep his non Russian constituents in line.",

The rest are poor Caucasus and Asian countries that have no significant military power. The only reason those countries are still allies is because they are either run by Russian puppets, or because Russia would invade them and install a new government instantly if they decided to stop cooperating. They're allies because they don't really have a choice. And it's not like they haven't tried to break free, because most of them have, but Russia shut that shit down real quick every time. The ones who had a choice pretty much all joined NATO. That's not to say they love NATO, or that NATO gave them the choice to be completely independent and neutral, but they clearly thought it was better than being allied with Russia. \n\n\n\nI'm not saying the west is any better. Western countries have in my opinion been worse when it comes to colonialism and imperialism, especially if we're not just talking 20th century. They have done things just as bad as russia, and so much worse. I'm just saying Russia definitely used to be an imperial overlord as well.",

If you wish to stretch the term to mean those things, then western ideologies are colonizing the world still today through media by an ideological colonization, and thus still in Africa too. Except western media, like Hollywood and porn, are spreading liberal ideologies, many African groups have been struggling with the effects of porn in a part of the world where AIDS is a problem, it has changed their sexual norms in a detrimental way, not unlike virus filled blankets. \n\n\nAnyhow, I acknowledged that colonialism was problematic, but historical context is extremely important, the standards of what was accepted were much different than today. Everyone took land by force, everyone had slaves, those were the agreed-upon rules Everyone was playing by. The west was the first part of the world to at least start changing the slavery standards and start phasing it out. When white slave traders were coming to Africa how do you think they were getting the slaves? hunting them in a malaria-filled harsh climate? They were buying them from tribes who enslaved other tribes. That's why America never tried to colonialize during the slave trade, it was after cures for malaria that colonialism began. After slavery to America was over. While Arabs were still trading slaves, an estimate of 2million, during the 19th century, the time of colonialism. \n\nNor is ethic cleansing a western invention. Indians in America were doing all these things for example. The Congo had genocide, which with the Hutu and Tutsi continued into the 90s. While Chad just recently got rid of slavery. \n\nIt's not so simple as colonialism caused every evil in the world. It's not like the world was a garden of Eden and the white man brought sin to it. History doesn't start with colonialism.",

It was the norm that anyone you conquer became your slave and everyone played by these rules. Genocide didn't mean anything till after world War 2 when it was coined, before that it was just killing off a group so their children didn't seek revenge later. \nThis stuff was going on till at least the 7th century in Asia. And you've probably seen Viking movies or played a Viking video game, that was the 11th century, they had no problem with some pretty nasty things. While the Arabs enslaved anyone they conquered into the 16th century. And the Aztecs were doing human sacrifice up till the 16th century\nScience develops, we don't have all science there is or will be right now, we're still constantly learning new things. That (science) came from western civilization, even what was developed by the Arabs was with the help of greek slaves. And science was used to justify slavery in its time. \nAs I was arguing it was the west that was trying to end all these things while the rest of the world was still practicing them, the way it still does with stuff like female circumcision. There was a time in history when these things became thought of as wrong and it wasn't a \"long-ass\" time ago it was only about 200 years ago. Ironically you're using a western morality you got from western civilization to condemn wester behaviors in the past, not everyone had that morality. \n I'm not using this to justify it, I'm saying that's just how history has worked, people's morality develops as we learn more. History is in part a branch of moral philosophy where we study past acts to learn from them, and used by moral philosophy. \nFor example, we thought cigarettes and sugar were fine 60 years ago, the science even said so, turns out the cigarette and sugar companies were funding that science and now trying to sell cigarettes and sugary foods to kids is condemned, but till then we didn't know the consequences, we didn't have lung cancer issues or huge amounts of diabetes.  Up till the 80s camels marketing was all about trying to make it appealing to a younger generations to hook a new generation. That's now condemned. This is still an ongoing process.",

That's all west means.\n \nHow about chilling out about hating half the world just because they had some accomplishments that others didn't? Im sorry, you are ignorant of so much of world history but being hate-filled to a group's accomplishments isn't going to make you sound more informed! And I genuinely hope you can acquire an education in history. \n \nYet, we can still acknowledge the accomplishments of Asia, Persia, and the Middle East, but that doesn't somehow changes anything about the west's achievements. \n\nAnd I'm sorry Arabs were slave traders,  well into the Atlantic slave trade and beyond. They made slaves of Europeanans and that includes Greeks. A harem was in part a place to educate those women,  who were some of the best-educated women brought from other lands. Greek slaves were highly prized by all cultures including Rome and used as educators\n\n\nI cant write a response to the comments below this so for the recor here is my responds:\nReddit is blocking my responses, which is pretty telling of your ideas that you cowardly hide behind reddit moderates and dont allow me to message you. Like the fascist leftist fucktarded wanna be commise who cant read marx would.\n\neverything you said is either a straw man or backed up with nothing. Source any of it, I don't care about your resentful opinion. you've time and again demonstrated complete ignorance of world history, speaking only in vague general terms, with no examples, so your opinions on it are of little value at this point.  what was the rest of the world ahead of in anything you mentioned? Greeks invented philosophy not science per se, although philosophy is a science with different methods, and many of them were doing that while living in Italy, so no geographic spot isn't the reason for their accomplishments. it was that they had a cultural tradition of it that they learned generation by generation and got better at it. And show many any group that wasn't killing everyone else in the last millillia, you seem to subscribe to the noble savage myth, that everyone was innocent like Pocahontas, till the white man came. And back up your claim that whiteness didn't come from America, mine is based on Ellis Island records, where it was decided who was white and who wasnt.",

The fact that you think sucking off Europe means you\u2019re educated and criticizing it means you aren\u2019t is just annoying. Europe was behind most of the world in a number of ways for millennia, be it cultural institutions, economic structure, education, agriculture, astronomy, medicine, biology, surgery, psychology, neuroscience, European \u201cracial science\u201d, and plenty more. Europe only started to truly and distinctly pull ahead when they were killing everyone else and destroying what they had. I\u2019m sorry to tell you this, but arbitrary land borders don\u2019t define who is good at science. Greeks aren\u2019t naturally better at science you nitwit. They\u2019re just people from a specific spot on earth. That doesn\u2019t make you better or worse, and Baghdad was better educated than Greece.

Forced migration of Persian speaking communities during Iran-Russian wars, destruction of ingenious Siberians, destruction of polish-Lithuanian communities during division of Commonwealth, destruction of Muslim communities during their wars with Ottomans and other Turkish groups, destruction of native American communities in Alaska, forced migration of mongols and Chinese during their eastward expansion and etc.\n\nForced migrations were the equivalent of slave trade in many countries such as Mughal, Iran or Russia. Something that was continued to be practiced well into the 20th century. It was pretty common for tribes and nomadic groups to be forcefully relocated to places were the government had trouble finding workers like mining towns where forcefully migrated people had no other choice but to work for any job the government gave them in order to be able to afford living.",
