And sure there are wait times for your smaller issues, my mother recently had to wait ~10 at emergency to get a iron shot at emergency but that's also bc of covid, but she was able to get it done. BUT she was able to see our gp to even tell her to get the iron shot on a days notice and then go in at her own leisure to get it.\n\nMy friend who lives in the states went through 3 months of trying to just get a doctor that was inside his new insurance network, then it took another 3 months just to see them, just for them to deny him his PREVIOUSLY PRESCRIBED MEDS because they thought he was just looking to get high. So now he's had to wait another 2 months, where they've rescheduled twice for an appointment to meet in person to get those meds.\n\nPeople talk about emergency care and how it's super expensive in the states but also the wait times are horrendous if you don't have super good insurance. And the care isn't even that good.",

Same with teachers; it's a perpetual problem and I don't think many provincial governments are doing enough to incentivize doctors to work in those areas.\n\nLack of pharmacare, vision, dental, and psych care coverage is also frustrating. I often wonder whether it actually costs governments *more* not to cover these things, because they're largely preventative. People who don't have access to medication or appropriate psych care can often end up in medical crisis and admitted to hospital, which is very expensive. To say nothing of the human cost.\n\nAll things considered, though, I'm so glad I've never had to worry about paying for an ER trip, ambulance, or hospital stay. That's not okay.",

The issue is that even *more* urgent cases kept coming up. My grandfather didn\u2019t just have kidney stones, he also had an infection. They told us on the day we got there that he was at risk of going into septic shock. So yeah, they improved the situation by putting him on an antibiotic drip. If this hadn\u2019t been an emergency surgery, they would\u2019ve just sent us home and scheduled it for another time. They didn\u2019t. We were made to stay. Obviously if someone comes in with a gunshot wound that\u2019s more important. \n\nAs for my friend\u2019s grandpa, they actually didn\u2019t know exactly what they were looking for. They had originally assumed he had a stroke and possibly a brain bleed. It\u2019s after the MRI that they realized it was glioblastoma. Either way, it took around two months.\n\nAnd I agree with you that we have a great healthcare system, especially compared to the US. I was only contesting your claim about waits. This isn\u2019t the only time I\u2019ve experienced it either. I\u2019m not suggesting changing the system. I like it. What we need is more funding to improve it. We need more doctors and that\u2019s all politics. We have very limited spots in med schools and then very limited residency spots as well. I know people with perfect GPAs who had to go to school in the states because they couldn\u2019t get in here. I personally don\u2019t mind paying more taxes for all of us to get better healthcare.",

Surgeons by and large will operate until they get the thing done because they only operate certain days of the week and it is a pain to operate on non operative days (never know when you\u2019ll get an OR). But if things run late and nursing/anesthesia numbers dwindle and other more urgent cases need to go, people can get stuck in limbo. COVID has exasperated this because many nurses were paid triple salary for traveling (who could blame them?).",

Surgeons were there everyday but more urgent life-threatening cases kept coming up so my grandpa kept getting bumped back.\n\nBut even before COVID we had a massive shortage of doctors. This isn\u2019t just in hospitals but regular family doctors too. Almost every family physician\u2019s office has a sign on it that says he/she isn\u2019t accepting any more patients. This results in walk-in clinics being many people\u2019s only choice. The walk in clinic near my house opens at 9 am and people usually start lining up an hour beforehand. What makes me sad is that it\u2019s mostly seniors. \n\nThe reason behind the shortage is limited number of med school spots and then residency spots. The government and the medical association are responsible for that. I know way too many people who had to go to med school in America despite having the GPA to be able to get in here, and then coming and trying to get residency to no avail. They end up just leaving and going back to the states and they never come back. \n\nEither way, our system is still far better than the US. I wouldn\u2019t even mind paying a bit more in taxes so we can improve it. I just don\u2019t like how some people pretend things are perfect here.",

Sadly if an American patient presents with the same symptoms the hospital is still going to clear their procedure with their insurer before starting it and if it's not urgent you won't be getting it same day. Not a chance. Anywhere. They'll want to do more tests and watch your ekg. More they know the better. If it's urgent under Universal Healthcare it happens and there is no insurer to verify coverage first.

Oh it was? Weird.\n\n\"Shouldice was one of a handful of private hospitals grandfathered under the health-care system framework when the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) was introduced in the early 1970s.\"\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/world/rand-paul-hernia-canada-shouldice-1.4978260\n\nFor the Americans in the room wondering, what does that mean?\n\nIt means it's not just world renowned for hernia surgeries but also a FOR-PROFIT hospital.\n\n\"The 1973 law outlawed for-profit hospitals, but it exempted facilities that already existed. Seven private hospitals, including the Shouldice, still operate in the province and all but one get nearly all their revenue from contracts with the public-health system.\"\n\nAre there any other positives to this hospital vs a not for profit though ?\n\n\"Centric, however, is obviously betting that there is a growing market for private-care delivery \u2013 that patients are getting more demanding about quality and timeliness.\"\n\nhttps://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/private-public-debate-erupts-anew-over-sale-of-shouldice-hospital/article4550469/\n\nHuh. It seems that people go there because of issues with quality of care and delays in care with the regular not for profit medical treatments they receive.\n\nAt least it's a good deal right? And it certainly must be cheaper than Americans pay right?\n\n\"Across the income spectrum, the amount Canadian families pay for health care varies widely. For example, the 10 per cent of families with the lowest incomes will pay $471 for health care in 2020, while families among the top 10 per cent of income earners will pay $39,731.\"\n\nhttps://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2020/08/20/2081133/0/en/Fraser-Institute-News-Release-Annual-health-care-costs-for-typical-Canadian-family-may-eclipse-14-000-this-year.html\n\nSo it's safe to assume that the top 10% of income earners must be a small group of people and they must make a huge salary right?\n\nWell, it's actually 2,776,955 people paying that top 10% bracket.\n\nHow much money do they make to have to pay that much?\n\n$96,000 CAD the equivalent of $77,052 USD.\n\nhttps://themeasureofaplan.com/high-income-canadians/\n\nSo roughly just under half of annual your income goes to healthcare.\n\nThis doesn't sound like a better system and it sure doesn't sound cheaper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTl;dr\n\nRand Paul went to a for profit hospital in Canada that specialized in non-mesh hernia care.\n\nIf you make the equivalent of $77,052 USD in Canada you pay the equivalent of $31,878 USD yearly for healthcare.\n\nJust under 50% of your income.",

We own and operate clinics and pharmacies across Canada and the US because we're switching to marijuana centric clinics and have grow facilities on both sides of the border. \nWhat you forgot to mention about Canada's \"private clinics\" is that they are required to see at least 50% of their patients through the public system and get audited to ensure that each year. The main reason why the Canadian Health Act didn't close off \"private clinics\" was because it would limit canadian doctors from being able to do charity work from other countries and help the hundreds of thousands of Americans who head into Canada for medical care each year. \nYou've clearly got less than the basic understanding of how universal Healthcare works. I'm not willing to waste much of my time breaking it down for someone dumb enough to think that a Canadian who making 77k a year pays 31k in Healthcare costs. The right wing study you quote literally says a family of 4 making 142k will have 14k worth of their taxes going towards medical care. Dumbass. And that's it. There's no other costs other than prescription drugs at 10% of what Americans pay. No premiums. No lifetime limits. No networks. No worries about pre-existing conditions or being tied to employment.",

Their clinic is not open to the public and is then private. \nThese \"private clinics\" in Canada you keep talking about are nothing like the clinics in the US. They're required to see at least half their patients through the public system. Most of the physicians in them have hospital privileges so they split time between surgeries at their home clinic and a hospital. They're only allowed to be paid the agreed amount negotiated by the province. An American doctor can charge whatever we want. Usually we set billing rates based on what an insurer will cover and attach our clinic to a network. A Canadian clinic bills the province. You cannot pay to move up in line in Canada. Ever. Under any circumstance. In the US patients can. You think canadian \"leaders\" who make 100k a year and can't accept these massive political contributions like American policians do, are heading to the US and getting massive medical bills for something they could get at home for free?

I wonder how many people have to wait because their insurance tells them \u201cwe have to check & see if we cover that\u201d then have to choose if they\u2019ll risk the medical issue getting worse or even death after they get denied or their insurance won\u2019t cover enough of the costs. \n\nI had got a cavity filling a few years back cause I was in pain and after the filling I was still in horrible pain and it kept getting worse. My dentist wanted me to get a root canal cause it was to the point of almost vomiting & I was taking migraine pills almost every day for nearly a week straight. I called my dental insurance to see if they\u2019d cover it, they told me \u201cNot yet but if you wait until the new year we start covering it then\u201d I had to wait cause A) the procedure would\u2019ve cost almost $2000, and B) luckily this happened like the a few days after Christmas so I only didn\u2019t have to wait long. THEN after I waited for my insurance to cover it, I went back to the dentist & they said \u201coh it\u2019ll take to long for them to process it and we don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll even cover it, just get the procedure now\u201d. Luckily I went to another dentist that found out I didn\u2019t need a root canal just my wisdom tooth pulled and my insurance covered that instantly. \n\nTLDR: My insurance & Western Dental had me wait almost a week suffering from debilitating migraines to the point of almost vomiting to cover an expensive root canal I didn\u2019t need & didn\u2019t get, cause all a second dentist office needed to do was pull one of my Wisdom Teeth. But yeah tell me how bad other countries are for giving every universal healthcare and making it so more people can go to the hospital without having to pay insane prices or worry about if their insurance will cover it.",

Most of the complaints I have heard of are from people who don't know where to go when they think they need medical care (ie. haven't had a bm for five days...better go to emergency) and for people who are waiting for surgeries that are required largely because they haven't taken care of themselves and continue not to and thus are delayed because well, the surgery is a waste of time when you will revert it quickly. I await the downvotes and I'm sure there are other experiences that are justifiably negative ( but these have been my experiences). Also, for those complaining about not having a GP ..... get a Nurse Practitioner. Too many people think they need a GP/MD to look in their ear, check their tongue and grab their nuts but Nurse Practitioners are excellent, can prescribe mediations and get you admitted to specialists. GP's only really need to be in remote places IMHLO. (L is for Lay).",

Keep in mind they back both parties heavily.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/06/27/884307565/after-pushing-lies-former-cigna-executive-praises-canadas-health-care-system\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/08/06/health-insurance-canada-lie/\n\nhttps://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.5631285/this-former-u-s-health-insurance-exec-says-he-lied-to-americans-about-canadian-health-care-1.5631874\n\n> What were the lies you told Americans about Canada's public health-care system?\n> \n> We told the Americans that the Canadian system was not the system that we should have anything to do with, that it was \"socialized medicine.\" We used that term repeatedly to try to get people to be afraid of the Canadian system.\n> \n> We exaggerated and misinformed people about waits. I'm very familiar with the waits that you have to, in many cases, have in Canada for elective procedures. But we wanted people to have the impression that if you have an emergency or if you have any need for medical care, that you were put on a long waiting list.\n> \n> And it's to try to make people think that Canadians don't like their health-care system and that doctors don't like it and that people are coming across the border in droves to get care in the U.S. So we tried to create that perception and to make people think that's really the way the Canadian system is.\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/11/06/931990578/why-americans-have-been-deceived-about-canadas-health-care-system",

Most doctors are really unskilled (think the chefs on Hell's Kitchen, who are *supposed* to be professionals). Most competent doctors go to the US.

Universal healthcare is worthless if the healthcare you get is of low quality (North Korea has free healthcare for all but I doubt the doctors can do anything if you have cancer or an annoying tumor somewhere hard to operate on). One strength of the current US healthcare system is the skill of doctors and the advanced medical breakthroughs they have available. Care should be taken to not lose this.",

Actually listen to the logistical stuff instead of being \u201cmoved\u201d by sob stories? Cmon i know you guys can do better. \n\nThe US is this corrupt amalgamation of private and federal healthcare. Y\u2019all ever notice how theres a bazillion scams out there that specifically target people on medicare and medicaid? And my sister has lived off of medicaid her entire life, not once ever working a day in her life\u2026 because shes considered disabled because she has bipolar disorder. Dont ask me okay\u2026 alls I can tell you is that and she lives in California. \n\nI am certainly not going to sit here and tel you our healthcare system is top notch, nothing needs to be changed. Quite the opposite really\u2026 i dont know a single person alive\u2026 conservative or progressive\u2026 that loves our healthcare system. EVERYONE hates it. Liberals hate it because its not \u201cfree\u201d enough and conservatives hate it because its too free and is subject to a LOT of corruption. And guess what guys? Both are right. Its corrupt af, the politicians are making the most money from the healthcare industry and pharmaceuticals\u2026 the highest paid federal employee right now is faucci\u2026 which btw he, nanci pelosi, and the cuomos actually legitimately do have ties to the mafia so\u2026 um yeah\u2026 no its not just cuz \u201cIm RaCiSt\u2026\u201d cuz they got Italian sounding names, no\u2026 its definitely a thing. They definitely are. \n\nBut y\u2019all hate people who have more than enough fucking with the system for their own capitalist gain right??? Well why don\u2019t you look at the people you are allying with??? Why don\u2019t you scrutinize the people who are the wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing in your flock! I used to be democrat\u2026 until i realized how stupid democrats really were to being voluntarily blind to these things\u2026 im tellin ya the modern republican is a former democrat and their values never changed. They still care about the planet, and healthcare, and people and all that shit\u2026 they just finally woke up and realized theyve been LIED to all their lives. \n\nUniversal healthcare would be splendid, if government programs *ever* worked in the first place! They dont! You know this! The problem is not the idea, the problem is the power you give to those who have no accountability\u2026 our system is fucked because progressive programs fucked them. How many times have you seen an old hospital bill or old tuition bill online and was shocked and how cheap everything used to be? Well honey that was BEFORE the federal programs. Those programs made healthcare and schooling LESS accessible\u2026 not more! And stop saying well its just because the wrong people blah blah blah\u2026 yeah\u2026 its ALWAYS the wrong people. Thats the freakin point. You will never have the right people. \n\nTake AWAY power! Stop giving it blindly! And you will get what you are asking for!",

When she was alive, they gave her the treatment in exchange for research data while she was alive and her corpse after she died. Once she died and they had her body and the body didn't give them any meaningful data (I'm assuming, since they cremated and returned her within a month) then they suddenly wanted hundreds of thousands of dollars from me, her next of kin. I told them that I didn't have any money, since I quit my job and moved to care for her, and to send it to collections. Never heard from them again about the bills, but they do ask *constantly* if I would like to donate to their continued research. Fuck off, you fucking ghouls.",

                      "text": "Most people don\u2019t do in depth research on topics and don\u2019t think for themselves before forming an opinion. They wait to be told what to believe and follow that view in sort of a \u201cherd belief\u201d system. If other people back your opinion through propaganda then they\u2019re more enticed to believe it. \n\nIn reality, specially when it comes to politics people don\u2019t do in depth research, no one looks into Bernie\u2019s universal healthcare proposal on paper, they hear about it in his 30 seconds of allotted time to talk about it, wait to listen to what opposition says about it and believe that cause that\u2019s who they trust more, that\u2019s who they see more on tv with a smiling face. \n\nPoliticians then abuse that trust by telling lies/twisting truth for financial compensation and brainwash millions of followers into that narrative which works best for your shadow corporation backers. \n\nIt\u2019s to the point now where there has been enough propaganda to where most people only believe left or only believe right. Any outside opposition don\u2019t stand a chance because they don\u2019t get the viewership, they don\u2019t get publicity, they don\u2019t get millions of cash incentive to fund campaigns for bribes. They rely solely on educated people reading, understanding and backing their viewpoints. And I\u2019m not talking uneducated in dumb. I mean uneducated in where they don\u2019t look into the actual proposals or anything just just have surface level knowledge from ear to ear or through propaganda\n\nThen there is the backers. Left and right both are backed by corporations with agendas to fill. Suddenly your party is not caring 100% for the peoples welfare but now they need to keep corporations in mind. This leads to the majority parties caring less about humanitarian measures and more about business measures. If you stop supporting your company, they will stop backing you and start backing opposition. So you get forced into peer pressure to do what they want. Even if you wanna do something for people it may not fit the agenda so you can\u2019t do it. \n\nThen there comes conflict of companies. This company wants one thing this company wants the complete opposite. What happens is we get switched from left to right or right to left and they go and completely reverse the changes the previous party did to support their own corporations. Now these two parties are in a tug of war where they try to pass something but it gets rejected by the other party and now literally nothing is getting done.\nThey are now too focused on untangling this net of back and forth between parties, and measures for the benefit of the people come second to that of corporations. \n\nAnd now surprise! Nothing is getting done. Any changes get reverted, and proposals get knocked down, and the parties become less humane over time. not by any fault of their own, but from a long history of corporate promises and backing which prevents you from making any actual change for the better.\n\nYou\u2019d think that eventually people will come to the conclusion that either side doesn\u2019t have your best interest and go with a third party but that\u2019s not what happens. All the hate they have gets directed at the electee instead of the party itself. Then they just recycle their electee. \u201cOh that persons not running for president this year, we have this fresh new face who is coming in to make big changes for our party\u201d spoiler alert, the fresh face is just a way to get you to forget about the horrible things their other candidate did and this new fresh face will do the exact same thing, absorb all the hate pass what the party wants to pass then get recycled for a new face. Your still voting left or still voting right, just under a new name and nothing gets changed",

First responders were amazed I didn\u2019t die or pass out as the car was unrecognizeable. (Praise Hyundai Elantra engineering.) Went to hospital, was seen within 30 mins at 11:30pm at night. Diagnosed with minor concussion, some bruising, no internal injuries. They did a full check on me for crash trauma.  I even had an expired health card due to my laziness to renew it. Didn\u2019t get charged a single cent for a 4 hour visit.\n\n\nBiggest cost was the $40 CAD parking to my gf who came to visit me right away and sat with me in emergency while I was waiting to be seen. And oh, $3 for the crappy Tim Hortons coffee and a donut.\n\nGrrrr, if you wanna know what\u2019s truly evil is how Tim Hortons has exclusive rights to have onsite food service at hospitals in my province.

Over the next 4 1/2 years, I had surgeries to remove screws from my legs and at one point have them break my right leg again due to a non-union heal. \n\nIf I wasn't 25 at the time and on my dad's extremely good insurance, then I would have been screwed.\n\nToday, you probably never would have guessed I was hit by a car. I came out of it pretty good for what it is worth. Honestly, the only thing I get now, is people thinking I have a tear drop tattoo. This is due to scarring just under my eye that looks like a tear drop from a distance. It's a good ice breaker when meeting new people.",

I also kept the rods after I got them removed about 3 years ago, because they are cool.\n\n As soon as I got out of the ICU they had me learning to walk again. After 5 weeks I was going back to work because I didn't want to lose my job, which I loved *(I was a contractor about to become a full time employee when I was hit on a Friday and was supposed to sign papers on Monday).* I would drive to work with my wheel chair in my passenger seat and walk around my truck when I got there. Then pull the wheel chair out and wheel up to the door. I still work for them now, about 10 years later.\n\nOther than that, the later surgeries were easy. I would go to outpatient and literally walk out an hour or so later. I even walked out when they broke my leg due to the nonunion. I had pain if I did physical activities, or stood for too long, but looking back on it, it wasn't so bad in the long run. Also stairs are the worst invention in the world. I hated stairs sooo much.",

Even if you do make it there on a H1B visa you will live in constant fear of being able to be fired and deported at a drop of a hat while you sit in the 10+ year queue for residency and the companies know this so they abuse the fuck out of migrants and drag their feet to help sponsor them for their residency.\n\nSo glad I never moved there.",

But the system here makes that an impossible situation unfortunately. I'd be thrilled to pay taxes into a system and contribute to a society where I am not basically forced into poverty because of a system that is not designed to do anything but make money for rich people. \n\nI know it's important to balance things, but just because a person is disabled doesn't mean they don't have a way to add value to a society.

Until recently I'd say that Canada is one of those countries, and in a lot of ways it is, but now I'm realizing they've got their own crazies, they just have less power than the crazies here in the USA. New Zealand as well maybe? Scotland? Scotland's not a country but I feel like I can no longer say the UK isn't run by nut jobs. But at least Scotland seems to mostly have its act together.\n\nI'm obviously biased towards thinking of English-speaking countries but I think those just reflect ones I've spent time in and liked, so it's more correlated with my travels. I'm curious what other countries people would put in this category. I love Amsterdam as well and could totally see myself living there, if only my industry had more of a presence there.",

I always loved solving problems, so much that I did LSAT logic problems for fun in highschool lol. But that's not something that every child is taught at home and critical thinking skills are actually something the GOP is against in regards to school curriculum. They don't want children to be able to analyze and breakdown problems and find solutions because it makes children question authority. So now we have a whole lot of students who don't have the skills needed to get a better perspective on things and the cycle goes on....",

It is based in logic and does not peddle in fallacies. \n\nCrash Course has a great philosophy Playlist to use as a jumping off point.\n\nBy learning the structure of a logical argument you can formulate your own. Then you just need an interlocutor to help expand your perception and provide counter arguments. Don't be afraid to argue against your own beliefs either, it can shed some light on issues with your own arguments as well as leave you open to changing your mind (which is critical to the process of learning). \n\nOnce you have some practice with this you can start reading articles and start pointing out flaws in the articles arguments (all journalism at this point is thinly veiled persuasive arguments, which is why finding unbiased news sources is near impossible). When you come across an article that praises Joe Biden, find another article that criticizes him. And analyze the articles *together*. And do the reverse as well.\n\nSome rules I use to do this that may help you as well:\n\n1. Problems and policies are complex, if you don't have all of the information, you cannot be fully informed. Always dig deeper and read original sources where able. (Read the bill)\n\n2. No one is immune to propaganda, always be on the lookout for people who actively try to mold your beliefs and look for proof that back up claims.\n\n3. Find an in person interlocutor, online interlocutors cannot be held accountable for bad arguments\n\n4. Avoid logical fallacy like the plague\n\n5. When debating with someone, address a premise or conclusion fully before moving to a new premise or conclusion. This kills the ability to move goal posts, perform whataboutisms, and sea lioning.\n\n6. Celebrate when you are proven wrong, losing a position, belief, or even a piece of your identity can feel like someone dear to you has died. Start rewarding yourself when this happens to help condition your brain to accept and look forward to learning opportunities. Order a round of drinks for you and your interlocutor,  eat a piece of chocolate, smile.\n\n7. Find a good therapist if possible who understands philosophy,  they can be invaluable help in learning how to separate feelings from fact.\n\nIn a world where misinformation is held up the same as real info, the only filter is you. Learn how to do it well and you will find out you are bettering yourself along the way.\n\n** How to help others avoid being victim to misinformation **\n\nTeach them the skills above through reasonable, logical discourse. But don't do it by talking politics!\nThere are many non-political philosophical debate subjects out there.\n\nTeach them the foundational knowledge required to critically think.\n\nAt some point they may have a break through when they start using these skills on political or religious content, *be there for them.* Shower them with praise, caring and affection. Many people that think inline with things like QAnon, first got there because they were not getting these things elsewhere. Check out The Alt Right Playbook  for details.\n\nNot everyone is savable, but if every member of this sub helps one other person. Than there will be nearly 6,000,000 more people who are less likely to be fooled.",

We thought that surely our system has many smart and talented people in it that would do what is best for the nation before party.  \n\nWe underestimated the fear and anger of movements like the Tea Partiers of the early 00s.  All it took was a political strategist to capitalize on that and convince an apolitical grifter who switched party affiliation based on personal gain to cater to them and their fears.  They also saw how they could use social media to evangelize and motivate followers like no political campaign had ever before.  They also took immediate charge of their narrative by branding all media not in their team as liars and enemies of the state.  I think they surprised even themselves with how well it worked.\n\nCombine that with Russian hacking and ratfucking, and you had a narrative that drowned out anything negative like his bankruptcies and lawsuits no matter how factual.",

Of course no one has any trust in the government or shared sense of community. Combine that with laissez-faire capitalism coming full circle with social media prioritizing their profits over any sense of common good (imagine that), and we had the perfect storm for the country falling apart. The thing to note, imo, is that this could not have really gone any other way. We build a society based on individualism, put personal freedom as the most virtuous ideal, pander only to corporations over individuals, and have our government lie and spy on us, and we end up in a terrible society.

My parents both came from rural backgrounds. Mom grew up on a dairy farm and her parents were lifelong Democrats. My dad is the son of a shop teacher and school principal who still talks about how much he loved JFK. But politics wasn\u2019t something we talked about much growing up. Jesus was. Our approach to faith was always about serving God and trying to be good people. My parents never really talked about applying Christianity to political issues. They were separate things. For example, my mom is pro-life, but she doesn\u2019t think abortion should be illegal. So as a result of this upbringing, me, my brothers, and my parents are pretty moderate, and anti-Trump. So I didn\u2019t have family pushing me into any political ideology, and for that I\u2019m thankful.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not a special case. My hometown friends that i talk to every day are very similar to me in that regard. I think what it really comes down to is how your immediate family treats politics, and whether or not you\u2019re allowed to think critically. I work in news, I try to stay informed, and I minored in political science. If you can think critically about your beliefs and let yourself see issues from other people\u2019s perspectives, you\u2019re more likely to at least have informed opinions instead of parroting the same buzzwords and talking points as everyone else. And some people don\u2019t want to do that. \n\nSorry if that was kind of all over the place. I\u2019m a film maker, not a sociologist.",

The conveniences of living in town are gonna be nice, but I will miss the country.\n\nAs far as being ostracized, it\u2019s gonna depend on the region. I live in the buckle of the Bible Belt, where Christianity is basically the norm, but that doesn\u2019t mean people of other religions or no religion at all are going to be shunned by everyone. And if you\u2019re up north or out west, I imagine the culture is a little different, even out in the country.\n\nAs far as schools, I can\u2019t really speak to that because I don\u2019t have kids. I went to a really small country school. We were K-12 with graduating class of 85 people. But we were in one of the more affluent counties in our state.",

In 1609, English ships bought slaves from Africa and brought them to plantations such as Jamestown in British America.  Plantation work was labor intensive.\n\nThe Pilgrims/Puritans started arriving in 1620 and they were the oddballs.  Commerce was not their primary venture.  They preached piety, but got really sadistic (public punishments, persecution of Quakers, hanging of witches).  Initially they were happy to stay in their private hell near Plymouth.\n\nThings got really busy with the Massachusetts Bay Company, a British commercial venture in which land owners paid the ship passage of poor souls wanting a better life.  They were indentured servants and served about 7 years before they were made Freemen.  They created New England.\n\nSlavery in  British America had been going for well over 150 years before we finally formed our own country.  To our shame, we let slavery flourish for another 100 years before abolition.\n\nSo the water is murky if you to try make comparisons between the UK and US.  We are quite intertwined.",

If we want true, lasting, fundamental change, it's going to require some of those people you identify as Nazis.\n\nBeing ignorant of the nature of (or IMO flaws within) our current system of government is, from my point of view, just as head in the sand. It's not centrism, I am in no way not liberal in my beliefs. Unless we now think it's okay for us to also just blindly operate off of fear and anger, simply because it makes feel a bit more comfortable with our deep frustration.\n\nI'm not saying we need to sacrifice values, but one of those values, to me, has always been a pride in kind of \"being informed\" let's say. The shitty reality is that without an outright revolution, we will not accomplish anything worthwhile on a national scale without the ability to form a coalition with people that you would identify as \"Nazis\", only because I am assuming you are a bit liberal with that usage. The deck is stacked against us in that regard. It is far, far easier to enact obstruction than progression in the US. Period.",

It is also why our constitution _explicitly_ states that any powers not expressly given to the federal government are given to the states. Which is why you see such huge differences between states as they pursued their own interests; it's also why \"expansion of government\" is such a big deal to so many people. The original idea was not to have a strong, centralized government.\n\nThe articles of confederation failed because it would not have provided a strong enough central government to actually keep the states together, primarily through the ability to collect taxes. No taxes = no money = no state.",

That thinking trains us to be selfish and look out for only ourselves. We could use a hardy helping of egalitarianism in my opinion.\n\nYes, we idolize the rich and famous. But the biggest lie that we tell people is that everyone can succeed if you work hard enough. That's where the problem lies. Poor? Not successful? Drug Problems? It's because you're lazy. \n\nWant to know why some people brag about their 80-100 hour work weeks? It's because they think they \"figured life out.\" They \"figured out\" the right amount of work to get out of living paycheck to paycheck. They can start saving. They can start affording things (houses, cars, vacations, etc.).   \n\nSo when these people, who have life figured out, see poor or less fortunate people, the \"solution\" is obvious to them....Just work harder. That's what they did. Why should they help someone who is poor/lazy? They are just going to keep being poor/lazy. \n\nThe idea that helping everyone...helps everyone...it doesn't compute.",

Yet it's a win win because it's not just me working on myself, it's helping those who aren't as fortunate as myself to be born to a middle class family in a developed country\n\nImo, if everyone spared a good few hours a week to charity, it would solve so many of our world's problems, hunger, poverty, plastic pollution, because a lot of people have the capability to take a few hours out of their week for charity work. Added all up, so much good could be done, and at the same time, the volunteers themselves gain experience and stuff they can say on their resume and job interviews",

It's one of the few things soldiers are taught to NOT cover each other over, that and SHARP. 3) The Geneva Convention actually hinders the US capability to pursue interests. One of the few things Trump said that was actually true is that the Geneva Convention actually puts our soldiers in more harm than it is worth to follow it given the US would never acknowledge the Hagues authority to hold the government or a soldier acocuntable for its violations (though we do a fairly solid job in holding ourselves accountable). 4) You have no idea to what ends the Geneva Convention is used, since you don't even know when it was made or what it entails.",

NOTHING to do with war crimes, as a matter of fact the pre-1949 Geneva conventions didn't even define torturing or denying prisoners of war as a crime. All it did was encourage they be treated humanely. Technically under the pre-1949 Geneva convention the Nazi party was not guilty of war crimes. The Nazi party was one of the few examples in human history where people were retroactively affected by new laws created. The reason they got away with doing so was because of how horrific the crimes of WW2 were. And the only war crime they can be charged with is genocide or the assistance of it. \n\nKeep telling me you don't know shit without telling me you don't know shit.",

So they made this list, think it\u2019s called a charge master, and raised the price of everything, by like a fuck ton. Then they could show it to insurance companies, and discount it by like 50%, so now the insurance companies thought they were getting a deal. Anyone without insurance however has to pay full price. Every hospital has one of these lists, and the prices are obscene.",

              "text": "Some time ago, there was a city in the US (Colorado Springs) that wasn't doing so good economically. The city had two options: raises  property taxes or cut expenses. The citizens voted for no tax increase, and things went downhill from there, but there's one part that really stuck with me: they turned the streetlights off, and the people would rather pay more to live in darkness (or at least partial darkness) than pay a tax to turn the lights back on.\n\n\n> **Robert Smith**\n> The residents of Colorado Springs should've seen it coming. When the recession hit, the city gave everyone fair warning. Here are the things we have to cut-- police, fire, those beautiful parks all over Colorado Springs. All of this could be gone, the city said, if you don't vote to raise your taxes.\n> \n> **Bo Sharifi**\n> I don't think I took it very seriously.\n> \n> **Robert Smith**\n> This is Bo Sharifi. He and his wife Sara and their two kids live up in the foothills of Colorado Springs.\n> \n> **Bo Sharifi**\n> As soon as I hear government, oh, we need more money, I don't know. I guess I kind of automatically assume, yeah, there's probably some other things you could probably cut before firemen, policemen, city lights, and that sort of thing.\n> \n> **Robert Smith**\n> So when his street light went dark, he didn't put two and two together.\n> \n> **Bo Sharifi**\n> Being the Good Samaritan, I called the city. And I was like, \"Hey, you need to come out and fix this light.\" They're like, \"Oh, yeah. You remember that tax increase you didn't vote for?\" I was like, \"Uh, maybe.\"\n> \n> **Robert Smith**\n> The guy on the phone explained to Bo how life was going to be in Colorado Springs from now on. If you want your street light, he said, you have to pay for it. For $125, the city would send someone to Bo's street and turn back on the electricity. $125. You could pay by credit card. For Bo and his wife Sarah, it was hard to believe at first. It seemed like some kind of scam, some kind of payback from the city.\n> \n> **Sara Sharifi**\n> Because it felt like, in a way, by shoveling out $100 to turn on a street light that we kind of felt was supposed to be on anyway, that it was giving them what they wanted.\n> \n> **Robert Smith**\n> Giving who what they wanted?\n> \n> **Sara Sharifi**\n> The city. I think people were just kind of ticked.\n> \n> **Robert Smith**\n> The Sharifis and their neighbors said fine. We will pay for lights ourselves. And hundreds of other people around the city did the exact same thing. Colorado Springs became an unusual place, a city where the people who could afford streetlights paid for them, a la carte. Others lived in the dark. It was like the capital of some very snowy, unusually affluent third world country.\n> \n> You could see it driving around. Colorado Springs was stepping away from one of the things that we take for granted in most American cities, that we're all in it together. At least when it comes to basic services.\n\n--\n\n> What I learned, though, from talking to the people in Colorado Springs is that for a lot of them these calculations don't really matter. They don't care if privatizing actually saves the government money, so long as the government is doing less.\n> \n> City councilwoman Jan Martin says she hears this all the time. That it's become a matter of faith in the city that private is better. And she tells us a story. In the dark days, after the tax measure was defeated, city council was having another meeting about slashing government.\n> \n> > **Jan Martin**\n> > And a gentleman came up to me and actually thanked me for the adopt a street light program. He had just written a check to the city for $300 to turn all the street lights back on in his neighborhood. And I did remind him that for $200 if he had supported the tax initiative, we could have had not only streetlights, but parks and firemen and swimming pools and community centers. That by combining our resources, we as a community can actually accomplish more than we as individuals.\n> > \n> > **Robert Smith**\n> > And he said?\n> > \n> > **Jan Martin**\n> > He said he would never support a tax increase.\n> > \n> > **Robert Smith**\n> > So for him it wasn't the money. He was willing to pay more to turn on the street lights than to pay for all city services.\n> > \n> > **Jan Martin**\n> > That's right. And it's because of a total lack in trust of local government to spend those services, which was part of Steve Bartolin's letter. That prevailing sense that government won't take care of our money, that brings somebody to the conclusion that, I'll take care of mine. You go figure out how to take care of yours, because we don't trust government to do it for us.\n\nthisamericanlife.org/459/transcript",

I'd happily pay x amount in taxes for healthcare for all instead of relying on my healthcare plan. I'm already wasting a percentage of each paycheck every month on health care I'm not using.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm American.\n\nI just checked the numbers. I'd only be paying an extra $75 a month in taxes if we had free healthcare over what I pay now (using the aforementioned 10%). These people don't get it. You don't need to worry about bullshit copay fees or prescription fees, so you're actually saving money when you do need to utilize the healthcare system.",

My dad sawed off half of his fingers, and he had to get them amputated... well, my city has no plastics area.  So we fly to Winnipeg, and are told that we better get there early because it's walk-in and first come first serve at the clinic.  He sees a doctor who realized that he can actually fuse one joint rather than amputate that finger so he at least saves the finger, but now that requires an OR.  \n\nWell we were on standby for the OR...\n\nHe couldn't stay in the hospital because he wasn't critical, but he couldn't go home so he was on standby... so he just had to stay in a nearby hotel.   Keep in mind three of his fingers are still cut off and he hasn't had stitches or anything yet, just a massive ball of gauze on his hand AND he had to fast every day from morning until 5 pm in case they called for a surgery. \n\nHe was waiting in that hotel for 3 weeks by himself .... His bandages were changed once like 2 days before the surgery.   The cost of that hotel was 1000's because it wasn't covered by insurance (yes we still have insurance for some things). \n\nWe only live like a 7 hour drive away, I told them: \"Hey, if you give us 8 hours notice, I can literally drop everything and drive there and make it to the surgery so he's at least at home with someone to help him out while he's waiting\"... but nope.  Had to wait by himself, with unstitched severed fingers only eating one meal a day for 3 weeks. My mom was bitching the helpline/patient advocate thing at the hospital too...  it wasn't until we had time to drive back Easter weekend and complain in person that he \"magically\" got in the next day and was able to go home. \n\nThat situation doesn't happen when you have the person actually paying the bills advocating.  The hospital doesn't give a shit because they get their money anyway and charge it all to the government. \n\nNow I'm not saying it's universally bad either... \n\nI just hate people who think it's like the gold standard when there's many counties that do healthcare much better than us, or the US, in both socialized AND private scenarios.",

And the provider will have to be in your insurer's network or coverage will be denied.  In fact the insurance company will search long and hard for any possible reason to deny coverage as is the experience of many insured Americans.\n\nIt is altogether possible that your dad's experience would have been better under a private system, but it is also possible that it could have been just as bad or worse.    Canadians who have experienced US healthcare (like myself) even with superb insurance take a look at how different the experience is in Canada and yes, swell with pride at how much better it is for the end users.  No Canadian permanent resident or citizen is denied coverage in Canada period.  Sometimes the service may suck, but at least it is paid for, no questions asked.",

Where does the extra $6000 go? \n\nWell, a small chunk (10%?) is profits for health insurance companies. A huge chunk is basically bureaucracy.   Aetna pays 80% of premiums collected for health care and the other 20% is profits and administration costs.  Medicare pays 97% and has 3% admin.  Plus the health insurance companies are such a mess that doctors and hospitals pay a criminal amount of money on medical billing, aka getting insurance companies to agree that yes, their customer is allowed to get lifesaving surgery and removing a brain tumor isn't cosmetic.  Had a heath insurance company tell me therapy for suicidal depression was unnecessary care and not covered under their mental health coverage.\n\nThen you have the costs of the US having universal emergency care.  If you don't pay for folks to get preventative care, and don't pay for treatment until it is an emergency, you will pay a lot more for emergency surgery than you would have for a course of antibiotics.  Most of those people don't have insurance so the costs are passed on to the people who do have insurance.",

Shutting down all of the private insurance groups, and/or absorbing them into a government program, will be a huge disruption that nobody wants to actually take on except for the more left leaning politicians who get blocked out by the media and other politicians. The lobbyists, and politicians they pay, currently have this propaganda and government battle locked down. If the pandemic couldn't shake them, it's going to take something huge to get them to crack.",

What might be more important is the fact that most of us are forced medical indentured service and that's \"good for business\"; you can't just quit a job with insurance.  I spent a couple months between jobs this year (I accepted an offer across the country but there was a lot of stuff to sort out before moving).   Based on my old income (which was sub 6 figures), I would have paid 3k per month on the ACA market place (more than half of my monthly income at that point) and COBRA was not much better.  Ultimately, I decided to not have insurance for a couple of months which was a tough call because my wife and daughter were on the policy as well.  At least in that case it was a set period of time and COBRA can technically be activated retroactively.  But what if I just wanted to quit a job and take a couple of months to find another one, take some classes, relax, etc?  No matter how much money I have, that's not an option.   One good injury will put us in the poor house.  If healthcare is tied to taxes, that would not be a problem.  But, you're right, there's probably a worry about productivity loss.  And/or the idiotic notion that we'd become an entitlement society (thanks, Joe Manchin).",

But for Medicare if you earn $0-$18,000 you pay nothing (and qualify for a healthcare card which makes doctors visits free). $18,000-$90,000 you pay 2% so I earned just under $40,000 last year and paid just shy of $800 in taxes toward healthcare. $90,000-$150,000 you pay 3% and $150,000+ you pay 4%. Brackets may have shifted slightly since I last looked. \n\nMedicare does not cover dental, optical or ambulance. Ambulance schemes are done differently state to state but in my state you pay an ambulance membership per year for \u2018free\u2019 ambulance service. I don\u2019t remember how much it costs. I think the biggest family plan is like $80 per year. I think I pay like 30 something for myself. \n\nFrom my experience in the hospital system (my dad was in and out for years) mostly everything is free, he would occasionally leave with a bill for medication which was around 20 bucks. \n\nMy dad did have private health insurance and one point, the only difference really was a private room instead of like a ward of 4 beds.\n\nEDIT: We also pay for the doctor, it can be bulk build which leaves no out of pocket expense or you can be charged. Depends on the reason for visit and stuff like that. If you get charged it can be $70-$80 out of pocket then Medicare will reimburse you some of the cost, usually around $35.",

It doesn't matter whatsoever that a private system theoretically can be more \"efficient\" (translation: pay less to a larger part of the workers), most of the money will be funneled to people who spend them on yachts in any case, and the total cost is larger. It's always larger, because it's for-profit.\n\nCan everything be controlled by the state, and do most people want that? No, of course not, but nobody is fucking suggesting that. Infrastructure, health, a proper safety net, all of these things are done better by the state, and we know that because we've had these systems in place for literally hundreds of years \u2013 even Adam Smith said he didn't think the market could tackle important societal structures like health care (seriously, read The Wealth of Nations.)\n\nWe're so far down the capitalistic path that the laissez faire of the 1800s are starting to look good.

This is so my co-worker who has diabetes and the same premium as me can get (albeit shitty) coverage. This is why the system needs young, healthy people in it but too many opt out. That wouldn't be a problem if it is tax funded since everyone (in theory) with a pay check would be paying in. This would also save SO much money for businesses as well since they won't need to contribute to the premiums.\n\nSo, the argument that we would pay for everyone else's Illness is absurd.

The Pfizer vaccine is a great example of this. Pricing and payment was done behind closed doors, government made it mandatory, and Pfizer represents the largest portion of most senators individual stock portfolios at the moment. If we go with socialized medicine then it will be a situation where xyz company comes out with a cure for cancer for example, they go to their lackey in Congress and pay them a ton of cash to give the company an exclusive with the socialized medical program, they then can set the price at literally whatever they want because to the end user it is free but to the tax payer it could be a billion dollars a pop for all we have the power to decide. The politicians will be all about it because they will all buy stock then sign the bill and make a killing. Meanwhile our tax spend is now ridiculous even more so and we are just hurting our economy and people more than we are helping but we are blind to it because yay free medicine. It won\u2019t work and it will get worse if we try it in the US but hey I am all about going down that path to say I told you so. Eventually if our economy survives and we don\u2019t just create a thousand more billionaire politicians out of it we will probably reverse it and go along the lines of separation of church and state. Separation of medicine and state because it is something everyone needs so we can\u2019t let them control the costs and line their own pockets.

But people do not separate the 2. sigh   \nAnyway, insurance already makes a lot of decisions about treatment. I cannot for the life of me understand why someone would rather trust a business who makes more money if you do \\*not\\* use the coverage over a government situation where they are convinced there will be \"death panels\".   \nLook mofos, in some areas of the US the pandemic did hit death panel status but that was in deciding who got treatment (generally intubation/ventilation) and I'm sure insurance had a thing or 2 to say about that  as well.   \nAnyway, yeah it's very clear that there is a significant group of \"screw you I've got mine\" people. Then there are the people that are convinced it would be better to make people depend on charity, because of course ONLY the most worthy would get $ that way since each individual decides where to donate their money.

The popular support is there. Those that don't believe in it can fuck off, more than half of Americans want universal healthcare, by a good margin.

In Canada, the wait time is set according to the availability of services in the area and by the relative need of the person needing treatment.\n\n...\n> Robert Bell, the President and CEO of University Health Network, Toronto, said that Michael Moore's film Sicko \"exaggerated the performance of the Canadian health system \u2014 there is no doubt that too many patients still stay in our emergency departments waiting for admission to scarce hospital beds.\" However, \"Canadians spend about 55% of what Americans spend on health care and have longer life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. Many Americans have access to quality healthcare. All Canadians have access to similar care at a considerably lower cost.\" There is \"no question\" that the lower cost has come at the cost of \"restriction of supply with sub-optimal access to services,\" said Bell. A new approach is targeting waiting times, which are reported on public websites.\n\nSeems like wait times haven't negatively impacted people's quality of life, and are the *only* issue left to solve in the Canadian healthcare system. The US healthcare system, on the other hand, has several issues that all trend toward unequal care.",

Three weeks after I started having pain, the pain in my ear suddenly skyrocketed, I heard a ringing in my ear, I was dizzy and nauseous, and my ear was dripping blood. I drove to an urgent care and begged to be seen. The NP took a look at my ear but wouldn\u2019t diagnose me or give me medicine until I could come up with $75 right then and there. I was poor as fuck at the time. Like a couple bucks to my name, digging through the couch for loose change just to find enough money for gas, poor. I had to text a bunch of people begging for a couple bucks before I got enough in my PayPal to give it to the NP before she told me that my infection was so bad it blew my ear drum.

It's like 7 bucks or something stupid. \n\nBut my cousin's baby was born with a heart condition too. I forget the details, I wanna say he was born with a hole in his heart? Either way, he's like 5, and he's been in and out of the hospital his entire life. All free. Hasn't paid a cent. \n\nThere's always all this talk about \"personal responsibility\", and yadda yadda... And I can't help but point to this kid. He was BORN with a hole in his heart. It's not something he chose, it's not a result of his poor lifestyle or anything like that. It's not something his parents chose either... It just happened. Sometimes life just shits on you. \n\nBut because we're Canadian, his parents weren't financially ruined. It hasn't been easy, but medical bills are one less thing they've had to worry about. The way I see it, being sick is enough of a burden. And if a society has the ability to cover this stuff (and America absolutely does, 10000%), it's inhumane and unethical to not do so. Like Spider-Man says, *\"When you can do the things that I can, but you don't and then the bad things happen, they happen because of you\"*\n\nI live in America now and hearing this bullshit drives me insane.

I\u2019d say the vast majority of people are similar in the sense that they form their opinions over what\u2019s in their best interest as some people are negatively affected in terms of outcomes or whether or not they can afford/access it.\n\n2. The healthcare system is overly complicated, people don\u2019t understand it \u2014 but one somewhat straightforward example I\u2019d give on why it\u2019s not really fair to compare the US to other countries is virtually all the innovation in healthcare/drug space comes from the US. Developing drugs is expensive (often in the billions), time consuming (often over a decade), and risky (90% of drugs will not get FDA approval \u2014 and you waste lots of time/money with nothing to show for ur efforts). Why would anybody take on that insane amount of effort and risk to finance the development of a new drug? Easy, with big risks comes big rewards \u2014 you need to be able to pump out cash for those 20 years your patent is good for. In order to pump out cash, you need good margins, which require high prices. Americans foot the bill for this because other countries have different regulations on drug prices. If America adopted these systems, there would be nobody willing to innovate and develop new drugs. So in a way the US is subsidizing most of the world\u2019s healthcare. \n\n3. Im a huge fan of for profit healthcare, which sounds bad at first but it\u2019s not. Back when for profit hospitals came about a few decades ago people went ballistic and protested. It turns out those for profit hospitals delivered better care (in terms of outcomes) at a fraction of the price. One example of this is outpatient. Previously, if you had a gunshot wound/were bleeding out, you would go to the same place as somebody who sprained their ankle. These for profit hospitals realized that was dumb and outpatient was born.\n\nI covered healthcare equities at a bulge bracket.",

Working urgent care, I used to see patients walk away because they couldn't pay even though they had serious complaints like severe chest pain. My paycheck shouldn't be based on how many people get hurt or sick but in a for-profit system, that is the reality of the US healthcare system. \n\n\n2. Pharmaceuticals are simply one part of treatment. The United States is not the only country that develops new drugs. Other countries have other drugs that are not found in the US. Pharmaceutical companies in the US are also willing to push their products on healthcare providers because they profit from every prescription written. See: Purdue Pharma and Oxycotin. Many people became addicted because it was falsely advertised as a non-addictive alternative for pain management. I have seen the ramifications of this first-hand, taking care of elderly patients who have become dependent on these drugs. Developing treatment *methods* is a global effort. Studies on new techniques are done in collaboration between countries. One study is done in one country, another country replicates that study to add to the body of research that everyone around the world benefits from.\n\n\n3. For-profit systems put profit above all else. Good patient outcomes are an obstacle to making profits because making sure a patient gets the best care takes time and time is money. Paying and treating staff properly, giving them benefits, all that costs money. In a for-profit system, those are the things that will get cut. I work 12 hours and am allowed one 30min lunch break. The failures of a for-profit system should have been clear with the pandemic.",

For the record, I think the whole opioid epidemic is pretty messed up \u2014 and I\u2019m not arguing for zero regulation by any means. \n\nALSO this should really get you excited bc for profit healthcare doesn\u2019t mean you need people to get sick in order to make money. Capitated plans (Medicare and Medicare advantage) allow companies like Agilon to partner with doctors and profit off of having patients come in as little as possible. Basically capitated plans have high premiums with low/no deductible or copay. So whether you see the doctor once a year or once a month \u2014 the doctor/agilon is only getting $500 a month. Therefore, in order to maximize the bottom line \u2014 you want to treat people as efficiently as possible so you can take on more patients. \n\nI encourage you to research the introduction of for profit hospitals. If you\u2019re wondering why everyone seems to complain about them, but they\u2019re still around\u2026the answer isn\u2019t corruption, it\u2019s because there have been studies that have shown they produce better outcomes at a lower cost to the patient. It\u2019s a little complicated to explain to the average American\u2026and given the emotional response healthcare causes nobody tries bc ppl usually just get mad/don\u2019t listen. Also if you want to dive deeper down the rabbit hole, look at Martin Skreli (the man who got me interested in finance) \u2014 what he did to drug prices was actually for the benefit of patients and the detriment of for profit insurance companies. But that is just another example of how the average American simply doesn\u2019t understand how the healthcare system works/the media like clickbaity headlines.\n\nAlso I know you didn\u2019t try to complain about working 60 hour weeks to somebody who works in a sweat shop disguised as an investment bank.",

Give my take on the direction the industry is going and which companies will come out on top. Whether or not the companies make money? I really don\u2019t care \u2014 I get paid the same, the clients are paying for my time. If you actually listened to what I was saying, you\u2019d realize that I also care about the outcomes more than anything \u2014 the best outcomes just happen to be the most profitable. \n\nAs a nurse you don\u2019t see the big picture, you are a small (very important) cog in the machine that is our healthcare industry. As a result you form your opinion off of anecdotal experiences. The average nurse has no idea how the healthcare system works, it\u2019s very complicated \u2014 just like the average warehouse worker has no idea how AWS works. \n\nFinally, I didn\u2019t even think this was an argument bc to every person I\u2019ve talked to (okay \u2014 my boss talks to and I take notes) who gets paid to understand the healthcare industry (not simply work in it) nothing I said (for profit hospitals delivering better outcomes, Martin Skreli\u2019s business plan benefitting patients \u2014 who btw are not the ones paying for the drugs/buying it for $1 or free if they have gov plans or no insurance, capitated plans aligning quality of care and profitability, most new drugs come from the US) is really a debate. It\u2019s not profits vs. lives \u2014 it\u2019s understanding vs. not understanding. \n\nAlso a quick side note on Skreli, did you know that your view on him is EXACTLY what the big for profit insurance companies want you to believe? I\u2019ll actually just explain it real quick: Skreli didn\u2019t buy patents and jack up the prices \u2014 he bought the rights to a couple of drugs that treated conditions that affected a very small amount of people. As a result a cheaper generic drug wouldn\u2019t make sense to be produced as the market size isn\u2019t large enough to justify the high research and development spend. The thing is these drugs were HORRIBLE \u2014 they treated the conditions poorly and with side affects comparable to chemo. So Skreli bought the rights, jacked up the prices, but only charged patients who were covered under private insurance. What did he do with the profits? Well there were none. Why? 2 reasons: 1. He has to amortize the cost of buying the rights (similar concept to how a car depreciates or losses value) and 2. He used this to finance the R&D for new drugs to treat these conditions! So who\u2019s really getting shafted? The patients? Nope they aren\u2019t paying for it AND they could get a much better drug down the line. It\u2019s the insurance companies \u2014 and they were PISSED. Basically Skreli figured out how to help patients and force the insurance companies to foot the massive bill\u2026and all it took was a couple clickbaity headlines and a smear campaign funded by these big insurance companies to make him \u201cthe most hated man in America.\u201d \n\nLike I said originally, in healthcare there\u2019s cost, quality, and access \u2014 you get to pick two. I\u2019ve spent way too much time on Reddit today, so I think this is prob going to be my last message for a while.",

Her subsequent children were born in Moscow where she was attended diligently for a week after each birth to ensure she was in optimum health and it cost her nothing except the plane ticket, which was thousands of dollars cheaper than the health insurance she would have paid for here.\n\nI know another person who moved from America to Russia and when he got there they discovered he had cancer. He was not a citizen at the time, he was there on a tourist visa and they treated him. The hospital stay (about 3 months), treatment, doctors, etc all amounted to less than $1,500 out of pocket for him. He is now cancer-free and still lives there.",

I was one of three people seriously injured and they literally brought me in, cut off all my clothes, threw me into a room, and left me naked (in my blood soaked undies and bralette) for 12 hours before they even came to speak to me. I didn\u2019t even get a blanket. \n\nThe blood crusted into all my cuts and wounds so when my mom finally had enough of waiting for the nurses to clean the wounds my mom had to rip off the crusted blood to clean everything out. It was beyond painful. \n\nThen another two hours of waiting two second year students came to stitch up my face and arms. I refused to let them do my face because they were students and not even plastics students. It was a good call because they totally botched stitching up my arms and the scars look absolutely terrible. \n\nThen some 2nd year residences came from the maxiofacial department did my face stitches but no one wanted to fix my eye. They also kept arguing about whether my eye socket broke or not. \n\nFinally discharged me without even checking my legs or arms for breaks. They sent me to a regular eye doctors office where I had to get my eyelid reattached and glass removed from the corner. She didn\u2019t have anesthesia in her office so I just had numbing shots which burn a lot. I had to watch as she reattached the eyelid and cauterized the muscle so they didn\u2019t heal weird. It was obviously traumatizing. \n\nTook me 6 days to realize my knee was fractured. It was not good that I walked on it for so many days. \n\nTLDR: I was in the hospital for 15 hours. 12 of those were waiting naked in a hospital bed without even a blanket. My mom not a nurse had to clean my wounds because no one came. The doctors they sent to stitch me up were students who botched the stitches. Forced me to leave the hospital with an open wound to get eye stitches from a regular eye doctor. Eye doctor wouldn\u2019t/couldn\u2019t knock me out so I had to watch as they reattached my eyelid 0/10 would not recommend.",

I waited 4 months to have my gall bladder removed.  However when I went in with chest pains I was seen right away, even though it turned out to not be a heart issue.  And while it is possible that you could go to the ER and get that broken leg looked at within the hour, if they're busy, you could be waiting for several hours. ERs are triaged, and a broken leg is not usually life threatening.\n\nBut what some don't realize is that wait times are often longer because there are people in line.  In the US, some don't bother getting in line for treatment because they know they can't afford it. I may have had to wait 4 months to get the gall bladder removed, but I knew I would be able to have it done, regardless of my financial status.  If I'd been in the US given our financial status at the time, low income, but often not low enough to get financial assistance, I might have not bothered because I don't have thousands of dollars to pay for the surgery.",

I had a blood and urine sample taken to do testing, got an CT scan done and scheduled for every other type of scan, talked with a doctor and was put on medication on the spot.\n\nThe entire process took a week, including an MRI and a test that I can't remember the name of (sensors where put on my head and I was asked to look at some lights and then to fall asleep) at universities. I spent a total of 5 hours at the hospital, but I was on a cot in the hall instead of a room. Considering that I was stable and just needed some tests, I would say that that was damn quick.\n\nThe worst cost was that my parents where ticketed for parking due to the mess that is downtown when I went for a scan. I now have to pay $10 a month (it's the same cost if I ask for 3 months) for medication before my insurance pays their part.",

Pharma were the first to sign onto the program. They were asked to help others sign on. It gave them carte blanche.

Why be a doctor or nurse if you have huge tuition costs ? It doesn't pay to be a surgeon or specialist because of educational costs. \n\nWe need national healthcare coverage.

          "text": "I am sorry, but in many aspects the ACA was a failure. It did not address (well it did, but poorly and half-assed) the bigger issues that the US healthcare system had. \n\nThe biggest issue being that medical decision are dicated by an insurance company that has 0 medical basis for their decisions, solely monetary. \n\nIt also failed to address the fact that insurance companies just went around and forced the customers that could pay for insurance to pay more to compensate for their \"losses\".\n\nThen you have the fact that now hopsitals 100% care about getting most of their money back. Before ACA passed if you had huge medical dept for say an ER visit. The hospitals would tend to settle for discounted payment (usually the actual cost of the service and not the 1000% markup they charge you in the initial bill) now they will try to get as close to that markup as possible or throw your debt to a collection agency. Something that further fucked people who could not afford health insurance in the first place. \n\nThe final big issue that was failed to be addressed properly, was what is affordable. I had lost my job and had to be put on unemployment. Because I had a \"decent\" job I got the max my state offered for unemployment. Because I made what I made, I did not qualify for the cheaper health insurance, and didn't qualify to put my child on medicaid either. 2/3 of what I made a month from unemployment went to pay my insurance. I am blessed that I had (still do) family that was willing to help pay for my other bills, or else my family would have been homeless all because \"affordable\" is a subjective term, and being on unemployment can disqualify you from having \"affordable\" insurance.\n\nEdit: a bit of formating to seperate the different points.",

Show me someone that can justify that and I'll show you someone that doesn't have a soul.\n\nAnother difference is that in the US, on top of the taxes, we *still* have to pay for health insurance separately.  Nearly 2x as much as the average UK citizen.\n\nIt's... not great...",

It's kept quiet by those with hands in their pockets that, while yes it's another tax. they won't be paying a monthly premium. They're too dumb or too brainwashed to look at things critically. All they see is \"they're taking my money\".\n\nTaxes are also heavily despised since a lot of the spending power taxes generate is overlooked.  Highways, bridges, infrastructure in general. Tie that in with corrupt politicians, criminal organizations controlling unions or labor capital and sheer corporate greed. It's pretty depressing.\n\nUS citizens are also more or less brainwashed into \"bust your ass, get yours, retire\" and no one understands the concept of investing in the population.\n\nIt's fuckin bleak.",

The same is true for HIV patients and cancer patients.\nhttp://www.renalandurologynews.com/news/cdc-americans-can-not-afford-medications-eight-percent/article/395374/\n\nhttp://www.upi.com/Health_News/2016/06/03/Study-One-quarter-of-cancer-patients-cant-afford-treatment/8381464973916/\n\nNot just life saving drugs but surgeries, treatments, physio and more.\n\nThe uninsured have a 25% higher mortality rate than the insured in the USA.\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775760/\n\nMany Americans with health insurance avoid seeing healthcare professionals because of high deductibles.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/nearly-1-in-4-americans-are-skipping-medical-care-because-of-the-cost.html\n\nHealth insurance prices in the USA has been increasing between 3 and 5 percent a year and was higher in the past. \nhttps://www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/u-s-spending-healthcare-changed-time/#item-usspendingovertime_1\nUS health insurance prices are unsustainable including employer provided insurance which is why employers and pensions continue to drop insurance and why deductibles continue to increase for most people. \n\nIn Canada wait times are indeed a matter of concern for Canadians and politicians are pressed to minimize them. People slipping through the cracks are often front page news and Canadians get outraged. \nIn American the problem of Americans dying from lack of healthcare seem to be largely dismissed or ignored by half the elected politicians. Parents fundraising so they can afford lifesaving treatment is sold as a 'feel good' story on the news rather than a failure of their healthcare system. \n\nIn American people dying from lack of healthcare is just another day ending in 'y'.\nI repeat, for many Americans the wait time is infinite, they will die, unable to afford treatment.",

You are contributing to making your country a better place and a healthier nation. \n\nI was diagnosed with cancer just over 2 months ago, within 2 days of diagnosis I was in for the operation to remove it. Within a day after I was in for my CT scan to check if it has spread - within a few months of monitoring my bloods and CT scans (due to some potential worries of spread which luckily ended up not being an issue) I started one round of chemo to kill off any potential remaining badness and to stop it coming back. I didn\u2019t pay a penny for any of this outside of parking occasionally. \n\nIt was handled so quickly, with insane levels of professionalism and incredible access to specialists at basically any time I wanted advice. I am forever thankful we have access to such incredible services and am dumbfounded that other countries don\u2019t want to establish equivalents to the NHS.

Yikes. It would need major surgery to address it. This meant prescriptions also.\n\nDuring this time, getting scans etc they noticed he had a lot of firmness in his abdomen. This meant further checks and scans which revealed a problem with one of his kidneys. It was later discovered one of them wasn't working properly and for how long no one knows. It had to be completely removed and litres of fluid drained from his abdomen. \n\nDue to the aneurysm and the kidney they went ahead and done further health checks, because of his age also. Just to he safe.\n\nThis revealed some issues with his lung, which turned out to be a type of nodule that is similar to but not exactly cancer. He had to get booked in to have biopsy and later an entire lobe of one of his lungs removed. \n\nThis all happened in quick succession, and still years later is on meds and inhalers etc. \n\nHe's doing great and has recovered and has no real deficits.\n\nI have no idea how much this would have cost us without the National Health Service (UK). And what the ongoing costs would have been.\n\nIt would have potentially ruined an entire lifetime of pensions and financially ruined a married couple in their elderly years.\n\nThis model of health care isn't just a good method but the only logical, compassionate and non predatory method out there.",

While she didn't make it to chemo, she received major surgery to remove her tumor and spent a collective 3-4 weeks in the hospital before she passed away, and all any of us had to pay was for parking, meals, and in mine and my boyfriend's case, gas for the car because we live 2.5 hours away. Oh, and if she'd managed to make it to chemo, that also would have been totally free. \n\nConsidering the absurd costs of a single night in a US hospital that I've seen posted on here, yeah, I'll take our system any day of the week.",

It required everybody to have insurance, enforced by a tax penalty (essentially repealed, as Republicans changed the penalty to $0). It expanded Medicaid, which provides healthcare to the poor, to people making significantly more, although a number of Republican controlled states have managed to not implement it even though the federal government picks up something like 90% of the costs. It created various incentives and penalties to encourage more employers to offer insurance to  their employees. It created health exchanges, where people without insurance can go to easily shop for insurance, and take advantage of group rate discounts as individuals, and also provided income based subsidies (86% receive at least partial subsidies) making the insurance cheaper or free. It placed minimum standards on insurance, like eliminating their ability to refuse coverage based on pre-existing conditions, removing lifetime spending caps, requiring coverage of mental and reproductive healthcare, etc.. It allows parents to keep their children on their healthcare until the age of 26. Finally it implemented some modest efforts at controlling costs, which haven't reduced spending but seems to have at least slowed the rate of growth somewhat.\n\nBasically it was a bandaid on a horribly broken system, but overall it's still accomplished significantly more good than harm.",

You pay for it in taxes.  Because it is government run and not private, there is NO competition.  Therefore, the service is not as great.  The good doctors, will eventually leave.  They leave because governments are required to bid for the lowest bidder.  This means you get paid the least among your peers.  If you are good; you leave.  With 80k in student loan debt (and not to mention YEARS of hard work to become a doctor), if you were offered a government job at 65-70k a year or a private sector job at 250k a year the choice is clear.  The ones that are \"left over\" go to the government jobs.  I am not trying to be mean, just stating the obvious.  Governments, do not \"splurge\" on \"fancy things\" like the latest technologies, medicines, etc.  The result is that you end up with a second rate care.  I knew a girl in England.  She had a cracked tooth.  She had to go in, be seen.  She had to wait 1 week for that.  After being seen, she was referred to a dentist.  The total time BEFORE treatment was 4 weeks.  Imagine the pain!  That is government run for you. In America, you can be seen the SAME day.  \n\nIn short, you get what you pay for.  This is clear when almost every socialized medicine country starts sending their patients to the US for treatment.",

Sure you might need to wait a couple months for a knee replacement.  That's an elective procedure.  But if you get cancer you start chemo or radiation or whatever else immediately.  It's based on priority and need.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd that knee surgery you had to wait a few months for?  Guess what, you're still coming out ahead over the american system....because how do we handle our knee surgeries?  Well, you probably wait for a couple years before you even see a doctor because doctors are expensive.  Because the pain's bad, but not TOO bad.\n\nThen you finally go see a doctor and pay out of pock for that and your doctor thinks you should just wait until you can't handle it anymore before getting surgery because he knows you're young enough you'll have to have the implant replaced after about 10-15 years and he's trying to save you a surgery and many thousands of dollars.  In the meantime he prescribes you some 4 dollar generic double-strength Aleve for the pain.  (Or maybe he gives you oxycodone and you end up hooked on opiods)\n\nSo you wait a couple more years, in pain, but then once it's so bad you can't take it, they book you and you're in for a knee replacement within about 3 weeks.  Barely a wait!  So much better than the canadian system! That poor guy had to wait 4 months!\n\nOh....except for the fact that he went to the doctor the first time he had pain, got it managed, and wasn't told to just tough it out for years because of cost.  From symptom onset to relief the canadian knee patient beats an american by an average of 2-3 years.",

Autopsy showed everything was physically normal. To get to the bottom of it my uncle, brother and I were tested for  genetic disorders, this required blood tests, MRIs, stress tests and an adjmaline test on each of us to try to figure out if any of us had anything which could potentially prove the reason for my father's death and to catch anything early if we did have something. Turns out I have brugada syndrome which is genetic and my brother and uncle were lucky enough not to have it too. The MRI did find lung cancer in my uncle though (never smoked, just prone to cysts). So my uncle got surgery and I get regular heart check ups. I feel like if we were in the US we wouldn't have gotten past the autopsy due to the lack of necessity and things costing money.

For some Americans, there is no \"line\", they just go bankrupt, suffer and die.\n\nIn America, if someone dies in an emergency waiting room, it might make the news, but that's the expected outcome of a capitalist \"supply and demand\" based system.  Although some people will predictably die this way, it's planned and expected, and the deaths in waiting rooms don't change anything if there will be lower dividends to shareholders as a result of the change.  The reason we don't hear about \"wait times\" in America is because it's expected, it might not even make the news, so we wouldn't even hear about \"wait times\".  We don't lose our minds in America about the long waits and the deaths in American because denial of health care is all part of the capitalist healthcare plan.\n\nIn Canada if someone dies in an emergency waiting room, there's an outraged outcry against the Canadian politician who is responsible for this and who will have to answer for this poor planning and lose their job in the next election to a politician who will fix the wait time.  That's why you hear about \"wait times\" in Canada.  It's a demand to fix wait times.  And the Canadian wait times will then be fixed.  The reason why any wait times are such a big deal in Canada is because Canadians can and will complain - complaining is productive and part of the system and fixes things - and expect it to be fixed, because assurance of health care is the plan in Canada.",

Look up \u201csocialized medicine\u201d if you don\u2019t believe me.\n\nIs Canada\u2019s system perfect?  No, of course not.  But it\u2019s a helluva lot better than the American system.",

There are real issues. Since the govt is motivated to keep costs lower, doctors make less, so many good ones go to the US. There\u2019s also less ICU beds, hospitals become more overwhelmed quicker. And, in general, it is harder to find / switch doctors, and they do limit some treatment options for cost saving purposes. \n\n*If* (and it\u2019s a huge \u201cif\u201d) you have too-notch insurance in the US, I personally prefer the quality of care I\u2019ve gotten in the US, and many of the things my family has experienced in Canada wouldn\u2019t happen in the US. \n\n*But*\u2026it\u2019s a huge thing to never have to worry about cost.

The thing that despite the sabotage and constant propaganda is still a pretty popular policy, so popular that many republican voters get confused because they have been convinced Obamacare is a failure and then are shocked to learn that Obamacare is actually called the ACA which many republican voters use and like. That thing that when republicans finally got the votes to repel they couldn't even fully get rid of it because one of their own on his dying bed finally grew a conscious and swung the vote the other way. \n\nIf the ACA managed to find success and and remains fairly popular despite being a extremely watered down version and a decade of sabotage and propaganda, imagine how popular and successful a true socialized medicine policy would be.... US politics fucking suck. We are a barely functional government at this point because one side wants to return Federal policies to the 1800s and the other side has no spine and is constantly trying to appease a side that has demonized them.",

There was a small delay afterwards and they told me that they found something and I should go to Emerg at the local hospital, and they would call ahead. They handed me the Xrays and said to give them to Emerg. So I headed there, walked in and it was fairly crowded. I handed the triage Nurse the Xrays and she almost threw me into a wheelchair and I was immediately whisked off for treatment. ZERO waiting. They were waiting for ME in fact. I had a collapsed lung! I was given a chest tube so the lung would re-inflate, which it did. Months later it collapsed 2 more times and I ended up getting pretty major lung surgery. I never waited and never saw a bill.\n\nThe Canadians that usually bitch about wait times are usually selfish, and don't understand that hospitals triage you based on the danger of you dying. You can live 1 hour more with that severed finger, while I'm not going to live long without lungs.",

That's been exactly the point, for the three most significant health risks they don't, and most other health risks are unlikely to have a major impact either. \n\nNot to mention that, to the extent these costs exist you're already paying for them with private insurance, that's the entire point of insurance is to spread the risk, and beyond obesity fueled illnesses (which we already know don't contribute meaningfully to spending) you'll find very few the US has significantly higher rates of than its peers which are spending literally hundreds of thousands of dollars less per person for a lifetime of healthcare, with better outcomes, due to universal healthcare.",

The level of care is exactly the same - her Canadian doctors have authored the studies about the care of people in her condition - her American doctors were similarly world class.\n\nI see two big differences between the American and Canadian systems:\n\n1) In Canada I don\u2019t spend hours fighting with insurance.  It\u2019s not that they don\u2019t pay - they do it\u2019s cancer to say no is death - it\u2019s just the work it takes.  In Canada you just get the best care available as soon as it is available, paying for it isn\u2019t something to spend time on (there are gaps, like drugs, our system still needs work).  Wait times for life saving care are not long, you don\u2019t die of cancer waiting for an oncologist or a surgeon that\u2019s not a thing - we can do better in other areas and COVID certainly hasn\u2019t helped there.\n\n2) In Canada - everyone can get this care.  We had the means and the insurance to get that care in the states, in Canada that is not a factor.  As the top comment said - we pay it through taxes and I see it as a duty to my community to pay my fair share.",

Canada has just two acute care beds per 1,000 people\u2014the second-lowest figure among OECD nations. The United States, by contrast, has 2.5 acute care beds per 1,000 people\u2014one-quarter more per capita.\n\n> Canada also underperforms when it comes to critical equipment like MRI machines.

The United States, by contrast, has 2.5 acute care beds per 1,000 people\u2014one-quarter more per capita.\n\n> Canada also underperforms when it comes to critical equipment like MRI machines.

But the free health care in Qu\u00e9bec has some big issues as well.\n\nEdit\n\n[So many people without actual knowledge of the Healthcare system in Qu\u00e9bec down voting...]",

I'd consider it a bad thing that people even need to consider having those.\n\nIn the US we have:\n\n- Tons of different private insurance companies, but you don't get to pick from them, you only get to pick the ones work provides you.  If work doesn't provide it, you probably can't afford it.\n\n- HSA accounts to help make your insurance affordable when you actually need to use it.\n\n- Entirely separate insurance to cover things that your health insurance won't cover (i.e. Aflac)\n\nAside from the stupidity of the current system with it's multiple levels of complexity to make it usable for most people, the average person in the US pays 2x more per year than in other comparable developed countries.  On top of that 2/3rds of the US population don't believe they can afford medical expenses if they do need to go to the hospital (which means less people are getting care when they need it).\n\n>That's not my experience at all\n\nUnfortunately your experience isn't most people's experience.  Most people put more of their paycheck towards healthcare than any other country and still can't afford to go to the hospital because of out of pocket expenses.\n\nThe \"I got mine\" attitude is pretty shitty.  You should want better for other people.  (It would cost you less money too)",

Canada is in fact one of the worst countries for government run healthcare but it's still better than the states. The benefit being that eventually people do get treated if they need it, unlike many in the US that can't even go to the doctor because its too expensive. \n https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/healthcare/reports/2019/10/18/475908/truth-wait-times-universal-coverage-systems/",

Lived in different parts of Ontario (mostly Toronto) most of my life with family members who have had to undergo different treatments for cancer. They've never waited longer than a couple of weeks to see specialists, and they've always gotten the treatment that they needed.\n\nI moved to the US a couple of years ago, and healthcare has been good because I'm with an employer. But I'm a slave to them because I know I'm absolutely fucked if they ever let me go. During my last job transition, I had to pay $700/month for Cobra while I looked for a new job. It was terrifying.\n\nSo it makes no sense why our experiences are so different. Why have the people in my life had better experiences with Canadian Healthcare than you? Is it dependent on what provinces you're in? Is it dependent on how polite you are to the people you're contacting? I don't get it at all.",

My daughter is suffering from some rather debilitating anxiety, she can't talk in class, can't talk to her teachers, can't make friends, and she got a referral to a pediatrician in June.

And then there's Covid, where we found out Canada has about 1/3rd of the ICU beds per capita compared to the US.  \n\nIf you want socialized medicine look to Europe, not Canada.  Canada has been trading on the \"we're better than the US\" for so long we have made fixing our own problems akin to changing religions.  And it's not just me, our Supreme Court ruled that Canadians [ARE DYING ON WAIT LISTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaoulli_v_Quebec_\\(AG\\)#Deschamps)!\n\n>The appeal court's characterization of the issue as an infringement of an economic right is rejected by Deschamps. She goes on to note that the long waits at hospitals can result in deaths and that private health care prohibited by the Quebec Acts would likely have saved those lives. The wait lists, she claims, are an implicit form of rationing, and it is the government's rationing policy that is being challenged here as a violation of the right to \"security of person\"\n\nEdit:  too many people think \"wait times\" means ER wait times.  NO!  Wait times are the time between referral to a specialist and seeing one/getting treatment/surgery  Young people especially have no clue what a wait time for a chronic condition can be like in Canada.",

I at least have some respect for the republicans who think those attempts just weren\u2019t good _*enough,*_ but those who think it\u2019s an attempt to turn the system into some shitty downgrade are idiots.\n\nEdit: before the inevitable arguments start, I\u2019m not trying to suggest a solution, cause I don\u2019t have one.

I'd rather that than all of us paying in a relatively much smaller amount and running the risk of *someone else* being shot or stabbed or getting cancer *not* facing financial ruin.\"\n\nGranted, I've never been in a waiting room staring at the clock wondering if I'd be attended to before I bleed out, which apparently happens all the time in Canada if what I'm told by American conservatives is correct. Maybe my attitude will change when I'm faced with that inevitability. \n\nWhat I know for sure is, the money I pay into healthcare via taxes was never gonna put a lambo in my driveway. If it were my choice, too, I'd never have the malice in my heart to tell a five year old that her and her whole family can get fucked, I don't care if they lose their house trying to pay for her leukemia treatment, not my problem. But I can see how it would be easier to vote for that kinda thing, hoping you'll never be personally impacted or have to see it with your own eyes. It's cowardly for sure, really contrasts with the whole \"I'll fight and die for my country any day of the week\" demonstrations I've seen of willingness to sacrifice it all over an extra piece of cloth you have to wear and not being able to visit a barber, stuff like that, but I see how it's easier to vote against something that might ask you to sacrifice a few bucks.",

Could not afford to go to the er, and held off a week before the pain became so intense they didn\u2019t have a choice. They were able to get the cast on but aren\u2019t required to take it off as it is not an emergency. They had to keep the cast on another month past healing until they could afford to have it taken off through a low cost clinic. There was damage to the muscles because it had been kept on longer but pt isn\u2019t affordable and they make you pay up front. Most places require a credit card in order to schedule your first appointment. You just have to pray it gets better on your own if you can\u2019t afford it. Even pregnancy isn\u2019t covered here. Friend was married and they made decent salaries so they couldn\u2019t get free health care. She had to pay 3,000 to her obgyn for prenatal services and the hospital bill was 20k. Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019re still paying on it today. This was an \u201ceasy\u201d birth with no epidural or extras. I have great insurance and I don\u2019t deny this, when my daughter started having debilitating migraines and they referred us to a neurosurgeon who specialized in kids, we had to wait 8 months. The average wait time for this place is 9-12 months, they were able to fast track us. I\u2019m not even in our biggest city in my state. It took my friend a year of pre approval authorizations for her daughter to get a swallow study and then speciality classes for her 4 year old to learn how to chew, swallow and deal with different textures. They had to stop once they found out their out of pocket expense was 400 a session. She had fo have a session a week.",

This isn't an indictment of Nationalized health care, it's an indictment of the people getting mad at emergency conditions getting higher priority than their non-emergency, as well as Quebec doin gworse than average with the global shortage of medical personnel.\n\nAlso there's this, from an Ontario doctor:\n\nhttps://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/podcast/2018/oct/truth-about-waiting-see-doctor-canada\n\n>CHRISTOPHER HAYES: So I guess it\u2019s \u2014 it depends on what do you think you\u2019re waiting for. So if you are in a hospital and you need surgery you don\u2019t wait. It gets done in \u2014 if it needs to be done in 30 minutes it will be done in 30 minutes. If you need an MRI for care provided in a hospital you will get it whenever \u2014 depending on where you are because not every hospital has an MRI, but you will be prioritized and that will happen probably as quickly as it can be done anywhere. It is as the priority drops or is deemed less by whomever that the wait \u2014 so the waits are how long will you wait to see a specialist after seeing your family doctor.\n\n>I mean, the one that people will talk about is cataracts, hip surgeries, non \u2014 not cancer type surgeries, where there \u2014 things will get worse if you don\u2019t get treated. And so you can wait months for those surgeries.\n\n And then there's this:\n\nhttps://healthydebate.ca/2020/09/topic/assessing-wait-times-in-canadian-eds/\n\n>Under present circumstances, wait times are a trade-off between patients and physicians. While patients want optimal care in the shortest time possible, it is the time-consuming and effective assessment that allows doctors to maximize diagnostic accuracy.\n\n>When evaluating barriers to healthcare service in Canada, it is critical to adopt a multidimensional view. Rather than placing the blame on physicians for slow processing of individuals, patients must understand that they are trading time for high-quality service. It is this give-and-take relationship that generates an effective healthcare system.\n\nSo on balance, I'd still happily trade you my expensive, inefficient, for-profit healthcare for your occasionally inconvenient wait times.\n\nWhich suggests that, to the extent the problem isnt entirely in your head, it's localized to your provence, and your provencial government could fix it.",

The most I spent was around \u20b911000($150 roughly) for transportation and sending him some snacks, fruits and reading materials. Only cost towards the ward was an effervescent tablet strip to dissolve the phlegm in his lungs and throat (since they couldn't get it in their stock) and the final tip towards the staff for all the work they've done for my dad's 17 day stay there (December 13th to 30th). Every consultation post that for the next five months was free, medicines being the only cost.\n\nAnd this is how that hospital works. Even outside of COVID, everything is free of cost except for medication. My uncle until he passed, had excellent treatment for his heart condition there for 20 years.

So we already have paid in around $11, 500 / year.  Then I have to pay the first $1,500 of \"covered\" procedures (about $13K spent so far) then I pay 20% of all expenses up to $4.5K, So I just paid in about $18,000 and I am waiting for insurance approval for \"every\" procedure.  Remember they don't cover procedures that impact their profitability.  \n\nI wait at least 3 weeks from the time my surgeon orders an MRI and the Insurance approval, most deny the initial request and only agree after surgeon re-applies (5 week wait).  \n\nI wait at least 4 weeks from the time my surgeon orders a spinal injection for insurance approval.  \n\nThese waits attribute to the opioid crisis because the only thing the doctors can do while waiting is treat the pain.\n\nPretty shitty system, but it works great as long as you don't need it.  \n\nI understand that there is an implied bureaucracy with Healthcare that we will never totally do away with.

Ambulance to local hospital, diagnosed, transferred to premier brain surgery hospital, underwent emergency brain surgery, hospitalized for 16 days, 5 in ICU. Not a single bill or charge and 100% full recovery.\nNow for two identical stories. A friends mom moved to the US years and years ago. Was doing well, insured, whole bit. Gets lung cancer. Over the next six months in and out of hospital a number of times. Final days of her life hospitalized. Bills were significantly beyond her net worth. My friend called a lawyer who said, take whatever personal effects you want, lock the door and walk away. Bank will foreclose on house and they likely will not come after you since you live in Canada. Nothing left for her children or grandchildren. All gone. \nBy contrast, my mom passed from lung cancer two years ago. She was hospitalized three times with the last times being two weeks at two different hospitals. She was transferred to hospice once stable where she survived another two weeks. Zero bills or invoices. My mother\u2019s wishes for her grandchildren will be fulfilled. Me and my family were not forced to pay funeral expenses. \nIt\u2019s not free though, it is paid through taxes. Canada just doesn\u2019t spend trillions on the military and instead ensure the populace can be healthy.\nOne last set of examples. In Florida on vacation one of our children got his head split open on a water slide. Ambulance to the hospital and 8 staples to close it. As is pretty standard my employer provides travel insurance as part of the benefits package. Insurance paid it all over the phone with hospital admin and we walked out. At the same time a couple came in to emergency and the woman was holding her left arm. Doctors suggested an x-ray. She refused because of the cost and they walked back out.\nThis all 100% true, first hand experience.",

She was also on an autoimmune treatment that would cost $5,000 monthly if it wasn't covered.

Obamacare just to set up a way for those without insurance to recieve it. What should have happened was companies should have offered better alternatives themselves. Instead they used it as an excuse to provide plans that were too expensive or too restrictive, forcing the cost onto the employee. Not to mention the broken insurance system we have with high deductibles and co-pays. Again, forcing the healthcare costs onto the working class. Add on top of it, the absolute absurd billing systems of the healthcare providers themselves, and it's basically a game of \"how much money can we milk from patients/insurance companies\". Actual universal healthcare would solve a lot of these issue, as evidenced around the world. People don't seem to get that a marginal increase in taxes will likely heavily outweigh the insurance premiums alone. Even more so if you actually need to use/pay for healthcare out of pocket. But can't make a horse drink, I suppose.",

Statistically, wait times in Canada _are_ very long, and there _are_ a lot of horrific stories about people waiting months _or years_ for medical care. There are also stories of the government literally denying people access to medical care for any number of reasons. There is also a really good reason that medical tourism is _huge_ in America (and elsewhere in the world, too).\n\nPeople on both sides of this argument are very often wrong. The \"best case\" in both the American and socialized systems is that you get the healthcare you need when you need it. I broke my hand years ago, and my grand total out of pocket was something like $75 - almost entirely to the pharmacy and co-pays when I showed up for my doctor's visits. When my son was born, we paid a grand total of about $250. The people who are adamantly pro-socialized medicine want you to believe that this is **not** incredibly common in the United States.\n\nThe people who are against socialized medicine want you to believe that nobody ever gets medical treatment and that every single person in the country is literally waiting in line to be seen by a doctor. This is obviously not true.  \n\nThe reality is that no healthcare solution is \"best\" because the conditions needed for any system to operate perfectly are literally impossible to achieve. Canada (for example) doesn't have nearly enough doctors to handle the immense demand because when people have access to free healthcare _they use it_. I have talked to dozens of Canadians who refused to provide me with records because they were scared their doctors would get mad and drop them as patients, thus jeopardizing their ability to access their healthcare. And again, when you have to ask permission from the government to get treatment, _they can say no._",

From my understanding, in Canada both of those issues are nearly identical to what we have now. The only things we have better in terms of healthcare than Canada and other countries are the niche specialist surgeon/doctors that most people will never see in their life. \n\nWith wait times, sure they'd get longer but from my understanding the difference would be very small and likely not even noticed.\n\nThe point that isn't mentioned but is a very common one brought up is taxes. This really is the part I'm not too confident about so if someone who's unbiased and only going off facts, please let me know where if I'm incorrect and please educate me if I am. \n\nBut, that being said my understanding is that the average person who currently has healthcare would actually pay less in the new tax than they are currently paying for their premium/deductible.",

Clearly there were way more important medical cases than my little bite (I only went to the ER in case I needed rabies shots). A 5-hour wait was just the price of my stupidity. But from the get-go, I was treated as a \"patient\" not a \"customer\" and I was treated compassionately thoughout.\n\nMy granny only needed three stitches, but headwounds bleed like crazy and my gran bruised extremely easily, so she looked like someone who'd nearly lost the top of her head. So when you get to the admitting desk and it sounds like a disaffected teenager at the GAP cash register asking \"Will that be cash or credit today?\" it was really jarring. \n\nGran had insurance, but still I've never had an emergency service ask \"How are gonna pay?\" as the first question.",

Generic pharmaceuticals are $15 to $35 max. All copays go toward the deductible and individual deductibles are $1000. I also just got an additional coverage for $25 bucks that will immediately cover my deductible and out of pocket maximum in the event of a catastrophic emergency. I'm American and my plan isn't unique for a lot of people but the major issue that I believe is at the crux of the problem is that healthcare isn't delivered consistently nor fairly.

With average lifetime healthcare costs of $879,125, obesity accounts for 0.99% of our total healthcare costs. \n\nhttps://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/overweight-obesity\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1038/oby.2008.290\n\nWe're spending 165% more than the OECD average on healthcare--that works out to over half a million dollars per person more over a lifetime of care--and you're worried about 0.99%?\n\nHere's another study, that actually found that lifetime healthcare for the obese are *lower* than for the healthy. \n\n>Although effective obesity prevention leads to a decrease in costs of obesity-related diseases, this decrease is offset by cost increases due to diseases unrelated to obesity in life-years gained. Obesity prevention may be an important and cost-effective way of improving public health, but it is not a cure for increasing health expenditures...In this study we have shown that, although obese people induce high medical costs during their lives, their lifetime health-care costs are lower than those of healthy-living people but higher than those of smokers. Obesity increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes and coronary heart disease, thereby increasing health-care utilization but decreasing life expectancy. Successful prevention of obesity, in turn, increases life expectancy. Unfortunately, these life-years gained are not lived in full health and come at a price: people suffer from other diseases, which increases health-care costs. Obesity prevention, just like smoking prevention, will not stem the tide of increasing health-care expenditures.\n\nhttps://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/46007081/Lifetime_Medical_Costs_of_Obesity.PDF\n\nFor further confirmation we can look to the fact that healthcare utilization rates in the US are similar to its peers. \n\nhttps://www.oregonlegislature.gov/salinas/HealthCareDocuments/4.%20Health%20Care%20Spending%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Other%20High-Income%20Countries%20JAMA%202018.pdf\n\nOne final way we can look at it is to see if there is correlation between obesity rates and increased spending levels between various countries. There isn't. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/d31bOFf.png\n\nWe aren't using significantly more healthcare--due to obesity or anything else--we're just paying dramatically more for the care we do receive.",

That means more Americans are waiting for care than any other wealthy country on earth.\n#Wait Times by Country (Rank)\n\nCountry|See doctor/nurse same or next day without appointment|Response from doctor's office same or next day|Easy to get care on nights & weekends without going to ER|ER wait times under 4 hours|Surgery wait times under four months|Specialist wait times under 4 weeks|Average|Overall Rank\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:\n**Australia**|3|3|3|7|6|6|4.7|4\n**Canada**|10|11|9|11|10|10|10.2|11\n**France**|7|1|7|1|1|5|3.7|2\n**Germany**|9|2|6|2|2|2|3.8|3\n**Netherlands**|1|5|1|3|5|4|3.2|1\n**New Zealand**|2|6|2|4|8|7|4.8|5\n**Norway**|11|9|4|9|9|11|8.8|9\n**Sweden**|8|10|11|10|7|9|9.2|10\n**Switzerland**|4|4|10|8|4|1|5.2|7\n**U.K.**|5|8|8|5|11|8|7.5|8\n**U.S.**|6|7|5|6|3|3|5.0|6\n\nSource: [Commonwealth Fund Survey 2016](https://www.cihi.ca/sites/default/files/document/cmwf2016-datatable-en-web.xlsx)",

Basically, how serious is your condition and when can it (or does it) need to be dealt with. That determines your wait time. Americans seem to think at-your-service medical care is a right, but isn't. Access doesn't mean instantaneous, but the fact your spot is ceded to someone who needs it more makes complete sense *unless* you're a selfish (or rich) asshole. \n\nIs the Canadian system perfect? Of course not. But it also doesn't bankrupt families due to unforeseen medical conditions. Far more egalitarian, and access is far more widespread than south of the 49th. And we're damned proud of it, much like the British are with their NHS.",

      "text": "Eight years ago, my doctor told me that, given my age, I was to do a FIT test. This only required that I give a stool sample. I took the kit home and finally got around to collecting the sample some 2 weeks later. I dropped the sample off at the lab and promptly forgot about it. The following week I got a call from my doctor saying that they had found blood in my stool and he was handing the case off to a surgeon to determine what needed to be done. The surgeon contacted me the following day to tell me the next step was to schedule a colonoscopy for three weeks from then. Three weeks later I was in the recovery room trying my best to get rid of the enormous amount of air in my intestines a half hour after the procedure, when the surgeon came in and showed me a picture of what looked like a scrape on the flesh inside the mouth. It was the lesion in my large intestine that caused the blood to show up in my stool. I was told the only remedy was to have that section of intestine removed. He scheduled the surgery for a month later. In the meantime, I was to get a CT scan, just to eliminated some potentially complicating circumstances. Our health care system tries to make the most use of its resources, and my CT was to be done at 10:30 PM. I'll always remember the tech saying \"We've got what the doc wants, but we'll just put a bit of contrast in the IV and get a picture of your vascular system.\" Ten minutes later I was on my way home. At 8:15 the next day I received a call from the surgeon saying he had made an appointment with a vascular surgeon for 10:30 that morning. He told me that I had a Triple A, an abdominal aortic aneurysm, and I was fortunate to catch it before it ruptured because it was almost three times the size of an ordinary aorta. They used the OR time they had scheduled (the following week) for the bowel surgery to repair the aorta and then rescheduled the bowel surgery for a month later.\n\nI often wonder, what if I were american, and didn't want to shell out the 350 bucks for a test I was taking just because I was in my mid fifties? Or the extra whatever for a CT with contrast? Americans can fuck off with their whining about Canada's health care wait times. The bottom line is that our health care system tries to give the people what they need when they need it, without bankrupting them.",

Then they gave me three litres of IV fluid, left me unattended in the bed with an empty IV in my arm for another few hours, then gave me another litre before sending me on my way with a \"oh hey btw you're diabetic\".\n\nTotal cost: at least $10k, spread across a few separate bills, weeks apart.\n\n\nAnother time, I needed stiches at 2am because I'd accidentally cut across the inside of all my fingers with a kitchen knife.

                  "text": "> The middle class really gets hammered in Canada\n\nHealthcare costs are all that is relevant to a discussion on healthcare. But even their total tax rates aren't dramatically different from the US. \n\n#[Total Tax Burden by Country 2020](https://www.heritage.org/index/explore?view=by-variables&u=637133255533864635)\n\nCountry Name|Tax Burden (% GDP)|Tax Burden ($ PPP)|Gov't Spending (% GDP)|Gov't Spending($ PPP)|GDP/Capita (PPP)\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\nAustralia|27.8%|$14,560|35.8%|$18,749|$52,373\nCanada|32.2%|$15,988|40.5%|$20,085|$49,651\nUnited Kingdom|33.3%|$15,220|41.0%|$18,752|$45,705\nUnited States|27.1%|$16,966|38.1%|$23,838|$62,606\n\nAn American family of four making the median family income of $59,039 in Virginia (the state with the median effective state income tax) will have $48,120 take home after payroll taxes and federal and state income taxes. A Canadian making the equivalent amount in Saskatchewan (the median taxed province) will have $42,968 take home after CPP/EI and federal and provincial income tax, minus a $5,060 child tax credit for a net of $48,028. Not that different at all. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States  \n\nhttps://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-states-to-be-a-taxpayer/2416/\n\nhttps://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes#f2fjW1V01t\n\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/child-family-benefits/child-family-benefits-calculator.html\n\nhttps://simpletax.ca/calculator\n\nFeel free to repeat this process for other income levels, family sizes, and locations. \n\nOf course this only covers income and payroll taxes. The overall picture includes sales/VAT taxes, property taxes, corporate income taxes, etc.. Given the complexity, it can be useful to turn the problem on its head and look at government spending per capita, which must be recouped via taxes (at least eventually--deficit spending can make people pay those taxes in the future, plus interest). \n\nSo as we see above government spending in Canada is 40.5% of per capita GDP or $20,085 per person. Spending accounts for 38.1% of US GDP, or $23,838 per person average. Again, not a huge difference. \n\n>I\u2019m also not for increasing taxes, that always leads to governments over spending/waste.\n\nAh yes...totally illogical to reject something that all  the research shows would save us money, and has led to dramatically less spending for better results in every single peer country. \n\n>Also do Canadians have the right to free speech? How hard is it to own a firearm in Canada?\n\nAgain, totally irrelevant, but I understand you're desperate for things to feel superior about. Yes, freedom of expression is protected as a right under Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, and Canada ranks 7th in the world in guns per capita. Overall Canada ranks 4th on the Human Freedom Index and the US ranks 15th. \n\nhttps://www.cato.org/human-freedom-index/2019",

Americans are paying a quarter million dollars more for healthcare over a lifetime compared to the most expensive socialized system on earth. Half a million dollars more than countries like Canada and the UK. Our system is so inefficient we don't even get a break on taxes. \n\nWith government in the US covering [64.3% of all health care](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2015.302997) costs ([$11,072 as of 2019](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/highlights.pdf)) that's $7,119 per person per year in taxes towards health care. The next closest is Norway at [$5,673](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm). The UK is $3,620. Canada is $3,815. Australia is $3,919. That means over a lifetime Americans are paying a minimum of $113,786 more in taxes compared to any other country towards health care. \n\nAnd the way the costs are distributed in other countries keep people from having their lives destroyed by medical bills. One in three American families had to forgo needed healthcare [due to the cost](https://news.gallup.com/poll/269138/americans-delaying-medical-treatment-due-cost.aspx) last year. Almost three in ten had to [skip prescribed medication](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/data-note-americans-challenges-health-care-costs/) due to cost. One in four had [trouble paying a medical bill.](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/issue-brief/data-note-americans-challenges-health-care-costs/) Of [those with insurance one in five had trouble paying a medical bill](https://www.kff.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/8806-the-burden-of-medical-debt-results-from-the-kaiser-family-foundation-new-york-times-medical-bills-survey.pdf), and even for those with income above $100,000 14% had trouble. One in six Americans has [unpaid medical debt on their credit report.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/millennials-rack-up-the-most-medical-debt-and-more-frequently) [50% of all Americans](https://news.gallup.com/poll/317948/fear-bankruptcy-due-major-health-event.aspx) fear bankruptcy due to a major health event.\n\n> I have personally observed a number of Canadian citizens who came to the US for care of serious medical conditions.\n\nOn average Canadians visit the US for care once every 680 years, so let's not pretend it's common. And more Americans leave the country for healthcare. \n\nAbout [345,000](https://askepticalhuman.com/politics/2018/10/16/debunking-republican-healthcare-myths-people-come-to-us-for-care) people will visit the US for care, but about [2.2 million people are expected to leave the US seeking treatment abroad](https://www.patientsbeyondborders.com/media) this year.",

Hospital sells your medical debt to a 3rd party debt collection \"Agency\".\n7. 3rd party debt collection \"Agency\" calls you\n8. Answer, do not admit to having a debt, or acknowledge that there is a debt.\n9. Request the ID number or file number of alleged debt. Then hang up\n10. Create a debt validation letter\n11. send a copy to 3rd party debt collection \"agency\" and all credit bureaus.\n12. Wait 3-12 months as your medical debt vanishes into thin air\n\nWhen your medical debt is sold to a third party debt collection agency, you never agreed to allow the debt to be sold, nor did you ask anyone to purchase it. Therefore, they paid off your medical debt for pennies on the dollar, and now say you owe them. There is no agreement between you, and the debt collection \"agency\". If they cannot legally prove that you owe the debt with an agreement made between you and the debt collection \"agency\". You are not legally obligated to pay that debt until they can prove it with legal documents. \n\nYou should never agree to pay a debt that cannot be legally verified as being owed. The fact that the debt collection \"Agency\" failed to notify you of their interest to pay for your debt, and to take on this burden in order to get you to pay for it in installments is not your fault. If they did this of their own volition, that's their problem, not yours. No amount of threats can change those facts. \n\nI had $17,000 worth of medical \"Debt\" according to several debt collection agencies. I sent them all debt validation letters many times over the course of a year. I never received validation of my alleged debts, and these alleged debts just fell off my credit, and never reappeared. I haven't gotten any calls, threats, and my name doesn't appear in any form of legal requests in any state.\n\nThis is a legal gray area, and I've consulted with multiple lawyers pertaining to it. If the debt collection agencies decide to drop the alleged debt of their own volition, then I'm no longer legally obligated to pay any of it. All you would be doing is asking them to legally prove that they not only have a valid claim to collect this alleged debt, but that you are legally obligated to pay it. If they cannot legally prove it, and you keep demanding they do, eventually they will drop it.\n\nWho do you go to to pay off the debt? No one, no where, and that debt collection agency will just write it off on their taxes in whatever way they do it. You will be 1 out of thousands who don't pay, and that is not a big deal for them.",

The fifteen years before the ACA employer sponsored insurance (the kind most Americans get their coverage from) increased 4.81% over inflation for single coverage and 5.42% over inflation for family coverage.

And wait a lot. \n\nA few years ago some public hospitals stopped to give people doctor notices releasing them from work this made people who only went to the doctor to being released from work to stop going in the hospital. \nMondays and Fridays or the day before and after long holidays was the worst people only went to hospital to get a notice releasing them from work.",

How many of us in USA have called to make an appointment and they say the next available is six weeks out. Hospitals have people waiting to see someone for hours and some super busy hospitals in big cities have people waiting for 24 hours.  What it really boils down to is people who have insurance feel they have better healthcare than the poor and if it\u2019s socialized then they have to see the same doctors the poor people see. But damn that would also mean the poor people would get the services they need and free up the emergency rooms as poor people tend to use the er as a primary office.",

Went to the ER, all the nurses I've seen were saying how they've never seen something that big(the tumor that is of course). Was told to wait for a call for an MRI appointment. Got that call 2 weeks later with an appointment for 2 months after the ER visit. At this point the tumor is growing and when I'm seated the blood flow in my leg is cutoff from the pressure. \n\n\n\nFinally get the MRI, I'm told to wait for another call after a technician analyse the images and diagnose. 2 months later I call them back and they still haven't looked at the images, they overbooked with brain imaging. 4 months later I call back, still haven't looked, they don't know when they'll be able to. Tumor at that point is roughly football sized and growing fast. \n\n\n\nAt this point I'm starting to panic. Girlfriend has a family member that works in imagery in a rural area. We mail her the CD they gave us after the MRI and she looks at the imagery during a lunch break(What I had been waiting for 4 months apparently was a 20 minutes affair) and came back to me saying that it looked bad and was probably malign. We get in touch with our doctor who works her connection and gets me a biopsy two weeks later which confirmed the diagnosis. At that point the service was fantastic, operation went great and everything went well but getting into the system was an absolute nightmare and I would've died waiting without some connections. \n\n\n\nIn similar fashion, we moved 2.5 years ago and had to get another doctor. Our province doesn't allow us to be on the waiting list for a family doctor if you already have one, doesn't matter if you're 3 hours away from your current doctor. So we had to drop our doctor, put ourselves on the list and now have been waiting 2.5 years and counting for a doctor despite having cancer history, my girlfriend having chronic illness and having a newborn daughter. \n\n\n\nSome parts of canada probably have decent healthcare but Qu\u00e9bec has trash tier healthcare and I'm ashamed of giving 30% of my paycheck to taxes when half of that goes to healthcare. I'd rather be in the US healthcare wise, health insurance would be cheaper than my tax rate and I'd actually get service when I need it.",

That means that if there is a wait you're not happy about you have options that still work out significantly cheaper than US care, which is a win/win.\n\n* [One third of US families](https://news.gallup.com/poll/269138/americans-delaying-medical-treatment-due-cost.aspx?utm_source=alert&utm_medium=email&utm_content=morelink&utm_campaign=syndication) had to put off healthcare due to the cost last year.

So they get some good and some bad doctors. \n\nA few years ago on active duty I pull a strange string like thing out of my eye, the next day my eye hurts still so I go to my primary care doctor who gives me a jar and tells me to come back if I catch another one. A few weeks later I get another one, bring it back in said jar, they have it tested and say it's not a parasite.\n\n I get a referral to an optometrist about a month after the initial incident. I sit down he looks at my eyes and says \"your eyes are fine, why are you here, what do you want out of this visit?\" Implying I'm just trying to get some type of disability before my EAS or something. I tell him \"I want to know what's wrong with me and how to fix it.\"  He reiterates that I'm fine and asks me to leave. Feeling defeated I go home and wonder if I'm going insane.\n\nMonths go by, I get out of the military, due a backlog and covid the VA refers me to an optometrist in a local mall. I walk in, sit down, and run through about 4 different types of tests, within 15 minutes they tell me the stringy things I pull from my eyes sometimes are from a combination of allergies and dry eyes. Whenever my eyes feel off now I throw in some saline drops and pop a Claritin/benadryl or whatever and I haven't had the stringy things since.\n\nI lost faith in socialized medicine that day. If a private mall doctor could tell me what's wrong with me in a matter of minutes and how to fix it why would well paid government doctors just tell me there's nothing wrong with me.",

Its not socialized medicines fault that their are doctors who just don't care. \n\nEdit: I forgot to add a nurse practictianer asked if I had x-rays i said no and she was shocked at that and put in a request but the main doctor had me try to touch my toes and he started pushing on my back to try to get me to touch them. At the end of the appointment he told me I'll let the x-rays go through but I highly doubt we'll find anything. Turns i have a completely fucked up back and I've had a surgery already to help correct some of the problems.",

It does not say anything about how long it took for an ambulance to arrive, or time for emergency surgery. \n\nThe article you put up sounds scary, but it does not provide context for WHO is waiting for WHAT care. \n\nIf I have an appointment for a mole removal, and get hit by a car.

The next closest is Norway at [$5,673](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm). The UK is $3,620. Canada is $3,815. Australia is $3,919. That means over a lifetime Americans are paying a minimum of $143,794 more in taxes compared to any other country towards health care. \n\nIn total, Americans are paying a quarter million dollars more for healthcare over a lifetime compared to the most expensive socialized system on earth. Half a million dollars more than countries like Canada and the UK. \n\nIs that enough honesty, or do you want more?",

They have no more choice to opt out of that than people anywhere. \n\nAmericans can choose to either get or not get private insurance. If they choose to not get private coverage, they're still paying more for healthcare than people in other countries they're just not getting healthcare for it. If they choose to get private coverage, they're paying thousands on top of the highest taxes in the world towards healthcare. People in other countries can also choose to get private insurance or not. If they choose not to they still have at least basic healthcare, and they're paying less in taxes towards healthcare than the American. If they choose to get private healthcare, it will be dramatically cheaper than healthcare in the US (private family insurance in the UK runs about 10% of what family insurance in the US costs). So Americans have the choice of paying a little more (with no insurance at all) or a lot more (with private insurance), and people in other countries have the choice of paying a lot less (with just public insurance) or a little less (with public and private insurance). \n\nAnd you with your very big, very stable brain have somehow concluded this is a good thing for Americans. By all means, explain yourself.",

If you think wait times are ridiculous now with private insurance? Wait until it\u2019s universal. It won\u2019t cost anything, but going to the Doctor will be like going to the DMV. It just won\u2019t work here with today\u2019s Americans. Too much  laziness and entitlement.",

Patients use it as primary care due to not having a primary care doctor, not wanting to wait and see their doctor, thinking they\u2019ll get care faster or not having insurance. Wait times can be hours or days depending on the area; add to that the people who have delayed care for over 18 months due to the pandemic and it\u2019s a shit show. \n\nWait times for any specialists are already 3-6 months out for appointments due to the backlog of patients that couldn\u2019t be seen or patients that put off care universal healthcare wouldn\u2019t change that.",
