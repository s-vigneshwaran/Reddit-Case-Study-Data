Tell him you aren't asking for his forgiveness, because you know he's moved far beyond the hurt you caused him, but you just wanted to let him know that you've changed.

Years later, after we both grew up and got Facebook, I accepted her friend request but still was bitter and didn't trust her. Finally, in my 30s, I brought it up to her and she remembered and apologized profusely. Apparently she was coerced into it by her own parents, and since then, her parents did the same thing to her when she got got divorced from her husband (a pastor) and again when she came out as a lesbian and learned how hurtful it was. Knowing all that, and knowing that she now knows better gave me closure, and now instead of being angry or hurt, it's just a \"funny story from my childhood\". The Christianity (and the adults enforcing it) is the toxic, hurtful force, not the children once trapped in it.",

It's true sometimes apologies feel selfish when they don't come with a whole changed persona. At the same time we are free to mistake, express what hurts us and if you feel like reaching out maybe waking that up that person will know how to deal with it regardless of your imaginative weakness.  We're love! Stop the voice in the head a little and love more. If you love that person, what do you really want to do for them? Or is it that you are trying to love yourself thru the love others give you with their forgiveness? That's another way to validate love to yourself. Insecurities only hurt so do it with you heart and go all in!",

This literally made me think of stuff from when I was a kid, things like \"person A is throwing things at person B\", \"person A is threatening person B\" \"person A just hit person B\" gets thrown in the same box as \"person A has their cell phone out\" -_- note: first 3 are examples from my own life.\nI literally knew someone who got out of school suspension because his bully hit him and broke his finger in the process. Teachers didn't see but he tried to tell a teacher. He had a black eye but other kid had a broken finger. The teachers had ignored him every time he tried to \"tattle\" on his bullies because \"they didn't see it\" there should be a clear line, but there's not, apparently not for (some) teachers, and especially for kids. I had someone who repeatedly hit me upside the head with a notebook, tried telling, got brushed off and had other kids calling me a tattletale. Thankfully he ended up doing it in front of a teacher and got told off.\nI feel like specifying this was all sooo many years ago, I'm in my late 20's and these are middle school memories. I am perfectly safe. Previous comments had me annoyed and the one I'm replying to specifically made me go \"thank goodness someone said something\".",

Many adults want to keep everything simple for them, so they end up with the dumb policies like always punishing the tattler or punishing everyone or whatever. \n\nAnd different kids are wired differently. My daughter is an adult, and to this day gets stressed out when people are breaking rules. That didn't come from us. When she was little, I'd pick her up from school and she'd be upset because she saw one of the other kids chewing gum in class. I'd ask why it bothered her so much and she'd say because it's against the rules. I'd tell her that, for something that isn't hurting anyone else, she should just let the teacher deal with it, and there was no reason to stress over it, but stuff like that always bothered her, and the adult equivalents still do today.",

I do not think they mean to imply that it actually is Gay, but rather that based on the previous behavior it would be considered so by the same boys.

I recognize that white supremacists consider interracial relationships as bad, and would be confused if there were a Klan member married to a Black woman. This does not mean I agree with them though does it? It means that humans can recognize when you are not consistent with your own evident beliefs. Though your grievance isn't with that is it. It is evident by the fact you put the very real and present cultural problem of toxic masculinity in scare quotes.",

Your opinion, your generation's opinion doesn't become law, and the opinion of millions may not become law. America, as it set up is where the minority opinion ends up winning in the end and making laws. We are set up by our own constitution for the majority to NOT actually matter, the minority opinion has more power. Our system is that fucked up. You can vote and yes if Millennials actually showed up to the polls it would help especially in state elections but Millennials have failed miserably at actually showing up to vote unless it is a general election. So the minority opinion wins, in the end, wins because they always, always show up to vote. Also, its is too late at this point.2016 was the deciding factor and people voted for Trump. SCOTUS is stacked as is until Alito or Thomas probably dies or retires.  Which is going to be years down the road.",

For one, they don't proselytize, as entering the 'faith' actually has some hurdles to jump through, so they have no reason to go around pushing their beliefs on others. If they have a problem with homosexuality, they keep it to themselves. Also, no real belief in an afterlife as all that was added in the new testament and quran, so no fear of being damned or desire to 'save the souls' of others. So yeah, Jews are pretty chill compared to the others.",

              "text": "Nope. The others still are, and as a gay man I'm getting tired of this mentality. It's Christianity. It has been and will be. Are there more and more Christians becoming progressive and accepting? Sure. Most of my family is Christian, and while one half doesn't accept me, the other does. \n\nBut if we rule stuff like this out and say it's not a part of the religion, then Christianity is small enough to be considered a cult, and has only really existed for maybe a decade or so. It wasn't until the late 2000s that we started to see acceptance in society. And then it wasn't u tol the start of the 2010s that the majority of people started to accept us. Before that? At best we got \"love the sinner hate the sin\" or what ever thing people said to make themselves look better. But we were still beaten and killed fairly regularly. Shit, that still happens today. And honestly, this feels more like a slap in the face than allyship. Because people have been killed in the name of Christianity. Many of us suffered in the name of Christianity. And to simply hand wave that away does nothing but sweep the problem under the rug.\n\nAnd it's not just the gay community. Religion was used to justify slavery. Then we moved away from that and it was used to justify everything else black people went through. Christians would gather their families together to go sit down at the park and have a picnic while watching the local entertainment of having black people hung from trees or burned to death.\n\nIt was also a large part of manifest destiny... which was basically us just committing genocide against the natives and stealing their land. \n\nHow about women? Well, we can go all the way back to the Salem Witch Trials where women were killed because people thought they were worshiping Satan. Or we can talk about the fact that women have always been seen as property to men. Even so much so that women couldn't even get their own bank account until the 70s. Like really think about that. Even when they started being able to work, the money went to the husband's account. Not generally a joint account. The husband's. Because it was his. \n\nThere's a reason Christianity is dying. No, really, [people are leaving the religion.](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2021/12/14/Pew-poll-religion/4101639510653/) It's gonna take awhile before it's even close to gone, but the youth are moving on. Many are doing so because we have seen the hatred coming from it.\n\nIf you want to be an ally to marginalized communities, don't pretend like there isn't a problem, or just push those people are the others. Like I'm white, and I am fully willing to admit that our problems with racism come from white people. I am willing to call them out.\n\nI also don't say \"Not all men\" when women are talking about the problems they have. Because while, sure, technically true, all it does is diminish the problems men cause, and doesn't address the issue so we can fix it.\n\nPeople need to move past this notion that they're not real Christians. Even ignoring that it is a no true Scotsman, to me all I hear is that you are the victim by people associating your religion with the bigotry it has always had, rather than the people actually suffering. I don't suffer from racism. And the problems men face tend to actually be problems caused by men that were used to systematically attack women. I am ultimately not the victim, so I am not gonna try to be. When people call out white people, I agree because I support black liberation. When people call out men, I agree because I support women's rights. I'm even willing to call out other gay people when they are being bigoted. And I do this because I want my community to do better so other people don't suffer.",

I'm an advocate of public school education, but when my kids were born, we moved to an area with good public schools rather than stick them in school in the crap system we were in. If we couldn't have relocated for whatever reason, I would have made the same choice as you. \n\nIt's too late for kids in school now, but I do hope that someday parents will be able to send their kids to public schools anywhere in the country and feel like they are getting the education they deserve in one of the world's wealthiest nations. I do think it's feasible to fix things for future kids, but if our elected officials (state and federal) keep taking steps to funnel more kids and more money into private schools without making any radical, expensive changes to improve public schools, public schools will just keep getting worse.",

Most \"members\" of these religions may not consciously recognize it, but the entire thing is structured to enforce a hierarchy, and a class system where some people are \"better\" than others, and a select few are \"ordained\" to possess the preponderance of wealth, authority, and control. It's been used as the justification for kings, queens, emperors, and \"royalty\" since the beginning.\n\nThe modern iteration has adapted itself to more democratic governments by manipulating the \"members\" into electing rulers that reinforce the hierarchy, in order to ensure the \"others\" are \"kept in their place\", even if that runs counter to their own self-interests.\n\nThroughout history, these religions have been extremely successful in convincing the masses that ideas like slavery, racism, classism, misogyny, homophobia, religious discrimination, eugenics, genocide, and countless atrocities against a group of \"others\" is justified and right, because their particular brand of god ordained it.",

In one of the screenshots, the user has a tab open to a Turkish-language page called (in Turkish) \"Everything You Wanted To Know About Our Solar System.\"\n\nThat web page is on a website called bukrek.com, which is named after B\u00fckrek, the \"good dragon\" in the mythology of the [Altai people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_people).  The \"bad dragon\" is called Sangal.   According to the myth, the dragons fought for 9 years.  Hmmm, that seems a little short-sighted for ancient mythology.\n\nB\u00fckrek (bukrek.com) should be confused with Bukrek (bukrek.net), a Ukranian publishing house.\n\nTo the left of that Turkish page on the solar system is a tab in which, presumably, is an image of the solar system, which was presumably found by searching Bing, which is the tab to the left of that.\n\nBing is interesting to me, because it's not Google.  But that might just be because this user is on Windows, the default browser on Windows is currently Edge, and the default search engine in Edge is Bing.\n\nBut another thought that I had is of certain Christians over the years, who have avoided the use of Google because \"they pay for abortions,\" or some shit.  So I wonder if this school requires the use of Bing (and you would think if you're avoiding Google, you would avoid Microsoft for the same reasons).\n\nObviously the most interesting thing about this is the Turkish-language website, suggesting that this Christian school student is at least of Turkish descent, and may even find it easier to read about the solar system in their native language than in English.\n\nBut alas, I'm looking too deeply into this :)\n\nWeird that science would appear in the same browser session as this nonsense.  Seems like they would teach that all the students need to know about \"the heavens\" they could learn from The Bible.\n\nI was a little surprised I couldn't identify that task-evaluation software, based on what it is (I've used software like that, specifically Taskstream) and the favicon that's right there in the tab.  But no dice on that.  It's not a big deal, but it's an exact clone of what I remember about Taskstream.   I'm a little surprised that a secondary-school student (lower than university) would be using task software like that, but I guess remote learning was a boon for that sort of thing.\n\nEdit:  Found it.  It's called [Canvas](https://www.instructure.com/k12/products/canvas).  That's what the school uses for their \"digital classroom\" stuff.",

It's a good thing that our family loves and supports our kids to be the best that they can be and that we are on this journey with them.

They feel the same way about abortion as I felt about women throwing their babies in the dumpster. To them it\u2019s the same thing, so of course they feel very strongly about it. It doesn\u2019t matter so much about extenuating circumstances, as it\u2019s viewed generally as being wrong so it should be illegal in the same way. \n\nNow I don\u2019t agree with them, but I can understand their position if this is indeed how they feel. I realize that my reaction to the dumpster baby video probably had more to do with my own fatherly instincts kicking in and projecting my emotions to protect my own children onto this baby.",

In some instances sanctioned. \n\nKilling people for being gay pretty much started with the Abrahamic religions. In fact I believe that in the western world the first actual known law banning homosexuality was in 1290, and was deemed an offense against God.",

Some places with no law still attached a social stigma to it.\n\nThere is a pre-Christian Asyrian law which considers such an act an offense against the state, and further stipulates that \"If he is formally convicted, [he is subjected] to a twofold penalty, namely to be treated in the same way as he has treated his victim and to be made a eunuch.\"^^1\n\n\nThe dominance of Christianity and Muslim faiths certainly meant that their persecution of homosexuality dominated human culture along with it.\n\n^^1 Assyrian Laws edited by Driver and Miles, 1935",

It is an individuals decision.\n\nIf you chose to be straight, then maybe you're not actually straight lol. people typically don't choose their sexual orientation. it's not a decision to fall in love with someone, regardless of their sex. just like it's not a decision to be attracted to the same sex or the opposite sex. \n\nit has literally nothing in common with addiction and disease either. unless being straight is also a disease or addiction. animals all throughout the animal kingdom have been observed to exhibit homosexual behavior.\n\n>Homosexuality seems out of touch with reality, and not aligned with the natural order of things. The whole point of sex is reproduction. Last time I checked that requires a male and female. So it\u2019s just as deranged to sleep with another man as it is an animal. It\u2019s just self pleasure.\n\nwell then all sex for pleasure is deranged. if you enjoy it then you're deranged, right? regardless, your disagreement with something benign does not give you power to then prevent other people from doing it.",
