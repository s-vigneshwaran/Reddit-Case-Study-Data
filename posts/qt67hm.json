That's a very different thing.

If he was worried about the gunshot he should have first figured out who fired and whether they were a threat. If he saw that person and they were aiming at him and he shot them, maybe we could start talking about self defense. But that's not what happened.",

The actor may intentionally use only such force or threat thereof as the actor reasonably believes is necessary to prevent or terminate the interference. The actor may not intentionally use force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm unless the actor reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself.\n\nSo from the above, I think it\u2019s important that the law states that the ACTOR reasonably believes it is necessary. So that is where I\u2019m getting the \u201cfeel\u201d aspect from. Obviously, there\u2019s levels to reasonableness. It could be argued that Kyle reasonable concluded that he was in a gun fight and had to use force. \n\nAgain, he could be found guilty. Im just suggesting that it\u2019s not as open and shut as many think it should be.",

What happens when two increasingly polarized groups of heavily-armed citizens, all of whom are operating under the belief that those left standing will most likely be able to successfully claim self defense, clash in the streets? A fucking dance-off?\n\nI hope I'm fucking wrong, I hope I'm being an alarmist, but to me, this whole thing, in the context of the past five or so years, has Civil War II written all over it.",

It's just quite literally asking for trouble. I don't even carry a gun most of the time. It's just not really necessary in my opinion. \nFrom time to time I will but not in the instances you would expect. \nI'll carry if I'm going on a hike and it's deep into a desolate place.

From what I've read/heard, to the exact letter of the law what Rittenhouse did was technically self-defense and that's why it's likely he walks right?\n\nWhich to me seems like an incredibly flawed law if you can essentially forcibly create a situation to fit your self-defense law and get away with it. Does USA really not have a \"if you create the situation requiring self-defense it's not self-defense\" clause in the law? Because that's what sounds like happened that night.",

If he had what legally qualifies as justification to do so (e.g. self defense), then it's not legally murder. If it can be proven that he intended to kill before the incident, then he's likely guilty of some form of homicide.\n\nHe's a budding militia boy, not a lone-wolf mass shooting spree type like Br---k or R--f, so he didn't publish a long incomprehensible manifesto online before shooting his victims.\n\nWarning: wild speculation incoming! He was most likely taught several things in his lifetime. First was probably that anyone not living a conservative macho American whites-first \"Christian\" life is an enemy who's out to force everyone who *is* living the trad life to change. He was likely also taught fighting and firearms discipline under the auspices of being a hero who would protect his trad neighbors from the mincing hordes of communist non-white-supremacist LGBTQ people. He probably also learned to identify and/or manufacture situations where he could get into fights and claim self-defense. He might have bought into the rhetoric that he would be defending people on some level, but really what he wanted, like most 17-year-old boys, was to violently fuck something or someone up. I wouldn't be remotely surprised if it were revealed at some point that he was looking to step up in whatever militia group he was palling around with.\n\nHowever - and this part is *not* wild speculation - he and his compatriots were *not* hired or invited to guard or protect the business they were \"guarding.\" They were, regardless of what any of the protesters did, trespassing on the private property they claimed they were there to defend. Not only that, but he had some safety of numbers while he was there with his compatriots, and his claims of \"de-escalation\" are ludicrous.",

The cops and judges are usually on their side, and this case is obviously no exception. If Kyle were black, he would not have even gotten a trial because the cops would have killed him in the street that night as soon as they saw his gun.",

The facts and Wis state statute are that KR was **NOT** in any danger when he spun and fired 4 shots in .76 seconds into the *back* of a man as he was falling. He was a scared child who put himself in a situation with a weapon he could not legally possess and he murdered someone. After that it was all good people trying to disarm an active shooter. Question - If an armed bank robber is running from the scene of the crime and people are trying to stop him, can he claim self-defense when he shots those individuals? Seems ridiculous doesn't it?

I agree with you that people who shoot at a person who is posing a threat to others and they shoot back, it should not be considered self defense in a greater context. I am not sure if this context is being considered in the case because as far as I knew it wasn\u2019t, which is a major issue.

In Wisconsin that means that even if they believe KR is sincere in his belief of self-defense but acted recklessly he is guilty of murder in the 2nd degree. I don't see how any reasonable human being can disagree with that assessment of the first murder. If the first is true then the others must also be true. \n\nThe time he spent getting to know white supremacists will turn out to be the best thing he ever did. He will definitely need their protection.",

Think about that. If you were up on any charges and confident that your attorney had done their job would you agree to *adding* charges for the possibility of not getting 1st-degree?? I was in that situation and I told them to shove it. I was convicted and sent to prison. It wasn't easy but I proved I was innocent and got a judge to throw my case out and expunge my record.",

      "text": "Did you see the videos released? He was running around the day of putting out fires and assisting *rioters* medically. Then he has a pedophile chase after him screaming and throwing objects at him. Kyle sure looked like he was trying to avoid conflict as he ran away from rosenbaum who was saying saying \" I'm going to f*** you up \". Then after that altercation he's trying to get away from the angry mob of people running after him . But I'm sure he could just turn around and explain to everybody there calmly what exactly went down and why it was self-defense. I'm sure the mob would have listened.\n\nI bet the clear cut damn near HD video of Mr Huber trying multiple times and succeeding to hit Kyle with the trucks of a skateboard wasn't reasonable either. He was probably a paid actor. Because attacking someone laying on the ground with a skateboard isn't a reason to shoot them. \n\nOh don't forget the last guy either. You know, the guy who admitted that Kyle only pointed his gun at him when he first aimed his Glock at Rittenhouse prone on the ground. That guy definitely surrendered, and Kyle unjustly shot him. Because if someone puts both their hands in the air, and then tries to step around you while extending their pistol arm towards your head, that's surrendering. He was probably just trying to give Kyle his brand new pistol. Very thoughtful.\n\nIf all this stuff was subject to just eye witnesses and hearsay, I would be far more skeptical of what actually happened. But luckily for Kyle, just about all of this was caught on tape. Ive asked a few of the lawyers I know about this case and all of them said it was one of the best self-defense cases they had seen in a long time. The fact that this is even tried is a joke. Poor Kyle, liberals white supremacist punching bag. Imagine being 17, having to defend yourself from an attacker who screaming expletives and trying to beat the s*** out of you while you're on the ground only to survive the altercation just to get raped by the media unjustly. Watch the unedited videos, don't go to CNN, don't go to Fox. Watch the videos yourself with his little bias as possible then come back and tell me it wasn't self-defense. Don't want an argument, don't want to hear about your hurt feelings, happy to discuss it however.",
