It makes no sense, to believe that there is a  Satan. \nSo why support a satanic prayer on a football field if you don't believe in God, but yet you believe in Satan? .\n It's like an Oxymoron.\nIt's like  this if you have ever read the Bible with understanding you  know God created Satan.\nYou can't worship one, and say the other doesn't exist. \nThat's like a doubled edged sword",

I had wondered if it would be possible to see exactly when the coach of a school is outside of his official capacity. He just coached a team during a game. The game is over. But he prays right after at the 50yd line.\n\nHow is he not still acting in his official duty? Is he not responsible for what his team is doing or needs to do after a game? Is he allowed to just leave minutes after the game ends? I assume there would be duties to fulfill in the locker room. Kids that need commending or possibly medical attention. \n\nI guess I just didn't understand how this person, a government employee, would be able to act in his official role, but just take a little \"off-duty\" break after a seemingly pivotal moment. \n\nNot even to mention away games, where the coach would seemingly be responsible at all times for his team.\n\nIdk. Maybe the specifics are meaningless for that, but it rubbed me just as wrong as holding \"voluntary\" prayer in the middle of the publicly funded field at all.",

The school even offered this as a compromise, that he could return to the field after the team goes to the locker room.\n\nThe majority claimed that these prayers were like other momentary private activities that don't involve students, such as taking a personal phone call. They of course completely ignored the repeated prayers that did involve students (and that conspicuously going to the 50 yard line in a public display isn't the same as using the phone on the sideline).",

They have their post game whatever they do.\n\nHe was clearly on the clock, and several of his students admitted to feeling pressure to participate or lose their spot on the team. We are talking about direct witnesses who felt compelled to participate who testified.\n\nAlso, his praying on the 50 yard line is not a deeply held belief.  Before he took that job, and after he left it. He hasn't continued to go there to pray.   Deeply held beliefs don't appear and disappear when you change jobs.\n\nGorsuch also lied in his decision, which was called out by the dissenters, we have video evidence that proves Gorsuch was making things up to suit his needs.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kmM2N8gG7k\n\nI also grew as an atheist kid, and several of my coaches did the praying thing. I participated in pretend, because I was afraid of being outed,  I was never comfortable with it, but accepted it as a necessary evil to hide the real me.  No child should have to feel that kind of pressure, and I don't believe that my coaches were doing it to be evil, they were good men, who didn't understand their influence, I hope. Maybe they do hate Atheists, but as a child I sure as hell wasn't going to attempt to find out. No one needs coaches and the rest of the school riding their ass for stuff like that.  Several of my coaches failed me and many other kids over the years.",

We could also chose to get paddled instead of detention. I had like 25 swats on the ass one semester in baseball. We never thought it was strange either.

Not proud of it and I know I was an idiot.\n\nAnyway, as part of my sentence, I had to go to court ordered AA meetings. There were so many of them that talked about \"needing\" to go to up to two meetings a day to stay sober.\n\nWhat really stood out to me while listening to these people talk and watching their behavior was, they would stand up and talk about beating their addiction to alcohol. That entire time nearly all of them were chain smoking cigarettes and chugging coffee by the gallon. Then of course there was the religious aspect of the whole thing. They would of course do the whole higher power shit while claiming that belief in some god was not a requirement. Then of course they would close every single meeting with the \"lord's prayer\". \n\nIt's just another religious cult.",

Then have to get up early Sunday for Sunday school and then main service which finally end just in time to have lunch and spend the rest of the day sitting in the car riding back home so that you can do chores, have dinner and go to bed just to get up and do it all again for another 7 days of getting up early. It really sucked.",

High school stadiums have time limits during football season, so instead of being able to do 3 games on Saturday, you run the clock with prayers and force it down to two.

Either Sue for discrimination OR have as *many* non-christian groups apply to bog down the rotation and force the district to not have any christian prayers that season.",

It's about preserving and strengthening the white Christian power structure. They have made it clear in past months that they don't care about the facts in the case, or about precedent, or even about being consistent with their *own fucking rulings*.

Vitale* (from 1962) - as we just saw, it did not apply to Christian prayers because the majority ignored the facts - leaving *Engel* and other precedent in place so lower courts will still be bound by them when a non-Christian prayer happens.\n\nTo be clear, the enforcement of these rulings ultimately starts from students/community members filing lawsuits. For the most part, Christians will enjoy popular support and will rarely be sued, while non-Christians will draw lawsuits instantly... there could be occasional Christian prayers that get stopped, but the whole point of *Kennedy* is to turn a blind eye to the inevitable selective enforcement while pretending to be neutral.",

One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.\n\n* People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.\n\n* Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought.

Christians take rulings like Kennedy v Bremerton School Dist. not as general, but as clear victories for Jesus's influence over America. They do not want any other religion prosthelytizing to children and will do anything within their power to stop it. \n\nSo it's both. It's categorically wrong, but since the Supreme Court already ruled we must make the legal system reaffirm these rights are for ALL religions, not just Christians.",

Having Sundays off is normal, Christian holidays being federally recognized is normal, politicians using Christianity to justify laws is normal. So when they see a teacher praying to Jesus in a classroom, or the Ten Commandments in front of a public courthouse it's not really a jarring image. We are biased to view Christianity in our lives as a given and don't question it when it shows up in places it shouldn't be.\n\nBy showing people an example of a religion that is NOT considered normal, or even considered evil by many, doing the same it can help highlight the reality of allowing religion to bleed into the government. Putting up Satanic symbols in front of courthouses or praying to Satan in the classroom can help someone empathize why someone would be against allowing Christians to do the same.\n\nAlso when these schools inevitably start denying Satanists the same religious practices they allow Christians, it's showing the public that a lot of those \"it's just about freedom of religious expression\" talking points are provably bullshit and people will be less likely to buy it next time around.\n\nAnd for the people who will never acknowledge the hypocrisy and will still do everything in their power to push for Christian Theocracy, it's good to it harder for them to do that. Even if it makes them mad. Fuck 'em.",

They had 4 years where they controlled the senate and were 100% willing to shit on any democratic rule or institution in order ram through their will against the wished of citizens.\n\nThe answer is because they know that surrendering all that unquestionable power to democrats would be a massive mistake for their agenda.\n\n>So the filibuster is just another litmus test to see if a person is informed or spouting nonsense.\n\nYes, if you're a leftist and believe the filibuster should be repealed 4 months before the most important midterm election in US history hands down, its proof that you have absolutely zero idea how our legislature works, and why.",

We here is all the time, as they attack gay people and when gay people say 'you know thats kinda mean and bigoted\" they scream its really the gay people who are intollerant.\n\n\nyou know people who think its cooling instead of warming and that covid is a big hoax and that this preacher is doing nothing wrong that no one in their right mind could complain about, sometimes have to get slapped in the face with reality, because facts just dont work with that lot. SORRY.\n\nYES im on here often saying better than the church of satan would be left wing preachers, because they are harder to dismiss, like you are doing, as doing nothing but being confrontational. But in the same breath, id never condemn the satanists for punching back when we all were punched first. SORRY.\n\n\nI get it, we have the high ground but its kinda amazing that only one side, is expected to always polite and has to say sorry a lot. while the other side say gay people are the spawn of satan and pedophiles. And we say \"hey stop being a dick\" and then people like you say \"why are you so confrontational, it doesnt help anything\"",

FFS they straight up lied about the facts in the Kennedy case - it does not get more illegitimate than that when you're supposed to be a *judge*. When you start lying about the facts in a case in order to reach your pre-determined, ideologically-driven conclusion, you lose the right to call yourself a judge IMO. They are illegitimate in that sense, and I can tell you right now they're not going to be impeached within the foreseeable future.\n\nIt's not great, but I see no reasonable alternative than to flatly disobey their orders.

The Satanic Temple is on unequal footing in the courts from the get-go, and as much as TST would like clear \"wins\" in the courts, it's not always going to be that way. With the way the system works, sometimes the victory is incremental, like the Scottsdale case. TST was denied the invocation, but the judge's written opinion indicated that Satanism is indeed a sincerely held set of religious beliefs and must be treated as such. TST has to fight very hard for every small victory, and I'm not sure why this is a surprise for anyone.\n\nI could go into what each campaign does as well, but I suspect that none of it will be enough for whatever standard you're using. Grey Faction's complaint against a conspiracy theorist, Satanic-panic therapist who pulled a gun in session and claimed to have Satanic symbols burned into her uterus resulted in a hearing and her subsequent firing. The After School Satan Club has provided a non-evangelical, non-proselytizing after school activity for students in places where community members have requested it. The Religious Reproductive Rights Campaign has facilitated access to reproductive services to people who have made requests for assistance. The Satanic Representation Campaign has facilitated Satanists' participation in public life and equal representation in local events. The Good Works Campaign has facilitated a slew of donation drives, most famously the Menstruatin' With Satan drives that collect menstrual products for distribution to those in need. Local congregations often have various clean-up programs for beaches, highways, etc, as well.",

Many major traumas come from near death experiences, I would say the mere knowledge of our inevitable end could create that same response in people.  Just because it is largely embraced in society doesn\u2019t exclude it from the premise.  People say they see angels, see lights, etc that no one else sees.

Can a school or district  not just set policy saying \"no teacher lead prayer on campus\" or some other form of compromise? schools already have restrictions/policies that could be argued as infringment on rights. Our society is filled with caveats regarding limits to our rights.  Per the constitution our rights are not absolute. At the very least why not just institute the ol \"moment of silence\" as the standard? Everyone shuts up for a minute or two to reflect or pray and people move on without having to announce what they thought about.  It's so confusing that this is a thing.\n\nI'm getting downvoted so I'll clarify. Regardless of how the facts of the case were twisted The ruling states that the district violated his rights by not allowing him to pray after games even with students and parents around to see his public display. To my understanding the idea is that this doesn't immediately count as the district allowing an employee to endorse a religion because hes praying as a private citizen. What I'm saying is why can't the district just set a policy where a teacher is considered still on the job until their students or players are all off campus or until that teacher/coach fully closes up shop and steps off campus?\nWould that be a work around. \n\nPlease instead of downvoting me I'd love for someone to help me understand the situation if I've misinterpreted the implications for this ruling or its meaning",

              "text": "I fully agree. I was asking more to better understand the options that a school has at this point. I personally think that a teacher or coach still speaks for the school so long as they're on campus. They don't just \"clock out\" while they're in the school even after the Bell has rung. A coach to me is still on the job for as long as they have students they're responsible for hanging around. If a parent or student can walk up to you to ask you questions related to your job and the setting is on a district owned property or other location that is school sponsored they're speaking as a district employee. To me that feels like there's still wiggle room for schools to work with but I'm trying to figure out if I understand the full meaning of the ruling",

So a lord could only stay in power if he has people to work for him and the peasants could only stay alive if they are defended which developed the common system of a castle surrounded by villages.\n\nDuring this time as Lords were passed down (usually) hereditary the system of remembering ones forefathers  was reintroduced to keep track of old Lords in case one line died out and they had to go back to another branch.\n\nThe catholic Church during this feudal time acted as a sort of power above the Kings to make sure that they kept both Christian and remain good leaders. Which over time led to more and more rights being given to the peasant classes.\n\nTldr: click the video link",

So a lord could only stay in power if he has people to work for him and the peasants could only stay alive if they are defended which developed the common system of a castle surrounded by villages.\n\nDuring this time as Lords were passed down (usually) hereditary the system of remembering ones forefathers  was reintroduced to keep track of old Lords in case one line died out and they had to go back to another branch.\n\nThe catholic Church during this feudal time acted as a sort of power above the Kings to make sure that they kept both Christian and remain good leaders. Which over time led to more and more rights being given to the peasant classes.\n\n Anyway the removal of tribalism gave people more autonomy and introduced individualism to Europe and later the Americas\n\nAnd with the catholic church insuring the rights of peasants if gave them the free will to decide their lives\n\nAnd the drive to discover the concept of creation should be obvious with the amount of funding the catholic Church put into both art and the sciences as well as the amount of devout Christian scientists.",

In the US we have Christian Nationalists trying to destroy democracy and impose their version of Christian Theocracy.  We have religious leaders calling for the execution of homosexuals and atheists.  For generations, US churches have enjoyed massive tax exemptions and subsidies.\n\nedit:  I hit the send key a bit early.\n\nYour claim about atheists always talking religion is utter nonsense.  Most of us don't talk about religion or atheism outside of Reddit except when religious people bring it up.\n\nI am never the first to bring up religion.  Never.  But I have Christians constantly proselytizing.  In my community Christians can put up giant billboards all over town.  They threaten me with eternal torture.  But the religious community goes batshit crazy when an atheist group does a roadside cleanup and gets the word \"Atheist\" on a small sign.",

Christianity lost a lot of Millenials.  They lost even more GenZ.  Christians are doing a better job of destroying Christianity than anti-theists could ever hope to do.",
