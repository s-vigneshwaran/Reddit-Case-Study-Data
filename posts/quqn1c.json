Vocally, multiple times.\n\nAlso several Democratic legislators in the US Congress tried to prevent certification or to decertify election results in 2016.\n\n\u201cOne by one, the Democratic lawmakers stepped to the microphone on Friday, holding on to their letters and an impossible dream: denying the presidency to Donald J. Trump, two weeks before his inauguration.\n\n\u201cAnd one by one, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u2014 presiding over a joint session of Congress to validate the Electoral College results in Mr. Trump\u2019s victory \u2014 turned back their challenges with a stoic message, pounding his gavel without hesitation.\n\n\u201c\u2018It is over,,k Mr. Biden said at one point, as Republicans rose to their feet to cheer.\n\n\u201cAfter weeks of fitful grumblings about the long-shot maneuvers that might obstruct Mr. Trump\u2019s path to the White House, the proceedings on Friday appeared to close the book.\n\n\u201cLawmakers are permitted to make objections to both individual and state tallies, but they must be submitted in writing and signed by at least one member of both the House and the Senate. No senator chose to join the cause of the half-dozen or so House Democrats who raised complaints.\n\n\u201c The result was a parade of clipped protests from House members, drowned out quickly by the questioning of the vice president, who also serves as the president of the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe members spoke of voter suppression, of Russian interference and of the bracing fear consuming many Americans.\n\n\u201cMr. President, I object because people are horrified,\u201d began Representative Barbara Lee of California.\n\n\u201cRepeatedly, Mr. Biden asked if anyone could produce an objection that was joined by a senator.\n\n\u201c\u2018In that case,\u2019 he said, to Republican applause, when no one could, \u2018the objection cannot be entertained.\u2019\n\n\u201cAs the exercise neared its end, Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, stepped forward. \u2018I do not wish to debate,\u2019 she said. \u2018I wish to ask: Is there one United States senator who will join me?\u2019\u201d\n\nApparently, Democratic objectors are fine and they may fight certification of election results or lie (Russian collusion has been revealed to be a hoax cooked up by Clinton operatives, paid for by Clinton\u2019s campaign) with no consequences. GOP ones are vilified as enemies of the state. (I am not denying the 2020 election results. I didn\u2019t vote for Trump nor Biden.)\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/democrats-attempts-to-deny-trump-are-rejected-in-joint-session.html",

I put that in quotes bc those people are not truly Americans, they are citizens who have NEVER believed in the Constitution, except as it applies to white men.

It was one of trump\u2019s campaign promises to have the Johnson Amendment (named after LBJ who included the amendment in the tax code when he was a Congressman) repealed, but like every other promise he made, he failed to get it done.

We had to pay every last dime of our travel costs for the missions\u2014the church didn\u2019t pay for anything. And the particular church I went to at the time brought in around $5 million/year in \u201cofferings\u201d (tax-free of course), and IIRC the most I was authorized to give out in benevolence gifts to people was around $1000 for the year (and that was spread out to like 7-8 people to pay for a utility bill mostly). They had a clothing donation center for people to give their unwanted clothes to, which they then would donate to homeless shelters down in the city, and they\u2019d donate food as well\u2014but just what had been donated to the church by others. I\u2019m sure they did other stuff here and there, but on the whole, they actually used very little of that $5 million/year (tax free!) on \u201ccharity.\u201d\n\nWhat they were was a business, with a few full-time salaried employees, that used other people\u2019s willingness to help \u201cGod\u2019s house\u201d to get free labor for building repairs/upgrades/renovations/projects and big discounts on all kinds of shit for the church, and didn\u2019t pay taxes on any of that income. They even had a coffee shop that was run by volunteers with donated food/drinks that they charged people to buy, yet didn\u2019t pay taxes on either. The pastor, assistant pastor, and music director all live in the same neighborhood about 10 minutes from me in half-million dollar houses (and their wives don\u2019t work) and drive big new trucks that I\u2019ve never seen them use for any \u201dtruck\u201d purposes. \n\nMy overall impression was that someone was walking around with a lot of money in their pocket.",

In the Bible,  7 is considered a holy number by virtue of being the first prime number.  6 is consumed the number of humanity because it is beneath 7.\n\nNero marked letters as 66 ( i believe) to mock this belief, and to try and say he was a person of the people.  Later 666 was documented as the \"number of the beast.\"\n\nIt's meaning however was not that 666 denotes a demon. It was that people will be the down fall of humanity,  or that we are our own worst enemy. \n\nHope you enjoyed this fun fact!",

If I make a religion around cannabis consumption, should my dispensery now be tax exempt despite its income? I don't believe so, nor do I think you would believe so either. Same goes for if you start preaching out of your house; that doesn't mean you should be exempt from tax on that property.  Free speech is free as in \"freedom,\" not as in \"free beer.\"",

If an audit was done by the IRS, and they revoked Tax Exempt Status, your point is not valid. \n\nIn order to keep their tax exempt status churches and religious organizations must abide by certain rules according to the IRS.  Under IRS code, \u201call IRC section 501(c)(3) organizations, including churches and religious organizations, are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in, or intervening in, any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for elective public office . Contributions to political campaign funds or public statements of position (verbal or written) made by or on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to any candidate for public office clearly violate the prohibition against political campaign activity.\u201d By breaking this rule, the IRS may deny or revoke the tax-exempt status of the church and the impose of certain excise tax.\n\nPublication 1828 also discusses \u201cIndividual Activity by Religious Leaders.\u201d The IRS publication says that the prohibiting political campaign activity within these tax-exempt organization is not intended to restrict free speech on political matters for individuals. Religious leaders can speak their mind and endorse candidates as long as they aren\u2019t doing it as an official representative of the church(i.e. church publications or at official church functions).  When speaking/writing their opinions on political issues outside of the church, church leaders are urged to indicate that these are their personal viewpoints and not the views of the religious organization they represent.\n\n[Source](https://www.clergyfinancial.com/clarifying-the-irs-rules-about-endorsing-candidates-from-the-pulpit/)",

It's no more disgusting than charlatans using religion as a shield to run business empires and spread political hatred and ignorance.  \n\n> Freedom to exercise religion is the law  \n\nI don't know of anyone who wants to prohibit freedom of religion, just people who don't want slimy businessmen and charlatans to evade taxes by quoting the Bible.  \n\n> if you don't like the law, north korea will gladly take you in.  \n\n1.  Alternatively, if someone doesn't like the law, they can try to improve it.  At least in a democracy.  \n2.  Have you actually asked North Korea about this?  It doesn't seem like the kind of place that welcomes skeptics and free thinkers.  \n3.  If you want blind obedience to bizarre cults, maybe you should be the one looking to emigrate.
