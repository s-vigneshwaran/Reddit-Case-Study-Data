Are their comrades going to trade the fruits of success for a living wage and still make hand-held computers that cost $25/month with a phone plan?\n\nThese people have no clue how the supply chain works or how they get such a luxurious lifestyle at such an affordable price.\n\nSo... why don't they just move to North Korea instead?\n\nThey also want to topple \"Evil Big Pharma' which is ironic because half of them or more are reliant on psych meds just to be able to leave the house in the morning. And the far-left, who is crazy jab happy - is big pharma allowed so long as they make cancer treatments and COVID vaccines?\n\nThese people are not capable of critical thought.\n\nThey're just  young idiots indoctrinated by old Marxists and Communist ideologues in humanities programs who are selling them a spot in the Oppression Olympics line. Hey, why work hard when you can just aspire to the be the biggest, most oppressed victim out there. \n\nIt's pathetic.",

That's not why feminism isn't needed. It's not needed cause it doesn't take men and women into equal consideration and it often favors women's issues and rights above mens or even dismiss or ignore mens issues and rights all togheter. If feminism was about equality, then the discussion of mens issues should be equally as important as the discussion of women's issues, not only from a woman's perspective, but equally from both. Feminism isn't needed cause true egalitarianism or humanism is what is needed. Feminism is not about equality in my experience, but about mainly advancing women's rights.. even if it's at the cost of men. As someone who believes in true equality.. that doesn't sit right with me.",

In my view, identifying as a feminist just falls under the umbrella as an egalitarian - we need equality in all areas, including race, class etc. \n\n\u201cIt favours women\u2019s women\u2019s issues and rights above men\u2019s\u201d - that\u2019s only because men are societally above women, that\u2019s the problem. In most of the world men are valued over women and women experience the repercussions of that on a daily basis. As a feminist, I don\u2019t deny that men have issues, but they aren\u2019t societally oppressed like women are. Men\u2019s issues are largely due to the patriarchy, which feminism ofc wants to abolish - leading to a more equal society where men and women can both express their emotions, develop strong support systems etc, leading to less mental  health problems and suicides. Feminists don\u2019t dismiss men\u2019s problems, quite the contrary- we\u2019ve been very vocal for years about how important it is that we make it so men are able to express their feelings, be believed when they are victims of abuse etc. In order for true egalitarianism to be achieved, we need to dismantle the patriarchy, which is what feminism focuses on.

In most of the world men are valued over women and women experience the repercussions of that on a daily basis\n\nYeah but not all over the world like feminism and most feminists claims. That's an issue.\n\n>I don\u2019t deny that men have issues, but they aren\u2019t societally oppressed like women are.\n\nI disagree with that. Lots of men and women are socially oppressed in this world, especially in countries where poverty is common, so to say that men aren't is just flat out wrong. Try telling me a lot of men of color isn't socially oppressed and I won't be able to take you seriously.\n\n>Men\u2019s issues are largely due to the patriarchy, which feminism ofc wants to abolish - leading to a more equal society where men and women can both express their emotions, develop strong support systems etc, leading to less mental health problems and suicides.\n\nYeah I disagree that it's due to patriarchy. Why not just say that it's due to traditional gender roles, so at least we can partially agree. However, not all traditional gender roles are inherently or necessarily bad. They're there for a lot of natural reasons such as men and women's biological and physical abilities they're born with. Those abilities isn't something that can be abolished. How we view traditional gender roles can however be changed, but wanting to abolish traditional gender roles completely is not possible as long as men and women are born with inherent different abilities.\n\n>Feminists don\u2019t dismiss men\u2019s problems, quite the contrary- \n\nSo you're basically telling me the feminists that dismiss mens problems aren't true feminists. Neat. That's a huge portion of feminists I've come across who are not feminists then. Very odd.\n\n>we\u2019ve been very vocal for years about how important it is that we make it so men are able to express their feelings, be believed when they are victims of abuse etc.\n\nThat's all good that you as a feminist is vocal about it doesn't mean everyone who claims to be a feminist is vocal about it - quite the contrary \n\n> In order for true egalitarianism to be achieved, we need to dismantle the patriarchy, which is what feminism focuses on.\n\nThere's no patriarchy. There's just traditional gender roles due to our biological abilies. You can't completely dismantle traditional gender roles unless you can change our biological abilities. \n\n>Feminism solely focusing on gender isn\u2019t to say that no other specific demographics are oppressed- it\u2019s just that this movement focuses specifically on gender\n\nAnd that's specifically what men and women in this sub disagree with or take issue with: the one sided focus on women's issues and dismissal of mens issues.\n\n>and we need specific movements for each demographic that experiences oppression. It\u2019s all under the same umbrella\n\nSo you think there should be specific movements for men then? Most feminists is strongly opposed to MRAs and the existence of mens rights movements and even actively work against them.",

That's okay tho.\n\n>Sure, traditional gender roles came from our \u201cnatural biological differences\u201d - that\u2019s why women make better leaders than men\n\nI don't know. Some men make great leaders just as some women make great leaders just as some women don't and some men dont. I'm not gonna play the black and white game with you. I'm a woman myself and I absolutely hate leader positions at my work for instance. Now if we are talking about in general.. sure women may make better leaders in general, but so what? That doesn't mean there isn't some men who make better leaders than someone women. I prefer nuance over this black and white arguing that women are superior leaders to men. It isn't productive and it diminishes the fact that there's men who can make great leaders.\n\n>women have a larger frontal lobe than men, which is responsible for problem solving\n\nDoes that necessarily make men bad at problem solving? No of course not. There's plenty men who are great at problem solving. It seems like you're trying to prove that women are superior to men when the matter of the fact is that we have different strengths and weaknesses. Not all men or women fit into a box. I'm a woman who absolutely suck at problem solving, while my boyfriend is ridiculously good at it.\n\n>women outperform men in education\n\nAgain, what's your point? That women are superior? Men outperform women in other areas as well.. and vica versa, that's natural, unless men or women underperform due to some form of discrimination. There's also nuance here. There's men that also will outperform women in education. My brother far outperformed me in education for instance and graduated with far better grades than me.\n\n>Etc, but surely we\u2019re biologically designed to be lesser than men right? \n\nNo. Where did you get the idea that I think women are designed biologically lesser? \n\nWhat I think is simply that women are designed biologically *different* from men.\n\nI didn't say anything about those differences being lesser or greater. Women have their own inherent strengths and weaknesses just as men do, that's all. Nuance...",

Since women traditionally was pregnant and gave birth, it made sense for women to stay at home while men worked to provide for them.\n\nTraditional gender roles wouldn't exist if it weren't for mens and women's different biological abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Our society is shaped around our nature as human beings.\n\nNow, that's not to say that's not changing, our that our society can't or shouldn't necessarily adapt to different roles, but it does make sense why both men and women traditionally have taken on the roles they have, once you study history a bit and look at women's and mens different abilities.\n\nThe question we should be asking is not if traditional gender roles makes sense, generally speaking, but if they make sense presently or in the future? Personally I think that in some way shape or form as long as women are the only ones capable of giving birth, then yeah, they absolutely do make some form of sense. \n\nNo, you may not like that. I absolutely don't like it either which is why I'm childfree. I don't want the traditional role of the mother and nurturer myself, but as long as the majority of other women wants that.. then abolishing gender roles is going to be impossible and I truly believe that.\n\n>You said they come from our natural biological differences, so surely if that was the case then women would be the ones seen as logical, rational leaders, and men would be seen as the more emotional, irrational gender?\n\nNo? \n\nI was thinking more in terms of women's ability to give birth. It's women's ability and desire to give birth and nurture children and mens desire to provide for such children that reinforce traditional gender roles. \n\nGenerally men are born physically stronger than women, which makes them more fitting for physically taxing labor where as work that doesn't require a lot of physical strength will be more fitting for women. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is that underneath all these societal roles and structures, is our strengths, weaknesses and abilities that we are born with as individual men and women that are influencing the roles we take on. We aren't only influenced by the society we live in, but by the abilities we have due to our sex.\n\nUnless there's some way we all can become the same sex and are born with the same or similar biological abilities, outcomes between men and women Will never collectively be the same and the roles we have will continue to be influenced by the abilities we were born with due to our sex.\n\n>I mean look at the rates of men losing their shit and going and shooting up public places, or screaming and punching holes in walls etc, and yet society paints men as the ones more in control of their emotions compared to women.\n\nMen and women deal with losing their shit different ways. Personally I will verbally attack someone when I lose my shit and not physically hit someone. Neither men or women are necessarily better than the other at controlling their emotions in my experience. They just express it outwardly differently.\n\nAnyways, these are clearly mental health issues that deserves recognition and that people need help with, but unfortunately the access to get help with mental health issues remain poor and inaccessible.\n\n>My point wasn\u2019t to say that women are biologically superior, just that if traditional gender roles were based on anything factual, then they would be the other way around. \n\nSo gender roles just appeared out of nowhere for no reason? Yeah I don't think so. If women didn't give birth and was as physically strong as men then there'd be no gender roles.. cause they're essentially based on mens and women's biological abilities when it comes down to it.\n\nThis is precisely why I choose to never have children. By having children I reinforce traditional gender roles that will pigeonhole me into a caretaker role while my boyfriend will get pigeonholed into the main provider role since I'm the only one who can be pregnant give birth and breastfeed, I'd have to quit work and he would have to work.\n\nMeanwhile other women Will want to take on the traditional gender roles of parents. You can't erase traditional gender roles as long as men and women are born with different biological abilities like that and wants to choose to reinforce traditional gender roles by taking them on, aka be mother's and father's.\n\n>The reason that women are painted as over emotional, illogical and incompetent is to control us, as we live in a patriarchy which wants to suppress women as much as possible\n\nControl us? Huh? No one is controlling me. Maybe you live in a patriarchy but I don't. Last I checked, Norway wasn't a patriarchal society and you'd be hard pressed to make the society I or everyone else live in fit the definition of a patriarchy. No one is suppressing women where I live at all.",

By doing nothing, or actually OPPOSING feminism, you are part of the problem.\n\nWhy not throw gender out of picture and do something to support people who are treated like absolute shit ? I would go with that route. Surely that doesn't make me women hating and hence I am not a misogynist. \n\nAs for opposing feminism, when feminists become sexist and they fight against sexism, i am just pointing out the hypocrisy here. \n\nI am sure if there is something good about feminism, i would want that as well. Anything that helps make world a better place. \n\n> Society is never going to change unless everyone takes it seriously and the amount of men who see the word \u201cfeminism\u201d and think we want a matriarchy and to oppress men and automatically oppose it are a huge problem. \n\nBut there are already a lot of \"side effects\" for the privileges. Then there is also things like scum...\n\nPeople have also debated that the patriarchy and male dominated society is also a lie making the entire feminism philosophy fall flat on the face as that's what it's based on. \n\n> IMO complacency with the system we\u2019re in alone is enough to make someone a misogynist\n\nNot everyone is generous enough to fight for literally everyone. I will look for myself and feminism has only affected me negatively. Even if i try to see a bigger picture, both feminism and MRA present different pictures and hence people debate on it. \n\nI don't know how you just equate that to \"hating on women\". It's like people have twisted the definition to just put a \"label\" on someone.",

However, society pushes this narrative that men are biologically superior, I\u2019ve seen this argument so many times esp here on Reddit. There are so so so many men out there that genuinely believe women are just biologically inferior to men in every way, and will tear down successful women and claim they\u2019re only successful due to their looks, \u201csleeping their way to the top\u201d etc. I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t think like this, but you have to understand that this idea is so deeply ingrained into society that it subconsciously affects how society views women and therefore treats women. If you do an IAT about gender, it will show you your subconscious biases towards men- this affects everyone, even me, because the idea that women are just inferior is so prevalent. https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/user/agg/blindspot/indexgc.htm \n\n\u201cYour anger and hatred are palpable\u201d, I\u2019m angry yes because imagine society shitting on you constantly your entire life and you trying to correct the narrative is met with more belittling insults and being told I\u2019m just a stupid \u201cfeminazi\u201d who wants female supremacy when in reality I just want to be seen as equal to my male peers. You genuinely don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like being just as competent, if not moreso than others (men) but it being constantly perceived as not good enough because of subconscious biases towards men and my very valid, informed opinions on society (which I\u2019m literally educated on, I know what I\u2019m talking about) are all just dismissed because some neckbeard who\u2019s angry he can\u2019t get laid has convinced himself that women are actually privileged and men are oppressed because they don\u2019t have unlimited access to sex slaves or whatever- like you have to understand how infuriating this is. Of course I\u2019m angry, but that doesn\u2019t take away from what I\u2019m saying",

MEN are the ones who get the most out of everything, since society is literally catered to and built around you. Women in relationships still do the vast majority of the housework and child care, and are also expected to work full time jobs and emotionally take care of the family. WOMEN have been doing the vast majority of labour, it\u2019s just unpaid and unvalued. Men have been reaping the benefits of this set up since women got the right to work, and before then women were basically trapped in marriages since we weren\u2019t allowed to file for divorce or have our own bank accounts. Men have been profiting off of the labour of women this whole time, not the other way around. Women want EQUALITY. That\u2019s it. The fact that you think this way is literally so so so incredible to me, do you live under a rock?",

You don't think being forced to give birth is an issue? How about attempts to now block birth control? Its being lead by white supremacists because they are freaking out about not enough white babies are being born. Only its going to back fire on them as more privileged women are going to be able to go out of state. Poland and Iran have completely banned abortion and birth control.",

That is the feminist narrative to blame men for political capital, not reality. It is rural religious Republicans of both sexes. The majority of prolife voters in both Alabama and Texas were *women*. The Alabama bill was written by a female legislator and signed into law by a female governor when it didn't have a vetoproof majority. The Texas senate bill was written by a man, but the Texas house bill was written by a woman. In most countries, men support choice in \"most cases\" (e.g. first two trimesters or for clear medical need) more than women. Women make of the majority of \"never\" (e.g. prolife) as well as \"always\" (e.g. 39th week without medical need because its bodily autonomy for women to choose) groups.\n\nI layed it all out with sources last year.\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/phffry/men_are_not_taking_away_womens_abortion_rights/\n\n\nTry actually reading that my comments in this thread with an open mind if you really want to understand anti-feminists. The majority of us aren't anti-women. We are anti sexism/bigotry/propaganda.",

                              "text": "Most countries around the world use Mary Koss's methodology. Some are exceptions like Canada.\n\nFor statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)\n\nShe is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the \"victims\" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely \"unwanted contact\"** \n\nYou see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g. \n\nDetecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206\n\n> > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**\n\nSrc: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf\n\nShe is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.\n\nMost people talking about sexual violence refer to the \"rape\" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for \"made to penetrate\" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.\n\nAs an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm\n\n> **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**\n\nand\n\n> The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\n\nvs\n\n> **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**\n\nand \n\n> Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators\n**For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),\n\nSo if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of \"made to penetrators\" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**\n\nBut since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs \"only\" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group \"nearly all the men were raped by other men\" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...\n\nAnd before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.\n\n\n2010 survey results - \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf\n\n2012 survey results -\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\n2015 survey results - \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf\n\nScientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known\n\n*data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*\n\nAnd non CDC study...\n\n*A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*\n\nThe Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/\n\nAnother non CDC study...\n\n*a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*\n\nAnd another non CDC study...\n\n*National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had \u2018ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,\u2019 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.\u201d*\n\nTime - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers\n\n*when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d\u2014either by physical force or due to intoxication\u2014at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*\n\n\nIf my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/\n\nJust maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at \"rapists\", rather than \"men\".\n\nAnd it isn't just the US.  \n\nFeminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms\n\nSo a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.\n\nIsraeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.\n\nhttps://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape\n\nNepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...\n\n> Women\u2019s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn\u2019t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims\u2019 fight for justice.\n\nhttps://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities\n\n**Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.\n\nhttp://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528\n\nSo women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.  That *should* matter *if* the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men",

The US data shows the women most likely to be seriously injured in DV are those in mutually abusive relationships that initiated the physical violence. Significant injuries from one sided violence from men is the minority. Both men and women indicate that women perpetrate more one sided DV and strike first more often than men in mutually abusive relationships. I can tell you that the only times I knocked my wife on her ass was to *run* away when she was blocking my exit or digging her nails into my arm when I was trying to walk away from a physical fight she was started and was escalating. As long as I pay $300/mo for her to see a therapist, I'm not violent and the other three of us don't need a therapist. The US data shows I am not a rare case.",

More women said they hit first too, not just men saying that. \\#BelieveWomen \n\nOutside of the feminist world - Hitting first isn't defense. Killing/burning/castrating men when they are asleep isn't self defense. Those are perpetrating intimate partner violence regardless of the sexes of the participants.\n\nSpeaking of which, homosexual relationships have lower rates of DV than heterosexual ones in the US. Lesbian relationships however have significantly higher rates of DV. Ironically there are far more DV resources for gay men than heterosexual men in my state, because of there is funding for victims of men.",

It has nothing to do with feminists or feminism. The courts are male dominated by a huge margin. So, why aren't men doing anything about it?

Zero. Court ordered or otherwise. I looked. I anonymously inquired with our towns DV specialist police officer. The nearest she could find was 1500km away and met weekly...\n\nI'm paying for my wifes DBT so the rest of us are okay. We had a good relationship for 14 years. She was a top mom for three of those years. Then she was rejected by her birth mother after being raised by a narcissist mother. She snapped and there was a dramatic personality change over a few months. I believe any psychologist seeing what we saw would have diagnosed her. I had no idea what was going on. She only treated her closest friends and family like that. No one else would ever know. The things she did to us, especially when in dissociative rages, were certainly physical abuse. If our genders were reversed, she would have been sent to prison and I would have had full custody. But alas, the world doesn't work like that. I reached out for help and nothing was available to us because the abuser was the mother rather than the father. Both kids and I did over a year of individual therapy each. I dragged her to marriage counseling against her will. Our marriage counselor finally convinced her she had a problem. So far I have spent > $40k USD on combined therapist bills over this. That was the services available to me. Divorce would have cost me over $1m USD (more than I had) and left my kids primarily with their abuser. I was screwed because of feminist DV laws/policy/narrative/misleading statistics. That is how I educated myself about feminism. That is why I am an antifeminist. My kids had no resources because I wasn't their abusive parent.",

That doesn't say all women injured are perpetrators themselves, but it does indicate the problem goes beyond the feminist/pop culture model of \"violence against women\".\n\nIt includes:\n\n> Almost 25% of the people surveyed \u2014 28% of women and 19% of men \u2014 said there was some violence in their relationship. Women admitted perpetrating more violence (25% versus 11%) as well as being victimized more by violence (19% versus 16%) than men did. According to both men and women, 50% of this violence was reciprocal, that is, involved both parties, and in those cases the woman was more likely to have been the first to strike.\n\nRead that one again.  \\#BelieveWomen.\n\nSrc: https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/In_Brief_Domestic_violence_Not_always_one_sided\n\nor\n\nhttp://archive.is/7vuUz\n\n\nThis is a long meta study that shows we've known domestic violence isn't gendered for decades. It is good analysis. READ IT.  It summarizes the results of hundreds of studies across decades.  Not ONE study.  LOTS.\n\nhttps://connect.springerpub.com/content/sgrpa/1/3/332\nor the whole study here\nhttp://www.menweb.org/battered/StrausV78.pdf\n\n\nPopculture article - \n\nhttps://thedailycounter.com/male-victims-of-domestic-violence-are-they-ignored/\n\nMost domestic violence research today is research of \"violence against women\" from grants specifically looking for data on violence against women, not gender neutral research.\n\n\nAll that is very much against the feminist narrative that domestic violence is men beating women.\n\n\nThe rates of partner homicides didn't used to be that far apart. Then women got help and resources and the rate they killed their husbands dropped a lot. Men didn't get DV shelters they could use to protect their kids from their abuser without getting kidnapping charges giving the abuser an upper hand in custody, government funded help to allow them to get easy restraining orders, DV intervention public policy and programs that favored them, etc. Therefore the rate that husbands kill their wives hasn't dropped much. Maybe if we want to eliminate the desperate husbands in mutually abusive relationships killing their wives, we should give them better options. That would probably save a lot of women's lives just like doing it for women has saved a lot of mens lives.\n\n\"Gender Differences in Patterns and Trends in U.S. Homicide, 1976\u20132015\" by James Alan Fox and Emma E. Fridel. The data comes from FBI statistics (\"FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports, SHR\").\n\nhttps://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/vio.2017.0016?journalCode=vio&\n\nHere's part of the conclusion that the authors came to:\n\n> Among all the results already reported, perhaps the most striking and important surrounds the trends in intimate partner homicide, particularly in the context of ongoing efforts to curtail domestic violence. Some researchers argue that the reduction in male intimate partner victimization, a decline of nearly 60% over the past four decades, is because of an increase in the availability of social and legal interventions, liberalized divorce laws, greater economic independence of women, as well as a reduction in the stigma of being the victim of domestic violence. Although at an earlier time a woman may have felt compelled to kill her abusive spouse as her only defense, she now has more opportunities to escape the relationship through means such as protective orders and shelters (Dugan et al. 1999; Fox et al. 2012). As a tragic irony, the wider availability of support services for abused women did not appear to have quite the intended effect, at least through the 1980s, as only male victimization declined.\n\nHere is a graph of intimate partner homicides by sex over the years from the study. Notice the trend for women as they got help vs men that didn't?\n\nhttps://m.imgur.com/a/6Hx9dJt\n\nGod forbid we help men, even if it would save womens lives. The reason women need these resources and men don't is because more men kill their partners. Non-abusive women need to be taught to fear men. We need more one sided services ... if you are a feminist.  Anti-feminists consider maybe we should help men too.\n\n\n\n\nI also suggest you look into the feminist Duluth Model of Domestic Violence Intervention which results in men being beaten by their wives being arrested more often than the perpetrator when they call the police for help.\n\nEllen Pence (The creator) herself has written,\n\n> \"By determining that the need or desire for power was the motivating force behind battering, we created a conceptual framework that, in fact, did not fit the lived experience of many of the men and women we were working with. The DAIP staff [...] remained undaunted by the difference in our theory and the actual experiences of those we were working with [...] It was the cases themselves that created the chink in each of our theoretical suits of armor. Speaking for myself, I found that many of the men I interviewed did not seem to articulate a desire for power over their partner. Although I relentlessly took every opportunity to point out to men in the groups that they were so motivated and merely in denial, the fact that few men ever articulated such a desire went unnoticed by me and many of my coworkers. Eventually, we realized that we were finding what we had already predetermined to find.\"\n\nI suggest you read the Overview section of Erin Pizzey's wikipedia page or one of her books. She was the founder of Refuge. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Pizzey\n\nShe created the worlds first domestic violence shelters. After opening several for women in the UK, she suggested that men were being abused too (often by women staying in her shelters) and men needed a shelter too. She was then slandered, her kids were threatened, her dog was killed, bricks were thrown through her windows, and she was removed from the DV organization she founded (now known as Refuge which has just recently lost funding for harming male victims for decades). She fled the country for her childrens safety and became an outspoken DV activist and anti-feminist once they moved out on their own.\n\nThat's what happens when a DV advocate tries to help men.\n\nIn the US, VAWA replaced the gender neutral Family Violence Prevention and Services Act giving extra rights/services to women and taking services/rights away from men and children. The funding and laws became very gendered. Many of the laws in the act were challenged in court and had to be rewritten. The funding is still very gendered 25 years later, so... We have lots of grants to study \"violence against women\" rather than gender neutral domestic violence, lots of grants to develop separate programs to \"teach men not to rape\" and \"teach women to report rape\", lots of perpetrator intervention programs for men but none for women, lots of DV resources for women but almost none for men.",

Rape, sexual assault, statutory rape, fraud, forgery, theft, etc.\n\n\nAfter [Hermesmann v Seyer] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermesmann_v._Seyer) set the precedent, courts around the country have decided that male victims of women owe the perpetrators child support for decades, while other precedents (Roe v Wade) and laws (safe haven laws) generally allow female victims many options to get rid of the product of their rapes.\n\n> Hermesmann successfully argued that a woman is entitled to sue the father of her child for child support even if conception occurred as a result of a criminal act committed by the woman.\n\nE.g.\n\nAlabama man - https://law.justia.com/cases/alabama/court-of-appeals-civil/1996/2950025-0.html\n\nArizona boy - https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/09/02/statutory-rape-victim-child-support/14953965/\n\nCalifornia boy - https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-12-22-9612220045-story.html\n\nOthers in this paper \"Victims with responsibilities\" -https://lawpublications.barry.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=cflj\n\nThere are many others out there. I do not believe there has yet been a single case where a boy or man has gotten out of paying child support to an adult woman that statutory raped, raped, sperm jacked, etc.\n\nThe good news is that in recent years feminist lobbiests have pushed for laws to prevent rapists from getting child custody. Without custody the child wouldn't be raised by a rapist and the victim wouldn't owe child support. So the day that a male doesn't owe his perpetrator may be coming soon. The less good news is that just over half the states that passed these laws passed them as the feminist lobbiests proposed them - only preventing rapist **fathers** from getting custody. (https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/parental-rights-and-sexual-assault.aspx)\n\nTerrell v Torres recently set a precedent and invalidated a signed contract to let a woman use embryos created with her ex and have him owe child support. \n\nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2019/03/18/arizona-court-ruling-use-preserved-embryos-without-ex-husbands-consent-ruby-torres/3205867002/\n\nCourts have ruled the same way in Illinois and the US supreme court agreed.\n\nhttp://www.fathers4equality-australia.org/fathers-rights/woman-wins-custody-of-embryos-after-separation/\n\nCourts have ruled the same way in a very similar situation in Italy.\n\nhttps://www.ansa.it/canale_saluteebenessere/notizie/lei_lui/vita_di_coppia/2021/02/25/si-allimpianto-dellembrione-dellex-marito-anche-se-lui-dice-no_05230156-95ea-406a-aa7e-4e90cf2d7c93.html\n\nCourts ruled the same way in yet another similar case in Israel.\n\nhttps://he.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%AA_%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%99\n\nIn several other cases women who forged her ex's signature to implant have been awarded child support from the unwilling father. E.G. https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5687477/Ex-husband-ordered-pay-child-support-former-wife-forged-signature-undergo-IVF.html\n\n\nReproductive coersion of men is also an issue that would be drastically reduced with financial abortion.\n\n> approximately 10.4% (or an estimated 11.7 million) of men in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_coercion\n\nAmerican talk shows for women encourage women to stop birth control without telling their partner with the applause of their audiences.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=5CNHwhHWPoQ\n\nWhat about IVF with sperm taken from a condom without the man's consent?\n\nhttps://www.mommyish.com/woman-steals-ex-boyfriends-sperm-has-twins-sues-for-child-support-836/\n\nHow about when they only engage in oral sex which should have no pregnancy risk?\n\nhttps://rollingout.com/2014/02/04/woman-uses-sperm-oral-sex-get-pregnant-force-man-pay-child-support/\n\nHow about court orders mandating men give their wife sperm so they can impregnate themselves during divorce proceedings?\n\nhttps://theprint.in/judiciary/court-orders-man-to-donate-sperm-to-estranged-wife-who-says-no-time-for-2nd-marriage/255215/\n\nFinancial abortion would solve all the financial issues for victimized males and remove financial incentives for women to do these things, **but** many pro-choice folks immediately start making pro-life talking points that if he didn't want a kid he should have used a condom or kept it in his pants.  \n\n**Financial abortion is about bodily autonomy.** No out for child support forces a man to spend years of his life working to pay for a child he does not want. If he loses his job and is unable to pay, he will be locked in a cage.\n\n1 in 8 men in South Carolina jails are there for failure to pay child support. They are not given court appointed lawyers until they are $10k behind and most are arrested and lose their job way before that limit making it extremely difficult to pay.\n\nSrc: https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/20/us/skip-child-support-go-to-jail-lose-job-repeat.html\n\nIn the US,\n\n> 66 percent of all child support not paid by fathers is due to an inability to come up with the money\n\nSrc: https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-myth-of-the-deadbeat-_b_4745118\n\nMothers owing child support are more likely to not pay fathers than visa versa, but women are rarely jailed for it.\n\n> we found that 32 percent of custodial fathers didn't receive any of the child support that had been awarded to them compared to 25 percent of custodial moms\n\nSrc: https://www.npr.org/2015/03/01/389945311/who-fails-to-pay-child-support-moms-at-a-higher-rate-than-dads\n\nBut women aren't sent to jail at nearly the same rates for failure to live up to their obligations.\n\n> Based on national data, if incarceration for non-payment of child support occurred at equal rates for men and women who are in arrears, 88% of those incarcerated would be men, not 95% to 98.5%, and 12% would be women (since 12% of those in arrears are women). If, as Brennan\u2019s report shows, as few as 1.5% of those incarcerated for non-payment of child support in Massachusetts are women, instead of the expected 12%, then women in arrears are incarcerated at a rate eight times less than their numbers warrant.\n\nSrc: https://pjmedia.com/drhelen/2013/03/15/women-who-fail-to-pay-all-of-their-child-support-are-incarcerated-only-one-eighth-as-often-as-men-with-similar-violations-n130850",

As you can see, vasectomy, male condoms, and any future male pill or vasogel is explicitly not covered.\n\nWe opted for the safer, simpler, more reliable, lower cost, lower risk of complications vasectomy. It cost us a $1k deductible, while my wife could have gotten a riskier, more complicated, less reliable, higher cost, higher risk of complications tubal for free.

The vast majority believe that men and women have equal value and that people shouldn't be held back from careers and hobbies on the basis of gender.\n\nWe recognised this and stopped calling ourselves \"feminist\" because it wasn't meaningful to wear a label which identified you as believing what almost everyone else also believed.\n\nThe thing this quote misses is that the people who held on to the label \"feminist\" didn't believe in the user-friendly definition. They are the people who still need a label to distinguish them from the norm. They believe in an oppressor-oppressed model of gender relations where all men must spend the rest of eternity begging women for forgiveness.",

      "text": "Well, it simply follows the actual definition of feminism, which is unisex by virtue. It seeks equality between genders both legally and practically; nationally and internationally. So, yeah, if you are against that you are a sexist by virtue. Of course, the problem is how people define feminism and how sexist some loud so called feminists can be. They often get reactionary responses that are counterproductive to equality and freedom. But opposing feminism without seeking equality and the end of sexism is not only sexist but frankly... Bad. Bad bad. I haven't yet found a men's rights movement that makes any sense to me, tbh. I would support it if it insisted on that feminism is for all and therefore should be a unisex word, for instance. We need concord and agreement as humans. We are talking about half the population against the other half. Thankfully, feminism hasn't spread so it's just some radical folk against some radical folk. \n\nEdit: let's define equality too! The other day I argued with a female friend of mine. She said it was her objective to have roughly as many women and men in parliament. I agree but insist that statistics doesn't work that way and that would only cap the possibility of having even more women in a free system. What's equal for me? Divide humanity in any 2 random groups a million times. You won't probably ever get a 50-50% arrangement. Then do the average of that. Them divide humanity in genders. Does it much? How much it doesn't? Even if the division in genders isn't totally random, you'll get a pretty good idea of what inequality does exist and what's essentially artificial in that inequality. That target I'd support it. And it eventually takes you to having a fair parliament, tbh.  Which by the way guys... Not sure if you've noticed but it doesn't fucking exist! There's one in Rwanda I think, due to a genocide. You can't call yourself democratic folk and yet say sexism is over or that there's no patriarchy unless you don't totally understand the meaning of those words, frankly.",
