  "text": "TIFU by going to a supermarket chain and admitting I shoplifted for ~2years\nFor my last 4semesters of uni i was shoplifting at a supermarket chain here in germany. I felt bad for doing so, thats why i always wrote up what i stole in my google keep app. last sunday i spent the whole day putting it all together in a huge excel file and thought to myself that, now that i have a good paying job (since august) - i can pay it back! i even stayed at the little apartment im in so i can put the money aside faster than if i had moved. so today i went to an atm and got the cash i needed to (only 971 euros, i was surprised how low the amount was) and went to the supermarket where i stole from with it. i told a woman who was putting stuff up the shelves' if i could see the manager, she asked why and i said i had shoplifted. she got me into this room and asked me to wait and that he'll be here. when he got here i told him about everything, with the printed out excel and the money. he told me that he didnt realise that it was me who was stealing it, they have caught some shoplifters but still saw the inventory not adding up. he was thankful and asked me to wait. i waited for like half an hour, kind of anxiously but also relieved. he came back with 2 policemen who repeated my story and asked me if it was true. i was a bit hesitent but the manager said that the conversation had been recorded. i said yes and basically they made me sign all these forms acknowledging what i did. now im looking towards jailtime and losing my job.\n\nTL;DR\n\nshoplifted for 2years due to money problems, told the store about it today, looking to lose my new job i got due to my degree and facing jailtime aswell",

          "text": "Yup.  Maybe supermarkets are smaller in Germany, but I've worked at a couple in the US and inventory is always off.  Shrink is a matter of reduction, not elimination, because it cannot be eliminated.  Pulling out of dates can be recorded wrong or not at all, stuff falls under the gondolas, items get stored in a weird place in the backroom and not counted, etc.  So, given my own experience, the manager having his thumb on the inventory to such a degree to know specifically shoplifting is happening is questionable.",

That\u2019s not necessarily all theft, it\u2019s also misplaced, miscounted, etc but the point is a fairly large retailer not flinching at losing $300k at one store x2300 stores makes OP stealing ~$500/yr a fraction of a drop in the bucket. That\u2019s probably why the manager on his own wouldn\u2019t care much and even appreciate the effort to repay, but had to call the police per policy.",

The society/system in turn should understand that. The police will be involved? Yes, why not? If the system works that\u2019s what you would expect: for it to be working. Police shouldn\u2019t be there just to \u201cthrow you in jail hahaha\u201d. I think when you think about crime and punishment things go much deeper than that.

People trying to do the right thing in all sides of this.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t eliminate the need for a lawyer. You need someone to represent your side of the story well, navigate the judicial system and make things right. Details get lost, and the devil in the details.\n\nWishing you good luck OP!",

In the state I live in any theft under $1000 would be a misdemeanor, and even if the total were above that it would be counted as multiple charges for each instance.

I am a highly ethical person who has never stolen or cheated, who would turn people in for stealing, and think the whole \"don't snitch\" culture is despicable. BUT, when I applied for this job, which I was tentativelky offered, I also had to take a \"test\". Some of the questions in this test were about whether I would report someone for \"stealing a loaf of bread if he came back and added money to the til the next week after he got paid, but was desperate for food now.\" Well, it was multiple choice, yes or no. And I chose no. Because ethics are not that black and white to me, and there are other things I would do before reporting this person, like talking to them privately, insisting they never steal again, and offering to buy the bread for them.  \n\n\nMy whole family was shocked when I *failed* this ethics test and the job offer was withdrawn. because the corporation absolutely does not tolerate  theft, period. Corporations are not human, they have strict policies, and that's it.  A small business or charity of some sort might feel much more empathetic, but a big corporation, doubt it.",

The store probably \"shrinks\" in terms of loss from expired goods more than they stole.

But convicting them of a crime and making them lose their means of paying any restitution is not what most would call justice.  In a more fair world, maybe they would've been taken to the precinct to file everything and then given a fine + have to pay restitution (the amount stolen + interest). Jail time and losing their job doesn't teach a great lesson.  It tells the world:  \"It doesn't matter your situation, if you steal - you will be punished to the full extent of the law.  So, if you do the crime - don't ever confess or try to make it right.\"  Great life lesson that I'm sure will benefit society, right?",

              "text": "That \"it's not going to break them\" mentality always pisses me off. It does depend on the company, but for the one I work for that loss has to be made up by selling roughly 5,000 items. My company works on selling in higher volume at lower profit margins to pass the savings onto the customer, so loss is felt more strongly. That's roughly $10,000 - $20,000 we have to sell to break even on that loss.\n\nAs for the expired food bit... We throw away food that is no longer considered safe for human consumption as per food safety laws. This food that gets thrown out is likely contaminated by foreign objects or hasn't been sold within its allotted safe zone time frame. Believe me when I say we try to minimize this as much as possible. We do our best to keep this at less than 1% of daily sales. If we allowed people to take this food for free, as is often suggested, it would likely lead to a great many cases of people getting food borne illnesses. Sadly as well, if we offer discounts on prepared food close to it's pull time, it actually increases waste as people learn these times and stop buying when those times approach.\n\nIf it's \"expired\" we donate it to locals charities. Technically those are \"best by\" dates, not expiration dates. The product is often still fine and safe to eat although it may not taste as fresh anymore. Typically most people can't tell if they're eating food that's past the \"best by\" date.\n\nBut yes, admitting to the crime is still a crime. Some managers are cool and appreciate what you would have done. I have a feeling my manager would be one of those guys. But for anybody else in this situation, just buy over of the stores gift cards and cut it up. The money is back in the companies hands and you remain anonymous.",

So no, honestly that's not a great way to think of it at all.\n\nEdit: to address the real point here, stealing with no intention of paying it back should still definitely be a crime.

For example, you shoot someone is self defense, the cops ask what happened, you say \"he pulled a gun on me and said he was going to kill me!\" Cop says, \"Wow it sounds like he had it coming!\" You say, \"I agree he had it coming\" boom you just incriminated yourself by implying they deserved to die (in legal terms it is called \"Denial of victim\") and can be used against you in court.  Detectives are masters at getting people to incriminate themself. The right thing to do here is call 911, tell them the location and say \"There has been a self defense shooting\" then shut up. Call your lawyer and have them meet you at the police station and don't talk to the police without the lawyer next to you. If you get stopped at a DUI checkpoint, and they ask if you had any drinks and you say \"Yeah I had a couple beers a few hours ago\" you just caught yourself a DUI charge. You DON'T have to talk to any cop, simply close your mouth and don't say a word.   As far as lying if you end up lying to a federal agent you are going to prison for a long time. Look up Reality Winner's case. \n\nNEVER TALK TO THE POLICE. It's that simple.",

That's like 2000 bucks on Jacky Coke a year alone. And that's not even our most stolen item (I think that one's Red Bull at about 300-400 cans/3 months or so in terms of pure quantity)\n\nHell, even with some security dude in the back we had people walk out with carts roughly 300-400\u20ac worth of shit because the dude in the back was looking at someone else. It just happens, absolutely no way to prevent it, you can just curb it somewhat.\n\nLike if I had to guess, we're roughly losing roughly 500-1000 bucks a month and that's not including employees whatsoever because half of us are prolly carrying out shit worth 50-100 bucks a week as well lmao",

I\u2019ve witnessed how our punishment-based justice system had only made their lives and recovery more challenging, as they practically were ostracized from society and were consequently more motivated to use. I\u2019ve seen my loved ones slowly decay from a total lack of societal support and empathy \u2014 some of them, including my parents, now dead from overdoses. \n\nI was of course very angry as a victim of theft, but my overall response has always been empathetic towards them. Many other family members and *total strangers* lives by this example too; all of us rarely got the police involved. If someone even went out of their way to apologize to me, why would I not at least attempt to forgive them? What kind of person does that to the people who are suffering?\n\nBut no, the real theft occurred when my tax dollars were used to keep nonviolent people imprisoned for stupid s**t.",

It was a huge risk to do what they did, regardless of the morals of the store manager, who btw was just doing their job. For all we know their boss would have fired them for accepting the money and not pressing charges. This is the real world and the actions you take can have consequences.

Treating people with dignity & respect (which encapsulates empathy) is different than enforcing lesser punishment over wealth and power. The latter would be, uh\u2026 corruption.\n\nOverall, your point of view is entirely based on enforcing punishment. I believe in restorative resolutions, just as u/Disgruntled_AnCap commented.

Trying to navigate blindfolded where everyone else can see, ending up whiplashed between blindly trusting, and then remembering belatedly not to when it's too late. Or thinking you shouldn't when you should because you've remembered you shouldn't. You'll wonder if you can trust people you should actually trust, because you don't know, you can't tell, and your heart may be a stupid, trusting puppy but you also keep getting your teeth kicked in.

From what I can find it looks like they have to post a sign saying they are recording.  Beyond the sign there is a bunch of rules about not being allowed to record public spaces, your neighbors and so on.  I'm guessing the Amazon door camera would be a pain to set up there.",

Seriously though, give evidence of financial struggle and any depression or mental health that came with it in court and you should be okay, You did the right thing, you were just naive in thinking other people would believe you. As you can see from this post, some people have been trained by society to think that criminals are evil and these poor, hopeless corporations will fall and people will suffer if you shoplift a frozen pizza, so unless the security guard was genuinely under threat of losing his job, he probably got you arrested out of spite, sadly.

You think he was gonna flip that to do meth ?\n\nWe, the employees, would actually give these people food and water. We could just use the stuff we were going to throw out the earliest and write it off. They got to eat, and our numbers wouldn't change. The company was honestly extremely generous compared to a place like Walmart or something. \n\nHowever, i saw plenty of \"homeless\" people beg for food, come back to return it, and then purchase cigarettes and booze.... It kinda sucks when most of the people we saw begging for food really just wanted the money for other stuff. We had a policy that we'd refund anything under $20 just to not create a scene. \n\n>It's certainly an efficient model, but nasty AF to both you and the community.\n\nI thought it was pretty good. Doing a good job was usually rewarded, and we donated a ton of food whenever it was going out soon. \n\n\n>You're pissed at people who steal, because your boss refused to eat the cost of business like everyone fucking else, and instead put it on your shoulders.\n\nIt feels like you haven't been reading\n\n>Does he trains all his employees in security ?\n\nWe had armed security at plenty of stores. I've seen multiple people die at work. Usually customers shooting customers. We had rioters burn the place to the ground and try to trap my colleagues inside. Wasting time on every moron stealing wasn't worth possibly missing the guy with a piece in his waistband\n\n>Or is that not a thing where you live ?\n\nWhich pointless argument are you even referring to here?",

You just ask a place that's closing if you can have the expired food which is going to be thrown out. Grab yourself some food, and leave. It's just food that'll expire soon. Some places even throw out food nearly a week or more before it'll go bad. \n\n>Just admit you are so mad because you didn\u2019t do it and can\u2019t stand anyone not giving a fuck about that.\n\nWhat are you even on about?

You are an inherently good person.\n\nWhen my kid was about 6 he was in the habit of leaving my side in shops and raiding the bulk candy section. He would generally take a couple of gummy worms or something and walk around eating them on the sly. One day, after repeated warnings, I caught him and took him to the security guard in order to teach him a lesson. I thought I was on the same level with the security guard and that he would tell the kid it was wrong and that he would be watching. Probem solved and our honesty and willingness to face up to what had been done would be a lesson well remembered. Recall, I have allready been telling the kid for years it (shoplifting) is wrong and the reasons why it is so. This is when all around us people are doing the same thing and other dishonest things like picking a kilo of avacodos and pressing the button for potatos on the supermarker pricing scale.\n\nAnyway, the renta-cop puts us into a room and calls the police and proceeds to lock us in the room in back of the store. 2 hours later the police show-up - I am at the end of my rope and my kid has been struck into a psychosis by the sequence of events. Its not made easier by the fact that we can hear him talking to the staff members and telling them that the shoplifters are apprehended and GET THIS - he is \"de-escelating the situation\" and he has notified his contacts in the police and they are coming.\n\nKid is frantic and I am thinking I might have damaged him for life by trying to teach him a lesson about life. I am also shitting myself.\n\nCops show up - I tell them the story, they run out to their car and get a cap, a t-shirt, some pens and some other stuff and give it to my son. THey tell me behind closed doors that the guard is one of those guys who has roughed up people, acts like a cop when hes not working as a security guard and all kinds of weird stuff.\n\nI didnt f%&k up except for the fact that my kid now wants to be a cop and thinks that security guards \"need better training and people to be friends with...\"\n\nNeither did you fuck up by being honest. In general, good intentions will get good results - or at least satisfactory results. Your outcome will be no different",

There are degrees, but it doesn't really add much good to the world, so it's morally neutral at best (unless you're like Robin Hood and distributing those stolen goods to the poor).\n\nMe personally, I don't care about shoplifting from Walmart in a consequential sense, but since I do have a general anti-thievery position, I would just personally feel bad. I would be like OP and want to pay them back (though I'd likely be persuaded out of it by my fear of things like the story in the original post). I wouldn't want to get them their money back because I think they're about to go under, it's because I'd feel bad for taking from the system for free what others have to pay for. I don't care much for Walmarts profits, but what about the sales tax that I missed out on having to pay, and got out of contributing to our public funds? There are a lot of reasons that a person may feel guilty.",

Personally I'd high-five myself for having been able to steal 971 euro's from some immoral chain, but you felt guilt; should've payed of that guilt by gifting the money to someone who needed it. Not only have you gifted the money back to the chain which will only use it to make more money; you allowed yourself to get reported to the police on top of that.\n\nI feel for you, I do. Your honesty is a rare kind(I don't possess it). And that's something to be proud of. But let this be a lesson to all people who shoplift: If you ever feel guilty; pay off your guilt. But don't pay-off the shop(unless it's a one-man shop), give the money to some homeless guy or something. Never ever repay a big-chain-shop; they'll only report you.",

I definitely used to be quite naive and this is something I might have done, although I've never stolen anything.\n\nI can guess at your thought process. It was probably along the lines of, you need to eat, but you couldn't afford it. You figured you would eventually pay the store back, and make it right. If you do something wrong, you own up to it, right? I feel like that would work in a world where everybody is honest and also maybe one that wasn't run entirely by corporations. If it was a small mom and pop store, I could see that kind of thing might actually work. But the store you went to is likely run by a large corporation that has strict theft policies. You went into the store and admitted, likely in view of a camera, that you had been stealing. If the store manager did not report that as per policy, there's a good chance they would have lost their own job.\n\nI've actually seen people who forgot they had an item in their bag or under their cart and walked out of the store with it, discouraged from going back in and trying to pay for it, because there's a chance that some overzealous store manager or cop might decide to make an example out of you. That is the kind of thing that happens in the world we live in. It's really unfortunate, because you probably took the item out of the store by accident in that case, and as soon as you realized, while you were still in the parking lot, you took it back and intended to pay for it, but the people who are in charge of dealing with that don't see it that way.\n\nGood luck with everything.",

Your lawyer would have just assumed that the store had already been tracking the loss and were already trying to figure out who or what was going on and straight told this to you without you spending any money.  Your heartfelt guilt in doing what you did, and the subsequent noble though naive reaction is commendable.  But, no one cares.  You could have easily \u201cgotten away with it\u201d.  I do feel bad you may go to jail for this, but hopefully your forthright behavior will help a bit.  Consult your family and friends before making weird decisions like this.  Weigh your options.  Make a pro/con list. Never jump off the boat like you just have.  Your friends and family or co-workers or whomever is around you at the time can most certainly clear some things up.

If supermarket had theft issues that were big enough to put the manager on a hot seat or trigger a hunt for shoplifters, it's not a dude stealing less than 500 bucks per year who would be the problem.\n\nTo me, the manager's talk sounds like usual scare tactics for the poor sod who gets caught shoplifting (or who's too honest/remorseful and turns himself in)",

It seems like a nice symbolic gesture, but why are we then just accepting the fact that he stole all these products? Couldn't he himself have applied for the foodbank/other help instead if he was that poor?\n\nI understand the situation and OP's ultimately good intentions of making amends in the end, but what if he had a major financial setback and wouldn't have been able to pay the \u20ac971 after all? Would he just have kept stealing? Would we all be okay with the stealing even though there are mostly systems in place in countries like Germany, to assist poor people? \n\nMost commenters in this thread - me included - view OP as a generally good person, because he felt guilty and seemed to have the intention all along to pay back the store. I find it kind off indefensible though that someone purposefully stole from a store (corporation or not) for this long. It wasn't a bad week or a bad month. It was two years. I feel like there might have been better options that maybe were not chosen because of pride or shame. I get the same vibe as with this example of a small business owner who avoids paying taxes for two years due to a personal financial setback. Will it hurt the government? No. Will it hurt another person financially? Probably not. Is it therefore okay? Of course not. Because if every otherwise well-behaved business owner would do this, the system would crumble, and people would actually get hurt unfairly. So for me, I can commend the fact that OP wanted to make it right, but I also support that there are consequences in this instance.\n\nI kind can understand the other side too, since OP has been and could've gotten away with it easily and nobody would've gotten hurt in the end, but for me it's a matter of principle really.",

Maybe. Actually no. You said this was a chain store. While that doesn't make it any less wrong to steal from them, this is known as \"shrink\" and is basically predicted and accounted for.\nYou got away with a crime. Then you confessed to said crime along with exact details to make prosecuting you a cinch.\nYou should come on over to the United States! Commiefornia specifically. No need to do it legally, that's for suckers. Just say something something about being a \"climate refugee\" snd fleeing \"systemic racism\". You'll feel right at home in California with the electricity shortages and ridiculous gasoline prices.\nAnd the best part? You can steal about as much as you did over the last 2 years in Germany in a single trip to the store!

I realize that this is wrong, and it's haunted my conscience the entire time.  Now that I have the money available, I'd like to try to make you whole for your loss.  \n\nI understand that you may wish to see me prosecuted; but I can't hope to begin a new life that doesn't involve stealing food to stay alive if I have a criminal record.  This is a bit selfish on my part, but your loss to this point has been small and covered by insurance.  I have no intention of causing you any further trouble, and regret any shortfall that this has caused in your life and business.  \n\nPlease accept the enclosed 971 euros along with my sincere apologies.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJean Valjean\"",

      "text": "When i was 5 i stole a Barbie doll in a supermarket (i mean the Barbie was out of the packaging anyway so it's not even really stealing i guess). I spent YEARS feeling guilty after that, any time i thought of it my stomach hurt out of guilt, i wouldn't even have fun with it because it reminded me that i had stolen. I remember thinking regularly that when i would be old enough i would go to the supermarket by myself and pay it back. I was giving myself a hard time trying to remember the exact price of the doll and the supermarket's name, when i didn't i hoped i would remember it someday.\nWell one day i realised a big supermarket chain didn't need the few euros my Barbie doll cost (even if it probably didn't cost anything since it was out of the packaging) and certainly didn't deserve the guilt of a 5 year-old. I was absolutely relieved when i understood that, but i also felt kind of stupid for having been feeling that way for so long over that...\nAnyway, as i was reading the post i felt like you shouldn't have felt guilty for stealing from a supermarket chain, but i was honestly shocked by the reaction they had, i mean what kind of people is that. I'm so sorry for you OP, they didn't deserve your honesty or your guilt.",

If you don't go to jail there is no reason to lose your job. If you need to take off for court stuff just make up some medical reason excuse that you can use more than once. You don't necessarily have to give a specific medical reason but find a way to make it sound genuine. Sadly you will have to do some lying to your new employer because you tried to tell the truth. If can't lie without sounding sketchy or they already know hopefully the place you got hired isn't uptight. I think most decent people will be sympathetic to your situation. Being poor shouldn't be a crime and trying to make things right may be naive but it's not something that would make me want to fire someone. Learn from this experience and take your lumps. The lesson here isn't that you can't live a good and moral life. It's that you can do it without screwing yourself. Giving back the money to clear your conscience and square your debt is one thing but confessing to petty crimes like this helps no one. Doing the right thing isn't about some strict code of behavior it's about doing right by people. Sometimes taking responsibility for crimes is the right thing to do. Like if you hit and run and killed someone. Confessing so the family can get closure and justice is morally right. But the supermarket isn't looking for closure, they are just trying to run a profitable business. This too shall pass, keep your chin up.\n\nEdit: If you need to lie, the less you say the better. Get a decent lawyer.",

For reference, small government welfare budgets typically are in the hundreds of billions, walmart is the best case and they operate on like a 15 billion / year profit, the entire global company, when single governments spend many times that, hell, that kind of money is even affordable to the entire third world.\n\nSo in order for them to solve world hunger they would need to go on a MASSIVE infrastructure building spree across the developing world, this would run into the TRILLIONS very quickly.

No, they took the drugs and then THEY committed the crime. They weren't being MADE to do anything by anyone or anything.\n\nPersonal responsibility is important, and separating oneself from those responsibilities is not only harmful to societies as a whole, but to the individuals who do it.\n\nI'll totally admit though that my opinion on this is definitley impacted by my experiences with people I've known (and loved) who have been through or are still going through these kinds of struggles.\n\nIt just grinds my gears to hear that's it's okay they robbed someone because \"they were strung out, they wouldnt have done that if sober\". Or it's okay they dropped the ball on a project because \"they had too much to drink last night\". \n\nNo, it's not okay to begin with, and ecspecially not okay because they are abusing substances.",

If you don't have a criminal account yet, you might get away with a slap on your wrist, which could range from a fine to probation. Also, the age, you committed the thefts at is highly relevant. German law allows for trial as a minor  (14-18)or \"Heranwachsender\" youth from 18-21, if the court thinks your maturity was that of a minor, at the times of the crime. Also, confessing your crimes and owning up to them lke you did, must be considered at the sentencing.\n\nAbout your job however I don't know. You actually might lose it, or be restricted to do it. But, this is not the end. Your honesty will not be your fate and a lawyer will help you limiting the damages. What you did was honorable, even though you put yourself in trouble with it.",

It has to go through accounting and be reconciled to the products sold that day. So the manager was probably concerned for their job if they just took it, so wanted to record it properly,  which of course means reporting the crime.\n\nNow after my observations, my advice: get a lawyer. You want to try and get the supermarket to drop the charges if they can. Often they have a policy of always prosecuting, in the UK anyway. You have to make your case special. Also consider telling your local newspaper about it so they can report it. This could put some pressure on the supermarket, but even if not and you are convicted,  it might mean you have a news story you can link to explain yourself to employers etc. Talk to.the lawyer first though.",

I didn't have any money to repay them, but told them I was sorry and just wanted to change my ways.  The Walmart manager did not seem impressed with my change of heart to say the least.  Fortunately for me there was no jail time involved.  \n\nI don't know how the system works in Germany but hopefully you can use your good behavior and confession as a bargaining chip for leniency and perhaps dismissal with restitution.",

      "text": "As far as I'm concerned, if you're in a position to be stealing food, you can't be blamed for doing so. Once its down to survival, moral behavior gets complicated. On the other hand, if you were to consider entirely fair reparations, the cost of stolen goods is not enough. At the very least, one needs to account for interest. Also, there is the fact a business has profit margins that are unknown to you, since they noticed I'm betting not large. There may have been late payments with the associated fines, or arrangements with the suppliers that were lost. Also ofc the resulting emotional damage. If its a franchise, then sometimes those arrangements can be brutally unfair to the store owners. Not exactly nice to hear, but there is a world where the store's continued effort to seek \"justice\" (not that there is a legal system in this world that can provide that) was understandable beyond just abject callousness. \n\nI do respect the quest to set things right, and especially the trust in another to forgive. The most favorable outcome among two rational actors always requires trust, and a society of the smartest pragmatists will always be suffering. I hope you, and anyone reading this, are strong enough to not let this situation break your resolve for a trusting and empathetic world.",

Probation seems like the best fit here - there is a reasonable belief that you stole because you had to, you took inventory and paid it back, and considering your current situation, it doesn't seem reasonable for you to continue commiting crimes. Easy way to verify is simply tightening the noose for next year or two, if court is right, you'll have no issues doing it, and if they're wrong you'll be back. \n\nEssentially moral compass is present, seems to be calibrated correctly... No real point jailing someone who isn't actually dangerous to society and can be expected to be a good citizen, willing to right the wrongs. I mean, a thousand euros really isn't that big of a deal. \n\nI will note again, you need a lawyer. You are obviously guilty, and I wouldn't put it past the supermarket management to try and put all of the missing stuff, whoever stole it, on you - legally, they'd have a point stating you wanted to clean your name by forging the list, and that you stole much more.",
