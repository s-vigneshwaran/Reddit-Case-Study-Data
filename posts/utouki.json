Hell, when I\u2019m dead just throw me in the trash. Couldn\u2019t care less. But that\u2019s a whole \u2018nother thing.\n\nWhen i die, feel free to blast my remains from a cannon for all i care. The point is that obviously *they* disagree. and think the dead should be treated with more dignity than to just throw they in the trash.\n\n>It\u2019s misinformation because she\u2019s omitting information and her language deliberately exaggerates it and leads people to the conclusion that fetuses are aborted for the purpose of powering homes, even though what power they add is extremely negligible.\n\nI don't see any reasonable way anyone can say that is what she is saying. She is saying they are aborted, and what is done with the remains.\n\n> I\u2019m paraphrasing a little here, but she said \u201cfetuses are poisoned in the womb, dismembered and torn limb from limb, bodies thrown in waste bins and used to power a city\u2019s homes and street lights.\u201d She\u2019s using a basic propaganda technique, an \u201cappeal to fear,\u201d by painting an image with her words that isn\u2019t altogether accurate. It\u2019s true that some fetuses contribute to the power supply, but her words imply that it\u2019s done maliciously and in a barbaric way in order to incite outrage. That\u2019s misinformation.\r  \n\r\n\n She is not saying it is done maliciously, she is saying it is done callously.  \n\nShe is making an emotional factual statement. Late term abortions are poisoned in the womb, the spine is severed, then the fetus is mechanically dismembered and removed part by part.\n\nThe doctors throw them in the waste bin, and then they are used to generate power for the electrical grid.\n\nThe fact you think that factual description is an appeal to fear should really tell you all you need to know.",

I'll give you two different answers. \n\nReasons why women have abortions before 24 weeks; -Because I'm not ready to have one. -Because I'm too young. -Because I'm too old. -Because I already have children. -Because I would make a bad mother. -Because I don't want children. \n\nReasons why women have abortions after 24 weeks; \n\n-I was just diagnosed with cancer and the chemo would kill the fetus. \n\n-One of the twins died and its too late to be absorbed by my body so the dead fetus will kill my other baby and me.

The point is that if you do something to endanger your child's life with your own action, and you're the only one who can save her, and it is of only minimal or moderate risk to yourself, most people would morally expect you to protect your child's life, even at the expense of your own autonomy, and especially if the situation is your fault and no fault of the child.\n\nAnd it's no different with abortion, if you believe a fetus is equivalent to a child.\n\ni don't even have to make that analogy, anyway, because his argument is completely idiotic.  Of course parents are morally expected to sacrifice their bodily autonomy to protect their child.  We expect it all the time.  You *must* protect your child, or you will go down for child neglect.  You think that comes at no cost of bodily autonomy?  It requires us to take actions we otherwise wouldn't take.. to lose sleep we otherwise wouldn't lose.  Being a parent comes at the cost of your autonomy, in all forms of autonomy, and including bodily.  It happens all the time every day.  And if you believe a fetus is a child, then why would it be different?  The cost is greater?  Most pregnancies go well.\n\nEdit: This is probably best evidenced by the fact that even most pro-choicers expect you to carry the baby to term once it is viable.  Even most pro-choicers won't want you to abort at that point.  Why?  Because if it's your child, you are actually expected by most people to sacrifice bodily autonomy.  It's ridiculous the bodily autonomy argument even exists, but it does.",

De-institutionalization was started in the 60s, and was promoted by Kennedy because of the treatment of his sister Rosemary, who received a lobotomy that practically made her a vegetable. Mental hospitals were abysmal places, and there's all sorts of ethical issues involved with involuntary institutionalism. Go watch the documentary Titicut Follies to see what institutions were like in the late 60s, and read the works of psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, who was foundational in shifting both the public's and the American Psychiatric Association's perceptions about involuntary treatment in the 70s.\n\nWhat Reagan did was sign the bi-partisan Lanterman\u2013Petris\u2013Short Act as Governor of California in 67, which set the precedent for the rest of the US.\n\nThen, in 1980, Jimmy Carter passed something called the Mental Health Systems Act. That bill provided federal grants to local community mental hospitals, but a year later Reagan agreed with Democrats to sign a repeal that was put forward by the 96th Congress, who then had a Democratic majority in both houses. Their view was that it was better to allow the states, rather than the federal government, to control funding and operations of institutions.\n\nIt's been over 55 years since the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act was signed, and 42 since the Mental Health Systems Act was repealed. There has been more than enough time for other leadership to rehabilitate the mental health system, but so far there hasn't been any will to do so.",

Where are you getting the idea that somehow the government's going to force everyone to dispose of their own person in a particular way?",

I do not want to watch the rest of the video but your second point would definitely qualify. It is basically speech that is calling for hatred towards a specific group of people. It would be even easier if it includes blatant lies, like in your example, instead of half truths. Interestingly there is an exception, but not for 'public figures' like it often is in the US, but for politicians that currently occupy an elected seat. That doesn't mean that they can say whatever horrific shit they want but the law is a little looser for them. It is that way  for the respect towards the people who elected the politician and to encourage open debate and discourage unreasonable suing. That does complicate things some times and yet you could definitely not say something so dumb about your opponents.",

Also the people in power never get punished for committing crimes.\n\nThis sadly is a lesson many other countries need to learn as well as.  Canada has no safeguards in place either, we are just lucky our corruption has not yet reached the levels in the US , but if we don't hurry and put these safeguards in place is just a matter of time before we follow in the same path as the US.",

During the interview he basically states the GOP / conservatives have no reason to be truthful or honest in a post-liberal world because the fascism of the progressives is an affront to them.\n\nIt's crazy-talk that one side is called fascist because they are trying to impose a society where people have actual rights; a right to engage in premarital sex, a right to marry a person of a different race, a right to same-sex marriage, a right to vote, a right to read books, a right to speak out against an autocratic government (e.g. Florida). In their crazy world-view the imposition of those rights is precisely \"fascism.\"\n\nI spent some time reading state GOP platforms from 2012 and 2016 and they are pretty astounding in their honesty. Marriage is between one man and one woman, God is the core of all values, laws, and legislation, prayer in schools, a Bible-based educational system. I didn't realize conservatives were so against premarital sex and divorce. They would love to outlaw premarital sex and divorce, which is why we are hearing about banning contraceptives, both BC pills and condoms.\n\nThe term I use is Christofascism, which someone else coined. Others say, \"Talibangelicals.\" But the conservative movement has a precise analog to the Wahhabism of Islam, the very strict interpretation of the Qu'ran and tied to fundamentalism.",

They saw churches being shut down for a while during the pandemic as a direct attack from the liberals. They've essentially organized around the idea that \"liberals\" are attacking the American identity with \"wokeness\" and that the result is an emasculated and weak America that is experiencing precipitous decline. \n\nYou can see the same sort of thing happening when they were stripped of the right to enslave people. The evil liberal government is coming in and weakening America with their morals, human rights, and respect. Why do they hate gender identity issues? Because it's allowing men to be weak and replaced by trans men, etc, etc, etc. \n\nThis is and has always been the central theme for southern pieces of trash. The man's role is to protect / fight / be a warrior for christ. Anything that challenges that is weakening America and putting their sex slaves / wives at risk, and liberalism is the core of those challenges to traditional bullshit.",

Abd Aziz ibn Baz was essentially the driving influence that radicalized Juhayman al-Otabyi into belief that he was the Mahdi and subsequently led to the events in the Grand Mosque in Mecca in the 70's, if I understand things correctly.\n\nHow in the FUCK does an anti-monarchic mufti that helped spark what was/is possibly the single most controversial series of events in contemporary Islamic history, and led to the desecration of the peace of Mecca and sanctity of the presence of the Kaaba, later become Grand Mufti and help entrench Salafism in the kingdom?  I would have thought at the very least, a revocation of title if not accusations of apostasy would have been the result.\n\nWhat am I missing?",

What you\u2019re missing are just a few subtleties, so I\u2019ll try to give context for that.\n\nIbn Baz wasn\u2019t really anti-monarchic, nor for that matter was Juhayman initially. They were strict Salafists is all. Juhayman, as you said, became a Salafist fundamentalist at the influence of ibn Baz, but it was later that he realized the Kingdom wasn\u2019t following the strict tenets of Salafism and so must be toppled. This is something that ibn Baz never would have said. \n\nAfter the siege in Mecca, and the execution of Juhayman, the royals feared the growing discontent of fundamentalists in the country, and so in their infinite ~~lunacy~~ wisdom, they decided to appease them by giving them reign over state religion, education, etc, setting the country back a thousand years. \n\nIbn Baz\u2019s ideology was strictly \u201cSalafism=good\u201d. Juhayman\u2019s was \u201cSalafism=good, government\u2260Salafism, government=bad\u201d. So if government=Salafism, people like Juhayman wouldn\u2019t come to the conclusions he did, and try to revolt again. Giving a royal-friendly Salafist like ibn Baz prominence and power achieved that. And we all had to eat shit for the following 35 years. \n\nI hope that answers your question. Keep them coming if you have more. Also, I would recommend On Saudi Arabia by Karen Elliott House. She goes into a lot of this historical and cultural context, and it\u2019s a very well written book.",

I had a list of ones I read, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas ... Kentucky is just a link to the national GOP platform.\n\nI do feel more informed about the Republicans general game plan is, and that basically is to return the United States to about 1955-ish. That is my own assessment based on what I know about life in the United States in the 1950s. \n\nThe GOP somehow wants to ignore thousands of years of human history where gay people existed, where people had premarital sex. They want to ignore racism, sexism, bigotry. They delude themselves into thinking their Christian God is somehow a nice, benevolent being, when the entire Old Testament is God absolutely allowing babies, infants, women, pregnant women to be killed, exterminated in his name, under his authority, in fact.\n\nIt does make me feel like a bit of an alien, to be fair. That there is this delusional species of humans who live life in parallel with this other species of human, and one species just wants to be happy and live life, and the other wants that too but they want the other species to follow a set of rules which makes absolute zero sense, aren't reason or logic based, aren't sensible.",

The Ben Shapiro book about how to argue with liberals from the early 2010s says essentially the same thing. That liberals are so evil you dont need to worry about being honest or genuine with them. It essentially tells you to troll liberals. \n\nHell even before that, during the Gingrich years, the Republican party used to hold conferences for local small time political candidates on how to \"debate\" with political opponents and they also used to advocate just lying and manipulating.\n\nSpend a whole Saturday learning how to become the person Sartre is talking about in that quote everyone likes to post.\n\nThis post truth mindset has been a long time coming. Honestly, I'm pretty sure the only reason those conferences stopped was because they became redundant.",

I just dont get it. At some point the last decade \"alternative facts\" have become mainstream. I feel like when Obama became president 1/3 of the country became fucking nuts. That led to outlets like Fox news becoming crazier and crazier to match their base, then Trump happened, and then covid made people even more nuts. I left florida in 2010 and left behind many family and friends that i saw as good people. They were conservative and some christian,  but they were kind, meant well and had good intentions. Now.these same people have gone down the facebook rabbit hole and say the most terrible and hateful things. They genuinely believe things like \"antifa stormed the capitol\" and covid is fake etc. Its nuts to me, its like they joined a cult",

Populist demagogues are just a variation on the same theme.  Internet technology has been like the world's biggest ever birthday present to these folks.  They can now reach and \"influence\" millions at insanely low cost.  It's like televangelism without the broadcast fees.\n\nNotice that Far White BS online is free to access, whereas responsible journalism is mostly paywalled?  That's because BS is cheap to produce and is underwritten by deep-pockets sponsors like the Mercer and Koch families.  So it's much easier to get access to Q-adjacent baloney than real journalism or reporting.\n\nThis is one reason why a state-funded public broadcasting network is actually a useful thing, or can be so long as the state has sound ethics about fairness in reporting etc.\n\nWe are so close to the Waldo Moment, I am in a constant low-level state of existential terror.  The US really could revert to a tinpot dictatorship of oligarchs and theocrats (like Russia today).",

You and I might disagree on when that point is (I honestly have no idea when it begins), but I would err on the earlier side rather than the later side to be safe.",

My point a moment ago was that most fetuses would become people (which is still true at a clip of 4:1 even if 20% of pregnancies end in miscarriage).\n\nI'm sorry your medicine causes birth-defects. I imagine that is a heart-wrenching position to be in. You raise an interesting philosophical question about whether it's better to exist with suffering or to not exist entirely. While I don't have an answer to that question (as I've not thought much on the topic), my initial inclination is to think it's better to exist with suffering than not (based on the fact that we all suffer to some extent, and yet we also enjoy existing).

They found a way to get the cells to continue to reproduce so they don't need a supply of new fetuses.  Click bait articles and simple news pieces may just say \"fetal cells\" or imply that there's a continuous supply required. \n\nHere's one article I came across, but if you search for \"fetal cell lines\" and cosmetics (or even the specific brand you'reconcerned with), you'll get more detailed scientific explanations.  \n\nhttps://www.rehumanizeintl.org/post/fetal-cells-in-the-cosmetics-food-and-medical-industries\n\n\nBasically even if every abortion in the world was stopped and miscarriages didnt exist - these products and more would not be impacted in any way because they don't use new fetuses, they just generaye cells from the existing ones.  I believe the kones used by the cosmetic line getting all the attention are from a 14yo fetus donated by the mother who had to terminate for medical reasons in Switzerland.  Originally the skin care lotions they were developing were to help burn victims regenerate skin (ie there was a legitimate scientific purpose to start with) but apparently the products serve a cosmetic purpose too and are sold as cosmetics.  I thibk Oprah once promoted the brand, so she's tied to it. \n\nThere's another fetal cell line from IIRC the 70's that is used in development & testing in medical / pharmaceutical fields and works the same way (no new fetus supply required)  In those cases, they use the cells for testing and development (seeing which compounds react to cells injected with whatever they're curing) before moving onto animal testing.  It helps them narrow down what compounds or combination of compounds to might be useful, saving time & money.  Although they still do animal testing before movjng onto human testing, it's more acurate to start there bc they're human cells and it significantly cuts down on animal testing that would be done as trial & error if the fetal cells weren't used.  If they can't demonstrate changes or usefulness of something on the fetal cells in a petri dish - theres no need to waste money / time testing that on mice.  \n\nAlmost every modern medicine we have today is developed that way.  In those cases the final product doesn't actually contain the derived fetal cells (unlike the cosmetic products), they're just oart of the development & testing process. Even older medications from before this process was used may be tested using the cells today, to see if they help cure new diseases / illnesses.",

That's definitely not happening. \n\nIn reality, fetuses are considered medical waste. If you want to keep it and give it a proper burial or cremation you can, but if you don't it will go in with the medical/biohazard waste with the amputated limbs and gallbladders and tumors and what not. \n\nThis is either ground up and \"disposed of in a sanitary sewer\" (flushed like a goldfish) or incinerated. Some hospitals don't waste the energy generated by the incinerators and convert it to useable electricity. Sometimes it is shipped elsewhere and does become part of the municipal electrical grid. \n\nHere's an article about people realizing this in Oregon. They decided that limbs and tumors were ok, but no fetuses. https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fetal-tissue-used-generate-electricity-oregon-n88716    This was in 2014, I don't know if they got new ordinances passed. \n\nHere is another article about the process. \n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/45139-aborted-fetuses-burned-incinerated-medical-waste.html\n\n> The issue, however, isn't limited to one incinerator in Oregon: Aborted fetal tissue and other types of medical waste \u2014 amputated limbs, organs, cancerous tissue, bones and all manner of bodily fluids \u2014 are routinely burned for heat or electricity worldwide. [8 Grisly Archaeological Discoveries]\n> \n> In March, the British public was shocked to learn that the bodies of thousands of miscarried and aborted fetuses had been incinerated, along with other waste, to heat hospitals.\n> \n> \"This practice is totally unacceptable,\" said Dr. Dan Poulter, minister of the U.K. Department of Health, as quoted in The Telegraph. The incineration of fetal tissue was immediately banned at all National Health Service (NHS) hospitals.\n> \n> But in fact, the practice is totally acceptable by many government agencies worldwide (Poulter's indignation notwithstanding), and is even mandated in dozens of state health codes as a way of managing potentially hazardous and infectious medical waste.\n> \n> 'Grinding and discharging' fetal remains\n> \n> In Texas, the health code allows for the disposal of human tissue or fetuses by seven legal means, including incineration, \"disinfection followed by deposition in a sanitary landfill\" and \"grinding and discharging to a sanitary sewer.\"\n> \n> In North Carolina, health care facilities \"shall dispose of fetal remains by burial, cremation or incineration,\" per state regulations.\n> \n> South Dakota stipulates that \"any hospital, clinic or medical facility in which abortions are induced or occur spontaneously or accidentally \u2026 shall arrange for the disposal of the remains by cremation, interment by burial or by incineration in a medical waste incinerator approved by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources.\"\n> \n> And because many states and cities now use waste as an eco-friendly source of energy, medical waste (including body parts and fetal remains) is combined with household garbage and other types of waste to create heat or electricity.\n> \n> 'Gross' waste\n> \n> The fetal remains incinerated in Oregon had come, in part, from Canada, and were hauled into Oregon by the waste management firm Stericycle, AP reports.\n> \n> Marion County Commissioner Sam Brentano said the county would soon rewrite its ordinance to exclude all fetal tissue from its incinerator, while other medical waste will still be accepted, according to the AP.\n> \n> \"So if someone loses an arm, loses a finger?\" Carlson asked at a recent meeting of Marion County commissioners, according to the AP.\n> \n> \"That should go in and be burned,\" Brentano answered. \"As gross as that is.\"",

People seem to think that there are medical waste treatment plants out there burning waste as fuel and generating electricity from the burned waste. This is not the case. There are waste treatment plants out there burning waste *by combusting fuels like natural gas* and then using the left-over heat to power turbines to generate electricity. These processes can have *up to* 84% energy recovery efficiency, but they still aren't generating power (it's in section 4). \n\nThere is [one proposal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/463/1/012180) for building a pyrolyzer-rankine power plant in the Philippines, which the study claims could have up to 400% efficiency, actually producing power. However, I can't find anything that indicates that any medical waste pyrolyzer-rankine power plants currently actually *exist*.",

I was trying to back into my driveway and I temporarily forgot how to do it because I was laughing too much.\n\nWittels stupid genius is much missed.\n\nEdit:\n/u/BlackQuilt pointed out they are on Spotify! If you search CBB (Comedy Bang Bang) and then order the episodes from oldest to newest they are pretty easy to find. Just look for the 4 with Chelsea Peretti, Adam Scott, and Harris Wittels.",

Not to worry though, even in the absence of good people there are plenty of the bad ones to go around. \n\nI don\u2019t know why anyone good goes into politics. Imagine living under a microscope, getting nit picked and second guessed constantly by people that refuse to even follow the news, treated as corrupt and evil, and getting death threats because you tried to be a public servant.

I had to go get approval from the local government to allow the bikes to be parked along public streets.  There was this 60 year old dude who was obsessed with the idea that packs of wild dogs were gonna be a big issue, and the city planners weren't doing enough to address this issue.  He was crazy as hell but he was polite and followed the rules so they had to just let him waste time...like every session, lol.  So I knew in 1999 that parks and rec was a documentary, hah.  \n\nAs a side quest, I was working in an altzheimers wing of a nursing home at the time, and so I tried get to know him better and see if he was having some mental health or dementia issues, turns out his wife had died young, and he had a cat as a companion animal, that was super clutch for his happiness, but they kept getting eaten.  But he lived in town, so he assumed it had to be feral dogs, not coyotes, despite our area being thick with coyotes.  My buddy did problem animal removal, so I had him come check it out, and my buddy told him how house cats are like crack to coyotes, they can't help themselves.  If he had a super smart coyote, who understood traps, but was killing some farmers lambs or something, he had this old Tom cat who he'd use as bait (in a special cage trap he welded up where the coyote could get it) and he had a 100% success rate, even with coyotes that had avoided all traps, hah.  So basically he told parks and rec guy, you should just have your cat be an indoor cat.  And he stopped coming to the city planning meetings, hah.",

A more complete version of the video shows Nucatola explicitly saying the tissues are not for sale\u2014the prices she refers to correspond to fully legal reimbursements. Per the 1984 law, \"reasonable payments\" associated with transportation, organ removal, and storage, among other factors, are legal. In a statement, Planned Parenthood's vice president of communications, Eric Ferrero, said his organization helps patients donate tissue \"just like every other high-quality health care provider does. \"\u00a6 There is no financial benefit for tissue donation for either the patient or for Planned Parenthood.",

Labor is one of the most painful human experiences, not to mention the pain pregnancy can cause leading up to and after the birth and/or suffering complications which may be lifelong. Instead it is deciding that the unborn child's hurt being minimized is more important than the mother's (and potentially anyone else who is affected.)\n\nTo bring anyone in the world is to subject them to suffering, no one lives a life where they don't get hurt at some point. Many people wish they were never born, and some people truly have bad lives. Not to mention the potential anyone has to live a life making others suffer. \n\nTruly if we wanted to minimize the amount of people who get hurt, the best thing to do would be to never let anyone be born and have the humans alive today be the last. If it is wrong to hurt people but it's ok to hurt some people in order to minimize hurt (like making someone pregnant give birth in order to minimize the hurt to the unborn child), then that's the next logical step. The unborn of the current generations will endure hurt, but the potential hurt prevented of hundreds and thousands of generations of humans will surely outweigh it.",

Your typical fetus is probably around a half ounce, 14g. Given a 20% conversion efficiency, you'd net about .02kwh per fetus.\n\nWashington DC uses 11.3 TWh of electricity per year. So to keep everything running we'd need 565 billion fetuses per year.  Assuming you need 3 months to make one, this would require around 70 times the world's population of women of child bearing age working non-stop to keep your supply up.\n\nOf course this assumes 100% fertility and also ignores the gigantic overhead of sustaining that population (you can't just burn all the fetuses or you'll run out of people to make them). \n\nIn conclusion, a fetus-based energy supply is likely unfeasible.\n\nEdit: it occured to me after that we can gain two orders of magnitude in biomass at the cost of just a factor of three gestation time. Closer but not quite viable.",

The evangelical church doesn't appear to have been a political factor in any major way pre-nixon. Billy Graham regretted his involvement (if you believe him), but was pivotal in showing nixon and conservatives how to court the conservative Christians. \n\n Jerry Falwell then turned it up to 11, by turning the \"separatist\" Baptist groups into the \"Moral Majority\" solidifying an inherent divide between the GoP and Democrat Christians.  This occurring while evangelical Jimmy Carter was running for president,  but wasn't on board with the key issues that now make up the evangelical political core: abortion,  homosexuality, and prayer in schools/ so called \"religious freedom\".\n\nFalwell then was able to use Carter's own honesty in his Christian beliefs about how people aren't perfect,  but should be forgiven. Carter gave personal examples of his own moral failings at times, which were used to say he wasn't Christian enough.  Carter did some of this on an interview published in playboy,  which dropped his approval rating by 15% over 2 weeks. This was a HUGE contributing factor in Carter losing his reelection to Reagan,  and Reagan specifically courting the new Falwell movement,  even saying with Reagan they got \"a real Christian on the white house\".",

A major factor in what makes an oligarch is that the established government GIVES people industries to control, giving a wholly incestuous and corrupt relationship between the government and the economy. Rich people and economic leaders having greater influence does not equal an oligarch. Nor is it even necessarily a bad thing. My favorite part of that study you linked was how it said \"the average person still gets what they want the majority of the time.\" Sounds like its working as intended eh?\n\nAnyways, good luck. Also please don't be an absolute cliche, do you know how often engineers overestimate their abilities in anything not engineering? Very often. Idk what it is about engineers but holy shit learn some self awareness of your limitations, cuz everyone else can see them except you.

Preliminary results should never be published, even if they are exciting. \n\nThe government should regulate, but not participate in this process. They have no say in what the peer review process indicates. \n\nAlso, \"news\" should no longer be able to be classified as entertainment. The news should report truths, not opinions. Because people these days have access to so much information, but aren't given a way (in our schools at least) to disseminate the facts and the truths from the bullshit. Critical thinking isn't encouraged.\n\nThe peer review system I mentioned already largely exists, but anyone can just skirt it and send their info directly to the \"news\" who interprets it as they want and then says a scientist said it.

They realize then that Russia was going through the motions, they (Russia) had already decided what they were going to do, so the journalist rented an apartment outside the country so they have a place to go. Lo and behold, Russia invaded.\n\nThis feels the same - and likely right out of their benefactors' handbook. In fact, if you look at all their actions and reframe it as 'this is what Putin/Kremlin would do' it starts to make sense. The GOP knows this shit is absolutely stupid and outrageous - they're going through the motions, they don't care. They have the outcome they want locked down and are just BSing for appearances. They are gonna do it again and again with every civil right they want repealed.\n\nSo, like that journalist, I'm starting to lay out the foundation for my quick exit out of Texas. I *highly* suggest the rest of y'all do the same. Save as much money as you can, reach out to friends and family in blue states if you can, figure out where you gonna go. Get your IUDs and stock up on contraceptives now. If you can trust yourself with a gun, get one and learn how to use it.

No rational person would ever believe that, but that is actually the point: evangelical Christians are, quite literally, irrational thinkers.

Even Catholic doctrine now accepts evolution as truth, but the lunatic evangelicals who represent a large portion of the American electorate think we lived side-by-side with dinosaurs and the world was created in exactly 6 24-hour days. They also believe that god felt tired after all that creation and rested his lazy ass for a full day. I mean, why the hell does an omnipotent being need to take a day off to rest? Sounds sus to me. \n\nAnyhow, this is the intended audience for that horrible, false, reckless, ignorant, and dangerous myth that evil shill released into the world. The swamp uses murdered babies to sustain its power. This woman did more than yell fire in a crowded theater - she lit a fire in a crowded theater.

Ai\u00faa originate from the Outside, a place beyond the universe with no physical laws, things only exist via will and thought.

And on top of not requiring a whole virtual reality to keep them docile, silicone-based processors don't need oxygenated air to breathe, or calories and amino and fatty acids, they don't excrete waste, etc. etc.\n\nI know it's a movie, so obviously there's got to be some suspension of disbelief, but the CPU thing only makes marginally more sense to me than the battery explanation.",

That sounds more like she is trying to highlight the disgusting way that people treat these poor babies with no care as if they don't matter (assuming her perspective, not that it's mine)\n\nHonestly my thought is from the perspective of someone that thinks human life starts at conception, it kind of makes sense for them to make an emotional argument (appeal more so) like this? Like if there was a case where a baby died in childbirth and no one wanted to bury it or cared about it so they threw it into the incinerator I'd imagine people feeling upset about that. And for the staunch prolifers they do equate fetuses and babies\n\nIt is a bit unfortunate because it would be fractions of a percent of all waste being burned for energy, though I guess for some people any amount isn't okay? But yeah should you then have a burial for all aborted fetuses? That seems real excessive. Maybe they'd want them cremated instead, but I feel like why not just throw em with the rest of the stuff that is going to be burned for energy",

I took a quick look at this paper, [Medical Waste Treatment Technologies for Energy, Fuels, and Materials Production: A Review](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/energies/energies-14-08065/article_deploy/energies-14-08065.pdf?version=1638437223) from October 2021. People seem to think that there are medical waste treatment plants out there burning waste as fuel and generating electricity from the burned waste. This is not the case. There are waste treatment plants out there burning waste *by combusting fuels like natural gas* and then using the left-over heat to power turbines to generate electricity. These processes can have *up to* 84% energy recovery efficiency, but they still aren't generating power (it's in section 4). \n\nThere is [one proposal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/463/1/012180) for building a pyrolyzer-rankine power plant in the Philippines, which the study claims could have up to 400% efficiency, actually producing power. However, I can't find anything that indicates that any medical waste pyrolyzer-rankine power plants currently actually *exist*.",

No. Electric cars brake to stop or slow down - at the same time they recover energy as a byproduct. Same with incinerators. No energy is made while burning those tissues.

It makes it worse. People like this have their whole support structure pulled away, anyone knew is scared of their insane perspectives so they find solice in people who view the world the same way and go even further down the rabbit hole.\n\nEdit: to clarify this woman has no responsibility to do this. She has every right to live her life with someone who values her.

Even the most well-meaning liberal men have implicit biases that will take a lifetime to unlearn. And then there's just the inherent ignorance of what a woman's lived experience is. However, there are levels to that sexism/ignorance, and unfortunately if a woman doesn't overhear her beloved having guy talk with his friends when one of those subjects comes up, or they completely avoid political talk because they're too busy holding hands and picking out curtains, she may not find out til well into the marriage.",

Haven't you ever heard the Avenue Q song, \"Everyone's a little bit racist sometimes.\"\n\nIt's very human to be \"a little\" racist, sexist, lots of -ists. If you have a lot of similar interactions with a homogenous group, your brain, which is designed to detect patterns, will start to expect that behavior or experience with those groups. If you're a man and most of the women you interact with in your life know very little about sports, you're going to have the implicit bias that women don't know that much about sports. So, when talking to a new woman you've just met and the topic of sports comes up, you might speak to her on a very basic level about sports. Then when she pipes up with some comments that show she knows a lot about sports, you might be surprised. That's sexism - you assumed something about her knowledge of a topic based solely on her sex. Does that make you a terrible person? No. It makes you human. But it's important to be able to recognize that because if  you don't, it can turn into more serious interactions, like if you work in the sporting industry and a woman applies for a job and you overlook her application because you assume she'll have less experience/knowledge in the field than a man.\n\nThe problem with people getting butthurt like you did and responding with the sentiment that you did is that you refuse to acknowledge your own implicit biases and therefore can't work to make sure they don't inadvertently turn into something more serious, which can happen very naturally to ANYONE.\n\nI'd argue that it takes conscientious effort to prevent yourself from developing and acting on the racism, sexism, colorism, etc. that is present in EVERYONE.",

                      "text": "I\u2019d classify Scientology as a cult and a tax evasion scheme, not a religion, but that line is real blurry.\n\nThe reason I asked the question is that religions exist that meet all the standard definitions of a religion. They\u2019re a system of deeply held beliefs and philosophies shared by a community, but the belief in deities is either absent or optional. Confucianism is another example. Hindus can be theist or atheist. \n\nEven Quakers and Unitarians, which are offshoots of Christianity, have a tradition of welcoming  atheist members, and the intent was not to convert them. There\u2019s also a long tradition of Jewish secularism, which loosely maps to our modern concept of agnosticism.\n\n I was also once the militant atheist that would say something like this, that I could never date anyone who\u2019s religious, but it came from a place of ignorance of all the sorts of belief systems that religion can encompass. It was actually an absolute rejection of theism and organized religion, as you\u2019d find in Catholicism, mainline Protestantism, and Islam. The line between religion and philosophy and spirituality gets very blurry when you leave the confines of what we typically think of as a religion in the West, ie. Abrahamic religions. I\u2019m not sure how much the distinction matters in the end, as they\u2019re usually synonymous. I still wouldn\u2019t date a practicing theist. But I feel like it comes across a lot less harsh when you frame it as, I could never be married to someone who believed in God, than someone who believes in a religion.",

I also appreciate that you're open to some grey area here in your response.\n\nRegarding being critical of OP's categorical position here, it does seem like an unusual position to take.  There are a great many that expore religion that aren't radicalized, narrow-minded, or hypocritical.  Some of the most caring, supportive, and loving people I've had the fortune of knowing where religious, and their ethics / behavior were largely influenced by their religious views.  While not religious personally I think it strange to create a binary condition around it without further qualification.\n\nSo I don't think OP's concern that exploring any specific religious system will result in something terrible is automatically granted.  That's not to diminish his feelings about it, who knows he could have had some personal traumatic experience with it earlier in life and has as a result a charged reaction to the subject matter in general?

Simply the exposure to what her media says about what pro life people believe and do led her to take up with the idea that my sister would abort a child she wanted to have based off sex.  They really do get told and believe that pro life people handle abortion like choosing whether you want starbursts or a bag of chips at the convenience store, instead of a fraught decision freighted with deep implications and existential meaning for most people having to go through with the decision.",

Say you change the mind of 1 in 20 republican voters and get them to vote dem, that is a 10% shift (voters switching basically count double), many votes are won by margins less than that, if it was evenly distributed that would be apocalyptic for the republican party. And that would probably go along with  a big shift in public opinion, public opinion isn't winner take all but if something has a 50/50 split and you convert 5% from one side a 55/45 split is already a noticeable imbalance. \n\nI am not saying that 5% of a big group isn't something really really hard to achieve, just that 1 in 20 is far from the impossible everyone benchmark. So it doesn't make sense to look at everyone because that is just discouraging.\n\n(Also you don't necessarily have to change anyone's political orientation to change elections. USA has really low midterm turnouts, 50% is high there. It is probably  higher in narrow elections, but take [Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_United_States_Senate_election_in_Texas). For their Senate seat Ted Cruz was 2.6% ahead while the turnout was \"53.01% (of registered voters)\n42.07% (of voting age population)\", in comparison [66.7%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election_in_Texas) voted there in the 2020 presidential election. If you somehow convinced everyone who votes in presidential elections for dems to  vote in mid terms too without convincing the same amount of reps, there would have been a landslide victory without touching reps or people that never vote. Unlikely for sure but just saying that in theory the whole balance in US elections could be changed without convincing a single republican.)",

Most of the bills they put through to address problems have loads of stuff tagged on that even normal conservatives couldn\u2019t agree with. Basically policies put forward that Dems know Republicans can\u2019t pass, but don\u2019t care because they think the headlines of Republicans voting against this or that is enough of a political win.\n\nIt\u2019s an absolute disgrace and unfortunately my own country (the UK) isn\u2019t all that much better when Tories are in power.",

They make sure we get terribly flawed choices to chose from and make sure their opponents are just as corrupt as they are. Until people can tear themselves away from the party they support and start looking for people who are running for the right reasons we are screwed. The current political landscape in America isnt much different than the propaganda machine used to fool the german people back in the late 1930\u2019s.

Im afraid the next step for the religious right here is violence. There were a couple of times I worried my own family would decide I was an enemy and kill me. \n\nIm trying to maintain enough energy to plan my exit if need be and Im no longer suger coating this to people. Shits getting bad and real at a fast pace. \n\nFor those being like \"What a drama queen, it aint that bad\", i invite you to check out r/qanoncasualties.\n\nI'll say it openly, too: If you made it from the US somewhere else, I'd love to talk to you.

Certain types of medical waste are burned in natural gas or coal power plants as it\u2019s a very efficient method of getting rid of it. But it\u2019s no where near the degree that she makes it sound. A fairly standard coal powered plant will use nearly 10000 tons of coal per day, if we use 70 tons per day of medical waste as a baseline ([per an article about a Rhode Island waste operation](https://www.clf.org/blog/burning-medical-waste-dangers/) ) then all medical waste would make up .7% of incinerated material providing power, however medical waste is not 100% fetus remains. Of the 70 tons we\u2019re assuming is burned only 2.9 tons would contain any kind of human tissue ([pathological waste is the relevant portion here](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Percentage-of-the-composition-of-medical-wastes_fig1_276493604) ) and that is obviously not completely fetal remains either. I can\u2019t find any information on what percentage of pathological waste could be fetal remains but it\u2019s certainly not all of it. \n\nAt most 290 Kilowatts of electricity could be produced per day from all human remains and the DC area has 322,793 homes, when you include business and industrial use the total amount of power per location is a fraction of 1 Watt. Aborted fetuses account for enough power to light the clock on everyone\u2019s microwave for a minute each day. It\u2019s not exactly a Soilent Green type situation happening.",

People seem to think that there are medical waste treatment plants out there burning waste as fuel and generating electricity from the burned waste. This is not the case. There are waste treatment plants out there burning waste *by combusting fuels like natural gas* and then using the left-over heat to power turbines to generate electricity. These processes can have *up to* 84% energy recovery efficiency, but they still aren't generating power (it's in section 4). \n\nThere is [one proposal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/463/1/012180) for building a pyrolyzer-rankine power plant in the Philippines, which the study claims could have up to 400% efficiency, actually producing power. However, I can't find anything that indicates that any medical waste pyrolyzer-rankine power plants currently actually *exist*.",

There\u2019s just not enough waste created in any metro area to use full for a full scale operation, the energy density is so much less than coal or natural gas that it would take many times the amount of fuel burned to keep a plant going. I would imagine the US as a whole doesn\u2019t even generate enough medical waste to keep a large scale operation fueled, although I cant find any specific figures to the annual amount made due to some EPA deregulations back in the 90s.",

She's actually not entirely incorrect, except for one little point, which makes her entirely incorrect.\n\nDC actually *does* get a relatively significant amount of energy from burning biomass ([about 17%](https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=DC), to be specific). So I think that's what she's going off of, but [biomass energy only includes readily burnable things like wood, paper, municipal and agricultural waste, and sewage](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/). This doesn't include medical waste, which is either incinerated or autoclaved, but I'm guessing she buys into the idea that aborted fetuses are simply tossed in the trash (and so could make their way into the incinerators used to supply power to DC).\n\nThere have been a few studies on using medical waste to produce energy (like [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4051272/)), but nothing has actually happened yet (at least in DC) as far as I can tell.",

We aren\u2019t killing babies and using them for power. she\u2019s implying we specifically use them for power, which is false. or that we only burn fetus which is also false. In fact she never actually explained the context in which the incineration is happening at all or even explained where she got the info. it\u2019s purposely taken out of context to mislead people into having an emotional response to the issue when it is in fact a non issue. \nWe do the same thing for blood and placenta. What do you think they do to severed arms and legs? \n\nI feel like the argument in itself is specious when considering context that removing waste is necessary and that finding a way to reclaim energy is necessary. and that medical waste is an extremely broad category and not just for abortions.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you are getting downvoted. you are right it\u2019s not a lie outright.

You can ask them why they vote/rally for R's when they are being actively subjugated by them, and they will say, \"I can't vote for a Demon-crat!\"\n\nKick religion out of politics and alot of this would eventually clear up...\n\nEdit: TBC, I don't believe in evil.

Many very high in the party, and the GOP actively embraces them and many of their policies. So if conservatives can look in their own party and say, hmm, 'Alot of racists and homophobes in here', and then say, 'yeah, I'm ok with that...' then that's not a deal-breaker for the average conservative, and it's a plus for some conservatives. While they may not BE racists/homophobes, they are OK with them. The only way to keep reasonable people voting with the GOP is to say the other side is \"Evil\" and out for the destruction of the United States. \n\nMost of my friends are conservatives, a function of where I live unfortunately. They aren't raving lunatics or bad people. They wouldn't be my friends if they were. On the scant times we do have political discussions, I ask them if they think Health Care sucks? Yes. Do you believe the climate is changing, no matter the cause? Yes. Do you believe people, even gay people should be able to do whatever they damn well please? Yes. Then how the hell can you vote Republican? Because Democrats are Evil and out to destroy the nation with Socialism... Almost every one of them is using or plans to use Social Security during retirement, which BTW, is fucking SOCIALIST... it would be funny if it wasn't so tragic. \n\nProgressives gate keeping the middle out is not productive. \n\nI've turned people around on Climate Change. I've turned people around on health care. I don't know anyone that dislike the rights of gay people. Even after that, they refuse to vote for anyone without an R next to their name. They are usually one issue voters and that comes down to 2 issues that trump all others, abortion and guns. Those are the boogey men that keep reasonable R voters up at night. Those issues allow R's to paint D's as Evil, and allows those otherwise reasonable people to be led into Fascism, which is a different story...",

Can't talk about the US, but in Germany we still use the heat produced from incinerating medical waste to produce electricity. This includes human tissues like amputated limbs, tumors, and organs. How aborted embryos are disposed of depends on state and the weight of the embryo. An embryo with a weight of 0.5-1 kg or more is \"bestattungspflichtig\", i.e. they have to receive a more or less proper funeral. As far as I understand, embryos below this weight will be incinerated with other medical waste and, yes, electricity will be generated from the heat.\n\nNow obviously, that is not the picture this woman you to visualize and before anyone accuses me of anything, I fully support women's and everyone's authority over their own body and that obviously includes the right to abortion.

If any fetal remains end up in an incinerator (which based on your reply they most certainly do) then she is absolutely correct. \n\nNow the takeaway from that is different depending on your belief system. If you\u2019re like her and you believe that even a 4 week old fetus is a human life, then even one being burned with trash is horrific. \n\nThen again, she does talk about fetuses being torn limb from limb being burned which based on your comment may not be happening. \n\nAt the very least when I heard her comment I thought huh I can see this happening. I\u2019d like to know more.  I didn\u2019t jump to let\u2019s ban abortion.\n\nNot everything is black and white. This is probably an area of gray the shade of which should depend on the facts, not one\u2019s political leanings.",

They would be part of the trash that\u2019s burned for electricity. Waste-to-energy plants burn municipal solid waste (MSW) to produce steam in a boiler that is used to generate electricity. MSW is a mixture of energy-rich materials such as paper, plastics, yard waste, and products made from wood. Edit: and maybe fetal remains? Though disposal methods shouldn\u2019t have a damned thing to do with a woman\u2019s right to choose.",

I do not know if this is actually true, as medical waste seems to usually be disposed of separately from regular waste, but I think I see the picture she's trying to paint.\n\nIt's still real stupid, but I don't think she's trying to say that there's literally power plants powered exclusively by fetuses in DC.",

I know some power plants are specially designed to burn biowaste material alongside gas or coal to help dispose of certain types of waste; the type of waste you normally don't recycle and is going to be incinerated anyway so they put the produced heat to good use (some countries also do similar with local crematoriums).\n\nIf I had to guess there's at least one power plant that burns biowaste as part of its design, and that waste almost always is where biohazard materials end up; anything disposed of from a hospital as biohazard is normally incinerated for obvious reasons.\n\nNow, given most women aren't interested in keeping the small bundle of cells that form an early abortion (although my wife used to do funerals for a maternity ward so you'd be amazed at some of the \"babies\" I've heard her have to cater for that were kept by the parents), the biowaste from those abortions would be disposed of via incineration.\n\nSo in a very tenuous and roundabout way, if DC does have a plant that burns biowaste and uses the heat for turbines, and that waste includes hospital waste, they aren't lying. They're just not painting the full picture.",

If we're cool with using electricity generated from burning discarded kidneys for example, then this is no different.

It almost feels like, if we don't allow fetuses as medical waste, then what can we allow? I mean, technically speaking nearly everything that's medical waste was alive at one point, so why would there be a difference?  \n\n\n\\> I disagree with the point of this lady's testimony but factually she's probably right.\n\nYeah, she's probably right in that they've been used, but I guess it ends up being a bit like the whole \"aborted fetuses in vaccines thing\", like it's \\*technically\\* true I guess, but misses the whole fact that they are only derived from the fetal tissue and have no real connection to it, anymore.

How many people do you know are that size? It doesn't have cognition or sentience. It hasn't finished developing. It can't survive outside the womb because it's still akin to a seed, not a sprouted tree.\n\n>poisoned in the womb, and dismembered, torn limb from limb\n\nAbout 50% of abortions involve the use of medications that basically cause a miscarriage. This involves blocking hormones necessary for pregnancy and having the fetus detach from the uterine wall and then it gets flushed from the system like any other natural miscarriage. There's no poison. There's no dismemberment.\n\nBut also, since 90% of abortions occur by 12 weeks, the fetuses are tiny and have barely developed limbs. There's not much to \"tear limb from limb\" even if you wanted to. \n\nPro-birthers love to conflate scenarios to make abortion seem as horrific as possible. They'll pretend abortions are regularly performed on babies five seconds before delivery and when the fetus is fully formed and developmentally no different than a born baby. The pictures they show you on their posters are often stillborn babies at or close to full development. They don't show you the result of 12 week medical abortions because it would weaken their position. They ignore that most \"late term abortions\" are medically necessary to save the life of the woman and/or when the fetus is no longer viable, which is a completely different scenario from a woman who doesn't want to be pregnant choosing to have an abortion. They focus on edge cases as if they're the majority. But in their fanaticism to ban the 12 week abortion, they're going to get the woman who needs the 24 week medically necessary abortion killed because they'll either outlaw the procedure or [scare doctors into not performing it and/or other related medical care](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2022/05/roe-dobbs-abortion-ban-reproductive-medicine-alabama.html).",

On another part of their website they detail the process of [turning non-hazardous waste into energy](https://www.stericycle.com/en-us/resource-center/blog/the-method-benefits-of-turning-waste-into-energy). They give a breakdown on different [types of medical waste](https://www.stericycle.com/en-us/solutions/regulated-waste-disposal/biohazardous-medical-waste), where body parts and tissues are pathological waste which isn't inherently hazardous waste. Contact with certain drugs or being potential infectious would elevate it to hazardous.\n\nI was assuming fetuses would be under this umbrella of pathological waste but that actually doesn't seem to be the case. I can't find a standard term used to classify fetuses that has its own specific disposal requirements, and some states do has specific legislation for fetal tissue disposal. While that gets rid of the extremely strong link I had originally thought it doesn't negate the possibility as in my mind it'd be easiest to dispose of fetuses in the same way unless there was specific legislation that said otherwise. But that's just assumptions on my part. You could always call the company above and ask them\n\nHere's an [article from 2014](https://www.livescience.com/45139-aborted-fetuses-burned-incinerated-medical-waste.html) where there was outrage in Oregon for fetuses being used in electricity generation that discusses other states where that might be the case as well\n\nSo it seems pretty clear that it happens. The discussion should probably be more around it not being that big a deal than \"how can anyone be this stupid\" \"someone that says this should be institutionalized\" that is all over this thread",

For some people it is (or at least they make it sound like it is) a big deal to them.\n\nBut yeah the question of alternatives is a hard one too. Obviously you aren't gonna bury all of the fetuses. I guess you could just cremate them? But that's pretty much a half-step away from producing energy so why not just do that?\n\nPart of me thinks maybe it isn't a bad idea to make a point to not burn fetuses to produce energy just because there are people that care and maybe it will make some people on the fence more comfortable because there is \"dignity\" involved or some shit especially since it's such a minor fraction of fuel.

He cut back CDC personnel in China.\n\nTrump appointed four different CDC directors in three years.\n\nTrump appointed five different FDA commissioners in three years.\n\nThe CDC and FDA were so slow and uncoordinated in their response, and extremely slow to roll out testing, due to lack of solid leadership and the lack of the resources in the NSC that would have been responsible for getting them coordinated and ahead of this.\n\nAside from the travel restrictions, which were rendered much less effective than they could have been due to lack of testing of the people coming in, our massive delay in testing destroyed any chances of a softer landing from this pandemic.\n\nThere was a lack of stockpiled supplies because the Republican House refused to fund replenishment. Trump wrongly blamed Obama for this, but in his years as president, he never once attempted to replenish the supplies.\n\nhttps://www.propublica.org/article/us-emergency-medical-stockpile-funding-unprepared-coronavirus\n\nhttps://wayback.archive-it.org/3920/20140402145424/http://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy2012/fy2012bib.pdf\n\nTrump also cancelled the program that could have created them very quickly when they were needed.\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/federal-government-spent-millions-to-ramp-up-mask-readiness-but-that-isnt-helping-now/2020/04/03/d62dda5c-74fa-11ea-a9bd-9f8b593300d0_story.html\n\nhttps://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/news/Pages/n95.aspx\nThe Trump administration ignored the pandemic response playbook that the Obama administration created and briefed them on during the transition, even running a response exercise with his team.\n\nTrump told the states they should procure the supplies for themselves, and then proceeded to override their attempts to do so by seizing the supplies for the federal government.\nTrump seemed to be determined to remove everything done by Obama (and even Bush), regardless of how little sense that makes, or how many people will be harmed or even die due to his decisions.\n\nAnd that's not even all of it. That's just within the first few months or so. There were many other screw-ups with the personnel he put in charge and how they ran the programs that were supposed to be helping people and the states.",

So she actually has more voting power then most of the country at least when it comes to presidential votes. \n\nAlso, things get real dangerous when people argue against democracy by saying \"those people\" are to dumb to vote. Historically, it's never worked out well.",

Women were denied the right to vote for centuries because men said they were too dumb or too emotional. Today we are more informed and enlighten, so we understand that a person\u2019s sex has no bearing on their worth. But in the same vein, people in the future will discover moral truths that we are currently blind to.\n\nThis woman is a bad example, and I really wish people like her would voluntarily choose to stop voting. Or better yet, just develop some fucking critical thinking skills. But the right for all people to vote is a hill I'll die on any day.",

Aborted fetuses are presumably medical waste unless they\u2019re big enough for burial, which I know some places do. But I don\u2019t see anything wrong with the less developed fetuses/clumps of cells simply being treated as medical waste. It\u2019s not like we save and bury very early miscarriages.",

Here's a more in-depth look at the autoclave process we use:\n\n> Collect waste. Our waste transportation specialists pick up your waste, bring it to our facilities and then we prepare it for autoclaving.\nWeigh and track waste. Before processing, we document the waste to ensure proper procedure and tracking. \nBegin the Autoclave process. Waste is heated to 285\u00b0F at a pressure of 30 psi\u2014effectively eliminating all pathogens.\nTransport waste to waste-to-energy incinerator. Upon completion of the autoclave waste sterilization, the waste is taken to a waste-to-energy incinerator for final processing.\n\n> Our final disposal site for regulated medical waste is a waste-to-energy incinerator. At this point the process, waste is safe and sterile. The waste-to-energy incineration process offers an efficient way to ensure your waste is disposed of in a sustainable way.\n\n> *By processing waste in this manner, our incinerator partner is able to provide a massive amount of sustainable electricity to up to 40,000 homes.*\n\nEdit: I will say I *don\u2019t* believe this is used for fuel in DC - I think they specifically have regulations against it so her argument is extra stupid because it\u2019s not even using an accurate location.",

The other commenter shared a link stating that the places they talking about used biohazard/medical waste as a fuel source. \n\nHow is this not proof enough?

As far as I'm concerned, as long as the (non)parents don't object, you should be able to burn them, eat them, fuck them, whatever, who cares. They're dead. \n\nI mean honestly, pro-choice people, myself among them, don't think fetuses are worthy of full moral consideration even when they're alive. They're not people yet. Why would we care what happens after they're dead?",

Thats called Pro Choice. \n\nIf you aren't against it, you're for it. You can't say it's my neighbors choice to keep a slave and say you're against slavery. That isn't being pro-choice that's pro-slavery. This is the same. \n\n\n>Nobody would call you a pro lifer, you dont give a shit about babies who are born and suffering. You right wingers dont give a shit about any lives other than your own. \n\nWell, besides you not knowing me personally I'll excuse that you don't know how much I try and do for those in need in my community. But let's say I genuinely didn't give a shit about them.\n\n The question at hand is what is a human life because human life deserves to be protected and given the right to life. Even if I thought that life was on its own once its in this world, that wouldn't make killing that life in the womb moral or less of a violation of that human's right to life. \n\n\n>Right, you Republicans hate freedom and want to control women. Nobody is confused here.\n\nI think its nuts what women have to do in this country to get a mastectomy. They should absolutely have more body autonomy over their body. They just don't have the right to kill a separate human life inside of them.\n\nEdit: since you blocked me I'll just leave this here. \n\n\n>Nope. You said \"I took away one very specific choice for abortions\".\n\nYeah which is the same as saying I took away abortions lol.\n\n\n>Sorry George Bush, thats not how it works ;)\n\nReally? So if I'm okay with my neighbor keeping a slave and maybe ill keep one myself idk, I'm not pro-slavery? I'm pro-choice? \n\n\n>Wrong :) \n\nExplain why thats wrong? Does it not matter to you if it's a human life you're killing?\n\n\n>Its actually incredibly easy in my state. \n\nGood for you, which state?\n\n\n>You lose either way :)\n\n850,000+ children lose annually in the US alone, and you're bragging about it. Our ability to dehumanize other humans is staggering and disgusting.",

IE, you took away the choice. Cant read huh? \n\n>If you aren't against it, you're for it.\u00a0\n\nSorry George Bush, thats not how it works ;)\n\n>Well, besides you not knowing me personally\n\nNo need to. You right wingers are all the same, theres no uniqueness in ya. \n\n>The question at hand is what is a human life\n\nWrong :) the question is \"Do Republicans really want to take away womens rights or not\". Simple as that. \n\n>I think its nuts what women have to do in this country to get a mastectomy. They should absolutely have more body autonomy over their body\n\nIts actually incredibly easy in my state. You must be referring to how your state already limits womens bodily autonomy. \n\n>They just don't have the right to kill a separate human life inside of them.\n\nGood thing abortion isnt about killing. And abortion will always be legal in abohtnhalf the states :)\n\nAnd guess what? We can just mail abortion pills to people in red states for around $5, so abortion will still happen. Or, they just hop the state borders and get it done.\n\nYou lose either way :) You also lose the right to respond, ive owned you enough and you have no value in your life, so no reason to keep embarrassing you.

But the conclusion you're reaching (that some incinerators use fetuses to make power) **assumes** that at least some of those incinerators which are used to make power must also use medical waste as fuel. I'm not arguing that it doesn't happen, mind you, just that it's not a logical conclusion to say that it **must** be true.\n\nRegardless, as I said before, seems like a good use of material to me :)",

People seem to think that there are medical waste treatment plants out there burning waste as fuel and generating electricity from the burned waste. This is not the case. There are waste treatment plants out there burning waste *by combusting fuels like natural gas* and then using the left-over heat to power turbines to generate electricity. These processes can have *up to* 84% energy recovery efficiency, but they still aren't generating power (it's in section 4). \n\nThere is [one proposal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/463/1/012180) for building a pyrolyzer-rankine power plant in the Philippines, which the study claims could have up to 400% efficiency, actually producing power. However, I can't find anything that indicates that any medical waste pyrolyzer-rankine power plants currently actually *exist*.",

I still eat hamburger and turn on the lights. There's way worse stuff in the stuff we use everyday if you want to frame everything as horrible, like cosmetics with animal rights and executed prisoners from China.

A big area of waste this is done for is medical, for sterilisation reasons, and that includes, in many countries, anything leftover from abortions. \n\nBy nowadays I mean easily at least the last ten years, I only know about this at all cuz it was a minor scandal in the UK back in like 2014 or so. Obviously cremation/burial is also an option and no-ones doing this for the express purpose of generating excess energy.",
