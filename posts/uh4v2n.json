      "text": "Our foster care system is underfunded and broken. Many states have little or inaccessible prenatal care. And on top of that, many women do not have great or any health insurance. We are constantly reducing the budget for WIC and SNAP. According to No Kid Hungry, 13 million children live in food insecure households right now. Wages have not gone up. Rent and food costs are up. Childcare costs are burdensome and for many, unaffordable. \n\nMany companies do not care for or support a working mother's lack of flexibility (someone has to pick up their child from school, stay home if they're sick, take them to doctor's appointments, etc.). There is a teacher shortage. And there are men and women out there who should NOT become parents because they are either mentally ill, addicted to drugs, abusive, or simply lack maturity. \n\nI seriously doubt that our elected officials are going to start making sure there are more hospitals/gynecologists to support the increase in pregnancies and increase funding and resources to our safety nets and foster care system. Teacher salaries won't be increased to draw in more teachers. Childcare costs will continue to skyrocket unchecked. Universal healthcare is a pipe dream, so many women will be stuck with the astronomical medical bills associated with childbirth (or will die from lack of prenatal care when more at risk pregnancies fall through the cracks). Child protective services are severely understaffed too. \n\nWe are going to see a rise in poverty, food insecurity, women leaving the workforce (economy will take a hit), the amount of children aging out of foster care, child abuse, maternal mortality, homelessness. Not to mention women who will be trapped with their rapist's baby or in a domestic violence relationship when their husband forces them to have their baby. Women who will die from back alley abortions. But all this suffering would only BRiNG uS ClOsER tO GOd. So I guess it's ok.",

A small government proponent typically wants the government to protect people from enemies/criminals, provide courts to resolve disputes, and not much else.\n\nPeople on Reddit will cry hypocrisy every time a Republican wants the government to do anything, saying that position is inconsistent with wanting small government.  They seem to think that the only way to advocate for small government is to choose gocernment inaction at every opportunity.\n\nBut that's not the case--it's only inconsistent with the Reddit strawman version of the small government position.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nRepublican:  The government should arrest murderers.\n\nRedditor:  Oh, you want the government to do something, so much for being the party of small government.\n\nMe, explaining:  Wanting the government to arrest murderers is perfectly consistet with the small government position because protecting people from criminals is clearly a proper area for the government to operate.  Sure, the government would do less work if it did not arrest murderers, but that doesn't mean that a small government advocate must take the position that the government shouldn't arrest murderers.",

It's first in a list that he references about important rulings overturning previous ones, commenting on how *Obergefell* overturned *Baker v Nelson*.  It's worth noting that Alito dissented in *Obergefell*, and uses much of the same justification for his dissent here as he did there: that it is not a right granted by the Constitution, and it goes against history and tradition.\n\nDon't get your hopes up, though.  Congress could enact an anti-gay law and overrule the Supreme Court.  The old guard Republicans may have stayed away from abortion and anti-gay laws to keep their base riled up, but the new Republican playbook has dozens of things to keep the crazy going.  They don't need to avoid them, anymore.  I would not be shocked if they start to put out the kind of laws we're seeing in the conservative states as national laws if the Republicans win the midterms.  If nothing else, I can only hope that this result gets the sleeping voters to wake up and win places that the Republicans thought they had gerrymandered in their favor.",

In my friend group of 20 somethings, I think 2 voted for Trump, 5 voted third party, 4 didn't vote, and 6 voted for Clinton.

I think most of these Fascists don\u2019t believe at all, it\u2019s just a tool for them to gain power. \n\n\nI\u2019m gonna copy paste a previous comment I made about this and how they actually are fascists, maybe it\u2019ll resonate:\n\n\nUnfortunately, the term Fascist has been used in a generic pejorative way for so long that people have forgotten what it actually is. These people, the Republican Party and their supporters, are Fascist.\n\n\nCheck out the tenets sections and it seems self evident that this party, these policies, are Fascist. Granted that there\u2019s not a universally agreed upon definition, but these people and their desired State conform to pretty much all of them.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism\n\n\nOne of my favorite definitions is (and they\u2019re pretty much all along these lines):\n> \u201c[Fascism is] a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.\u201d\n\n\nDoes any of this ring a bell?\n\n\n> Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete. They regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. A fascist state is led by a strong leader (such as a dictator) and a martial law government composed of the members of the governing fascist party to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views imperialism, political violence and war as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.\n\n\nRemember when they actually staged a violent coup and basically nothing happened? Those people were lauded as national heroes by this ilk.\nThese people, this political apparatus they\u2019ve so successfully implemented, is a direct and immediate threat to liberty and democracy.\n\n\nOh, and let\u2019s not think they\u2019re doing it \u201cfor the children\u201d. Once they\u2019re forced to be born, they claim they can just go up for adoption, oh wait they want to cut basically all social programs. Sorry kiddo, no guaranteed healthcare (this one\u2019s obvious), education (the don\u2019t say gay bill was as much anti LGBTQ+ as it was to bankrupt the public school system in favor of their private, unregulated charter schools), housing (we have a huge homeless problem), or food (they hate welfare and shit all over anyone on \u201cfood stamps\u201d).\n\n\nOh, and let\u2019s not forget so many others they give fuck all for, like people of color (they fucking glorify police violence against them, blue lives matter, fuck off), anyone who\u2019s not heteronormative (I bet gay rights are going away real soon, which is ironic considering the number of republican-aligned male-only  clergy who get caught fucking little boys), or anyone who is poor (even though somehow they\u2019ve convinced a large swathe of lower-/middle-class people to vote against their own best interests)\u2026 the list just keeps going.\n\n\nOne last thing I\u2019ll mention is to note that, if (when) they actually succeed at a coup, guess which side has all the guns? Probably the ones who ejac all over the second amendment printed on their shitty, single-ply toilet paper, completely unaware of the irony of their beliefs relative to its purpose.\n\n\nOk, I\u2019ll stop my rant, but I won\u2019t stop being furious at these fucking Fascists.",

If the big G doesn't want you running around getting people pregnant than clearly it's his will and we shouldn't interfere with erectile disfunction meds.   Let's block  them too. \n\nAnd since it's the state telling women they have to bear children no matter what then the woman's health care and pre-natal care should be state funded and any medical issues she is left with after birth is also covered by the state.  Just like paternity... If the state wants the baby it should damn well do the responsible thing and pay for it. \n\nI know neither of these fix the stolen agency for women in controlling their own bodies, but it seems that a little quid pro quo might make certain people stop and think.",

          "text": "Latching onto top comment to post this:\n\nIf this decision were to be properly protested, there would be no way it could ever be enforced. Lets say THEORETICALLY a given state makes abortion illegal.\n\nIf every single left wing woman were to have a pregnancy and abortion in some clinic's books (only have the pregnancy and procedure done on paper, even if it didn't actually happen), then refuse to pay any fines or show up in court, there is no way the system could handle it. Even if we say 50% of left wing women (lets just say 12.5% of the population) participated in this protest method the same would happen.\n\n1. Prisons are already near or at capacity in most places. This is with roughly under 2% of our population in jail or prison. You could say that anyone not willing to comply would be thrown in prison but adding 12.5% or more of the population to that would simply be impossible. House arrest would be the next possible choice but if every single participant refused to comply, it would be unenforceable. If you try to use either the threat of military or police force using weapons to enforce it, you would effectively either start a civil war, or a massacre that would destroy the credibility of the government for a long time. \n\n2. The court system would be backed up for ages. Even if they were to backpedal, revert this decision, and decide to throw out every single case, they would still need to go through the documents for every single case and effectively destroy the court's ability to go through cases until its all processed. \n\n\nBasically what I'm saying is:\n\nIf your state passes anti abortion laws, do the following:\n\nTransfer all money and things of monetary value to spouse, parents, siblings, or put it in investments or offshore accounts. Make sure you have nothing of monetary value that can be seized by the gov.\n\nOrganize with other left-wing women and do the same.\n\nSay you're pregnant and go to an abortion clinic willing to put a fake abortion on the books. Then make sure as many people as possible know you \"got an abortion\". \n\nRefuse to comply with any court summons relating to the matter. \n\nWatch as the entire system fails trying to deal with the sheer number that is 12.5 to 25% of the population.",

Between a right wing party and a so-right-wing-it-makes-Atilla-the-hun-nervous party?\n\nI personally think it is mostly folks who are trying to decide if one issue they care about is important enough to buy into the shite.  I.e. undecided voters are people trying to talk themselves into something they know is wrong for single issue or selfish reasons.  \n\nThat is why the \"all politicians are the same/corrupt/etc \" narrative is so damaging.  It is specifically aimed at alleviating the guilt of voting for republicans on a single issue basis.",

Your new health problems will come with more bills. More children will be given up for adoption, becoming actual wards of the state (because what this world needs is more unwanted children) and increasing the tax burden on everyone. At which point, the monsters that forced you to give birth will bitch about how taxes are too high and they want to cut funding because \"some women couldn't keep their legs closed.\"\n\nFuck these people.",

Not all stages of fetal development would be considered a \"clump of cells\". \n\nSecondly, I agree that the brain argument is the strongest one to make. Neural development of the fetus starts occuring more rapidly around 12ish weeks, which is also when corticothalamic connections begin to develop. These are involved in pain recognition. \n\nSo my question to you is at what point should a woman be limited in her bodily autonomy over that of the fetus?",

So now we're in a situation where 5,000 Native American voters might not be able to vote in the 2018 elections with their tribal ID cards.\n\n>So there is a tremendous amount of fear in North Dakota that many Native Americans are not going to be able to vote in this state\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2018/10/23/659784277/republican-voter-suppression-efforts-are-targeting-minorities-journalist-says\n\n>#Hack The Vote\n\n>Early this year Bev Harris, who is writing a book on voting machines, found Diebold software -- which the company refuses to make available for public inspection -- on an unprotected server, where anyone could download it. (The software was in a folder titled ''rob-Georgia.zip.'') The server was used by employees of Diebold Election Systems to update software on its machines. This in itself was an incredible breach of security, offering someone who wanted to hack into the machines both the information and the opportunity to do so.\n\n>For example, Georgia -- where Republicans scored spectacular upset victories in the 2002 midterm elections -- relies exclusively on Diebold machines. But there is also no evidence that the machines counted correctly. \n\n>What we do know about Diebold does not inspire confidence. The details are technical, but they add up to a picture of a company that was, at the very least, extremely sloppy about security, and may have been trying to cover up product defects.\n\n>Meanwhile, leaked internal Diebold e-mail suggests that corporate officials knew their system was flawed, and circumvented tests that would have revealed these problems. The company hasn't contested the authenticity of these documents; instead, it has engaged in legal actions to prevent their dissemination.\n\n>Why isn't this front-page news? In October, a British newspaper, The Independent, ran a hair-raising investigative report on U.S. touch-screen voting. But while the mainstream press has reported the basics, the Diebold affair has been treated as a technology or business story -- not as a potential political scandal.\n\n>This diffidence recalls the treatment of other voting issues, like the Florida ''felon purge'' that inappropriately prevented many citizens from voting in the 2000 presidential election. \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/02/opinion/hack-the-vote.html\n\n>#Thousands of Black Votes in Georgia Disappeared\n\n>On July 7, 2017, according to court documents in the case, Curling v. Kemp (pdf), someone wiped the state\u2019s election server clean.\n\n>Then they wiped the backup server.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/02/opinion/hack-the-vote.html\n\nhttps://www.theroot.com/exclusive-thousands-of-black-votes-in-georgia-disappea-1832472558",

But I think everyone really needs to reckon with the fact that it's not really red states v. blue states so much as it's cities v. rural areas, and try to find a political system that respects the rights of urbanites and makes progress on environmental issues while not (completely) reducing rural dwellers to second-class citizens.

      "text": "This happens always when you give power to religious people anywhere in the world. No matter if it's Poland, Iran, Saudi-Arabia, Russia or United States. **Whenever religious people decide, the rights of women and minorities are getting crushed.** Religion is always the enemy of civil rights. You can't have liberty AND religion. If you allow Jesus into politics, he takes away the rights of women.\n\nThis also proves that many religious people always put their religion ahead of actual human. Whatever they think their God wants is more important than actual humans. **They shouldn't be able to call themselves \"pro-life\" since not having a right to do abortion leads to death of women**. If you don't have a right to do safe abortion, the mortality of women most likely rises. Because abortions don't just stop if you make them illegal. They just get worse and more dangerous. Anybody can learn how bad thing abortion is if it is not done in safe and clean environment by a professional. These pro-life people are sentencing women to death.\n\nWith this religion also proves how anti-sex it is. The believers think that sex something you do only if you try to get children. Otherwise it's a dirty and bad thing. They don't want people enjoying sex. They want instead prohibition, purity culture and shaming of those who don't live their personal lives in Christian way. **Of course the religious \"pro-life\" group is also against LGBT-rights and always tries to make being gay illegal.**\n\n**And religion is always patriarchal.** Banning abortion is one way of forcing women to submit. If a woman gets pregnant, she is forced into a life of mother. And traditionally pregnancy has been the single most important way of controlling women and their bodies. This is what feminists have always talked about. By impregnating women, men can force them out of work. Abortion ban gives also rapists way of having control over their victims.\n\n**All these things come from religion**. This is an issue of religion vs. human rights. We can see what happens when religion wins that fight. Sadly it seems that it is happening again. Again the rights of human beings is threatened in large part of the world. If US falls, the same thing will happen in many other countries as well. Next it'll be Europe. It won't end in just overturning of Roe v. Wade. It'll go on until we go back into Middle Ages and absolute power of religion.\n\n**If I didn't hate religion before, I sure hate it now. With fucking passion.**",

Forced school prayers? \nThe same people who said it was against their rights to make them wear a mask are now wanting to force women to have kids they don't want, can't afford, or will kill them. \nMany women will die trying to have secret abortions. Abortions won't stop, they will go under ground. The poor will be unequally affected as they won't have the money to fly some where to get it done.\nAbortion pills will become the new drug traded in on the black market and back alleys. The morning after pill will be sold like your mother's Oxycontin. \nThe forced birth crowd will be over joyed with this but they do not care about children. If they did, they would make healthcare a priority, they would make sexual education the normal, they would make helping young women get and use birth control, they would help with daycare as most women who abort have no way to take care of a baby while working. \nRape victims forced to have babies with their rapist. Women will be forced to carry their sick, disabled, or dead fetuses to term. \nOnly a matter of time until some woman is charged for a miscarriage that some quack will claim is an abortion. \nThis country is going backwards. At this rate it, we will be having to use different water fountains.",

      "text": "Unfortunately, the term Fascist has been used in a generic pejorative way for so long that people have forgotten what it actually is. These people, the Republican Party and their supporters, are Fascist.\n\n\nCheck out the tenets sections and it seems self evident that this party, these policies, are Fascist. Granted that there\u2019s not a universally agreed upon definition, but these people and their desired State conform to pretty much all of them.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism\n\n\nOne of my favorite definitions is (and they\u2019re pretty much all along these lines):\n> \u201c[Fascism is] a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation, or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion.\u201d\n\n\nDoes any of this ring a bell?\n\n\n> Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete. They regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. A fascist state is led by a strong leader (such as a dictator) and a martial law government composed of the members of the governing fascist party to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views imperialism, political violence and war as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.\n\n\nRemember when they actually staged a violent coup and basically nothing happened? Those people were lauded as national heroes by this ilk.\nThese people, this political apparatus they\u2019ve so successfully implemented, is a direct and immediate threat to liberty and democracy.\n\n\nOh, and let\u2019s not think they\u2019re doing it \u201cfor the children\u201d. Once they\u2019re forced to be born, they claim they can just go up for adoption, oh wait they want to cut basically all social programs. Sorry kiddo, no guaranteed healthcare (this one\u2019s obvious), education (the don\u2019t say gay bill was as much anti LGBTQ+ as it was to bankrupt the public school system in favor of their private, unregulated charter schools), housing (we have a huge homeless problem), or food (they hate welfare and shit all over anyone on \u201cfood stamps\u201d).\n\n\nOh, and let\u2019s not forget so many others they give fuck all for, like people of color (they fucking glorify police violence against them, blue lives matter, fuck off), anyone who\u2019s not heteronormative (I bet gay rights are going away real soon, which is ironic considering the number of republican-aligned male-only  clergy who get caught fucking little boys), or anyone who is poor (even though somehow they\u2019ve convinced a large swathe of lower-/middle-class people to vote against their own best interests)\u2026 the list just keeps going.\n\n\nOne last thing I\u2019ll mention is to note that, if (when) they actually succeed at a coup, guess which side has all the guns? Probably the ones who ejac all over the second amendment printed on their shitty, single-ply toilet paper, completely unaware of the irony of their beliefs relative to its purpose.\n\n\nOk, I\u2019ll stop my rant, but I won\u2019t stop being furious at these fucking Fascists.",

I get that it opens up a risk that you open up yourself to changing your stance on an issue or being wrong, but the only way to get others to take a risk on changing their mind is to risk having your own mind changed as well. \n\nYou may say that you wish for abortion to be legal, but if your actions are not increasing the likelihood of getting that, and in fact might even be working against abortion being legal, then it stands to reason that you actually care about protecting your own inflated self-righteousnes much more than about the legal status of abortion.\n\nDo you want to bring people to your side or do you just want to feel smug?",

No practical analysis of what this would mean at the state and Federal level, and how it can be handled legislatively in various jurisdictions. Just hysterics, hyperbole, and Handmaid's Tale doomwanking. \n\nSCOTUS opinion draft: \"We're going to relegate this abortion decision back to the individual states, because we don't find that there is Constitutional standing for this ruling to exist at the federal level, and it's not like the legislative branch ever did their jobs and passed a federal law protecting it in the first place.\"\n\nR/atheism: \"Waarrrrgrrrbl, this is the end! This relinquishing of Federal authority over everyone's uterus is exactly how the Federal government seizes complete and total control of everyone's uterus and becomes a Christian theocracy under Joe Biden!\"\n\nListen to yourselves. Maybe when you folks actually start discussing the real world ramifications of this potential decision, and looking at how it could play out, at both the state and the federal level going forward, instead of simply dissolving rapidly into a shrieking puddle of hysterics, it would be possible to take you seriously. Until then, this lack of serious dialogue is just emotional red meat for the (D) base.",

There's no national desire for an ACTUAL abortion ban along Republican representatives who want to keep their jobs, they just talk about it to get votes and donations.\n\n Conversely, there's no national courage to pass federal abortion protection law among Democrat representatives who want to keep their jobs.
