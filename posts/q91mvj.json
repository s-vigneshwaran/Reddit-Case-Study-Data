And if they're not, then you'll just imagine they are.\n\nYou're pretty good at creating a strawman, and that way you'll face less challenge, and we'll be rid of your nonsense.\n\nSo go argue with a wall, please.",

Had Rittenhouse not fired the initial shots, a giant crowd would not have chased him. If he had dropped his gun as he ran away, the crowd likely would have eventually just left him alone. Maybe some punches would have been thrown but not anything close to lethal. Probably not even serious injury. Rose Baum goes for his own gun which does not save him unlike what 2A nutters like the believe. Gun escalate things. Once someone sees a gun it becomes a life or death situation to them and they react to that. Having a gun actually increases your chances of getting shot for this exact reason. Now, it is not so unbelievable that Rittenhouse would have shot someone even if he didn\u2019t see a gun but it is very obvious that during this situation there were several times when something that should have ended with maybe some yelling and shoving escalated because of a gun.",

They had no intention to rob the place and had no weapon on them. But in a moment of idiocy they pretended their hand in their pocket was a gun, and robbed the place....  If during the robbery a patron had a seizure (stressful situation) and fell, hit their head & died - that's felony murder.  \n\n\nIf the person who died, died of an unrelated condition  (nothing to do with the robbery) - maybe they were already having a heart attack & didn't know it. If that person died \\*\\*during\\*\\* the robbery or right after ... it's felony murder just because of WHEN it happened.   \n\n\nAnd if our robber has a friend with them... a friend who has no clue about the robbery and is not a participant - both of them get charged (and most likely convicted) of felony murder.",

Knowing that \"armed individuals\" would be there and had plans is not the same thing as knowing that this specific person would be there, you really need to stop pretending that it is. This excerpt helps *me* in this more than it does you lmfao. \"Oh yeah, nobodys saying that huh?? Well heres an example of someone not saying that, so THERE!\"\n\nLike I'm not 100% behind what he's saying or anything, and have not once said otherwise even though you keep trying to argue against the time that I apparently said otherwise, but misrepresenting what people are saying helps nobody.",

The first is \"so you figure\" which is obviously a rhetorical question with the answer assumed. Otherwise, its an almost entirely irrelevant question, asked for no reason.

I LITERALLY didn't even say that you stated a belief or opinion. Jesus fucking christ dude. Are you reading the same comments that I'm typing? At all?\n\nI'm fucking done here. Let me know if you want to have a grown-up conversation, wherein one person says something, then the other person responds to what was said, then the first person responds to that.
