Most people are alright, treating the youngsters in the group with kid gloves.\n\nBut then there\u2019s this fucking douchebag. Guy had to be in his early 30\u2019s, and pretty well built. This motherfucker jumps into the small pit and just starts throwing punches and shit. There are literal children in this crowd, but he didn\u2019t care. I ended up getting elbowed in the face pretty hard by this scumbag and ended up on the ground. Nobody bothered stopping to help, so I\u2019m just huddled up trying not to get stepped on until my brother who brought me to the show saw me and came to get me out of there. So that was what I assumed mosh pits were for the longest time.\n\nA few years later, I got invited to a metal festival. I liked some metal at the time, but I definitely wasn\u2019t a part of the culture. I see a mosh pit form nearby during one of the sets and think \u201cfuuuuuuck that\u201d, but my friend that brought me with made a beeline right for it, so I figure I needed to be there when people really started fucking each other up. I wasn\u2019t going to let my friend get hurt. What I saw was a bunch of people who were way into the music knocking each other down and picking each other back up. So I jumped in, got shoved around, fell over, got picked up, and had the time of my fucking life. To all the real ones in the metal scene, thank you. That\u2019s still one of my favorite concert moments I\u2019ve ever had.",

I really do, but that doesn't give you the right to call \"basic\" a person who's only being nice to you. What kind of message are you sending? Just the wrong one, I'm afraid. \n\nI grew up on the '90 between Spain and Venezuela, and while my share of scars made me cruel, I refuse to keep being like that. I cannot tell you how to live your life, but from experience, I can tell you that being obnoxious will only leave a trail of loneliness. And nobody deserves to be lonely. \n\nIf it's worth something, I apologize for the whole \"crayon\" stuff. It was out of place and unnecessary. But I won't deny that's how I am: \"*Give me a flower and I will give you a garden; Give me a bullet and I will give you a war\"*\n\nYou don't have to reply if you don't want to.

I meant to be funny. \n\nIt seems we both misinterpreted each other\u2019s comments.\n\nI could explain the way I took your original comment, but i understand now it just boils down to me being an American. So again, I apologize. And truly thank you for the compliment. \n\nMy response about crayons was supposed to be friendly and funny, basically saying \u201cyou\u2019re right, I\u2019m not the brightest crayon in the pack with regard to misinterpreting your compliment, and my apology was and is sincere. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely cultural difference that is causing the misinterpretations of meaning between us. \n\nBasically, I\u2019m trying my damndest to say \u201cyou\u2019re absolutely right. I\u2019m sorry, and thank you for the compliment.\u201d I just think my attempts to be funny failed miserably. I should have been more clear. I\u2019m sorry for that.",

Still, I think you're awesome and I have deep respect for your country, which is now my home. \n\nComing from different cultures is an issue, one that stills haunts me. Sometimes making a joke can detonate a thermonuclear conflict. Hell, even my couple have a hard time to keep me on line sometimes. \n\nTalking of respect, I think this is the first time I found someone who took their time to write on such a wholeheartedly way. It's not easy to apologize, I must admit. I respect you for your take in this situation, color me impressed! \n\nOh, and about my first comment to you... I said you're a person of culture (meaning you have a good taste) 'cause I know the band you recommend it and it's totally awesome!  After my comment I was hoping to recommend some of my faves, like the latest three albums of *Leaves' Eyes*. ...There's no blood on my veins, just a symphony of liquid metal. \n\nIn any case, I got your message loud and clear, and I accept your apology with open arms and a warm heart.

So it\u2019s incredibly niche.\n\nWe\u2019ll use rap as our soccer analog. Rap (at least in the past) sees more people from poorer upbringings rising in popularity, \u2018cause it doesn\u2019t take more than a pen and a voice to make. \n\nMetal kinda by definition requires electric guitars, amps, drums, etc. So you\u2019ve gotta have the means to get all that stuff. Hence places with better standard of living are gonna have more of it. \n\nOr I\u2019m completely insane and just rambling.",

There were two groups, ones who followed euronymous and those who followed varg. while yes, while the two were friends, euronymous and varg both committed church bombings and burnings, towards the end euronymous pulled back and started focusing on making money and having fun. varg became extremely angry and basically called euronymous a poser (while following euronymous\u2019 teachings lol). This caused the entirety of the circle to split into two. Euronymous tried to bring varg into mayhem as the bassist to reign him in and assert power over him, but the two eventually came to a split.\n\nEventually, Varg got word of a joke euronymous had made about murdering him. Shortly after varg got word, he received a contract in the mail from Euronymous that would separate Vargs solo project from deathlike silence records, the record company euronymous owned. \n\nVarg used this as an excuse to say that euronymous was plotting to trap him and murder him. He then drove to Euronymous\u2019 apartment in Oslo and murdered him, all while trying to claim self defense.\n\nSo it was mainly Varg\u2019s group in the circle that committed the crimes, and it was varg who ruined everything.",

That sounds like a good thing. \n\nAlternatively in a trainwreck society like America you have either people completely at war with each other just to survive, or alternatively the ever increasing population of escapists that refuse to participate in society and withdraw into online gaming an other \"alternate\" realities while parasitically surviving. VR is only getting bigger, MMOs are making a comeback.\n\nThe whole NEET/hikkikomori phenomenon isn't exclusive to Japan anymore. It's hitting Western society like a freight train and our media is trying to suppress it. Crazy work hours and suicides are wacky news when it's coming from Asia. But when it's happening to us, and we've even surpassed Japan when it comes to work hours, it stops making cute news blurbs. Also we'll blame suicide on just about anything else. Meanwhile Japan, while still rough, has made a conscious effort to scale back, putting us comparatively in an even more apprehensible position.\n\nIt's basic game design. If a game is too difficult or unfair then a good portion of players will refuse to interact. Then the people that defend the system or grind just dig themselves deeper by appearing like they huff massive quantities of copium. \n\nI'd much rather we have fringe bored artists making great music than a society of homicidal people that want to kill each other because they can't afford rent or doctor visits. At least kill each other because you're bored or need an album cover. \n\nBut the outlook for UBI or universal healthcare seems grim when the people running the show are really just executives protecting personal profit.",

Jobs give people the ability to both struggle, achieve something, and serve society. These are all deep and intrinsict human needs. UBI people have yet to come up with any kind of alternative way to meet these needs, and either ignore them or engage in naive fantasies. Too much freedom is also very bad because it leads to people without a sense of purpose (part of the reason there's so many driftless 20 and 30 something's now).",

We also have a wierd half tax month in December.\n\nIt's way less flexible than just having paid leave, because the employer only has to make one payment a year. \nSay you wanna take half your vacay in February, and the the rest in summer. Your employer can give you an advance on the holiday pay, but is not obligated to. So in most cases you'll have 2,5 weeks without pay deducted in your next pay check. Ouch.\nYou'll still receive the full 12% later but it's just, sorta lame.\n\n\nWhen you quit you have a right to have all of your accumulated holiday pay paid out to you on the last paycheck. Or you can leave it and your ex employer will pay it out the following June when they make the payments for the other employees.\n\nI think there's some tax benefit for leaving it, but i don't completely remember the technicalities of that.",

Right away I got chemo, I went to surgery to remove the cancer, the surgical doctor was one of europes best surgical doctors in sarcoma cancer removal. I got prosthetic in my shoulder worth 10s of thousand of dollar (that's what the doctor said). Since then I've been on sick leave and every month I get 2000 dollar from the government and you what my medical bill is? Zero.\n\nI'm originally from Kurdistan, my family moved here in the 90s due the Iraq-Iran war. I will be forever grateful for my parents for having the courage to escape from the war and I will forever be grateful for Sweden for giving my family a future and for literally saving my life without demanding that I pay pack. Because of Sweden my sister is now a psychologist and I have degree in business administration and I have zero debt (school is free in Sweden, but you can get student loan if you want. I decided to work instead). I am now slowly trying to get back to life and searching for a job and I will  happily  pay my taxes so that someone else can get the same chance as I did when they get sick.\n\nI am a huge US fanatic I did a roadtrip in the US 2014 and I loved every second of it. I hope that you will be able to get your free health care and education some day the same way that we have in Sweden.\nPeace",

I think many Europeans (and Americans) hope for a more functioning American state.\n\nTo make a simile: I'm fond of Russia and China, but I think the regimes that rule those countries are terrible. China has a proud 4000 year history. Russia is the cultured bridge between East and West, North and South. Yet both countries are plagued by dictators.\n\nThe US is in a much better state of course, but we still want you to improve. I think many Europeans have this image in their heads of how we think the US was in the 1900s - wild, exciting, a trusted partner, a country of opportunity, invention, music, movies, Hollywood, New York, hamburgers, cars, and everything. The American dream. Nowadays, we still love *Americans*, but I'm not so sure about the USA.",

These things generally don't work the way you describe. \n\nGenerally I've noticed that people who have never dealt with immigration or even visas rarely have a clue how these things work and grossly underestimate their difficulties. \n\nNorway is a first world country and therefore a highly desirable place to live, even for other first world citizens. This means that immigration laws are generally strict and a sentence like this \"as long as you have something to offer, I see no reason why you shouldn't be able **to just come**\" is reality-detached. Nobody \"just comes\" to stay legally in a place like Norway. \n\nYou can't just immigrate to Norway as an American. There are requirements, and outside of family ties, it probably requires you to have a variety of things, including a job in Norway, solid income, etc.",

Not in the least.\nBut our province is the joke of the world right now, so I think it's okay to feel the way I feel.\n\nYou know, over 250 doctors have moved to a different province because of our health system budget cutbacks last year. Reducing patient appointments to 15 minutes. Doctors lost their front staff. Had to do their own filing, ect...\n\nHe didn't stop there though; Why not lower wages of nurses pay during a massive pandemic while we're at it. Give them a big slap in the face. Take away teachers pensions, as well. As soon as he implemented this, he disappeared for vacation and our school boards were left with no direction. A lot of teachers are ready to quit.\n\nLet's see. What else...\nWell, he decided no more contact tracing. We did have it but our provinces premiere is a fucking douche. So no longer will we be able to keep track of covid spreading. Covid tests now have to be paid for out of pocket.\nOur ICU is overrun with antivaxxers who wanted a fucking rodeo for the summer. We had to get the ARMY in to help our hospitals.\n\nEvery day there is another story about people with cancer, tumors suffocating their throat, having their surgery canceled indefinitely(yup) because our hospitals are shot. A nurse killed herself the other day for Godsake. She couldn't handle the workload and the nonsense.\n\nAlso they're at a point of triage. So who gets to live? The old man who was vaxxed or the youngster who didn't get vaccinated. It is FUCKED.\n\nMy surgery consult wait time went from 3 months to a year because of this.\nSo after my consult is a NOW 3-4 yr wait time.\nI get to be sick, in pain, miserable, see the same walls every day for 5 years now. Because of fucking Canada and their health system.\n\nSo no, this Canadian is not happy.",

Or more than bandaid solutions. \n\nI wouldn't have almost died if they did a simple ultrasound on my stomach during the 7 or 8 years of complaining about stomach pains. I was told over and over it was IBS. This was not true. \n\nThe reason I'm not well still, why I seem to be getting worse: they put me on penicillin for 2 years straight when I was 8 or 9yrs old to combat my chronic strep throat(why not remove my fucking tonsils?)\n\nNow I'm allergic to penicillin and need my anodes, tonsils and 2 lymphnodes removed. I had strep 2 times a year my whole life. I don't get why they wouldn't just remove my fucking tonsils instead of prescribing. I asked them so many times and they would say it's too dangerous, you have a high risk of internal bleeding once you're past a certain age.\nSo let's just let me get visibly worse for the rest of my life til my body can't handle life anymore. \n\nSorry man.

It's also interesting to note that Georgia as one of the lowest rates for a red state, and they also have one of the highest population densities for a red state. This would probably require some in-depth statistical analysis.\n\nStates with lower population density tend to be more Republican-leaning, where is those that have a higher population density tend to be more Democratic-leaning. This is where it's important to understand the difference between causation and correlation. Does being a Republican or in a Republican area cause a higher suicide rate, or is it simply that the two phenomena are moved together buy a third phenomenon? Or perhaps it's just coincidental?",

Suddenly they need 50x more staff, and may need to pull supply from various new vendors instead of just their main supplier.

Typical proposed explanations include economical or environmental facotrs, but these have not gained a strong foothold in the academia. A more satisfactory explanation for why happiness and suicides tend to occur together is that people assess their own welfare in relation to others: A depressed person may become even more depressed when is surrounded by happy people.\n\nThis expalanation is well in line with the branch of economics research that studies the relation between wealth and happiness across different countries. The overarching finding is that it's not the absolute level of wealth that matters for happiness, but the wealth relative to other countrymen.\n\nBy the way, the paradox of high rates of suicide in happy places can be observed *within* countries as well, not just between them. For instance, if you compare the different states in the US, there is a positive relation between perceived happiness and suicide rates!",

Needed money for food, drugs, a roof over your head, getting health care etc. Most people have a limit to how low they could go before they took matters into their own hands. Desperate people do desperate things, and that scare other people. It makes for a society where you might be afraid of your fellow person, that they might take something from you, or even hurt you. So the logical thinking seems to be get a weapon for protection, but is it? It just leads to an arms race on a personal level nationwide.\n\nWhat if the state took care of those that are in need, before they get desperate? Then you potentially have reduced the need for some to do things to others that others dont want done to them. Most people dont want to be criminals or do desperate acts. Then there is less reason to be scared of your fellow person, and no reason to carry a weapon.\n\nIn the aftermath of last weeks killings in Norway there was a lot of threads on Reddit about how the psychotic person could have been stopped if only citizens carried guns. On the flip side of that is how many people could he have killed if he had a gun as well. All the deaths were due to knife, not bow and arrow as first reported. This argument goes to all the mass killings in Europe in the last decade, it is mostly done with knifes or cars. The death toll would probably be a lot higher if we had more guns around. There are a lot of hunting weapons, but those are rarely involved in anything but suicide or killing of significant other.\n\nI fell off on another path there, but the point being. Norway, the scandinavian countries, and europe in general are safe and peaceful due to the reason that we have a mentality of caring for others. Care for others and you dont have to be scared of them. Then everybody can go about their day without any worries.",

Less evolved neurological structure. \n\nBasically, if you've got a Neanderthal brain in a modem world, you're going to be triggered, frightened, and reactive ALL the time because things are too stimulating, varied, and complex for you.\n\nIt's not unique to America. We've seen resurgences of nationalism and creepy regressive thinking all over the world in recent years. And of course, you've got dictatorships that embody that thinking and brainwash their people. It's the same thing. But, Americans think they're free and they use their freedom of speech to parrot all that brainwashing. They didn't come up with it.\n\nI also think it's so obvious in America because of our historical baggage, but also because America is incredibly diverse and varied, so it's extra challenging for the knuckle-draggers here (Japan is intensely racist, but it's less obvious in a racially homogeneous country). Put that together with rampant corruption and weak regulation and you've got billions being made by whipping idiots into a frenzy and pointing that angry block at your product/social issue/legislation/candidate, etc. All so a few can profit at the expense of many.\n\nMost Americans want progressive change, but our system is badly rigged.

They were in trade DEFICIT with regards to oil according to your source. \n\nFrom Wikipedia: \"Unlike most of its neighbours, Denmark has not had extractable deposits of minerals or fossil fuels, except for the deposits of oil and natural gas in the North Sea, which started playing an economic role only during the 1980s.\" Starting from the 80s oil has played some role in the economy. If you look at GDP annual growth, it was bigger before 80s than it has been after it. At absolute maximum oil has been 4% of Gross Value Added in 2006. Denmark was a wealthy welfare country before that. \n\nNow do Iceland, Finland and Sweden! I am interested to see your mental acrobatics with those countries.\n\nBtw, what is ag?",

While it may seem nice and like something to strive for, sadly due to human nature something like this will most certainly never happen. Regardless of the government, capitalistic free market, socialism, communism, etc, there will ALWAYS be a form of oppression and deprivation. This has always been true and will always be true. \n\nAt least in capitalism it\u2019s harder to enforce and maintain and easier to identify and resist. If a people doesn\u2019t like the influence of an individual, simply stop partaking in the goods or service they provide. Understandably some are too woven into the fabric of society and become almost untouchable. But still, they are in some way touchable. \n\nIn other forms of government where there is an idea of total equality and \u201chappiness\u201d, the path of non-corruption is razor-thin.. the elites and those in charge of arranging such a system are bombarded with easily obtained power and rules favoring the top for the \u201cgood of the nation\u201d, and usually these things are by little to no opposition at first. Before long there is justification for the elites to live like kings in order to preserve the country, and only when it\u2019s far too late and the elites control most of the economy, the media, the military, and the resources do you realize that you need to rebel. Unfortunately we\u2019ve seen this play out many many times now, and yet people (guided by their kind hearts and believe in good) still think that a society of equality is still achievable. Maybe if freewill is removed, yes, but until then I don\u2019t see it possible. The path to corruption is too great when the government is heavily involved to maintain this equal standard of living. It doesn\u2019t occur naturally, and the dependence on government to establish this norm is what lends itself to government overstep and oppression.",

You are the utopian idealist who believes human nature is some esoteric value that permeates all humans, if this was true and all humans always acted the exact same with regards to greed and individual interest we would not have been communal for the overwhelming majority of our existance. The truth is that \u201cHuman Nature\u201d is entirely defined by adaptation, adaptation to material conditions (That means everything from genetics, socioeconomics, access to resources, education etc etc etc). There is no singular \u201cHuman Nature\u201d and by falling for the classic meme, you have displayed you have absolutely no idea what on earth you are talking about.\n\nAlso again you have fallen for the classic \u201csocialism is about total equality\u201d meme to which i will quote lenins rebute to this hilariously inept and uneducated assertion:\n\n\u201c\n\n\u201cIf we take socialism, not as an economic theory, but as a living ideal,\u201d Mr. Tugan declared, \u201cthen, undoubtedly, it is associated with the ideal of equality, but equality is a concept ... that cannot be deduced from experience and reason.\u201d\n\nThis is the reasoning of a liberal scholar who repeats the incredibly trite and threadbare argument that experience and reason clearly prove that men are not equal, yet socialism bases its ideal on equality. Hence, socialism, if you please, is an absurdity which is contrary to experience and reason, and so forth!\n\nMr. Tugan repeats the old trick of the reactionaries: first to misinterpret socialism by making it out to be an absurdity, and then to triumphantly refute the absurdity! When we say that experience and reason prove that men are not equal, we mean by equality, equality in abilities or similarity in physical strength and mental ability.\n\nIt goes without saying that in this respect men are not equal. No sensible person and no socialist forgets this. But this kind of equality has nothing whatever to do with socialism. If Mr. Tugan is quite unable to think, he is at least able to read; were lie to Lake the well-known work of one of the founders of scientific socialism, Frederick Engels, directed against D\u00fchring, he would find there a special section explaining the absurdity of imagining that economic equality means anything else than the abolition of classes. But when professors set out to refute socialism, one never knows what to wonder at most\u2014their stupidity, their ignorance, or their unscrupulousness.\n\nSince we have Mr. Tugan to deal with, we shall have to start with the rudiments.\nBy political equality Social-Democrats mean equal rights, and by economic equality, as we have already said, they mean the abolition of classes. As for establishing human equality in the sense of equality of strength and abilities (physical and mental), socialists do not even think of such things.\n\nPolitical equality is a demand for equal political rights for all citizens of a country who have reached, a certain age and who do not suffer from either ordinary or liberal-professorial feeble-mindedness. This demand was first advanced, not by the socialists, not by the proletariat, but by the bourgeoisie. The well-known historical experience of all countries of the world proves this, and Mr. Tugan could easily have discovered this had he not called \u201cexperience\u201d to witness solely in order to dupe students and workers, and please the powers that be by \u201cabolishing\u201d socialism.\n\nThe bourgeoisie put forward the demand for equal rights for all citizens in the struggle against medieval, feudal, serf-owner and caste privileges. In Russia, for example, unlike America, Switzerland and other countries, the privileges of the nobility are preserved to this day in all spheres of political life, in elections to the Council of State, in elections to the Duma, in municipal administration, in taxation, and many other things.\n\nEven the most dull-witted and ignorant person can grasp the fact that individual members of the nobility are not equal in physical and mental abilities any more than are people belonging to the \u201ctax-paying\u201d, \u201cbase\u201d, \u2018low-born\u201d or \u201cnon-privileged\u201d peasant class. But in rights all nobles are equal, just as all the peasants are equal in their lack of rights.\n\nDoes our learned liberal Professor Tugan now under stand the difference between equality in the sense of equal rights, and equality in the sense of equal strength and abilities?\u201d\n\n\nFurthermore it is clear that you have no idea what the differences between utopian socialism and scientific socialism are. Read Engels \u201cSocialism: Utopian and Scientific\u201d if you have an actual interest in educating yourself on this topic you so clearly know nothing about.",

Governments should pay unemployment benefits to ensure people survive but that is it.\n\nThe quote then talks about \"exploitation\" and \"oppression\" which have become meaningless rhetoric with how much socialists overuse them. And finishes off by talking about how a system which ends unemployment and poverty is real liberty and capitalism has done that more than any other system as capitalism lifts hundreds of millions of people out of poverty around the world and greatly improved food production and security.\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/rainerzitelmann/2019/07/08/chinas-economic-success-proves-the-power-of-capitalism/?sh=436cbd2b3b9d\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/26/this-is-the-golden-age-eastern-europes-extraordinary-30-year-revival",

[This page](https://www.regjeringen.no/no/statsbudsjett/2021/statsbudsjettet-2021-statens-inntekter-og-utgifter/id2768898/) is in Norwegian but you can see the part in the chart where it says petroleum.\n\nThe reason why the fund is so big is that when they started it, they made a law that said they couldn't use more than 4% of it's value. This was later reduced to 3%. So as long as it grows by more than 3% a year, it will continue to increase in value. I think the average annual growth is around 6%. They also implemented laws/regulations that ensured that natural resources couldn't just be exported and exploited by companies without benefiting the country.",

Then slowly add equal parts of whole milk of your choice, and fish stock. Let it simmer, and add diced fish ( I usually use a mix of cod and salmon but you can use any mild fish ). I season it with dill, salt pepper and parsley. Serve once the fish is cooked through. You can add cream if you like a richer soup. Thats the way I make it but I\u2019m sure there are lots of variations you could try! Serve with crusty bread. Its very warming and filling in the colder months. edit:spelling.",

Easy to access, and medication is cheap as fuck. \n* If you pay tax, the country will take care of you when you can't take care of yourself. \n* Absolutely dogshit weather in the winter.

While at the same time decrying these things as \"socialistic\".\n\nYou can't claim AOC understands what socialism is when she calls universal healthcare \"socialist\". They way she, Bernie Sanders, and a lot of the progressive caucus use those words is not correct. They should be using the correct term social democracy. \n\nI don't understand why you think I'm a troll, but one thing I've noticed is when you engage with people on reddit who think they are \"left\", and criticize or challenge their view from a leftist perspective, I get called a troll, right winger, nazi, etc. \n\nThe reason why I engage in this type of discussion is because words matter. If we just lump everything together into \"democrat\" or \"liberal\", you exclude a giant massive spectrum of post-capitalist thought and theory. \n\nThis is just a tangent now, but thinking that democrats and republicans,  or conservatives and liberals are diametrically opposed is psychotic, and you miss out on good discourse about workers rights and leftist policies.",

You aren't seeing the intermediate picture, you're seeing very short and very long term.\n\nBut the world is still going to need oil & gas atleast for the intermediate future, that's a fact. If Germany needs a million cubic meters of natural gas every day, not only is Germany going to be more dependant on Russia should Norway stop it's production of natural gas. Russia also has different requirements for HSE than Norway. The way to solve this isn't to make Norway or any other oil & gas nation cut their production, because the demand is going to remain the same, and someone is going to eventually fill that void. The way to solve it is to lessen the demand. But given that green activists are some of the dumbest people on the planet, they've managed to make Germany even more dependant on fossil fuels because of their irrational fear of nuclear energy.\n\nIt's very frustrating talking to idealists like you, because you're often the most ignorant.",

Roughly 20% of the population of Sweden was born in another country. \n\nLet that sink in for a second - *every 5th person in Sweden was born somewhere else* - and Sweden has been anything even remotely close to \"picky\" when it comes to who we've let in (unfortunately). Most of the the immigrants we've taken are people fleeing from the wars in the ME that the US started. In 2014, Sweden allowed 110,000 refugees into the country - the US allowed 70,000. Sweden has a population around 10 million, the US has a population of 330 million - you do the math...\n\nAs for pickiness, \"only\" 14% of the US population is foreign born - but the US is *very* picky in who is granted citizenship, the majority of those foreign borns are skilled labour like for example IT/tech workers from India which the US let in because they're expected to be very lucrative for the country. \n\nNorway is at pretty much the same level - 14% of the population are foreign born currently, but again a far bigger share of those are people fleeing from wars and persecution.",

It's an hour you're not getting paid for but also can't really go do whatever you want because you only have an hour before you have to be back at work. So 1 hour commute a day plus 1 hour unpaid lunch is an extra 2 hours a day you aren't paid for but isn't really your time. Ends up being 10 hours a week of lost time you aren't paid for.\n\nAlso in a lot of places 2 hour round trip commute isn't that strange. Tons of metropolitan areas are prohibitively expensive to live in but that's where tons of offices and businesses are located. So you have to live outside the metro areas and commute in. Moving closer isn't an option for many people. And if you get a job closer to where you live, outside the city, it likely isn't going to pay as well.",

The state retains ownership in large (and small) companies important to national interest.\n\nFor Norway and Sweden big enterprises like Sweden's LKAB, Vattenfall, Sveaskog and Norway's Eqinor, Norsk Hydro, Kongsberg gruppen are companies where the state own the majority of shares. \n\nSimilarly alcohol is a state monopoly in both countries and the state further fully or partially own a plethora of companies that provide social or other services of national interest.\n\nNow who are the \"state\"? In Norway we say that these companies and resources are owned and controlled by \"fellesskapet\" wich can loosely be translated to the community, or the fellowship. What Norwegians understand it to mean is owned by \"all of us\".\n\nThe idea of \"fellesskapet\" is central to most if not all Norwegian policy.  Another idea central in Norwegian policy and state practices is that of \"forvaltning\" or stewardship. \nSo the role of the Norwegian state(our elected officials and bureaucracy) is to be the stewards of the resources belonging to all of us.\n\nIs that socialism? \nAbsolutely. \n\nIs objectively the best way to govern a country? 100%\n\nAccording to who?\n28 million of the happiest, healthiest, most socially mobile people to ever live on this planet.",

But the income disparity and the privatization of basic needs of every stable society like education, infrastructure and healthcare is leading to a situation in which wealthy people can live the dream and are better of than anywhere on this world while the middle class and poorer people are usually worse of than in many developed country.\nThe average McDonald\u2019s worker in Germany has 4 weeks of paid vacation, unlimited and paid sick time, free universal healthcare and their children are also insured for free and can study at the country\u2019s best universities for free if they want and have good grades. Child care is free and they are legally obligated to provide it to you (but you need to apply early). \nIf the McDonald\u2019s worker loses their job they will still get money for a while until they find another job. If their income is below a certain threshold they will get assistance so that they  have the minimum amount of money deemed as a livable income. Their apartment will also be paid and they stay fully insured during that time. \nThese are the bare basics in most developed countries and they are working very well to ensure that people don\u2019t have to die or get exploited just because they are too poor or are afraid of losing insurance. \nThe average American has to have quite a good mid to high-level job to have comparable benefits, but even then you are just one accident or chronic illness away from losing your insurance, your job and all your life saving due to high hospital costs.",

So no fucking shit these tiny ass countries whose main source of driving their economy is drilling oil are going to have a better quality of life, there\u2019s barely anyone living there! \n\nOh yeah, let\u2019s not forget that Reddit is constantly advocating getting rid of fossil fuels but will pat Norway on the back for drilling oil and destroying our planet because hey, at least THEIR people are happy! \n\nRant over.

I also singled out Norway using fossil fuels to fuel their economies (no pun intended) and used the other countries to compare population. Which probably wasn\u2019t needed but just wanted to point it out. \n\nAnd yes, more people=more tax revenue, but we pay significantly less taxes than our European friends. We also have over 300 million more people than Norway to attend to and that many more resources our tax money goes to to keep the US moving forward. Have you seen how large the US is? We have a lot of stuff man, and a lot of that stuff is funded by tax payer money. It also doesn\u2019t help that the US wants to spend trillions and trillions on military but sadly there\u2019s nothing I can do about that. \n\nWe could easily be as successful as some European countries\u2026but you know, that military industrial complex tho.",

That they delay important, non-elective procedures by putting you on a waiting list for many months or years? Stuff like that.\n\nWell, that's an ADMITTED LIE cooked up by the insurance industry.  You don't have to take my word for it, here's a quote from 2020 from the former head of corporate communications at Cigna Health Insurance:\n\n> \"Amid America's COVID-19 disaster, I must come clean about a lie I spread as a health insurance exec. We spent big money to push the idea that Canada's single-payer system was awful and the U.S. system much better. It was a lie, and the nation's COVID responses prove it. I'll regret slandering Canada's system for the rest of my life\"\n\n> \"I was becoming concerned, as it was necessary for me to spread this misinformation, and it really began in 2006. And that was sort of when my crisis of conscience began, and it pertained to the premiere of Michael Moore's movie \"Sicko.\" And part of our campaign to push back against that movie was to spread misinformation about Canada or use cherry-picked data and anecdotes. For example, AHIP sent me and my counterparts at other insurance companies a binder just as that movie was premiering with bullet points of things that we should say in our conversations with reporters and others about the Canadian system or the British or French system for that matter but, particularly, the Canadian system. **These really were cherry-picked data points and was not in any way painting an accurate portrayal of the Canadian health care system.**\"\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2020/06/27/884307565/after-pushing-lies-former-cigna-executive-praises-canadas-health-care-system\n\nBack to what you said:\n\n> whilst Scandi often appear high on happiness they also appear high on negative spectrums such as mental health and suicide.\n\nThis is what major think tanks and companies have been pushing because they see the systems in those countries as a threat.  They're doing exactly what they did before; Find ways to cherry pick and demonize a superior system and associate them with terms that are viewed negatively. Those countries aren't even socialist (the workers do not own the means of production and they are capitalist countries) but they keep getting conflated that way, and with other stats like what you listed, because it is what the think tanks believe best protects the status quo in the US that keeps their donors free from higher taxes and regulation.\n\nI'm not saying you believe that, and I think you make a good point that it may not be policy fault.  But there is a large dose of this information getting spread in the guise of news articles and studies and \"facts\" that are being bent to make countries like that appear negative by association.",

It's like comparing the crime rate in NYC with the crime rate in a small town in Nebraska.  Sure, the small town will have less crime, but it also has less of *anything.*\n\nIf you were to make Norway ten times bigger, and add another 3.5 million people of all different races and religions, I guarantee you Norway wouldn't be the poster child that everyone makes it out to be.\n\nIt's all about context",

By taxes, tarrifs, and trade revenues. Norway, in particular, has government investments and holdings that get them profit (looking at their crypto holdings in particular. Isn't their biggest investment, but it exists and that's enough for me to be happy.)\n\nWhat Norway has done, and well, is creating a  buisiness market that pays moderate taxes. It doesn't penalize being rich, it taxes the board equally. \n\nWhat Norway does, that I see be a massive failure in the US, is recognize and balance pro business regulations and taking a cut from that to increase revenues and quality of life. \n\nHistorically, in the US, when we have money issues, we raise taxes, and create a mentality that being rich is bad. In doing so... businesses leave. We get less taxes, because the tax base LEAVES. \n\nNorway approach has been to keep taxes moderately level over time. However, when the gov needs more money, it incentivizes businesses to be in Norway. This has led to a (comparatively) lower tax rate, but bigger tax bracket, as more business means more revenue. \n\nNorway, Sweden, and Denmark have an incredible lesson that's perverted here in the US. A social framework is achievable and possible, but it is built on capitalist grounds. Creating more taxes and anti-business environments doesn't increase taxes... it scares off businesses. And that means no monies.",

I guess I'll continue on with that.  \n\nFirst: when they say massive demographics shifts can we agree they're referring to race and ethnicity?  Age, gender, etc don't really make sense with what they're talking about.  Plus you can't exactly look around and tell who's an immigrant and who's not right?  So what else could they be talking about?  \n\nSecondly: they emphasize that legal immigration is an issue as well but don't have a problem with the former first lady Melania Trump or their boss Rupert Murdoch.  Strange huh?  Wonder why that is...\n\nThirdly: I couldn't find the clip but it's included in one of the videos I linked but Tucker Carlson explicitly talks about \"replacement theory\" in relation to \"demographics shifts.\"  Which like...seriously he just took the great out of Great Replacement Theory which is a white supremacist conspiracy theory. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement\n\nIt's barely a dog whistle.",

Since that's sort of vague there's usually other caveats like they must also have a majority European (aka white) population or at least not have too much influence from indigenous cultures (hence why Latin America isn't usually considered part of Western Civilization but Australia is)  \n\nTwo key features of Western culture are Greek philosophy and Judeo-Christianity.  But for some reason Muslims who helped keep Greek philosophy and science alive and reintroduced it to Europe aren't considered part of Western culture even though sometimes modern Israel is?  Because of the Judeo-Christianity part I suppose?  Notice they didn't say Abrahamic faiths because that would also include Muslims.  Can't be having that!\n\nBasically people like Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham are just trying to find convoluted ways to say that white Christians (and sometimes Jewish people but not the \"cultural Jews\"/\"JINOs\" as Shapiro refers to them) are superior to everyone else and we need to make sure our demographics reflect this.  (Again, going back to the \"even legal immigrants are bad except if they're white then they're ok\" thing.)",

I have been involved in economical processes for about three years and the situation does not seem to improve, the expenditures are higher than the incomes. Long waiting times are one of the biggest issues with the Norwegian health care system, not only for the professionals but also the patients and next of kin who suffer the consequences of having to wait to get their illnesses treated. The lack of money also causes a lot of medical technical equipment to be outdated. Let me just emphasize that this does not apply to critical equipment needed in the intensive care units or emergency care wards \u2013 equipment here is usually state of the art. The old equipment are found in the common hospital wards. We're talking about BiPAP and CPAP machines that date from the late 90s in some hospitals, infusion pumps from the early 90s, beds from the 80s(!), and so forth. Many wards are dated themselves, air quality is mediocre at best, and the rooms are small which is a burden to the staff and patients. Many rooms do not have their own toilets, and in some hospitals up to five patients may share a room. You can not expect a good nights sleep in a room where one patient is delirious, and the other one is snoring, the third one wants to keep the light on.\"\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Norway/comments/44bcv4/people\\_who\\_actually\\_live\\_in\\_norway\\_do\\_you\\_like/",

I\u2019ve also known British people who aren\u2019t white go to Germany and France and some of them come back saying they\u2019ll never go there again because it was so bad.\n\nMate you can\u2019t even spell racism right.

Anyway 'happiness' is not how many people go with a smile through their day or are satisfied with the way they live. Most of the time the public is asked nothing. Rather they often look at things like:\n\n- Racism/Homophobia/Freedom of Religion\n\n- The existence of social safety nets\n\n- Adjusted GDP\n\nI just looked them up and don't know them from the back of my head, but a country with more diversity laws and social safety net will automatically score higher. This means the score gives 'left wing policies' automatically a higher score and countries with more 'freedom', meaning less laws, a lower score.\n\nAmerica is not as bad as you keep saying it is and it's starting to piss me off. You have more expensive healthcare, but you definitely pay less each month than I do; much less. In America salaries are way higher than here in Europe. You have the strongest army in the world.

      "text": "What\u2019s crazy is that the reason these countries work in my opinion is that there are some major differences. \n\n1.\tThere is a United culture that the people share.\n2.\tThey are smaller and have less need for vast infrastructure like roads to traverse long distances\n3.\tTheir defense budgets are super small when compared to the US. \n\nCulture is very important. Look at Japan for example, the people share a culture and all mostly agree on how to behave in society. This runs the gamut from umbrellas you can use and leave around cities (which would be stolen in a place like New York in a minute) to people getting mad at neighbors if you don\u2019t sort trash properly. Contrast that with the United States where we are a melting pot of different cultures that hold different value systems. The only unifying moments we\u2019ve had is when we have a common enemy or are attacked. \n\nInfrastructure is pretty obvious, so I don\u2019t think I need to elaborate, but it\u2019s important to point out that the land mass is much greater than a smaller country and requires upkeep. \n\nThe [defense budget](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/NOR/norway/military-spending-defense-budget) is the big one.\n\nNorway spends about $7B (Billion) dollars on defense per year. The US? Try $731B (this is according to what is reported god knows what the true figure is like black ops kind of money or the money \u201c[lost](https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2007/feb/08/usa.iraq1)\u201d in Iraq. \n\nWe have a massive defense budget because we play \u201cworld police\u201d. Whether that\u2019s a good thing or not, at this point, it\u2019s what we\u2019re stuck with. One thing I thought was actually positive that Trump did was to see that imbalance and ask other countries to chip in. I don\u2019t know how well that went though because I didn\u2019t read up on it, but at least someone said something about it and it got on a radar somewhere. \n\nIf we didn\u2019t have such a huge ass defense budget, we\u2019d have more money to actually make the country better. The US shouldn\u2019t have to be responsible for the vast majority of defense costs to keep world peace. \n\nI\u2019ll mention that I don\u2019t follow politics that close, and I may be way off base on something here, but just from a glance at the defense budget ranges around the world, I\u2019ve always wondered why we shoulder every responsibility, insert our noses in other countries issues, and try to manipulate other countries when we don\u2019t like what they\u2019re doing (see what happened to Gaddafi). \n\nIt would be interesting to get a take on this issue from someone that has studied it and researched it I think. \n\nBut people don\u2019t tend to look at these issues when claiming how awesome countries like Norway are and wondering why the US is a shit show.",

Having said that, it's also a bit of a chicken and egg situation, as those social services can in fact help one get to a position in life in which one does feel a greater satisfaction and sense of accomplishment.  \n\nJust as long as those people who are taking advantage of those services are inclined to truly appreciate them.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that those programs inevitably become political fiscal footballs as the funding they enjoyed at the start starts draining away to pay for other government programs that have been decried by the press and public as being underfunded.   In the end there's only so much taxpayer money to go round, and it's Peter vs. Paul when it comes to budget time.",

Either way it isn't free, and people have been lied into believing that it is.\n\nThe US has a problem with bureaucracy that believes throwing money at something solves problems which is why we have bloated social programs that aren't effective at executing their mission statements leaving trillions wasted. The USPS works at a deficit and works like shit, we spent trillions on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan only for it all to be wasted decades later, the SEC is proven to be complicit with big banks and businesses against retail, and the IRS is now going after people with only $600 in the bank account to generate additional tax revenue because they aren't going after the wealthy.\n\nThis country owes nearly $30-trillion in debt to the banks; $2-trillion budget deficit, and we're spending more like clockwork. I'm not saying we shouldn't solve these issues, but to believe that in the US we're going to solve these other issues by spending the money to open up other branches of government is pure speculation.\n\n\\*Edit: Gotta love how I'm being downvoted, but not counterargued.

Governmental assistance is available for white people as they are for any other people in the US. There are more white people on public assistance than black people. Banks have been discriminating against black americans since we gain our freedom. We've been denied business loans or, if accepted, given much smaller amount compared to white americans. This still goes on even [today](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-modern-day-redlining-20180215-story.html). Certain loans are directed toward minorities to combat that problem, but it still isn't *easy*.  The farm bill to help black farmers were made after DECADES of discriminatory practices toward black farmers. It was by design and cost tons of black people their [farms](https://eji.org/news/one-million-Black-families-have-lost-their-farms/).\n\n\"Starting with New Deal agencies in 1937, federal agencies whose \u201cwhite administrators often ignored or targeted poor Black people\u2014denying them loans and giving sharecropping work to white people\u201d became \u201cthe safety net, price-setter, chief investor, and sole regulator for most of the farm economy in places like the Delta.\u201d As small farms failed, large plantations grew into huge industrial mega-farms with enormous power over agricultural policy.\r  \n\r  \nIllegal pressures applied through USDA loan programs created massive transfers of wealth from Black to white farmers in the period just after the 1950s. Half a million Black-owned farms across the country failed between 1950 and 1975. Black farmers lost about six million acres from 1950 to 1969.\"\n\nBlack americans still lag behind in employment and lack a considerably amount of wealth in comparison to white americans and yet your trying to make it as if the country is oh so harder for white people. Complete and total bull. Truth is you have majority white states who should be, as you claim, much happier without being surrounded by welfare seeking minorities and yet, it is these states that are prime examples of the failure of american society. With so many people turning to drugs to cope with life or ending their life, your \"homogeneous society is a better society\" argument doesnt hold water.",

My argument is not that discrimination didn't or does not exist, just that if you are a broke white person who had nothing to do with racism or segregation, it's probably no comfort to you that there are federal programs that help right wrongs of the past when you might need assistance today. \n\n> and yet your trying to make it as if the country is oh so harder for white people. \n\nActually you were the one who made comments about drug addled and poor white people. \n\n> Truth is you have majority white states who should be, as you claim, much happier without being surrounded by welfare seeking minorities\n\nDoesn't matter at the state level when there are clear federal biases in place.  And non white doesn't immediately mean Black.  There are tens of millions of Hispanics who are at the Lower end of the economic scales because that is what happens when you enter A country with limited skills, language and networks.  It takes generations to build up wealth and 5th and 6the generation farmers of mexican decent are just as wealthy and prosperous as their white counterparts.   \n\n\npoint remains that Norway can operate a generous welfare state when it isn't importing tens of millions of non-Norwegian speaking people to work the lowest jobs and Tax the benefits system.   \nStop frothing for a second and try to understand what is being discussed here.",

But I think you should look at why the Nordics generally are so white. I mean the US has so many black people mostly because they brought hundreds of thousands from Africa as slaves, and the high latin population are because of the souther border. The nordics have nothing like that and have had people for thousands of years so there was never a mass immigration like the US had.\nThere is pretty strict immigration though, integrating people to society is expensive so there is a limit to how many that can be taken in. But you can\u2019t hold the fact that there is a lot of white people against them. And saying they refuse immigrants is wrong. The small populations just mean not as many immigrants can be supported. I am more curious about how many refugees are taken in per capita.",
