Their entire idea of \"standing up to Republicans\" is  tiptoeing up to them, waiting politely for their attention, timidly asking \"Um, please, sir, may we have some civil rights?\", and then turning back to their colleagues and going \"We've tried everything they could possibly do\".\n\nI want Democrats to fight DIRTY. I want them to flood the airwaves with ads that just stop short of accusing their opponents of child molestation. I want Matt Gaetz's opponent to run an ad saying \"Matt Gaetz REPEATEDLY RAPED a 17 year old girl. Will Matt Gaetz target YOUR CHILD next?\". Republicans want to do the whole \"trans people are groomers\" thing? We've got WAY more material to work with than they do. I want to see Democrats get dirty, vulgar, crass, and just tiptoe up to the line of defamatory (though in some cases, it's just telling it like it is). \n\nLike a COVID anti-vaxxer and a Big Lie pusher, I want them to be constantly \"just asking questions\"? Why DID the Tennessee Republicans try to legalize child marriage? Which children specifically are they looking to marry? Republicans want to make abortion illegal even for a minor who is the victim of rape? Why ARE they trying to empower and encourage rapists to target children? Are the child rapists they embolden going to target YOUR CHILD next? Known Trump terrorist supporter Clarence Thomas listed a number of freedoms he wants to destroy. Is he coming for YOUR freedom next? I want these to be the contents of \"moderate\" Democratic ads. Republicans make ads implying that they are literally going to murder their opponents almost daily. I think shining a light on their perpetual child predation and attempt to wipe out American democracy is very reasonable.\n\n\"When they go low, we go high\" is a blueprint on how to let Nazis take over your country. It should be \"When they go low, we stop them into the ground like the maggots they are\".",

They didn't break the law, because they weren't made to give unambiguous testimony, and ambiguity is a get-out-of-perjury free card. Every single Senator on both sides knew that these were anti-abortion activists during their confirmation hearings. None of the Senators were stupid enough to sincerely believe their promises about court precedent, although some may have been stupid enough to assume the chance was unlikely to arise.\n\nIt's been a big stupid joke for more than 30 years now that every SCOTUS nominee goes before Congress, and Senators ask them whether or not they would overturn Roe, and the nominees say \"gosh how inappropriate to ask about a hypothetical situation that will totally never come up\" and Senators cite their lifetime's worth of previous correspondence in which they outlined exactly what they would do given the chance, and the nominees say \"I'm a super duper principled judge and I would only rule on the merits of the case\" and the Senators all say \"okay sounds believable to me.\"\n\nWere the justices lying during their hearings? Depends on how you define a lie, but regardless it's not a useful accusation.\n\nCan you impeach them for lying? No, not even the worst of these statements would rise to a legal standard of perjury.\n\nCan you impeach them without perjury? Sure! Impeachment is a political process and it's the final word in removing justices.\n\nCan you impeach them for being fascist scum who don't deserve a lifetime of unaccountable power? Theoretically, yes! If two thirds of the Senate vote to convict, then it doesn't matter what they are convicted of.\n\nWill a SCOTUS justice ever be removed from the bench by impeachment? No, never, not ever. Forget about this because it may as well not even exist as a legal pathway.\n\nWill it help to pursue impeachment against a corrupt SCOTUS justice? In my opinion, no. It would likely hurt things worse by failing. The oligarchy is real, and this is its face. Institutions will not save us.\n\nWhat will help? This is the answer nobody wants to hear. Look after one another, vote locally, and spend decades painstakingly eroding the base of support that these fascists have. Render the political environment uninhabitable for fascists. In the meantime, it will be constant uncertainty and existential dread, and we all will have to live with that. We have yet to stop falling, so brace yourself for worse to come including civil unrest.",
