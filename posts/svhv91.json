People with disabilities or who are not neurotypical in general get pushed to the fringes to the point that society at large doesn't interact with or hear about them.\n\nSo this doesn't read as a troll to me either but somebody who either is A) mainland Chinese who grew up in that sort of suppressive environment and actually believes it or B) a foreigner who interacted with this sort of mainland rhetoric and actually believed it for whatever reason. The people who grew up in it, that's understandable to an extent. But it was wild hearing the few times other foreigners parroted the same phrase about gays, not in mocking or disbelief but wide-eyed wonder and confidence, because they heard it from a Chinese person.",

The IIHF that governs international hockey dont require they be citizens, just residents (for 2 years), have played professionally in that country and didnt play for another national team for a certain number of years.  \n\nIt's different for Gu bc these players didnt need to renounce their Anerican / Canadian citizenship  to play.  But they're still being called traitors online.  Which I dont really understand bc it's not like they chose to play for China instead of the US (i think Gu may have, but a few years ago not overnight).  \n\nThey didnt (and were never going to) make the US team.  The only time you ever usually see it in hockey is when the host team isnt doesnt have a strong hockey program.  They did the same thing in Korea in 2018.  All of the top country teams are made up of high level players from those countries but the host team (that is automatically allowed to play) wouldn't be able to be even slightly competitive against them if they dont have a strong national program in place.  There was even some concern bc the pro team in china played most of their games outside of china (due to covid) so the residency requirements came into question.  \n\nI personally think its cool to expand the game into new markets and its not like China has a chance to win or that players chose to play there instead of the US / Canada countries.  And its not like its a new thing that hasn't been done.  The creation of the pro team in China (Kunlun Red Star) coincided with China's winning the bid for this Olympics, but that all happened years ago, not overnight & it was pretty clear why they were doing it.  But it expands the sport & hopefully gets more people from that area interested in hockey, so I dont see why people are so upset or hateful towards the players.",

YEAH NOT COMPARABLE AT ALL\n\nYou literally just described whataboutism. You are excusing Chinese atrocities by attacking American actions as though that absolves China of any guilt. \n\nShe's also not Chinese. She was born in the United States, raised in the United States, lived in the United States, initially competed for the United States. I find it a bit hypocritical of people who are justifying her choices by pointing out that a lot of Americans have been hateful towards Asian Americans and discounting their loyalty to the country, then categorize her as not being American. So what if she is a second generation immigrant. \n\nYour attitude towards the differences between the American and Chinese actions is emblematic of the problem that this can cause. China wants to do whatever it can to glorify its system and play off the largest incarceration of an ethnic group since the holocaust as comparable to anything America has done in the last 20 years. It isn't. IT JUST FUCKING ISNT. I'm never gonna change your mind. \n\nBut I will remind you what the OP we are commenting on is. America bad. China worse",

Corroberated by a Iraqi Taxi driver who claimed to be close to Saddam, whom also suddenly got a wad of cash to move out of Iraq and buy a mansion in the US. Absolutely nothing weird about that.... But that is just MY opinion, I wont speak on her behalf on the issue. \n\n>I am also partially annoyed because Asian Americans competing for the United States is a good way for them to help their cause\n\nA few asian American athletes for the US would not agree with you. One of them that won gold got death threats and called slurs for taking first place, rather than a White girl. And also,\n\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-59257006\n\n>The gymnast said she and her friends, all of Asian descent, were waiting for their Uber after a night out when a car passed with people inside shouting ethnic slurs and telling them to \"go back to where they came from\".\n\n>One person sprayed her in the arm with pepper spray before the vehicle sped away, she said.\n\nI mean, I understand her. As a half asian myself. If I had the same power as she had when I was a teen, I wouldnt have been so calm about it as she is.",

LGBT is political dissonance in Chinese society, people will say it's not nearly as bad as it is in America, that people don't get attacked and there isn't as much societal hatred, but that's purely because there isn't a \"need\" for it yet. LGBT communities are repressed, they lack the same rights and any protections from discrimination. They go against China's image, they don't fit into the family model because they likely are not going to have children and you're not allowed to adopt children either. Most people will simply not come out nor advance in society if they're openly LGBT. \n\nConsidering all the factors at play, that the footballer also felt the need to remove her post shortly after making it, should be a clear sign that the power is not in her favor.",

Almost certainly it's going to come down to television or some form of media, which I'll inform you I don't watch any of that stuff. What I do read up on and watch are reporters who report on things happening in China. And these aren't people just bashing China, they were citizens, they learned the language, they praised China in many different ways. You can recognize the good and bad in a country. China is a fine country in my mind, but the CCP is an authoritarian government and the affects of that will obviously result in the marginalization of minorities. It always results in the marginalization of minorities or the outright eradication of them, which we're also seeing in China at the moment. \n\nIt's always the case with people like you though. You get called out on your BS and it's immediately \"you've read too much propaganda!\". It's obviously just you projecting since you're currently kissing the CCP's ass with nothing to back it up.",

Obviously there are no Gay people in China, just like there is no Muslims right?\n\nNot saying the joke is good or funny... but let's be real you have to be new to the internet to consider this a legitmate take.  \nAlso it's reddit 99% of us here are making shit up, lying, faking, joking. We dont know eachother we just write dumb shit and move on :D",

Ever. Not a teacher, or a friend's parent (except second hand, as in \"My mom said I can't sleep over at your house because you're ungodly\") It was something you only spoke of as a pejorative. *Good people* who wouldn't call someone a f@g in public just never spoke of the gays... It wasn't spoken of. \n\nCan I say how freakin much I love the fact that we have queer characters on kids TV now?? Lil me in the 80s and 90s would've loved that so much! It's not just queer people who need to see queer representation on TV- their kids and their parents and their friends and their siblings, they all need to see it too.",

It has grown at an astronomical rate in a very short period of time. There really hasn't been a time for these rights to be looked at nor is there a way for these people to really speak out and organize in China. China isn't struggling with LGBT rights like the U.S. did because there simply isn't any real way for LGBT people to put their voice out there and make change so it's going to happen incredibly slowly. Homosexual couples are still not allowed to adopt or marry, there are also no protections from discrimination. \n\nI'll bet my life savings that this doesn't change for a long time, the LGBT community is a repressed community with very little public support or governmental foundations that can be used to defend them. They'll wallow in obscurity because they do not fit into the family model nor cultural values that the CCP is pushing for. \n\nWhat you are describing is a negative peace, there is no conflict so there will be no resolve to this problem. It's not a good thing. Though I do agree it's far better than China eradicating another minority group, they totally wouldn't do that.",
