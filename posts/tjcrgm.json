After a particularly long week of school/homework/working from 4-11:30pm every day that week it was finally Friday and I had a free weekend. \n\nThrew my backpack in the car, and realized I\u2019d actually lost my lanyard with my keys so I grabbed the set out of my backpack thanking my forward thinking self and cranked the car and started home.\n\nGoing home, I was getting more people checking out the car than usual. It was kind of nice and was putting the biggest smile on my tired face. Lots of pointing and waving from passers by.\n\nI got home and realized my keys with the lanyard were still in the drivers door and were flapping around all the way home and that\u2019s why people were waving.",

Realizing I can't look clearly with the clip-ons over my glasses, I reach up to take them off... and realize they were never on top of my head, never fell off and never got lost.

I've always been a sound sleeper, never sleepwalker or talked etc just put my head down and wake in the morning.\nI can still remember the feeling now of thinking I was holding my lifeless child.

One worked security at a local lumber mill at night, so she had lots of time to work on schoolwork so long as she did her patrols as needed. She also worked an on-campus job for 20 hrs/week. Another friend spent early mornings (like 3am - 9am) loading trucks for delivery, then would be in classes from 11am - 5pm and worked an on-campus job between classes. Both worked around 50 hrs/week. Throw in a weekends-only job and you can push 70 while in school. The friend that had the lumbermill security job did much better in her schooling than the one that loaded trucks because of the \"free\" time that job had. Both had pretty involved majors (pre-med and computer programming).",

I called the place my wife wanted (of course) but they didn't have any drivers at the time for deliver.  I just said I'd just swing by and pick it up, no problem.  \n\nI wait until it's time to leave, hop in my SUV--it's fall so it's dark early--buckle up, put it in reverse, check the mirrors (wow, it's dark), check the backup camera (also dark), and then hit the gas to reverse.  **Bam** right into my closed garage door.  \n\nI pulled forward, but had hit it with enough force that it was bowed out and we were completely stuck inside.  I called a bud to pick the food up for us, because we had already paid for it, and then had to get someone the next day to pry up the garage door and get things replaced.  It was about a $3k mistake, but thankfully no one was hurt.\n\nDon't drive sleepy, folks.",

Well I wanted to go outside at like 2 am so I grabbed a chair, went to the closet which had milk crates full of books, dumped books out and then stacked them on top of the chair. I unlocked the door and disappeared, and of course my mom was frantic. Luckily as she woke up and realized I wasn't in the house she got a knock on the door and some guy that lived either down the street or a street away had my hand in his and just dead pan went \"is this yours?\" My mom cried, dhs visited but realized I was just.....a hellion and my mom was doing her best and was dead ass asleep. I was like 4 or 5, and God the antics I got up to were ridiculous. \n\nShe found me asleep with a jar of peanut butter and a wrench I used as a spoon to eat it with cradled in my arms. \n\nGot my foot stuck in a peanut butter jar (weird how much kids like peanut butter) and did that because I \"wanted to know what it felt like\" I think it was brand new too. \n\nAnother time while she was sleeping I got up and started grabbing the eggs from the fridge, put them under the couch cushions and jumped, freaked out when I saw what a mess I'd made and took off my dress to try and clean it up and just shuffled the cushions around with the egg side down. Yeah she wasn't amused at that one. \n\nShe woke up to me, in the floor, having ate an entire cheesecake by myself and there were little cheesecake footprints everywhere. I was also pretty much naked and it was all over me. \n\nAnd the cutest was waking up to me in the sink, playing I think, and I had seen my mom use water for her coffee so I filled up a cup with hot water and proudly told her I made coffee. \n\nMan I was a tough kid to deal with and smart and now here we are......dumb and lazy and just did not live up to my potential at all. I felt so bad for my mom as I grew up and realized I didn't want kids and how much of a little shit I was",

We were both back to work, I am a server, and he was a chef at the time, on opposite schedules, with two other kids on top of it all.   \n\n\n\n\n\nAt one point, I hadn't slept for almost four days between the twins not sleeping, my two older kids, and closing shifts. One night I fed the same twin twice, changed the other one twice, and started to hallucinate. I had to wake up my husband because it was past the danger line.    \n\n\n\n\nSleep deprivation is no joke; it's serious; I wish more parents could have a support system in place to help out. It really does take a village, especially when they are newborns, especially with multiples. Hell, even as kids get older, it's nice to have the extra help and guidance, if anything, for a little bit of respite for you AND your kid(s).    \n\n\n\n\nIdk how my husband and I pulled through; our 7 yr old had severe special needs at the time as well. A support system would have been such a blessing for us back then. It would have been a blessing for us as our oldest daughter got worse through the years and the twins got older; 2-year-old twins are... fun, lol. Our little family is super chill now, but man, that was a ROUGH 8 years.",

The \"no\" and the \"why?\" phases are rough, but it's cool watching their curiosity, to see them learning the world around them. Seeing them grow, their personalities developing from \"the twins\" to their own individually, is amazing. \n\n\n\n\nMy twins are almost 11 now, and they are incredible kids! We hang out, game, watch true crime and hoarders, go shopping, and do fun stuff. It's a great age; they still want to hang out with you, and there's no pre-teen attitude or drama yet, lol. It's also a nice age where you can sit down and have honest adult-type conversations with them.    \n\n\n\n\nMy oldest daughter is 16 now; she's about to start driving. She will be a Junior in Sept and start looking at colleges. My oldest is 20 this year, in his 2nd year in culinary school. He has already left the nest and moved in with his HS sweetheart. It flew by with all of my kiddos; I miss them being small, but I couldn't keep them little forever.\n\n\n\n\nParenting is a rollercoaster of holy shit this sucks, and omg, this is amazing; let's have another! Lol. I can't tell you what will suck for you, but I can say that they grow up in the blink of an eye. Before you know it, they're off spreading their wings and leaving you behind. In the meantime, give them lots of hugs, love, time, and enjoy the ride.     \n\n\n\n\nI wish you all the luck with your twins!",

Nothing prepares you for going into labor at 27 weeks and delivering. Nothing prepares you for the trauma of the NICU. Then she brought him home and took care of a preemie alone??? She's a strong woman! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NICU alone is enough to give you PTSD, which many NICU parents have. It's traumatic to see your baby hooked up to all that [equipment](https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/common-nicu-equipment.aspx)  ; every wire, tube, and machine imaginable while being in a box (incubator) where you can't touch them. Some parents can't even see their children for days, let alone hold them.     \n\n\n\n\n\nThen you have to leave the hospital without your child, that you carried all that time and don't know what is happening at the hospital. Sure, you can call whenever, but you are still missing out on all those crucial bonding moments when you aren't there visiting.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo touch on the high maintenance part. I've noticed that most NICU babies tend to be high maintenance. They are used to sleeping a certain way in their incubators (on their tummy, butt up), not being fussed with, on a strict schedule, in a very quiet area, and they aren't fully developed. That's hard for any parent to maintain once they are home, impossible actually. They don't assist with an easy transition either, which doesn't help; parents also have no support after taking the baby home. I'm glad your daughter and her son had that support system; it truly makes a difference.     \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope your daughter and grandson are doing well! \n(Sorry for the rant)",

Dr. Colen first analyzed her data as if it were from a typical observational study, comparing siblings across families. She found the usual result: Children who had been breastfed appeared to have significantly lower rates of obesity, asthma, and hyperactivity, and higher parental attachment, behavioral compliance, vocabulary, reading recognition, math ability, intelligence, and scholastic competence.\n\n> But then, she reanalyzed the same data, this time comparing siblings within families, thereby eliminating confounding by social and economic factors. And Voil\u00e0. She no longer found any apparent benefits of having been breastfed. In fact, the one remaining statistically significant effect was a higher risk of asthma among children who had been breastfed. \n\nBut of course, there's other studies listed in that article. Regardless, the summary of the article is that the data for benefits of breastfeeding is *vastly* overstated. IMO the benefits of parents in a better mental state, and parents sharing the load, outweigh what minor benefits there may be to breastfeeding.",

I stopped at Walmart to get some baby stuff then came out and my truck was gone from the parking lot. I tried the clicker and nothing, it was gone, stolen. I was panicking all around knowing exactly where I had parked but now there was someone\u2019s car, not my truck. After what felt like forever, but really just a few minutes I realized I had driven my wife\u2019s car, not my truck, and in fact her car was in my parking spot. I looked around as I got in and saw a few people laughing who had apparently been watching me. \n\nIn my defense I have both my wife\u2019s and my vehicle keys on my key set so it wasn\u2019t obvious from the keys I had taken a different vehicle.",

I woke up and noticed it was much darker in the room then what it was. That\u2019s when the fear that we both fell asleep, set in. I freaked, sat up and almost yelled: \u201cthe baby!!\u201d My wife patted my arm and said \u201ccalm down, he\u2019s fine.\u201d \n\nThe second time was when he was 2. We lived in a really nice apartment complex that had a really cool playground. My son and I would go over there every weekend and just run around. One night I had a very realistic dream that I had left my son alone at the playground and that he was crying and looking for daddy. I bolted out of bed and ran into his room so quickly that I startled my wife awake. I didn\u2019t even check his monitor, I just yelled something along the lines of \u201che\u2019s still outside!\u201d He was of course asleep in his crib.",

I was just talking to the baby soothingly and gently patting their tummy to get them to fall back asleep. I dozed off, and my wife came in and found us both asleep, and lay the baby back in the sleeper bassinet. She then lay down to get some sleep too. Five minutes later I jolt back to wakefulness and realize the baby isn't under my hand anymore and start feeling around the blankets frantically searching for them, sleepily imagining they have gotten wrapped up in sheets or rolled off the bed. Freaked my wife out bad and woke her up. She still teases me about it now years later.",

My wife ran to the store now that I was home, and I was just exhausted (naturally). And I kinda zoned out, and fell asleep while still being awake, you know like the super deep day dream type things. But I had snapped out of it, and saw one kid on the floor but was half panicking on where the other was. But I still had enough sense to not get up because someone was on my lap lol it set in after a good 15 seconds",
