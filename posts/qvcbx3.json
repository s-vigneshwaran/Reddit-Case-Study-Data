Rosenbaum only attacked him because Kyle was putting out the fire they started. Also, we know that at least three of the rioters that night had firearms. Gaige had one, illegally. The first shooter who fired before Kyle did had one. And the third shooter, who fired after Kyle did had one. Seems to me like a classic example of Game Theory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Protests are very very high tension situations, and although there are plenty of responsible gun owners, there are plenty of dumb ones too and all it takes it one dumbass to freak out and shoot someone..like kyle\n\nThe entire point of the second amendment is to protect one's life which is how it was used. It's not Kyle's fault an insane pedophile screaming the N word and saying he wanted to eat peoples' hearts decided to assault him. Your chance of being raped increases exponentially when you go to the bar, does that mean bar patrons aren't allowed to defend themselves from rapists either?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don\u2019t expect a 17 year old to make the best decisions in that situation which is why they shouldn\u2019t even be in that situation with a firearm\n\nThe gun possession charges were waived.",

He was legally allowed to be there, they even waived his curfew charge. He was putting out a fire with a fire extinguisher when he was assaulted by Rosenbaum. Gaige testified that Kyle only opened fire when Gaige pointed his gun at him. The whole idiotic spin MSNBC is going with now is that Kyle shot Rosenbaum in the back as he was trying to run. Go watch the video, Kyle shot 4 times in 0.75 seconds. He shot him in the chest/shoulder area which caused him to spin around on the 4th shot. Nobody on the planet is able to make conscious decisions within the time span of 0.75 seconds, especially in those conditions. All the talking points about Kyle are crumbling. The only thing people have left is that video where Kyle is bragging to his friends about wanting to shoot two people who were brazenly robbing a store right in front of him a couple weeks earlier. However, if you want to submit that as evidence then you have to take into account that everyone who assaulted Kyle had much worse histories of violence. That's the reason it wasn't admitted as evidence and why the judge got upset when the prosecutor broke the rules and tried to bring it up. It's called propensity character evidence and it doesn't apply because it was agreed upon beforehand that the events of that night weren't initiated by Kyle based on the videos.",

I do agree we can work on the law but that's what it is. You shouldn't try to attack someone with an assault rifle if they aren't actively threatening anyone with it. Getting hit in the head with a skateboard and having a gun pointed at you justifies your defending yourself. Unfortunately, I feel like that's what Rittenhouse wanted. I don't agree with his actions to subtlety invite and incite the violence towards him but the law is what it is. Because he's a douchebag idiot fuck twat, two people died. He can go fuck himself but we have laws like this in place for a reason and the ones enforcing it need to abide by it. It's on the prosecution to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt and the prosecution failed immensely in this case to do so.",
