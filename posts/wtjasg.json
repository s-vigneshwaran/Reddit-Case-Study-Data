What actually happens is they 'settle' DOWN for what they perceive to be 'less than they deserve'. This then breeds resentment and toxicity and you're doomed (yourself, the relationships, everything). You entered into a bad deal under the wrong assumption (she genuinely loves you and you are her prince charming). Women don't take compromise or reality well... and I don't blame them. Imagine being told by disney, educational institutions, wider society, television, etc.. that you are perfect and deserve the dream man/life and then not getting that... you will hate the world (read: men) and especially the man that you 'settled with'. \n\nP.s. I will never forget this one day where I was still working in construction.. we were at a clients house and the couple were there.. the woman (wife) was RUNNING all over the limp wristed simp/beta husband. She was a lawyer, he was a share/stock dude but very rich regardless. They had a kid, lovely house, great career, etc. EVERY SINGLE TIME we saw them on site.. she wore the pants... she got her way over him.. she berated that dude in front of all of us and he just took it and chased after her trying to appease her. Sad... just sad... the lunch time talk was always about how sad and weird that dude seemed and how she's damn near a man and doesn't have anyyyyyyy respect for the dude. \n\nTLDR: Women will settle out of loneliness, but take that 'truth' to the grave or cheat on the side or just be generally toxic and hate your guts for it. It makes sense, they are social creatures (more so) and there is a big benefit in having someone provide something (money, family, lifestyle, etc) even if they aren't 'the one' or the complete perfect thing etc. BUT THEY WILL KNOW THIS AND HOLD SOME SORT OF FEELING ABOUT IT, most likely hatred or a lack of respect about you (who she settled with) because she didn't receive the dream that all girls are sold from very little.",

We die years earlier than y\u2019all while also worker years longer and the whole time working harder. When you said rights taken away are you talking about abortions? So body autonomy? The same thing men have never had in this country? You know how we are born and get circumcised against are will? You do realize that every man that has had that done to him has been introduced to extreme pain at an extremely young age against their will right? If I remember correctly it wasn\u2019t even until 1999 that they started recommending pain relief during the procedure....recommending not requiring. And let\u2019s not get started on selective service which men still face consequences for if they don\u2019t sign up. Plenty of men get fucked over every year because they don\u2019t promise their government the use of their body. If men aren\u2019t oppressed then women definitely aren\u2019t in the west.",

But men only have a fraction of the amount that women do and a lot are for specific races or you have to join a fraternity which would eliminate most men automatically. The highest I could find for men granted 15K. Men actually get the same amount as trans people....and they are less than one percent of the population(2% if you take a few studies). So a little under half of the population gets the same amount as less than 1% of the population. Women have far more and I found one where women can get 150K. Theres also a bunch more that are more than the highest for men(40K 80K). This is despite women making up 59.5% of college students in 2021. The government also affords tax incentives to those who conduct business with women ran businesses. Tax liabilities are reduced for projects funded with fed or state grants/loans when the supplier is a woman owned business. There was a senate bill in April of last year introduced to give a tax credit equal to 25% of W2 wages reported to be claimed annually. That\u2019s up to $10,000 in a tax year with a limit of $40,000 lifetime, specifically for women owned businesses.",
