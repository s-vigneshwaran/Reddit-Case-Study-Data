[The CDC even acknowledges these historical factors have an impact](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/vaccine-equity.html) and, until recently, communities of color (with the exception of Asian-Americans) were vaccinating at lower rates than white Americans. \n\n>\tNo it's stupid, first of all, I don't think there's evidence that African Americans make up a sizeable proportion of unvaccinated people in the US, and if they do, I doubt it's because of skepticism, but because of a lack of access. The vaccines are offered and taken by everyone, black, white, blue, green, this isn't a reasonable circumstance to be skeptical based on racist medical experimentation\n\nSpoken like someone who hasn\u2019t had to experience something like that before. Whatever you think is irrelevant to the reality. If the government in the past has essentially treated you like a second class citizen based on circumstances beyond your control, why would you blindly trust what they ask you to do?\n\nThankfully, vaccination rates are normalizing as alluded to above but there have been discrepancies in the past and, while lack of access certainly is a factor, it is understandable and absolutely reasonable that people within these communities would be skeptical. Efforts need to be made in these cases to help remove such skepticism.\n\nLet me be clear: I\u2019m not saying they (or anyone) are right to be anti-vax, nor that there aren\u2019t people who are anti-vax without having to deal with these things or simply for the sake of being contrarian or malicious. It\u2019s not a good thing for this ideology to persist and it helps no one. It\u2019s also clear that the propaganda is coming from the right-wing and that they continue to amplify it. It\u2019s good that people of all colors and creeds are getting vaccinated at essentially equal rates now. My ultimate point is that not everyone that has an anti-vax attitude is a terrible human being and, for us as a country to change attitudes, as many people as possible that are holdouts need to be deprogrammed.",
