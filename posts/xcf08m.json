  "text": "TIL the writers of the bible never met Jesus when he was alive.\n**Last update 2022-09-15\\*** Thanks for the awards and to everyone that participated in this thread. It made to the front page of Reddit!. I've learned so much over the last couple of days and wanted to share some of it. Here is the original post with some links below.\n\n**Original Post**How has this not come up in every religious debate? I'm just finding out about this out now?\n\nI was under the impression that all the gospels were written by Jesus's disciples. You know the Guys he grabbed from the fishing docks and made them fishers of men.\n\nWitnessed Jesus:\n\n* Perform miracles\n* Perform the sermon on the mount\n* Eat during the last supper\n* Die on the cross\n* Come back from the dead and hang out for 40 days\n\nBut instead I find out:\n\n* Writers of bible never met Jesus when he was alive.\n* It was written ~~60-100~~ **25-80** years after Jesus died.\n* No eyewitness accounts in the bible\n* First writings recorded 25 years after Jesus was crucified.\n\nHow is this not in the opening statement during every theology debate?\n\n**New Info**\n\nI continue to update my understanding but these video's blew me away. Sets up visuals that really illustrate the who what and when regarding the authors of the New Testament. (it's very comprehensive)\n\nIt's been pointed out to me that the authors didn't meet Jesus but they could have walked the earth the same time as Jesus alive, I will concede this point.\n\n[Episode 5 Who wrote the bible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6PrrnhAKFQ&list=PLY24TzULtd7Rs1oEXQyDrqNV2PG7Y5Rpz&index=5)\n\n[Episode 6 Who wrote the bible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UMlUmlmMlo&list=PLY24TzULtd7Rs1oEXQyDrqNV2PG7Y5Rpz&index=6)\n\n&#x200B;",

          "text": "The question which led me away from Christianity, which I would earnestly ask people was \"Does God talk to you?\". \n\nThe gospels were written many years after Jesus's death, and I was told that God spoke to the men who wrote them and basically word for word told them what to write. \n\nThe elders in my church would also share how \"the Lord told me...\". But after many years of earnest listening, I finally had to admit that God didn't tell me jack shit. \n\nSo I'd ask people if God talked to them, and every person would give a different answer. Most people didn't hear \"voices\" but would interpret events in their lives as God speaking to them. But that just felt like tea reading or something. I realized that if God talked to Moses so clearly as to give him the 10 commandments, he could speak to me, but just wasn't. Either that or the whole thing was a farce. This one question was the rot that started the entire decay of my faith. \n\nAnd I still can't get a straight answer out of Christians when I ask \"Does God talk to you?\"",

I\u2019m not religious so I don\u2019t believe there is a god, however, if there is\u2026\n\nThen why do all these bad things happen? Why is there war and famine? Why is there suffering and death? Why are there rapists and serial killers? Why is there disease? We\u2019re told that god loves us, we\u2019re told that he\u2019s all knowing and all powerful. Yet all these bad things exist.\n\nHow could someone who knows everything there is to know and is able to do anything at all, who created everything and the rules that everything is governed by, who loves us, and yet won\u2019t use this knowledge or power to remove the pain and suffering? People like to claim oh evil is needed because otherwise there would be no free will. But if god were truly all powerful and all knowing, surely he could come up with a world where free will exists without evil. If he can\u2019t, he\u2019s not all powerful, now is he? Besides, I\u2019m definitely not all knowing and I\u2019m definitely not all powerful but I\u2019m able to conceptualise worlds where no evil exists.\n\nSo we have to agree that evil and suffering exist because god wants them to exist. Hey he apparently loves us? So why? \n\nWell! I believe I have an answer.\n\nBecause it\u2019s entertaining! Think about your favourite books, tv shows, soap operas and movies: conflict, pain, hardship, suffering \u2014 it makes for great entertainment! God is an author of an inter-dimensional TV show and bad things happen because they make the ratings go up.\n\nGod loves us, but he does so in the way an author loves their characters. God loves us the same way that George RR Marten loved the Starks as he wrote the red wedding scene.\n\nIt makes good entertainment.",

Inspired is not dictated. The writers, as all humans are wont to do, still unavoidably include their perspectives, understandings and interpretations to what they write. And that's okay.\n\nLanguage need not be perfect or precise to be effective. God does not require perfectly scripted text to get his message across.\n\nlet's do a thought experiment, imagine a dark-age monk somehow magically gets a glimpse of today's modern world of cars, planes, computers, cell-phones. He won't even have the vocab or mindset to describe what he has seen. He will do his best comparing it to everyday objects of his time. That's his perspective and interpretation. but his description will still be way off. But the purpose of the message might still well be evident. that's what divinely inspired, humanly written is.",

It is the basis of their morality, the source of their fortitude, the inspiration for their aspirations. For those people it serves a practical, useful and tangible purpose. That it doesn't for you, does not make it useless.\n\n>The only argument i've heard for your religion is the objective morality that comes from the Bible.If this isn't the case i'm interested in were you think morals come from.\n\nMorals for me are just principles that lets us live harmoniously and productively in a communal space given that people have different backgrounds, experiences, personalities etc. That the biblical principles also inform some of those is a useful but not necessary benefit.",

                              "text": "Well I can only speak from an Islamic perspective, and I'm thankful for your civil curiosity, we may disagree on everything but a nice dialogue is appreciated.\n\nSo as we Muslims believe in a creator, we believe an attribute of Allah is that he creates beings. There are 99 names / attributes of Allah. One of those names is Al Khaliq (The creator) so Allah creates different creatures and we believe only Allah knows best in his full wisdom why we are created and he says in the Qur'an that he created jinns and mankind for the purpose of worshipping him alone and through that worship, we get rewarded. Now Allah also does not need our worship, if none of us worship, it does not affect the creator but because of his attributes of being the most kind and most merciful, most forgiving, he creates us and wants us to succeed so that we may earn his mercy on the day of judgement and earn rewards beyond our wildest dreams.\n\nAllah has created many things, such as Angels which worship and serve him, not because he needs any of it, but because Allah enjoys the presence of his creations... but the Angels are bound to his obediance different from mankind...\n\nMankind according to the Qur'an is favored among many of his creations because our minds are not forced to worship or believe in him. The test of this wordly life for us stems from our free minds and free choice. A creation which chooses from free will to worship the creator is above a creation which has no free will between belief or disbelief. \n\nSuffering is part of this test which is a test because it has a beginning and end. \n\n\"How can you deny Allah? You were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, and then to Him you will \u02f9all\u02fa be returned.\" - Al Baqarah 28.\n\nSo we know that life on earth is full of happiness but also pain and suffering. But this suffering is temporary however, and Allah tests his worshippers with calamities and suffering. Will you in your free will, only worship the one creator when your life is all well and turn away from him during trials and tribulations? Or will you worship him despite the circumstances, this all belongs to the test.\n\nWe know in Islam that Allah is all knowing, so he already knows our fate before we are created, but it would be unfair to punish us without having let us go through the human experience which we do so that Allah can show us our deeds and intentions that landed us where we will stand in the hereafter, then we will know that our intentions either misguided us or guided us on the correct path.\n\nSo Allah tells us he created the test for mankind. As for evils, corruption and suffering of the worldly life... these are all byproducts of our free will wandering about our lives. If mankind only had the capacity to do good and no evil... then what is the criteria we are to be tested on in this trial period? The weight of good is only elevated through the capacity and existing option of evil. When all is good, good is normal, default. When good and evil coexists, good is exceptional.\n\nI'm hoping I didn't bore you to death with my long post, but if you still want to talk more and dwell more into questions, I would be happy to talk more to you.\n\nOh and, goodnight to you!",

                                  "text": "> Well I can only speak from an Islamic perspective, and I'm thankful for your civil curiosity, we may disagree on everything but a nice dialogue is appreciated.\n\nI will preface my entire response with an asterisk: I have limited knowledge of Islam. I have not read the Quran, nor have I actively studied Islam, though I have seen a few debates about it.\n\n> <snip> Allah knows best in his full wisdom why we are created and he says in the Qur'an that he created jinns and mankind for the purpose of worshipping him alone and through that worship, we get rewarded. Now Allah also does not need our worship, if none of us worship, it does not affect the creator but because of his attributes of being the most kind and most merciful, most forgiving, he creates us and wants us to succeed so that we may earn his mercy on the day of judgement and earn rewards beyond our wildest dreams.\n\n\"Allah created mankind for the purpose of worshipping him\".  Allah created me too, yet I don't worship him, does that mean I'm broken, or that Allah didn't make me properly?  Either way that would indicate that Allah is not all powerful or else he would have created me in such a way that I would worship him.\n\nIf Allah doesn't need our worship, why did he create us for the purpose of worshipping him?  That doesn't make much sense to me at all, a being who doesn't need our worship wouldn't create us for the purpose of worshipping.  That's a rather large logical contradiction.\n\nYou say that Allah is the \"most forgiving\", but that contradicts completely the following (emphasis mine):\n\n\"They wish that you should reject faith as they reject faith, and then you would be equal; therefore take not to yourselves friends of them, until they emigrate in the way of God; then, **if they turn their backs, take them, and slay them wherever you find them**; take not to yourselves any one of them as friend or helper\"\n\nIf someone turns their back on Islam, they are to be killed (at worst) and shunned and ignored (at best), neither of these are forgiveness.\n\n> Allah has created many things, such as Angels which worship and serve him, not because he needs any of it, but because Allah enjoys the presence of his creations... but the Angels are bound to his obediance different from mankind...\n\nTo me, this points to Allah's character as a deity who just wants toys to play with; \"Allah doesn't need it but wants to enjoy (the presence of) his creations\". \n\n> Mankind according to the Qur'an is favored among many of his creations because our minds are not forced to worship or believe in him. The test of this wordly life for us stems from our free minds and free choice. A creation which chooses from free will to worship the creator is above a creation which has no free will between belief or disbelief.\n\nFree minds and free choice are illusions.  Free will does not exist.  \n\n> Suffering is part of this test which is a test because it has a beginning and end.\n\nThat's an immoral thing to add to a test. I don't recall suffering being included in any of my tests from school.  Your point where the test is a test because it has a beginning and end is nonsensical.  Using that logic any song, book, poem, movie, or TV show are tests because they have a beginning and an end.  \n\nThe fact that this life is finite does not make it a test.\n\n> \"How can you deny Allah? You were lifeless and He gave you life, then He will cause you to die and again bring you to life, and then to Him you will \u02f9all\u02fa be returned.\" - Al Baqarah 28.\n\nNobody but my parents doing the deed caused me to enter this world. I was created by my parents, not by any higher power.  This is a fact of biology; we've literally seen it happen at a cellular level.  To play along though, that passage says that Allah created me (for the purposes of worshipping him - from earlier in your post) to take a test (life), then he will kill me (\"He will cause me to die\"), only to bring me back to life again. Only then will we be \"returned\", which is something that Allah himself imposed.  If Allah is all powerful, could he not have created us in a way that a test was not required, and we were all already \"returned\"?\n\n> So we know that life on earth is full of happiness but also pain and suffering. But this suffering is temporary however, and Allah tests his worshippers with calamities and suffering. Will you in your free will, only worship the one creator when your life is all well and turn away from him during trials and tribulations? Or will you worship him despite the circumstances, this all belongs to the test.\n\nAgain, this is a test that was imposed by an all knowing all powerful all kind all everything being just to play with this.  That *does not* describe a good being.  For Allah to create us with brains that do not believe in him, only for him to punish us because of that.  How is that fair?  Don't say free will, I've already stated free will is illusionary.\n\nA fair and just being would not subject their creations to pain and suffering for the sole purpose of \"cleansing them\" or \"testing them\" or for any reason. It's horrible and barbaric, and any being that does this cannot in any logical way be called \"good\" or \"forgiving\".  That's something that someone experiencing abuse would say about their abuser.\n\n\"Only worship the one creator\"  How do you know Allah is the only creator?  How do you know Allah even *is* the creator?  Why are you so correct about Allah, yet the Christians are so wrong about the exact same God?  How about the jews?  What about Zeus or the rest of the ancient gods?  How do we know that Allah is the creator and not Ahura Mazda (of Zoroastrianism, which predates Judaism (and by extension Allah) by over two thousand years)\n\n> We know in Islam that Allah is all knowing, so he already knows our fate before we are created\n\nJust so you know, \"so he already knows our fate....\" is the elimination of free will.  Allah created us with this fate, he couldn't not have.  Allah cannot create a human who does things Allah didn't know about, therefore you cannot fall back on \"free will\" as a scapegoat.  Allah created us knowing everything we will end up doing, then he's going to punish us for these acts, despite him being the creator of those acts.\n\nIf he knows we're not going to believe and are not going to worship him (which is why he's creating us, isn't it?) that means Allah is not all powerful, an all-powerful being would be able to create me and give me the life he wants.\n\n> but it would be unfair to punish us without having let us go through the human experience which we do so that Allah can show us our deeds and intentions that landed us where we will stand in the hereafter, then we will know that our intentions either misguided us or guided us on the correct path.\n\n\"our deeds and intentions\", no they are Allah's deeds and intentions. Allah created us with the brain that did those deeds and intentions, and he created us knowing that the being he is about to create will perform those deeds and intentions.  This is not an example of free will.  Nor is it an example of \"justness\" or \"fairness\".\n\nAllah is knowingly creating humans that he knows he is going to have to punish.  Why does he have to punish them? Due to the fact that he created the rules we're supposed to follow and created a person that was not up to his own very high standards. In no way is this fair, or just, or any other positive attribute.\n\n\n> So Allah tells us he created the test for mankind. As for evils, corruption and suffering of the worldly life... \n\nAllah **chose to** create a world he knew would be filled will evils beyond description, rapes, murders, genocides, etc.  Allah the all powerful being with the ability to create anything and do everything created this world this way.  If Allah is all powerful Allah could have created a world without but chose not to, Allah chose to cause (or allow) suffering on his own creations. That is not a good example of a being who is \"all loving\" and \"all forgiving\", now is it?\n\n> these are all byproducts of our free will wandering about our lives. \n\nFree will does not exist.  Please do a bit of research on this, I understand that it's the underpinning of your entire belief system, and without the concept of free will, an \"all good, all just, all forgiving\" creator is logically impossible given the world we live in.  No perfectly good being would create a world were unneeded suffering exists, this is antithetical to the concept of \"goodness\".\n\n> If mankind only had the capacity to do good and no evil... then what is the criteria we are to be tested on in this trial period? \n\nAllah is the one who says this is a trial period.  This isn't a trial period, this is just life, the only one you get.  After this is just simply non existence.  I can describe how it feels to you.  It feels the exact same as it did before you were conceived.\n\n> The weight of good is only elevated through the capacity and existing option of evil. When all is good, good is normal, default. When good and evil coexists, good is exceptional.\n\nThis is not true at all, but this is also not a discussion of morality.  Not everything is binary, black/white, good/evil, there's levels of each.  One good deed can *absolutely* be compared to a different good deed. Evil isn't required for that comparison.\n\n> I'm hoping I didn't bore you to death with my long post, but if you still want to talk more and dwell more into questions, I would be happy to talk more to you.\n\nNope, not boring at all.  Though to be honest, it was very repetitive, and you essentially argued the same point in a few different ways, all of which can be shown to be invalid due to the non-existence of free will.\n\nAs far as follow up questions.\n\n1. Is the Quran the divinely inspired word of Allah? - Is every part of it true?\n1. Where does semen come from in the Quran?\n1. What are stars made from according to the Quran?",

As any being not able to communicate with another being doesn't really exhibit god-like powers in my opinion.\n\n\n> We work with 5 senses in 3d. \n\nWe have more than 5 senses and work in 4 dimensions.\n\n> \u2018God\u2019 is 5d and working with \u2018no sense\u2019 - the human likes to call this non-sense, when in reality, we make no sense. \n\nYou're certainly not making lot of sense :)\n\n> Flip the coin. God delivers messages to a person and it\u2019s up to them and their 5 senses, perspectives, opinions, experiences, etc\u2026to interpret that message. Yaall out here shooting the messenger when it\u2019s really you misinterpreting God. \n\nIt's not us misinterpreting God, it's God being unable to communicate with us in a manner we *can* interpret his message.  Doesn't he want us to understand his message?  If he wants us to understand it, is it just beyond his ability to make us understand it?  If it's not, then why doesn't he send us messages in a way we can understand it?\n\n> It\u2019s an esoteric idea to cope with being a human being. It\u2019s a rough gig that, yes I\u2019m going to say it, you chose. \n\nI didn't choose to be a human (insofar as I didn't choose to be born), nor did I choose to not be convinced of a gods existence.  It's simply how I am.  My brain as it exists, combined with the inputs it has received via my senses, has not been able to be convinced that a god, or gods exist.  It's that simple.  You cannot \"choose\" to believe in something, either you do or you do not, there is no try.\n\n> That\u2019s why God is laughing- at peoples ignorance to a choice they made to live in a human body. \n\nFirst: God's a dick.  Second: We didn't choose to live in a human body. You just some sort of odd troll? Or on a really good drug and just trippin' balls?\n\n> There is a spiritual esoteric aspect to each person. Believers call this God, non believers/science based call this consciousness. \n\nI'm now curious as to which religion you identify as following.  You're seemingly all over the place, or as I said before, very high ;)\n\n> Regardless, it exists and no atheism forum in the world can disprove this \n\nLearn how the burden of proof works.  If you have a theistic claim, it's on you to provide the evidence, not us.  Athiests make no positive claim, theists do.  We claim to not believe in a god or gods, you claim that god or gods exist. This is a positive claim, thus the burden is on you.\n\n> but the majority of people are blinded by hate, bad experiences, bad luck, bad decisions, bad things happening to them etc that \u2018test their faith and go out trying to disprove this and that\u2026you sound bitter enough to be this person.\n\nI'm not bitter, I just prefer to know as many true things and as few false things as possible. So far theism has not met my burden of proof.\n\nFeel free to provide some evidence of a god or gods. I'm ready and willing to believe in the truth, whatever the truth is.",

In my circle of friends, I was the only one with a car so I drove about 4 of us to church on Sundays.  We got fed up with the baptist church for reasons, so we started church shopping and went to the Pentecostal church.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought, \"Well this doesn't seem that different.\" right before the service started.  In the first hymn half the congregation pulled out some kind of musical instrument.  The guy next to me pulled out a recorder, the women in front had castanets.  Lots of hand drums and shakers.  The guy in the back with a saxaphone really caught me off guard.  He barely played to keep from drowning out everyone else.  Then the pastor came out dancing and singing, and borrowed a baby from some woman in the congregation to dance around with while singing.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the moment it felt like, \"You know that sound a high school band makes when everyone is warming up, and no one is in tune or playing together?  What if we made the entire service that,  but with more singing.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen again, I grew up Catholic so that is its own brand of bizarre rituals in \"Important sounding dead languages.\"",

And yet, for some reason God destroyed two whole cities over the mere suggestion of men raping ***men***, and I just can't figure out why the latter crime elicited a more severe reaction? \n\nBasically, these blatant moral inconsistencies showed me that **humans** wrote the Bible according to the standards set by whatever [human] group was in power (which was often cis-het men). God/divine-inspiration had nothing to do with it. Understanding this obvious bias on the part of the authors actually makes biblical nonsense make more sense haha.",

This was back when I still worked part-time for a church, my husband had been laid off and gone back to school (this was in the 2008 crash - he couldn't find another full-time job anyway, so we thought it was the smartest choice.) We had hardly any income and 4 kids.  Our church taught that you had to give 10% of your gross income to the church (specifically, your home church - they always reminded you that if you visited another church, you still owed *them* your tithe). They always taught that if you did this in faith, God would provide for all your needs - maybe not your *wants*, but your *needs*. \n\nWe leaned into that hard. We couldn't afford it, but we trusted.  We ran out of money. We cut our budget. We still ran out of money.  I planted a garden and learned how to preserve food.  We still ran out of money.  I learned how to make our own laundry soap. \n\nAnd so it went. On and on.  Until we were $13,000 in credit card debt, and there was nothing left to cut or for us to do cheaper. \n\nI remember looking at our banking spreadsheet and our budget, trying to figure out how to pay all our bills, and I just put my head down on the desk and started crying because it just wasn't possible.  I started yelling at God in my head, about how he was supposed to be providing, and he wasn't doing that. \n\nThen my inner voice - the one busy ranting at God - suddenly said, \"Did I ask you for that?\"\n\nTo which I responded,  \"Well, they said-\"\n\nTo which my inner voice interrupted and said,  \"Did *I* ask you for that?\"\n\nAnd that was it. It was my own inner voice, although it was calm when I was most definitely not. Was it God? Possibly. It's also very possible it could have been my subconscious manifesting in a protective capacity in response to the constant stress I was under. \n\nIronically, that moment is what led me to research the tithing doctrine, and when that doctrine completely fell apart, to start researching everything else, which eventually led us to leave the church altogether.",

              "text": "See, this was a struggle I had when I was a Christian, now I'm generally spiritual and have modified my concepts of God and consciousness over time\n\nPersonally, I think \"talking to god\" is basically just meditating, or extensive praying, God to me, is consciousness, and consciousness is what our brains make (or transmit, some believe consciousness starts in the brain, others think it's a separate energy that the brain is able to like, translate into a living organism basically)\n\nMy beliefs ebb and flow, normally dependent on how recently I've tripped on acid XD\n\nBut yeah, using Moses as an example under my context I gave, he wouldn't have literally heard a separate entity say these things, it would've been the result of some, or a lot, of isolation and praying/meditation\n\nAnd when you removed all the other stimuli, sight, sound, smell, when you meditate, you're able to turn all of that into white noise basically, and IMO, that's closer to base consciousness, imagine what a late stage baby is thinking in the womb, we don't know, but their senses are probably limited, and the only stimuli they have is the feelings within their body and their mothers, and any touch happening to her stomach, so yeah, like 9 months of meditation right? That's my idea of God, consciousness without the burden of hormones or propaganda or any other stimuli, just, existing, that's what I think God is, and when you tap into that energy, you can ask questions and get well, answers that come from you, but hopefully if you aren't an asshole or insane and are meditating, that \"god\" you're talking to, might give you some good advice like don't murder or rape people, etc.\n\nSo it's less that god talks to someone, and more that someone reaches out, tries to get closer to that base consciousness and gains some new insight, it's all within them, us, you, me, not a separate entity. We're all the same, God is us, we are God, etc.\n\nAnyone can tap into it, but the people that made the Bible, or at least pushed it, before that dude translated the Bible it was all in languages your average bloke couldn't read, or they just couldn't read any language, these churches would push the concept that you can only access god through them, that god is a separate entity that can only be in the company of the big religious entities, you'd just listen to the priest, not have your own book to follow along in\n\nIt's a perversion of these messages that the writers found within themselves\n\nAnd that's Giving more credit rhan what's due, likely the original writers had little to no good intentions and it is wholly propaganda, but for me, pretty much every religious text has at least some information with merit, not murdering is in most of them and that's pretty good advice imo XD",

For example, I have faith that the sun will come up tomorrow morning.  There is good reason for having confidence in this belief.  The sun has come up every day in human history.  I understand orbital mechanics enough to understand why the sun is likely to come up tomorrow.\n* Faith can mean accepting an idea without solid evidence.  For example, someone I just met says they have a cat.  I accept that without evidence beyond their claim.  A lot of people do own cats.  It is a reasonable claim.  And, this is important, if I am wrong the consequences of being wrong will be low.\n* Faith can mean accepting an idea despite evidence to the contrary.  For example, someone asks to borrow $10,000 from me.  They claim they will pay me back with the proceeds of the gold mine in their backyard.  I know the geology of our area, and there are no gold mines within a thousand miles.  I can check Google Maps and see my neighbor's backyard; I see nothing that resembles a goldmine.  And, if my friend had a gold mine in their backyard, then why do they need to borrow $10K?  The consequences of being wrong are substantial.  \n\nThe game Christians play is they pretend all three meanings are the same.  Yes, everything boils down to faith.  But as often as possible I like to stay with the first type of faith.  Even if it is just owning a cat, I am going to look at the person's hand to see if there are scratches.  I will look to see if there is cat hair on their clothes.  If I meet them at the grocery store I will glance in their cart to see if they have cat food, litter, or cat toys.  I might ask them the name of their cat.  If I can, I will try to promote the second type of knowledge to the first level.  Items known by the third type of faith are only held with great skepticism.  If the topic is important, then it is prudent to double and triple-check your doubt.  But if the faith does prove to be misplaced, then it is probably best to just reject it.\n\nI treat Google like any other type of claim.  Is it consistent with other things I know?  Is it logical and internally consistent?  The fact that I want it to be true is irrelevant.",

I went down the rabbit hole of Kabbalah, Alchemy, sacred geometry etc. and came to the conclusion that it is all an Astro-Theology, or Astro-Mythology. And most religions are whether they know it or not. In the same vein of Heracles and his twelve labors- a heavenly body travelling through the constellations (zodiac signs). It is the same as Christ and his twelve disciples. The age of Pisces (fish symbol of Christ) started over two thousands years ago as the progression of the equinoxes. In the Greek Pisces is Dionysus -the last Olympian to enter Olympus- the God of Wine making no less. Zodiac signs are viewed as pairs of the sign opposite. The sign opposite is Virgo - the Eternal Virgin. Most of the myths are easily explained if you know what constellations to look for. Many classic artists knew this as well and you can find these motifs represented in religious art. Jacob lying against a rock (Scorpio) seeing angels (Aquilla/Cygnus) ascend and descend a staircase (Milky Way). \n\nIf you understand then that man looked at the heavens and found the Angels within (constellations) and we know that they are just stats/ points of light that man then turned into objects - an Ark, a beast that swallowed Jonah, the end times. Aries the Ram becomes Abraham (literally means Father Ram). They are all made up.",

And while the answer might be that God doesn't want to explain it to you because it's better for you to learn yourself, you should be able to expect clear, articulate verbal communication in whatever language you understand. The world looks exactly as it should if God doesn't exist: a bunch of people desperately claiming / convincing themselves that God exists, while it being brutally obvious that no communication is ever happening beyond the level that would be expected due to mental illness, fraud, and other false positives.",

They believe they will be rewarded 'in the end'. This obviously can not be proven or disproven since there's no one that's lived death to tell the tale... Well there's Jesus but that's a bit controversial and off topic. \n\nAnyways, there's a quote from a famous author, I believe he's still an atheist or at least he was when I listened to him. Jordan Peterson.\nThe quote went something like this; \" you are better off if you live as if God is real\"",

I do agree with it when talking to someone who's not Christian as the actual truth to Pascal's theory is disappointing. I also don't think I'm the 'standard Christian'. After becoming a Christian I started to see a lot of families who would all say they're Christian and would attend Church every week. Yet during the week they would live like any other person and commit what the church would call 'sins' where it would be swearing or deciding to lie about small things, etc. I know these details because many of these families I'm talking about are families of my friends. \n\nWhen people say they're a Christian, I don't believe them until I see the way they live. I also feel that these so called Christians tarnish the whole community of Christians while being complete imposters. I feel sad for people who decide to go away from Christianity because of those people. \n\nPascal's Wager. Thank you for pointing this out. So I'm sure you know what it is. The reason I disagree with it is because of a very true and eye opening verse in the Bible. The wager says that if you 'believe' that God is real, you will be eternally saved blah blah blah. This is completely untrue. The bible is very clear in this. (I'm thankful if you read this, its quite long) \n\nJames 2:14-20\n\n14 What good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but don\u2019t show it by your actions? Can that kind of faith save anyone? 15 Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing, 16 and you say, \u201cGood-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well\u201d\u2014but then you don\u2019t give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do?\r  \n\r  \n17 So you see, faith by itself isn\u2019t enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless.\r  \n\r  \n18 Now someone may argue, \u201cSome people have faith; others have good deeds.\u201d But I say, \u201cHow can you show me your faith if you don\u2019t have good deeds? I will show you my faith by my good deeds.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n19 You say you have faith, for you believe that there is one God.\\[a\\] Good for you! Even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. 20 How foolish! Can\u2019t you see that faith without good deeds is useless.\n\nSo, faith/belief alone will not save you. Pascal's Wager is meaningless. The reason I brought it up with Peterson is because he explained the statement in an interesting way. he explained that believing in God is also believing in the morals and principles of the religion. As a Christian (for me anyways) there is a lot of decisions I make others don't, whether it be to not get drunk at a party (losing your control)- I'm not against others drinking, t*oo much* though- or for example resisting the wants of your flesh and preserving your soul, I'm referring to sex. \n\nI don't believe I am better than other people, I am not perfect and I have my own imperfections, I do however try my best to live according to my principles.",

I was like, whatever, haven\u2019t done that in 30 years and I assume it will be horrible but I\u2019ll go.  \n\nThe people were pretty decent and open minded. But I got stuck on this story that the pastor told: the story of Dorcas. It is covered in a couple paragraphs in some fairly obscure book. The basic story is:\n\n- Dorcas was an old woman in some town near Tel Aviv. She knitted clothes and did a lot of nice stuff for people   \n- She got sick and died. Very saddened by this, everyone washed her body and stuck it upstairs (?) and then got Peter, who was really tight with Jesus.  \n- Peter told everyone to leave the room, then prayed and said \u201cTabitha! Stand up!\u201d. (Somehow the name Dorcas=Tabitha).   \n- that\u2019s it, she was resurrected  \n- Peter went and stayed with a pig farmer name Simon   \n\nSo I was just, wtf was with that story? First, \u201cDorcas\u201d is a hilarious name. Mainly, are we really supposed to believe she was raised from the dead? Why doesn\u2019t that happen anymore? Why did Dorcas deserve that and not all the other people who die every day? The pastor just ignored all of this and talked about how she symbolized a gazelle.  \n\nMy girlfriend got all pissed. I was \u201cmocking\u201d the pastor and Bible. Uh, no, I\u2019m just discussing the sermon. So, Dorcas led this life of charity and then she was finally dead and in heaven, so they *resurrected* her to make her come back and knit for people? Is that what she would have wanted??\n\nAnyway discussing this was just way past my girlfriend and she never said anything at all except that she was angry at me.  Obviously this only scratches the surface as far as insane and inane Bible stories. Anyway that was my question: am I really supposed to believe this shit as literal history?",

Essentially this means that when people go against divine law (the holy commandments and statutes) they are deserving of judgement and death. This type of death is a spiritual death or a disconnect from God. The reason for this is that God is holy and righteous. We also know from scripture \u201call have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God\u201d. So all of us are living in Gods grace in mercy. We exist, outside of Gods perfect righteousness with free will because of his love and tolerance, he is teaching us to trust his commandments and statutes instead of outright forcing them. Your examples are part of OT teachings when Gods way of reconciling with humans was different than it was after Jesus. God executed judgement many times, for example the flood of Noah\u2019s time and even commissioning the pillaging and murdering of Canaanites. He wasn\u2019t murdering these people maliciously but graciously ordering their death in order to bring humanity back to the right way of living. Many of your examples include sinners include people who sinned ignorantly and knowingly. You may not believe anything I said here, which is fine. But my point is the Bible makes perfect sense logically, its just weather or not you believe it. Thats what makes an atheist an atheist and a Christian a Christian.",

Also there were the \u201clost gospels\u201d that were discovered in 1945 somewhere in Egypt. And they talk about his childhood. \n\nFound this in an article: \n\nThe most shocking of the apocryphal writings is the Infancy Gospel of Thomas. It includes a story in which the child Jesus calls another child an \u201cunrighteous, irreverent idiot\u201d (3:1-3). It features stories in which young Jesus strikes other children dead for o\ufb00enses like bumping into him (4:1-2; see also 14:3).",

This is because of many documents that are written are dated, and some have been dated through carbon or other methods.\nThis is a very good topic though and is thoroughly discussed in a book I would recommend everyone to read if your ignorant to the topic which it seems most here are. I was to at one point, and no I'm not Christian nor did the book make me want to be one, but it adds a whole lot of clarity and understanding.\n\"THE CASE FOR CHRIST\" I'm sure you could probably just Google specifics if you don't want to read it all, but the books are pretty solid of the new testament that are about Jesus.\nTo include the Torah and Karan both back up the Bible on so many accounts. Sorry I don't remember all the specifics and would definitely get stuff wrong so I hope you all actually look at this and do a little learning, since I've seen so many inclined to just spout out a bunch of bullshit..\n\nSo yea \nCase for Christ  the book should answer most of your questions about who wrote the books, when, and how are they so directly connected.\nThese were not written through divine intervention and not from hearing \"god\". They were simply scribing.\nThe hearing \"god\" came long before these men wrote it down in a book.",

The Pharisees were not in power - the Romans were, in connection with the elite priesthood/Sadducees. The Pharisees were an out group themselves. In addition, the gospels were written after the destruction of the Temple - that is, when the Sadducees were thrown from their pedestal and the Pharisees were gaining prominence.

Thomas, the only guy with some sense, is like, dude, you're clearly not Jesus. Then this imposter Jesus is like, \"I'll prove it's me! Look at the holes in my hands and feet! Seriously guys, there's NO ONE ELSE that can possibly have these same holes\", despite the fact that thousands of other people were crucified in those times and Jesus was even crucified with 2 other dudes. And Thomas, who was dealing with grief like all the other apostles, figured this was enough proof and proclaims this imposter Jesus must be the real deal.\n\nLike, for real, if you dedicate your life to a holy man, then he's killed, you'd be questioning your faith and you're entire life. You'd be looking for ANY sign that your faith is still justified. So that's why all the apostles were so ready to accept this stranger as Jesus purely because he said he was and had similar scars (if this was even true at all).\n\nAny story after Jesus was \"resurrected\" was so far-fetched, it was clearly made up because the apostles didn't want to be embarrassed that they wasted their life following a cult leader who was killed incredibly easily. And millions still follow it to this day.\n\nI honestly don't even think Imposter Jesus was real, and that the entire story after real Jesus' death was fabricated. The writers threw in a \"doubting\" character to make it seem more genuine, but even then, this character folds immediately. The writers clearly weren't very good and had no real material. They had no clue how to end the story, so they just has Jesus ascend, and that was it. Like the ending of Greece.",

However, what is interesting about Christianity to me - a non-Christian with an interest in history - is how diverse it was compared to other faiths, and pretty much right after it was started. There was a massive divergence of various Christian cults, each with a different interpretation of what Jesus said and meant.\n\nWhich is what happens when you don\u2019t write anything down in your life.",

So the \u201cgospel according to mark\u201d is the good news that Jesus talked about, as this dude Mark knows it. \n\nThe likely reason why Jesus himself didn\u2019t think it was important to write down his message was that if you read the gospels, it\u2019s pretty clear that Jesus expected the world as we know it to end, and very soon. He says something to the disciples along the lines of \u201csome of you won\u2019t know death until the kingdom comes\u201d, meaning it would happen in their lifetimes. OG Christians (if they can be called that) legit thought the world was going to end soon, and the modern concepts of heaven and the second coming only came later to explain why, in fact, the world didn\u2019t end as Jesus predicted.\n\nTLDR: Jesus didn\u2019t write his own gospels because he was a crazy end times preacher who thought the world was in its final years",

You can only ever communicate honestly and completely with another person directly, and when you do you gain a little temporary perspective. They just did that to a degree most people never experience or recognize. When the teachings then get passed on, there's two perspectives embedded and the truth is impossible to discern because one is impossible to truly know. Unless you've already had a moment of epiphany, you can recognize what they talk about even thousands of years later through shared experience (or delusion, but hey if the result is a more genuine person should we care?).\n\nStill as i say, it's different for everyone. Not \"God\" as we think of it, but a clarity of personal perspective and limitation and *really* comprehending the isolated, flawed nature of the human mind. At least to me.",

A moment of shared relative perspective. When you pass this information on the original perspective becomes impossible to discern, you can only ever know it as it appears to you. The \"enlightenment\" they had in my opinion, is a clarity of complete perspective. That is, they saw for the first time just how limited their perspective is. Something most people think they're aware of, but they're nowhere near it. The resultant implication is empathy and tolerance knowing none of us can ever overcome the subjective nature of ourselves.\n\nThe journey to that point has to be driven internally, you can't be led there, especially not by someone who's never been there themselves. Learning to learn honestly and directly is the point, that's why Jesus didn't write down his teachings and neither did the disciples who knew him.",

                      "text": "Basically the divinity of Christ was decided by politicians hundreds of years after Jesus' death.\n\nThe Roman Empire was in decline and this Christianity thing was popular underground so the emporer said \"no one's into this Greek-based Zeus-type shit anymore let's adopt this fledging religion as the official government religion\". So they did. And they held a meeting to decide what was and wasn't official. Stuff like \"so Jesus was officially God's son and died and was resurrected and is part of the holy trinity\". They just made up the rules hundreds of years later. \n\nThat's how the Catholic Church is centered in Rome (well the Vatican I guess). Weird that of all places a religion that started with a dude born in the middle east would see HQ reside in Italy right? It's because an empire was shopping for a new religion at the right time. \n\nInteresting stuff how it cascaded through Western history for thousands of years. As the Roman Empire split and faded politically the religious aspect continued to influence medieval and then Renaissance Europe. Just like the Roman Empire stuck with us in many ways that's how I'm sitting here on the west coast of North America surrounded by churches for a religion that was rag tag 2000 years ago on the other side of the planet.",

It was hard because most religiona were old and set in stone. Christianity was not. It was new and therefore easy to manipulate since a lot of it hadn\u2019t been decided. They made and decided on lot things we now would consider Christian facts. For example they decided on the idea of the trinity. You know, the whole there is God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit as three aspects of the same God. And they also decided the Jesus was divine and not just some dude created by god.\n\nThey also incorporated many others religious ideas and made them a part of Christian story. For example, the story of Jesus\u2019s being killed and rising on the 3rd day was take from Mythra who was an egyptian god who died and rose on the 3rd day. Bam! Now that\u2019s part of Jesus\u2019s story. The pagans in Rome had a festival over the course of week in late December that culminated around December 25 and gave presents. It was called Saturnalia. Well now we celebrate it on December 25th Bam! That\u2019s now part of Christianity. Jesus wasn\u2019t even born in December, as far as I know. It goes on and on. Saint Nick was a man who attended this council and became the inspiration for Santa Claus.\n\nIt\u2019s all really interesting stuff. It goes further into future Emperors like Justinian having Christian art and churches built to further create more culture and fake history for their people to unite behind.",

If your God is really an omnipotent God, and the Bible is divinely inspired, the writers of the Gospels could've been born in 1992 and still be right. Faith is the confidence in things hoped for and all that. (Although I'm an atheist, I personally don't deliberately try to challenge people's faith unless they ask me or enter a debate forum. If believing in gods, ghosts or djinn makes people happy and they're not trying to impose that faith on me, why should I care?)\n\nBut for him, although that made sense, it was more about the error itself. His entire life he's been told that the Bible was written one way and then it turns out that it hasn't. If the people teaching him knew that, then they've been lying to him his whole life. And if the people teaching him *didn't* know that, what *else* don't they know about this religion that they were basing the way they made him live his life on?\n\nAnd I mean...come on, that's a pretty big thing. The Gospels are written as eyewitness accounts, and presented to Christian adherents as if they were eyewitness accounts. They even have fake names on them! It just feels a lot more credible if these four dudes were hanging out with Jesus, saw all this stuff together, wrote it all down and that's how we got the Gospels.\n\n\"These were written several decades to perhaps a hundred years after Jesus lived, were a collection of oral histories that had been well-circulated for many years before they were written, and were probably written by many anonymous people instead of one dude\" isn't quite the same story of a hallowed disciple's divine inspiration.",

There was a variety of crazy prophet types running around the area at the time, and Jesus likely had a common name equivalent to Joshua today. You can imagine how, in a time where the main source of news is word of mouth, a game of telephone could quickly turn several crazy prophets into one amazing prophet with various magical powers.\n\nSo in short, Jesus was probably very loosely based on one or more persons, but the biblical Jesus never existed.",

I never learned any of the interesting things about the Bible while I was a Christian in church studying the Bible. \n\nI think atheists should likewise study the Bible, both because it's just interesting human history still relevant and active in the world, and because understanding how the Bible came to be the way it is provides a lot of insight into how religion, power, culture, and politics work and shape eachother over time.",

You're not going to convince them otherwise. You may as well argue about the color of the sky. It helps ME now to see just what total bullshit all of it was, but \"believers\" don't want facts. They want the comfort of lies.",

The Iliad is much more questionable from stand point of number of copies and or lack of original texts. But I never hear people say the homer probably didn\u2019t exist or there have been translations and edits for two thousand years which is why the Greek mythology is incorrect. We don\u2019t believe in Greek mythology not because of some source criticism but because of the content. \n\nThat\u2019s ultimately my point, the source criticism of the Bible is a weak reason to believe it or not, especially because the Bible holds up pretty well to that criticism. Now content wise, that\u2019s where there is something worth saying.",

The French had been watching the war with interest, thinking that the British losing control of their North American colonies would be good for France and bad for Britain, but they didn't want to openly enter the war unless it looked like the colonists were going to win.\n\nAfter they did win at Saratoga, France - and later Spain, because of their alliance with France - formed an alliance with the Americans, providing resources that the colonists desperately needed to continue fighting. Yorktown was fought by American colonists and French soldiers side by side - and that was enabled by the Spanish armada, who agreed to protect the French merchant ships in the West Indies so that the French navy could send all their warships into battle.\n\nWe like to tell the story as if a little ragtag bunch of Davidic colonists with some heart and gumption took on the Goliath of the British Army and beat them out of sheer force of will.",

Lots of contemporary people were keeping records about the American Revolution when it was going on, which writers now could reference for their book. In Jesus' day, most people were illiterate, and when Jesus was alive, he wasn't a topic that the scholars of the day chose to write about.\n\nNot only this though, the original bible as written in the centuries after his death has been corrupted over the years by people with agendas. Entire books were left out of the bible cannon, which many say deserve to be in there. It was selectively edited, not just in its included books, but also in its translations from Latin. The church chose translations for words which fit the message that they wanted to get along. Early religious leaders labeled Mary Magdalen as a prostitute. That's not directly stated in the bible, but they adapt other bible statements to include her in that. Now we know that \"The Gosphel of Mary\" is a book that exists, but wasn't included in the bible, and some of the left out books \"the gnostic texts\" present Mary Magdelin as being above other disciples, and possibly even Jesus' wife. While Jesus may have been a champion of equality and womens rights, that made early Christian leaders uncomfortable, so they changed & filtered Jesus' teachings.",

Sure, the literacy rate among the Jewish population was only around 3%, but the Roman literacy rate was closer to 10% and much higher among that aristocracy that would govern Judea at the time. And if there are two things the Roman Empire was known for, it was aqueducts and writing shit down. So, its not just scholars writing shit down. Its tax collectors, census takers, courts, historians, random graffiti on the walls, etc.\n\nThere wasn't just some set group of scholars that were in charge of recording everything they felt important. There were enough literate people from many walks of life that we have records for.\n\nFor example, we have plenty of names of Rabbis and some even have similar names to Jesus, but none of the deeds describe match up with the bible.\n\n>Not only this though, the original bible as written in the centuries after his death has been corrupted over the years by people with agendas.\n\nAnd yeah, that is the point trying to be made. Not a single word was written about Jesus by someone who actually met him. And not a word until over 4 decades after his alledged death. So, even the oldest, uncorrupted sources are unreliable at best.",

Of course, although Romans persecuted the jews, a lot of that got 'lost' in translation. A great many religious works were left out because they didn't fit into the political climate of the day. Once it was released, all other religious writings were ordered to be burned and all religious orders had to adopt the Bible \"or else\".

Yohanan ben Zakkai, major figure of the Mishnah, was pro-Roman (or at least anti-revolt) in 70 CE and the Flavian Dynasty granted him settlements in which he helped midwife Rabbinical Judaism.\n\nPersecution of the Jews did occur, but it wasn\u2019t constant or always legal. After both sides of the Hasmonean Civil War invited Rome to side with them, Rome sided with the religious leaders of Israel and made them a semi-autonomous monarchal vassal before absorption as a province. Jewish men began serving with distinction in the Roman military and Jewish communities spread beyond Egypt, Greece, and the Levant (some polytheistic Jews were still worshipping YHWH alongside older gods at the border of Nubia). There was some friction, and of course each rebellion against Rome saw Jewish communities divided about whether Rome was to be obeyed as a pagan force appointed by God or attacked as an evil entity. The disruption to Roman security and Jewish traditions and monotheism often led to undue prejudice, amplified certainly after the Kitos War when a rebel organization orchestrated the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Roman civilians across the Eastern Empire.\n\nThis is all to say that saying \u201cRomans persecuted Jews\u201d is a major gloss.\n\nAnyway, what major works written by Jews were removed from the Christian canon but retained in the Jewish canon?\n\nAnd how does your historical reading deal with the canon discussions of Marcion and Eusebius, both of which address canon structuring predating Constantine\u2019s council?\n\nI\u2019m not a Christian but I get worried about the effects of atheism fora misrepresenting the historical context of early Christianity. It doesn\u2019t make atheist communities look too intellectually rigorous.",

So, when Constantine commissioned the Bible it's most likely that he would want to censor religious literature that would put Romans in a bad light. As a result there were probably many facts misrepresented. For example, I've read that the 'washing of hands' after a trial was more of a Jewish ritual than Roman. If so, it may be that Pilate wasn't the one doing the hand washing. I don't know how much truth there is to that but it's possible that, for centuries, the jews were castigated because it was held that they were responsible for the death of Christ.

He abrogated one part of the Torah: not the laws on forced labor or on banning the murder of homosexuals, but on restricting divorce only to the case of adultery. He never condemned the homophobia of his contemporary Hebrew religious heritage. And he told a parable whose punchline was a forced laborer being tortured by his owner for being cruel.\n\nThere\u2019s no good Jesus to be rescued from the proliferation of documents written in his name and voice beyond and in the Roman Empire.

The gospels were each attributed to a specific follower of Jesus.\n\nNow modern scholarship has shown that 3 of the gospels were using similar source materials in how they came together (language, syntax, etc.) and so were likely using an unknown anonymous/lost source, and so probably weren't written by those to whom authorship is ascribed.  Also that some letters attributed to Paul weren't written by the same person as other letters attributed to Paul.  But its not the same as saying they're anonymous.  The claim is that they come from people who were there.",

The Pharoah that opposes Moses shares the name of the then current Pharoah of Egypt who was harrasing the Jewish resettlement. The monotheistic cult was only one of several religions practiced by the Pre Babylon Israelites.\n\n\nI may have gotten some of the proper nouns wrong. There's good reason why the majority of seminary graduates end up leaving the religion.",

Yahweh worship was indeed the most prominent of the cults among the Israelites at this time, but the key point is that it wasn\u2019t strictly speaking monotheistic. It was henotheistic, aka they believed there were lots of gods, just Yahweh was their god. That led to Yahweh being the strongest god and then being the only god. And even that narrative doesn\u2019t take into account that centuries before this Yahweh merged into the existing pantheon headed by El. Or that some Jews on the fringe in Egypt (Elephantine) were polytheistic well after the exile. \n\ninterestingly, Yahweh does seem to come from the south, Moses is an Egyptian name, and Yahweh narrative vis a vis Moses seems like it was separable from the rest of the Bible, hinting that there was some sort of unique Egyptian-ish Moses narrative that merged into the other Israelite narrative. If you squint you can see something of an \u201cExodus\u201d in that, but not much.",

There could have been an itinerant Jewish rabi named Jesus or Jeshua who was preaching in and around Galilee at that time, or there could have been several such preachers and many of the stories were condensed into a single figure that was either real or imagined.\n\nThe point is that if there was such a person, we have no reason to believe he was divine. We have these stories, and people believe them. I find it more engaging to tackle the ideas and supposed miracles of those stories and point out the lack of evidence for them than to attack the historicity of Jesus.",

I'm not saying that individual was Jesus, maybe Jesus is a made up amalgamation and someone who made some pretty clever and nuanced ethical arguments was lumped in there. No way to know, as then Jesus has plenty of other things attributed to him that are surface level and just lack the same depth of thought and I'm like \"did the same person really come up with these same statements?\"",

I don't agree with you, but you would simply be going with the arguments you find convincing. \n\nHowever, if you are to assert that this idea is considered anything but fringe by accredited historians, then you are simply wrong. \n\nIf you want to question the work these historians do, then enter the field of history and publish a peer reviewed paper. It is more than just \"critical thinking\" (as if these professors are somehow incapable of it): it is about understanding the process that historians use to come to likely conclusions. It is very common to not have direct physical evidence for a specific single person from thousands of years ago after they have lived and died. \n\nThis might better explain what I'm getting at:\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/For-which-historical-people-do-we-have-less-evidence-that-they-existed-than-for-the-historical-Jesus\n\n\"We have less evidence for 90% of figures from the ancient world than Jesus. To begin with, we have less evidence for every single other early first century Jewish prophet, preacher or Messianic claimant. Theudas, the Egyptian, Onias, the Samaritan Prophet, Hillel, Shammai, Athronges - all of these are mentioned in one or, at best, two sources, all decades or even centuries after the fact.\n\nAnd this is normal in ancient history for any figure that was not a leader, ruler or general and even for many who were. You can open a copy of Tacitus, Pliny, Plutarch, Cassius Dio or any other ancient historian and the vast majority of people mentioned will be (i) mentioned just once or twice and (ii) mentioned decades or centuries after the fact. And this is the case for many people who were senators, important priests or renowned generals.\n\nThis is why the arguments that because there are only a few mentions of Jesus or because they are not contemporary mentions he didn't exist are so totally absurd to anyone with a grasp of the nature of ancient source material.\"\n\nEverytime an atheist states \"Jesus never existed \" with infallible confidence, you prove to Christians you are okay with using faulty argumentation.",

The Bible isn\u2019t even clear on these issues from one gospel to the next. there was no census, there are no contemporary accounts, even John admits he never met him. No record of Pontius Pilate\u2019s order of execution. It\u2019s all super thin and suppositional because there is no real evidence. If there were you\u2019d have pulled it up on google when you looked. Instead you got \u201cfolks agree that folks agree that the Bible is right\u201d. \n\nAnyway who cares? I honestly don\u2019t think he was a real person. There are so many myths that predate and preview the broad strokes of his story that it just smells like bullshit to me. Im not being disingenuous.  But it really doesn\u2019t matter. As has been pointed out in this thread a couple times  now, maybe there was a person who the stories were based on. However, that person\u2019s mom had sex, that person performed no miracles, was no more god than you or I, and when he died, he died.  Joseph Smith was a real person and the religion he founded is the exact same level of bullshit as all of the others.  Believe what you want, good luck to you.",

We know that the money changers existed and that they would overcharge pilgrims on their way to worship at the temple.\n\nEvidence for this has shown up in Roman writings, Hebrew writings, and graffiti around the area.\n\nIt's not a stretch to think that an uppity rabbi could have driven those sorts of people out of the temple with a whip.\n\nWhat is a stretch is ascribing any supernatural powers to such an individual.\n\nSo yeah, the one story of Jesus driving the money changers out of the temple might have actually been true, if you don't exactly ascribe it to Jesus specifically.\n\nBut you can also see how the sort of figure who would drive the money changers out of the temple would inspire loyalty in the poor masses, loyalty that with a bit of con-man talent would spawn a new religion...\n\nYou also have to remember that it's never the founder who makes it a religion, it's always the guy who comes next. In this case we know that it was Paul, who was a Roman citizen named Saul, and contrary to modern belief, carried both names his entire life.\n\nHe's the one who likely spun most of the supernatural tales into it. And likely added a shit load more.\n\nThen the Council of Nicaea took Paul's and other grifter's writings and turned them into a book that *they* could grift from.",

Practically a 3rd of the book, at least half the NT, is written by a guy who literally hunted and killed Christians while working as a Jewish religious leader. Canonically killed the first martyr/saint. The teachings of Christ emphasize how untrustworthy the Pharisees were, how important it is to think first about love and acceptance and not dwell on specific rules touted by religious leaders... then here comes Paul, former Pharisee, to immediately start telling everybody how to live their lives more Jesus-like by following strict rules and being all judgy. \n\nHe basically rebranded the Pharisee bullshit, specifically denounced in the gospels, and said it was all cool because god told him so. It was incredibly sus. Of course a version of the church looking to centralize its power and control its congregants would agree with him, though. Can't control people through a religion that says you shouldn't try to control people through their religion, so yeah... Council of Nicea padded the book out with the rants of a man who may well have been the kind of grifter Jesus warned about.",

The First Council of Nicaea as you mentioned, and its ruling on what would become the Arian heresy specifically - and the logic behind it - demonstrates a far more thorough and reasoned approach to Christianity than we have today. In fact, the survival of Christianity as a religion depended upon that reasoning.\n\nAnd yet if you ask the average American Christian whether Jesus was a. born human, b. born divine, or c. born both, it\u2019s practically guaranteed that they don\u2019t know what they believe. It\u2019s also entirely likely that if they have an answer, it may contradict the Council\u2019s ruling.\n\nThe history of Christianity as a religion and institution - its founding, organization, and spread - is fascinating and it\u2019s such a shame that, as far as I am aware, Christians today do not care for their own religion\u2019s historical background.",

              "text": "Jesus warned about false Christs. He also said no one should call themselves \"teacher\" or \"rabbi\" or \"father\" because there is only one, and that the greatest among you would not place themselves in such a position, but instead make themselves your servant. And he was only ever really wrathful at people making money off religion, and you know all the pharisee stuff in spots like Matthew chapter 23 which describe modern Christianity to a tee as if religious history has just repeated itself. And really if you read the book it just does that over and over and over since God's chosen people tried to kill Moses, and then the prophets, and then their messiah. Christians somehow ignore the last 2K years of shit history on their forefather's part and assume they're the chosen people of God now they got this down no prob. Romans chapter 11 even Paul warns the gentiles not to get arrogant or \"your branch could also be cut off.\" But they'll just cherry pick John 3:16 or something of the sort while ignoring the other stuff about \"not all who say Lord Lord\" \"depart from me I never knew you\" or \"I will vomit you out of my mouth because you are lukewarm.\" or \"faith without works is dead.\"\n\nAnd despite what I noted above, modern Christianity is literally a system of people calling themselves teachers, pastors, and father and making a career out of it. That's why churches are built up mostly near nice suburbs and not ghettos, because that's where its profitable to do so. And they do more helping overseas than in their own community because the missionary makes a career out of that while the congregation sits on their ass and lets their inner city rot because they wouldn't be caught going down \"that street\" much less try to understand the life of circular poverty and crime and the absolute lack of fucks anyone gives who never has to experience it. \n\n\"You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when you have succeeded, you make them twice as much a child of hell as you are.\" - Jesus\n\nAnd its really convenient for fundamentalism if you can just quote the one that says \"All scripture is given by inspiration of God.\" It's like their religious trump card to placate any questions of contradiction, or if that one doesn't work they can just say \"God works in mysterious ways\" as if we haven't heard that line enough. As if specific groups of fallible humans who participated in colonialism and slavery in the name of Christ didn't decide which scriptures make the cut for that \"all scripture\" part. How is King James any different from Joseph Smith or any other that claims to have God's plan all laid out for you? And how does any apologist look themselves in the mirror after glossing over so much contradiction and disillusionment built into the whole damn narrative? I certainly couldn't. Hell why can't they just come out and admit that they're all frauds, and pretenders. Do they really think that they are disciples of Christ? If Jesus was legit incarnation then his disciples all lie at the bottom of catacombs and the whole thing was repeatedly hijacked and warped systematically. And so people lean on the scriptures as if the thing doesn't also point out that those scriptures can be used the wrong way. As if their doctrine isn't also an inheritance of mere principles that can also be skewed in the entire wrong direction because a tradition is only as good as the people who actually handle it. And do they even wonder why no one in their religion performs actual miracles or prophesies except for grifters and/or psychopaths?\n\nMy father, grandfather, and great grandfather were all pastors. So you can imagine growing up in a time like this where all of the mindless ego of their precious doctrine and traditionalism came crashing down in the world around me.\n\nI always leaned towards critical thinking and rational thought, so I always sought a way to make sense of things through these narrow lenses I was given. But eventually I had to see outside of their view, and it was easiest to find the resolve to do so when I saw clear examples in the world around me of people experiencing religious trauma. So I went through that process intensively for the last few years. I learned that we can physically change our own minds; that any thought, no matter how deeply engrained, is a choice in the here and now. The problem isn't the ability to change, but the will. So I set out on a path of examining my own thoughts critically, and with humility and respect for the human experience, not just my own. And to understand that no matter how much information and seeking of truth I set out to do; with perspective, life did not evolve into such a consciousness very long ago.  And I myself did not evolve my own thinking until I experienced a great deal of my own trauma. I worked at a Juvenile Hall for 10 years and was exposed to the dark underbelly of our society which hides its recurring systematic problems in jail cells because they do not value anything but themselves and their precious religiosity. I can't pin all the blame on Christians, but from all of this talk of living in a \"christian nation\" you would think some of these disciples of Christ would actually start helping the poor like he said to, rather than voting specifically to oppress the poor and blame all of the problems this false system has created on them. But I've ranted long enough and I could go on about that experience for another mile of text. I wish a very good night to you if you somehow managed to read this far down.",

There is very little doubt both that he was real, and that he was quite Jewish.\n\nBut while his avocation was as an orator and religious leader, his profession was as a tent maker, indicating he was some type of artisan, possibly a leather worker. Aka he was like a tradesman class Roman citizen of Jewish faith who received an upper class Jewish religious education on top of his trade training. He was fanatic as a Jew, and later as a Christian. So eventually his leadership in the church brought him to a position where his avocation finally became his profession.\n\nEdit: think of it this way: what if the Torah was your TV? That\u2019s kind of like who Paul was. Ultra religious fanboy \u201cstop liking what I don\u2019t like\u201d",

As in the Book of Revelations.  \n\n\nIf a religious truth is 'revealed', it means that I might not have seen it in my waking life, but that it was extra special because it was revealed to me by some inexplicable magic something or another. I never saw a beast devouring all the nations, but I'm super-duper sure of it, because it was revealed to me. I think.  \n\n\nPicture the leprous priests from the movie 300, and their orgy consort, the high-out-of-her-mind teenaged oracle. Her message was one that only the lepers could interpret, and one that Leonidas couldn't refute with any logic available, because she spoke a super convenient *revealed* truth.   \n\n\nMany of the most well-known passages in the New Testament, especially Matt/Mark/Luke/John and their letters to various regional churches (that is, many of the books of the Bible frequently cited in sermons today) begin with phrases like \"And after he considered all he had heard, an angel of God appeared in a dream and told him... something...\"  \n\n\nMatthew doesn't say \"I witnessed something miraculous.\" He says \"I heard some strange tales, thought about them, then had a dream that an angel came and told me there was a man born of a virgin.\"  \n\n\nRevelations are special because they can't be arrived at by conventional means. They can't be verified or falsified, because they never really happened. They were revealed in miraculous non-events *somewhere* in the past.",

The idea of questioning christianity was still so fragile in my mind that I really didn't understand *why* I felt SO compelled to underline and highlight one specific set of verses out of everything in the bible.\n\nI highlighted the section condoning slavery. When I got a new bible years later, I immediately found the verses and did it again. It was like my little seed of truth in a sea of lies that I kept hidden as I tended it, protected it, and helped it grow.\n\nMy brainwashed kid brain couldn't form my doubt as words, it was more of a deeply unsettling feeling that there was something terribly sinister about that passage, as if I were catching a glimpse of the mouth of hell but not the fire brimstone imaginary kind, the brutal cruel and horrifically real hell of slavery.\n\nAs an adult I can put words to the feelings it gave me, to give voice to the thoughts I was too scared to hear and hold in my mind think back then:\n\nIf the bible is the absolute word of God and the bible says slavery can be okay, then the bible is wrong and the word of God is evil and cruel.",

In Mormon stakes, there is a group called the High Priests who basically sit around on Sundays and talk about this kind of thing.  There is no sound doctrine surrounding it, and in fact the church is even backing away from the whole \"as man is now, god once was\" -- BUT when I grew up in the church, this was definitely taught.  It makes a lot of sense until you wonder where the first god came from, and it kind of unravels at that point.\n\nBut, yes, I was taught that every world has a trinity.  Every world has a chosen son (Jesus) who takes upon himself the sins of that world.  Men have \"countless\" wives in heaven so as to create the spirit children for the next cycle.",

That community tends to reject outsiders and people who leave it. You very will might be socially ostracized for publicly questioning the dogma let alone leaving it. That church is where you went to Sunday school, its where you know some of your friends from, you might've used the church basement for birthday parties and baby showers, that's where you've been to weddings and funerals, its just a really central part of some communities.

One of the earliest references to Christians at all comes from Tacitus who wrote about them being blamed for setting the great fire of Rome in 64 AD. \n\n> all human efforts, all the lavish gifts of the emperor, and the propitiations of the gods, did not banish the sinister belief that the conflagration was the result of an order. Consequently, to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called \"Chrestians\" by the populace.\n\n> Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilate, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome, where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular.\n\nFor such a supposedly famous and disruptive figure as Christ is said to have been, it's odd don't you think that meticulous historians such as the Romans wouldn't have mentioned him once before 64AD?",

He could be a complete fabrication. \n\nThere was an ossuary shown in 2002 with the inscription James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus in Aramaic. The ossuary is from the 1st century but I think it was determined the inscription was a forgery. Either way, those are common names. Jesus\u2019s name is Yeshua which in English is Joshua. We get Jesus from the Greek equivalent to Yeshua. My point being that even if the inscription was real it really wouldn\u2019t prove anything.\n\nThe oldest existing part of the new testament isn\u2019t even the gospels. It\u2019s paul\u2019s letters. There might have been more contemporary writing but they have been lost to time. \n\nJesus might have existed but people like him were common and his life was exaggerated later.

What happened in Rome was important, what happened elsewhere wasn't - unless it affected Rome.\n\nAlso, Jesus was just one in a long line of itinerant Jewish preachers, following a long tradition all the way back to the Old Testament prophets.  They preach, sometimes they make too much noise and get executed, and ten years later another one comes along.  John the Baptist was one such, and there were others before him.  In 64 AD, Jesus was just one of these, and not particularly distinguished amongst them.  Why take notice?\n\nChristianity only became important to Rome once there were a large number of believers, and that didn't happen until after the Jewish Temple was destroyed in 70 AD.  The Romans also had a lot of trouble distinguishing between Judaism and Christianity at the beginning.  \n\nSo Jesus only became famous and disruptive retrospectively, after there were hundreds of thousands of believers in the religion founded in his name.

If some of the events in the bible actually occurred the way it's claimed, you'd expect a lot of people to take notice, people would be writing about it, it would be pretty likely that at least some solid record would survive, but we haven't really found that.",

              "text": "I think a lot of scholars date Paul's letters even earlier.  Generally during the 50s.\n\nBut your point is correct.  At least some of the Apostles were probably still alive. In fact, Paul mentions both Peter and James, the brother of Jesus in his letters.  He met with them for 15 days.  And, he obviously was not impressed by them.  Acts was written in the late 90s, so most of the witnesses including Paul were probably dead.  If there were any eyewitnesses left they were probably scattered and not in a position to challenge Acts.  Acts disagrees with Paul on many points.  Acts retels some of Paul's stories, but the Acts versions are orders of magnitudes more dramatic.  For example, Paul's letters show he doesn't like Peter.  But in Acts Paul and Peter become best buddies and in total agreement.    Comparing Acts to Paul's letters makes it clear that the author of Acts was creating mythology.  It is clear the same thing is going on with Jesus mythology in the gospels.\n\nPaul's authentic letters are an anomally in the Bible.  In that sense, /u/Skelastomybag was correct.  Then entire Bible except for the 7 letters of Paul are written by unknown authors.  Even if you take something like Revelation, we know it was written by \"John\" but we have no idea which John.",

                              "text": "Some things were probably mistakes.  For example, the gospels make some mistakes about where various towns are located.  Those are the kind of mistake that is easy to dismiss.  It works against the idea of Bible literalism, but I was a Christian who did not believe in literalism.\n\nThere are other mistakes that might be attributed to miscopying or mistranslation from Aramaic to Greek.  \n\nOther errors are probably inconsequential.  For example, one gospel says that Peter denied Jesus 3 times *before* the cock crowed.  Another gospel says Peter denied Jesus 3 times *after* the cock crowed.  Personally, I don't think it really matters.  Literalists say Peter denied Jesus 6 times.  That kind of argument is ridiculous and unnecessary if you don't demand literalism.\n\nBut there are systemic fictions that appear to be intentionally fictional.  For example, take the Sea of Galillee.  Greek mythology often took place on a storm-tossed sea.  The hero of the story would demonstrate they had mastery over nature by doing things like calming storms and moving across the surface of a sea.   The author of Mark was trained in Greek literature.  He had the problem of Palestine not having a storm-tossed sea for Jesus to show his mastery over.  THere was only Lake Tiberius.  It is surrounded by mountains on three sides, and it is known for being very tranquil.  It is fresh water, and it is not close to being big enough to be considered a sea.  At the time of Jesus the Lake was about half of its current size.  But the author of Mark transformed the tranquil lake into a storm-tossed sea for his narrative.  The lake could have been easily crossed in an afternoon in a rowboat, but Mark portrays a multi-day voyage on a sailboat.  That is not an accidental error.  It looks very intentional.\n\nThere are many other examples that seem to be falsehoods that are organically built into the gospel story.   The nativity stories have examples.  Herod never conducted the \"Slaughter of the Innocents.\"  There were Roman historians who hated Herod and portrayed him as irrationally violent.  If he had done anything like slaughtering all baby boys under age 2 they would have been very happy to recount it.  Or there is the census in Luke.  The realities of the census did not even come close to gospel account.  Objectively the version done in the census would not have been practical.  And then there are the differences in the stories of Matthew and Luke.  In Matthew Joseph and Mary lived in a house in Jerusalem.   In Luke they were visiting town and stayed in a stable.  Also, Herod died 10 years before the census that Luke writes about.  Those are not accidental errors.  They are what fiction authors call \"plot points.\"",

They reject the traditional ascription to Mark the Evangelist, the companion of the Apostle Peter, which probably arose from the desire of early Christians to link the work to an authoritative figure, and believe it to be the work of an author working with various sources including collections of miracle stories, controversy stories, parables, and a passion narrative.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Mark\n\nLuke:  \"Most modern scholars agree that the main sources used for Luke were a), the Gospel of Mark, b), a hypothetical sayings collection called the Q source, and c), material found in no other gospels, often referred to as the L (for Luke) source. The author is anonymous; the traditional view that it was Luke the Evangelist, the companion of Paul, is still occasionally put forward, but the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Luke\n\nJohn:  \"John reached its final form around AD 90\u2013110, although it contains signs of origins dating back to AD 70 and possibly even earlier. Like the three other gospels, it is anonymous, although it identifies an unnamed \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" as the source of its traditions. It most likely arose within a \"Johannine community\", and \u2013 as it is closely related in style and content to the three Johannine epistles \u2013 most scholars treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, albeit not from the same author.\" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_John\n\nI am not a scholar, but Wikipedia is usually pretty reliable on the positions of a field of scholarship. I'm open to evidence that Wikipedia is incorrect about this, but not to one-off scholars who happen to disagree with the body of established work on the topic. \n\nIf the source of your belief is Bible publishers or seminary-trained ministers, well, those are not sources of rigorous scholarship, and Christians just straight up lie to themselves constantly about how reliable the Bible is as a source, who wrote it, etc.",

If you don't have any trouble asking hard questions about the reliability of the Book of Mormon, why not ask the same ones of the Bible? Surely you must know that not everyone assumes the Bible is true. Most don't.\n\nIf you think the Bible is perfect, [I have an exercise for you to try](https://ffrf.org/about/getting-acquainted/item/18418-leave-no-stone-unturned). Don't worry, it requires nothing but a little Bible study.\n\nI once believed as you did. I think things that are true and real, as I once believed the Bible was, can withstand a little scrutiny. Reality doesn't fold in on itself like a house of cards when you ask it hard questions and really test it. The goal isn't to prove something true; it's to fail to disprove it, and in the process figure out what is really real. But when I went to ask those questions of the Bible, it didn't hold up.\n\nYou can say it's perfect all you want, but there are [obvious and deep flaws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3g6mXLEKk) apparent to anyone who hasn't got their eyes closed and fingers in their ears. [Here's a map of Biblical contradictions](https://philb61.github.io/). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_consistency_of_the_Bible is a good overview, though. \n\nI always assumed\u2014or maybe was taught\u2014that, as his divine word, God would have been supernaturally guarding its copying and translations through the ages, but that turned not to be the case. Some of my favorite examples of ways in which the Bible was obviously mistranslated and miscopied are the [camel through the eye of a needle](https://stantlitore.com/2018/06/01/a-camel-through-the-eye-of-a-needle-and-other-wild-tales-of-translation/), the [\"virgin\" birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almah) (or [here if you don't trust Wikipedia](https://jewsforjesus.org/publications/issues/issues-v09-n01/almah-virgin-or-young-maiden/)), or even just the way that the \"shield of faith\" in the full armor of God should be translated \"shield of God's faithfulness\" (which is a way better shield, honestly\u2014for discussion of this mistranslation, see [this book](https://smile.amazon.com/Full-Armor-God-Defending-Schemes-ebook/dp/B00AHY0RNE?sa-no-redirect=1)). These are mistranslations that make substantive changes to the meaning of the text, upon which actual doctrines have been erected.\n\nWe know that scribes made errors while copying the Bible. [Printers certainly made errors when printing them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_errata)\u2014there are still a few copies of the Sinner's Bible, which printed the Seventh Commandment as \"Thou Shalt Commit Adultery.\" Obviously those are human errors, but God allowed them, so he isn't safeguarding the integrity of his word. We don't have the original manuscripts of the Bible, so we have no idea what God's word originally said, and apparently it's not that important to him.\n\nMore importantly, even if we assume what we have is an accurate copy of scripture, the Bible isn't clear in what it does say. [Biblical clarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarity_of_scripture) is a basic principle of Protestant hermaneutics. [Reality shows that for a lie, though](https://imgur.com/NZEuxQH). If the Bible was clear and unambiguous, there wouldn't be so many factions and denominations and sects, each claiming the only true interpretation of God's word.\n\nWe only have to look back 160 years to see a time when the abolition of slavery was championed by Christians on the basis of the Bible while Christian slave owners were justifying the practice using the very same book.\n\nEven what the Bible obviously and clearly means has changed over time. Such bedrocks of modern Christianity as [the idea of eternal damnation didn't enter common belief until after Augustine](https://medium.com/@BrazenChurch/how-when-the-idea-of-eternal-torment-invaded-church-doctrine-7610e6b70815), more than 500 years after Christ. And everyone since has been seeing the doctrine right there in the text.\n\nThe Bible is not perfect in its historical accounts. It contains numerous anachronisms, like camels existing in Egypt prior to the 300s BCE and Jericho having a wall or even being inhabited in the 13th century BCE. The [historicity of the Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_the_Bible) is far from what anyone would call perfect, but Christians are blissfully unaware.\n\nThe Bible is not perfect in its models and descriptions of the world. It contains numerous, verifiable scientific falsehoods, from heliocentrism to rabbits chewing their cud (Lev. 11:6) to demon possession being the cause of epilepsy to a [global flood which is found nowhere in the geological record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative#Historicity) and is disproven by facts as indisputable as the existence of marsupials in and only in Australia and the existence of all life after a salt bath that would have killed all terrestrial plant life. Heck, we have Chinese written records and living trees older than the supposed flood.\n\nThe Bible is not perfect in its moral standards. We can morally surpass the Bible with moral basics like \"maybe gay people don't all deserve to die\" or \"slavery is always wrong.\" You can't improve upon perfect, so the Bible isn't morally perfect.\n\n[So what value is there left in the Bible then?](https://www.readthesequences.com/Religions-Claim-To-Be-Non-Disprovable)",

Professor goes through it with an academic point of view and explains the mythology of early Israel. Basically Yahweh's original name was \"El\" (hence why most jewish names end in \"el\" - daniEL) and was a part of the Akkadian, Canaanite, Babylonian pantheon (which is why fellow god Ba'al is mentioned in the bible too) and explains how El became Yahweh and early Israelites became henotheistic (believes in many gods, but favors one). Also explains overlapping folktales in the area (flood, samson goliath, hulk samson, etc). And then finishes with the prophets - how they dated, history in prophecies went wrong, etc.\n\n[Yale uploaded the New Testament courses on youtube too](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtQ2TS1CiDY&list=PL279CFA55C51E75E0). Professor explains how bible was put together. Goes over the contradictions and why they exist. He explains many of the books claimed to be written by Paul were not actually written by paul, writers just used his name. The resurrection wasn't original, it was added much later and some old bibles have it as extra bit at the end of the gospel. Explains how Christian twisted some old testament prophecy to fit jesus as the messiah, but in reality it was referring to other person in the OT. Etc\n\nhighly recommend watching them, the classes answered so many questions and give info that most people dont know",

Possible, I say. All the other nonsense in the bible is just that, nonsense.\nSpiderman's plot - boy gets bit by a spider and transforms itself into a spider. And he saves many people' lives from his nemesis, The Green Goblin (one of the many) that apparently, for some reason, hated the spider guy. Totally fantastic.

Tacitus mentioning Chistus (which means messiah in Greek, a title of which there were many claimants at that time) does not mean that Tacitus believed these accounts anymore than the dialog attributed to Jesus is meant to imply Greek mythology.\n\nAnd since you glossed over the main point, I'll restate it. Being mentioned as an aside to explain why crazy people are crazy is not the same as being the subject of history. IF Jesus existed, and advocated for a Marxist-style overthrow by the proletariat, did magic, and inspired people, we would have a historical record of those actions, not oblique references that justify behavior of others decades later, or pure falsehoods inserted by the Catholic church (e.g. Josephus).",

We have no evidence.  Especially when everything from the Exodus to the Flood to the existence of Moses has been pretty concretely debunked? Why would we just accept it on \"faith\"?

I say this because that's the general consensus of what historians say. Am I a historian? No. But I tend to defer to them as I have no intention of devoting years of my life studying it. Saying you know definitively there was no Jesus is a blind faith argument as much as saying there was.\n\nI recommend looking at r/AcademicBiblical if you're interested in the evidence for and against, as this comes up a lot.",

In fact, your \"argument from insignificance\" is an astonishly easy argument to disprove. From Julius Caesar to Pontias Pilate to even common criminals, there are third party contemporaneous accounts for all of these people -- including execution warrants, for example. \n\nBut there's NONE for the so-called miracle worker who supposedly founded a cult that exists even to this day. Not for decades after he was supposedly long gone in the best of estimates. Ahem.\n\nNote that even the VATICAN makes no such claims (since the advent of carbon dating, mind you), only that everything regarding Jesus must be taken \"as a matter of faith\".\n\nDo you honestly think that if the VATICAN had a shred of evidence that would hold up to any credible testing whatsoever that they wouldn't trumpet this from pulpits worldwide...as the passed the gilded collection plates for cash?!\n\n>Leonidas and the 300 have no contemporary evidence.\n\nLikewise utterly incorrect. Ignoring the obvious false equivalency here (see below), the Battle of Thermopylae is attested to by numerous sources which we have accounts of by their latter day translators. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Thermopylae#Sources\n\nWe even have physical evidence to support the credibility of Herodotus's account:\n\n\"Archaeological evidence, such as the Serpent Column (now in the Hippodrome of Constantinople), also supports some of Herodotus' specific reports\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpent_Column\n\nWhile the facts have become highly fictionalized in legend, of course, there can be no doubt that a battle was fought and therefore was not a myth cut from whole cloth, like the life of Jesus of Nazareth appears to be.\n\nAnd Leonidas is well-established in history by his father's lineage, etc. by people who took records of this sort of thing VERY seriously. Again, the real man has become a legend so it's hard to separate fact from fiction.\n\nThe same goes for Scipio Africanus, who was a known general, attested to across multiple sources including those he battled from other lands, etc. Again, there is no reason to doubt the stories (even fictionalized ones) were based on a real man.\n\nUnlike, again, Jesus...for which there is literally nothing at all.\n\nAnd finally, who cares about these others? You've presented a false equivalency here as if it matters to the world if either of these leaders were real or not. It doesn't. Historians make the best guess with piss poor evidence they can...but it doesn't ultimately matter whether their guess is right, does it?\n\nCan you say the same for a billion ignorant, gullible christians or the charlatans that bilk them daily around the world regarding Jesus?",

I'm right there. I'll look for his book (I haven't read it). Even if I were 100% sure there was no historical jesus, I think it's a silly place to argue with christians. My point keeps being that unlikely, not unlikely, it doesn't matter, since non-magic jesus is such a mundane claim. I can grant that as plausible and move on. The problem is, and the thing I want to talk about with them, is that they want to smuggle in magic jesus on top of mundane claim jesus. Historians aren't even trying to prove miracles happened, and they want to pretend like they are. Any non magic jesus is uninteresting. \n\n>Garbage Pail Mike would probably be well over 95%.\n\nI'm a personal witness of Garbage Pail Mike, if that helps.",

As such, they are going by their \"feels\" or baseless assumptions, which is not good science.\n\nNote that those same scholars, christian and otherwise, thought the story of Exodus was based on real events. A little over 40 years ago that was proven to be completely and utterly false. The Jews were NEVER enslaved en masse in Egypt and therefore the entire tale is now referred to, even by Jewish (non-Orthodox kooks) scholars are a \"founding myth\"...not historical truth.\n\nWhich also means that Moses is an imaginary character.

You are mistaken possibility for probability. Right now, based on the evidence and all factors, the probability that the fictional character of Jesus from the christian mythological work called the bible is precisely ZERO.\n\nFor people who subscribe to wishful thinking, the lies they were told as children, or the scams they rely on for money, they will claim a possibility based on the notes you present.\n\nWe know Joseph Smith was a real person.

Throughout history, ALL religions have been formed by either someone lying (a charlatan) or a mentally ill person unable to understand the breaking down of their mind (aka most likely paranoid schizophrenia). \n\nSince none of them have ever been proven to be the least bit true, ALL OF THE EVIDENCE since the dawn of time shows that all religions are the purest of bunk. That is the most likely and most common Occam's razor here -- some criminal or kook lied for money, power, or sexual favors...again.\n\nWe even have numberous recent examples. From Joseph Smith's Angel Moroni to L. Ron Hubbard's Xenu, it's the easiest path to profit for these charlatans to create an imaginary lord and messiah while placing themselves in the position to profit as that lord and messiah's sole messenger (usually through ye old \"I dreamed I talked to god/Jesus/Xenu last night\" trope).\n\nIn fact, if you look at the history of christianity, it is FAR more likely that Paul is one of (if not the) original christian charlatan of record here. He's the one who is obviously lying right from the get go (I met Jesus \"via revelation\", aka a dream, ahem) and using proven scam techniques that were thousands of years old when he pulled the same old wool over people's eyes.\n\nI think the case is much stronger that Paul, Joseph Smith, and L. Ron Hubbard are much more alike here than dissimilar. And we know for a fact that all three of these men were scamming people with their bogus claims.\n\n\nAnd in all of these case",

He was buried in a tomb and after three days rose again. His followers celebrated this event each year at the time of resurrection (and this date later became \u201cEaster\u201d).

He claimed he got all of his Jesus juice \"via revelation\" -- as in a dream. Ahem. This makes Paul either mentally ill or a liar and a fraud. Given that he seems to write a lot of this bullshit very coherently and uses many of the oldest charlatan prophet tricks known for thousands of years even in his day, I think the weight of the evidence shows that he was a liar and a fraud like Joseph Smith or L.

But given that we KNOW FOR A FACT NOW that Josephus' body of work has been definitively and beyond a shadow of a doubt TAMPERED WITH (by presumably christian monks) to install Jesus and his ridiculous plagiarized story into the historical record (that christian monks controlled, ahem), then we must assume that all of Josephus's mentions of \"Jesus\" have been tampered with by default. \n\nIn short, we have proof they've been tampered with. And therefore can no longer take them as actual evidence in regards to the fictional Jesus found in christian mythology.\n\nThat's actually how real world evidence works. We know it has been corrupted by the claimants. Therefore, we can't use it in our inquiries. \n\n>The use of those literary techniques ...snip...\n\nWhat a bunch of irrelevant goalpost moving apologist bullshit.

          "text": "TL;DR Why would people write about someone they don\u2019t care about who to the society of the time was some fringe nobody. Jesus rabble roused and was executed. Some followers claimed He was resurrected but clearly they are crazy so case closed. Jesus and His movement simply didn\u2019t have the cultural weight that exists now so it\u2019s wrong to assume that it did and apply the same standards of importance of today to back then. Maybe He made a small splash in Judea at the time but He was killed and what little of non-believing society that cared moved on.\n\nSee my ramble below for more.\n\nWhy would they have written anything about Him during His time? To Jesus\u2019 contemporaries He was just another no name rabble rouser to be written off? Would you dedicate very many resources in your diary to someone who essentially means nothing to you or was just an annoyance? Maybe one line if you had a personal encounter, \u201csome guy claimed he was the Son of God today. Hm\u2026crazy. Anyways\u2026\u201d The Jewish leaders rejected Him so why would they dedicate very much if any writing to Him? Certainly not enough to maintain a secular historical record of Jesus. Safe assumption to say they thought He was a crazy nobody and just wanted Him to fade into obscurity. The Roman authorities thought He was a political threat at best and even then He was executed so as far as they were concerned: \u201cthree criminals executed today\u201d maybe they note they marked One as King of the Jews but that\u2019s not going to be any record that would be likely to survive. So to Jesus\u2019 immediate contemporaries He was barely a footnote. The only people that would care at the time would be those whose lives were affected by knowing Him and it makes sense that people don\u2019t start writing about Him until later and even then just in the context of \u201coh there\u2019s this group people call Christians who follow this Christ guy\u201d at best. With the miraculous occurrences you run into skepticism and apathy. Plenty of people did not believe even with miracles occurring and in at least one story Jesus heals like 5 blind guys and only one comes back. Even after a miracle clearly people might go thanks, and then go on with their lives as if nothing happened. During His time Jesus was like a hometown hero traveling around and then towards the end, a fringe political threat that, to the Roman authorities view, was adequately put down.\n\nThe mistake made here is thinking that since Jesus and Christianity etc. is so big today and has a huge cultural influence then surely it was the same back then and people would have taken more notice and more should have been written about it all. But that\u2019s just not the case. Jesus was a nobody except to those who knew Him and followed Him, and the people that knew Him and followed Him were just followers of yet another religion in the empire at best and crazies to be killed for being unwilling to sacrifice to the Roman gods at worst so, not worth paying attention to from the perspective of the culture or at least not enough to be obsessing over and writing gobs about wouldn\u2019t you think? Makes sense that not very many contemporary secular accounts survive because no one really cared about the little Jesus movement even in Judea and bigger more widespread published/copied historians aren\u2019t going to devote any time and writing to a nothingburger.",

I imagine that  the canon agreed on at Hippo would've been colored by the fact that they were now the official religion of the Roman Empire so the more pro-Roman versions might have rung truer to their ears.",

They further include their own litterature that might be original or copies of additional sources named \"source M\" for Matthew and \"source L\" for Luke.\n\nWhile the synoptic gospels present Jesus as a human messenger of God, John presents him as a litteral incarnation of God (similar to an hindu Avatar in a way) and goes a long way to contradict the synoptic gospels as often as possible. It possibly reflect a change of paradigm between the early christian jews in Judea and Anatolia, and the later christians in Rome.\n\nNote that there is many other gospels, that we have fragments of, that reflect the numerous beliefs of the christian jews' sects in the first century ; some, like Thomas' gospel of the infancy, talk about Jesus' infancy (during which he was an asshole using his divine powers for the lulz) ; other, like the gnostic gospel of Judas, portray the abrahamic god as an evil usurper that Jesus fight and Judas as the only believer in Jesus' true teaching that was betrayed by the other disciples.\n\nThe Injil (one of Islam divine books with the Tawrat (the Torah of Pentateuch), the Zabur (a part of the Psalms, and the holy book of David according to the islamic faith) and the Quran) is another gospel, probably from some of the unsuccessful christian jewish sects.

They will simply assume you are lying because they were never taught this. \n\nAnother contributing factor is that the holder of most of the first source evidence on this topic is the archives of the catholic church,  which have historically been untrusted by protestants.

For example, there is some historical description of the first Jewish-Roman war, for which there are corroborating documents from the Roman side. This suggests that the first gospel was written after 70AD.  \n\nIt is *conceivable,* if not likely, that some of the apostles could still be alive in their 80s or 90s if they had been in their twenties or younger at the time they were apostles. So even at the late date of 70AD it is *possible* that the gospels could have been transcribed by people talking to the apostles.\n\nOf course, theologians insist that these were prophecies that prove Jesus was able to predict the future and therefore it could have been written earlier, which begs the question. \n\n*If you believe the gospels were accurate then Jesus was a prophet. They could have been written earlier because Jesus was a prophet. So you should believe the gospels were accurate because they were written earlier. So you can also believe that Jesus was a prophet. So they could have been written earlier ... and round and round it goes*.",

Even the existence of some of these authors is up for debate, let alone their exact identity. In the cases where we know the person probably existed, even if they didn't write the book of the Bible attributed to them, very little is known about their life.\n\nAssuming that Jesus and the disciples actually existed, it's likely that *some* of the disciples at least spoke Greek and a few were literate. Koine Greek served as a lingua franca during the period in which Jesus is said to have lived, and many of the disciples were merchants of some kind and would likely have known some Greek to do business. Jesus is said to have associated with tax collectors - who were more like civil servants at the time, executing contracts and handling other public works, and were definitely literate.\n\n[Mark the Evangelist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_the_Evangelist), said to be a contemporary of Jesus (lived from about 12-68 AD). Not much is known about his life, including whether or not he was illiterate. He's said to have established some churches in North Africa and contributed to the Coptic liturgy. If that's true, he was probably literate, but there's no way to verify any of that.\n\nMatthew was civil servant and tax collector, so he would've had to be able to read and write Greek. Luke was, supposedly, a physician, so it's plausible that he was literate as well.\n\nChristians can't really agree which John wrote the Book of John. John of Patmos was obviously literate, as he wrote the book of Revelation. We've got no knowledge of John the Apostle's literacy and John the Presbyter's very existence is doubted.\n\nBut yeah, more realistically none of these people actually wrote their books of the Bible; it's probably all just oral tradition that several people decided to write down and eventually someone(s) combined into a book.",

We often say that ancient works have been handed down to us. Does that suggest that our contemporaries interviewed Plato or Aristotle? Hardly.\n\n2 Peter is an epistle, not a gospel. it was written in the 2nd century, and most biblical scholars consider it to be pseudepigraphical, that is, written under a pseudonym by someone claiming to be Peter. \n\nBoth John and Paul claimed to have \"observed his glory,\" neither claimed to have  known the historical Jesus. (The Johannian gospel was written at the end of the 1st century.)\n\nAsserting that testimony is true does not make it so.\n\nPaul wrote no gospels. He maintained that he received his \"gospel\" - his teachings - from the risen Christ, pointedly denying learning about Jesus' teachings from anyone,  including  James, Peter and John,  said by the gospel authors (70-100 CE) to have been eyewitnesses to the historical Jesus. \n\nSee Galatians 1:11-12, \"For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel. For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it from a revelation of Jesus Christ.\"\n\nAlthough Paul said he met James, Peter and John, he did not identify them as having been Jesus' companions during his earthly ministry in Galilee and Jerusalem.\n\nThe vision by \"over 500 brothers and sisters\" was of the risen Christ, not of the human Jesus.\n\nI stand by my statement that no gospel author claimed to have interviewed an eyewitness to the words and deeds of Jesus.",

That was in 1707!!! According to Bart Ehrman, who is the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, there are now 200,000 to 400,000 textual discrepancies among 5,700 Greek and 10,000 Latin manuscripts. Christians I've discussed this with would have you believe they are insignificant, but they are not. Some surely are, like a misspelled or miscopied word, but many of the variants appear to be pushing the religious agenda of the writer. You definitely should check out Bart Ehrman's work. He lays it all out in a very unbiased way. And he's damn good. He is head of the religious studies department at one fof the biggest seminary schools in America as an agnostic. I can not be 100% certain that there is no \"higher power\" of some kind, but thanks to my personal study of the New and Old Testaments I can certainly say that it's 100% not Yeshua or Yahweh.\n\nEdit: \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mill_(theologian)\n\nhttps://youtube.com/c/bartdehrman",

It doesn't matter if 'God spoke to me and told me what to write' because the gospels included in the Bible weren't written by people who claimed that God spoke to them.  All of the gospels in the Bible have overlapping facts, whether those be locations, dates, names or events that are mentioned in other books, despite the authors never having met each other.  When you select a few books that have enough points in common, it's accepted that those books were written by people who heard accurate accounts of the teachings of Jesus.  It's never been claimed that the Bible was written by people who actually met Jesus.  The books were written forms of stories passed down for ages.  They have enough points in common to be accepted as historically valid. Lots and lots of books were rejected from inclusion into the Bible because they didn't have verifiable facts in them.",

A good example was mentioned earlier. No one thought Jesus was from Bethlehem until 90 AD. Then two different groups made up a story about it but disagree in ways that expose the fraud. A better question is why was this added to the story when the 'grand-children' are now telling the story. To better compete with the religions of the day, of course.

Paul's letters are earlier, 20 years or even less after Jesus' death.\n\nSome Christians will be shaken when they hear stuff like this the first time.  But they are pretty good at either rejecting the new info or incorporating and adapting to it while hanging onto their major beliefs.\n\nJohn (in 21:24) seems to claim to be an eyewitness, but Luke (in 1:1-4) clearly places himself as someone receiving this stuff second hand at best and trying to discern and organize the best version. He also claims he traveled with Paul, who met with major eyewitnesses.  The other canonical gospels don't make a claim iirc but share a lot of content with Luke.   Basically John is either lying or very old and the rest are third hand received through oral tradition or older non surviving written stuff.  \n\nYou'd really think there would have to be other written stuff given the state of the church described by Paul and the amount he was writing and the topics he was not touching - he really doesn't cover basic tenets, he tends to charitable appeals, church management, and kinda dense theology. People had to be getting the basic story and conclusions somewhere, either other writings or tons of oral transmission.\n\n(Edited.)",

Of course no one knows, as it is set in like England a generation ago and no one has ever been there or alive from that time,  so it could be true, but considering all that magical non-sense it is probably not.   \n\nFunny how JC's birthday just happens to be on the darkest day in the northern hemisphere or close enough for the reckoning of the time, and how his death is in the spring, and these dates are pretty close to days that were already being celebrated.    There's just a bunch of stuff there that works out so conveniently like it was a novel,    Or maybe that was God's plan and they made it that way, and that is why JC is so cool.      \n\n\nThere are no direct accounts of the Buddha either. Buddha was a bit before JC, and it could just be that folks didn't write stuff down as much back then.    \n\nMohamed had/has some kids floating around.   Joe Smith and L. Ron Hubbard had a bunch of folks that might remember them directly but with that closer history they have less credence, unless it is that those stories need to age a bit more.  \n\nThere seems to be an aging process to a religion.    Is Islam where Christianity was 500 years ago?   Is Christianity going to look like Buddhism in 500 years?",

Unless you were educated enough to have been taught Latin the general parishioners had to rely on their priest to translate everything for them. \n\nWe won\u2019t go into the Catholic church\u2019s greed. \n\nMy turning point was knowledge and just the fact the Bible is written by man. Man is a fallible being and nothing can be taken literally because half of it is likely wrong. If anything in the Bible is correct it is the lessons that some of the stories tell. I say some here on purpose. \n\nSo the Bible is a book of stories written by men that heard stories handed down by however many generations. Men are fallible. Some people are all about power and control. Religion provides a means of pacifying the masses thus providing these men power and control over huge swathes of people. A threat of not following their teachings will send you to hell (a man made construct never mentioned in the Bible or was that the devil). So on and so forth. \n\nOnly the curious read the Bible anymore except scholars and the curious. \n\nMaybe there is another post that discusses this, but isn\u2019t it amazing how there is a Jesus like person in every major religion?  Yet, religious wars are fought because their \u201cJesus\u201d is the best \u201cJesus.\u201d",

Humans are so easily tricked into believing anything that many fail to realize the Bible wasn't written by anyone they know, in any language they could possibly understand, and that their version is a translation, of a translation, of a translation, of a translated spoken word of a translated cave drawing.

It was like lifting a veil from my eyes. 35 years later  I have so much more inner peace and a rational understanding of the world. Rather than a cure for evil, I have come to realize that religion is ironically at the root of most evil.",

      "text": "It depends on what you consider to be \"the bible\".  \n\nTalking about the new testament, there are four distinct sections.   Understanding the structure is important.  \n\n* The Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) - These are the accounts of Jesus's life and teaching, taking place between 4 BC and 30 or 33 AD.  The Gospel of Mark probably dates from AD 66\u201370, Matthew and Luke around AD 85\u201390, and John AD 90\u2013110.  There is lots of overlap between Mathew Mark, and Luke (specific text-wise, not events), and scholars know there was some cribbing, but argue about who plagiarized who.  With Mark, however, being written as early as 30 years after the death of Jesus, it's quite possible the author met Jesus.  Moreover, there are written references to earlier texts and proto-gospels, so it's likely these are not the original forms.  \n\n\n* Acts I and II - these are the acts of the apostles, Taking place 30 or 33 AD through the next 30 years.  Mostly as a sequel.  These are considered to be written 60 or so years after the death of Jesus.\n\n* The Epistles - These are letters written from the apostles to various church leaders, often discussing theology, church organization, or simply just words of encouragement for the fledgling churches.  Mostly written by Paul, contemporaneously with Acts.    \n\n*   Revelations - Very last of the books, and not a long one.  The prophecies of John of Patmos about the end of days.  Dated to about 95 AD.  Nobody understands what this actual says, and if you hear crazy biblical end of days stuff, dragons with five heads and 7 horns with whores on them, it comes from this.  Interesting, but ultimately contains no theology.  \n\nThis does not include the other books of the bible that didn't make the final cut, including the Shepherd of Hermas, and apocryphia.",

So an elderly man is with a child and she gives birth in a barn and strange men come give gifts. Cause of course it's a miracle of god impregnating her as no elderly 80 plus year old man would rape a child and then have her birth in a pile of hay right?  So Jesus grows up with his mom always worried about him telling him soMe crazy stories of oh that's not your real dad - your real dad cares about you and won't let anything happen to you. \n\nThen dude basically has to keep fleeing prosecution, starts going quite manic and believing and convincing others he can walk on water and make wine and people can eat his body. \n\nHe befriends all the riff raff cause who else is gonna hang out with someone while they are wiling out. \n\nThen if god exists he's like oh - now you wanna do all this crazy stuff? Ok well you're sinning around being all high and mighty. Well then you can just die for everyone else's sins then buddy boy hot shot show off. And then let's jesus get crucified. \n\nOr on the flip side - ain't no god and jesus thinks he's gonna survive being tied to a stake. Which is even more bonkers. \n\nOr an even weirder third thing - he faked people out and it's a dude who never was tied to a stake and just came out of a cave and convinced everyone he survived death. \n\nAnyway after you pick your adventure from the last three. Jesus he hops out the cave and dies again. But watch out when he comes backs. Third time he's gonna end you with his vengeance for having died for your sins \n\nEven though he died for all\nOf your sins - he's still gonna come smite anyone who has sinned and be nice only to people who sin but also believe he died for their sins. So sin you want to your devious heart desire and just say praise Jesus and all is good and everyone who doesn't believe can just rot\n\nSo jesus basically becomes his own abusive dad in the end... just to everyone.",

What happened to the others you say? They were destroyed by the followers of the disciples who disagreed with each others accounts. So keep in mind that today's bible exists because the followers of 3 disciples murdered the followers of the other 9 disciples and destroyed 3 quarters of the original story and only kept the bits they agreed with.\n\nWe know about this from the Dead Sea Scrolls which were hidden at this time for safe keeping. Its also where we get the 2 most recent additions to the bible, psalms and proverbs.

In Seminary and such places, they are taught how to write a sermon.  How to construct the argument, you, the preacher/pastor or what have you, by outlining your topic, say Love, and then cherry-picking verses which agree with the position that particular pastor wants to put forward.\n\nEvery verse is used out of its original context and used to justify the context of the sermon that pastor wrote. In this fashion the same Bible is used for and against gay rights, women's rights, abortion rights, even slavery.  The Bible has been used in such fashion by RELIGIOUS LEADERS to justify wars, torture, and multiple genocides.",

That's enough for me tbh.\n\nBut no pastor talks about that. Maybe Jesus made various claims to being the Messiah in a Trumpian way, or like that Ukrainian in Florida who claimed to be a Rothschild -- a sort of \"lie enough and people will believe you\" situation.\n\nOof.",

The Romans crucified exclusively for treason against the Roman state.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Paul, marketing his unique twist on Judaism to the Romans, very conveniently omitted any anti-Roman teachings which were likely pretty much exclusively what Jesus preached about during his life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPaul was the father of Christianity, not Jesus.  He was either a crazy person or a master manipulator (maybe both).  Paul's previous job was being a Jewish tax collector for Rome, he seemed to apply his job knowledge towards the founding of a religion.",

Scholars wrote different versions of the stories that did make it into The Bible, and there were a lot more religious texts out there that didn't make the final cut.  The name itself is a pretty clear indicator.  The most popular version of The Bible is the \"King James Version\" which is in and of itself a translation.  Translations are not perfect.  Some words have different meanings, some words are complicated and simplified, and some words don't even have a proper meaning in the translated version, so they do the best they can.\n\nJust look at this list of books that didn't make it:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Books_of_the_Bible_and_the_Forgotten_Books_of_Eden\n\nAnd also:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Gnostic_texts\n\nThere were a lot of people writing stuff based on the stories that were being told about Jesus.  It would be like being told you need to put together a book based on a historical figure, and all you have to go on is hundreds of texts about various stories involving that figure.  You'd research, gather all the stories that are out there, and compile everything into something that's cohesive.  A lot would be left out.  Some would be too outlandish.  Some would be crazy.  Some would go against the belief most have about the figure.  You'd have to cull down what fits your narrative, and that would be your final version.  Now imagine it continues to get dissected, edited, changed, and eventually translated into pretty much every language in the world.",

For Example, if Spider Man is thought to be a historical figure, but you find out Peter Parker had no super powers, does that mean spider man really existed?\n\nTo me its a problem of identity similar the ship of thessius.  How many planks must you remove from the ship of thessius before its no longer a functional ship?  How many traits must you strip away from the Biblical Jesus before \"historical Jesus\" is so far removed from Biblical Jesus that calling them the same thing is meaningless?\n\nThe \"Jesus was a historical figure\" take to me always seemed weak, bordering on an argument from ignorance fallacy.  \"Something must have caused the Christian faith to explode onto the historical scene, and I don't know how that's possible without a historical Jesus to get the ball rolling.\"  While I get that historians have to grant leeway to historical figures since it's hard to say anything definitive about any historical figure from antiquity, there's no major religion built around the supernatural deeds of Alexander the Great or Ceaser.  Christians read headlines like \"Historians agree there was a historical Jesus\" and ignore the rest, taking a leap of logic from that headline to \"Jesus in the Bible is 100% real, confirmed by historians.\"  If more emphasis was put on the differences between a historical Jesus and Biblical Jesus, I'd have less problems with this.  \"Historians believe Jesus probably existed, but he wasn't a God and didn't do any miracles or rose from the dead\" is more precise and takes the wind out of bad Christian takes.",

Of the NT writers, we don't actually know for sure, but as far as we can tell based on the evidence available, the writers likely didn't know Jesus personally. Paul almost certainly didn't.\n\n>How has this not come up in every religious debate? I'm just finding out about this out now?\n\nWhy *would* it come up in every religious debate? Did you think all of the Bible's writers personally met Jesus?\n\nThis isn't really the coup you seem to be treating it as.\n\n>I was under the impression that all the gospels were written by Jesus's disciples.\n\nNo, I think that cat has been out of the bag for quite a while. Many Bibles themselves will state in small introductory notes that the gospels are \"traditionally attributed\" or named after the disciples / apostles, but the actual authors are mostly unknown.\n\n>But instead I find out: Writers of bible never met Jesus when he was alive. / It was written 60-100 years after Jesus died / No eyewitness accounts in the bible\n\nWell...I wouldn't say there are no eyewitness accounts of *anything* in the Bible. But as far as we know, there are no first-person accounts of people who met Jesus in it.\n\n>How is this not in the opening statement during every theology debate?\n\nAgain...this isn't a new discovery or all that shocking. A *lot* of things we \"know\" about the past were passed along to us by people who heard about them from other people. The stories in the Bible are not exceptional in that regard. Reliable first-person accounts are amazing when we get them, but they're also fairly rare, especially when you're talking about events that supposedly happened 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe reason it isn't the opening statement during every \"theology debate\" might be because it would make the person making that statement seem silly and naive, since any serious person involved in such a debate would presumably have already known this for quite a while.\n\nThere are specific debates / topics where this fact is relevant, but I don't think it's the defeater you seem to think it is.",

If there is no Jesus, then there is no resurrection. Both are necessary contingencies. This is the reason why those two topics are hotly debated in academia, as opposed to what you mention in your last sentence.\n\nWhether Jesus healed the blind, fed over 5000 people, was born from a virgin mother, (parting the sea and Noah's ark are part of the old testament and not a part of the gospels), etc., all of that can be false yet that wouldn't invalidate the claim that Jesus was the son of god...perhaps a crappy one, but still god the son.\n\nAnd you might be correct. I don't think that if Jesus was 100%, unmistakenly proven to be fiction, sending the veracity of the religion into question, people wouldn't stop believing on it...at least not immediately. This would necessarily be a generational change.",

There is a huge difference in believing an unknowable force guides your fate and \"believing in\"/understanding electromagnetic radiation, which we may not be able to see, but can perceive, measure, and generate by use of tools. \n\nLets go with your idea that religion is \"a way of looking at the world through which we simply cannot understand until the advent of certain ideals.\" A lot of religions have been discarded. No one really believes in Zeus and the pantheon of gods anymore. They were discarded. Some religions squeezed others out, by force in the case of Christianity often.  Other religions have evolved with the new understanding of the world. For example, read up on the churches stance on geocentrism vs heliocentrism. \n\nI totally agree that people were just as intelligent back then as we are know. They created some absolute marvels, but they did not have the same level of knowledge that we have now. For example, the old testament provides instructions for farmers to rotate their crops, rest their fields every few years, and have wind breaks. It doesn't explain that there are nutrients in the soil and what each of those are, which we are capable of doing now. These days we mostly ignore those portions of the bible because it isn't really relevant to most christians. Though it is still pretty good advice, it is more limited than what you can learn in an agriculture class these days. \n\nTo me, that signifies we have a need to understand our universe. When faced with a lack of knowledge or ability to find that understanding, some people turn to religion to fill in the gaps. Assuming you live in a world without an established religion and you choose the latter path, you have to make up your own ideas about who god is and what it does. Eventually, you are probably going to make up some stories to go along with those ideas. Example: from wikipedia, \"Apollo divides months into summer and winter. He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans during the winter months, and the absence of warmth in winters is due to his departure.\" You tell two friends, and they think your story makes as much sense as anything else and decide to believe that too. They tell two friends, and so on and so forth. Eventually, someone writes it down. Now you have a bible and ~2000 years later someone idiots on the internet debate your intelligence.",

We actually do have contemporary first-hand witness inscriptions from his generals, as well as documents from historians after his death. We even have contemporary external references to Alexander by other cultures. We have none of that for Jesus...the closest we have is historians documenting what some people in some region believed.\n\nJesus could have been a real person, an amalgamation of different itinerant rabbi, or even the personification of the cultural beliefs from a group of rabbi. But for the sake of being practical, I believe he could have been a single person. But that my initial point was that christianity hinges on those two points I mentioned, and if we can't even demonstrate the historicity of Jesus, a much more mundane fact, then how can we demonstrate the veracity of the resurrection?",

      "text": "Well, while there are many issues with the bible from a modern or academic perspective (e.g., the synoptic problem, the contradictions between Paul's epistles and the book of Acts, the multiple times that God creates the earth in Genesis, the fact that Bible is pretty clear that pre-exile Israel was polytheistic and God originally had a wife, *etc*.).  But regarding the points you listed in particular, my guess is that those specific points you raise never come up because they are actually wrong.\n\nJesus is generally dated to have died between 30 and 33 AD.  Yes, there's a lot of \"debate\" about whether Jesus was the son of God.  But there's generally very little secular, academic debate that a millenialist preacher with a following of disciples named Jesus was active in the second temple period in Jerusalem and died around 30-33 AD.  Meanwhile, the earliest of Paul's epistles (Galatians) is dated to \\~ 48 AD (with his conversion having occurred sometime before) and the earliest of the Gospels (Mark) is dated to \\~65 to 70 AD.  \n\nSo while Paul never claimed to have met the living Jesus (see Damascus Road Conversion) and the Gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke are anonymous (authorship is ascribed by tradition), it's entirely possible that Paul's contemporaries in Jerusalem had met and/or known Jesus.  It's also possible that the author of at least Mark knew Jesus when the author was a younger man or woman (e.g., if \"Mark\" was 20 at the time of Jesus's death, Mark would be 50-60 at the time the Gospel of Mark was authored).  \n\nGiven the timelines, it's entirely plausible that the author of at least Mark was an eye-witness to the events of Jesus's life and ministry, but that his or her account was not written down until later.  Mark's accounts may be fantastical, and barely credible, but that dates line up that the author of Mark could have been an eyewitness.\n\nAs I said, there are lots of problems with the Bible, many of which should be brought up and addressed in an intelligent conversation.  However, the ones you listed are not really among them.",

I agree that the scholarly consensus leans to be second or third hand accounts, but it\u2019s not as crazy a stretch to think that John was the author. The other gospels are significantly harder to prove authorship. \n\nhttps://zondervanacademic.com/blog/who-wrote-gospels\n\nThis article attempts to provide arguments for both sides of authorship for each of the gospels and concludes that they are still anonymous. I have doubts about the source (some Christian scholar \u201cschool\u201d) and it definitely biases a bit towards authorship, but at least provides some historical context and actual interpretation of the original Greek/Aramaic/Hebrew texts. \n\nI was essentially raised in a fundamentalist cult and now am just trying to figure out what I believe after so much indoctrination.

But much of the bible was written either directly by the apostles or a scribe writing on behalf of the apostle. These first scripts would have likely been translated from spoken Hebrew to written Greek. So already there are some translation issues right there. After that you have to think for the western Roman empire it would have been translated into Latin. And then from there you have to consider that from this Latin it would then be translated into the local dialects. And everywhere Christianity went in those early days, new converts always tried to add local customs and beliefs. All of this over centuries, with each person translating it potentially (intentional or not) adding in their own interpretations, beliefs, values, or motives into the text. So even though most of it was \"written\" by the original apostles there is no doubt that what we have today is far muddled from the original.",

      "text": "My favorite bit of bible trivia is what the original christians most likely meant by \u201cson of Hashem\u201d (god).\n\nIt was fairly common for roman emperors to adopt virtuous young men as their sons. These adopted sons were considered more valuable than natural-born sons, because an adopted son had to be someone of great merit, while a natural-born son was just lucky. \n\nThe roman senate was also in the habit of posthumously deifying popular emperors. When one died, they would take a vote and if the yays outnumbered the nays, the dead emperor had been adopted into godhood by Zeus or Apollo or whoever. Thereby becoming a son of that god. \n\nAnd there are clues in the bible that the first christians believed that Jesus was *adopted* by Hashem at some intermediate point. For example if you compare Jesus\u2019 baptism between gospels, some of them have a voice say \u201cthis is my belived son\u201d, as if Hashem is merely making public a father-son relationship that already existed. But other gospels \u2014 including Mark, the earliest-written one \u2014 has the voice say \u201cyou are my beloved son,\u201d as if Hashem is talking only to Jesus in order to establish a *new* relationship right then and there.\n\nSo it seems like the earliest christians believed that Jesus was adopted by Hashem upon death. This quickly changed to \u2018upon baptism,\u2019 then \u2018upon birth,\u2019 and then finally to \u2018natural-born son and coeternal deity.\u2019",

This was an apocalyptic event and must have prompted a lot of soul searching about how god let it happen. So it seems extremely plausible to me that dissident Jews would blame the same people whom Jesus criticizes in the Gospels (Pharisees, etc), and seek a new path. And how better to argue your position than to tell a story that is cobbled together from Old Testament prophecy featuring a messiah who predicted what would happen 40-50 years ago.",

For those not willing to watch an 18 minutes video (seriously, it's worth watching), the short version is that we have just a few tiny fragments of short text from the second century, an [almost complete copy of John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papyrus_66) (a.k.a. the one **not** part of the synoptic gospels\\*) that *might* be from the 3rd century but is more likely 4th century, and finally [a complete version of Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Vaticanus) produced in middle of the 4th century.\n\n\\* This is something I feel is really overlooked by many is just how different John is from Mark and the two gospels based on Mark.  Besides not having the birth narrative and containing [different at best and contradictory at worst events narrative](http://www.para-gospel.com/full).",

Not in the sense that he was the actual author, but in that the author states that they are relaying what was told to them by John. So it would be secondhand at best, but with more of a direct connection than anything else by far, should you put any stock into such matters.\n\nOf course, you probably don't put any stock into such matters because its a religious text and you (like myself) don't believe a word of it. So would it really matter if it was supposedly written by someone who had met Jesus?\n\nWhy isn't this ever brought up? Because those who believe in religion don't care about matters of authorship enough to worry, and those who don't believe in religion know that fiction, by definition, *can't* be witnessed firsthand.",

It was to centralize the beliefs of Jesus and Christianity so that there weren\u2019t any confusion. It was under the edict of Milan in 313 AD under Roman Emperor Constantine I. The idea was to establish that Christianity was to not be punished as a free religion. \n\n325 AD, the first council of Nicaea was to start the working on the book and to established centralized celebrations. \n\nIn 355 AD, the council of Milan was formed to formalize Christianity under one religion. \n\nIn 451 AD, the council of Milan formalized what is now known as the New Testament. \n\nKeep in mind that Jesus supposedly died in 28AD, but historians think it was likely in later 12BC that Jesus was born and died in 7AD. \n\nSo 400+ years later, the leaders of Christianity got together to formalize the religion and create the New Testament. It has been translated at least into 704 different languages, with the New Testament (part of the bible) being translated 1,551 in other languages and 1,160 portions of the bible being translated in other languages. \n\nOverall there are roughly 2,000 versions of the bible that have been created since the first version that was written back in 451 AD. 50 versions have survived today. \n\nFor a book that many people take literally, it has been written, rewritten, translated, retranslated, adapted, changed and morphed into the most common version today that is the King James Bible. But this doesn\u2019t include the versions that Jehovah\u2019s Witness, Mormons, Episcopalians, and other sects of Christianity use. \n\nSo when people ask if you\u2019ve read the good book, ask them which version. Then drop this tidbit about how many versions there out there that have different meanings and translations.\n\nEdit: Another fun fact but the Shroud that Jesus supposedly wiped his face with on the day he was to be crucified is actually a fake. There\u2019s evidence that it was used by charlatans as part of a side show. Even Pope Clement the VII declared it fake over 600 years ago.",

It\u2019s actually ironically part of what helped me deconstruct my faith.\n\nMost fundamentalist scholars actually maintain that the gospel of Matthew was written by the apostle of the same name, and that Mark and Luke were largely based on Matthew\u2019s writing (I might have that origin messed up a little bit\u2014I vaguely recall some speculation that Mark wrote his gospel at the behest and narration of Simon Peter, and that Matthew and Luke were based on that, but it\u2019s been over a decade since I was tested on this \u201cknowledge,\u201d and I can\u2019t be asked to find my notes on it). Luke\u2019s gospel in particular is believed to have been composed after the author conducted \u201crigorous investigations\u201d into events, including interviews with eyewitnesses, and seeking out corroborating evidence and testimony. These are the \u201csynoptic\u201d gospels, and in fundamentalist tradition, they\u2019re considered to be more reliable than the gospel of John, which is thought to contain some hyperbole (a lot of this comes from the \u201cfact\u201d that a lot of writings around that time didn\u2019t consider accuracy to be of the same importance we place on it today, and focused more heavily on the point they were trying to make).\n\nAlso, saying \u201cthe Bible was written 60-100 years after Jesus died\u201d will make you seem unintelligent to fundies if you try to debate them on it. In their belief, the Bible is a collection of 66 different pieces of historical literature, with authorship spanning between 1500 and 6000 years. The Old Testament by itself is a collection of Hebrew religious documents whose traditions have them spanning ~1500 years of authorship. Even most non-Christian scholars engaging in source criticism will suggest that the documents in the Old Testament were composed during the Persian Empire, likely during the reconstruction of Jerusalem described in the book of Nehemiah (or shortly thereafter). That puts it at ~400 B.C. if I remember my world history. Fundies prefer to subscribe to the Jewish tradition though, because it lends to a belief in more authenticity in the scripture.\n\nThey also fully believe that Paul\u2019s encounter with Christ as described in the book of Acts was genuine, and that the ministry described of him there is accurate. This is why most of the New Testament consists of letters written by Paul to the early church, and why they consider it to be just as infallible as the rest of the Bible.\n\nNote: I am not a fundamentalist anymore and have divorced myself from the church. I\u2019m not sure what I believe, aside from the fact that organized religion is a source of great evil, and that any such beliefs ought to be deeply personal things that help guide personal decisions. I just happen to know how they think, because I was one among them for quite some time. I do not want to debate on this (as I don\u2019t personally subscribe to it), I\u2019m simply explaining what they believe. Don\u2019t @ me.",

MacDonald proposes that the gospel of Mark - the first of the canonical gospels and which Mattew and Luke both relied, was written as a prose anti-epic, presenting Jesus (a figure from Jewish lore) as a suffering hero modeled after but far superior to traditional Greek heroes.  In this view, the author of Mark would have expected his audience to recognize the Homeric antecedents in his story of Jesus. \n\nMuch like Odysseus, Mark\u2019s Jesus sails the seas with uncomprehending companions, encounters preternatural opponents, and suffers many things before confronting rivals who have made his house a den of thieves. In his death and burial, Jesus emulates Hector, although unlike Hector Jesus leaves his tomb empty. Mark\u2019s minor characters, too, recall Homeric predecessors: Bartimaeus emulates Tiresias; Joseph of Arimathea, Priam; and the women at the tomb, Helen, Hecuba, and Andromache. And, entire episodes in Mark mirror Homeric episodes, including stilling the sea, walking on water, feeding the multitudes, the Triumphal Entry, and Gethsemane.  \n\nWhen you consider the fact that Mark is riddled with factual errors of Jewish Law and custom and Roman Law,  and geographical errors, it's a wonder that anybody was ever so stupid to think that it was anything but a story.  \n\nCheck out https://infidels.org/library/modern/richard-carrier-homerandmark/  and spare me the histrionics about Richard Carrier.",

It's crazy difficult to figure out things about old documents from antiquity or earlier (who wrote them, when they were written, what the original text said). For example, consider The Illiad. Generally assumed to ben written down sometime in the 8th century BC, the earliest surviving copy is on clay tablets dating to around the 3rd century AD. Moreover, there are not that many copies before the 6th century, making it difficult to know what Homer originally wrote, and its also hard to prove whether Homer wrote it or not. It's really a fascinating area of study (not what I do for a living, just something I enjoy reading about). Anyway, that was a roundabout introduction to saying, if you're interested in this I'd recommend doing a lot more research as the subject is a lot more complicated (and interesting!) than everyone is making it out to be.",

Evidence suggests it was at least circulated in some form by 70 ad (less than 40 years after Jesus died)\u2014 possibly earlier, and most definitely written earlier.  Scribeship was a pretty big/expensive endeavor in that time-period and could take years to finance and produce. Historians suggest that John was possibly as young as 13 when he was with Jesus.\n\nMark was written in 66 AD and while the writer most likely wasn\u2019t Mark the apostle- there\u2019s NO way to rule out that it wasn\u2019t written by one of the disciples. It certainly is plausible from a timeline standpoint- being written only 33 years after Jesus\u2019 death. \n\nLuke was not a disciple nor an eyewitness and the texts of that gospel do not purport as such. the concept that Luke was a disciple is merely a misnomer. \nLuke was most likely a believer and possibly missionary who traveled with Paul. He was a writer who was hired to document and assemble the stories of Jesus and the early church from eyewitnesses(or second hand).",

Every gospel had a different writer and was written at a different time, yet the gospels when combined deliver an accurate testimony to Jesus life leading up to his death. \n\nA short example,\nBook of Matthew Chapter 26\nThey are trying to put Jesus on Trial and are angry at him.\n\nThen they began to spit in Jesus\u2019 face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him, jeering, \u201cProphesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you that time?\"\n\nWhy would they be asking Jesus who hit him if they are right in front of him ?\n\nWell, we find the answer to that in another gospel.\nLuke 22\n\nThe guards in charge of Jesus began mocking and beating him. They blindfolded him and said, \u201cProphesy to us! Who hit you that time?\u201d\r\n\nSimple example of how each gospel fills in the details that another misses and doesn't have any contradictions .\n\nI could be wrong, don't listen to me, check it out for yourself .",

              "text": "You are swaying from my original statement. \nJesus' death would have numerous accounts of his death because it was widely public and had witnesses unlike Judas's death. \n\nBut okay, ill answer your question.\nWe know Judas betrayed Jesus because Jesus told his disciples at the last supper and the gospels tell us that the money Judas earned from the betrayal was used for a field that he died in. We can both agree that the 2 gospels have this in mind. The \"completely\" different accounts you are talking about are merely the 2 details of where and how. \n\n1. The field Judas eventually died in, both gospels name the field as 'Field of Blood'. The ONLY discrepancy one can find is the detail of how the field was obtained .\n\nActs 1:18\nNow this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity\n\nMatthew 27:7\nSo they took counsel and bought with them the potter\u2019s field as a burial place for strangers\n\nSo, did Judas buy the field or was the field bought after Judas was found dead?  My only explanation is that the priests, using the money Judas earned, bought the field and named Judas as the purchaser. After all , the priests deemed the money blood money and wanted no relation to it.\n\nMatthew 27:5 \nThen Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself. The leading priests picked up the coins. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be right to put this money in the Temple treasury,\u201d they said, \u201csince it was payment for murder.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing completely different here, are the details found not what you should expect when hearing a story written by 2 different people having 2 different views on things? \n\n2. Judas' Death. So once again, the \"completely different\" account you are referring to must be how Judas actually died, both say Judas died. Matthew says he died by \"hanging'' and Luke says he died by \"falling headfirst there, his body split open, spilling out all his intestines.\"\r\nThe explanation- Matthew said how he died and Luke went into literal detail of his death. If you watch enough crime dramas you know that the body starts to decompose after it has died, well similarly Judas was a human and so his body also started to decompose in the heat and eventually the rope had to snap due to the strain. I hate to go into the science and biology of this but long story short, his body was turned to mush and was like a balloon so once he fell it essentialy exploded. \n\nI fail to see how completely different the 2 accounts are, these are 2 different views by 2 different people of the same event. They aren't identical stories, nor would I expect them to be, but for an event like Judas' Death, with no witnesses I find it absolutely wild to see the lack of discrepancies that it has.\n\nI hope this makes things more clear and do ask if you have any more questions.",

The names were assigned to them in around 200 AD. \n\nThey were most likely written by second and third generation Greek speaking Christians living in Syria and Anatolia, now a part of Turkey. The evidence for this is that they were first written in fairly sophisticated Koine Greek (John is the exception written in more stilted Greek), a language the disciples would have known only a few words of at best and would certainly have been incapable of writing. They also contain geographical, Jewish cultural and legal errors which indicate that the authors were not natives of Judea or Galilee, or Jewish which the disciples supposedly were.",

Most scholars believe that they were oral accounts that were eventually written down after the eye witnesses of Jesus\u2019s life started dying off. A lot of this is conjecture though. This all happened over 2000 years ago. Even the years you throw out of 60-100 isn\u2019t universally accepted.

Wars have been fought over disagreements on this stuff. \n\nThat all being said, I don\u2019t think any of it is a reason to or not to believe in God. It\u2019s just interesting historical analysis.",

Even though the gospels were written in the late 1st century into the 2nd century, there are many texts, like Paul's letters, that were written around 15-20 years after Jesus died. Paul would've known some of the earlier followers of Jesus, including his brother James (though Christian's consider him more of a cousin to Jesus).\n\nIf you want to debate about the existence of God or Jesus, this is not a good argument. Many texts that we consider ancient \"primary sources\" were written long after its subjects died (eg. Plutarch, Polybius, Arrian, etc.) The people who first discovered the timeline of the gospels were Christians themselves, and any student studying to become a priest or religious scholar will learn this in their first year. This fact doesn't disprove anything in the bible because any (properly) educated Christian knows that the point of the gospels isn't 100% historical accuracy, it's a religious narrative about the life of a holy figure.",

      "text": "Aight so few things need mentioned here: \"The Bible\" is two collections. The Old Testament, which itself is the Torah and the rest of it, and The New Testament.\n\n The Old Testament is the oral history and folklore of the ancient Jewish people, including their origin story and verbal tradition about the point leading up to and through the building of the first two Temples in Jerusalem. It is a history passed down until it was written, and then also it was the rules of the religion and how it was to be practiced to atone for the Original Sin. This takes place a thousand years before Jesus at least, and has nothing to do with him other than to show the history of the Jews as they tell it and follow it up to that point.\n\nThe New Testament starts with the four Broski's, Matthew Mark Luke and John. This is the entirety of Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. After that is predominantly the travels of Paul throughout the Mediterranean and his letters to various groups or individuals while they are founding the first Churches. Paul, btw, lived at the time of Jesus and either personally knew him or knew those that did know him. The very last book was Revelations and is about early Christian beliefs regarding the return of Jesus and, well, the end of the world.\n\nThe \"Writers of the Bible\" are a diverse group spanning thousands of years, and Jesus was only alive for like 30 of them. If you're gonna ridicule religion, be knowledgeable about it. Being just as false as religious nuts doesnt help.",

This is the nature of religion sadly - you point out glaring flaws and they get ignored with ease. \n\nThere\u2019s no contemporary evidence for Jesus outside of the bible, that\u2019s another big one to add to your arsenal. \n\nCheck out \u201cthe atheist experience\u201d on YouTube - that show unpacks some great arguments and some awesome rebuttals to theist arguments",

Or the fact that the language that was used to write the Bible was a very basic language, so things like walking across the water and walking on the water are written the same way.\n\nThen, there are the chapters of the Bible that are left out because they are insane. Jesus fended off dragons, for instance.  Then the several rewrites...and it's a questionable book at best.  That's why there is so much blind faith to it.

While it\u2019s absolutely true that Matthew, Mark, and John didn\u2019t write the books we have today, the names they have is based on a tradition of use and on convention from early copies that have been discovered. Luke is entirely open about the nature of the book we have, and opens with these verses, \u201cMany have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word. Therefore, since I myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s realistically no reason that the accounts need to have been written by those people (Mark and Luke weren\u2019t even disciples) in order to be historically relevant or reliable. If you\u2019re shocked to find out that the accounts of the gospels are thought to have been started 60-100 years after his death, just wait till you find out how shaky the textual evidence is for almost every historical event before the Renaissance. Most of Roman history (contemporary to the New Testament) comes down to us from one or two sources at a time, and most often centuries after the fact. \n\nThe premise here is faulty, simply because you\u2019re applying a standard to the Bible that would be ridiculous if applied to any contemporary work of literature. \n\nFor those saying that the Bible wasn\u2019t even formed until the Council of Nicea, a very small amount of research can show that the council just ratified was was already a common-use canon.\n\nGnostic gospels are fun to read about on Wikipedia, but most are an entirely different genre than the four canonical gospels and all except Timothy date to well after the synoptics and John. \n\nDon\u2019t take it from me, check out what sources you can find from academics. With the Bible being so polarizing, a lot of people on both sides have very strong, poorly informed opinions, so I\u2019d be wary of quick pithy answers from anyone on this.",

The specific claim I made was, \"the stories _could_ be accurate (or at least accurate enough) **for the purposes intended.**\" Bolding added for emphasis.\n\nMeaning, the stories written decades after the oral tradition began could be accurate to the stories told a year after the events.\n\nThere is a process for formal stories to be solidified, so there are definitely inaccuracies between the events being described and the writings. These can come from errors in earlier retellings, or from misremembered events, embellishments, intentional misinformation, whatever.\n\n>The job of an historian is to record what most likely happen.\n\nNot really. It's to record their _understanding_ of what happened, which would ideally be what actually did happen. Remember the phrase, \"History is written by the victors.\"\n\nIn the best case, we have multiple records of the same events, as written by different people, along with physical evidence, so that forensic historians might extract a more accurate truth from the interpretations, but historians documenting events will always have an interpretive lens.\n\n>Are You saying that the accounts would be as accurate if written by eye witnesses compared to written by people who never met the Jesus.\n\nIt is possible. I'm not saying it definitely is, but it is possible. Think about how many people can accurately retell their favorite comedian's funny story; obviously, not everyone is 100% accurate, _but some people are_. It's possible to retell stories over and over again, between multiple people, and not lose content.\n\nPeople liken oral tradition to a game of telephone, where the end result sounds totally different to the initial phrase, but that game is _designed_ to cause errors: limited time; no going back to previous person; minimal repetition/practice, and a collection of people whom don't do regularly do accurate retellings.\n\nOral tradition is more like theater: endless repetition and rehearsals, time to practice and memorize, feedback/reference back to source, and it's a job.\n\nAre those stories accurate to _events_? Maybe. But even eyewitness accounts can be inaccurate, so that's not any better than if the written record was done by the eyewitness themselves.\n\n>A miricle, by definition, is the least likely thing to happen. \n\nYes or no, depending on your definition of miracle, and your personal tolerance of faith. \n\nIf \"miracle\" is simply \"highly improbable, but still technically possible under natural law\", then even with 0 faith, miracles _will_ happen, given enough time. For example, there was a guy who won a lottery, then won again while a camera crew was present to film a \"dramatic recreation\" of the initial winning. It's already improbable to win once, moreso to win twice, and even more so to win during a news coverage filming of your first win; and yet, it happened. \n\nHowever, if by \"miracle\" you mean \"physically impossible\", such as walking on water, turning water into wine or resurrecting after 3 days, then you're being asked to have faith in the source. These are events which, by definition, can't be reproduced without divine intervention, and therefore require faith that such intervention is even possible.\n\nIn both cases, if the historian is an eyewitness, they should record what they experienced. If the historian is not a witness, they should record their sources accurately and provide their interpretation. Either way, the historian should record the miracle.",

Also, what definition of \"history book\"? I'm not going to take the time searching for one of you're going to then claim, \"That's not a miracle/history book.\"\n\nFor one thing, I specifically stated that the Bible is _not_ a factually accurate record of history. It's not a history book. At most, it is a historical document, meaning it is a document written during a certain time period that has _some_ claims of events, but more importantly, provides a perspective on the things that mattered to the authors at the time. \n\nFor example, the opening of Luke (?) is a claim about the genealogical history of Jesus, \"son of David, son of Abraham\", explicitly naming the generations from Abraham to David, then David to Joseph, who was the legal father of Jesus (remember, the claim is that Mary was discovered to be pregnant just before/after Joseph married her; he was allegedly convinced by an angel in a dream to not leave her and that the child was God's, so they married and didn't fuck until after the birth... \ud83e\udd26). Is the genealogy factually accurate? I doubt it. Why is it there? Probably to lend a sense of legitimacy to Jesus through a connection to important figures in Jewish history/myth. It's a form of appeal to authority.",

      "text": "Diving into r/atheism to debate probably isn't going to give me a productive day, but here goes...\n\nSo the earliest writings were by Paul, who started writing his letters c.15-20 years after the crucifixion. Whilst we don't have original letters, other verified Christian writings from the next hundred years make it clear that Paul's letter writing was a well known thing, so even if the letters we have are fictions, we can be confident that he did at least write something. Scholarly analysis of the content of the letters in the Bible suggests that at least a good portion of them are genuinely Pauline (I'm not an expert, so I can't give you the full details of how historians assess the legitimacy of a source's authorship, but there are lots of papers and books out there about it for those more interested).\n\nNow, Paul never met Jesus, at least not physically. He openly admits that he met Jesus after the crucifixion, but what form that took is left unclear (later writers (Acts) would claim that it was a vision on the road to Damascus). He does talk however about meeting the disciples. It's clear from his letters that there is a community of Christians around the Eastern Mediterranean, centred on Jerusalem, and led by the disciples, who are led by Peter and James. Paul seems to be in tension with them on occasions, which would lend credence to their existence, as if Paul's making the whole thing up then he wouldn't invent a dispute with the people who actually knew the guy he's claiming to be speaking for.\n\nSo what we can establish based on this is the following:\n\n- The disciples existed\n- The disciples believed and taught that Jesus had existed, that they had met him, that he had been crucified, and that after his crucifixion he reappeared to them\n\nOf course, maybe they were all madmen/con artists. That can't be proved/disproved - it's a matter of faith. But the Bible does contain relatively contemporaneous accounts of Jesus' life, and whilst not providing a first hand account, does support that that first hand account did exist.",

He was frequently getting in fights with the actual apostles by his own admission. He calls himself an apostle and talks about how he is in no way inferior to the real apostles, although when the real apostles are choosing a replacement apostle for Judas Iscariot, the requirements are that his replacement was with them for the whole 3 year ministry of Jesus from John the Baptist's baptism to the crucifixion. Paul even claims he works harder than the real apostles at one contentious point.\n\nEverything about Paul rubs me the wrong way. Especially the anti-woman/anti-gay stuff that comes from him, that Jesus never said a word about. The guy had a very unforgiving ethic about sexual matters, but writes almost nothing about violence...very convenient for someone who was present at at least 1 murder by stoning and probably culpable in many other such murders.",

And not by the disciples after whom they are named. It is quite likely these disciples were illiterate anyways.\n\nIt's clear there was some source material used when writing them, either contemporaneous written reports or just oral stories of accounts passed down, but I think this original material has been lost to time.\n\nKeep in mind, also, that 'The Bible' as we currently know it, is just a selection of many different stories and accounts that were lumped together by a what amounted to a committee formed by Emperor Constantine.  There was so much that had been written about Jesus, and much of it conflicted, so there was a lot of argument between what was legitimate and what was not. Constantine wanted to put an end to the infighting and select a few books that everyone could more or less agree on, and basically throw out the rest.\nHe mostly failed at stopping the arguing. But he certainly succeeded at narrowing the written accounts of Jesus down to just those selected for inclusion in The Bible, seeing as how nobody talks about the other books that didn't make the cut, and probably much of them have been lost.",

      "text": "That is not entirely true. There are four exceptions, maybe five, maybe six, depending on who you ask. Theoretically the four canonical Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John), are all at least derived from what the apostles wrote or dictated. Three of them are pretty similar (synoptic Gospels, Matthew Mark Luke), so the academic view is that they were likely derived from one source to some degree, either one of the three or a different fourth source, possibly dictations of someone who knew Jesus. So it is possible, at least for non-skeptics, that at least some of the early Christians who might be responsible for these attempts at recording the life and teachings of Jesus had seen him in the flesh. That said, most scholars think the authors were likely in Paul\u2019s cadre, probably early Greek-speaking.\n\nThe Book of James is traditionally attributed to James, Jesus\u2019s brother. So a non-skeptic could count that one. Although scholars these days think it was an early Christian possibly in Peter\u2019s church who wrote it and used James\u2019s name to give it credibility.\n\nRevelations is traditionally attributed to John. However, most think this is unlikely. Whoever it was was probably reading the prophetic letters in Greek, during or within one generation of Nero. But if you want to be a good Bible study buddy, the traditional answer is that the author of this was John, one of Jesus\u2019s closest disciples.\n\nPersonally, I think it is all mostly rubbish. Jesus was probably a small time cult leader, probably a Jewish extremist, who became increasingly popular shortly before and/or after the time of his death. Peter was his \u201csuccessor\u201d and went on to lay the foundation for Catholicism, and my understanding is that Paul never even met Jesus. Paul was probably a small time bureaucrat for the Romans who saw an opportunity to con a bunch of suckers.\n\nQuick edit: what I find most amazing, though, is how few Christians really know the Gospels, which theoretically contain the verbatim teachings of Jesus Christ. He said it pretty clearly: if you want to go to heaven, be like me.  And now Christianity is basically a multi level marketing scheme.",

What I never did, was actually listen to the \",other side\".   When God drove me to church, the first place I started my journey was the life of Jesus. God drove me to a Christian church, so it made sense to listen to those making the case, not only to those arguing against it. Which means listening to experts (people with educations in appropriate backgrounds...history, languages, archeology, etc), who believe the gospels were written by the people they are attributed to. \n\nLike much of accepted history, it is true no one can tell you 100 percent John wrote John, and here is a short video of him recorded doing so. I'm not a historian, listening to historians explaining \"how history works\", and verifying the things they were saying, changed my perspective on a lot of things, in history, not just this one thing. I guess it opened my heart just enough for the Truth to step in. I couldn't go back to doubting the existence of God or my savior Jesus Christ for anything. \n\nMy point isn't to make you roll your eyes and to believe I'm \"brainwashed\".  I understand it sounds crazy. I was you. I don't think there is anything anyone could say to me that I haven't said to someone at some point about God, Jesus, the Bible, Christianity, or Christians. So, if  I'm crazy for Jesus, I guess I can live with that.  I hope others learn to live that way too :)",

I would say don't take my word for it, and actually do some digging on these things yourself, but you would just take someone else's word for something that they dug up which counters my statements (although I would question their \"facts\")  \n\n\n>Writers of bible never met Jesus when he was alive.\n\nWhat do you mean by this? The Bible is a collection of 66 books spanning over 1500+ years. Some of the content of the earliest books would have been handed down via oral tradition). So of course those writers would have never met Him. \n\nThe only ones that would have met Jesus would have been the writers of the Gospels and those that were witnesses to His resurrection / ascension. A good majority of their text would have been destroyed in the sacking of Jerusalem in 70 AD if the text would have existed.  \n\n\n>It was written 60-100 years after Jesus died\n\nThere are wildly varying accounts on dating when the gospels were written. Older scholars agreed that they were written between 50 - 90 AD, while modern scholars say 70 - 110 with the last being the gospel of John. The problem with the modern scholar's argument is that Jerusalem was the siege of Jerusalem happened in 70 AD which none of the Gospels (nor any of the New Testament, other than the prophecy Jesus gave) spoke about the temple being destroyed.\n\nRegardless, that would put the range at 37 - 77 years after His death. Given that each apostle had assignments from Jesus, it would make sense that they would have written down their accounts or orally recounted their stories to scribes as was Jewish tradition. This would have been a process taking some time.  \n\n\n>No eyewitness accounts in the bible\n\nBoth Matthew and John were disciples and apostles of Jesus.   \n\n\n* Matthew was a tax collector and would have kept a fairly accurate account of events. \n* John was the closest to Jesus and alluded to who he was in his writing \"This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.\".\n* Luke interviewed eye witnesses and so that is where his account comes from .\"1:1 Since many have undertaken to arrange in proper order an account of the events that have been fulfilled among us, **just as from the beginning the eyewitnesses and those becoming ministers of the Word handed down to us**, so also it seemed good to me, accurately following and investigating everything from the first, to write to you in order (an account), most excellent Theophilus, so that you may know the certainty of the words (of the gospel) you have been taught.\"\n* Mark remains the questionable one. He is assumed to be John Mark, Paul's associate from Acts 12:12 & 15:37. There is also some speculation that he is the young man described in Mark 14:51-52 who, wearing only a linen cloth, followed Jesus. When he was seized by the Roman soldiers, he escaped capture and ran, leaving the garment behind. The identity of the man is unknown, but since the Gospel of Mark is the only gospel that mentions the incident, many Bible scholars speculate that the young man was John Mark himself, the author of the Gospel of Mark.\n\nAll of these accounts and references can be found within the Bible.  Sure you could say, well that's in the bible and not an external source and you would be right, but that doesn't make it any less true. That would be like saying all biographies are false because they were written by someone else. There are things that Jesus said which were very true and there is some archaeological evidence for the things that were written as well. \n\nBesides the archaeological evidence, there are also other written references outside of the Bible such as one account by Dionysius, a member of the council in Greece which witnessed a strange astronomical event during the same time frame as the crucifixion of Jesus where the sun was completely blacked out. This same Dionysius was spoken about in Acts 17:34.  Thallus, a secular writer, had written a similar account of this event.\n\nThen you have other sources which pointed back to the existence of Jesus, but again some modern scholars have debated the authenticity of their works. For example Josephus, Tacitus, Mara Bar-Serapion, and Pliny the Younger. Most people know all of those sources though, so no point in rehashing that.",

Peter and several other apostles were alive with Paul doing ministry (Acts 15), so it could not have been that long a period after the death of Jesus.  \n\n\n>Other gospels were written much later and plagiarized from form the first.\n\nAgain, who or where is this claim coming from? \n\nFor example, just looking into the Gospel of John, the earliest \"copied\" manuscript available is P66. This was dated for no later than 150AD. Some dating techniques show it to be dated to a much earlier 100 AD. The P56 fragment of John was dated to 90 - 120 AD. Again these all depend on the scholar, but it's hardly hundreds of years. \n\nI bring up John's Gospel, because it is the most unique amongst all the others.",

Again, I detect a lot of uncertainty in the language used such as \"probable\", \"possible\", \"it seems like\", and \"hypothetical\". Throwing out chunks of the New Testament based on \"style of writing\" was an argument that a couple modern scholars such as Bart Ehrman used and is based purely on opinion, not an actual fact (something proven to be true).\n\nEhrman went as far to say that Timothy used vocabulary that wasn't consistent with Paul. Check this out:\n\n>\"There are 848 different words used in the pastoral letters. Of that number, 306, over one-third of them! do not occur in any of the other Pauline letters of the New Testament. That\u2019s an inordinately high number; especially given the fact that about two-thirds of these 306 words are used by Christian authors living in the second century. **This suggests** the author is using a vocabulary that was becoming more common after the days of Paul, and that he too, therefore, lived after Paul.\u201d \\~ **Forged: Writing In The Name Of God \u2013 Why The Bible\u2019s Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are. Pg 112 (Ehrman)**\n\nSimilar uncertain language \"this suggests\", it's not fact, it's Bart's opinion..\n\nWe all know that we use a different range of vocabulary based upon our audience. Paul\u2019s letters to Timothy were personal letters written to one of his spiritual sons and a fellow minister of the gospel. Unlike his letter to the Romans, a large church body whom he hadn\u2019t met yet. It\u2019s not hard to see why his vocabulary would be different. But this is the \"evidence\", Ehrman and other scholars use as \"factual\" information. It is absolutely nothing but conjecture.\n\nOne has to bring into question motive when thinking about these things. Why would someone write something like this? For a good reason, it sells books!",

                                  "text": "I question the veracity of the two videos and claims made in them and not the full body of work that the content creator has done themselves. I only do this because the \"facts\" that the content creator presented in those the two videos seem to be rooted strongly in opinion, rather than truth or any actual hard factual evidence. Listen to the words the narrator uses when speaking about the topics they are addressing.\n\nFor example, in the content creator's video on \"Oldest Bible Manuscripts\", the existence for the manuscripts mentioned is proven and the manuscripts themselves are verifiable, meaning you can actually experience them in person. As such, the language the narrator uses you can pick out what the narrator believes to be truth and facts by the wording used.\n\nWhat do I mean by that? In the two videos in question, you often hear the words \"probably\", \"likely\", or \"it is possible\", but not in this video. The only time you hear those introductory phrases is when the narrator speaks of the actual dates of the manuscripts from the New Testament. The fact that the manuscripts exist does not warrant the same language, but since the dates may change (depending on who's doing the dating), the language used to present the \"fact\" changes from authoritive and affirming something, to speculatory.\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that they do not use the same speculatory language when speaking of the Hebrew manuscripts.\n\nTo further this point, for some reason at 18:33 in that video the narrator switches to speaking about Billy Graham (which has nothing to do with the manuscripts). They use a word they have not said throughout the entire video, \"supposedly\". This implies the narrator can not verify the veracity of Mr. Graham's statement and instead indicates that the narrator doubts the truth of the statement Graham made. They then go on to present a case against Mr. Graham's statement with \"facts\" that they presented earlier (but used the same speculative language) that the dates were \"probably\" accurate.\n\nI've noticed when it comes to anything dealing with Jesus Christ, the narrator, Matt Baker, seems to have a bias. He admits to holding to Jewish beliefs, and I can clearly see that the information presented about Christ may or may not be accurate. This is made even more apparent in his video \"How CE became an alternative to AD\". In this regard, I wish he were an atheist, Even then some atheists have biases which effect the \"truth\" they both present and are willing to accept.\n\nTLDR: Pay attention to the words people use and how they introduce \"facts\".  It's an indication of truth vs opinion. Don't look at everything from a surface level, but dig deep. If someone has a bias, their \"facts\" will be affected.",

The disciples and apostles are one in the same.\n\n* In Matthew 10, Jesus gave His disciples power over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease. Then a little later in the same chapter sent them out. This is why they were called apostolos (or persons sent, Apostles).\n* After the death and resurrection of Jesus, once again he called on His 11 remaining disciples to go out to all nations and make more disciples (Matt 28:19). Again establishing the Apostleship (or persons sent).\n* Finally in Acts 1:2, it does say that they were given instructions via the \"Holy Spirit\", but it didn't negate the original command in Matt. 28:19 or Matt. 10 that Jesus had gave them. This was further presented in Acts 1:26, where the author specifically notes 11 apostles (due to Judas having committed suicide) and having to choose another apostle. Matthias was chosen which we do not know anything about him other than he was a disciple from the 120 that remained of the original 500 (1 Cor. 15:6).\n\nHope this helps!",

A couple examples: \n\n1.Adam and Eve represent the concious and subconcious mind.  \n2.Jesus represents every one of us who carries the cross (burden of material inclination) and what we must do to overcome the desire of flesh - experience the death of the ego and rebirth of spirit. \n\nApply that logic to the rest of the Bible and maybe you'll learn a thing or two about how your mind works and how to be a better person. \n\nGod isn't a person.  He isn't an old man in white robes who punishes those who don't believe in him.  God is simply a word used to denote something greater than ourselves which will remain unknown in this life and more than likely the next.  Perhaps God is just the universe or maybe we are our own personal God.  Only God can judge us means only we can judge ourselves\n\nAd far as the people who wrote the Bible: probably didn't use their real names.  And without a doubt they didn't know Jesus because Jesus wasn't a real person.  He is a symbol.  Nothing more nothing less.  \n\nJust my belief on the subject.  Doesn't discredit your belief or anyone else's.",

So Matthew had experiences with Jesus after his resurrection, but Mark decided to leave that part out? Matthew told Mark that the two Marys even spoke to Jesus at the tomb but Mark decided not to include that? Matthew knew about the virgin birth that fulfilled prophecy but did he not tell Mark that part or did Mark not find that part important for some reason?\n\nEDIT to the deleted response: Oh are you referring to the long ending of Mark that is not there in the older manuscripts and was added in the 2nd century? And if Mark was written for the Romans, who didn\u2019t care about prophecy, why does Mark start the gospel with a prophecy from Malachi and Isaiah?",

No author in the Bible claims to have met Jesus.\n\nThe manuscripts for these texts don't contain titles like \"Gospel of John\", these are titles that were added nearly 200 years later.

That's how it works. That's how it always works.\n\n>Atheism and Christianity, however are chained in a whirlpool of subjective thinking.\n\nRefusing to accept unlikely claims without evidence is the opposite of subjective thinking.\n\n>We can't prove that there is a God, but we also can't prove that a God does not exist. \n\nThat's such an absurdly tired argument that it's covered by the subreddit FAQ. Short version is that the lack of evidence we see for God is totally consistent with things that don't exist. Things that exist necessarily leave evidence of their existence.\n\n>There is a power higher than us though that will be around long after we are gone.\n\nThat's the claim. Where's the evidence?",

                              "text": "I want to start this by saying, my attempt isn't to disprove the notion that these were not written by the apostles but rather to find a legitimate claim by the authors of the sources on the authorship of the gospels preserved by history. I gain nothing from \"proving\" that first-hand correspondents wrote the Gospels of Jesus. I am just trying to analyze what's there as I do not trust Wikipedia to use sources accurately and have often found the website harmful in its distribution of information as \"facts\" in my own line of work.\n\nIn the first section \"Gospel of Mark\" the source for 84 is \"Theissen, Gerd; Merz, Annette (1998). The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide. Fortress Press.\". This source is to verify that \"most modern scholars, therefore, reject the authorship of John Mark.\" In that text, you see that the authors instead:\n\n>In many respects a survey of the Christian sources about Jesus has a sobering effect. First of all it shows that even in the earliest sources at our disposal we do not encounter the historical Jesus, but pictures of Jesus, memories which have been shaped by theological and social interests and convictions and the history of the groups which handed them down. Moreover the earliest more extensive sources available to us were written down only in the second Christian generation. Despite isolated assertions to the contrary, none of the non-canonical sources is older than the Gospel of Mark either. Certainly many of the writings from primitive Christianity go back to traditions, sometimes written, which preceded them, but the originals have been lost (presumably without recall). We can partially reconstruct their form by careful analysis (see above 2.2 on Q and\u00a7 4 on methodological procedures), but the results remain hypothetical, and the exact wording of the earliest sources about Jesus is unknown. What is perhaps most irritating is the knowledge that, as the large number of Gospels preserved in fragments indicates, we know only a small section of the range of traditions about Jesus which existed e.g. in the year 150 CE - and this is probably not a 'representative cross-section'. For the selection that we have today owes itself only to a slight degree to 'blind chance'; it has been governed considerably more strongly by church-political processes like the canonization of the Synoptic Gospels and John and the deliberate elimination of 'apocryphal' Gospels.\n\nThe author is stating that the Gospels, as in the modern bible, are not the original but fragments of the original. Therefore it is uncertain who the author is or who the curator is but we know the entirety of the book is not attributed to the one author. We know later that several religious institutions did the curation of the earliest work. The author makes no effort to say that none of the work is written by the Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, but instead, there is more than enough evidence that it has been tampered with and no original exists.\n\nThe authors are then later quoted as saying:\n\n>'We can begin from the assumption that the decisive aspects of the activity and words of Jesus, those which are to be noted for our faith, have been preserved in the Gospels. The fact that we find some tradition, though not much, outside the Gospels, suggests that some Jesus material has been lost. Scholars speak of agrapha, unwritten traditions ... \\[Acts 20.35 follows as an example\\]. Small groups of sayings of the Lord can be found in the Apostolic Fathers which seem not to have been quoted from a Gospel, but to have still been in circulation as independent small traditions. But here there were later excrescences and false developments which arose partly from narrative fantasy and partly from heresy, and led to the composition of the apocryphal Gospels. The Gnostic Gospel of Thomas, which was discovered in Upper Egypt in 1947, is a particularly evocative exam\u00adple of this.\n\nThis lies in the author's beliefs that the Gospels preserve the best quotations of Jesus and that others have been lost. Their usage of genuine quotations in the gospels as a measuring stick against Gnostic sources signifies the writer's agreement of, in part, the validity found in the Gospels.\n\nTo summarize that stance further they state:\n\n>'By a process of elimination we are left with twenty one sayings whose attestation and subject matter do not give rise to objections of weight, which are perfectly compatible with the genuine teaching of our Lord, and which have as high a claim to authenticity as the sayings recorded in our four Gospels.'\n\nSo even in Wikipedia's source, there is no agreement on to if the authorship of Mark, in its entirety, is anonymous. It is in agreement by the writers that there is some original text in all four gospels that's origination has been lost to time and can be viewed through an analytical study of the similarities found in fragments across the region. They make no effort to say that the source of the work is not Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John, but rather that the gospels we have now are NOT the reflection of their original writings through noted religious interference.\n\nI have to attend a meeting and review the other 3 sources later.",

(There is a single mention of Pontius Pilate in Roman historical records, but has nothing to do with Jesus.) \n\nIt's just a good guess that Luke and the other apostles wrote their accounts at roughly the same time.  And since their accounts tend to be very similar, and Christianity was a huge movement at the time, I suspect they were real people, and so was Jesus.  The Christianized Jews were accustomed to carrying their holy scriptures wherever they went, so that it is likely why these written accounts survived for so long, and the other books of the new testament as well.  \n\nEven if they wrote all that stuff down, and they were actual disciples, and Jesus was an actual person, doesn't mean the accounts of miracles were true.   Christianity began as an underground religion, in protest of the Roman religious insanity, which was totally monetized and no one, even the Romans themselves, believed it.  \n\nThen the Romans themselves adopted it, and turned it into Catholicism, another monetized religion based on superstitions and mind control.  They suppressed the actual reading of the Bible by the masses.  \n\nThe Protestants evangelicals take the Bible way too seriously, no matter what.  I recall seeing the Songs of Solomon in an old Bible of my grandma's, and it was titled: \"Jesus' Love for his Church.\"  Now that is some bullshit.  The Songs of Solomon were written centuries before Jesus, and they are erotic, romantic love songs.  Solomon probably didn't even write them.",

And I will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things. For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, \u201cThis is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.\u201d We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. We also have the prophetic message as something completely reliable, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. Above all, you must understand that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the prophet\u2019s own interpretation of things. For prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but prophets, though human, spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.",

There's zero evidence of any of that (and lots of evidence of the contrary) but they try to jam things to make it seem true, like numerology on license plates etc. It's not about logic and at one point, they're too invested for them to accept they are wrong, even if all the information of why they are wrong is readily available. They, instead, find obscure sources to give them more comfirmation bias. They don't even notice when they contradict themselves even, like Biden is causing fuel prices to rise as president and then they say Trump is actually acting as president from the background, he never ceeded the election. \n\nReligious people are the same. It's the same mental gymnastics with Bible contradictions, historical inaccuracies, science debunking creation and global flood. They are too deep into their cult.",

Dating is unclear. Its sources and its use as a source for the synpotics is hotly debated.\n\nThere is no such thing as the Gnostic Bible. Gnosticism is a blanket term that means knowledge, and was assigned as a blanket term to describe a family of theologies. It is now considered an unhelpful term in scholarship. You might want to read up on the Valentinians and the Marcionites, two sects that were originally under the Gnostic umbrella, and whose theology is vastly different to Pauline Christianity that we have today. Interestingly, the Gospel of Thomas was not used by either sect and is no longer considered gnostic.\n\nI hope this piques your interest!",

Everything was shared word of mouth at first, but they begin to write it down a few years later to preserve it and share it abroad with those outside of Israel who had no context or prior knowledge of Jesus since they hadn't been there.  Matthew, one of the 12 apostles, being one of the first to start writing his accounts down, and Luke, who wasn't an apostle but a close friend of them all who had also been present and meet Jesus, writing his by interviewing the apostle and others.  \n\nAs a side note, the four Gospels all read a bit different stylistically is because they were written to different cultural audiences-for example Luke wrote his for the Greeks,  which is why Jesus is styled and described using the cultural idea/concept of \"The Perfect Man\" that they were all familiar with to make it relatable to them.  Peter is written to the Hebrews and includes cultural context and references that they would understand.  John is to the every man, meant to speak to one's heart.  Matthew wrote his encyclopedia like to provide as much information as possible/needed to communicate the story.  4 Books, written by those who were they and including information obtained by research and interviewing eyewitness accounts (Dr. Luke's book).\n\nMay I ask, out of curiosity, where you found a source saying they weren't written by them/weren't eyewitness accounts?  I'm curious as to the historical research and documentation that shows that to be true. :)",

              "text": "I'm just looking for a informational source on this.  There is plenty of substantiative evidence in the historical record to prove they existed-census, names and actions recorded in governmental records, records of many of the 12 apostles being executed and never refuting their claims (which why would you die in an excruciating manner for a hoax or falsehood?), and more.  The Romans were great at record keeping.  Paul is recorded in multiple places by sources outside what are considered Biblical sources as well.  Jesus is well documented in the records of the time as existing as well as his disciples.\n\nIf this were not true, there would be historical records from the time to the contrary, pointing out that it wasn't real.  Biblical records have yet to be proven inaccurate as well.  Every attempt to do so has floundered and more often ends up supporting the Biblical record.  We have records from other civilizations that support Biblical accounts.\n\nAs someone who has been a student of history and understands the methods for researching, documenting, and validating historical claims, I must tell you, that much like the Moon Landing in 1969, it would be infinitely harder to fake the Biblical Records and Gospels than for them to actually be true.   As much as one may dislike it or disagree, it would be harder for it to all have been faked and made up than it to be real.  Things like this that are fake have no real substance and peter out eventually, they always have, yet this endures across millennia and the globe, which, logically speaking, means there is something or substance there to keep it going.\n\nAll I'm saying here is that faking it would be a lot harder to do that for it to just be real.  But, you can believe what you wish, all I ask is that you use critical thinking and examine the full scope of historical sources and resources, approaching from and objective point of view.",

I'm curious as to your teachers and the sources and studies they used to support their teachings of such conclusions as I mine used several well researched, developed, and evidence backed studies or historical relics that supported their teaching and conclusions.  It would seem if we have both been taught two different things, someone's teaching didn't fully take into account all of the evidence from the historical record-be it mine or yours.  Having already looked at the whole spectrum of information and research available from secular and non-secular sources on this I must draw the conclusions that I do.  That is why I suggest you should do the same with an objective approach as well.\n\nEither way, in the end, it comes down to having faith and wether you believe it or not.  All I'm saying is that faking it and making it up would have been even harder to do than faking the Moon Landing in in 1969.  So, one must draw the simple conclusion that both happened.

A lot of what is considered Paul's writing has also been found to be forgeries.\n\nHell, even people digging up everywhere to find trace of Moses have realised that he never existed. Even the Jews accept that. \n\nYou can even forget all the historians and scholars and tackle the issue yourself (but most people prefer to hold onto their beliefs) The gospels, if you put them side by side and painstakingly analyse each of them, they don't agree on much. They cannot agree on what happened when Jesus was born to when he supposedly resurrected. I even drew a map of their movements for each nativity story and behold, they don't match. I did this comparison all the way to the story of the ressurection and my god, there's too many contradictions.",

And their plan succeeded; the Holy Roman Empire lives on to this very day as the Catholic Church, all because they were able to fabricate a Messiah (foretold by other religions like Judaism) and focus people on a message to be passive, turn the other cheek, render unto Ceasar what is Ceasar's, pay your taxes without fighting back, and submitting to earthly authority (which were Roman at the time).  \nIt seems like the only plausible explanation to me.  If nothing else, the Romans did a great job of molding the new fad of a monotheistic religion into something that would benefit them and would make the populace more easily controllable.  \nThe fucked up things any government will do just to remain in power and amass more power is astounding.",

Moreover, the tradition about Jesus remained ender the supervision of the apostles.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with apologists - but be aware that their role is to defend the faith.\n\nThere are many opinions on this matter. Have you read anything by Bart Ehrman? He is a professor at Chapel Hill and one of the leading writers in making New Testament scholarship accessible to everyone. His book Forged - a provocative title for sure - may be of interest to you as it discusses at depth the authorship of the New Testament.\n\nAlways be aware of the views of the authors when reading about Christian scholarship - on all sides of the debate - and try reading a variety of sources to get enough information to make an informed viewpoint. There is very little agreement on anything in New Testament scholarship.",

It's believed that Mark wrote his gospel based on the perspective of Peter, who knew Jesus and was a disciple. Also, James and Jude (who wrote the books of James and Jude) were Jesus's brothers...lol.",
