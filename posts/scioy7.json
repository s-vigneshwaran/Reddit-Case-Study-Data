If you think they are rights, show me where in the Bill of Rights or the Constitution it says anything resembling \u201cMen may walk to their cars at night while women may not.\u201d\n\n-I can\u2019t walk to my car at night. Women seem to think men aren\u2019t afraid of the dark. And that mens\u2019 skin can deflect bullets. I\u2019m just as scared of going out at night as you are. \n\n\nNo, but you don\u2019t either. \n\n\nI literally wear the identical outfit every day with maybe a change in jackets. So yes, but not for the reason you implied.\n\n\nYes I can. And so can you. \n\n\n Women get paid less on average. If you want to raise the average, get a higher-paying job you\u2019re uninterested in and will hate. \n\n\nYes they are. That\u2019s the only thing I concede to you up until this point. Though that isn\u2019t a right. \n\n\nSorry, can you elaborate on the sterilization thing? I\u2019d like to know more. \n\n\nYou think birth control should be covered by insurance? \n\n\nNot just the draft. There are two. The other one is circumcision. Constitutionally, (and I\u2019m referring to rights, not privileges) girls can\u2019t be circumcised. But boys are routinely and traditionally circumcised. Female circumcision type 1 is the same as male circumcision. But that\u2019s still banned. Go on r/circumcisiongrief and you\u2019ll see all the depressing stories the people there tell about their circumcisions. It\u2019s saddening that men have to live with the fact their parents paid someone $500 to strap them down and ruin their sex life forever. All it matters to girls is if you prefer cut or uncut.",

Its not just about what rights you have on paper but what personal freedoms you are afforded\n\nYes you might feel the fear of being robbed or shot but thats only in neighborhoods where that occurs. You also wont be blamed for crimes you fall victim to. Women will be. \u201cWhy were you alone at night\u201d \n\nWomen are forced to wear makeup. You can be fired for it and theres nothing women can do about it. Its legal to make women conform to a companies beauty standard.\n\nWomen are not afforded that luxury. Back to the companies beauty standard. Women have to conform to different dress codes than men. Some companies still dont let women wear pants. \n\nNo women cant run with headphones in. Because if someone decides to attack her the first statement will be \u201cwhy did you have both headphones in?\u201d \u201cYou need to be aware\u201d back to that whole women are to blame for their assaults\n\nWomen are paid less for the same positions with the same qualifications. Like thats not something that will change with a career change. Heck now judges are blocking people from being allowed to change jobs. \n\n\nWomen cant be sterilized if they dont already have children. Even if they have children they have to have their husbands sign off on it. Even if the women have ovarian cancer getting the care they need is almost impossible. Women are more likely to be ignored in the medical field in general. Its horrible but women constantly have their problems dismissed as being hysterical or over reacting to their issues and end up dying from heart related problems at a much higher rate than men. Honestly the medical field is really really bad for anyone who isnt a white male. Medical text books often over look symptoms that are common in female and poc patients. Womens symptoms are often much different than mens. \n\n\nIm sorry but if viagra and erectile disfunction treatments are covered by insurance treatments for women\u2019s issues like pcocs and heavy periods which can be treated by birth control should be too. \n\n\nFgm and circumcision are different. Fgm is the complete removal of the clit and often the stitching of the vaginal opening to cause pain in intercourse. The facts on male circumcision in lots of forums like that are heavily misinformed. You do not lose size while hard only flaccid. Which i guess is something if you are insecure but the size of your penis while hard is the same whether or not you are circumcised. Sorry i know that\u2019s disappointing for a lot of people who need someone to blame for size. Size is nothing to be ashamed of and there are tons of ways to increase sensitivity. Circumcision has medical reasons for men. My husband had to be circumcised as a teenager because of his head not being able to come out of the foreskin i forget what its called but it caused a ton of pain and he had to deal with a ton of pain as a result of the later in life circumcision. I made the choice to prevent that happening to my son because disorders like that are genetic.",

Don\u2019t work there.\n\n\nSo you think men have a force field around them that prevents them from being attacked when they aren\u2019t paying attention? Also, you do need to be aware.

Girls have different reactions and symptoms but we use the template we use for men because we assume everyone is the same. \n\n\nFair enough. I concede.\n\n\nFemale circumcision type one, as I said before but you seemed to ignore, is the same as male circumcision. It cuts off the hood of the clit. \n\n\nYou actually just tried to defend circumcision and you did it to your son. Wow. I thought if you wanted equality, you\u2019d at least admit circumcision is a barbaric practice done on literal babies with the excuse of medical purposes. But no. You mutilated your son. You cut his foreskin off and removed 30% of the sexual sensation he would\u2019ve felt otherwise. His penis will become shriveled because his foreskin isn\u2019t constantly lubricating it. He\u2019s gonna develop a callas from rubbing the head of his penis against his clothes. You claim you want equality when you\u2019re part of the problem, you\u2019re part of the reason men have less rights than women in the first place. And the worst part is, you forced your son to be a victim of it. But you\u2019re still gonna claim it was medically necessary. Because it doesn\u2019t affect you and you don\u2019t wanna believe you tortured your son. All it matters to you is whether you prefer cut or uncut. \n\n\nWhat your husband had is called phimosis. You can use creams to get rid of it. There\u2019s no need to mutilate your genitals. Your husband got scammed into ruining his sex life.",

And nothing was ruined there are several studies that show the little to no difference between circumcised and intact men. Thats from men who were circumcised later in life.

Both circumcised and uncircumcised men can get yeast infections but uncircumcised men pose the biggest risk to their fertility. Because particles can get trapped and we dont teach young men how to properly care for themselves. With most stds as well. \n\nWe as a society put so much pressure on women to clean themselves we even put harmful products on the shelves and tell young girls they should use them. Douce and ph balancing anything is actually really harmful and is likely to cause a bacterial infection than to rid one. \n\nAlso something they dont tell anyone but vaginas are acidic. If you dont clean yourself after sex it can cause a whole litany of issues. I mean for guys and its not because the vagina was dirty but because vaginal secretions are acidic. \n\n\nBut we dont support young men the same way. All too often i have heard of men who are uncomfortable touching themselves to clean and its just so bad for over all well being. Not just physically but mentally as well. We have put so much pressure on men to be *mEn* that we dont even tell them its ok to clean themselves. \n\n\nGod dont even get me started on those poor young men in the bible belt where natural feelings and actions are a pariah \n\nHonestly if it wasnt for the childs best interest all procedures should be outlawed. Seriously all of them including ear piercing. Thats so barbaric. If you could shield your child from all the pain in the world wouldnt you? Shouldn\u2019t you?
