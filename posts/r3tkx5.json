The reason I ask is that I'm a biologist and I know that most of the insect orders end in optera - Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps), Coleoptera (beetles), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Orthoptera (grasshoppers), Neuroptera (Lacewings) etc. I only vaguely know a few Latin words through biology, but I'm guessing Helicopter comes from helix and ptera, which must mean spiral wing. I feel like the O is some sort of Latin grammar joining thing. Totally guessing though! I'd never noticed the wing root in helicopter, but it makes sense as soon as I saw your comment!",

Orange (the fruit) in Modern France comes from \"Arancia\" while the city Orange comes from Arausio. \n\nCan I say for sure that the city didn't influence the word or vice-versa? No, I'm not that smart or knowledgeable. But, initially, they had no relation.",

However, Bitter Oranges do seem Native to West China and Northeast India from what I'm reading here. Additionally, different species of Oranges came from different areas. The Bitter Orange is the types of Oranges that were introduced to Europe in the 10th Century. It wasn't until the Portuguese visited (I believe) China in the 1500s that Europeans started using Sweet Oranges.\n\nEven so, the Sanskrit word does come from Tamil. But, Tamil is a different language from Hindi. Even if they do have a lot of overlapping words.",

It begins in Phoenicia. Phoenicians adopted Egyptian Hieroglyphs and modified them for common writing and their language. This writing system was adapted by other Canaanite groups such as the Israelites, who modified it into Proto-Hebrew writing. It was also adopted by the Armaics, a non-Caananite Semitic group related to both the Arabs and the Canaanites. From the Armaics, it spread into Arabia and slowly became Arab Script.\n\nAnyway, with that aside, the Phoenician writing system also spread to non-Semitic groups through trade. Most notably, it spread to the Greeks. And in Greece, it slowly evolved into the Modern Greek alphabet. Then the East Romans spread the Greek Alphabet to the Russians. The Russians adapted to their own language and it became Cyrillic.\n\nTherefore, this is how Egyptian Hieroglyphs were modified into a writing system before being exported and changed into Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets/writing systems.",

Just variations on 'black' (red-black v green-black). Wine would be one of the few dark coloured liquids available for the metaphor. \n\nOther theories are more about the translation, and that it possibly referee to the sea being drunk (Ie stormy).",

We have had three cones in our eye for as long as we have been homo-sapiens. Though it was a wide spreed belief for a long time since old written works would describe the sky as green and the sea as red. \n\nYou see, before we had a word for the color blue or orange, we just saw it as green/red and had a harder time separating the two. If a person dosen\u2019t have a word for blue, than it is hard quantify the difference between a blue flower and it\u2019s green leafs. The could still see that the peddles of the flower are different they would both be considered shades of green to them. \n\nThe words for different shades almost always come into a language in the same order and we are not really sure why. It goes 1. Dark/Black and White/Light, 2 Red, 3 Green, 4. Yellow, 5. Blue, then orange, purple and brown.  Apparently, there are still rare languages that never made a word for anything beyond dark and light in Africa and Papa New Genie. \n\nOne of the few languges that had a color for blue before green is Japanese. Japan didn\u2019t have a word that separated green from blue till western contact. Here is a [YouTube](https://youtu.be/D1-WuBbVe2E) video talking in more detail about color and language and [here ](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/japans-blue-traffic-lights-reveal-an-interesting-linguistic-quirk/) is a interesting site about why the traffic lights are blue, yellow and red in Japan.",

Cultures differ wildly in what they consider to be distinct colors and it\u2019s often a source of mild culture shock. There\u2019s really an infinite range of colors and how many names you assign is arbitrary, as well as which names encompass other names. In English speaking cultures we usually consider red and orange to be totally separate colors but cyan and navy to both be subtypes of blue. If you look at a [color wheel](https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F37%2F2020%2F10%2F19%2Fcolor-wheel-db62df1a.jpg) most English speakers would say it has three blues but one yellow. Those three blue segments are just as distinct from each other as the three opposing segments that most people would call red, orange, and yellow, but we call all three blue. Other cultures might do the exact opposite and lump that entire quarter in as orange but give a different name to each of the blues. Asian cultures traditionally didn\u2019t distinguish blue and green the same way we do, and instead lumped the darker blues in with purple, and the lighter blues on with green. If you asked for a blue shirt through a translator you might get a mint one or a lavender one. Specifying blue as a distinct color point between them was like specifying chartreuse today.",

Similarly, some Celtic languages use a term meaning \"whitish red\": gwynnrudh in Cornish, b\u00e1ndearg in Irish, bane-yiarg in Manx, b\u00e0n-dhearg in Scottish Gaelic (which also uses liath-dhearg \"greyish/pale red\" and pinc from English). In Icelandic, the color is called bleikur, originally meaning \"pale\".\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink)\n\nseems like the writing is on the wall, and the writing is both light red and pink at the same time\n\n>In the Japanese language, the traditional word for pink, momo-iro (\u3082\u3082\u3044\u308d), takes its name from the peach blossom. There is a separate word for the color of the cherry blossom: sakura-iro. In recent times a word based on the English version, pinku (\u30d4\u30f3\u30af), has begun to be used.  \n>  \n>In Chinese, the color pink is named with a compound noun \u7c89\u7d05\u8272, meaning \"powder red\" where the powder refers to substances used for women's make-up.  \n>  \n>The Thai word for the color, \u0e0a\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e39 (chom-puu), derives ultimately from Sanskrit \u091c\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0942 (jamb\u016b) \"rose apple\".",

The French word, in turn, comes from Old Proven\u00e7al auranja, based on Arabic n\u0101ranj. In several languages, the initial n present in earlier forms of the word dropped off because it may have been mistaken as part of an indefinite article ending in an n sound\u2014in French, for example, une norenge may have been heard as une orenge",

The color had been described roundabout. \n\nLike we might call water *blue-green* without a simpler word that would describe that color, maybe *cyan* or *turquoise*.\n\n> Early in the 16th century Portuguese traders brought sweet oranges from India to Europe, and the color takes its name from them. **Until they arrived, there was no orange as such in the color spectrum**. When the first Europeans saw the fruit they were incapable of exclaiming about its brilliant orange color. They **recognized the color but didn\u2019t yet know its name**. Often they referred to oranges as \u201cgolden apples.\u201d Not until they knew them as oranges did they see them as orange. (...)\n\n> But none of this actually gets us to color. Only the fruit does that. Only **when the sweet oranges began to arrive in Europe and became visible on market stalls and kitchen tables did the name of the fruit provide the name for the color**. No more \u201cyellow-red.\u201d Now there was orange. And, remarkably, within a few hundred years it was possible to forget in which direction the naming went. People could imagine that the fruit was called an orange simply because it was. [Source](https://lithub.com/color-or-fruit-on-the-unlikely-etymology-of-orange/)",

Like a person who spoke a language you mentioned that doesn't differentiate between blue and green would have a harder time *seeing* the difference between, say, cyan and turquoise.\n\nEven more stunning for me is pink, though. Pink is not really a distinct color (it's lightish red), so it is either a late edition to a language or never named at all. People who speak those languages take longer to distinguish between shades of pink and shades of red, whereas English speakers notice the difference almost *immediately*. \n\n(Also, this holds true for any language- whatever specific color distinctions they make would cause them to be better at noticing differences in shades of that color. I just focused on English vs. Non-English because a good portion of reddit speaks the former.)",

The end of our lives are usually the worst parts of them for everybody involved, and I'd expect most people wouldn't want that to be a big thing people remember about their life, if they even want it remembered at all. \n\nLike, it's been years since my grandmother died, but whenever talk about her comes at family gatherings the conversation inevitably is mostly composed of her death and her illness shortly before it. I don't want to remember her like that, and I doubt she wanted that either. I choose to remember her for things like how great Sunday dinners were with practically the whole family crammed in her house, for how kids all over the neighborhood called her grandma too because she volunteered at the elementary school, or for how much fun she was to play card games with because she was so bad at bluffing.",

He was playing around with home fermentation & distillation as a hobby at the time, and he joked around about going blind and dying from it on one of their shows. So that was the rumor after the news first broke, that he died from methanol poisoning from improper home distillation. Improperly made moonshine, basically. That\u2019s probably what you heard, or maybe some variation of it. But it\u2019s not true.\n\nThat news was really rough though. I felt it in my gut when saw that headline. WKUK had just made a comeback when he died. I hope they continue on but I just don\u2019t know how likely that is.",

The study you're referencing indicated that Russians distinguished the different shades of blue 10% faster, which is a pretty meagre difference. I'm also not convinced that the cause is actually linguistic, but rather cultural. In other words, I think the language came to describe a difference that was already there; Russian developed a division of blue into separate words because the distinct shades were used more, and the marginally faster recognition is a reflection of familiarity that comes with using those shades more.  Regardless, English speakers could still distinguish the shades. I don't think there's evidence to support the idea that language actually changes perception.",

I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s the same thing with orange and red before orange was name as such.",

I'm not saying perception isn't effected by language, just that variations in color aren't erased because of it.",

There is a [very specific and essentially universal order](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_term) in which colors are \u201cnamed\u201d in languages. Purple would probably be called \u201cblack\u201d (or \u201cdark\u201d) until \u201cblue\u201d is defined, which is one of the middle colors. \u201cPurple\u201d is one of the last colors to receive a distinct name. This doesn\u2019t mean that the color can\u2019t be \u201cseen\u201d, it just doesn\u2019t really have a name, so it gets called essentially \u201cdark\u201d or \u201cblue\u201d.\n\nThis phenomenon exists in English, too: what color is the sky? Blue? Some languages, most notably Russian, have a term for what we tend to call \u201clight blue\u201d or \u201csky blue\u201d, which is a distinct color from blue: azure. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t see what color the sky is, we just call it \u201cblue\u201d like we call royal blue \u201cblue\u201d.\n\nAnother fun fact, what we call \u201cblue\u201d (a true, royal blue) was actually called \u201cindigo\u201d by Newton, who defined the seven colors of the rainbow. What he called \u201cblue\u201d is actually that same azure color that has a distinct name in Russian.",

The earliest recorded use of orange the fruit in English is from the 1300s and came to us from the Old French orenge, adapted from the Arabic n\u0101ranj, from the Persian n\u0101rang, from the Sanskrit n\u0101ranga (\"orange tree\"). The Sanskrit word's origin is unclear, but it might come from a Dravidian word meaning \"fragrant.\"\n\nThe word's use as a color name doesn't crop up for another 200 years, in the early 1500s. English speakers probably didn't have a specific name for the color until the fruit was widely available in their markets and inspired one. Before then, linguists believe people generally referred to orange as \"yellow-red,\" \u0121eolur\u0113ad in Old English.\n\nhttps://www.mentalfloss.com/article/29942/which-came-first-orange-color-or-orange-fruit",

      "text": "#1. Blueberries \n\nThere aren\u2019t too many authentically blue species in nature, which is why they\u2019re both prized, and tend to be named after their hue. After all, we have bluebirds, bluebells\u2026 and of course, blueberries. We get the word \u201cblue\u201d from the old Saxon blao (rhymes with \u201cnow\u201d) and this fruit\u2019s naming history must have been quite self explanatory.\n\n#2. Peaches\n\nThese fruit trees are native to China, and were introduced to Persia a couple of thousand years ago. It was there that they were given the name persis, in reference to their color. This evolved to persica in Latin, then pesche in Old French, until it got to its current moniker.\n\n\n#3. Blackberries\n\nBlackberries are in the same boat (or dish?) as blueberries as far as where they got their name. Basically, they\u2019re berries that are black. We get the word \u201cblack\u201d from the Old Norse blakkr, which evolved into bl\u00e6c in Old English. In fact, if you take a look at the 12th century word blaceberian, you can see how there was just a tiny hop to the modern name we know and love. \n\n#4. Ruby Grapefruit\n\nRubies are some of the rarest precious gems on the planet, and only form when aluminum atoms in the Earth get replaced by chromium during the gems\u2019 compression process. Interestingly, ruby grapefruits also developed thanks to mineral-based mutation. Grapefruits only had bitter, pale pink-yellow flesh until they started being cultivated in Texas in the 1920s. Something in the soil there turned the flesh ruby red, and sweetened it exponentially.\n\n#5. Cherries\n\nThese luscious fruits got their name from the 12th century French word cerise, which in turn came from the late Greek word kerasian. Now, this might be a chicken or the egg scenario when it comes to fruits named after colors. This is because we\u2019re not entirely sure whether the word for this particular red hue was named for the fruit, or vice versa. At least we can agree that cherries are magnificent, and worth devouring whenever possible.\n\n#6. Oranges\n\nLast but certainly not least are oranges. Instead of this fruit being named after a color, we got the name for the color orange from the fruit. Isn\u2019t that fascinating? The word \u201corange\u201d evolved from the Sanskrit word naranj, referring to the tree that creates these fabulous fruits. \n\n\n[My Source](https://thrivecuisine.com/fruits/6-fruits-named-after-colors/)",

In Tamil, the word \u0101ra\u00f1cu translates to \"6 and 5\" implying 11. Oranges typically have 11 individual pieces and were named accordingly. Additionally, in Tamil, the root\u00a0nurga\u00a0translates to fragrant.\n\nSo the interpretative translation of the word applied to the fruit is \"eleven fragrant segments\".\n\nHowever the word n\u0101ra\u1e45ga was also used to describe the color orange... so you are completely correct.\n\nThe word N\u0101ra\u1e45ga\u00a0reached European languages through Persian (n\u0101rang) and\u00a0Arabic\u00a0(n\u0101ranj)\u00a0variations of the term. The word \u2018orange\u2019 first appeared in the English language in the 12th century. It is thought to have come via the Old French word\u00a0orenge.\u00a0It is unclear if\u00a0orenge\u00a0derived directly from Persian or Arabic, or if it was calqued from the Italian word used for orange tree,\u00a0arancio.\n\nRegardless the word orange evolved from the original sanskrit word n\u0101ra\u1e45ga which was used to describe both the fruit and the color.",

Given no other information, if someone said they were bringing raspberries to a picnic, would you thinking there's a high likelihood of them bringing a colour other than red?  That's similar to suggesting that if someone said \"I'd like milk with my tea\" that *given no other information* you'd think it's equally likely that they meant oat milk as opposed to cow milk.\n\nUsing the term \"raspberry\" in general discussion, with no other context, to most people, would mean the red variety.\n\nThe irony of this all is that the word \"raspberry\" may even come from the word *raspise* \"a sweet **rose-colored** wine\".

The answer is\u2026neither.\n\n> The linguistic ancestor to today\u2019s word \u201corange\u201d was actually first used to describe the\u00a0tree\u00a0that the fruit grows on. The word\u2019s roots can be traced all the way back to Sanskrit.

Based on survival, we need water before we need food, and if a body of water is large enough, or is clear enough, it will reflect the sky and turn blue, meaning we came up with the concept of blue and green before we came up with the concept of red or purple.\n\nYou could also apply this to the sky, meaning we saw the sky and said \"call that colour blue!\" (we did the same when it was night, but with black instead).\n\nHowever, things like oranges are one of the first things in nature you see that are orange, aside from tigers but at that point you are running the fuck away, so we named the fruit and then the colour after the fruit\n\nDon't take this seriously tho, this is me going on a tangent",

The earliest recorded use of orange the fruit in English is from the 1300s and came to us from the Old French orenge, adapted from the Arabic n\u0101ranj, from the Persian n\u0101rang, from the Sanskrit n\u0101ranga (\"orange tree\"). The Sanskrit word's origin is unclear, but it might come from a Dravidian word meaning \"fragrant.\"\n\nThe word's use as a color name doesn't crop up for another 200 years, in the early 1500s. English speakers probably didn't have a specific name for the color until the fruit was widely available in their markets and inspired one. Before then, linguists believe people generally referred to orange as \"yellow-red,\" \u0121eolur\u0113ad in Old English.\"\n\nhttps://www.mentalfloss.com/article/29942/which-came-first-orange-color-or-orange-fruit",

Pumpkins not sure if they were before or after, but likely after. \n\nSaffron was one of the few orange coloured foods known to the English before the orange. But the name had to be easily pronounceable as to replace the existing term for the colour \u2018yellow-red\u2019. So plenty of other contenders likely didn\u2019t roll off the tongue as well.\n\nBasically we\u2019re mostly talking about English and so it mostly has to do with when certain foods made it to / were popularized in England. Also we know better what the more elite people called certain colours because they were the ones being written about.\n\nI believe (without being an expert) orange in India was/is commonly referred to as saffron. It\u2019s just as likely we could have ended up referring to orange as saffron in English if it wasn\u2019t for the preferences of a few English nobles for the word orange.",

(Pumpkins are from the Americas and thus not discovered yet). \n\nThe orange fruit was believed to originate in China, and once taken to India the fruit was called naranga. Coming to Spain then the rest of Europe, the fruit's name became Spainish-naranja, French-orange, English- orange, Durch-oranje, German-orange, Italian-arancia, Portuguese- laranja. \n\nIn all those languages, the new color was made the same.

Off the top of my head green apples, red currants, white peaches, and ruby grapefruits.\n\nThings that may follow the same fruit-before-color scheme as oranges include peaches, cherries, apricots, watermelons, and plums.\n\nActually fruit and color share a very strong, uncharacteristically synaesthetic bond. There's a strong complimentary argument that the primary adaptive function of color vision is to aid us in gathering food. Carnivores tend to have vision highly adapted to sensing motion, contrast, and low light, whereas omnivores and herbivores tend to express much more color sensitivity.\n\nI think saying\n>Blueberries are the only fruit named after a color\n\nis so remarkably untrue that it's almost a test to see how little independent thought the people you're talking to are able to muster within the space of the social dynamic you are in.",

Like the color is named after the fruit\n\n>In English, the colour orange is named after the appearance of the ripe orange fruit.[3] The word comes from the Old French: orange, from the old term for the fruit, pomme d'orange. The French word, in turn, comes from the Italian arancia,[4][5] based on Arabic n\u0101ranj (\u0646\u0627\u0631\u0646\u062c), borrowed from Persian naarang derived from Sanskrit n\u0101ra\u1e45ga (\u0928\u093e\u0930\u0919\u094d\u0917), which in turn derives from a Dravidian root word (compare \u0ba8\u0bb0\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bcd/\u0d28\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19 narandam/naranja which refers to bitter orange in Tamil and Malayalam).[6] The earliest known recorded use of orange as a colour name in English was in 1502, in a description of clothing purchased for Margaret Tudor.[7][8] Another early recorded use was in 1512,[9][10] in a will now filed with the Public Record Office. The place-name \"Orange\" has a separate etymology and is not related to that of the colour.[11]\n\n>Before this word was introduced to the English-speaking world, saffron already existed in the English language.[12] Crog also referred to the saffron colour, so that orange was also referred to as \u0121eolur\u0113ad (yellow-red) for reddish orange, or \u0121eolucrog (yellow-saffron) for yellowish orange.[13][14][15] Alternatively, orange things were sometimes described as red such as red deer, red hair, the Red Planet and robin redbreast.",

In India the colour orange is known as saffron, and it was sometimes referred to as the same in England. The first known use of orange as a colour came after the fruit arrived when a dress was described as \u2018orange coloured\u2019. The fruit is more or less known as a word similar to orange even in countries that don\u2019t use the word for the colour.",
