We ended up having an argument on the internet about something completely unrelated and because I disagreed with her and defended myself when she started calling me names she decided it was appropriate to say I was somehow a rapist. Ofcourse this was just something she probably said to piss me off but I shudder to think if I had ever been alone with her even for a moment anywhere if she would have outright made an actual false accusation against me.

Look at Female leaders. Indhira Gandhi is enough of an example. \n\nThey are also claiming women suffer more than men going to war. What kind of delusions are these? Men who goes to wars gets killed, loses their limps and gets tortured. Women getting raped is when men lose the war and die out.

A words meaning doesn't change because of people who like call themselves that word. The official meaning of the word feminism is the social, economical,  personal and political equality of the sexes.  \n\nAnd everyone who doesn't behave to achieve this goal isn't a feminist Idc if they like to call themselves that.
