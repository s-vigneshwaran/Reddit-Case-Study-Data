A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?\n\nEinstein thought this problem could be solved. It can, but not until human labor is obsolete. Until then, attempts to concentrate all power in the government to achieve socialism will lead to despotism, censorship, vicious power struggles, as well as shitty material conditions - just as they have in all of the experiments in socialism we ran in the 20th century.\n\nWhy do you ignore the results of history? It's clear what happens when the government has ALL of the power.",

Contrary to what you say, it does not require human labour to be obsolete before it can work.\n\nI do not ignore the results of history. They are invaluable to learn from. However, I think those \"results\" of which you speak have been grossly misrepresented by capitalists and twisted into anti-communist propaganda. So you should meticulously inspect your prior assumptions and conclusions... For example, if you're thinking of the USSR or China, keep in mind both countries were mostly pre-industrial and populated mostly by peasants when they had their Communist revolutions. They industrialized and vastly improved the material conditions of their people over the course of their histories. Literacy, health care, life expectancy, etc. all went up under Communism rule.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nReading List:\n\n* Why Socialism?

Stalin, although holding wide powers, was merely captain of a team and Krushchev will be the new captain. However, it does not appear that any of the present leaders will rise to the stature of Lenin and Stalin, so that it will be safer to assume that development in Moscow will be along the lines of what is called collective leadership, unless Western policies force the Soviets to streamline their power organization. The present situation is the most favorable from the point of view of upsetting the Communist dictatorship since the death of Stalin.\r  \n\r  \nSource: [https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A006000360009-0.pdf](https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A006000360009-0.pdf) \n\nRashism is *post* Communist Russia... that's a symptom of *Capitalism*, not Communism.
