Your position, which amounts to mere right-wing ideology, flies in the face of the available scientific evidence. I will address some of your statements below.\n\n___\n\n> Like the claim that people can be attrected to multiple people is defensible.\n>\n> Of course everyone has seen more than 1 person whose body they liked\n\nHopefully it is evident to you that these statements are contradictory. \n\nRegarding the second one, you are acknowledging that everyone sexually desires multiple people, yet, by supporting institutionalized monogamy, you seek to preclude people's maximal sexual fulfillment. Again, this is irrational. The purpose of institutions is to fulfill people's needs, not to militate against their fulfillment.\n\n___\n\n> What do you think monogamy came to existence from?**Evolution**.\n\nAbsolutely not. All [biological determinist](https://www.britannica.com/topic/biological-determinism) claims\u2014which, again, merely serve a right-wing [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_functionalism)\u2014are unsupported by reliable science. This applies as much to psychosexual traits as it does to things like intelligence and personality. As I explain [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q3s9ia/what_job_or_activity_do_you_normally_associate/hfv3j8w/):\n\n> To be sure, there is no reliable scientific evidence that psychological traits have particular genetic underpinnings that are consistent across individuals. On the contrary, the available evidence shows that these traits (e.g., [self-concept](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept), [emotions](http://www.sonic.net/~cr2/emotion.htm), [color perception](http://www.sonic.net/~cr2/colors.htm), motivation, sexuality) derive their concrete features from sociocultural and political-economic (environmental) factors . . . . Biology merely serves as a general potentiating substratum for psychology and does not determine (or even \"influence\") specific outcomes; differential psychological outcomes in a population are attributable to variations in social experience rather than genetic variation.\n\nKeep in mind that evolutionary psychology, whose rhetoric you are parroting here, is a biological determinist theoretical orientation. As cultural psychologist Carl Ratner observes in [*Macro Cultural Psychology: A Political Philosophy of Mind*](https://www.amazon.com/Macro-Cultural-Psychology-Political-Philosophy/dp/0195373545), it is indefensible:\n\n> It takes **thousands of generations for genetic changes** to accumulate via a sufficient number of organisms\u2019 out-reproducing other organisms **to produce a new morphology**. Yet humans have produced **only 100 generations since the founding of the Roman Empire**; this is not enough time for new morphology to genetically evolve. And human **behavioral change does not involve morphological changes in genes, neurotransmitters, or cortical structures**, which obviates genetic evolution\u2019s pertinence to human behavior at all. **Naturalistic theories** of human psychology **such as evolutionary psychology are false**.\n>\n> (p. 89, bold added)\n\nConcerning monogamy specifically, as I discuss [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SexPositive/comments/sy44c0/parallels_between_institutionalized_monogamy_and/):\n\n> Sexual customs and attitudes, of course, are no exception to the laws of history, as Engels explicates in [*The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm), which details the historical development of said customs from the earliest human societies and their \"primitive state of promiscuous intercourse,\" in which there was an \"absence of any restriction imposed by custom on sexual intercourse\" and \"unrestricted sexual freedom prevailed [even between siblings, as well as parents and their offspring] . . . every woman belonging equally to every man and every man to every woman\"; through group marriages, \"the form of family in which whole groups of men and whole groups of women mutually possess one another,\" which prohibited sexual interactions between individuals of the same [gens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gens_\\(anthropology\\)); and, finally, to monogamy, which coincided with the [accumulation of private wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_accumulation_of_capital#Primitive_accumulation_and_privatization), replaced the matrilineal gens system with a patrilineal system of inheritance, established the patriarchal nuclear family, and today remains as the dominant, formally instituted and informally sanctioned form of sexual relations.\n> \n> . . .\n>\n> . . . in light of the above, it is fairly clear that sex-negative norms are merely *ad hoc* rationalizations whose [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_functionalism) or *raison d'\u00eatre* is actually to help preserve a society's economic well-being\u2014in other words, their moralistic justifications, which all but never incorporate economic concerns, cannot be taken at face value. This is particularly evident when considering the class nature of the observance of monogamy norms, some examples of which are offered by Engels:\n> \n> ___\n> > . . . **hetaerism [i.e., the practice, coexistent with monogamous marriage, of sexual intercourse between men and unmarried women outside marriage]** is as much a social institution as any other; it continues the old sexual freedom . . . . Actually, not merely tolerated but **gaily practised by the ruling classes** particularly, **it is condemned in words**.\n> >\n> > (Ibid., bold added)\n> ___\n> > . . . though **marriage was held in great reverence** \u2013 \u2018they content themselves with one wife, the women live hedged round with chastity\u2019 \u2013 **polygamy was the rule for the distinguished members and the leaders of the tribe** . . .\n> >\n> > (Ibid., bold added)\n> ___\n> \n> What we see here is a situation in which the masses are conditioned or otherwise forced to obey the sex-negative monogamy custom, while individuals of high status enjoy the sexual privilege that was afforded to all during the abovementioned primitive state of promiscuous intercourse.\n\nNot only has polyamory been the norm for the vast majority of humanity's existence, but even in monogamous societies\u2014which only formed some 10,000 years ago, after wealth began to accumulate in private hands\u2014polyamory was recognized as a privilege enjoyed by only a select few, while the masses were forced to make do with just one sexual partner. Indeed, this is consistent with the fact that many primates formerly thought to be strictly monogamous actually frequently \"cheat\" on their cohabitating partners. Your claim contradicts all psychological, as well as both cultural and physical anthropological, evidence. This can only mean that, again, it is made-up, indefensible claptrap. \n\n___\n\n> it's not like there's any big difference between 1 person's body and another, it's the same structure, just different qualities.\n\nYou're kind of contradicting yourself again. The different qualities between people, however subtle, make all the difference. \n\nConsider that repeated masturbation to the same porn video or image becomes less pleasurable after each instance. This is due to satiation. The same applies to particular foods, beverages, recreational activities, etc. Humans are most fulfilled by and thrive best on variety. \n\n___\n\n> Lastly, it's not even possible to have proper intimate relationships with multiple people(because of obvious human limitations)\n\nI think these \"limitations\" you reference are more made-up stuff. \n\n___\n\n> if everybody fucks multiple people that special relationship amounts to nothing more than a close friendship.\n\nEven if true, so what? This doesn't preclude having multiple special, unique, fulfilling sexual relationships.\n\nPsychology, including desires, is fundamentally cultural. This means that particular desires are, in a sense, more or less arbitrary. You are arguing for a society in which people desire \"special\" relationships with only a single person\u2014which, like all cultural desires, is unnecessary\u2014but are unable to fulfill their sexual desires with others. People would be much more fulfilled in a polyamorous society lacking the desire you promote.\n\n___\n\n> This should be common sense\n\nThat's just it. Your views come from your own common\u2014that is, [ethnocentric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnocentrism) and unscientific\u2014sense. They are purely impressionistic and not at all backed by objective data.\n\n___\n\n> why the fk is it your problem what other people choose to do.\n\nIn my initial comment, I specified that I am opposed to *institutionalized* monogamy. I have no problem with the rare individuals who independently decide to pursue monogamous relationships.\n\n___\n\n> No one stops you from being a whore.Just stop trying to force your lifestyle onto everyone else\n>\n> If you have a high sex drive and questionable morals and want to live life like a whore, limiting love to sex, that's your choice, please, don't try to force me into doing the same.\n\nI'm a guy lmaoo",
