We as females feel uncomfortable when we sit in a public place and half of our seats are occupied by men spreading their legs so wide.** A female would be asked to sit properly even if we were wearing a pair of jeans . I think males should sit closed legs to make people sitting beside them comfortable. **This is part of tackling the societal norms and addressing gender discrimination.**\n\nhttps://www.empowerwomen.org/en/community/discussions/2017/06/when-manspreading-becomes-a-problem-for-females\n\n- Woman Attacks Manspreaders' Crotches With Bleach in Viral Video\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/viral-video-against-manspreading-splashes-commuters-crotches-bleach-solution-1138930\n\n- Manspreading: Why We Do It and Why We Need to Stop\n\nI suspect the reason men do this is very simple: we think we should. Sitting with knees together and legs in tight is a sign of weakness or homosexuality - both social death, of course. So with this overbearing sense of self-consciousness, we have somehow decided that 'legs akimbo' is the norm.\n\nhttps://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/the-guyliner/manspreading-masculinity_b_6254498.html\n\nFYI (yet again) From the first page of a simple google search...\n\nYou were saying????\n\n>But this is intentionally short sited and a hateful dialog that doesn't achieve anything except make people like yourself angry. \n\n**Feminists, women, and their white knight defenders (like you?) need to stop holding men to standards they're personally and collectively unwilling to meet.**\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Feminism today is a monolithic ideology demanding conformity in its pursuit of painting women as weak perpetual victims who can't handle facts, objective reality, or personal agency.*",

Why? Why can't they decide how they sit?\n\nBut then there will be woman spreading so it doesn't solve the problem\n\nAnd they actually spend money to do these things, meanwhile in the middle east and places like that women and lgbtq people don't have rights",
