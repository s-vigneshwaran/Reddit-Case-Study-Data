You have no choice. I will take away your job if you don\u2019t. I will put you in a camp if you don\u2019t. I will ban you from grocery stores if you don\u2019t. I will treat you like a second class citizen if you don\u2019t. I will kick your children out of school if you don\u2019t. Please try to stay on topic. The majority of the population does not have to worry about catching stds that is usually just raunchy people, sex workers, and drug addicts. \n\nNow try to look at it this way, if you are always going to use a condom, why get my vaccine??? \ud83e\udd2f the condom kills two birds with one stone right?",

Wearing a mask makes more sense, but even that is not effective without proper material and fitting on your face. \nI had covid in Oct. I work from home with no exposure to others except a wedding I attended earlier that week. I would guess 90% of attendees were Dr's, nurses and medical staff that were all vaccinated...and I'm sure most of the others were also vaccinated. \nI was fine within a week, and back to normal in a month (water and sleep)...same with half my friends (not vaccinated and all have been fine).

The vaccine decreased symptoms immensely to the point where vaccinated people are an order of magnitude less likely to need hospitalization. \n\nThere is NEVER a black and white in biology/pathology. You have cancer right now. Your body is just decent at killing it before it becomes a problem. We don't actually say \"you have cancer\" until the cancer becomes a problem. \n\nThe vaccine makes it much harder for the virus to become a problem. It can still enter your body, and reproduce, but your body will be much better equipped to stop it. Because it has a harder time it also makes it harder to build up enough numbers to spread so you are less able to spread it.",

Most humans don\u2019t have sex for 1 year then stop. \n\nSo, if your bc method is, say 99% effective, that\u2019s great odds over 1 year. But if you use the same method year after year, with an independent 1% chance of pregnancy each year, then over the course of 25 years you have greater than a 1 in 5 chance of getting pregnant. That\u2019s with perfect use every day for more than 2 decades, which is a lot to ask of a human.\n\nMirena, when inserted correctly (which is up to the doctor, not the user, and something like 5-10% of insertions aren\u2019t actually correct) has a cumulative failure rate of .7% over 5 years. If we follow that over 5 replacements, so a total of 25 years, approximately 1 in 29 women will get pregnant at some point.\n\nAll of this is just to say: don\u2019t blame people who gave unplanned pregnancies. If you\u2019re lucky enough to never have one, recognize that even if you did everything exactly right, luck was certainly a factor. Even the most perfect people simply cannot have sex with 0 risk of pregnancy, that\u2019s not how human bodies or birth control methods work.",

It\u2019s a small chance, but even a combination of methods that is 99.99% effective will result in 1 of every 10,000 couples getting pregnant. Think about an NFL stadium, and realize that if you filled it with couples who used 2 forms of birth control perfectly, 3-5 of them would be pregnant within the year. Not bad odds, but those few couples are going to have done everything they could and still wind up pregnant.\n\nIt\u2019s the reason it\u2019s so important to protect abortion rights.

I don't know if she actually was being racist or not, I don't care. If the married couple really was as happy with each other as they claim, they'd have no need to follow her around harassing her on other subs and making themselves look trashy for everyone here. But they did, so the first moment the husband followed the woman here, she should have said \"This is batshit insane behavior, I'm blocking you.\" And done so. The moment the wife joined in, she should have told her the same thing and done so. Instead all of them succumbed to childish and crude name-calling, and all three ended up looking like immature little children screaming at each other on the playground. Frankly, \"trashy\" is the nicest word I've got for all three of their behaviors here.\n\nEdit: u/Lord-Babbled , u/magicunicornfarts and to a lesser extent u/_clash_recruit_ for engaging with them are all trashy and disgusting. What I read in their comments was all personal attacks about parenting methods, eating habits, and other things that have absolutely nothing to do with anything beyond \"I want to make you feel like shit about yourself because I'm a worthless piece of shit human being. If you kill yourself because I managed to hit on the right insecurity, I'm going to giggle as I masturbate to thoughts of your dead body because that's what kind of person I am!\" \n\nAnd I'm tagging them, not because I want to pick a fight, but because I believe in being honest and telling them to their digital faces that they're all rude and disgusting assholes from what I've seen. I don't like talking badly about people where they won't see. And if any of them try their bullshit name-calling childishness on me, I'll do what all of them should have done in the first place and not engage/block them.",

It was only very recently (the last 50 years) that a woman could get a credit card. So it comes that Millennials and Gen X to an extent were really the first generation where women could be their own person and men actually had to care about a woman's feelings leaving Boomers very detached from how the world works",

It helps if you consider that the world was very different during the childhood of boomers, and even more different for their parents. \n\nThe world didn't change so quickly in the past, and so it was expected that you passed your knowledge onto your children, and they would do the same. There wasn't room or need for the children to know more than their parents at any point, even in adulthood. It was \"this is how life works\", that's it. When change or innovation happened, it happened slowly, and it was usually concrete enough that you could easily demonstrate its value (new tool, etc). \"Knowledge\", \"wisdom\", and traditions were passed down from parent to child in this manner for centuries, with only slight change over time, and then the industrial revolution happened and we have been on the train of progress ever since. \n\nFrom there, we didn't deal with the consequences of industrialization before the rate of technological development exploded, and boomers and their parents are the groups that got caught in the gap. Many of them adapted and led the charge that got us the technological marvels we have today, but their general population didn't keep up. They were assaulted by all kinds of bullshit back then (remember opinions from DOCTORS saying smoking was fine?), and most of them were never taught skills to sort information, leaving them with no real way to discern what would be important to learn, so they just learned the things their parents passed down to them and were left behind. \n\nIn the information age, many of us were taught in school about the ridiculousness of our parent's heyday, and how to actually verify sources etc. We were born into the tech boom, and learned how to keep up. I think later generations will be fine, but boomers unfortunately are \nthe transitional group and it's not a good time for them.",

This is not an unusual reality for many evangelicals - my wife and I were both strict, born-again evangelicals when we met, and neither of us had had sex before we got married. To me, because the very deep roots of my *id* are still anchored in the horrible soil of religious conservatism, condoms are only for preventing pregnancy. STDs are not part of my (sub?)consciousness because I can't imagine having sex with strangers whose sexual history is unknown to me. I'm sure this chucklefuck thinks the same way that my embarrassing *id* thinks, too.\n\nI realize that not everybody who promotes abstinence actually practices it, but there are those of us out there who bought into it completely. And that's fucked up. But that's also the fucked-up reason why this man would think condoms only exist to prevent pregnancy, presumably with your wife or fiancee.",

I think, from a strictly statistical point of view, the pill is sufficiently effective to be relied upon by itself to prevent pregnancy in nearly every instance, but there's certainly no harm in being extra careful. When used as intended, it has a nearly 100% effectiveness rate, although there are enough variations in human physiology to prevent it from ever being 100% effective. IUDs are even more effective, being more than 99.9% effective in some cases. \n\nBut for those other instances, it's understandable that a condom may be the best choice, although it's hard to rely on them exclusively since they have only an 85% effective rate in real-world scenarios. It's certainly better than nothing, and works extremely well in combination with other methods. But I don't think the data require that everyone double-up all the time, since some methods by themselves can achieve a virtually 100% effective rate. \n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control\n\nhttps://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-pill/how-effective-is-the-birth-control-pill\n\nhttps://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/iud/how-effective-are-iuds\n\nhttps://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/condom/how-effective-are-condoms",

My wife would be among the latter. She said it was \"really uncomfortable\" to have it put in, which I should have known to translate as *\"unbelievably bad\"* for people like me. So that would be one reason to avoid it, especially if you know that you've got a particularly sensitive nervous system. It's a shame, though: IUDs have been nothing short of a miracle for our situation, and I just really wish everybody else had the same opportunities we do.",

The reality is that they are no different than any other vaccine and in some cases more effective than some of the popular ones that we have required in schools for quite some time (such as the chickenpox vaccine).",

The number is higher in low income and third world countries due to bad medical equipment and poor living conditions. In fact 56% of the deaths are in sub Sahara African countries alone totaling 162,000. In developed countries the likelihood of dying due to child birth in a devolved country is 1:3800.",

In both cases, you decrease risk of bad thing happening more by doing both preventative measures but most people consider just doing one thing that provides 99.9% efficacy enough.",

HOWEVER, your odds of getting pregnant are drastically decreased with the use of birth control, and even more greatly decreased when using a condom. So, yes, people DO do this thing that Ben Gilroy seems to think is so horrible, for good reason, because of science and statistics proving that those things mostly prevent pregnancy. Science and statistics have proven that vaccination and wearing masks, while these things can be uncomfortable, have drastically decreased the contraction and spread of covid. He unintentionally disproved his own point within his point.",

In both cases, you decrease risk of bad thing happening more by doing both preventative measures but most people consider just doing one thing that provides 99.9% efficacy enough.",

You have a 95% chance of never even catching alpha.\n\nUnfortunately, it protects less well against variants that have mutated since then.  It looks like it only provides a 30% - 40% chance of never catching omicron.

For each contraceptive method, you're going to have both the theoretical maximum effectiveness, and the \"in practice\" real-world effectiveness that takes into account things like people not taking birth control pills at exactly the same time every day, occasionally neglecting to roll the condom down as far as it can go, etc.  Some common \"perfect\" vs \"typical\" numbers:\n\n||Perfect Use|Typical Use|\n|---|---|---|\n|IUD|99%|N/A|\n|Birth control shot|99%|94%|\n|Birth control pill|99%|91%|\n|Condom|98%|85%|\n|Pull-out method|96%|78%|\n|Rhythm method|N/A|76-88%|\n\n*Note that those percentages apply over the course of a year of having regular sex; it's not a per-encounter percentage.  So, for example, if 100 couples use the birth control pill (typical usage, not absolutely perfect usage), you'd expect on average for six of them to become pregnant over the course of one year.",
