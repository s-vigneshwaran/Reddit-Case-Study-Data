  "text": "\"That'll be $6.66.\"\nMy least favorite thing to say, working a convenience store in the Bible Belt. One of our most popular items rings up at that price too.\n\nPeople will outright leave the item at my register and refuse to buy it, forcing me to put it back. Some will go back to get something else but leave the item there, holding up the line. Others will even demand I *change the price,* some even going as far as to get a manager.\n\nIt's a fucking number. I hate it here.\n\nEDIT: I didn't think anyone would be interested in the item, but I was wrong haha. It's a 15-pack of Mountain Dew.\n\nEDIT 2: Yeah, yeah, \"just charge $6.67\". I'd absolutely do it if I had the option. Same with moving or quitting.\n\nAlso, the reason I'm bitching about having to put the case back is because it's big and my counter is small, so I have to immediately put it back. This holds up the line, which irritates the customers, and anyone who works retail knows how much harder that makes everything.",

Although they claim the \u201chigher power\u201d you\u2019re supposed to surrender to can be anything (your family, your career, whatever) the simple fact is that the group was founded with a belief in god as a basic tenet of their ideology.

Im in recovery because I made a conscious decision to change, went through the hell of withdrawals and have continued to focus on the aspects of life that bring positivity rather than falling back into the self-sabotaging behavior I used to, not because I one day woke up and decided \u201conly my higher power can save me\u201d.",

Because she has no real convictions and would rather keep her job.\n\nOh, right, this is r/atheism. She's also what I refer to as a \"convenient Christian\" in that she never prays, never goes to church, never gives any indication she's religious at all, except a couple small crucifixes in the house, EXCEPT when she wants to judge you or talk down to you. She will get legitimately ANGRY if you say \"god dammit\" or any variations thereof, and hates Gay/trans people because \"teh bible\". Also racist, but that's just because she's a boomer, no relation to religion.\n\nPoint is, religious people who believe in stupid bullshit are inclined to believe in other stupid bullshit",

Walking in you have had 0 floors of elevation change. You are on the ground floor. If you go up one floor, you have experienced one floor of elevation change. You are now on the first floor. \n\nIf you go down one floor from the ground floor, you are on the -1 floor. I believe Americans would call this B1. \n\nIf G=0, then the floor above it is 1. If G=1, then the floor above it is 2. \n\nG=0 makes sense to me because it aligns with how we do math for everything else. You don't start a highway with \"mile 1\", you start it with \"mile 0\". You aren't 1 year old at birth, you are 0 years old. \n\nG=1 probably makes sense to you because of tradition. It's natural to you because you are used to it, and there is no reason to change it, since it is pretty arbitrary.",

If it's an office building, the floor is preceded with a \"B\" and start counting higher the lower you go... so if there is a basement it's just \"B\", if there are more than 1, you'd have \"B1\" for the first floor underground, \"B2\" for the second floor underground, etc. If the sub floors are for parking, which is common, the the prefix is \"P\" instead of \"B\"...so you'd have \"P1\", \"P2\", etc.\n\nI think it'd be pretty dumb to call a floor '0' because that is not how humans naturally count. If you have 1 of a thing, then that thing is assigned the value (and name) of \"1\". If you have 2 of a thing, those things are assigned the value and names of \"1\" and \"2\". \n\nYou are familiar with how most of humanity keeps track of historical dates yeah? There's also no 'year zero'. The first year was \"year 1\". The year before that was \"1 BC\". Floors of buildings here work the same way.\n\n\"1st\" is pronounced \"first\". The \"first\" of a thing is associated with the number \"1. \"2nd\" is pronounced \"second\", and the \"second\" of a thing is associated wit the number 2. How does it make sense to have a 0th floor?

Same with moving or quitting.\n\nI would just talk to someone higher up who is Able to make price Adjustments. \n- Respect the Chain of Command. Talk to your direct Manager first. \n- Be Prepared: Thake one Week or Better a whole Month. Count every Time you need to put a 6,66 Item Back. And measure the Time it takes you. \n\"You see sir. In the Last month alone This Price tag ammounted to 100 unsatisfied customers and 666.00 Dollars in lost sales at my counter alone. In addition to me having to bring the item back a immediately, wich costs me about 90 seconds of work time every time that could be utilized way more productively. That are 2.5 Hours of work time and an additional cost of xxxx at my current wage for the company. This is not even including the loss in customer satisfaction for all the other customers that have to wait those unnecessary 90 Seconds more in the Line until I am back at the counter.\"",

I personally sacrifice hours of sleep a night and have taken out several high-interest bank loans to afford the amount of laptops I need open simultaneously in order to research different companies' products and route them to my central algorithm that calculates all the different baskets of goods at any location that total $6.66.*\n\n*My fingers are extremely fast from years of violin that I sold to afford faster internet. I don't have a job because I spend all my time tracking price fluctuations and slight tax differences in various counties based on constantly shifting local legislature. As soon as I get a match, a loud alarm goes off as GPS instructions to the store's location are sent to my phone. I have a mount on my moped to which I attach my phone - a bluetooth chip then recognizes the connection and automatically launches Google Maps by the time I pop the fucking clutch.*\n\n*I watch with glee as the cashier rings up my $6.66 order and then I mark their reactions in a small 4x6 composition notebook that I previously purchased in a combo pack along with a ballpoint pen and a coupon to bring the total in that specific OfficeMax to $6.66. If they refuse to cash me out without changing the total, they go on the list. I leave all my gas pumps on $9.99, and I go in to pay so they have to type in exactly how much I want to purchase. Just because it's upside down doesn't mean you will be safe. It breaks my heart to see that some cashiers are still actively undoing my actions and reducing the number of officially processed $6.66 transactions, thus negating the collective spell. If I need to buy anything that doesn't fit in a \"Satan's total\" basket of goods, I have a friend do it. The last time a cashier got freaked out but I adamantly insisted for several hours during peak business time that the total not be changed and everyone started to clap and of course cry even though I had delayed all of them horribly.*",

For those who don't know what that means, the exchange is the three numbers *after* the area code, so, in Maine the phone number would be (207) 666-XXXX.\n\nThe town that this effected had a very small population.  It is 788 as of 2019.  Not 788 *thousand* just seven hundred eighty-eight people, *total*.  And the exchange had been in use since the early part of the 20th century.  But we still got complaints about this on a daily basis.\n\nIn defense of the shitty company I worked for, our response was supposed to be \"I do not understand the reason for the complaint,\" and treat 666 no differently than we treated *any* three digit number.  I mean, it's not like we could change it.  Landline exchanges were tied to location.  If you wanted a new number, you had to either get a cell phone or move to a different town.",

I offered the option of using her account number and she seemed receptive. Until we reached the 666 part.

If it has some personal info on it, you should probably block that out (blur, black rectangles).  And don't forget to read the image rules on /r/atheism before posting.\n \n * if it's a special Facebook page, you can just mention its name and remind users to use the inner Facebook search engine\n\n * if it's a discussion, you can take a screenshot (and color out or blur names and faces) and upload it to some image file hosting website...  or you can copy/paste the text content\n\n * if it's a video, try looking for a copy of that video on some other website, like YouTube, it may already be posted.
