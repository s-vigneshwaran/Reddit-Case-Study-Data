  "text": "TIFU reading a manuscript my ex gf wrote\nA few days ago I (28m) got an email from my ex gf (25) with the subject line: \"I did it thanks to you!\". The email had an attachment. The attachment was a manuscript. The manuscript was an autobiography written by my ex gf. The title of the autobiography instantly took me back to the time when my ex gf and I were still dating. \n\nI was sexually inexperienced back in those days whereas my ex gf had more than enough sexual experience. We enjoyed talking about past relationships and what the sex was like. It was never \"a thing\" in our relationship. Just casual conversation. My ex gf had more stories to tell and all of them were entertaining. I remember joking about how she should someday write a book. We laughed, made love, and a few months later, our relationship came to an end. It was sad, but alas, life continued. \n\nWe're now back in the present. I finished reading the manuscript an hour ago. There were 72 chapters. Each chapter was about an individual person my ex gf had known sexually. No real names were mentioned. Only character labels. Like The Surfer, The Biker, The Jock, The Older Man, etc. Some of the stories and \"characters\" I actually remembered based on the details my ex gf shared with me during our relationship. Others were totally new. But new or not, it was fun to read. Until I made it to Chapter 39. My chapter. \"The Turtle\". \n\nKeep in mind, all the sexual partners my ex gf mentioned in her manuscript had something specific about them that made the sex memorable for her. For example, The Surfer always smelled like the ocean, which never failed to turn her on. The Biker had gang tattoos from the neck down, but the one tattoo that always made her rip his clothes off was his pet hamster tattoo. Then there was me. A guy who couldn't swim, let alone surf, no tattoos, and with practically zero sexual experience at the time. What was so memorable about me? \n\nWell, according to my chapter, the answer was my \"adorably small penis\". My ex gf described how she had almost forgotten what it felt like NOT to choke during oral, before she met me. She compared my penis to the head of a baby turtle, thus my chapter and character name. Based on what I was reading, not only did I have the smallest penis compared to all the other people she's dated, but I also had the only penis that somehow managed to look \"too innocent\" for sex. \n\nIt didn't come across as if my ex gf was purposefully trying to insult me, but come on, I think most people can understand what a sensitive topic penis size can be to any guy who's not hung like a horse. I still need to contact my ex gf and provide my feedback, but I'm gonna need some time to process what I read. It's not every day someone writes a book about your small dick. Welcome back, insecurities I didn't think I would have at this age. \n\nTL:DR Jokingly encouraged my ex gf to write a book about her adventurous sex life when we were still together. She wrote a manuscript years later and recently sent it to me. To my surprise (and horror), I was in said manuscript, and so was my \"adorably small penis\".",

Yes, condoms by design (fluted top, smaller base) are elastic. The base also has more material to help it fit snugly to prevent slipping or leakage. The nature of elastic items is that while they can be stretched, they will shrink to the smallest size closest to the original size. This is what makes elastic items useful. You can stretch a condom with water, but the entire time it is producing force back on the water. That's fine for water, because water doesn't have nerve endings. When you're trying to shove a penis into the reinforced end of a condom that's too small, it is not pleasant. Furthermore, if it's too small throughout its length, it creates unpleasant pressure across the penis. Condoms that are too small also have decreased effectiveness for preventing pregnancy and STIs.",

Is the reason you are walking on eggshells because you are approaching the conversation in the exact same way as everyone else before you - and people are just bored of hearing about it? \n\nWhat are you *adding* to the conversation?",

Or the one we're currently having on Reddit?\n\nAll I'm saying is when you throw around mentions of 'historical 'benefits' for men, keep in mind there are thirty-sum year old men who have gone their entire adult lives in the days where we don't have that kind of benefits. So that point does **not** resonate with us. That history didn't mostly end last year, it mostly ended over a decade ago. It stopped being ok for men to act like assholes. We've had to walk on eggshells our entire adult lives.\n\nIt's kinda like talking about how good rich white people had it 'back in the day' to an audience of poor whites and expecting them to be ok with continuing to be poor because you want to course correct.\n\nSo maybe just leave your point about 'historical benefits' in the past where it belongs",

So more power to the OP for his self-confidence.\n\nBut that confidence is probably what made his ex-gf misread the situation.  I dunno, I can just imagine her thinking *\"well, he's so confident he probably knows this about himself and is at peace with it.\"*  \n\nI'm not trying to defend the ex-gf because, yeah, that's super shitty even if it was an innocent mistake on her part.  Just saying that she might not have been purposefully trying to wreck the guy.",

I read an autobiographical story once, believe it was called \"Mob Girl\"..or something to that effect. It was only appealing as a peek into the world, and lives of the men it detailed, and was very shallow, and unappealing. Just basically a dead woman, who slept with important men. In the end, this guy probably shines through as the only real relatable, and rootable character mentioned. I think most women would talk about how shallow she is, and speculate that she maybe missed the more important things. Which, from her behavior in sending it directly to him, and crediting him, she seems more aware of that than she lets on. She's negging him, and she wrote a whole damn book to do it. It's screams desperate.\n\nHe should just say he hasn't finished it, if she asks, and that he can't really even get through the first chapter. Then suggest a rewrite, with a more interesting protagonist, and more depth.",

Really all the sensitive spots for woman are about 1 inch in and on the outside. It's all about foreplay, communication and how you feel about each other, to me there is no one sexier in the world and I have never had better sex then I have with him. I am convinced that because sex for woman is much more a mental thing, a part of the reason that some are more turned on by big sizes, is because we are in a culture that puts out the image that this is more desirable.",

Her friends asking to help their friend/sister/cousin etc out of a bad situation (drunk and with a couple other girls and one dude) but the moment the dude leaves and you tell them to pack up, they do the same to you.

Maybe there is someone else she bedded that is smaller and less experienced than you.  If in fact you are that particular chapter, I\u2019d make sure you are not identifiable in any way first.  Lastly, I\u2019m not you and don\u2019t know her.  Would she be receptive to discussing your displeasure of being in the book?

If you were to measure this, you would probably do so using the width of the introitus, the opening to the vagina, as this is where the penis enters, and where you would feel the \"tightness\" of the vagina.\n\nThe data you have linked shows a range of about 19mm, so about 0.7 inches of difference between different women and their introitus.

According to studies done of women of varying ages and sizes, the difference in range is about 0.5 inches. Are you telling me you can tell the difference of half an inch?

I\u2019d be willing to bet for most that it\u2019s just a generic factory model they pass off as theirs- they get a vulva mold not a vagina mold because I can\u2019t think of a way you would even do that??

Not super excessive but if she was like 35 that would reduce it to 3.8 per year which doesn't seem overboard at all for someone that doesn't end up in a long-term relationship.",

I'm pretty sure in 2019 maybe 70% of fics there were M/M. Fighting probably falls in line with a lot of other fandoms too, from my understanding it happens a lot in other Anime, Supernatural, or Harry Potter fics. \n\n>was never sure if it was good enough for AO3 or would be a good fit for it\n\nBelieve me, everything is a good fit for AO3. And genuinely, don't let things like \"it might not be good enough\" stop you from doing things, especially if it's posting on a fanfiction site. I've been browsing it for near a decade now, and there is a whole range of quality out there. You wouldn't be out of place no matter what you're writing. \n\nOf course, don't ever feel like you *have* to do anything like post there if you're not ready yet or don't ever want to. But don't feel like you can't either!! I promise it's actually a very welcoming community, and niches do very well there. \n\nHeck, I would write weird reader insert fanfictions for obscure fandoms when I was 13 there, and I still get comments telling me that they enjoyed reading them to this day! People are very kind and mostly just happy to see others being interested in similar stuff. \n\nSo, if you haven't before, have a browse around tags and ships you like writing about, see what's up. And, *if you want to*, always feel free to post there, I promise your work is more than good enough :)",

When talking about women's bodies we all expect that the women are cool with it as long as we're in the territory of \"brutally honest\", and the fact that some women aren't is constantly made fun of (memes, popculture, day to day life, you chose).\n\n\nWhen a guy gets a very positive feedback about his dick and sexual performance, BUT it mentions that his penis does not have one of the arbitrary criteria said to make a penis \"good\", he starts melting down over it. Like, yes, people have insecurities, we all do. But people are fully behind his overreaction and saying the woman is malicious and mean spirited (lol and arrogant for writing the \"biography\" that he jokingly suggested), and they're not treating this as a triggered insecurity but like an actual and intentional insult. \n\n\nSo MAYBE we should think about if that a) makes sense and b) is fair.

If someone had chosen to live in 72 countries before we met, I wouldn't expect them to want to stay in one country with me for decades. It's contrary to the past behaviour that I can see",

I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of her relationships have ended because she met a new guy, 72 relationships in 108 months doesn't leave much room to be single in between.",

As you\u2019re probably well aware, society awards the highest honors for young men who overachieve as sexual \u201cconquerors\u201d of women, they are praised for the same patterns that a woman might be shamed for.\n\nI\u2019ll hazard a guess that your friend is in his 20s or 30s. That reward system is less favorable for men in their 40s+ (still worse for women), and that\u2019s when I would expect to see whether his satisfaction with this lifestyle is genuinely about those emotionless physical relationships, or if it was related to that dopamine reward for his perceived manly achievements.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m only one person, some people might be wired that way. But I\u2019m almost certain that *most* people are not. Sadly, consensual sex does not imply that feelings will not be hurt in the aftermath, and running through a bunch of partners makes it likely that some of them will not be entirely unscathed by the encounter.",

The initial comment that sparked this sub-thread establishes sex positivity, and I think we all agree that sex is a very natural and good thing when people are mindful to take care of themselves psychologically and physically.\n\nIf this person and all of her sex partners all felt that they were sincerely respected on the emotional and psychological levels, not just the consensual physical intercourse, then that is great and I wish more power to them! In my experience, that\u2019s not how humans work - feelings are probably getting hurt here, and OP\u2019s story seems to suggest she\u2019s not too worried about how her partners are left feeling from her actions.",

But now as a young adult, if I could snap my fingers and get a bigger dick, I would decline. I used to think women wanted stretched and pounded from porn -- turns out that while some women do want that, the majority of women [I've been with] DON'T want that. Slow, steady, and deep usually does the trick instead. \n\nI also realize now that most women (but not all) get off more by what you DO during sex than by the size of your penis. I would estimate I have penetrative sex only 50% of the time I engage in sex these days, because other stuff is usually more fun. So penis size doesn't really factor into things. \n\nYou also can't do anal with a huge dick, at least not for the vast majority of women. \n\nI should mention I'm about average (around 6 inches in both length and circumference) when fully erect. Definitely a grower too! But I usually can't bottom out most women, they just aren't deep enough, so if I was smaller it would make little difference to me. \n\nAnywho, for any insecure guy with a tiny pecker who is reading this... The only thing your tiny pecker is affecting is your state of mind. Yeah, maybe some girls want a huge dick. But some girls also want to get tied up, slapped around, and humiliated. Some girls want to peg you. Some girls don't even like dick at all. What I'm saying is... Your penis is fine. Finding a sexually compatible partner is what matters. Having insecurity about something so silly as penis size is the real issue, and it will ruin your sex life if you let it.",

As long as he/she is not purposefully leading the other party on, there's aboslutely NO problem with having sex.\n\nEdit: also, what's an acceptable amount of partners a year according to you? 3? 6? What if it's 6 and they had 5 partners, are you gonna judge them harshly if they have sex with a 6th person, but think they're judt fine if they stay at 5? Like should they refuse any more potential partner because they reached a completely arbitrary threshold?\n\nThis doesn't have any logical ground to stand on, honestly.",

She could've just called it \"an adorable penis\" - which would still probably not be ideal because of how men typically struggle with being called cute and such, but then I'd be willing to believe that it might've been written in good faith. But believe me, you need pretty much zero social understanding to know that men don't really appreciate having their dick called small, undern any circumstance. I'm sorry but I don't think there's any way she wrote this in good faith, whatever her actual reasons to do so might have been.\n\nETA: the *only* circumstances in which I'd give her the benefit of the doubt would be if she had spent the rest of the chapter raving about how much better she likes smaller penises and why. Then it could've been taken as an intended compliment, in the face of the bad rep small penises tend to unfairly get. Doesn't really sound like this was the case though.",

Not the jokes you guys might have had during sex, or the opportunity to explore sex with someone less experienced, or the fact that you gave her the idea for the book. She focused on your dick size and given the context of the other chapters, that was the intent.\n\n\nThat might be hard to accept but as a woman, I can speak to the fact that every goddamn woman is fully aware of how sensitive men are about their dick sizes since we as women have that sensitivity about fucking everything about ourselves (boobs, face, butt, vag, etc. Comes with the territory of being seen as sex objects in society)\n\n\nThis was a low blow move.",

That's not common. \n\nI've known a handful of people of all genders who substitute their sexual experiences for a personality, and quite a few more artists, filmmakers, and writers who see the world around them as \"fair game\" to repurpose as a product to make them money and gain notoriety. \n\nThere's actually an old Paul Rudd movie about it: https://youtu.be/qaJnlCrx8GI\n\nAnd yeah ignoring the male ego side of things, it's really unethical of someone to catalog and share sexual experiences for profit without consent, even if it's technically legal. She should and would have been aware of what she wrote, and that it wasn't flattering, and not even if she didn't think it was a problem she should have cleared it with every party.",

There are videos all over the internet saying \u201cdon\u2019t let anyone else tell you differently, size DOES matter\u201d.  There are jokes and videos about girls laughing at micropenises.\n\nWhen this ultimately impacts a man\u2019s belief that they\u2019re unable to satisfy their partner and that it makes them ultimately less attractive to the opposite sex, of course it will lead to insecurity.  They develop anxiety, become less confident, and develop insecurities.\n\nThese insecurities are *so* difficult to fight, when basically everything around you is telling you that size does matter.\n\nFor you to go one step further and make fun of those same people for being insecure is deplorable.  Would you do the same for someone - regardless of gender - who\u2019s insecure about their looks? About their weight?  About being cheated on?",

I would be surprised if this came up as an insult if we were talking about a guy.\n\nYes, I see that the book is about her sex life and that there have been a number of encounters.

She's a crappy person for the whole manuscript and the logic behind the insult co. pliments, yes. But why the need to know something real about them, about all of them? People expect women to be nurses, mothers, psychologists of random strangers. She may nit have wanted to know all of them deeply, and that's fine. The book is like a collage of her thoughts, not a paper. And yes, she's objectifying them if she only talks about their looks. But 72 partners and not knowing them, is fine too.",

I\u2019d rather have a lackluster sex life with a faithful, good, loving partner that is my best friend than an incredible sex life with some dbag that has been the town bike and could give less of a shit about my feelings - and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not an uncommon sentiment lol. There are too many jerks out there.\n\nWith that being said, I\u2019d rather deal with too big than too small and have a lot of girlfriends who would say the same, if sexual prowess is still the same. A lot of guys are good at oral/other means without trying to compensate for size.\n\n9\u201d over 3\u201d really is a no brainer.\n\nIt\u2019s a personal preference kind of thing, everyone is different. Like chocolate vs vanilla - it\u2019s probably a 50/50 split, and then you\u2019ve got the many variations and varieties that we all love that contribute.",

I mean, I'm sure some people like the growing aspect, but it is still embarrassing during casual nudity or medical nudity because..  you can't just get yourself hard to prove you're bigger. You also know your size so people will say, why feel bad, why want to prove it? That'd be logical if it was a normal person's flaccid size, but again, it's micropenis level when soft a lot of the time. Then grows to the size stated before.\n\nSo yeah, it's a struggle. Luckily in non-medical situations, I am not showing my dick to anyone who I am not intimately close to, so it works out nowadays. Skinny dipping years ago as teenagers always was anxiety-ridden though lol everyone ended up hard anyway, so it wasn't so bad, just awkward. But boy, taking clothes off in the wind all shriveled up... damned if you do, damned if you don't.\n\nI wrote a much bigger reply about feelings of inferiority and how I grew out of it (no pun intended) and many other things, but realized that'd be silly/annoying for this post. But yeah, it can be embarrassing. Like the smaller dude who is very powerful and people make jokes about, but obviously he doesn't just want to grab the heaviest thing and flip it over, or fight some big guy to prove it. They know they're strong, but it's still embarrassing how people view it. It's the 2 inch flaccid dick situation lol \n\nYou learn to not care so much, because tbh it should only matter to you and anyone you are intimate with. But all of us have our pride/ego, so it can't be truly extinguished I guess.",

They wanted to get off their shift and not have some dude embarrassed about his raisin.\n\nNah, it's real, the struggle is real. May the force be with your grower-not-a-shower-pp, fellow raisin.\n\nedit: Just being serious, medical professionals really usually do not care, it is our mental blocks that are usually the problem. I also had an exam done by an (attractive) woman doctor, and got hard as a rock. I apologized profusely, and when she realized ehat I meant, she was like \"oh, I didn't even notice. You're fine, it's normal.\"\n\nSo, it goes both ways, I suppose. Nurses clean shit on the daily, they also see shriveled and hard dicks on the daily.

But you should really reconsider the source you've provided is not of equivalent quality. 1,300 women who self-selected their participation for a place called Bad Girls Bible, and then self-reported their answers means there's a lot of bias inherent in that.\n\nTime and time again, when we look at objective data, we see what I said earlier - men are more focused overall with size, women less so, but that size queens do in fact exist at a rate of ~1 in 20.",

It didn't matter that I was good to him, treated him with respect, never judged him for struggling to find work, and we had tonnes of fun playing Pokemon and Yugioh TCG I just wasn't \"sexy\"\n\nI did get the satisfaction of receiving a Skype message from him weeks later telling me how he misses me, how his new gf treats him like shit and verbally abused him, and how he actually wanted me back. Well, I may have been bigger back then but I was not desperate! I basically told him to kick rocks and never speak to me again \n\nAll in all, I've learned that when things like this happen, it's actually not about me. They're either working through something themselves or are the kind of person who doesn't want to compromise on physical attraction which I find fair. There are many people who place sexual compatibility as being extremely important and so long as they're kind and nonjudgmental about it, I think it's fine. I know not everyone will find me attractive, fat or thin, and for me it helps me weed out the people I do want to try and connect with\n\nI hope you have or will find someone who will love you for you and all the bits and bobs that come with you \u263a\ufe0f You're worthy of love and affection!",

I don't have a fetish for insecurity, nothing about what I like about small dicks have to do with how the guy feels about his dick\n\nIt's a fetish, so it's inherently a selfish act. It's about ME, not them. I enjoy them, I prefer them, and if I ever ended up spending my life with a man I'd HOPE his dick is no bigger than 4-5inches \n\nIt's also more than a fetish, it's what I'm comfortable with and it also happens to turns me on\n\nI always want my partners to feel comfortable. I do not treat sex lightly in the first place. I don't have random sex, I don't do one night stands, and I don't even want to have sex with someone unless I'm emotionally attached to them and that can take months/years. For the most part I consider myself demisexual\n\nBut again, I'd really like to reiterate that the point of my bringing it up at all is to say there are women/people like me in the world who enjoy that and it's possible to find someone to date/marry/etc who will genuinely love you and your body\n\nIt just also happens, as I said, to be a huge turn on/fetish for me, personally",

It depends on the execution.\n\nbut really, based on the examples presented, it hardly looks like a tacky over-simplification. Other than the small penis thing; the other two examples refer to the odor of a man that reminisced of his connection to the sea and how a seemingly tough man was perceived as attractive on how he didn\u2019t shy away of his sweeter side (through a tattoo of his pet hamster).\n\nI am not saying this is good.

Much more variables (for instance we know this person has had serious partners which probably means not seeking for other sex partners for a while) and this is incredibly reductive; but just to prove the point.\nFor a margin of error out of variables let\u2019s reduce it to 100. \n\nOut of 100  yearly potential encounters you engage with 9. That means you actually engage successfully 9% of the times you could technically have met a sexual partner.\n\nIt is indeed feasible.\n\nSurely with your 35 sexual partners you realize this number (which is probably high for a lot of people) is the result (probably) of just putting yourself out there, being open to meeting people in that fashion, and being a normal human being with your upsides and downsides, who happen to stumble upon other human beings who appreciate your upsides and are also down for business.",

If maybe this is something she can learn from.  It's like if you wrote something about how you enjoy her belly and how it was \"nice she didn't have flat stomach so you could enjoy the sex more cause it was soft and not bony\" would she see it as a \"compliment\" not matter what your intent was? I doubt it.  \n\nJust tell her that you're glad she didn't show this to you when you were younger because it would have wrecked your self-confidence. But fortunately you're in a better place. I'm not sure what's going on with her head, but at least you'll get to say your piece instead of just telling random internet strangers.",

I don\u2019t think it merits her getting back to this topic months after a break up where people have moved on in life - and that too by sending a 70 chapter manuscript written with the intention of specifically and seemingly innocently insulting an ex. Months have passed, at the very least - but maybe even more time than that has passed? To me, it\u2019s hard to believe that the intention of sending this manuscript is anything other than making the ex feel somewhat bad. I\u2019m not saying that was the intention behind writing the manuscript in the first place. But sending it? It\u2019s also somewhat unlikely that someone dates a bunch of seemingly cool people with big penises and then there\u2019s this one person with a small dick and that\u2019s what their chapter is about. Even if that\u2019s true, it\u2019s just weird and creepy.\n\nFor me, it was easy to see this when I reversed genders and put myself in the position of the ex girlfriend. Would I send a 70 chapter manuscript to my ex from several months back where every other girl is mentioned as some cool hottie, and then I point out how this particular ex had something not-that-great about her but that was adorable. Take your pick: boobs were too small, flat ass, thick ankles or worse... \u201cBut it was oh so adorable!\u201d It would be creepy of me to do that.

I heard a quote on one podcast they were talking about this and I think she said something along the lines of \"women only want to be equal to men in the things that give them benefits, but revert to old times when it takes away from them. Like those girls that demand equality but then say your the man you should be throwing money at me while I'm sitting at home not working type of thing.\" I just think it's an interesting conversation.",

A vaginas entrance varies around 0.7 inches in width, (based on the study you linked) between women.\n2. Penis length varies anywhere between 2-10 inches (based on your numbers) \n3. A range of 0.7 is less than a range of 8 inches.\n4. This means that vaginas do not vary as much as penises do *in regards to what people are referring to when they are discussing the size of their genitals* (vaginas can vary greatly in canal length and other areas, but this is not what we are talking about when a vagina is called \u201cloose\u201d because the vaginal canal length has no effect on tightness, the width of the entrance does.)\n5. If you believe that a difference of 0.7 inches is enough to make a woman feel a great deal looser during penetration than another, I would think you are probably projecting insecurities.",

There most definitely are studies on the range of penis lengths, and It would be helpful to this discussion.\n\nHaving just looked up some data on penis girth, I have found that the variation is around 2 inches. Seeing as 0.7 is smaller than 2 inches, can you see how it is more to do with the size of the penis than the width of the vagina that determines what feels tight?",

You can play with these numbers all day but as long as you are comparing apples to apples similar patterns continue to occur in various dimensions both unaroused and aroused.\n\nYou may be confusing girth with width (same idea but numerically different).  Girth is measured by circumference.  Try converting penis girth (circumference) to penis width (the equivalent) then compare that to vagina width to get more comparable numerical figures.  Like like comparing miles to kilometers needs conversion from one to the other for accurate numerical comparisons.",

She also knows that you\u2019re not all that experienced and reading her smut rag will do nothing to help your confidence.\n\nIf she wanted to be some dollar store Ana\u00efs Nin and write some creative non-fiction about her sexual experiences then fine.

Women can have their breast enlarged or reduced depending on their size. They can even have surgery to repair or tighten their vagina if need be. They can have implants if they have a flat ass. Even liposuction to sculpt their bodies. They can change absolutely everything physical on their body. \n\nOur penis is our penis. If we have E.D. There\u2019s fuel for embarrassment. If we can\u2019t reach the spots they like, fuel for embarrassment. If we\u2019re too skinny, fuel for embarrassment. Not enough sperm to give them a child, fuel for embarrassment.

And tbh why wouldn't she? I'm sure it's a perfectly fine genital and when someone loves you, stupid things like penis size doesn't matter to them. \nI don't think you should be insecure about it. Sure it's a bit of a punch in the gut, reading that about yourself, but she talks about your shared sexual experience with love, isn't she? And if I'm not mistaken, you said she even mentiones she LOVED that thing about you. So why wouldn't other women like it?\nDon't be sad about this!",

I promise you, no matter who your partner is, they will have huge insecurities too. You don't need to address the content of the book, tell her overall what you think of it.

And how now that she was free of the chore of sucking her exes dick (that being me) she just loved picking up guys off of Craigslist and feeling them spurt into her mouth. I broke up with her again after that and told her to enjoy sucking strangers dicks.

It's messed up.\n\nSays a lot that this is seen as normal or even hot when it happens to a woman. It's crazy that we've been conditioned to think the bigger the better when it comes to dicks, regardless of the comfort or pleasure of the actual woman involved. Sorry for the rant but that stuck out to me. \n\nI can definitely see why everything else she said would be such a bummer to read though, so your reaction is understandable.",

Different strokes for different folk (pun intended).

What good does openly judging other people do really?

Men get to screw how ever many people they want and the more people they bang and abandon, the more highly regarded they are. A woman sleeps with more than one man and she\u2019s disgusting, unclean, ruined, a whore, immoral. Why should we have to just shut up and accept this? Why *shouldn\u2019t* we point out that it\u2019s a ridiculous double standard? Why should we have to put up with often times downright nasty words from judgemental people? And why is it anyones concern what anyone is doing in the bedroom with other consenting adults? Are we truly that sad as a society that we judge people based on how many people they choose to sleep with instead of who they are as a person. We\u2019re a smart enough species to look past our biases.\n\nAnd plenty of pornstars and other sex workers married and even have families. While I wouldn\u2019t personally marry one, that doesn\u2019t mean I have a right to shame people who would. It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business but their own.\n\nTo be clear, I also dislike the fact that men are seen as lesser if they haven\u2019t slept with lots of women. I think both standards are sad extremes that need to be abandoned, though I know that\u2019s not likely to happen.",

I get that men think having a big dick means that you win the lottery, but honestly I could make a list of all the reasons i don't like big dicks. in fact here it is:\n\n1. as your ex said, giving oral sucks sometimes. it's harder to please them and you choke. not fun. small dicks are easier to get good suction on and you can go for longer\n2. most men don't really wait until I'm wet enough to penetrate, so big dicks hit my cervix pretty hard and I just can't fucking stand it. this usually causes me to stop things very prematurely.\n3. people with big dicks never learn how to properly fuck. they just think because their dick is big that's all they need. but personally I barely feel penetration. the excitement in it comes from my partners enjoyment and that's pretty much it. those with below average dicks however usually know more than just pumping their hips.\n\nI think if I were to ever settle down for a man I'd pick someone with a below average dick tbh.",

Then she goes and fucking sends it to you knowing that you\u2019re the turtle and you probably aren\u2019t going to like what you read? Idk seems like a massive jab to me. I\u2019d genuinely ask her why she sent it to you if she\u2019s going to do nothing but insult you the entire time in your chapter. Also, that many sexual partners at her age does not give her much room to talk about anything. I think that\u2019s pretty fucked up honestly",

If someone has a loose vagina then saying as much isn't shaming, it's stating a fact. That being said, there is no such thing as a \"loose\" vagina. I've been with over 100 woman. There was one who both I, who have a small penis, and a well endowed friend, found to be loose. We didn't shame her for it when we discussed it. It was a matter of fact. The thing about vaginas though is, they can be trained to be tighter. Men can't make there penis grow. I think of a loose vagina like an overweight person. Stating as such isn't shaming if it's a fact. Not sure why it has to be, \"if the roles were reversed, this wouldn't be okay.\" Personally, I like loose vaginas. I usually lasted longer. Loose, tight, big, small. People have preferences. No shame in pointing out when there isn't a good fit. This person that the OP is talking about was merely stating what she sees as factual based on her data. She didn't say it was bad. She didn't say the sex wasn't good. Men get so insecure about there endowment because they think P in V is all there is. Look at the statistics, straight men aren't very good at sex anyways. And just b many think it's about size and not skill. This is one of those things where suddenly bro code kicks in and men feel the need to stick up for those other not well endowed men, like they need defending. There's nothing to defend here other than how OP feels about this. Which isn't an issue to begin with. I'm sure he'll find someone that enjoys what someone describes as small, because it's about preference, not shame.",

I've been with over 100 woman. There was one who both I, who have a small penis, and a well endowed friend, found to be loose. We didn't shame her for it when we discussed it. It was a matter of fact. The thing about vaginas though is, they can be trained to be tighter. Men can't make there penis grow. I think of a loose vagina like an overweight person. Stating as such isn't shaming if it's a fact. Not sure why it has to be, \"if the roles were reversed, this wouldn't be okay.\" Personally, I like loose vaginas. I usually lasted longer. Loose, tight, big, small. People have preferences. No shame in pointing out when there isn't a good fit. This person that the OP is talking about was merely stating what she sees as factual based on her data. She didn't say it was bad. She didn't say the sex wasn't good.

If anything, it is a defense that having a small penis is not the end of the world, as the ex seems to portray it as something she liked. \nI don\u2019t deny the obvious, which is given our societal views, it is 100% normal for OP to feel hurt in seeing himself presented with his small penis being his most adorable sexual trait. \nBut I didn\u2019t read it as body shaming him for his small penis. If anything, it reads like \u201cyeah, it was a small penis, and I sorta liked it in its own way\u201d.\n\nI do agree the low blow was to send the manuscript without a proper preparation of what was to come. But maybe she was unsure how to approach it and just sent him the manuscript for him to check and for them to discuss it? Dunno, I acknowledge we know nothing of this person. Jerk move or a step into discussing how he felt about it? Would love to see an EDIT by OP telling us more if he gets to talk to the ex about his thoughts.\n\nAny sort of body shaming is not OK.

Where is the article arguing \"there are no small penises\" at?  The same logic could be equally applied to penises.  But it usually is not because of sexist hypocrisy.\n\nIt is very clear that someone applying the word \"loose\" to a vagina means they think it is larger and less tight by comparison with other vaginas.  The same exact way the word \"small\" is often applied to penises.  Drawing some kind of distinction between the two does not make any sense except in the context of hypocrisy.",

Are you sure you don't still have even the slightest amount of feelings for her? Because you are really talking her up like she wrote that chapter out of sincerity for her passion of small penises. I'm going to go ahead and take a wild guess that she didn't primarily seek out smaller packages after your encounter with her. Honestly, this entire \"creative writing\" exercise sounds like a really sad attempt at making herself seem exciting, experienced and unique... when in all reality, writing a book about every single sexual experience you have ever had is self indulgent and uninventive.",

She's grateful, steps in and I go back to my phone to send a text. I'm leaning against the wall of the elevator as it nears our floor and as the doors open I look up to see a huge grin plastered on this lovely young woman's face. A knowing, sly and playful grin, so I assumed. Maybe she just thinks I'm cute \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I smile back and walk to the break room to clock in, go to re-tuck my shirt and find that my fly is down. I had readjusted the boys during lunch and failed to zip back up. Now I hear giggles whenever I leave a room with two women and have been getting some really odd looks. I'm happily married for over a decade now, totally average penis if you can take my word for it. The way I figure, they're more than welcome to think about my unit as much as they like.",

For many reasons,a few of them being:\n\n1. Men with with less inches typically spend more time on foreplay and other more desirable aspects of sex - they recognize sex isn't all about penetration! A HUGE turn on for many women. \n\n2. They're typically more humble in nature - another major turn on, \n\nAnd,\n3. For women like me with a sensitive vagina that cannot handle a larger penis (I have a lot pain from guys who think going deep is going to get my G Spot) a smaller penis makes me cum over and over again.\n\nIn summary: don't let society or your ex dictate the true value your beautiful dick can have. There are many people out there who will celebrate it!",

And although so many of us have instant answers regarding a relationship none of us know anything about...it falls on you to use your best judgement.  \n\nIf you have been friends since you broke up (it can happen) then perhaps it isn't meant so much as a slam but as \"Hey, I did that thing\" or \"I trust your opinion.\"  Then hey, if you want to, give it an honest eval based on her writing style, etc...not necessarily the subject matter itself.\n\nBut if like most exes, you haven't even spoken since...then wtf is this out-of-the-blue thing?  Like not even a \"Hey...do you remember when...well I actually did it.  Did you want to see?\"  I doubt it is a vindictive thing.  She'd have to be a pretty major sociopath to write an entire book hoping you'd read it all just to get the slam in.  Fuck, she could have just submitted some /r/OffMyChest about her ex, the turtle, and linked it to you, would have been a lot less involved.\n\nSo review it or don't, you are under no obligation.  And regarding your penile profile...hey, she had a good bit more experience before you...and with bigger dudes...and she still slept with you.  Obviously, it wasn't a dealbreaker.  And aside from extreme cases, it rarely is.  Bigger dudes fill out swimsuits, can look better naked, and brag.  But in the sack, it's about what you do, not so much what you have.  Besides...giving her Grade-A oral ...no girl gives a shit if your penis isn't a whopper.",

I mean, I wanted to write a letter to him to tell him what a pos he was when I was finished reading it. \n\nI guess I just felt bad for the girls that ended up being in the book and how they felt knowing what he thought about their encounter and put it down for everyone to read.

She's also an ex and sometimes exs are a bit vengeful for whatever reason. She might be trying to poke at you, but you don't have to identify with the vision of you she portrays. Be a sweet, caring, kind person and one day you'll have that reciprocated back to you. you are more than your genitals, don't make the mistake of thinking that a large penis makes anyone a good partner. Women put up with this image shite all the time, she might be trying to hit back in the same way she's been pummeled (image issues)....\n\nPs ; do not try and worm around and claim you are a different chapter as a lot suggest.

I can say I have met thousands of people from different cultures and nationalities and age groups, and not a single one of them thought about writing an autobiography at 25.\n\nLet me think with you about the book. A 72 chapters autobiography is mostly 200-300 page. Assuming she is a talented writer who had lots of practice, this is at least 5 months of work. We have two possibilities here, first, she did all of this to insult you. That is bat shot crazy, and I don't think a person who goes that extended length to hurt an ex is mentally stable, you should totally block her out of your life.\n\nThe second possibility is that she really think that her sex life is worth a 72 chapter book. I can't speak of all the readers around the world, but that is the least worthy thing to write about. Thus I think you again dodged a bullet, not as bad as the first possibility though.\n\nNow I can only advice you to ignore her knowing that you are living in her mind rent free. \n\nIf you can't do this, and think that you need to reply with a feedback I have an idea.  Using any online writing tool (e.g. prowritingaid.com) run a quick analysis of the book, print it out and using a red marker go through all the remarks and mark them out with a snarky comment here and there. At the last page of the book you can write a 3/10 total rating. Then send it to her address.",

The best among us try to overcome that inclination but it's there for everyone. She was just someone who indulged. If you want to read some actual literature instead of her crap, Dostoevsky will reassure you of this. There's a moment in The Idiot where one of the nicest characters in the whole book tells her brother that the girl he likes doesn't want him anymore.  It says:\n\n\"she, being human, could not resist the satisfaction of pouring even more poison into her brother\u2019s heart by exaggerating the calamity, even though she loved him sincerely and with compassion.\"\n\nThat's a fairly saintly girl towards her own brother. Type of girl to write a book like this doing something vindictive towards an ex? It's that or you have never noticed an extraordinary feature of something you look at several times a day. You're fine bro.",

Who the fuck writes down their exploits like this and then sends it to their ex???",

She\u2019s reducing the other \u201cbad boys\u201d to traits that are dehumanizing/archetypal in their own way. This was just the one she had for you. \n\nI would take it with a grain of salt. She\u2019s the author of a book, building her interest as the author. You obviously got a good dick, or she wouldn\u2019t have had a sexual relationship with you for months. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f she obviously just wants your reaction, which is why she sent it.

Was there no redeeming traits what so ever? Like okay smaller size then what I was used to but nice, guy, loved him etc? That just seems shallow on her part unless the book/story is only about hooking up. \n\nI've dated men and women and dick size or breast size or a great ass or whatever nice thing about the body isn't everything. Sure, it's nice but after like two weeks it's just normal so not a big problem or issue because the person is much more important. I like to have sex with people I genuinely like and love.\n\nI think, after reading all this, that even tough she wrote that about you in her book and you're not bad mouthing her, that she felt inspired by you and even send it to you.   \nI'm betting that even tough you're not the biggest in the sack, you are a genuine nice guy who doesn't need that to be a loved and liked you probably have a good heart and that's what the women you date like about you.

It's really not that important.\n\nSecondly, i went to uni with a guy we called big Dave. I thought this was due to his towering stature until a girl he tried to sleep with ran out of his room crying and saying 'get that thing away from me'. I then had a grown man crying about his lack of action due to what can only be described as a third leg.\n\nFinally, and i might be putting two and two together but............... If you're the type of person who's meeting enough people to have 72 sexual encounters in so few years, the people you're meeting up with are also generally like that. Men of more modest trouser blessings aren't generally the hit it and quit it type. I may be completely wrong here but my guess is that her reference set is probably not representative of the general population.\n\nI also wouldn't bother responding to her and if you do it would be to ask would she reciprocate by reviewing your comments about past girlfriends. No names will be divulged but her chapter should be 'Chapter 2 - syphilitic bucket clunge'",

I mean I'm sorry, but this just says enough about her.",

Its angle is 32 degrees. It's flaccid girth is 1 inch in diameter. His balls are 7 cm from the base. Randy notes that the drift of his penis is 4 cm to penis right and its dead weight is 4.5 Kg.

If she did solicit feedback, I still probably wouldn't send it. \n\n2. I think she likely assumes you wouldn't be as emotionally affected by it, because she isn't. She seems a bit self-absorbed, see also 25yr old memoir. Or she may think you're too stupid to know which one you are. Or she doesn't care.\n\n3. PLEASE trust me when I tell you, the magic is made when the tongue and fingers dance together. I've seen some great dicks, and not one of them could do what a trained tongue and fingers can.\n\n4. This girl is obviously not the one for you and probably not the one for anyone for a long time. Consider yourself lucky to have discarded her. \n\n5. You are worthy of love at any size. You are capable of giving pleasure at any size, and receiving it. You will meet someone who will show you this without saying a word. As with the rest of us, we never know when or where.

She dissed your sex life together, which, I'm sure, you did your utter best to make satisfactory.\n\nShe took that and kind of shat all over it. Being sex positive is alright. Fucking around and making fun of that one boyfriend who probably had the biggest feelings for you (my guess) is not alright.\n\nOf course I don't have the full picture, but from where I'm standing it looks like she's a bitch and you've been nothing but a good sport.
