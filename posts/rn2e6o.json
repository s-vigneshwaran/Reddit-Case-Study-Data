  "text": "TIFU by telling my bf he sounds like a minecraft villager\nStrap yourselves in everyone, I'm not quite sure what to do here. \n\nToday, my bf (m19) and I (f19) were sitting at the table having breakfast. During our conversation he brought up our escapades from last night. See, here's the issue reddit, my boyfriend is a great guy. Funny, smart, incredibly hot, but there's just one thing that is so hard for me to look past. Whenever we have sex, he makes these noises that sound exactly like a minecraft villager. Usually I can just ignore it, but last night Idk what happened but I just couldn't. \nAs he finished he made the loudest groan I've ever heard. This groan sounded like a bass boosted minecraft villager played at 100 volume through headphones. \n\nI lost it. \n\nI let out a little giggle and practically sprinted to the bathroom before I exploded with laughter. He heard and asked what was so funny, and I told him I just saw a funny post on my phone and that was that.\n\nWell that brings us to this morning. I was hoping he wouldn't say anything, but of course he had to ask what I saw that was so funny. At this point I figured I just had to tell him the truth.  So I said \"Babe, I'm really sorry, but last night you made a really funny sound and I couldn't stop.\" He's a good sport so he laughed, but then he asked me to describe it to him.  I told him that he makes villager noises whenever we had sex and he became very confused. So I pulled up a video on YouTube and it DID NOT sit well with him. He told me I was lying and there was no way. I told him that I wasn't lying and that really I'm used to it at this point, but then he accused me of trying to embarrass him and told me there was \"no way he could sound like that in bed\". I didn't step down, but I did tell him it was okay. He's pissed now though. He hasn't said a word to me since and we have to leave to go to see his family tomorrow for Christmas stuff.\n\nTl,dr: I told my boyfriend he sounds like a minecraft villager when we have sex and now he won't talk to me.",

Now I hide my face whenever sexy times happen and I can never relax enough to get anywhere during it. I hide behind my long hair or use pillows or cover my face with a blanket, or just turn my head away. It sucks but I can't get that image of him laughing his ass off at me and making fun of me afterwards for it out of my head.",

It's mostly passed but still happens from time to time. I don't care. \n\nWe've been together 13 years. I love our relationship because we just accept each other and all our little quirks. There's no need to feel self conscious around each other. \n\nI've also been through a lot this year, medically speaking. We've had some really deep conversations because of it. I've had 4 colorectal surgeries since May. For a while I had a blue tube hanging out my behind. Screams sexy, right? My partner made me feel so secure and confident. It didn't phase him. So it stopped phasing me. \n\nI feel really lucky to have found someone like him.",

An example would be your memory of how you heard about 9/11, what you were doing at the time, who you were with etc.\n\nAlso worth noting is that flashbulb memories actually don't have a lot of empirical support.

Is it only the subjective experience that matters, say for example that someone gives me a small compliment on my shoes that I carry with me for years while someone else might brush it off and forget it the next day - would that be a core memory for me?

So my takeaway from this post is- if someone has embarrassed and upset their significant other and you are going to ask advice, write it like they were going to read it, only that way would you be considering their feelings in full. I dunno.. just imagine reading this if you were the bf",

The drop chance for a saddle is pretty bad, especially without an enchantment, and if you don't know that you probably wouldn't fish enough to find out since food is easier to get by farming.\n\nTo actually use the fishing drops (Which are insane btw. You can fish enchanting books with mending, name tags and saddles which are all rather rare in the world) most people use auto fishing farms which are complex Redstone machines nowadays so nothing a person not playing with guides would probably manage to do.",

Then set up a raid farm (different ways to do this in bedrock and pc, easier in bedrock) and have a strong supply of emeralds and other fun stuff coming your way.  A sugarcane farm and a bunch of librarians can also get you loads of emeralds, even better if you zombify them all, cure them, and occasionally murder a bunch of marauders in front of them, so they think you are a hero.\n\nI think this is solid relationship advice for OP, she just needs to lock him up in a small room and threaten him with zombies bites, occasionally murdering people in front of him and he will love her again.",

At the time there were tons of different gods for different things, gods of wind, the harvest, even individual cities had their own gods. But the jewish people were able to get their god to effectively go viral, and each other major offshoot (prophet/book written) has been effectively fan fiction. The funny thing is when you look at actual biblical history there is so much that has gone awry because of how people decide one statement meant something else that most of what people spew at each other today has NOTHING to do with what the original book actually said. Even the original \"book\" is a collection of scrolls that contradict one another at various places.

Clearly your understanding of nervous laughter is something that you gained by watching T.V which is okay, as long as you don\u2019t pretend you know what you\u2019re talking about. Incongruous emotion isn\u2019t something that happens when you\u2019re trying to convince the person you\u2019re laughing at that what you\u2019re doing is okay. Especially when the person in question literally says they double down. I know I\u2019m arguing with literal teenagers and they don\u2019t have the best reading comprehension yet, but at least put the situation in context. Furthermore it\u2019s not like it matters because neither of us cares to confirm, but I have a degree in psychology and work in the field. I have at least some knowledge in the area.  \n\n\nThe last thing I want to say is, wow. Even if it\u2019s nervous laughter in the way that you interpret it. It\u2019s still not alright that they just once again, doubled down. As if telling someone that is upset that they\u2019re okay is helpful? If you want to advocate for people being assholes due to their mental state AKA nervous laughter, you still have to regard the person that was actually upset and has valid emotions.",

Before reacting to something, especially something very personal and intimate, do you think about how your reaction might be productive or not? If your partner tells you they love you, do you stop and have a good think about what the best answer is? Of course not. Reactions are subconscious and immediate. \n\nHe\u2019s a kid who was just told that a big (or at least seemingly big) part of having sex with him is hilarious. Of course he\u2019s going to feel horribly insecure and embarrassed about it",

But I also don't understand all the people that seem to think he's being too sensitive.

It made it more difficult to get them in the mood.  And easily ruined.  Ever went down on a woman who pushed you off because she was getting close to cumming and was trying not to because her ex-husband said her labia were too large and she made stupid noises when she came?  So the rest of the night instead of sex, you two just cuddle while you reassure her there is nothing wrong with her body,  or any noises made during sex, and try to deal with her insecurities and mild panic attack.  Because I have.  Slightly different scenarios and different women.  Its loads of fun.  I slept with a woman in her 40s who for decades would only have sex in the dark because of a comment her first boyfriend made about her breasts and having kids only made her insecurities worse.  Not a young, inexperienced niave kid anymore, but still had the complex she developed from his comments.\n\nThere is nothing wrong about having a fun time and some giggles/chuckles with sex.  You should be laughing _with_ your partner, but you should not be laughing _at_ your partner.  There are always natural things about our bodies, the way we talk or things we do that we are going to feel insecurities about.  Women wouldn't spend thousands of dollars on plastic surgery like breast augmentation or labiaplasty that can kill sensation.  There wouldn't be a market for face-lifts and fillers, nose jobs.  Rogaine wouldn't be a thing, penis enlargement scams would never be able to draw in any victims.\n\nHow did she handle it poorly?  The physically leaving was bad body language/communication.  It denotes abandonment and avoidance.  The white lies combined with coming clean represent a breakdown of trust. An example of better communication for something someone can't change would be, \"I love you, but I hate that tattoo.  Seriously who gets Jayden Smith's face on their thigh.  Sal isn't even the best Impractical Joker.\"  Playfully, still holding them to show with physical and verbal communication you care about them and accept them as they are.  If you are going to be playful, its good to throw on a little bit of spice too to demonstrate you still find them very desirable and so that they have nothing to feel insecure about because they are sexy and do 'it' for you.\n\nEroding trust and confidence in a relationship is far easier than building it back up again once its gone.\n\nMy $ 0.02 from experience.",

Later on in life maybe he learns to ignore and roll with this stuff but for now its gonna stay with him.\n One time when I was like 14 after an exam I went to play with my friends (and cellphones weren\u2019t a thing then) and I didn\u2019t inform my parents. So my father goes to my school to find out since I hadn\u2019t come home for a couple hours now. So he asks a teacher and she responds by saying oh that kid, the dark and fat kid that talks, and then I come home and boy were they mad, and I was sorry, it was completely my bad. But later on when I learned how the teacher identified me, ooof that hurt. See I had always been athletic, great hand eye coordination but was never like fit, like in a shredded way. I played multiple sports and was on school team as well. And I wasn\u2019t short either, but like above average height. So to be identified like a dark and fat kid was a shock to me. And its not like I discussed it with someone or was even mentioned again ever but this kind of thing stays with you, no matter how much you try to shake it",

Own it, move on from it, change it if he feels the need, but for God's sake this doesn't need to be a debilitating moment in his life or hers. \n\nThis sort of innocent thing getting blown out of proportion is absolutely mind boggling to me.\n\nThe guy denies it twice and accuses her of lying. He's in serious denial and for some reason doesn't want to come to terms that he makes weird noises. If anything, this is a personal problem with him being able to accept responsibility for his own weirdness and take ownership of something that he does that doesn't even bother his better half. \n\nThis thread is all just nuts.

I love that I can hear he is enjoying himself. I'd then tell him I find it super sexy when he's more guttural, or when he growls/anything that floats your boat. I'd use dirty talk when we are having sex to show him what sounds I do like. And I would definitely never mention that before he sounded like a minecraft villager. \n\nConfidence in the bedroom is hard to get back one you make some feel foolish, so it's best to avoid that regardless.",

You can\u2019t control what you are turned off by, and may not understand why you are turned off. She may even be mad at herself for being turned off but she cant control it. Its not always due to unreasonable expectations either- I fully understand and empathize with the fact that men feel pressure to not show emotion and its toxic as hell. You know what else is super toxic? Telling people what they can and cant find attractive.  Tdlr men can be as vulnerable and feminine as they want, women can be attracted or turned off by whatever",

OP tried to keep it a secret/hold it in, and it literally blew up when she couldn't hold back her laughter. Now bf is upset not just because he feels made fun of but because she let it get to the point where she literally had to run away.\n\nI don't see a problem with OP having a giggle during sex. Sex should be fun. Laughter and silliness can and should be part of that. So her bf makes a funny noise, who cares?",

I would break up with someone for weird sex noises too, only if they turned me off.\n\n When I was with my ex, we had this stupid joke we'd say in a Borat voice \"flop like a fish\", and sometimes during sex I would say it and literally flop like a fish.( He also did this to me) We laughed our asses off, and got back to it. We were naked and in love, so nothing short of a serious gross fart would have stopped us.\n\nSometimes when he would come he'd purposely make weird fucking noises. I thought it was hilarious. We're no longer together but I hold those memories dear to me. It all depends on how strong the relationship is. GF needs to analyze how willing she is to fuck a Minecraft character",

I kinda wanna start keeping track now just out of curiosity. Cause you're right, not everyone is posting in the same threads... but there IS a culture to each subreddit and most people in those subreddits have a similar mindset on things. Maybe not the new commenters but the majority of comments are made by veterans of the sub anyways...... I'm going down a rabbit hole here guys.... help",

There is a big difference between having a mutual giggle about some funny noise during sex and making fun of your partner in a one-sided way.",

We will all be fine.\n\nThat's the problem here though and why I do see it as a lack of maturity, nobody is saying you need to fix anything. It's not something to be fixed. The point is that we're all human, we all have differences, we'll do things that'll be silly to our SO because we're not the same people. I think a mature relationship should be able to handle this sort of stuff reasonably well. Internalizing it and ending a relationship over something as simple as saying \"you make a funny sound during sex\" is incredibly insecure and I can't imagine how a relationship like that functions because obviously that means you can't be open with each other. \n\nI always ask my SO for what they think and I stress to them to be brutally honest. Them not being forward with me doesn't mean they don't feel a certain way, so I much rather they be honest and upfront so we can talk about things or laugh them off together or compromise or whatever has to be done.",

He's feeling unattractive and vulnerable, so you gotta build him back up :)",

He\u2019s always gonna reflect on this moment and it\u2019ll permanently scar his sex life for years and years to come\u201d but I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case at all. I think most normal people would want to know that they\u2019re making weird sounds so that they can be mindful of it and correct it, if it really matters all that much to them. When I was younger and first starting to sexually experiment with a girl, she called me out on staring at her in a super intense way that \u201cmade her look like I was gonna murder her.\u201d At first I was embarrassed but I just made a mental note to not do that (I wasnt aware I was doing it in the first place lol) and from then on it was never a problem. Ultimately I was embarrassed for like five minutes but it spared me further embarrassment with future partners. I was glad she told me. People are also pointing out that there was another thread recently in r/askmen that was posted by a guy wondering if he should tell his girlfriend that she makes odd sounds while they have sex. All the comments are telling him no, that he shouldn\u2019t, and that it could ruin her sexual confidence and all that. I disagree with the double standard and he should tell her. Relationships are all about communication. If you can\u2019t tell your partner this kind of shit like OP in this post or the dude in that post then maybe your partner is extremely insecure",

Sometimes my boyfriend says I sound like his dog when I yawn and that doesn\u2019t offend me but if he said my moans during sex sounded doglike or something of that nature, I would feel a bit insulted. \n\nNobody wants to be compared to an unattractive or \u201cweird\u201d circumstance in the context of sex, unless it\u2019s a kink of theirs but in the case of your boyfriend, he got upset because he felt like you were making fun of something that is supposed to be hot, not funny. \n\nThere\u2019s not really much you can do to make him feel better other than apologize for offending him and say \u201cThis is what you get for dating a nerd.\u201d and leave it at that. He may find some light in the situation if you poke some fun at yourself in the meantime.",

I know it was tough not to laugh but man, I feel bad for your partner. He\u2019s understandably embarrassed and his trust in you may feel shaky now. You made fun of how he sounds when he\u2019s experiencing intense feels and that\u2019s tough to just handle, especially for men IMO. Because they already get told by society not to express emotions. \n\nNow you\u2019ve unintentionally told him that he should also be ashamed of expressing sensations and emotions when he\u2019s orgasming. I think your sex life and trust is gonna be greatly effected and it\u2019s gonna be hard to grow back from this. You\u2019ll have to work on trust first, and if/when you\u2019re having sex with him again you have to build up his confidence. \n\nI think in cases like this it\u2019s ok to lie, to save their feelings. If it\u2019s a small thing like a sound; not condoning cheating etc and not sharing it to \u201csave their feelings\u201d. But in this case of an embarrassing sexual sound, I think when he asked in the morning you should have again told him it\u2019s a funny thing on your phone, and then showed him something really funny. But by telling him the truth you reaffirmed the doubt he was already having in his head of, \u201cwhat if she was laughing at me?\u201d\n\nI hope you guys can recover from this, good luck!",

He starts thinking, and sees her running away to laugh. It's natural for him to wonder what she's laughing about, and also to wonder if he did anything wrong. \n\nSecond blunder was the initial lie. That makes him wonder, \"Well, why were you even thinking about that?\" Guys, generally, have little self-esteem as it is. That would have poked a huge hole in it.\n\nThe eventual honesty was nice, but poorly handled. It seems to me she was trying to prove her point instead of having a conversation. A snore isn't intimate. Bad odour isn't intimate. It doesn't require vulnerability. Sex does, especially since they're in a relationship. And if you hear from someone you trust that you sound like a cartoon character during sex, and that it's bad enough that she has to run away to another room to laugh about it? I'd say there are grounds for anger and resentment there.\n\nSure, being 19 is a big part of it. But what he faced wasn't criticism. She wasn't attempting to change a behaviour pattern. She was trying to justify her mismanagement of a situation she found hilarious.\n\nIt's going to leave a psychological mark for sure, especially because he's young. She needs to re-examine whether she wants to be right and justified, or have a relationship, because while both can be done, it requires finesse that comes with age. Diplomacy isn't really a concept for 19 year olds, sadly.\n\nEdit: spelling. Posting from phone, so formatting might be funky.",

There is no long-term relationship without not just putting up with your partners flaws, but then accepting and pretending they are not there.\"  \n\n\nThere's a great 5 min video of him discussing this and then some related concepts, here:  \n\n\n[https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/08/28/the-price-of-admission-dan-savage/](https://www.themarginalian.org/2014/08/28/the-price-of-admission-dan-savage/)  \n\n\nI don't know if this applies here to you, or not. I googled the minecraft villager sound. It's a weird sound, but I think that's because it's synthetic. Most people, free from anxiety and judgement, will make noises during sex, I believe. Maybe your boyfriend is making exceptionally weird noises, maybe you're just young and don't have many partners to compare him to. Men are incredibly sensitive about their sexual performances though, and your remark may have really cut him down more than you know. I know that wasn't your intent. But I felt it was worth taking this situation and trying to make it into a thoughtful moment of reflection or learning.   \n\n\nI hope you two find a healthy way to move past it. Life is messy and full of awkward moments. Good adults are the ones who work to move past that awkwardness.",

We try to bury feelings artificially and they only get stronger sometimes and resurface again. My luck it's been at the worst times.\n\nYour BF cares for you have an honest sit down with him and explain the situation. It's hard to be so open with people.

Just to run with it and pretend everything is ok.\n\nI have a plan. Firstly just try to let things settle for a while and not mention it. Hopefully he doesn't bring it up and eventually you're nearing the point where it's kind of forgotten about (it's not but we're pretending here, stick with me). Don't worry that he might still be mad, if he doesn't bring it up everything is going to plan.  We want to catch him off guard, it's for the best.\n\nSo now we're ready for the reveal. So you tell him you're thinking of spicing things up in the bedroom. A bit of role play, it could be fun (you need to sell it here, do your thing, I don't need to tell you how to suck an egg, do your thing). Then one he agrees (of course he agrees because who wouldn't) , you produce [this](https://www.etsy.com/uk/listing/848722272/minecraft-villager-head-mask-made-to). Now I know it isn't exactly cheap (no affiliation btw) but this is your relationship we're talking about, it's worth it. He has to wear it during sexy time from now on. Problem solved.\n\n\n\nI'm so sorry.",

People make stupid faces and noises and there\u2019s nothing wrong with cracking up over it, just means that you\u2019re comfortable around them :)",

He\u2019s either gonna be okay with it and accept it\u2019s in his animalistic nature to sound like the village folk, or he will become a mute during sex. So you either don\u2019t have to ignore it anymore, or he becomes aware and fine w it. Personally\u2026I\u2019m dying laughing at the story due to somewhat understanding his feelings. He will be okay. BUT DONT TELL HIS FRIENDS OR ANYONE ABOUT IT. The amount of shit he will catch lol so plz don\u2019t tell people you both know IRL.",
