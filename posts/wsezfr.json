  "text": "TIFU by accidentally searching Riley Reid on my wife's phone\n \n\nMy wife broke her phone over the weekend, so we got her a new one. After it came in yesterday, she used my phone to log onto her Google account to so something, sets her phone up and gives mine back to me. I'm playing Dark Souls 2, not thinking much about it. She goes to bed, I stay up gaming for a while.\n\nThe next morning, a guy in our fantasy football chat posts an image of his Squirtle evolving. Somewhere in the back of my head, I seemed to remember a Riley Reid/Squirtle \"Fuck I'm gonna evolve\" meme, so searched for it. Google thinks I meant Riley Reid Squirt\" of course, so I'm instead greeted by pics of Riley violently blasting cum everywhere, so move on with my morning.\n\nMy wife walks into my computer room and says \"I think my phones been hacked, there's someone searching stuff that isn't me\". She shows me her phone, and all the previous search history pops up:\n\nRiley Reid Squirtle Riley Reid Squirt find Darklurker farm giant souls\n\nAs a 36 year old man, worse than being caught with porn is having to prove to your wife that you were actually searching Pok\u00e9mon memes, believe me.\n\nAlso shout-out u/hepatitisC for the perfect meme (which didn't exist at the time) \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/IZZO0Lp.jpg\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr Wife was logged into my phone, tried to find Riley Reid Squirtle meme, got caught being porn and/or Pokemon fan\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify, she was only very confused as to why these searches were on her phone, not angry that I was responsible for them. Trust me, much easier to explain \"oh I was looking for porn\" than \"oh I was looking for Squirtle with this specific woman's face cumvolving because Cody's, a 32 year old man, Squirtle evolved this morning.\"",

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3\u201d03\u2019 tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they\u2019re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it\u2019d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok\u00e9mon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more",

Not only are they in the Dense Biozone group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Bismor chunks are an average of 3\u201d03\u2019 tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they\u2019re large enough to be able handle dwarven dicks, and with their impressive sell price in the Mineral Trade and main element of rocks, you can be rough with it. Due to its mostly rocky based biology, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Bismor would be incredibly hard, so hard that you could easily destroy your cock on it. They can also forge the overclocks Sex (unstable), Arousal (Balanced), Captivate (Clean), Charm (Balanced), and Bash (Unstable), along with not having anything to hide its long orange nipples, so it\u2019d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With its literally just rock so it cannot get tired out. No other mineral comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Bismor turn white. Bismor is literally built for dwarven dick. Ungodly defense stat+high sell price+rockyness means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more",

People can call being disgusted by that as kink shaming, but it really is a foul pleasure no matter how you try justifying it \ud83e\udd22\n\nAnd yes, totally agree if it's people he knows or kids, that's a big no go!\n\nI think people should always do their thing, but with healthy moderation, I think it's healthy that we, on a small scale feel judged by others, or rather, kept in place so extreme individualism doesn't take hold. We reflect in each other's opinions, because that's how we relate to other people, create bonds etc.. I guess the term I'm looking for is social moderation, but in a soft \"what would you think your mother would say\" kind of way (with a tolerant hippie mother) so people don't become too weird.",

However porn just dun do it for me  nor does it for him. We just find new glorious and inventive ways to get each other off multiple times and have an amazing time doing it that we couldn't careless what others look like naked or what others are doing. \n\nBut that's just us \ud83e\udd37 I am ever gonna knock anyone who faps to porn or watches it just to watch it for entertainment. To each his own.\n\nI \ud83d\udcaf agree that it's definitely nothing to hide from your SO either. You're an adult , fap away you little porn freak!!

Nothing about that means that someone's incapable of talking to people IRL or forming a romantic relationship. Like, don't get me wrong, I'm aware that your average weeb stereotype isn't exactly a social butterfly, but coming from someone who hates anime and regularly bashes weeb shit, not everyone into it is a freak and there are plenty of normal people who like that stuff.\n\nJudging someone else for a harmless preference? Yeah, that's just an asshole thing. Hopefully most people can see that and would know better than to sleep with someone like that. Can't imagine what must be going on in someone's head to think less of someone for liking hentai, but they've got serious issues IMO.",

Most families didn't have the means to take in an abused sister or daughter and their kids when things turned dark like that, and one of the components of the abuse was men would get their paychecks, go get blind drunk then come home and get annoyed at their kids and beat them or the wife, usually both though. It was a vicious cycle and prohibition was seen as a good fix for it, but when practiced it was a massive nightmare that absolutly did not work at all.",

Whatever you call what society deems \"normal.\" In my case porn and associated actions are a rare indulgence, used for stress relief or a sleep aid more than anything else. Also, orgasms tend to cure hiccups, so sometimes that. It took years of open communication and discussions with my wife for us to hit the comfort level we have. When I show her things as I mentioned before, it's typically artistic appreciation. There's some really good erotic artists out there.\n\nI mention all that to say this: if she's worth being with, it's worth discussing. Make your position absolutely clear. Make sure she makes her positions perfectly clear. Set absolute boundaries, and stick to them. You will both have to be flexible and compromise, but in the end it will be better for your relationship. You don't have to suffer.\n\nIt's a hard discussion to start, but it's one worth having. Good luck",

I worked at a casino that at the time had about 2,000 employees, so you can probably imagine the room was crowded. I\u2019m on my phone texting my buddy who tells me some story. I thought an appropriate response would be the \u201cfucking amateurs\u201d meme of John Goodman from The Big Lebowski. So I type \u201cfucking amateurs\u201d in google, and let me tel you, I did not get a meme as the return for that search lol. I tried to close my phone as quickly as I could and about accidentally launched it across the room as I panicked.",

I accidentally searched some adult actresses on chrome ( I thought I was in incognito mode). So anyway a few days later and we\u2019re sitting at the bar with some friends and she\u2019s going through her google history to find something she had looked days prior. At the end of it was a few names I had searched. My wife knew they weren\u2019t people she had looked up, she was confused and she begins READING THEM OUT LOUD! Fuck my heart sank.  We\u2019re with two friends and the bartender is pretty close friends with us, and of course they become a little curious about the mystery names . My wife became more curious and clicked one of the names, I was too embarrassed to tell her to stop, I also didn\u2019t want to seem like I knew who the names belonged to and reveal my guilt . By now our friends are pretty invested and they\u2019re watching her browse the newly found mysterious adult content she discovered. I wasn\u2019t saying much and my wife looked at me and asked if I was looking up porn on her phone. It was pretty obvious, and I cracked. Anyway it became a pretty funny moment, and my wife was cool about it.  Now my wife knows what kind of porn I\u2019m into, and she\u2019s just relieved it wasn\u2019t weird shit.",

We bust balls, but all happy great happy relationships.",
