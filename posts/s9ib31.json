Reason being: save money reusing assest from BF1/BFV (*53 Berlin uprising, 56 hungarian revolt, 54 vietnam, 50 Korea, 56 Suez, 55 Algeirs*) two: its an era not commonly used, so it appears \"fresh\" without having to actually change much.\n* Make the only female charachters ones you have to buy, make them young (18yo-24yo) hot looking (no feminist ugly), differnet personalities (like the blond, the redhead, the brunette, asian, black etc). Fanboys will simp buy them.\n* make the game midly ruthless, no pandering to weak players, this seems mean but it will give it a sense of prestige.\n* Limit the Campaign to normal maps with bots, with cut scenes between each, claim it \"teachs people how to play\" which BF fanboys will regurgitate as a positive.\n* Add new \"features\" (that aren't really), like tiny maps with 300 people, or bot mode, front line mode that takes 15 battle maps to win and goes on for 15 hours, maps with 27 objective points.\n\nI think I could make a BF for 1/4 cost, thats still more polished then 2042.",

Producers figured out you can cut costs drastically, make an unfinished alpha/beta test, add in a battle pass + microtransactions and then peddle it off for the same price to the die hard loyal consumers of said franchise/cult who make up most of the end users of the game and will also go on to invest money into cosmetics and battle passes. This is something a new consumer probably wouldn\u2019t do. Ultimately it doesn\u2019t make sense for the owners of an established franchise to invest money into making a good game since increasing cost of production to garner new consumers yields diminishing returns. Instead it makes sense to cut costs by copy/pasting games and use marketing techniques to get existing consumers to basically buy the same game again and again and then buy all the cosmetics and passes again and again. If people were economically intelligent, this practise would never exist, but since they aren\u2019t, predatory game development is something you should anticipate to exist until people wise up and stop buying shit games.",

Hell I don't even watch that much anime but I'd say at least like 60-70% of the total anime fanbase are absolute subhumans. But like you've said those people generally actively dislike the good shit and are often too dumb to even understand the meanings. You look through comment sections discussing amazing series and die a little inside when it's mostly r'etards complaining about how two characters didn't kiss or whatever.\n\nBut the point is at least in Japan the good stuff isn't being *actively filtered* from coming into being at all, which is the sad state of what's become of things in popular Western media for the past half decade or so. It's like this completely sanitized lowest common denominator environment where the only thing that matters is meta-optics with \"representation\" and social messages.\n\nIronically by trying to push this stuff so hard they are ruining the *creative* diversity of media, as everything just converges into the same set of multicultural actors making the same pop culture jokes and conveying the same shallow messages, just dressed up in different costumes as they stick their hands up the asses of established IPs and puppet them for cash and retweets. Because people no longer care about the creative aspect, it's a distant second. It's just a giant circlejerk around a tired facsimile of vicarious empowerment.",

All games have cut features, some even on the level of cyberpunk, the diference is that cyberpunk used said features in interviews and gave hints at such possibilities only to not deliver in the end.\n\nThe bigger issue is that they released a game that didn\u2019t just have bugs, it was straight up broken for many people in many diferent ways. It was a defective product.\n\nCyberpunk is still a decent, if mediocre, product when it\u2019s working fine. It failed hard because it was broken, they can always convince the player base with those promised features later, like No Man\u2019s Sky and Fallout 76 did. (And yes, I personally still hate fallout 76, but the fleshing out of content for those few specific fans who do play and enjoy it is undeniable) \n\nSony pulled it from their storefront FFS. Unprecedented for a game of its supposed caliber.\n\nI highly doubt that any future content Cyberpunk releases will make up for their failure of a launch, but remain open to the idea. That being said it took them so long to fix all the biggest bugs, I have to wonder what the state of the future of the game is.",

Like their problem isn't that they made a game that isn't fun to play, the problem to them is that we aren't buying loot crates and battle passes in a game we aren't enjoying.\n\nThey're speaking as if to share holders, \"disappointing\" means their returns were disappointing, not the gameplay itself. They've progressed so far up their own asses that the product they make is irrelevant to them, it's GAME SEQUEL 5 and GAME SEQUEL 4 made 400m so if 5 only makes 100m then the problem is that we haven't figured out how to trick the idiots out of their money yet, not that they made a game that is objectively unenjoyable when compared even to previous sequels let alone other games being made.\n\nThis is one of the many problems with companies becoming monopolistic and 3 or 4 companies buying all the other game producers. At a certain point they feel  they don't have to try to compete and so don't try to make a good game, but rather a game that will sell. They know \"next biggest competitor studios\" isn't releasing their similar game until 3rd quarter next year, so in their minds they're due all the money and sales until then, and it's completely baffling to them that even tho there are no strong competitors to their shitty title that it isn't earning what they expect \"Generic shooter game sequel 5\" to earn.\n\nIn short, they no longer make games for you and I to enjoy, they make games that they think will make shareholders happy, gamers enjoyability of the game is secondary, the primary concern is that whatever players they do capture will pay out the expected return on the game.",

But Battlefield isn't a new game, it always looks like the old bf3 with nicer pixels and new expansions, it feels like it too (BF1 and 5 had the tone change, so I won't speak for those since what I noticed was a lot of change towards the older war shooters). People want either something new or something better, and 2042 kind of doesn't look like either.\n\nInb4 CoD/Fifa, CoD always tries a bit of new and constantly messes up, but it changes, that's enough. Fifa is, well, the same game I played on ps2, but it gets more polished and more content is added, it doesn't *need* to be new.",
