Some days are super chill get to sit down and relax, other days working on machines all day (which still isn't bad but people still complain) but ya officially \"working\" 9. Still in mill though for the 12 so it does make long days...\n\nUsed to get paid 30 mins of our hour lunch, but big corporate said nope to that. Now you only get paid for time clocked in. (used to get paid 6am-6:30pm) even when shift is just 6-6. Now you have to clock in early or stay late to get that extra 30 mins.",
