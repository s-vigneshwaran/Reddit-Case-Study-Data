  "text": "TIFU by showing my girlfriend my actual strength\nStandard \u2013 this did not happen today. Actually a few years back.\n\nSo, when my then gf and I started dating, I discovered early on that she can be quite physical. In the sense that she likes to push, hold, punch even. Bare in mind she is not actually trying to hurt me, she is just playful like that. I found this both adorable and fun, so I played along.\n\nAnd here is the fuck up\u2026 If she pushed me, I would act like I had to balance myself, or if the bed/sofa was nearby I would fall onto it. If she held me, I would pretend that it was difficult for me to get out of her grip. If I pushed her and she resisted, I would pretend it was hard work, same with me holding her arms etc. You get the idea.\n\nI always assumed she knew I was playing along and not actually physically straining myself to compete with her strength. This went on for months.\n\nOne day, we were chilling on the sofa, watching a show when I realised, I was running late to meet some friends. I told her I need to shower and make a move, she decided this was a good time for a playfight. She sat on top of me to pin my arms under her knees. I played along and \u201cstruggled\u201d to move her off me. A little more \u2018wrestling\u2019 took place, with me playing along like I do. Then I told her I really need to make a move. She was not done and continued to hold/push me back onto the sofa. Eventually I decided I need to \u2018win\u2019 this little fight and get going. So, I got her onto her back, held her hands near her head and leant down to kiss her on the cheeks a few times and let her know again that I am running late.\n\nShe tried to move her arms and could not. Whilst struggling she grunted out. \u2018Why are you so strong today.\u2019\n\nI laughed (fuck up No2) and looked at her like she was joking.\n\nHer eyes went wide with comprehension and she stopped struggling. \u2018You are always this strong?\u2019 She asked, almost to herself.\n\n\u2018Come on babe, you did not really think we are of equal strength, did you?\u2019 I replied.\n\nI then went to take a shower, got ready and as I was heading out the door, I noticed that she might have been a little glum. Me, being fully aware that I do not fully comprehend the mystery of female emotions, had no clue why she was upset. I did what all men do, I guessed. I gave her a kiss and said I won\u2019t be gone for long and that I can pick up her favourite Chinese on the way back. I assumed she was upset about me not spending the afternoon with her.\n\nNo reply. Fuck up No3 \u2013 I should have spent some time talking it through. I instead went on my merry way and had a great fucking time with my friends. She spent the next few hours brewing, simmering, seething, and of course overthinking.\n\nI came home with the Chinese and as soon as I put it down on the dining table, she sprung out of the corner and attacked me. It genuinely surprised me and I reacted by bear hugging her to my chest. She struggled with more force than she normally would and I just held her, I kept asking what was wrong. She gritted her teeth and said. \u2018You lied to me.\u2019 Eventually she stopped trying to fight me and I let her go. She then told me how she feels like I lied to her about our \u2018fights\u2019 and that really all the time I was laughing at her in my head as I pretended that she was actually winning.\n\nI tried to take the conversation seriously, but come on, how the fuck am I supposed to take this seriously. So I may have been somewhat mocking, flirting, and generally being an arse about the whole thing.\n\nA week later she broke up with me. FML\n\nTL;DR I pretended my girlfriend and I we were of equal strength.\n\nEdit 1. Haha this got a lot more attention than I was expecting!\n\nFirstly, there's a lot of she's so \"stupid\", \"crazy\" \"insane\" etc...it's a bit mean. Yeah, she reacted errmm drastically but overall she is a good person.\n\nSecondly, it's shocking how polarizing the comments are. There's a lot of comments along the lines of \"How the fuck did she not know\" and honestly loads of comments from both guys and girls about how girls can be surprised when they first realise the difference in raw strength.\n\nBig shout out to  [u/starbrightstar](https://www.reddit.com/u/starbrightstar) for her comment. It's one of the top comments, and rightly so.",

He really doesn\u2019t get the difference between messing around and trying to kill someone even though he starts it. \n\nJust imagine you randomly to hold someone down, they end up getting you in a hold, and then you respond by actually trying to fight them like it\u2019s serious. That\u2019s him. He takes offense to someone defending themselves and/or beating him so there\u2019s really no way to win other than walking away. Idfthat even works",

Yea he smacked me hard with that wooden katana, bruised the bone on my left arm I used to block and broke a rib with a kick, but I neither felt that or cared, and absolutely pummeled him in return. Surprisingly even in me seeing red I still didn\u2019t *really* hurt him, yea bruised probably at least two thirds of his body and inflicted a shit ton of pain, but didn\u2019t break anything. He got really tentative to fuck with me after that. Still used the damn belts / sticks.\n\nMy sister also eventually had a lesser face the music moment where she was \u201cpinning\u201d me per usual, but then someone came over that I really wanted to go with, so I just kinda picked her up with one arm like how you can take off a tshirt onehanded (from her head locking me) and carried her back to her room in said hand.

So it always wound up with him eventually inflicting some actual pain by biting or scratching, me getting mad and using more force than was necessary, him crying, and then me getting in trouble with his mother and my parents.\n\nEventually, I managed to solve the problem by getting him in a fairly stable and gentle full nelson whenever he started one of these tussles, and then slowly getting us both to the ground so he just couldn't move very well. Even if he struggled, he just wouldn't have enough range of motion to hurt me or himself. After a few of these, he just got bored and stopped the tussles altogether. Dunno if that would solve your problem, but it wound up saving me some hassle.",

Haha\".\n\nBut then I noticed when we were out she's be like \"I could totally beat up that guy or that guy etc...\" So I was like before she does something dangerous and actually fights some random I should tell her/show her the actual strength difference.\n\nSexual dimorphism is a hell of a thing.",

I assumed he was stronger than me but didn't realize how much until we arm wrestled and I told him to not hold back. \n\nI asked since in high school I beat a guy at arm wrestling (both arms) and he was so embarrassed but competitive that it actually motivated him to work out until he could beat me. He actually ended up getting in excellent shape too! He was a good sport even when he kept losing but you could tell he wasn't thrilled that a scrawny woman beat him, especially since we were competitive with our math scores. I played sports and trained daily and he didn't work out at all. From what I understand he just did push-ups as much as he could and it beefed up his arms fast lol. I neglect working on my arms so it wasn't long until he caught up.\n\nBut yeah it was a bummer when I realized how much stronger my ex was in comparison and I also had a similar realization play-wrestling with my current bf. My current bf is a little chubby and he doesn't work out so I was shocked that he was SO much stronger still. The thing that scares me isn't that someone I date could physically overpower me, since he's a sweet person and wouldn't hurt me. The scary thing is it is a reminder that probably like 90% of the men I encounter in my life could and that there are some horrible people out there and I could get killed, attacked, or mugged easily and stand no chance.",

I mean most people are right handed, so why would anything be designed otherwise?  Well, jars were designed a long time ago - before robots.  That's why.\n\nWhat!  What do robots have to do with anything?\n\nYou don't sell jars to consumers - you sell them to factories that put things into jars.  Your actual market isn't people **opening** jars, it's people **closing** jars. So a jar manufacturer is going to sell a product that allows their customers the ability to close as many jars as possible - ergo they are right handed (for closing).\n\nNowadays, it is robots that close jars. Purpose built jar closing machines.  These presumably could run in either clockwise or widdershins directions without problem.  Handedness of jars nowadays only refers to opening of jars, because that's the only time it is done by hand (I mean I guess we close them again after we get our pickles, but it's really only that first opening which breaks the vacuum seal that's the issue). It would make sense nowadays to reverse the direction for jar lids, but we don't do that because of the confusion it would cause.  Everybody knows which direction  jar lids open.\n\nAnd that's how we got left handed jar lids. Or at least that's my theory of it - and it's a theory with robots, so it must be right.",

I am 165 and can deadlift 450 (at least last time I maxed.) That's about 2.72 times my bodyweight. My buddy can lift 560 but weighs  220 so he's at 2.24 times his bodyweight. \n\nWho's stronger? Science says me but flat numbers it's him and in the real world we wouldn't be in the same weight class so it wouldn't matter. \n\nComparing numbers is a terrible indicator once you have a different sized person.

She Was dealing with addiction issues and had just about given up all hope.  She had been couchsurfing and hooking for drug money before she moved in with us.  She was actually shooting coke, which is probably more deadly than heroin as it's super easy to go into seizures and OD on,  She had been in the ER 3 times already in the last 18 months preceding this incident..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  We had gotten her enrolled in outpatient treatment and she had been clean for about two weeks when I came home one day and found her in my master bedroom trying to find a vein with a syringe.  She jumped up off the bed and tried to run to the bathroom and I grabbed her by the arm she was using to hold the syringe and jerked her towards me and i easily took the syringe out of her hands.  I then let her go and she just freaked and locked herself in the bathroom and started yelling and screaming and crying.  I called my wife and told her what was going on and asked her to hurry home.  My wife finally came home and after talking to her through the door for an hour finally got her to come out.  Now I have always been a big teddy  bear and am never violent but apparently she was terrified of me because I had so easily taken the syringe away from her while she was trying to fight me off.  My wife assured her that I would never have tried to hurt her but she was very wary of me until she finally got completely clean. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Later after getting clean she told me that incident was what tipped her over to really getting clean.  I asked how so? She said that she knew that if I could have fought her off so easily then she knew she would end up dead on the streets if she kept using.  She said she had physical fights with other men but had always managed to fight them off and run away and with me she was utterly at my mercy,  and that she would eventually run into someone else who did the same but was actually intent on hurting her.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood news is,  she just got her 5 year chip and has a good job,  and I'm still her favorite cousin!",

His style feels irritating. \n\nBUT then I see comments like this in the wild and feel like I would be missing out otherwise. The whole Way of Kings has been a slog. I wish he wrote like Brom or Rothfuss. \n\nI really like the concept and the general story/plot, but his style of writing is irritating for me. Does this get better?\n\nI stuck it out for the whole first novel, and I love the community online, but does his writing change significantly?\n\nLike I said, I enjoyed Lost Gods by Brom, and The Kingkiller by Rothfuss.",

I will say the plot develops quite significantly and in satisfying fashion so it still may be worth trying to get through them.\n\nI felt the same way you are describing about Neil Stephenson when I read Cryptonomicon.\n\nYou might try the Expanse series, I really enjoyed those and felt it might address some of your issues.

She had been working out but she was still this tiny little 5'2 <100 lbs woman that I could literally hold off by just using one hand without even trying. One day she caught me off guard and threw a kick that was going towards my boys so I instintively brushed her leg up and she lost her balance, landing on her ass and hitting her head on the cabinet. \n\nThankfully, she was okay cause she quipped \"you really gave my ass a pounding...\" she got me back later that day by kicking me in the butt as I was walking towards a door, my stride along with the momentum caused me to walk into the door face first. She made the most satisfied gremlim laugh noises after that.",

Definitely attacking OP is not the way to go, and I'm not saying OP should stay in a relationship like that either.

I think we both agree that her feeling the way that she does is valid. I also did say that her \"definitely attacking OP is not the way to go,\" so I think we both agree that her creating a false justification to blame others is also not okay. When I said she needs support, I meant emotional support and possibly therapy, not support for her actions. Her behavior is unhealthy but was most likely caused out of fear and lack of control rather than hatred for OP. What I am saying is that demonizing her for that is not going to help her realize what she did is wrong. She needs help and support from her loved ones and possibly a therapist (Note that I am not saying that OP has to stay in this relationship to help her) to help her process what she is going through and learn healthier ways to handle her feelings. \n\nI also think this is a common problem with mental health issues. People are quick to say how much they care about mental health and support mental health awareness. However, when people actually see signs of mental health issues, they are quick to judge without ever thinking for a second that maybe the last thing those people need at that moment is judgment. I'm not saying to give every person with health issues a free pass, but I also think you can say that you disagree with someone's actions without calling them a crazy bitch for it, too.",

However, that doesn't change the fact that demonizing them or calling them crazy is not going to help them at all. \n\nAlso, I guess we just live in different environments because people from where I'm from would be able to know that I meant \"support\" as in emotional support and therapy rather than support of a cause (or actions) in my original comment, especially since I did note that her attacking OP was not the right thing for her to do. Since I basically stated that I do not support her actions, it wouldn't really make sense for me to use the word \"support\" in a \"support her actions\" kind of way immediately after in the last sentence of my first comment, right?\n\nAll I'm trying to say (and my original comment was about this too) is don't be mean. I don't understand why that is so difficult. Yes, you can say that you think she made the wrong choices and actions. Yes, OP doesn't need to stay in a relationship with her. Yes, OP is not obliged to help or support her. Yes, this is her mental health problem, and nobody is required to help her. However, just because she is wrong does not mean people have to attack her.  While most comments seem to keep it at just disagreeing with her or saying that she was in the wrong (which is perfectly fine!), it seems like a couple of comments are going further and just hating on her. \n\nI think it's just important to have compassion, and I think you can have compassion while believing she made the wrong choices. Disagreeing with somebody's actions and compassion aren't mutually exclusive.",

It is a term of common speech, with specific definitions as used in such fields as the law, medicine, research, and sexual relationships. Consent as understood in specific contexts may differ from its everyday meaning. For example, a person with a mental disorder, a low mental age, or under the legal age of sexual consent may willingly engage in a sexual act that still fails to meet the legal threshold for consent as defined by applicable law.",

There's no fear whatsoever. Honestly it's almost a criteria for me to be attracted to them; gotta be *S T R O N G*\n\n\nSo I hope guys will ask their partners, cause you could be missing out on an easy guaranteed way to turn your wife on.

Since we have a 'fun' sexual relationship, she asked me if I thought I could initiate sex with her trying to actively prevent it without getting up.  And I told her I was certain I could get her on, negate the clothing barrier, and begin the deed, despite her protests.  Naturally she challenged me to do so.  Naturally, I took that challenge, and what happened next I will never forget.\n\nShe was anticipating some kind of wrestling match or some such that would be pretty even, but somewhat in my favor strength-wise, somewhat in hers based on position and leverage.  What -actually- happened was a lot simpler: I just reached over, grabbed her waist, lifted her up, and put her where I wanted her.  The look of stunned shock at how fast it was just done and over was fairly profound.  As we continued, she told me, \"...so, I kind of expected that I might be able to put up a fight and get away or at least make it harder for you, but I never had a chance.\"\n\nAs things proceeded, she would make attempts to see if she could \"get away\", lifting a hip or trying to move to one side to get off, etc.  after a while, she just gave up.  Her conclusion: if I was a legitimate assailant and decided I was going to attack her sexually, she either gets away fast, or she's just done for.  That, kids, is the day my wife truly came to understand the difference between a fairly strong 5'4\" woman and a very strong 5'11\" man.\n\nDisclaimers: strength is a function of the conditioning of an individual body, and I fully recognize the real possibility of a smaller woman being stronger than a larger man by virtue of training and hard work.  Also, no bratty subs were harmed during the making of this memory, and all activities were consensual, even the \"non-consensual\" portions.  Please misbehave responsibly.",

She's a good fighter and attractive, so the male lead, a complete beginner in fighting, is quite interested in her while she ignores him. He's just another guy who thinks less of her as a woman anyway. She found her chosen family in the regulars at her fight club. She agrees to train the newbie who learns fast and even gets in a hit or two after multiple training sessions - she still gives him the cold shoulder though. \n\nBut when the owner of the club gets murdered and her chosen brother gets kidnapped by a group of criminals wanting to extort information from said brother, she teams up with the guy and he proves to be a real keeper. They rescue her brother, hold a traditional maoi funeral with hakas and everything, the last scene is them cuddling on the beach and the camera pans away to a beautiful sunset.",

Can you for an example pull a gun on a drunk person thats spouting crazy shit from a distance?\n\nI realize laws may depend on the specific state, but if its not, and they have to actually get in a position thats dangerous for you in order for it to be considered self defence, wouldnt that mean that they are only like one step away or already in your face, pretty much nullifying the advantage of a gun in the first place in a lot of cases? Not to mention if you dont notice them/their intentions before they are already next to you. Just some thoughts.",

(It was a kick meant to hit something going up so you'd imagine that if it bumped into something infront of it with just the tip it wouldn't do much damage) and after that I just ran since the guy was atleast 3 weight classes above me, so I figured he wouldn't beat me in a running match and thus I avoided getting hurt. But maybe he was just that much heavier than me, and he was 2 years older.",

(Fun for me at least, and that's all that matters)\n\nYou might notice that if you get a pain inside your abdomen or chest, the pain tends to be diffuse and dull(there are a few exceptions) compared to the pain you get on your skin, bones muscles, which tends to be sharper, more localisable, and from experience you know that you feel hits to those areas instantly.\n\nThe first kind is called visceral pain(viscera meaning organs) and the second type is somatic pain. These are transmitted by different fibres. And the visceral ones are unmyelinated (they are uninsulated and therefore slower) and low density. Somatic, the opposite.\n\nNow while your penis, as an external organ is innervated for somatic pain (if someone poked it with a compass, you'd know exactly where it was), when you were a foetus the testes started their journey inside your abdomen, and were guided out through your inguinal canal, while doing so they bring with them a protective layer from inside your abdomen called the peritoneum. That layer is still innervated like it is up in your belly.\n\nThis is why when you get whacked there:\n1. It has a delay before you really feel it\n2. The pain feels like it goes all the way up in your abdomen.",

The punch was full power and a direct hit, but the rush of adrenaline knowing I was in a real fight really dampened the pain.  For the next 5-10 seconds, I was ready to throw down...which was too bad, because he was already out the door and there were cops out front.  If I had run out and gone after him, they would never have believed my account.\n\nAll that being said, after the initial adrenaline rush wore off, the resulting pain was truly awful.",

There\u2019s always something to practice no matter who you\u2019re training with. \n\nYou\u2019re right though, you learn more when sparring with people better than you. But if you join a gym, unless you\u2019re a beginner, it\u2019s not fair to refuse sparring with people of a lower skill than you. You can\u2019t expect the better people to help you if you don\u2019t help the people who aren\u2019t as good as you. (Not that I\u2019m accusing you of having the wrong mentality, I\u2019m just tryna add on to the convo)\n\nThere also a difference between sparring with a woman in a gym and beating a woman on the street or at home. Refusing to spar with a woman because she\u2019s a woman is pretty insulting to women. \n\nI\u2019ve helped to train women. Ive been trained by women. Ive seen tiny women outpace significantly larger men in the ring. I\u2019ve worked physically demanding jobs with 100lbs women who can outpace 200lbs men. They\u2019d all be rightfully insulted if a man ever refused to work with them",

Hard to get a good hit in a real situation. BUT you mentioned flinch reaction - balls are good for that. Meaning that almost everyone has a reaction when something is about to hit your balls. You pull your legs together and push your arse back and lower your upper body. So a fast slap towards the balls is a good opener for next attack. Imagine that I have my right hand down, I slap fast towards opponent balls. That flinch happens and that opens up other targets, like a left elbow to the head or several fast palm strikes to the head or ear area. \n\nThroat or larynx/trachea is a good target in a real life and death situation. Even relative easy punch with fist or area between your thumb and index finger will produce a gag reflex, little harder and you might actually kill him.",

I pulled my legs up enough to kick him off of me and kick him in throat/chest so I could run away. I basically just put my feet together and kicked him as hard as I could and SCREAMED. He was kind of a wimpy skinny high school kid but as a 95 lb 14 year old girl he was still much bigger and stronger than me. It's still a little bit of a blur but I know his hand never made it all the way up my shirt like he was trying to. Fuck that guy. I heard later he had trouble breathing for a while and had to use his inhaler, etc. I wasn't sorry. I will never forget the realization that if he managed to pin me down all the way there was NOTHING I could do to stop him.",

If you're a guy of somewhat average fitness, your grip strength is roughly comparable to female Olympic powerlifters. For distance running, there's probably a grandmother within a mile radius of your location that could outrun you.\n\nPoint being, men on average are *much* stronger, but only a little faster, compared to women.",

However, in a survival situation, things are different. Same vibe as when a gazelle outmaneuvers a cheetah, who is way faster in any sort of scientific study. The cheetah is running for a meal, the gazelle is running for its life. Sometimes the gazelle wins. It does a lot of dodging and twisting, and sometimes just a full-out sprint. The extraordinary amount of adrenaline produced when your brain decides that you\u2019ll either run or die can move the odds in favor of the prey. If I had to choose between outfighting a larger, stronger person or outrunning them, I\u2019d run every time. It\u2019s difficult to beat someone stronger when you fight them, even with adrenaline, because they usually have more muscle to work with and they\u2019re also strung out on adrenaline. But if you run? Unless they\u2019re trained as a runner with excellent cardiovascular fitness, you can definitely win because your adrenaline usually sends all of your energy to your legs and heart (citation needed lol). You don\u2019t need an extraordinary amount of muscle to run, most of it comes from your heart and lungs. I ran cross country in high school and everyone was a fuckin bean pole. If two people are of average fitness but one of them is being chased, I\u2019d put my money on them",

Unless you can literally smash every bit of a man\u2019s manhood, not going to be an effective getaway tactic.\n\nI\u2019m a Marine, our martial arts program is called MCMAP (Marine Corps Martial Arts Program). It\u2019s designed for fighting in a full combat load with the intent of being able to overpower and maim your opponent, if CQC became the last option. It incorporates a lot of fighting styles, but it\u2019s always heavily recommended to pursue other training. Jujitsu and Krav Maga are very popular in the infantry community. I\u2019ve also had the honor of training with many other fighting forces, and one in particular is kind of the point of my comment. \n\nYou\u2019ll find a lot of Middle Eastern militaries have a groin strike as their opening attack in a fight. This isn\u2019t meant to incapacitate, but instead create a window. You\u2019ll immediately put a male opponent into a defensive position (literally grabbing his groin) whether or not your strike makes contact. It gives you a great opportunity to land a truly devastating attack. The best thing I recommend for a woman is an eye gouge. It\u2019s as simple as spreading your four digits, keeping your fingers slightly bent so they don\u2019t break, and attempting to reach into an individual\u2019s face and hooking his eye sockets. If you know what facemasking is in football terms, imagine that. Or YouTube it and watch some clips. It will give a person a great chance to run, or whatever the case may be.",

The best bet would be to keep em at a distance cause that's where the advantage is but that's hard if they know what they're doing.",

She was a legit multiple time champion, I\u2019d been training for about a year and a half at that point. She was way better than me, but it didn\u2019t matter because I\u2019m a big dude, 6\u20190, probably around 225 at the time and stocky, and she was maybe 5\u20190, probably no more than 100 lbs. I was pretty much able to just walk right through everything she threw at me and anything I was able to land would wobble her. She\u2019s a champion fighter, but if I\u2019d actually been trying to hurt her, I could have and it wouldn\u2019t have been difficult.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason combat sports have weight classes. Good technique helps you compete with a bigger, stronger opponent, but only to a point. If your opponent is literally twice your size, you\u2019re gonna have a bad time unless they\u2019re completely clueless about how to fight (and even then, they can kinda just push you over and sit on you. The ol\u2019 big brother lol).",

No live sparring with resistance really takes away any realism. Sure, maybe there's something to the concepts but it has to be tried and tested using sparring with resistance. If you're looking at throws, judo here is a much better option(ironically has very big overlap with bjj). \n\nI don't know as much about Silat and Krav Maga but again the key here is sparring with resistance for effectiveness. I'm not sure as to the efficacy of these if this isn't practiced. While I don't think that MMA is the be all and end all for real combat, I do think it's one of the closer approximations we have. If we look at the dominant arts there, I don't know if there are any practitioners with significant Silat and Krav Maga experience. I know these arts have 'lethal' techniques which aren't typically allowed such as eye gouging and groin shots but remember that in a real fight that these can be used by other practitioners too, often much more harshly if the other person is stronger. The other thing is that these techniques can't be practiced with full resistance.",

I am overall a lot stronger than her even if I can\u2019t do a headstand or keep my body weight in my arms (think yoga stuff).

To obtain epidemiologically relevant hand-grip strength data for pre-employment screening, we determined maximal isometric hand-grip strength in 1,654 healthy men and 533 healthy women aged 20-25 years. Moreover, to assess the potential margins for improvement in hand-grip strength of women by training, we studied 60 highly trained elite female athletes from sports known to require high hand-grip forces (judo, handball). Maximal isometric hand-grip force was recorded over 15 s using a handheld hand-grip ergometer. Biometric parameters included lean body mass (LBM) and hand dimensions. Mean maximal hand-grip strength showed the expected clear difference between men (541 N) and women (329 N). Less expected was the gender related distribution of hand-grip strength: 90% of females produced less force than 95% of males. Though female athletes were significantly stronger (444 N) than their untrained female counterparts, this value corresponded to only the 25th percentile of the male subjects. Hand-grip strength was linearly correlated with LBM. Furthermore, both relative hand-grip strength parameters (F (max)/body weight and F (max)/LBM) did not show any correlation to hand dimensions. The present findings show that the differences in hand-grip strength of men and women are larger than previously reported. An appreciable difference still remains when using lean body mass as reference. The results of female national elite athletes even indicate that the strength level attainable by extremely high training will rarely surpass the 50th percentile of untrained or not specifically trained men.",

IIRC it's 1ng/kg testosterone in the bloodstream for women on average that the surrenal glands make up, and 7ng/kg testosterone for men on average (surrenal glands + leydig cells).\n\nSo there isn't much else in the Y chr that helps making the difference",

Men have a much higher proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers, which exert more force than slow-twitch ones. That last one is why even a skinny man with low muscle mass will still be stronger than 90% of women.",

It's harder to carry groceries, riding a bike up a hill takes a lot more exertion, moving furniture becomes a real chore; just about any task requiring strength increases in difficulty. It becomes very apparent very quickly how much of a strength difference exists between bodies with and without testosterone.",

It's pretty simple. Sure, 90% of women weigh far less than man, but that shows, yes mass is a big factor, men are not just more muscular but generally more overweight.\n\n\\> the proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers. Men have a much higher proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers, which exert more force than slow-twitch ones.\n\nWhat? lol Men just build up more muscle, more easily. But you can still just gain weight to heighten your muscle mass with it. The kind of muscle composition is based on your training and intake.",

A real 'Brienne of Tarth' sort. She was state champion in TKD in her bracket in her teens and, frankly, demolished the more average sized women with what I'd describe as brute force and intimidation.\n\nAnd I have no issue overpowering her.\n\nIt's a mammalian trend, though, not just humans.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4285578/\n\nEven the makeup of muscles between genders is different. Male muscles have higher contraction force and speed, and women have better endurance and fatigue recovery, as a result of different percentages of muscle fibre types and the interactions of various hormones, testosterone and estrogen primarily.\n\nThis is, I expect, part of why old world militaries extensively used mares for their cavalry.\n\nEither way, to give the woman a physical advantage you don't go pound for pound. You go pound for pound and a half, or two pounds, or a hell of a gulf in training level, or give them a weapon, like a taser, because those things don't fuck around.\"\n\nGive the link a look. Gender differences are pretty extreme.",

And in kindergarten, things were pretty fair - about the same heights, weights, fitness etc. By the time secondary school here started (10/11 years old) there were already starting to emerge very clear differences. Still mostly same height, but the boys were just a touch \"denser\"/heavier and only the really well-trained, tall girls could win against average boys. And that was before puberty. By the end of high school (19), I was pretty tall for a woman, like 5'10\" or something. So the height differences to a lot of guys were of course smaller to non-existant for me. Especially since a lot of boys haven't finished growing yet at that age. I was young, did a lot of sports and willing to fight dirty, but even guys smaller than me, with a lower level of fitness could mop the floor with me during mock fights in PE. My friend wanted to become a professional firefighter and had to give up, because even super well trained she just couldn't manage the physical \"entrance test\". Other friend, military, just barely managed but had to quit boot camp because she just couldn't keep up enough. Even in e-sports men tend to have an edge, because of reaction time/movement speed. And, yes, it sucks hardcore. It goes against every feminist \"women, too, can do everything men can do\" talking point ever made. I fucking hate it! But I can't believe there are still people arguing against this shit.",

I knew men were generally stronger, but I had no idea how much stronger until she started joking about tough guys who do push-ups and stuff. Something about the way she said \"push-ups and stuff\" made me dig a little deeper. Turned out she thought anything over 5 push-ups was ridiculously strong. I was like \"no way, you could do at least 5 right now.\" Long story short, she couldn't. She could barely do two. She appeared to be in excellent shape too. I was astounded.",

I'd say with enough time on hormones that transgender women end up being at the same strength levels you would expect to see in cisgender women. A few mentioned they were really prone to accidental injuries for a while, because they were so used to being stronger before.\n\nI actually have one friend in particular I met before she realized she was trans, and after a few years on hormones all of the muscles she had when in \"boy mode\" prior were absolutely gone. She was really frustrated trying to open jars at that point, lol.\n\nHonestly though? The entire topic is really more complex than this. Many of the top scoring cisgender female athletes have naturally higher testosterone levels as well. I'm not sure if there's really an easy cut and dry answer to this because of that factor. Bodies are wildly unique and everyone's reacts differently to hormones, whether they're store bought or their own body's pre-made mix.",

I thought I had zero reading comprehension, but no it's just you.\n\nAnd just to play along with what you said. Just because someone doesn't \"get it\" doesn't mean you shouldn't try to explain. You're the one acting stuck up trying to say things like \"I'm having a hard time explaining, so I won't, I'm going to agree with you that our parents sucked and you're different, I'm getting out\". It sounded more like you accidentally taking OP's comment personally. Imagine if a teacher said that. Well, quit being a teacher in the first place then.",

You\u2019re truly not like other girls.\n\nWtf?? No, I don't think I'm superior to other women. I also don't think I'm a cool girl or anything like that - I think that the whole \"cool girl\" shtick and telling girls they're as strong as guys is damaging because it leads to women not realizing how much stronger men are in reality. It's important that every girl is aware of this from a young age and she doesn't even remember a time when she wasn't aware. \n\nNow whether women should get upset is a separate matter. I don't think biology has to be upsetting - it just is. Men can easily overpower women but those who actually use their strength against women are rightfully shunned by society. Boys are rightfully told to never hit a girl. Boys and men are rightfully called cowards if they fight girls or women because everyone knows it's not equal. Of course, in many cultures, husbands are expected to beat and rape their wives, which is a major way in which women are oppressed by men.\n\nPhysiologically, men and women are different. Women are more vulnerable for obvious reasons. But men die younger, they are less healthy and more prone to fatal illnesses and fatal accidents. So women are weaker when it comes to brute force but stronger when it comes to vitality and health.",

If your sick stay home, if you have to go out, wearing a mask is appreciated and not stigmatic.  But no politics have to find every wedge issue and force people to pick sides.  \n\nMy boss is a huge Democrat, got the vax, pushed masks, then stopped after the vax.  Then the CDC said put masks back on, vax aint working as well as we hoped.  Haven't seen him wear a mask in 9 months, he was in here coughing up a lung, nothing he couldn't do from home.  Still showed up to work because dammit thats what guys do, you always show up to work even when sick.  \n\nSo yes I agree with you common decency would ask you to put on a mask if your sick, and stay home if sick.  But the decision was ripped out of our hands and given to politicians to make political points.  So masks turned into symbols, and I don't think you will ever get it back.",

The ones that do hit the news because they've broken a record, the ones that don't don't make the news and nobody talks about them. CeCe didn't win all the races she ran that day, she didn't even place in more than one other competition. She did well that season because she's fast and she trained hard. The next person to break her record is statistically likely to be a cisgender woman. Mary Gregory trains a ridiculous amount, it's right in the article you posted. Rachel McKinnon's major competition, the woman who beat her in the qualifier, withdrew from the race she set a record in, missing out on the opportunity to set that record herself. Hannah Mouncey finished her season second behind a cisgender woman. \n\nThese are all exemplary athletes who have more to prove than the average sportswoman and work their asses off training, as well as being athletically gifted. Other women who break records are the same; top notch athletes who are hungry enough for victory to make it happen. For every victorious transgender athlete there are many more who didn't make it.\n\nWe don't actually know how many transgender athletes are competing in collegiate sports. There's no official record of it, and no studies have been done. But there are scores of known transgender athletes competing on college sports teams and they don't make the news because they're not breaking records or utterly dominating the sport the way people think they they must. The truth is that the medical industry knows what they're talking about and hormone treatment does indeed fundamentally change someone's physical traits to what they would be if they'd been born with a reproductive system matching their brain structure, and treating outliers as the rule in order to make an issue of it is just plain alarmist thinking.",

I knew as a big guy that my disadvantages against little dudes was they were faster, had better stamina, and were bonier (i.e. bony ass knuckles). My advantages were I knew my weaknesses and how someone would capitalize, my endurance, and ability to absorb punishment, and the ability to dish punishment out.\n\n1.)

Let him try to land said blow and maybe even let it land.....cuz when he does he is in range for me to get ahold of him and taking a blow or 2 that i can absorb is worth grappling them.\n\n3.) Use the environment to my advantage. Like I said i don't wanna box....so I'd rather pick you up and slam you through things or just toss ya head first at something solid.\n\n4.) If 3 isn't possible....drop on top of said foe. The old big brother routine. Just sit on ur chest and wail on ya at my leisure\n\nThis being said i have never been in a full on fight in my 34 years but i did get in a small scrape with a buddy once. He tried to headbutt me and i dodged out of reflex and when i realized he had tried to hit me i put him in a headlock and locked my hands. He tried to bite my arm and that only made me squeeze harder, then he tried yanking on my balls so i pulled the ol big brother headlock variant. After i let him up he tried once more and i pinned him up against a wall by his throat and told him he was going back to his room and he was gonna stay there till he calmed down (we were roommates at the time) and he did and that was that.",

Zero-to-absolute-apeshit, targeting something that is at least temporarily debilitating, and utilizing the environment (use a pencil, knock a bookshelf over, etc.). Try as much as possible to not give physical cues prior to the apeshit. Apeshit means willing to permanently disable or kill, not give what amounts to a \u201cwarning shot\u201d with something like a punch. A punch, even if I\u2019m in top physical form, is not going to matter if I\u2019m in a real situation.\n\nI blame Hollywood for reinforcing the idea that the gap is smaller than it is in terms of raw power. Sure, I\u2019d expect most women to KNOW that they\u2019d lose, but I feel like the extent of the loss might be watered down in their minds after a lifetime of ingesting media that portrays things differently and living around men who aren\u2019t going around displaying their strength. I\u2019ve always known my husband is stronger than me, it was never a question in my mind despite the fact that he\u2019s kind of wire-y. But I never knew just *how* insane the power imbalance is until he suffered severe head trauma and went through a period of being angry and aggressive (not toward me) while still recovering. He destroyed a table, pieces exploding everywhere, with what looked like no effort at all\u2026 like just slamming his fist down. It was unbelievable.",

I'm thinking about some videos where people get into a fight and just strip, writing their opponent out enough to be unwilling to continue the fight.

We play wrestled as well and she decided to go all out when I was only using like 50% of my strength. She put me in a headlock and I was acting like it wasn't a big deal, then she like went full force because she didn't like me laughing like I wasn't in a vulnerable position. I ripped her arms from my neck because I was actually not able to breath and spun around ontop of her and pinned both her arms down. It all happened in 3 seconds.\n\nNot gonna lie, I did try to pull her arms with less strength at first and I couldn't, so she might have been able to choke out a weaker guy, but she learned quickly there wasn't a thing she could do if I was serious. There's just a huge gap physically between the average male and female, and I'm not the average male in terms of size. Weight classes exist for a reason and that's for men fighting other men, so you can only imagine how difficult it would be for a woman to go up against a guy that has 80lbs on them. \n\nBeen together 3 years since that incident, and we don't ever go full tilt on play wrestling anymore since then haha.",

I wrestled for 8ish years, and if you stick to the rules then a difference of ~10lbs is nearly insurmountable with equal skill, but there are some (illegal) leverage moves that can seriously damage a person and require only speed and technique. You pit someone's own joints and strength against them, attack the ligaments and soft tissue, and avoid direct confrontation.\n\nThe other thing people forget to do is get an improvised weapon. Rocks are hard as shit and great for smashing faces. Sticks can double your reach, and something sharp can kill with very little force if you hit important bits.",

The way they intuitively used their weight to out-leverage me when the sparring hit the mat was unreal. It was like fighting a blanket.\n\nBut, honestly, those guys are the exception that proves the rule, really. That kind of martial art was invented for that specific use - so that lighter people could still effectively defend themselves in a messy fight where the opponent is larger and stronger.",

At like a school, not just a \"women's self defense\" one off deal. It's a lot of fun and can build tons of confidence. You may never get strong enough to take on a man in a real one on one fight, but you'll build all the tools you need to get away, which is always the goal.\n\nKeep in mind that self defense isn't a bag of tricks. It's not just moves you learn, it's actual training, improving the strength you can in the places you need it, and breaking bad habits so you can use that new strength when you need it. It won't be a quick turn around thing. But it's probably the most beneficial hobby you could pick up.",

Biologically it gets more complicated, only a touch. I did a college English paper on a controversial sibject(as was required for the assignment and I got a 100) on the subject of women serving on the front lines. The basis of my paper was biological makeup.\n\nMen naturally produce a lot of testosterone through a large chunk of our lives. Again our frames are bigger, our overall mass is typically larger, our bones are more dense and so are our muscles. Male bodies tend to adapt to a higher stress load placed upon it better than a females, for instance going from basic training to special ops training or any form of endoc. I don't have any specific evidence related to muscle supply provided by the body, but in most pictures you see of really fit men, the veins tend to be more pronounced, and often appear more numerous. Female body builders, from what I'm able to tell by looking, don't have as efficient an adaptation mechanism to supply nutrients and oxygen to overly worked tissues.",

Spirit bomb is usually pretty easy to dodge, but the boomerang and arrow together will stack damage fast.  \n\nIke and DK are both too slow to be able to out-position him, while being big targets for the ranged attacks. They're heavy and have big, sweeping attacks though, which makes them *feel* good to play. I typically play as Ike when I'm playing with less skilled players and want to be able to tank a lot of hits and give them opportunities to see attacks coming.\n\nMarth can be defeated at range or up close since his sword does max damage only at the tip and he has no ranged attacks. Marth players will typically try to keep you from closing with them by countering (Down + B) when you do so, but this can itself be countered by grabbing, which bypasses counters and shields. \n\nI haven't played Marth in Brawl much, but hit me up in a DM if you want to try playing online a bit for practice - I need an excuse for more Smash!",

Of course the actual fact is not important, the strength level is not important either.\n\nI do agree that his reaction to her moment was not favorable, I just don't at all think it was from a mocking sexist point of view, I think it was simple incredulity. She might as well have said \"wait ... The sky is really blue??\"\n\nPersonally from what we saw here she's got some extreme insecurity issues and projects like mad when upset.

Then one day while watching a documentary that's going over scientific fact about the moon and the one who really believes the running joke scoffs and makes a comment about how it's definitely made of cheese. The other person chuckles and makes a comment but in the way you reference a joke between two people rather than with serious conviction, and the one who really believe the joke for truth picks up on that and suddenly explodes on the person for not genuinely believing the moon is made of cheese, you know?\n\nLike the topic just has to have both feet on the ground to begin with to really use common sense and logic. If an adult woman genuinely thought that an adult male who is presumably her size or bigger wasn't significantly stronger than her to begin with, she's already not playing with a full deck of cards but to react the way she did with such a significant level of insecurity and assuming the most insidious worst in her significant other?

Unless she\u2019s like specifically someone doing intensive strength training, she should realize that it\u2019s highly unlikely for her to be as physically strong or stronger.\n\nSo\u2026 I\u2019m not seeing the fuck up.

Certainly, it shouldn\u2019t be the goal or something you **intend** to do.

Why did you think that?\u201d\n\nIdk\u2026 this seems like a bad sitcom writing premise so I doubt it\u2019s real.

It can also really hurt when your body starts to panic and struggle for freedom. If your body chooses to respond to that panic by entering fight or flight mode, it can be extremely difficult/impossible to \"yield\" and ask to be released.\n\nAlso play fighting is normal to some degree in all young mammals [but it's much much more common for males.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1449641/) Guys, please take note. The vast overwhelming majority of women are not natural play-wrestlers. Not the way you are. Many of us learn to enjoy it, but it's a very different experience for us. Please be respectful of that. If you play-wrestle with your girlfriend or wife, do so with extreme care and mindfulness and stop immediately if she shows distress.",

It\u2019s EBT day, and we\u2019re running out of paper bags at the first checkout counter. What do I do? I walk over to the pallet of paper bags they have at the front, squat, and lift. Security guard asked if I needed any help, I said I\u2019m good.\n\nWhen I got to the checkout counter, ripped the bag open, and get them what they needed, I saw how much the bag weighed. \n\n80 lbs. Now, I know that\u2019s not necessarily a lot, but it\u2019s also not a little. It felt totally different than 80 lbs in weights because I was able to get a good squat and grip on it, but I genuinely surprised myself that day.",

Back in my hoodlum days when men started throwing punches I'd back up and find a safe perch to watch from.  Women who try to get between men fighting are out of their mind.  Even standing close is a no-no because men tend to cover a LARGE amount of area while fighting.\n\nI've been in physical altercations with women and when you are actively *fighting* with someone you develop complete tunnel vision.  The person getting between you trying to break it up can be the person you love the most in the world and you won't recognize them, they just become another threat.  Same goes for men.  He's not going to recognize who you are and magically stop because he sees you in front of him.  He doesn't see you, he's looking right through you and you aren't even registering on his radar.\n\nI think sometimes people forget that \"fight mode\" is completely instinctual just like \"flight mode\".  Jumping in between 2 people in fight mode can get you seriously hurt.",

I would always compliment her on her progress, and we would play fight as you talked about as well. Months of this went by. She was getting in better shape than she had ever been. Stronger than ever. One night we were heading back from a bar and walking back up to our apartment. She was punching me in the arm, and after a few hits to the same spot, it hurts. I asked her to stop. She said something like, \"I could kick your ass if I want.\" I told her that we would never find out because I wouldn't want to hurt her. \n\nShe pressed it and tried pushing me and provoking, still playing, but being very rough. I just grabbed her wrist and put her arm behind her back without much effort and she instantly deflated. She was very hurt at the rude awakening. We have had long talks since. It basically boiled down to how she understands a little more about why I get worried sometimes when she is out late alone or going to a rough neighborhood. That not all men are cool. It was a really sad talk to have. We didn't fight over anything. She just didn't realize the strength difference between her and myself. \n\nI have gotten really out of shape compared to when we first met and she didn't realize that I didn't really get much weaker, I just can't do as many reps of lifting or whatever as I used to when I was ripped. I am starting to come into that old man strength where you can lift really heavy stuff, but only like once and then you need to rest your back for a few days.",

This year she had messed up her foot, and was wearing a \"boot.\" After I cut the tree down, I grabbed one of the lowest branches and start hauling it all by myself. After about 50 feet, I realized that she wasn't nearby. I looked, and found her staring at me with a look of confusion on her face. I explained that the whole Christmas tree thing was her thing, not mine, and I thought she enjoyed \"helping.\" After a brief back and forth (we were still in the middle of the Christmas tree farm), she asked me how strong I actually was. I told her that I honestly didn't know. I ended up dragging a 10 foot blue spruce tree all the way back to the shake and wrap station while giving her a piggyback ride as well.

For men, it starts at 5x for the lightest classes and goes down to around 3x for super heavy weight. For women it starts at 4 but still goes down to around 3. \n\nCertainly for any specific shared weight class other than super heavyweight, the numbers are not close. For the 148-lb weight class, for example, the men's world record is 4.74 x body weight while the women's is 3.75. For 198 it's 4.35 vs 3.16.",

It's entirely possible that she transitioned for the same reason as just about everyone who does (to stop feeling gender dysmorphia), and then didn't want to give up her career as an athlete. You can absolutely complain about her choosing to keep fighting despite her biological advantage, or the people who allowed it, but it is absolutely more damaging to trans people to accuse someone of lying about their reasons for transitioning (without proof).",

It's your position they transitioned to win some money and (maybe, depending on how you decide because you were inconsistent in your post) awards. It's my position that the two are independent. They decided to transition and also decided to compete.\n\nBecause transitioning is neither easy nor cheap nor stress free and it's a hell of a thing to put yourself through for some money and awards. If someone offered you $10M to become a woman would you do it? I wouldn't.",

She was 5 or 6 years after transition and hormone therapy.\n\nWe discussed her. Prior to the Olympics, she collected something like *12* gold medals, winning 1st place in basically every event she entered, for several years in a row. She then had (what would normally be) a career ending elbow injury, before returning to the sport.\n\nIn the other thread, I said I thought she might have been sandbagging because she was worried about having her titles stripped like Mary Gregory, but looking at her records in closer detail, idk what was really going on. Her actual weight numbers didn't really go down at all after her return, but all her placements did, so perhaps the competition got stiffer somehow, but she couldn't keep up, as a result of age and injury and possibly her hormone treatments starting to catch up to her a bit? I'm not sure, I don't know enough about competitive weightlifting as a sport to make an informed judgement.\n\n\n\nMy personal opinion? If she had never transitioned, she would have been a mediocre athlete, and probably never become an international title holder, and almost certainly never been a serious contender for a gold medal. It smacks of unjust enrichment and unfair competition for her to benefit from her transition the way she clearly did. She left the sport for like a decade, probably not expecting her career to really go anywhere at that point, then came back after transitioning, probably pretty much as early as she possibly could (have to get under the testosterone threshold), and *immediately* starts wracking up titles like crazy.\n\n\nI dunno man, maybe I'm just a cynic, but the whole thing stinks to me. Maybe I'm misjudging her, and being unfair, but I genuinely believe that she should never have competed in those events the way she did.",

Most men can physically dominate women but I'm gonna make the assumption is OP looks weaker than average and his ex was stronger than average. There are girls who are really into scrawny guys just as there are girls into muscular guys, so she probably liked the idea of being pretty strong next to him. Hence she naively believed it. Once the illusion was shattered, so did her attraction to him. \n\nObviously these are all giant leaps of assumptions lol. For all we know she broke up for a different reason.",

He didn't do what she wanted and even seemed to be mocking her. Instead of laughing it off or it having been silly she got angry and tried to prove to herself she could dominant him physically. It's creepy behaviour, play fighting is something loads of people do, you do it as kids with friends, you can do it with your girlfriend or wife. If one person doesn't actually get it's play fighting and think they are just physically dominating you, it's not a game and unless you are into that and want it, it's just the other person being abusive.",

No, but it's at least understandable given how scared that it can make someone to have their sense of safety shaken. That's something that can be dealt with by both sides communicating, talking it out, and apologizing if necessary. Like literally the whole point of having an SO is so that you can share these fears and thoughts with each other and support each other through them. Instead, while his SO is probably hurt and scared, OP busted out:\n\n>I tried to take the conversation seriously, but come on, how the fuck am I supposed to take this seriously. So I may have been somewhat mocking, flirting, and generally being an arse about the whole thing.\n\nSo she broke up with him for being an asshole and mocking her fears about her safety.\n\nIt just seems like an absolutely wild leap to jump from one single incident of OPs ex not realizing he was genuinely done with play-fighting instead of just continuing to play act (something he said they did all the time), to thinking that the only reason that she was in the relationship was to physically dominate someone and that once she couldn't, she broke up with him.",

I'm a bit of a germaphobe and that's a no-no.  So I pinned both of her wrists and held her for a few seconds when she tried to lift my arm back to her mouth to do it again.  Not enough to hurt her, but firm enough where she couldn't lift her arms or move. \n\nI saw instant fear spread across her face, she'd always believed she would hold her own when it mattered, but she was up shook for a couple hours realizing that was false (aside me, profusely apologizing). She calmed down after that and wanted to test me again.  So she didn't hold it against me at all, unlike OP.\n\nEdit: it was honestly good for her to be grounded in that way, I went through some basic self defense with her and enrolled her in martial arts (her choice).",

I think because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never had to think about. I have a very non-threatening presence.\n\nSo. Speaking only for myself, no, I don\u2019t need my partner to hide or avoid his strength. Speaking frankly, I find his strength sexy. It caught me unaware that one time, and it scared me because of previous experiences. But that\u2019s not on him. He isn\u2019t responsible for the terrible things other people did to me. He\u2019s a wonderful, gentle, kind, man, and he was horrified that he scared me. We\u2019ve known each other for a very long time, and have developed trust over the years. Time and communication are key to trust, especially when dealing with someone that\u2019s experienced trauma.\n\nIf you are kind and loving and gentle (you can be both strong and gentle), and have the sort of relationship where the other person can say \u201chey, you\u2019re scaring me\u201d and you can ease up and give them room to articulate their emotions into words without making them feel like they have to make you feel comfortable \u2026 well. That\u2019s the place my partner and I are at. If you are those things, I think you have little to worry about. That you\u2019re concerned and asking this question leads me to believe you are those things.\n\nIf you enjoy fantasy books, there\u2019s a character you might enjoy. Perrin Aybara, from The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan. His entire arc is about being a large, powerful man capable of violence and being terrified of unintentionally hurting someone.",

              "text": "It's also not just height and weight. My lovely wife is so much bigger than me. I'm pretty short 5.8 with a middle aged paunch and I have ever never been strong or muscly. My wife is 6ft easy and in soft focus and good light probably looks athletic. Dwarfs me in bare feet. She is also has kind of snoo snoo legs (but tiny arms like a T-Rex ). Her size and leg power make her a general asset for shifting shit about the house. Like I wouldn't hesitate to ask her to help me shift a wardrobe or something. And generally I can rely on her to try and help carry something really heavy. She could easily give me a piggy back. \n\nBut the difference in strength between my tiny puny male body and her tall strong female body is still immense. Because she is strong she will often not do the usual 'I need a strong man to help me' routine. She also thinks in general because she does more exercise and pilates she could probably take me. Which makes it even more glaringly obvious when it happens. The looks of 'I can't believe you have just moved that' after she has been trying and failing to shift stuff without help. Or the stuff she is convinced we will need to get some more help to do because she can't budge. We had some railway sleepers delivered for the garden that she couldn't move an inch and went off to get changed to help me while I moved them on my own.\n\nWe have wrestled in the past but don't tend to. Because she is so ass big the effort to restrain her would require a completely unacceptable level of force. I couldn't just casually tame her, it would require ugly brute force which would be shaming for all. \n\nAs an aside it's why in films I like to see action star women vaguely look like they might be able to break your face. Otherwise it just requires such suspension of disbelief.\n\nThis whole thread has made me think of my own kids. My young beast of a daughter has inherited her mothers size and thighs while my boy is going to be small like me. He has 3 years on her but she already weighs more and is the same height. They love to fight all the time. But even now he let's her win all the time for fun. She fights for real but he fights for the giggles. She probably is convinced she is the strongest (probably doesn't help that she must be the biggest kid in her class).",

Especially young women in their teens and twenties,  from my experience.   So much of society has been pushing that we are all equal so young people will tend to believe that and top it off by having such sheltered lives as many do, it's understandable.   I (male) had a particular friend (female) that thought this too.  She was pretty fit and strong given her build and had never pitted herself against a guy who wasn't playful or kind.  One day a bunch of us were all hanging out and she had been making some kind of comments about being able to rough me up.  My girlfriend at the time realized she actually thought she could.  Everyone else just thought she was joking around , like always.  And to be fair she was joking that she would hurt me, but we thought she was joking that she could.  My girlfriend asked about it she admitted that she could cause she was in shape and I'm,   well not.  So along with some good spirited teasing that , luckily taken pretty well, she 'tested' herself against me.  She tried to move arm without me giving in, and couldn't even with both arm and putting her body behind it. The one that stood out the most was when I let her actually punch me.  I tightened up stomach and she had hurt her hand.  It didn't feel good but it didn't hurt either.  Until she exclaimed how hard my stomach was and that she thought it was always soft and squishy.  I was wrong she could hurt me.  She legit thought I was like the Pillsbury Dough Boy all the way through.  Thats just hurtful.",

Or maybe they were interested in powerlifting (or similar) and they knew exactly what they were doing. With a bit of planning, research, etc. you can build whatever type of body you want at the gym.\n\nThis is just a personal anecdote, but I was a residential carpenter for a few years. I was in good shape while I was working that job, but I was in better shape (and much stronger) when I was a college student who went to the gym regularly.",

All that yard work (digging holes, swinging pick mattocks, carrying logs and sleepers, cement bags, wheel barrows) taught me how to use my whole body when I was young. \n\nI also played basketball with people that were 6ft when I barely scratched 5ft. My dad made me work when he taught me to play basketball as a little kid. So I'm fast, jump high (can touch the backboard) and put up a decent fight against bigger guys. But technique played a huge part in that. \n\nSmaller guys can definitely learn to use their bodies better and appear stronger. Look at Manny Pacquiao.",

You are just constantly using muscles you don't normally use while in awkward positions. Lots of repetitive stress injuries, lots of aches and pain, but you end up with chords for muscles. A good example is a day of unloading christmas trees off an 18 wheeler, they are all packed in on their sides, wrapped in netting, wedged in tight. You gotta really pull to get the first few out, then climb on top to get the ones that aren't wedged. Then once you have a bunch out, get down and walk 'em to wherever the people want them. Usually packed with snow on them so extra heavy. Or painting. Carry these 12 5-gallon paint buckets up these 6 flights for this new construction and get to work. Or move this 36 foot extension ladder, while extended, around to a different part of a building. The leg, core, back, and arm work out keeping the thing stable while you dodge windows to paint the next length of soffit/trim so you can climb it 100 times a day with a paint bucket in one hand is insane. Then move your arms like Mr. Miyagi taught you a thousand time while holding yourself up 36 feet in the air with just the tension in your calves, and while your up there, scrape that old paint off the wall.

She used to do it with her dad as a little girl, and no one wanted to go with her to do it as an adult. I'm in construction, and drive a truck. I'm used to much harder work than cutting down a tree, and I've hauled worse things than a tree in my truck. \n\nThe first year we lived together, she mentioned it. She said it was something that basically made her Christmas every year when she was younger, so I said that I'd be willing to go, and help, if she wanted. Well, OF COURSE she wanted!

Then you turn idk 10 or 11, and everything with boys becomes awkward, and you stop doing that. You go through puberty and so do they. When you're 15,16 you get a boyfriend, and you're still quite rowdy and playful, and you play fight and in your mind nothing really has changed from when you were in elementary school. In all aspects, you think of him as am equal. \n\nAnd then one day, you find out their real strength. And you find out that person that you felt safe around, because you thought you were on equal footing, both equally able to control the situation could control, harm or murder you without great physical struggle. There's no logical reasoning why he would, but he could and there's nothing you can do. And that sudden loss of (perceived) control was quite jarring for me too, and it took a while to deal with that. \n\nIt's like if someone told you tomorrow the dog you had for years is actually venomous, and if it bites you, you die. You have a good relationship with your dog, he has never bitten you. He sometimes playfully nibbles on your finger. But he could easily bite, there's nothing you can do.

Like during a massage or something, I immediately have to stop when the other persons makes any painful sounds. I'd be a terrible doctor, I don't think I could physically bring myself to cut into a person even if it would safe their life, lol. \n\nMy husband thinks that's bad in case I have to defend myself one day (and maybe also because of the lackluster massages). So when we playfight, he always eggs me on to put more strength into it. One time, many years back, we were walking next to each other and I started doing that thing where you punch the person next to you lightly in he shoulder and they punch back a bit stronger and it escalates back and forth. But of course it never really escalates with me, because I just can't do more after a certain point. As usual my husband was trying to convince me to *really* try, I say I just can't, he says you just have to, and eventually I said, okay, well, I'll punch you as hard as I can, but only if you punch me as hard as you can afterwards. That way we're even. Maybe that'll work. There was a moment of hesitation in his eyes, but he agreed.\n\nSo I get into the stance, I rile myself up, come on, trodat, you can do that, channel the beast etc. My husband presents me his shoulder, cheering me on, come on, trodat, I'm asking for it, put me to the ground! I take aaaalll my mental strength, don't flich, don't pull back, just do it, do it - and I punch him and his shoulder cracks and he yelps and even sways a bit. We both can't believe it. I did not put him to the ground, but he says, wow, that really hurt and I'm like, what do you mean \"wow\", of course it hurt, I could kill you with one hand, you're lucky I'm usualy holding back, and the next minute is spend with me swaggering around flexing. But then I start to feel bad again and I tell him now it's his turn. We don't have to do that, he says, you're good, I understand now I'm married to Red Sonja. But no, that wasn't the deal. Don't patronise me. No holding back. So we get into position again, now with him aiming for my shoulder. No holding back, I remind him. All you got. And then I guess I was hit by a bus or something. All I remember is all my bones at once making an awful crunchy sound, my collarbones shaking hands and then I go flying into a hedge and then I'm on the ground crylaughing. My arm didn't even hurt for half an hour or so, it was just completely numb. I think my left shoulder is now forever a bit shorter than my right one. \n\nMy husband is definitely not \"average\" when it comes to strengths, but I still do cry a bit on the inside when I think about the enormous gap between what I can do when I do my very best and even channel some real anger, and what he can do just by sheer muscle strengths, without any emotion behind it. Also how he can exert that power without much effort, and how much my psyche is holding me back all the time. The body and it's differences are a real thing, but so is socalisation.",

Maybe I was just a bit of a wuss but when I did karate years ago as a teenager I got frustrated by how hard I was being hit by a couple of specific sparring partners. Primarily a girl (personal suspicion: they don't learn to hold back the same way guys do so take it too far sometimes), but also I now remember a really big bloke too. Considering they both hit me about the same, I'd wager the guy was making more effort to hold back than the girl was.",

I'd laugh it off and tell her I could take some hits from her skinny arms.  So she started hitting harder and more frequently.  Around that time, I started learning Muay Thai as a hobby, so when she started getting punchy, I knew how to deflect the strikes.  This just frustrated her more, and she'd keep punching and punching.  Finally, I didn't just block a punch, I caught her in a wrist lock and stopped her cold.  \"OK,\" I said, \"This used to be cute, but you're taking it too far. I don't want either of us to get hurt, so let's agree that it ends now.\"\n\nShe agreed and fumed about it for a few days, but she stopped hitting me.  I don't think she ever forgave me for sticking up for myself, though, which should have been a sign.",

If girls are fortunate enough to never suffer abuse then they\u2019re only real gauge is the kinda fighting kids do when boys and girls are the same strength.

About how she would always beat my buddy in wrestling.  How it was never even close. I figured he was letting her win, but didn\u2019t wanna out him for it. She did lift a lot of weights and was big, plus she came from a rough childhood so had a lot of pride in mental and physical toughness.\n\nOne day (early pandemic, we all lived together and had nothing better to do than get wasted at nights) we were all drunk and talking.  She started poking fun at all of us and saying she could kick our asses.  I let it go on for a while but she wouldn\u2019t drop it. She was challenging me to wrestle.\n\nI accepted and tackled and pinned her within about 2 seconds.  She blamed it on poor reaction and said she wasn\u2019t ready.  Ok, we go again. Immediately pinned her again.  She still said it was unfair.  I let her start out literally sitting on top of my back. Easily flipped and pinned immediately. \n\nShe starts laughing and saying that I\u2019m much stronger than my buddy.  I said \u201cno, he probably goes easy on you\u201d. She looked like I slapped her and asked him if it was true. He fessed up and she asked to wrestle him.  He immediately pinned her too. She went to their room and cried for an hour (drunk and her pride was hurt.) her BF understandably blamed me and it definitely killed the mood for the night lol.  Took her down a couple pegs.

I was a long distance runner and was playfully picked on by my roommates and friends about how skinny and weak my arms were. At some point his gf started joking that she was stronger than me which my roommate egged on and encouraged until she started to believe it. She challenged me to a bicep curl contest and wouldnt take no for an answer.\n\nShe starts out by grabbing a 20lb and doing 10 reps and was clearly struggling by the end. I grabbed the 30 lbs cranked out 15 reps no problem and walked away. And wouldnt you know it, suddenly everyone is uncomfortable and unhappy just like I told them\n\nEdit: realized I misremembered the weights and changed it to 20 and 30 lbs rather than 25 and 35 lbs",

I sprinted my 100ft or whatever, and then waited for her to sprint. I started laughing, I was in hysterics, I thought she was joking, she literally looked like she was running in slow motion. Thing is she had never pushed herself to get faster, she just had really good stamina from her morning runs, it wasn't until much later that she was able to properly push her legs, and actually look like she was sprinting.",

He would trick me and lock me into closets or one time a rabbit cage (it was a dare lol), try to hold me under water, etc. And when I got out I would beat the ever loving shit out of him because it scared me so bad. At the time we were like 5 to 8 years old and he was tiny because he hadn't hit puberty yet so yeah I could kick his ass. \n\nA few years pass and we don't hang out as much, we're probably around 11 years old. At my grandma's he's hogging the computer and won't let me play when it's my turn. We start to get into a fight but our youngest cousin, like a 2 year old, wanders in and I pick him up trying to make sure he doesn't get hurt. So neither of us are trying to throw punches but we're kind of pushing each other and he is way crazy stronger than he used to be.\n\n Knowing that he's holding back because of the baby I'm holding freaks me out even more. I definitely took pride in my strength (I was one of the strongest girls in my grade at the time) and ability to whip his ass when he deserved it so it was a huge blow to my ego. Plus you lose this feeling of control and the idea that you can protect yourself if you need to. After the fight I ran to the bathroom and cried. It really felt like my world view was shattered a bit. I grew up around some abusive family members so having the illusion of power and control taken from me once again was pretty devastating. And I never physically fought my cousin again haha",

They were on the ground in a hot second, after being punched in the face (a couple times mebbe?), and dude took off on foot.\n\nIt was on the local news, the whole thing was on cellphone videos and the guy later turned himself in and he wasn't charged with a felony or anything serious cuz he was attacked first and he didn't punch them when they were down.  I prolly have some of the factoids wrong, but that's about the gist of it.  \n\nThose gals would have been better served with a more realistic understanding of biology.  Then they wouldn't have been sitting on the ground with looks of stunned disbelief, mouths agape, and maybe bleeding a little, needing PTSD treatment afterwards.\n\nDowntown LA is like the homeless capitol of the USA.

Because the vast majority of men will be stronger than me.\n\nYeah, a 13 yo or an elderly person is going to probably lose in both strength and speed on average to me, whereas they would both be stronger than most women, but the point is you cannot readily change that, so you need to take precautions accordingly.\n\nI've become so much stronger and faster, as i compete at a high level in sports, and most men my age, who've been sitting on their couch for years, are all significantly stronger. \n\nI also have a bleeding disorder, so literally could die from such an attack, rather easily.\n\nIt sucks, but you've got to accept the hand you've been dealt with and move forward.

          "text": "Surprising how low this is from the top. \n\nMy brother just got out of a relationship that started as play fighting (they're both MMA fighters, so at first it was just \"cute\" to him). It progressed to him realizing she really seemed to be wanting to win those fights, always starting them, always ending them, always being the one who takes it a bit too far and apologizes later. And then it escalated to outright physical abuse (she slapped him for startling her after he dropped a pair of scissors 3 ft from her). He admitted to me that if I hadn't been there at that moment, she probably could have found some way to rationalize it in his mind (it's my bad, I should've been more careful), minimize it (well she's tiny so what's the harm?) or at least make him feel like it was something she was \"working on.\"\n\nHe could ABSOLUTELY kick her ass if it was blind rage against blind rage. The thing is, it's not. It's an unfair fight because she's willing to physically injure my brother and she is 100% aware he'd never intentionally hurt her.\n\nPlay fighting *can* be normal, and healthy, but there are red flags that one partner is using it to test boundaries of control. I'm not one to slam the, \"Relationship didn't work out? One of them must be an abuser!\" button, but a lot of abusers purposely push boundaries during play-fighting or play off physical abuse as \"just joking.\"",

She arrived with two medium sized suitcases, probably planning to move out in waves, but I wasn't going to let her drag it out, keep her foot in the door and make it harder on my brother. No excuses to come back.\n\nShe told him she's pregnant the next day, then two days later said she went to the doc and they told her she had a miscarriage, then two days after that said she actually didn't miscarry and was actually just lying to not make him feel obligated to help, then two days after that said she had an abortion. I think that was enough of a pile of red flags that he's confident: (A.) she's lying about all of it (B.) he really dodged a fuckin bullet.\n\nNow they're no-contact and he's having fun with the freedoms he didn't realize she had slowly closed him off from over the years: friends, family, his career, and his hobbies. Trauma is trauma and that takes time to unlearn and unpack, but I think so far it's a happy ending in progress, and I couldn't be more proud of him.",

My buddy looks at me and I nod my head sideways a few times and shrug, gesturing my hands at her while she's sitting there Hulk Hogan flexing, tightening her stomach.\n\nSo he punches her square in the abs with what was clearly a wimpy shot, and it completely folds her up, dropping her to the floor.

You will not get out unscathed, But you can get out, just as others have managed to get out.

Point in case, Gadot recently had a wonderful part in Red Notice.  But like *every* other role, they should be able to sell the role.  Watching someone like Rousey or Carano fuck people up is far easier to enjoy.",

If your only experience is with the black belts at McDojos, I can understand why you would feel this way. At least with kajukenbo, the view is that if you can land a good hit on a black belt, they deserved it. You're probably right that it would've been a very short fight if I could get my hands on her, but I'm equally certain that I never would have except by sheer luck.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Weight classes exist for a very good reason\n\nIt's true! But it definitely matters more for groundwork than striking arts. I'm not saying weight is irrelevant if you're standing up, only that it matters *less*.",

Fast forward a few years and I overheard her talking at a party about how she doesn't need to worry, because if she gets attacked or whatever she has had practice and is confident she can defend herself. I had to pull her aside and make sure she wasn't talking about me. She thinks Im Messing around and try to beat me up again, but I just don't play along. I watched the confidence drain from her eyes and it's still one of my least favorite memories. I'm happy she know her real limitations, but she legit thought she was strong as hell for years and she lost it all in a moment.",

There is nothing dumb about her behavior in this story, a lot of people don't really have a perspective of how much strenght is common, it is completely reasonable for an athletic woman to expect to be stronger than her not so athletic partner if she hasn't experienced how strong men naturally are before.\nThis being a hurtful revelation was just a misunderstanding and could have been cleared up as one, but OP pretty mocked her for ever thinking a woman could be as strong as him when they talked about it.\nThat was insensitive.\n\nOp isn't some evil anti feminist for doing this, he was just a bit emotionally dumb. He is at least somewhat capable of learning from his mistake, and perhaps now understands relationships a bit better. His fuck up was being mean and dismissive, not that he showed strenght. Trust is delicate, and shaming someone for trusting you is a great way for them to stop doing so.\n\nYou on the other hand, continue to dismiss the possibility of someone's feelings being valid just because the situation that arose them is silly. Well sorry for you I guess, but people have strong feelings about silly things. That is not called being dumb, it is completely normal. We have emotional attachment to things; we like souveneirs from trips, we get emotional at fictional stories about people who don't exist, we like to keep trophies of our achievements and we hold perceptions of the world that are based on our own experiences to be true regardless of collective experiences.\n\nFailling to recognize when someone you love is in a vulnerable spot can happen, we aren't mind readers, but we should aim to be better over time, not justify ourselves by creating ridiculous conjecture about people we don't know on the internet.",

In that case, you are completely correct, not being taken seriously and getting laughed at is precisely the worst reaction as it solidifies that you can't trust this person...

Like the first time a guy just continued with me and I tried my hardest to fight and stop (all in play!), it was like a major emotional drop for me. \n\nAs women we\u2019re always told to be careful, but when you feel the full difference between the strength of men and women, it\u2019s legit terrifying. As this was definitely her first time experiencing it, it sounds like she feels like the rug is pulled out from under her. \n\nShe\u2019s probably trying to figure out why it upset her so much, and settled on the lying angle. It\u2019s not true - he thought she knew. But she just doesn\u2019t know why she\u2019s so upset and is projecting the fear/anger onto him.",

              "text": "I actually had an experience like this with my (now) wife. When we were dating, we used to play wrestle a lot. She was super athletic, tennis, track and actually quite strong, so she typically thought the difference between men and women was mostly due to most women not doing things like strength training. \n\nNow, when we wrestled, I always 'lost'--always let her pin me, because of course I loved her pinning me hah. She used to like to tease me that she could beat me at my own game if she wanted to wrestle (I wrestled in school). It was a lot of fun. One day though, I was waiting for a really important call from work--she didn't know this and she had me pinned and wouldn't let me up, teasing me I was going to miss the call.\n\nI told her I can't play right now and was able to lift her up while sitting up myself, and place her beside me before going to get the phone--was all very gentle, which I think made even more an impression because I didn't struggle or strain to shift her around. She got this look on her face that I didn't notice until I sat back down with her, like she was genuinely nervous. She later confided in me that I made her feel like a child, like she didn't realize I could just lift her up like it was nothing while she was using all her weight to try and force me down. Was an odd experience. I could tell she was a little more hesitant around me for a while, which sucked. =-/ I felt like an ogre. But she eventually told me she ended up enjoying it, because it made her realize how gentle I am with her. Its nice, but I'll never forget that look on her face.",

My leg and core strength was ridiculous. \nI used to hit the gym in the wintwrs a lot just to stay in decent shape. This was when I was about halfway through my first few month of the year and was doing 60s on flys. A Farmville came in. Could not have weighed more than 120 pounds. He grabbed 2 90 or 95 pound dumbbells and started doing flys with em like they were paper weights. It was really inspiring and inside of another month I was up to 90s. \nThe burly farm boys have ridiculous strength. One that was a buddy of mine was benching over 425 pounds as a highschooler. Ridiculous. \nThey can take an ass beating too. Tough as nails. Never underestimate a farm boy's strength.",

It's how we do it here. \nWhen I moved to Colorado and was working I always got paid well and busted my ass. Ended up running my own crew of up to 8 people a day on a huge development project. Started put sweeping. I loved working with central and South Americans there while racists talked shit about them, I didn't get it. They were amazing workers. Started learning Spanish and learned pretty quickly they like to talk shit. It was jawdroppi g when they found out I understood them. Gave them about a month to figure it out, as I was asked when I was taking lunch and I replied in a few sentences of Spanish. They never talked shit about me being a white boy again. Loved working with Texans too. Even if theybwere fucked up on pills. Couldn't tell and they worked their asses off. Worked production lines with central and south Americans too. The ladies loved me cause I could keep up. They were so awesome to work with. They would bring in homemade food and it was better than any restaurant. I've worked hard labor with people from all over. Worked with a lot of transients. They are hit and miss. The best ones just have had a tough break usually. But I always felt terrible for the heroin addicts. and sketchy with the meth heads. The meyh heads would steal if they wanted and just ditch the job sites. Anyway I'm rambling on about shit most people probably don't wanna hear. Sorry for novella.",

The triceps are stronger and the motions have a better mechanical advantage throughout the workout.\n\nUnless you're doing them both horribly wrong, in which case it's only a matter of time before you hurt yourself.\n\nNow... Lawnmower pulls? Sure. Plenty of teenagers can work up to 100 PER ARM in that, over the course of a school year. I, a 125lb (at the time) dude, had that down in about 3 months of weight training, in high school. Curling 100? Yeah no.

Or taking a free weight barbell off the barbell rack at your gym that is labeled 100lbs on the sides?\n\nThe average man is not doing either of those. I rarely see guys working up over 70-80ish on barbell curls. The ones that do for the most part look fairly built.",

I prefer curling with the bar and 2 tens on either side to actually get more reps in and more focus on the bicep rather than forearm. I'm not super built by any means (5'9\" and 180 lbs, I think that's fairly average) and definitely get more benefit from 80 lbs, but I can rep 100 no problem so I would assume most guys could at least get one curl in, even if it's anchoring their elbows into their hips or something. Idk how this became an exercise conversation but I'm all for it and it reminded me I need to work out today haha",

You can try jutting your hip way far out, doing the gay tapping foot stance, but that doesn't really give you much and it'll strain lots of things that aren't meant to take stress.",

Like i can easily move furniture that any 2 of them would be struggling to move, what\u2019s up with that?\n\nThen one day I realised that they weren\u2019t actually holding the kids in their arms but just supporting it while they actually rested the kid on their hips. The kids entire weight was going straight down their leg underneath. The little side-lean I\u2019d assumed was them adjusting their centre of gravity was actually them sticking the hip out fractionally further to help with this.",

You're right, the moment a girl or woman is truly confronted with the extent of her physical vulnerability to half of the humans she shares the earth with fucking sucks. It's *terrifying*. But not every woman has that moment, or of they do it isn't until adulthood because men, in general, are so good at not throwing it in their faces outside of assaults. I'm not sure if it's an instinct or learned from play fighting other boys (getting your ass kicked by older boys past puberty and then becoming the older stronger one able to kick ass), I assume both. The point is, mature men temper their strength and they do it so well that many women don't ever realize they're doing it. \n\nMy son is an only child and has 2 moms. I play fight with him as much as I can and will encourage him to do so with his peers once he's stronger than me. This developmental process is so important and this thread is a good demonstration why!",

They learn that competition and domination can be fun and healthy - of you stick to the rules. And they learn how much strength is acceptable in society: If you make someone cry or uncomfortable, the play stops.\nFor ourselves, as boys we have this innate desire to go to the limit of our capabilities and playfighting is a safe way of testing these limits and learning control over your body.\n\nIt also involves a large amount of touching and all boys need to feel touch from their parents or peers if they should become healthy adults. \nAll in all its just such an important part in male development. So, it's always nice to see people taking their job as a parent so seriously and taking their kids needs into account. \u2764\ufe0f",

Testing the limits of one's strength and pain, practicing consensual physical exchanges, and learning to express and read body language clues. I think science calls it rough-and-tumble play which is probably a better term because it doesn't, and shouldn't, always take the form of pretend aggression. \n\nI only have 1 child but grew up babysitting 40 younger cousins and always followed kids' leads in this area because individual interest in this kind of play varies a lot, even within genders. I hated it growing up, and got all related physical development through sport. My own brother never really engaged in it at all. He never found an outlet he was comfortable with. He's a well rounded adult but annoyingly competitive in games and a sore loser. No way to know if it's related but it's fascinating to speculate.",

If a course has junior tees normally they are halfway down the fairway, as they are for true juniors.

Similarly, it\u2019s potentially embarrassing for someone who has gotten too old for the whites and has to move up a tee because we have arbitrarily labeled the red tees as \u201cladies\u201d.

She blew me away in physique, determination, dedication, and all around motivation. I greatly admired her for it. Just the dedication she showed was phenomenal, as well as it being really cool finding my first experience with someone that understood my love of athletics.\n\nShe LOVED to wrestle. And let\u2019s be real, as an early 20-something, I loved wrestling with her. I used to ALWAYS let her pin me and I always enjoyed every second of it\n\nAt one of my family gatherings, my brothers (there are 6 of us brothers in all) and I all broke out in what was basically a huge wrestle-fest. After it was over she pulled me to the side and asked if I had been letting her win the whole time. Because after watching us, she couldn\u2019t understand how she would always pin me. I smiled and said \u201cof course I have, one because I genuinely enjoy it and two because I\u2019d never do anything to hurt you.\u201d She said that it knocked her ego down for a bit, because she never really understood the strength difference before. But she appreciated my being gentle with her\n\nWe sadly didn\u2019t make it for more than a few months after that, but we ended amicably and she\u2019s happily married to an outstanding guy now and I couldn\u2019t be happier for them!",

She kept trying to make me go full on, convinced herself and me that she could take it and hold her own against me, at the time, a scrawny 16 year old. Like the idiotic teenager that I was I eventually agreed. It took about 25 seconds before I\u2019d accidentally bruised 7 of her ribs. Since then I\u2019ve always held back **a lot**, even with guys.

She was joking, but I thought it would be funny to see her try. I said, \"I don't think that will work, but you can try.\" She smirked and tried, full force, completely ineffectively to remove me from her spot. Her reaction was similarly shocked, visibly processing and also embarrassed. Tbh, that's also when I learned how different in strength our genders had become by 17 years old.",

Furthermore even if a woman was more fit than a guy physics says the force of her weight due to gravity isn't affected by strength. Maybe she could pin you against a wall but not to the floor.",

She was an only child from a single mom (no brothers and a often absent father), wasn't an athlete (no comparable experience), and I was her first ltr.  She was maybe 130, I was 6' 200 and a moderately active slacker (swim, bike, run almost every day).  \n\n\nEarly in our relationship we were fooling around and I teasingly tossed her onto the bed (for sexy times) and that brought her up short (sexy time over).  She suddenly got real-real serious.  Asked me how I did that, could I just pick stuff up whenever?  I jokingly asked how she thought my broke-ass got a couch up to  a 4 story walk-up efficiency?   She said she thought I was joking when I said I carried it up by myself.  \n\n\nShe was quiet for a bit, then asked if I could pick her up.  So I did, over my head.  She was fascinated.   I did some playful overhead presses with her (I could only do a few) and some other showing off, she was surprised but was also excited (resume sexy times).  \n\n\nOver the next few weeks she would ask me to pick stuff up, or move things.  It took me a while (once she started asking me to move really heavy shit) that I realized she was trying to figure out exactly how strong I was and how that translated to the other men out there.  We eventually talked about it and I explained I was just a little stronger than average but I was also young and healthy and most guys can do the things I could.  I think it was a real paradigm shift for her, and me.  I'll never forget her face when I yeeted her lol",

I always took it, she wasn\u2019t my type or anything and it was a bit annoying at times but whatever. \n\nThen when wrestling season started I see her show up and eventually we got to wrestle eachother since we were the same weight. The only thing I remember is how small she looked all of a sudden standing there in front of me as my opponent compared to the bigger guys that I would wrestle and how fast she crumbled when I moved on her. It was completely a waste of time to wrestle her. She was so weak and squishy. She told me that I was really strong and was surprised about it and stopped being physical in classes. She also quit wrestling later on.",

Just something I expected to do.  \n  \nAlthough, one tournament I got up to 178 by end of day 1. Had to be 161 next morning. Coach asked what I was over, no way in hell am I telling him 17 pounds. I was pretty damn good at shedding off the weight, but even for me that seemed a bit much, and coach was always stressed out. I\u2019m not adding to his stress unnecessarily. So I just lied and told him a very reasonable (to me) \u201cjust 9 pounds no problem\u201d. He freaked out and I reminded him I\u2019ve never missed weight.  \n  \nSeveral hours later, he comes to check on us. We all weigh in. I\u2019m 6-7 pounds over or so. I\u2019m thinking sweet! I just lost a good amount, he\u2019ll be proud of me. I totally forgot I told him I was 9 pounds over. \u201cYou\u2019ve only lost 2 pounds all this time!! What\u2019ve you been doing?!?!!\u201d  \n  \nI lost another few pounds that night, floated 2 more sleeping, weighed in at 161.0, and won the tournament.  \n  \nThat same tournament, one of our guys missed weight on day, they allowed him to go up a weight class and wrestle in that one. Day 2 he missed weight for that one, too. Coach didn\u2019t give me much trouble on my weight after that.",

That seems a little low, but I'm not even lifting right now and I have as much muscle mass as nearly anyone below 6', according to this source. \n\nhttps://www.builtlean.com/how-much-muscle-can-you-gain-naturally/",

I find it interesting how big of an increase a couple inches makes on this first pass comparison. And yeah,  I should have almost 30 lbs of bone so I'm more realistically sitting at 160 lbs of muscle mass which makes more sense, since I am not 20 lbs of muscle away from having very large muscles.",

That's the category they are competing, and measuring cross categories is virtually impossible.  \n\nIn the end it's like asking who is the better sportsman - the best football player, the best heavyweight lifter, the best cyclist or the best climber.  \n\nSo anytime people make a claim in that way (ranking someone in a broader category than in which they actually compete), it can't be objective.  \nIt's okay to say it, but I will always take it more as a \"that person is reeeally good\" and not \"they are the best\".",

Of course, I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s impossible or that someone cannot. \nBut I\u2019d have to disagree, you certainly can split the two. But I can see that depending on location. In my other comment, I mentioned that when I lived in Hawaii, there was a large group of females who wrestled, but you have to start somewhere. I definitely feel like many were put off by the fact it was mixed in general, so that\u2019s another factor.",

He'd be gassed at the end of the round yet so would I.\n\nWith a different rule set, I'm confident he could have picked me up in my guard and then rip me apart with his bare hands. But that's against IBJJF rules, pretty sure against IJF rules as well.\n\nA saying I've heard before and think makes sense: Strength is a multiplier of technique. So someone weaker (with edge cases) with superior technique can have an advantage yet you give the stronger opponent 1-2 years of training they can start becoming a pain-in-the ass real quick.

If you close a door near the hinges it's harder than if you close it at the doorknob. Similarly, If you have a very poorly done ankle lock you can still break stuff if you're beastly strong, even if you're on the calf, but if you're actually at the ankle, fall correctly, have high arms, shrug, etc then you need much less effort to actually make someone tap",

Whether it's a woman thinking an athletic woman can take an athletic man or a man saying something like \"yeah he's big but I know kickboxing\", they just don't appreciate what 50 pounds of extra muscle does. Good luck kickboxing a guy who can bear hug you so hard you die of asphyxiation. Equality is great, equal opportunity is great, someone who is 50-100lbs larger than you will beat you down as if you were a toddler. Maybe 1 time in 100 a lucky punch lands and a fight goes the other way, but if someone has that much size on you it's not a fight. Bears don't 'fight' people, they pin them down and kill them. 300 pound men don't 'fight' smaller people. There's a reason the advice with grizzly bears is \"don't fight back\", you aren't fighting, you're struggling. \n\nHaving said that, some of the comments around mine were women talking about fear of men and fighting back during an assault. Absolutely fight back with everything you have. Don't try and win the fight or go strength against strength. Cause pain, fight to get free, fight to get away. Kick/punch vulnerable spots, break out of holds, and don't stop fighting to get up and away. You absolutely can put up a good fight and get away and hopefully not be pursued far. Having play fought women/gf's and my wife often for 10 years, it's easy to over power her and 'win a fight', it's exceptionally difficult to hold her in place, not let her get away. If we're play wrestling I can pin her easy, but even pinned if she kicks and fights I can't hold her down, and I've got 80 pounds on her.",

She was perhaps putting a bit to much weight behind her punches leading to a lack of control and her getting a fair few warnings in tournaments against other girls her age and size.\n\nOne day the trainer asked me to spar against her and \"don't hold back so much\". I am a lean guy, maybe half a foot taller and adult. I went from pulling my punches before connecting to applying my usual \"warm up\" effort. Maybe 50 % of how I would connect with my male sparring partners. My kicks and punches was painful and she thought I was being mean. So she started cursing and tried to punch me full force in the gut, which did hurt a bit but wasn't really enough to make me move or react.\n\nShe later admitted that she had no idea I was holding back that much. I then went to the sand bag to show her what my full force kicks would be like and she went real quiet, while I just felt embarrassed.\n\nI am by no means a strong big guy, but the strength of a teenage girl and a grown man is on entirely different levels and I'm glad she could learn that lesson in a controlled environment with friends.",

There was a pair of twins in particular that my instructor was trying so hard to get to think before swinging lol. He would have me just bounce around lightly tapping them while they tried their best, but they took a bit to learn awareness. I got them to run into each other a few times with attacks before they wised up. ( I am pretty short and would often have to be on my knees for some kids so he could emphasize how little movement you need to deflect and dodge. Honestly, we had a super talented and well behaved little girl who was a joy to spar. She would be so light on her feet and creative.)",

Everything else is an instant knockout.\n\nIt is a consequence of evolution, unlike other species, female humans never had to hunt for themselves or their offspring, it was always the men. So their bodies just aren't built for fighting.\n\nThis is also the reason why a manvsman fight can be a police case and a womanvswoman fight is usually just a trivial catfight that can be separated and forgot about. Put aside the physical attributes, women don't have the sheer aggressiveness that men have in a fight. So even in an equal match scenario they(usually) don't effectively hurt each other.",

We have demonstrated elevated diurnal secretion of LH and testosterone by athletes with PCOS than by those without (Fig. 2) (22). In contrast, in athletes with FHA due to energy deficiency, LH pulsatility is abolished and levels of testosterone are low (Fig. 2) (22). Thus, the hormonal profile associated with PCOS differs completely from that of FHA. At the same time, the level of testosterone in women with PCOS remains typically within the upper part of the normal range. The bodies of such athletes are more anabolic, with a greater amount of muscle mass and higher bone mineral density than other athletes (21).\n\nPersonal anecdote: my wife has always been great at sports, always trying to keep up with the guys and thinking most of the other girls are just not trying hard enough. Found out decades later that she has always had PCOS and we're paying a high price for it. At least she was able to benefit from its \"competitive advantages\" when she was younger.",

One armed (other holding my nose closed), I grabbed her, was able to out kick her to get up-leverage and just solidly dunked her because I wasn't wanting to deal with it at the time.\n\nThe sheer look of shock on her face, and later admitting to me that she realized that every single guy ever in life had been \"playing\" with her made her legit angry.  I asked her, so when women come up play fighting with us, we should just lay them out every time at 25% effort?  Or do we want non-abusive men?",

Ours has been in a 'Little Ninjas' class for years and watches all kinds of action cartoons (She-Ra, Voltron, etc) and so of course assumes she can fight! I am hoping when she is older to transition her into a real MA class to help for the inevitable minefield of adult life. But yeah, I also think that will help lessen the shock when it happens.",

I mean, for one she's using a sword and two, she one-inch punched out of a grave and it's generally a ridiculous kung fu movie so... Everything else is easy to put aside.\n\nI enjoyed the first Charlies Angel's movies because they were supposed to be silly but I haven't watched the reboot and yeah I probably draw the line at Queen Latifah as The Equalizer as it's supposed to be a realistic sort of gritty thing. \n\nI hadn't heard about this until just now and I don't understand why it needed to happen. I mean.. You've built an audience with a character.. If you have to change actors do a \"how he became the equalizer\" using a younger actor or something. When you change the character that much it's like you're making something that doesn't have an audience from something that does, or did.\n\nI thought they did a good job with Ruby Rose in John Wick 2 though - https://youtu.be/7-TZCEyok_o?t=98\n\nYou sort of go \"ehhhhh she's 5' nothing\" but you watch that and can see that she was exceptionally skilled and probably functioned mostly in the executive decisions to keep her boss safe, ie where to go, how to travel, directing other henchmen, but basically as soon as she fights John (with the advantage of a knife) he just picks her up and throws her around like a child and can't at all stop him just puncturing her at will.\n\n*edit* Literally in the middle of watching Red Notice right now several hours after this comment and had to pause Gal Gadot's hand to hand combat with The Rock to come here and.. well.. sigh.",

I'm not saying that women should never ever be shown to beat men in hand to hand combat. I think there are many TV shows and movies which show this in a believable way. For example, Atomic Blond shows Charlize Theron fighting several men but she is a trained operative and in the end she uses everything at her disposal as weapons (rather than just hand to hand) and she does not come away unscathed but injured.\n\nOr Gina Carano in Haywire. Again, she's a trained operative who looks physically imposing.\n\nSo yeah, if done in a more believable way, I'm more than willing to go with it in a show or movie. But the majority of the time it just looks silly.",

It's probably the shortest \"boss\" battle in the whole trilogy. And she doesn't really \"struggle\" against being stabbed like a man often would in a scene like that, he pauses for a moment (not her resisting) then just pushes the knife in.\n\nThe only bit I think is a bit dubious is the part where she backs him up against the wall which only makes sense in a \"he's backing up to dodge the knife thrusts\" not \"Ruby is physically pushing\".\n\nOverall John Wick has a mythology with larger than life almost comic book characters and surviving falling off buildings and what not so I contextualize her casting within that. As in, within universe it's not silly that she is head security, so long as she doesn't actually put up a (physical) fight against John.\n\nI was going to say sort of like Elijah Wood being a boss level villain in Sin City but I guess he's not that physical.\n\nI haven't seen Carano in Haywire, and knowing nothing about her I did kind of initially go \"here we go\" when I first saw her in The Mandolorian but I fully agree that I want women to be MMA fighters if they're going to be the muscle in a show (or a Gwendoline Christie Brianne/Phasma type as I never once didn't believe her in GOT). And Star Wars is essentially a show about magic anyways.",

It was very obviously NOT play, and we were surrounded by parents, kids, like literally dozens of people in a nice gated community, and not one of them did a damn thing. He ended up throwing me across the street (lost my grip on my pillowcase) and they jumped in a van and took off. They could have easily just grabbed me or one of my friends and thrown us into the van and nobody would have done anything.",

Sometimes a lady can be very clearly struggling, but this same lady can be in an abusive relationship with an asshole that'll just finish you and convince her to put the blame on you, it happens every so often.\n\nAnd also, you can't blame people for not putting others' above themselves, specially when most people don't.

I ended up bloody and bruised in the middle of the street after they drove off. \n\nBut you are right, people are selfish and wont step in, and I cant expect them to. Im sure they have their reasons. But our society tells people to \"scream for help\" when theyre in danger, and it is terrible advice. Most people will not help, and I learned that on that day. They wont even help a child screaming for help. We are all on our own, and since us women arent great at defending ourselves, well, we just have to hope nobody really targets us, because if they do we are screwed. It is what it is, but that doesnt mean it doesnt suck. Before then I had hoped we as humans were better than that, but that situation took off those particular rose glasses.",

A tazer on the other hand interacts electrically with the muscles and basically causes them to misfire and seize up. \n\nA tazer shoots out barbs with a compressed air cartridge or can be used to dry stun like a stun gun. A stun gun only works on direct contact, like a cattle prod. So you have to be close up to someone.",

I think to this day he thinks I was just a sore loser, but I genuinely felt like I was having a panic attack as everything you refer to in your second paragraph came home to me for the first time.

Only she was about 30 at the time and should have known better. \n\nSince she was a kid she was super into BJJ, judo, karate, MMA etc. She had some bad experiences as a kid and being able to defend herself is a really big deal to her. She\u2019s been in different classes non stop since she was 12. \n\nMy martial arts training begins and ends with mortal kombat. \n\nAnyway, one day she get the idea to bring me to her gym and show me some shit. I\u2019m 6 inches taller and 85 pounds heavier than her. I can literally toss her across the room with one hand. Sure she can get me in an armbar or a chokehold if I let her. But the thing is I had to let her. I could peasily snap her wrist like a twig if I wanted to. She\u2019s tiny. So even when she outmaneuvered me 10 times in a row, (which she definitely did) as long as I could grab her wrist or ankle even I could easily get of anything she could throw at me. \n\nI think the biggest shock to her was after when I told her I was concentrating more on trying not to hurt her than trying actually \u201cfight\u201d her. I felt pretty bad and she actually got pretty depressed about it. I\u2019m not that big of a guy and her realizing that I easily could have held her down and done anything I wanted to her did not feel good.",

It never really occurred to me to punch her back because a) I was kind of embarrassingly frozen in shock. B) I just knew that it would turn me from a clear victim into something more muddled.\n\nBut despite all this I never really felt in actual danger. Once the little knife was kicked onto the rail track, I could tell by the first punches she landed on my face that I was in no real danger. It was going to hurt in the morning with a black eye and a split lip etc But I was i no danger of getting put on the ground and pounded until I was actually injured.\n\nI sometimes think of what possessed that young girl to think she could genuinely beat up a full grown man. It must purely have been a) drugs and b) never knowing the sheer strength difference as discussed throughout this thread.",

What happens next depends on a variety of things. It can be a turn on or a turn off, reality check or push deeper into delusion, moment of reflection or joke.

She was reasonably athletic (hs athlete in her mid 20s) but she weighed like 115 pounds so..\n\nShe wasn\u2019t very careful and used to jog at night around town lake w no phone. It really freaked me out as their were numerous sexual assaults in the area. I\u2019d be nervous every time she went w/o me. \n\nShe told me that I was being sexist and she could fight off an attacker. I couldn\u2019t believe she actually thought that and told her I could take her down so much easier than she realized. She asked me to go for it, like multiple times. Told me she\u2019d fight back, so I grabbed her and pinned her to the bed like it was nothing. \n\nI told her while she was pinned down that I was like 25% trying. Then I told her to imagine a guy in a rapey berserker mode who was actually punching her.  \n\nIt really freaked her out. It was like the first time she really realized how much stronger men are than women. She honestly thought it was like a 10% difference before that moment. \n\nI felt kind of bad, but she stopped jogging alone in super sketch areas.",

I was genuinely shocked and a bit scared, even though he let me go straight away. \n\nI\u2019m 41 now and after doing weight training and some cardio for the first time ever, I\u2019m in the best shape of my life, after doing zero exercise up until 5 years ago. I\u2019ve been doing weights with a trainer for around 2 & half years. I think I\u2019m possibly the strongest woman at my (admittedly small) gym, maybe in the top 3, aside from the co-owner who\u2019s been training for 15+ years. However, my husband - who works in an office - can also easily overpower me when we\u2019re playing around. Ok, he\u2019s a bit bigger than me and does karate after very recently getting back into it after 20years, but I\u2019m technically fitter than he is\u2026and it still doesn\u2019t really make any difference. \n\nI\u2019m a feminist so I very much support the idea that someone\u2019s sex or gender identity shouldn\u2019t be a barrier to their ambitions and hopes. However, I think many women would benefit with a more truthful outlook when it comes to physical comparisons with men. Yes, if a woman wants to be a weightlifter or firefighter or athlete or whatever, fantastic. But they must realise that there are limitations placed there not by misogyny, but by reality.",

It's an undeniable fact of biology that the average man is built to be more powerful than the average woman. It's not an insult or a judgement, it's just nature. Lifting weights and bulking up muscle can still only do so much, but learning how to use your size vs. their size, leverage, and all that - that's the real way a woman can learn to defend and protect herself with much less fear of being randomly overpowered.\n\nThe martial arts have been teaching people how to protect and defend themselves against larger, stronger opponents for centuries. Millenia, even. There's no shame in having the body nature gave you, but knowing how to use it to its fullest, and use a potential opponent's own size against them - that can give a great sense of security and empowerment, which I'm fully in favor of.",

Shotokai is all about not bruising yourself against a stronger opponent by \"hitting back\" as a block - i.e. absorbing the force of their arm strike with your own strike so both forearms end up sore. Instead you just sort of gently (quickly) push their strike to the side. That sort of thing. You don't need to do a lot to deflect a blow aside, and it's way less painful than a full collision (and bonus, can throw the enemy off balance, allowing fast follow ups).\n\nThe best defense is to just backstep so they miss entirely (again causing loss of balance if they over committed), next is light deflection so they don't hit but you don't get sore from blocking... basically a full on block or taking a hit somewhere is the absolute last line of defense. It's a fantastic style for light or less strong people, who are quick on their feet, and lets you use balance and speed as active weapons.",

One day she absolutely flipped out on me over something minor and really made a go at me. I don\u2019t remember what she picked up, but it was something that would have hurt and likely break skin. I took it out of her hand and pinned her against the wall with both of her wrists held above her head with one hand and pressed my hip against her abdomen so she couldn\u2019t kick me in the crotch. She tired out and calmed down after a few minutes. She looked shocked, though. I think she realized I could have always really hurt her but just didn\u2019t, no matter how much she\u2019d fly into a rage. \n\nLuckily that was the only relationship I\u2019ve ever had like that.

Managing a family as a housewife is again multitasking to the nth power and if you're working and doing housework then even more.\n\nI think the main purpose of the differences was that men and women can complement each other as a couple with the man with the physical strength and the women with her management skills and supporting men in their bad decision",

A lot of times he\u2019d hold me down, and I\u2019ll struggle a little bit and eventually give in (but I never put too much effort in the struggle).\n\nOne time when I got to his place he asked if I wanted to have sex and I said no because I was sweaty and I stank and I wanted to shower first. He said he didn\u2019t mind, then he hugged me and tried to pull me into the room. Even if he didn\u2019t mind, I very much did. So I tried to get free so I could just take a quick shower then we could get to business.\n\nI was pretty shocked when I couldn\u2019t get free despite my very best effort. He effortlessly half-carried/half-dragged me into the room and threw me down the bed and I wanted to cry. He had my arms pinned down and I was still trying to get free. I couldn\u2019t say anything bc my whole focus was trying to get get free.\n\nIt took him a couple of minutes to realize I seriously didn\u2019t want it and we both felt really bad. We didn\u2019t talk for the rest of the day and things went downhill after that because we never really talked about it.\n\nI never realized why I felt so bad about the whole thing. This happened years ago but I still feel confused about it. It feels kinda freeing to finally understand why I was terrified and so upset even though I knew he never meant to hurt me.",

I never really thought about that. \n\nJoe Rogan is a moron on so many levels, but what I do believe he is correct on is transgendered athletes and sports. It is not fair to allow transgender women to compete with cisgender women in most sports, and in sports like boxing, MMA and other combat sports, I feel that it is dangerous. Not because I have anything against transgendered people - I am all for people living their truth - but because of biology. Heavy doses of testosterone during puberty induce significant strength-related sexual dimorphisms - denser, larger bones, more muscle mass overall as well - and these changes do not suddenly go away with estrogen therapy. I don't like to watch bloodsport because I don't like to see people get hurt, and most of my friends are the same way, but some of my female friends would argue vociferously for the right of the transgendered women to fight in MMA. \n\nI never realized that some of it might be that my female friends do not fully understand the difference in strength between men and women. After all, I don't think my female friends have ever been really assaulted or forced to come to terms with that strength difference. And honestly my male friends and I aren't the most muscular or aggressive bunch either, so the delta probably isn't that high in our friend group anyway.",

Most people breakup due to several things, not just one. When you look at this story they weren't the best at recognizing what the other wanted or needed. She did not listen when he asked her to stop and he made fun of her instead of de-escalating the situation when she felt vulnerable.

Men end up, on average moving more weight and thus practicing their strength more. Women are taught to avoid those tasks and miss out.\n\nLastly, there's play fighting. Boys are encouraged to do it more than girls. People who don't practice swinging at something with intention and strength will usually mentally limit their own expressed strength. So girls can end up less comfortable in their own body because they've never tried it like that.",

Never again would she get into a physical fight with me. She got the point, and her era of dominance was over forever. Which I felt was a bit unfair, insofar as my fighting record was now 1-50.

Kinda just like a firm kick like when you're trying to kick a soccer ball with precision, but not force (that's about as accurate of an analogy as I can make lol). She stopped on her tracks, and I legit saw her almost tear up instantly as she hurried to her room (to cry, I suppose).\n\nI'm imagining she went through something similar most females have talked about in this thread.

Also, good luck getting good at it, not many places for you to train properly. Maybe if you had an endless supply of defenseless minorities that are treated worse than insects to practice on then you could get good at it.",

The point of Krav Maga isn't to win, its point is to intimidate those you want to hold power over (offensive), or it's to do whatever it takes to survive (Defensive). \n\nShould you bother learning it?\n\nI'd definitely recommend learning any style you come across and Krav Maga is no exception. It offers excellent easy-to-learn defensive strategies to stay alive and if you're in the business of oppressing the weak it can be an incredibly useful tool to threaten the population with. \n\nIs it useful for winning a fight?\n\nNot unless you're up against someone who has no fighting experience. As I said it's useful for survival and not for winning. You could be a Krav Maga pro and you'd get the shit kicked out of you in a close-quarters fight by a half-decent fighter of another style (unarmed). One of the two main goals of Krav Maga is to keep you alive and one of the best ways to do that is to create an opening and then run away as fast as you can. Krav Maga helps you create that opening. It isn't designed to let you go toe to toe with a skilled fighter. It teaches you how to get out of bad situations in one piece and that is an incredibly valuable skill.",

The whole \"don't hit her, she's a girl!!!\" tends to be drilled rather early on and is usually a very strongly held social taboo, so by the time there's an actual real difference in strength a girl won't be on the receiving end. Hopefully, that is. And any attempt at physical violence, serious or not, would be met with as little force as possible. A self-centered person may perceive that as others being of comparable strength to themselves.\n\nI've had similar experience with my gf when we were around 20. She took up some martial arts and was convinced she could take most men in a fight, and after a playful argument asked me to seriously try to pretend I'm assaulting her. She was very rudely disabused. There was literally nothing she could do against a man without any fighting experience who made every effort not to actually harm and hurt her. Luckily she was a well-adjusted human, so that situation just led to her re-evaluating that particular view and not us breaking up. That came later, when I found out she has been cheating on me for a year+ with multiple men and gave me a treatable STD as a farewell gift.",

So if you TRULY believe someone, man *or woman*, is capable of hurting you, and wants to hurt you too, your best bet is basically *never* a contest of raw strength, but 1, threats like a knife, taser or pepper spray, 2, using those things also or 3, if you don't have that, a surprise punch or kick to a sensitive or fragile body part, with a tool if possible, without holding back. Then a few more maybe, before getting the fuck out of there. *Exactly* how much strength you have is most often irrelevant, you can be bigger and stronger and still ragdoll after one punch.",

An attack can be for any reason. Proving how small your dick is, getting some valuables, molesting someone, revenge scare, rape, kidnapping and so on. Murder isn't the only reason you might be attacked. And a knife can deter a good chunk of the attackers who don't want to gamble on getting cut or stabbed.

He carried pepper spray, and when he was attacked, he pepper sprayed the dude.\n\n The dude took it straight to the eyes and mouth, coughed, wiped his eyes and calmly said \"Now, you shouldn't have done that.\" Then proceeded to bet the ever loving hell out of this guy. \n\n Based on this, and my time in the motor, where they made us spend time in a room filled with tear gas (it was bad, but not that bad) I am of the opinion the various sprays are a great way to get yourself hurt, badly.\n\n Really a real powerful tazer that actually has the power to knock someone on their ass is probably the best option, cause that gives you time to get away.\n\n Also, in the U.S. a gun is a good option, but any time a weapon is introduced to a fight the risk of losing the weapon should be considered.",

I had odd friends, all of us regardless of size and general toughness could shake off pepper spray and as OP references, it's SOP in boot and LEO training to experience the spray and still pull off an assigned task. Quite a few videos floating around of law enforcement using full on mace and it being ineffective against those in heightened states.\n\nDoes make it very hard to see though, but have to use that moment of surprise and blindness to run or mete out serious violence as you have now upped the stakes of the confrontation. Don't get me wrong, it's very,very painful, but pain alone isn't a limiting factor when adrenaline is in the picture. It's spray and run or spray and hit, sounds like in the story above it was \"spray and stay\" which isn't a motto anyone is teaching.",

So I may have been somewhat mocking, flirting, and generally being an arse about the whole thing.\n\nSo when OP's GF feels like she has been lied to, and that there was a breach of trust... come on, how the fuck are you supposed to take this seriously, when her reasons for those feelings are so ridiculous?\n\nWhen the response is mocking and being an arse about it... Well, what is GF supposed to think here? That she and her feelings are important and legitimate? Or that she is a joke? I don't see how she would have much of a choice here.\n\nAnd a flirting (???) response to all of this... I don't know what that means but... Fuck me, that's a lot more difficult to parse than all the rest. In the face of OP's newly revealed physical superiority, \"flirtyness\" about the fact that he is stronger in a fight, that his GF wouldn't ever have stood a whiff of a chance, and that she has always been at his mercy, can probably drift into \"uncomfortably rapey\" territory really fast...\n\nSo when I read that paragraph here, I can at least imagine a reasonable scenario where OP's GF might just have seen some red flags rising... I don't think they were there, but I can see how the kind of response OP describes here could have reflected very very badly on him.",

What you know beyond those doubts is that they are laughing at you now...\n\n\\>Somehow, the girlfriend thought that she was the chosen one who would be different?\n\nThere is a difference between knowing that intellectually and experiencing it. If someone does not playfight and test their strength against someone of the other gender, you can intellectually know all of that, without knowing what that feels like, and without thinking about how big that difference is in practice.\n\nIt took me some time and a few trusting relationships before practically realizing that: \"Wow, it really seems girls in general are that much weaker...\"\n\n\\>OP was probably joking and flirting because he didn\u2019t realize his girlfriend was nuts\n\nSo I guess I was nuts too up to my late teens, for not knowing how much weaker girls are, compared to a similarly built man.

And I always assumed I had a chance against a guy that was roughly my same size, especially when I was really physically fit. It can be really scary realizing just how vulnerable you are. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s the real reason why OP\u2019s girlfriend was so upset, but she just didn\u2019t understand her feelings and it was easier to get mad at him for \u201clying\u201d than admit how vulnerable she was physically.",

She was a firecracker from a very small town, and had grown up with 2 brothers. She spent a lot of time hunting and doing outdoor activities with her family, so I guess she thought I was a wimp because I didn't. I mean, I'm a bit of a geeky person, I'm short and I'm not one of those super masculine guys. I don't really care for sports, but I played hockey and soccer well into my 20s, and I grew up chopping wood with my dad every winter, she just never knew that version of me. I look small, and I dress to complement my shape, but I've always been well over 200lbs. She was maybe 120lbs. Naturally when she'd try to wrestle me, I'd give in - she was hot. I may be a geek, but I wasn't an idiot.\n\nOne day she was being more brazen than usual, and was being a bit too lippy while she was wrestling me. I wasn't in the mood, grabbed her by the hips and picked her up over my head. She was shocked, and asked how I did it. I told I'd always been able to do that. She decided she wanted to test me and challenged me to an arm wrestle... it didn't work out for her. She was half pissy with me for the rest of the weekend, and I just laughed at her. Told I never once said I wasn't strong (relative to my size - I'm not as strong as a lot of my friends at the gym), and that the assumption was her fault. The relationship didn't last. I'm not competitive, and it became really annoying.\n\nAfter we stopped seeing one another, she started going to the gym with me, and for the first little while, she would try to match my lifts. She had a real hate on for not being able to lift what I did. It used to be kind of cute, but it got annoying fast.",

She was at our place one evening, telling us how she'd learned hand-to-hand combat and could even take on men.  I said something like \"you really don't want to take on men hand-to-hand, you'll lose badly\".  She assured me she was able to fight anybody with her training.\n\nI stood up and said come here and don't hold back - show us what you mean.  I thought she'd go for a nut kick which would have made some sense.  Instead, I have no idea what she was trying.  I simply grabbed both her wrists (gently) and pulled them straight above her head.  I then put one leg behind her and pushed her back (gently) and let her trip.  I lowered her to the ground, sat on her thighs, transferred both wrists to one hand and pinned her hands over her head.  It took me a couple of seconds and that's because I was doing it in a way that wouldn't hurt her.\n\nShe just looked up and said \"Oh my God\".\n\nI showed her that while she was pinned to the ground helpless I had a free hand available.  I tried to get my girlfriend to come tickle her but she said \"I'll be alone with her at some point and I'm not as big as you\".  The friend was relieved and I let her up.\n\nI made her promise that she wouldn't try to actually fight men and she assured me that after that she had no intention of ever trying that again.  It really made me wonder what they were teaching the ladies at boot camp.",

Would dress up, do her hair, makeup, etc. but when she got on the mat she was an absolute menace. She routinely beat the boys (even though this was a very lightweight class, but still) and she made it to state I believe both her junior and senior years. Now she obviously would\u2019ve been manhandled had she tried to go up some weight classes, but where she lacked in physical strength, she made up for in agility, endurance, and just wrestling IQ. \n\nShe actually just won a bronze medal for the US in Tokyo this past summer in the womens wrestling competition, which is pretty neat as well!

Men are also more resistant to concussions, higher bone density, etc. I lost to a girl wrestler in highschool since she was better and I was out of shape.

There is also the Biddle which is more difficult and is used in California at Los Angles County and Orange County Fire departments. Both of these departments do not accept the CPAT.\n\nLike I said earlier the CPAT is used as a base physical ability test. You still have to go through typically a shortened or full 8-16 week fire academy and pass all of the physical and knowledge tests to become a probie firefighter. The CPAT is a good indicator to departments that you can pass their academy but doesn\u2019t guarantee anything.\n\nEdit: Grammer",

It\u2019s a base requirement to apply for a fire departments fire academy to hopefully become a probationary FF. The CPAT is not a replacement for the physical tests and training you go through while in a full academy. \n\nI don\u2019t have an issue with females becoming FF\u2019s if they can pass academy, probationary year, and maintain that level or close to it for their career. However I don\u2019t think the standards should have been lowered for  trainee\u2019s regardless of gender. \n\nAre female FF\u2019s worse then male FF\u2019s? That\u2019s a bit of a loaded question. There are a lot of qualities besides physical abilities that can make a person a better or worse FF. There are some awful female FF\u2019s and some awful male FF\u2019s. If your crew has to pick up your slack continuously because you can\u2019t perform the job then that\u2019s a problem regardless of gender and I have seen and heard about it going both ways. For the number of female FF\u2019s who can\u2019t preform the job to the standard there are just as many or more overweight out of shape male FF\u2019s who can\u2019t any more either. Departments should do a better job with yearly physical requirements. \n\nAnyway In regards to purely physical ability since that\u2019s what we are discussing? Yes females are worse. \n\nSome exceptional women can typically be pretty close to or on par physically to the average male firefighter. They can find work arounds and techniques to complete physical tasks that they can\u2019t muscle through such as throwing ladders with more emphasis on their legs but when pushed to more extremes that gap widens quite a bit. Reaching that level of fitness and MAINTAINING it puts women at a much higher chance of injuring themselves from over exhaustion or strain on a fire ground. (I think the statistic is women are 30% more likely to sustain injury vs male FF\u2019s while on the job IIRC)",

The thing is, if race as a category has no utility, then why is there so much success in predicting it from seemingly irrelevant information? [How can a neural net pick up on the differences in racial characteristics from a skeleton, even when it's been altered beyond recognition?](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2107/2107.10356.pdf) \n\n> The prime example being that the biological differences in terms of genetic code shows that Africans within Africa are more different to each other than they are different to non-Africans.\n\nThat's because Africa is a massive continent, and people are not being specific enough. African-Americans for instance, have an ancestry that is predominately west-African. If I can tell someone is African-American, then that tells me with great probability that they are more likely to be affected by sickle cell trait as opposed to someone who is almost entirely Irish.\n\nedit: Linked the wrong paper.

Remember the difference is biggest in upper body strength and grip. Deadlift and Bench press is pretty tough for your upper body and grip.\n\n>I understand there is a larger pool for males in these sports but I doubt that is enough to make up the difference.\n\nYeah, I don't have any numbers either in how many men and women compete in power and weight lifting.\n\nAnd we also should be very careful when comparing records and competitions. If we want to know who is strongest in absolute measure you will get One individual and he will be a man. If we talk of the population we need to take in to account the outliers - and men do tend to have a bigger spread in performance.\n\n>Do you have some sources for this. Sounds interesting but also abit fishy.\n\nSure, what kind of sources do you want? Do you want scientific articles or more of debate articles? (I'm gonna look up some sources when I get to the computer)\n\nEdit: \n\n\"The findings suggest that the sex difference in muscular strength in equally trained men and women is almost entirely accounted for by the difference in muscle size. For occupations and sports activities in which strength is important, FFW and limb FFCSA may be more valid qualification criteria than sex.\" From 1987, but good.\n\n[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140138708969760](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140138708969760)\n\n\"Less expected was the gender related distribution of hand-grip strength: 90% of females produced less force than 95% of males.\" Interesting on the subject of grip strenght.\n\n[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-006-0351-1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00421-006-0351-1)\n\n\"The women were approximately 52% and 66% as strong as the men in the upper and lower body respectively. \"\n\n\"No significant gender difference was found in the strength to CSA ratio for elbow flexion or knee extension, in biceps fiber number (180,620 in men vs 156,872 in women), muscle area to fiber area ratio in the vastus lateralis 451,468 vs 465,007) or any motor unit characteristics. Data suggest that the greater strength of the men was due primarily to larger fibers. The greater gender difference in upper body strength can probably be attributed to the fact that women tend to have a lower proportion of their lean tissue distributed in the upper body.\"\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8477683/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8477683/)\n\n\"Significantly greater (p < 0.05) 1RMBP and BPT adjusted for LBM were detected in men than in women. No significant gender differences after adjusting for LBM were detected for 1RMSQ  \n(p = 0.945); 1RMDE (p = 0.472) and CMJP (p = 0.656).\"\n\n\"Superior performances adjusted for MT and LBM in men compared to women, may be related to gender differences in muscle morphology and LBM distribution, respectively.\"\n\n[https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/6/1/17/pdf](https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/6/1/17/pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It has been proven that although men typically have better performances in sports such as sprinting, distance running and swimming, given the proportional difference in height and muscle area, women are actually stronger in these events. In the absence of external-weighted load, women can be considered to be the supreme sex in sports reliant on rhythmic use of muscular coordination.\"\n\n\"All in all, it is true that women are generally not as strong as men. It is also true, however, that much of this lies simply in how the bodies of men and women are built for different purposes. Because of differing size and function, the same muscles groups and potential for strength-gain work on different scales.\"\n\nPretty decent article - balanced and fair.\n\n[https://www.livestrong.com/article/355987-female-male-muscles/](https://www.livestrong.com/article/355987-female-male-muscles/)\n\n\"This examination of male and female world-record performances in   \npowerlifting found that the gender differences in strength are not as significant when body weight is taken into consideration. In relation to body weight, the world-record performances by women in the squat and the deadlift ranged from 65.766 \u2013 76.984% and 69.032 \u2013 78.519% of their male counterparts, respectively, compared to the reported range of 60 \u2013 80% for   \ngender differences in absolute lower-body strength.\"\n\n\"In fact, 14 of the 21 (66.67%) world records by women have been  \nestablished since June 1997. This suggests that women have not reached their  \nperformance potential in the three powerlifts and are closing the gap in gender differences in strength.\"\n\nFound this one right now when I was trying to look up how many women that actually competed. (From 2002 - I have no idea how its now)\n\n[https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/brzycki/files/mb-2002-01.pdf](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/brzycki/files/mb-2002-01.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRumor:\n\nI've read somewhere, cant find it right now, that since men do have more type II muscle fibres (Strong explosive fibers) and women have more type I - that in test of 1RM men always have a big advantage. But if we test 3RM or 10RM and compensate for LBM women don't fall behind much at all. Unfortunately I can't find any studies that deals in other than 1RM right now.",

It's weird being a completely non athletic male and being able to pretty easily overpower a state record holding powerlifting female (obviously, all in play). Everytime I perform any show of strength over her she says, \"fucking testosterone!\" and I totally feel that because I literally did zero work to be able to do whatever it was while she worked her ass off for years for that muscle.

He then picked me up with one arm, said \u201csorry lil man\u201d and went into the bathroom. Super nice dude though. The linebackers were the kindest athletes I ever met.",

It literally felt like I got hit with a dodgeball throw by a 4 year old. And then she held her fingers up to her mouth and said meekly, \"oops\". I knew in that moment that she was trying to actually punch me but it was so pathetic I felt sorry for her and couldn't help trying to fight back laughter. She apologized and said she pictured me flying across the room when she did it. I never got around to actually teaching her how to throw a punch. Even a 5'2\" 130lb girl can still throw a bunch hard enough to knock out a 6'2\" 260lb guy. A few years later, my brother's gf showed me that is absolutely true.",

In college i dated this soccer player who had super strong thighs. She could pick me up (6ft 225) and walk a few steps. She knew how strong men were because she had brothers. But, her brothers are both 5\u20197, 5\u20198 sub 200lb guys. They could lift her, but it wasnt just easy. We went to a concert and she couldnt see so i lifted her by the waist to put her on my shoulders and she legit shrieked. I put her back down and she said omg, ive never been lifted like a child like that. She was like 120, did she really think she was too heavy to pick up. Back then, my clean was 300+",

So I knew from that, from play fighting with my brother, and from sparring with others that men were always going to overpower me despite me being above average muscle and height.\n\nThe first time a man used his body against mine was unfortunately during rape, and I knew the only thing I could do was make it as boring as possible. \n\nLater when my now husband held me down during a play fight I had to really work not to panic. I know I'm safe, but he doesn't know (and will never know) just how terrified I had been and how much I rely on him around other men. \n\nSo this awakening can be very jarring and handling this new experience without the support of others can be very difficult. She's not crazy, she's trying to navigate a fact that probably changes her entire sense of safety in this world.",

We had a volatile relationship with lots of arguments (but the sex was great).  Many times she tended to hit me. At which point I left the room.   One argument she would not let me walk out of the room.  She followed me to any room I went to.   I finally just lay down on the bed and she climbed on top of me and started hitting me.  I reached up and slapped her. Not hard. It surprised her, not hurt her.  The look on her face was complete shock.  She left the room crying.\n\nThe next day she came up and asked me, \"You could have hit me at any time in the last two years, but you never have. Even after I hit you, you never hit me.  Why?\"  I replied, \"I'm  much stronger than you and it would not have been fair.  That's not the type of person I am.\"   She then said, \"I'm sorry that I took advantage of that. And thank you for never hitting me.  I'll try not to ever hit you again.\"\n\nShe never hit me after that.  We still argued (and the sex was still great), but she never became violent.",

I'm 6'2\", 285 lbs, and build like a shed.  I've never gotten an xray in my life without someone coming up to me to discuss my dinosaur bones.  I'm build like a brick outhouse, I guess, is my point.  \n\n\nMy current partner is feisty but rather tiny, 5'3\"ish and at the time of this story kicking around 125 lbs, tops.  We'd been working on arm bars and transitioning to back-mount for chokes and stuff, basic guard work, that sort of thing, and usually \"sparred\" in a playfighting kind of way.  Obviously, in doing this, I'm not going full out, trying to bounce the back of their head off the living room floor or anything, instead applying enough pressure and force to simulate a challenge while at the same giving them the space to try things and scramble.  \n\n\nWell, they locked up a very nice arm-bar, much more quickly than I anticipated, and had it on nice if a little too tight for my liking.  I was using my one arm to keep my other from straightening, so with my feet planted, I heaved them from the floor and hoisted them well above my head, pressing them against the 7-ish foot ceilings in my apartment and, as they remember it, literally roaring in their face.  They fell down me like a steep hill, I barely caught them before the splat-thump.   \n\n\nMy partner was legit shaken; they knew I was stronger, that I was playing with them and letting them get their reps in, build some confidence and muscle memory, etc, but they had no idea what the difference was between their strength, and they are very strong for their size, and what someone built like me was genuinely capable of.  \n\n\nSmall-ish folk don't really get it.  It's not just a scaling up of their strength, the leverage, the weight you can put behind something, the upper limits of your grip strength and so on are well beyond what most people imagine.  It's pretty great and I wouldn't trade it for comfortably sitting on airplanes or in the backseat of hatchbacks.",

Since the average man is about 5 inches taller and usually far more muscled than the average women, this difference is probably far more extreme than 37% between the average man and woman of the same ethnicity. Probably more like 100% or greater. Of course this should be common sense (not sure what OPs ex was thinking) but it's nice to have the scientific base line for how strength differs between the sexes",

This friend from out of town\u2014from what I remember\u2014was a 5\u2019 2\u201d, 120lb female, at best.  I\u2019m a 6\u2019 1\u201d, 205lb male:  I\u2019m by no means a physical beast, but I am a full sized, naturally athletic male.  At the time, I was about 25 years old, and I think she was the same. \n\nAnyhoo\u2026 at some point in this get together there sprang a play fight: snack food throwing, noogies, wet willies, and tickling. None of this was started by me, but I got roped into it.  My weapon of choice was tickling, because it was the only thing I could think to do without hurting any of the females around.  Anyway, I got got with a wet willy, and I retaliated by chasing my friend down to the couch, accompanied by playful laughter all around, and tickling her as she fell on the couch.  \n\nFUUWHAPPP!!! Bright lights.  Ringing ear.  That extraordinarily enraging pain that radiates from injured upper ear cartilage.  \n\nI was stunned for a moment.  When I collected myself, the room was dead quiet, all fun halting to a screeching stop, I had a look around.  Next to me was the out of town friend. She was glaring me down, fists closed, mouth closed, nostrils flaring, with staggered feet.  She had ran up on my side while I was rough housing with our mutual friend.\n\nI don\u2019t know if many females understand instinctual rage as well as males do, but my primordial impulse to kill whatever just did that was dialed into 11.  I stared at this creature for what felt like an hour.  A part of me telling myself, \u201cyou can\u2019t hit her, she\u2019s a woman.\u201d Another part telling me \u201cthis animal is trying to kill you, fight back, now.\u201d\n\nIt was the first time I had ever had to consider hitting a woman.  I never even thought I would have had such an inner dialogue.  Why the fuck would I hit a girl?  I\u2019m not an abusive dick.  Why would would a woman ever punch me in the face?  \n\nAnyway, I didn\u2019t hit her.  I was so unnerved that there was something in me that would have urged me to hit woman, that I wound up leaving soon after.  Within minutes, actually. I didn\u2019t understand what I was feeling.  \n\nIt took me a long time to process all that.  I was attacked.  I was hurt physically and embarrasse.  \u201cLike \u2026 why?\u201d  We were all having fun just moments ago.  What the fuck did I do?  She hit me, and then she got in a stance for fuck\u2019s sake!  She activated a part of me that I had only associated with getting into fights with other threatening males (not bragging about that or proud of it).  That thing in question does not discern male from female only threat from non threat. \n\nAll the while, she apparently thought she could take me!  Which frightened me even more!  I mean, I\u2019m a rather civilized male; at least I\u2019ve been trained to not strike females my whole life.  What has she been taught?  I always wondered if she would ever run into the wrong guy with something like that one day.  I hope not.  But seriously, she was ready to throw fisticuffs.  She must have believed she could take me, and she had no idea, that even I, not some superhero sized guy, could have seriously hurt her if I was inclined to act like some unrestrained animal.  \n\nLater I found out she was psychologically kind of fucked up and wasn\u2019t gay, but was like gay for her childhood friend who was my mutual friend, and I think she thought I was flirting with the tickling and laughing and all that\u2014which was not at all the case.  She just got jealous and lost control, gave me swift rounded strike to the side of my face and caught some of my ear.\n\nWhat a fucking night.\n\nEdit:  sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear about this: I was not tickling or touching the woman who hit me In anyway.  I was rough housing with the woman that was our mutual friend.  This friend and I had a well established, platonic, brother/sister type of friendship.  I had enough sense, even over a decade ago, to not touch females that I am not very familiar with even in a playful way. I\u2019ve always tried my best to make women feel comfortable around me.  Apparently, I fucked that up with this one woman \u2014 lol.",

In the end, I suffered a sore ear for a couple days, and avoided going to jail, as well as the social stigma of punching and seriously harming a much smaller human being.  I could certainly conceive of a time where a male might have to actually defend himself against a female, but this was not that time for me.  It was strange thing that I had never experienced at the time: that a female, a much smaller and weaker human than me, would have thought that we had comparable strength for any reason at all, and that she could and was willing to try to stand toe-to-toe with me in a fist fight.  Later experience revealed that a not insignificant sub population of females do think they can offer comparable levels of physicality with respect to males, and I still am not sure what informs that.  In general, I encourage you to restrain yourself if you find yourself in a similar situation.  If for any reason at all, the police might not see it your way.  \n\nNot to mention, the third female in this situation that I didn\u2019t write about much would later become my wife, but we were only just \u201ctalking\u201d at this particular point in time.

But instead of teaching about our biological differences at the same time that we talk about our biological commonalities, we just lump it all in together.\n\n\nAnd it's believable because girls are quite physical before puberty and boys really aren't any stronger than girls before puberty.  So if you have clear memories of wresting with your brother or a male friend as a kid, you probably remember - correctly - that you were pretty evenly matched.  But when boys hit around 13 or so, their strength just goes through the roof while girls' strength has a more gradual incline that never approaches the boys' peak.  But since girls typically don't seriously wrestle boys at this age, they may not find out the truth.",

Some idiots think that some of our very real differences implies some intrinsic superiority over the other.  In reality, for all the fucked up shit between the sexes through history, men and women have, in some sense, been cooperating in the shared goal of sending their respective DNA into the future.  Whatever differences we have, seem to be just some way that our biology has been divided and economized under evolutionary pressure in order to adapt, survive, and procreate.  None of this is to say our differences are intrinsically good, bad, moral, immoral or whatever, just that they are real, and we inherited all of that history and biology.  We are certainly more alike than we are different, and we need to be nuanced in the way that we think about and recognize our differences.",

Testosterone is a drug, a wonder drug when it comes to strength. \n\nThe drug also runs a high. Maybe I\u2019m wrong but I think every man has been in a fight and at least a few of them barely remember the fight but rather ***the rage***. I remember one fight, I was maybe 13-14? and a neighbourhood kid (a year or two younger) was antagonizing THE FUCK out of me. Final straw was when he shot me point blank with a BB gun while I was talking to someone. We squared off, and I don\u2019t even remember getting hit but had cuts from being hit with the butt of the gun. I do remember my hands and shirt covered in his blood, mainly from his bloody nose and lip and I remember stomping on his head\u2026 before people dragged me off of him. \n\nNot my proudest moment, but decades later I remember the rush, and I remember it feeling good.

That\u2019s probably my social training.  \n\nI also agree, there is some degree of confusion on this matter, and a significant amount of females do not understand the general disparity in strength and physicality between male and female physical capacity.  \n\nFrom what I was later told, my friend and her out of town friend had a good argument after I left.  Luckily, everyone agreed she was completely out of line and lucky.  I think my friend was only friends with her because they grew up together and she kinda always was friends out of guilt a little bit.  The out of town friend was no psychologically stable and had some emotional and social problems.  My friend was pretty much her only friend growing up, sort of thing, and that was kind of the basis for her misplaced sexual feelings\u2014from what I was later told.\n\nAnyway, despite all the ill talk of gender norms, I think it\u2019s for the best that males generally take as much on the chin as they can when it comes to physical interaction with women.  In may case it was my ear \u2014 lol.\n\n\nEdit: also, society generally favors women in these matters because of the disparity in strength, and a lot bitch ass men beat up on women.  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right for women to falsely accuse men, when such a thing happens, but I can imagine for law enforcement they see it the other way around so often that they don\u2019t always believe it can happen.",

I gently grab her arm to get a better look, finger and thumb prints line up identically. We were both disconcerted because neither of us remembered anything that caused pain or even serious pressure, yet she had 5 serious bruises. And apparently didn't bruise super easily.\n\nSlightly less fun was a girl at a party. I'd been talking idly earlier about bruises - I find some bruises strangely sexy, specifically on the hip bones. No idea why, and the idea of bruising someone is gross to me. This girl decided to intentionally smack her hip on the door frame a few times for the bruise, then kept asking me to bruise her... She was clearly and publicly consenting, and I would've loved to be intimate with her that night, but no damn way would I hit her to bruise her after she'd just bruised herself.

I grabbed her backpack not realizing it would throw off her balance and it made her fall. I asked if she was okay and helped her up but it didn't matter. That girl was on me in seconds. I remember her reaching out towards me so I grabbed her hands and we stood there for several minutes, me trying to calm her down while also trying to refrain from beating up a kid 3 years younger than me. She was also short and stout so she had a reputation for being pretty strong and I remember other kids making fun of me for not being able to take her. I'm like, wtf? I'm not going to beat up a literal child even if she's trying to beat me up. \n\nBut yeah they definitely had problems at home and she was in therapy and stuff later so there was a lot going on with those two sisters.",

It can easily devastate someone's self worth considering that if a man wants to hurt them, they're powerless against it. Or that when men play with them, they're being compared to mere puppies. just consider what that's like for a moment. \n\nYou can have a proud personality, be confident in your skills, be as smart as they come, but at the end of the day you'll never be able to have the strength to back up your life against a male without another male involved. Your safety and way of life is entirely dependent on whether a group of men wants to humor your existence(even if it's in a 'benevolent' kind of way, and not, say, the 'need more babies. I like sex. Guess we can tolerate you'' sort of way).\n\nReality is that divide exists. Sometimes I want to escape into a fantasy where it doesn't.",

I think the most universally relatable comparison is when someone experiences grief of a chronic injury(I experienced this myself, and there's sense of less-than, being a burden, being useless, hating yourself/resentment ect. that damn near mirrors the feeling). It's actually really neat to understand because of the crossover, which  can help bridge that gap of understanding and pull people out of it. It's applicable to everyone, so maybe more of an enjoyable read? Maybe more comfortable or easier to digest, which is always nice. \n\nXD man, as an older sibling I'm sorry on behalf of all older sibling pranks and show-ups. It's a full time profession.",

There were the big ones, like penises and vaginas and breasts, and I always assumed a lot of things I was told were just stereotypes.\n\nWhen I was still 19 years old (before I came out as trans) I truly genuinely believed that there were a lot of women who were stronger than a lot of men, because despite going to the gym every other day I struggled to win play fights with my girlfriend.\n\nWhen I eventually came out and started hormone therapy, it only took me a few months to *feel* the difference. Even though I was considered \u201cweak\u201d by guy standards, I could lift most things I would want to without really thinking about it.\n\nAfter just a few months without Testosterone I struggled to even lift my computer. I had to ask my housemate to move my bed for me, and regularly had to ask for help to open jars.\n\nThe first time I slept with a guy and he grabbed both of my hands with one of his, I tried to fight back and there was literally *nothing*, literally *no give* at all. That was the moment I understood the strength difference and it honestly caught me by surprise too.\n\nObviously you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but you can understand how someone may be shocked if they just never knew before.",

(Now before anyone starts any shit about hitting women and domestic violence shit, I had ran this scenario by some cop friends of mine and as long as she and I were wearing boxing gloves it was a training session and not domestic violence and I didn't want to really hurt her)  She started swinging, all being worthless misses, blocks or glancing.  Then I popped her 3 times in succession in her forehead. Put her back on her big ass.  She got up and took off the gloves.  Proved her hill billy freestyle was not as good as she thought.  She also hasn't put those gloves back on since.",

We moved to an apartment that wasn't in a bad neighborhood, but near one and the parking lot wasn't well lit. I told her to always call me when she left work so I could meet her at her car to get her inside safely. She actually believed she could handle being attacked because of how well she did wrestling with me, (6' tall, 230pounds weightlifter at the time).\n\nThe third time she didn't make that call I explained how I only went \u00bc strength or less when we wrestled, she wanted proof. In 45 seconds I took her to the floor and stripped her scrub bottoms off and held her in position to be raped if that was my intention. She was flabbergasted that none of the normal moves worked against a serious opponent. She called every time after that and had me teach her how to use a handgun and get her permit to carry.",

Avoid some parts of the area that we live in, travel in a group, always park near stores in lighted areas, be aware of others, the sort of thing that can mitigate victimization. \n\nAny community can have shopping centers or business parks that are not patrolled by security, not well lit, that are adjacent to high crime areas. Avoid those places late in the evening and certainly after dark. It may seem paranoid to train my family to avoid these places, but we've never been accosted in any way while others have. Our group of medium to small cities has high crime areas still. It should not, but businesses don't care if a few of their poorer customers get robbed as long as most spend money in those places. So lighting and security don't matter to them.",

      "text": "Having read all the comments, I actually find the girl's perspective pretty understandable and relatable, even. Some people are saying the fighting was a sign she wanted to abuse you, but you have said the fighting from her side was always in play so I assume this wasn't the case.\n\nBeing overpowered can be absolutely terrifying and unsettling - if your partner who you trust (and had the impression you were on an equal footing on physically) suddenly did that I can imagine how that could pull the rug out right from under you in terms of how you see yourself. \n\nI can't speak for why she genuinely didn't realise you were stronger but as some other people have mentioned, it is definitely the case that women are encouraged to think of themselves as equal in all ways these days. If you've never genuinely fought a man, how would you know, really? There's a general understanding among most people that guys are stronger but in everyday life it's not really outlined on a 1-to-1 basis as to what that looks like. What I'm saying is unless she had brothers she fought with or some hobby like sport / gym where she would compete against guys, I can see how it might be possible she just didn't realise bc of no experience.\n\nE.g: my partner and I used to play-fight and once he showed me (consensually) how easily he could pin me down with his hands if he wanted to. It wasn't a nice experience even though I trust him to not hurt me and definitely made me feel more scared when going outside, especially at night. I had been under the impression that the odds were good that I could at least 'hold my own' if I was attacked. Neither of us worked out and there's not a huge difference in size between us so it's not like he was a huge bodybuilder or anything either, he's pretty slim. Although I vaguely thought he was a bit stronger, I didn't really realise the difference was so great.\n\nNobody likes feeling helpless and vulnerable. It made me feel gross inside/shamed for a while in a way that's kind of hard to describe - maybe it's a hit to the ego on some level, I guess.\n\nIMO the big TIFU here is not the playing along with the fighting, but the mocking of her afterwards. Your ex-gf didn't really handle things very well, that's true, but it reads to me that she may have been embarrassed and feeling 'gross' from that sudden realisation that she was a lot more helpless than she liked to believe. \n\nIf my partner had mocked me about something like that, even if I had started it, I would have been VERY upset and it definitely would have made me see him differently from then on. There's some comments saying she's crazy and things like that, but I'm sure almost everyone (guys and girls) knows just how viscerally angry and emotional people can get when you're upset and someone makes fun of you, even if what you're upset about is dumb in hindsight. Friendships have soured over less! TBH it's not that surprising (to me) that she broke up with you. \n\nNever mind though, these things happen. Sounds like both of you learned from it, anyway!",

Put down because of all the social indoctrination about what a woman is, should and shouldn't do. Proped up because women have just as many rights, are just as inteligent and just as \"capable\" on ALL fronts as men.\n\nThe \"proping up\" part is mostly right, aside from usually physical strength, which by default women are inferior at than men. Exceptions here of course, but we're talking a very small minority. Women generally are extremely weak physically, especially if they have to go against say, a regular adult man, let alone one that regularily goes to a gym or one of those really strong men that run strength competitions or do physical work for a living.\n\nAnd most women, while I think are aware aren't as physically strong as men, don't really have a proper estimation about the difference in power between sexes. They might've played and (literally and physically) hit on some boys now and then, but they never made a man have to go against them in a physical way at 100% capacity.\n\nI think it's also why unfortunately some women are ridiculously entitled and think it's just fine to slap, punch or even kick a man they are annoyed with in a conversation.\n\nAnd when a regular dude shows a partial amount of his average adult man strenght, girls are knocked the fuck out or just in complete disarray, like their reality has been broken and not believing a man can actually be this strong, because she thought \"men can't be THAT MUCH stronger than women\".\n\nI guess OP's girlfriend's reality crumbled that day. She doesn't know anything anymore and she needs time. And OP shouldn't EVER get back together with her, because if she was this delusioned in the first place, who knows with what else she was delusional.",

It wasn't just that she was dumb enough to think that she was stronger than her boyfriend, she wanted to use that strength to force him to do what she wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>One day, we were chilling on the sofa, watching a show when I realised, I was running late to meet some friends. I told her I need to shower and make a move, she decided this was a good time for a playfight. She sat on top of me to pin my arms under her knees. I played along and \u201cstruggled\u201d to move her off me. A little more \u2018wrestling\u2019 took place, with me playing along like I do. Then I told her I really need to make a move. She was not done and continued to hold/push me back onto the sofa.\n\nNow just imagine this isn't a \"playfight\". From her perspective, she's not playing. She's using her dominance over her to keep him from going to his friends.  \nShe didn't just break up with her partner because he was \"lying\"--she broke up with him because the entire dynamic of their relationship changed in her mind. She wasn't just \"playing\" with him. In her mind, she really had spent months shoving her boyfriend over furniture, holding him capture, physically restraining him, etc. She enjoyed her ability to dominate him physically, and losing that was a fatal blow to her conception of the power dynamic in the relationship.  \nI don't think everyone here appreciates just how fucked up this all is.",

She look very surprised. Had a talk about it and she said she wasn\u2019t expecting that much of a strength difference, like she knew I was stronger than I let on but not like overpowering. She also informed me she had been waiting for me to \u201csnap\u201d because I\u2019ve always been a dom, however not a like big one cause I always worry I would hurt her.

It really damaged my self esteem, as well as putting a damper on my view of him by making me trust him less. Please just be honest from the start.

Well, I eventually married a man who was a *very* good chess player, with a higher ranking than mine. Over the decade of our marriage we played chess once a week or so, and very surprisingly I won, ~10 out of 12 games. I was shocked, but chuffed. Fast forward to one weekend when we played a lot and he trounced me every game. During our final game that weekend (and forever) it dawned on me that he\u2019d been letting me win *on purpose.*  I said something and he smirked. I was furious, not because I\u2019d lost, but because he\u2019d ostensibly been deceiving, (not to mention condescending to) me our entire marriage. He later had an affair with my best friend, and I remember thinking I was madder about the chess) I\u2019d rather lose to him in 500 chess games than be handed a single dishonest win. FYI, my former BFF dumped him after 5 years. OP, I know it\u2019s different, and you were being playful and not competing with her,but just maybe your gf felt somewhat like I did about \u201cwinning\u201d unfairly.",

Or at least, normal people don't break up over something like that.\n\nSo either a) she was genuinely crazy, b) there were one or more relationship problems that you're not mentioning, or c) there were one or more relationship problems that, to this day, you didn't even realize were in play.\n\nI hope for your sake it's 'b'.",

Men's muscles are more dense and wired for performance. Our bone structure and density give us leverage. Sure there are some outliers on either side, but I would hope that women aren't walking alone at night thinking they can fight guys off like they do in action movies.

We handily beat them.\n\nI remember feeling how they were gauging us as we walked in, kind of snickering and giggling. Most of us had hit puberty and had scrawny arms and clown shoes for feet. They just couldn\u2019t match up against us at all. Their passes were too slow, easy to jump. They couldn\u2019t create any separation by dribbling or screens. They could not break a full court press at all. Conversely they could not match our offense\u2019s speed on the perimeter, they couldn\u2019t fight over a screen, their help side defense was too slow, they could not stop our forwards from positioning in the paint.\n\nIt felt nice to beat them but also it was so weird afterwards to see how defeated and confused they were. They were a great team in their own right and went on to win maybe 2 playoff games, but you could tell it really knocked them down a rung or two in confidence.",

      "text": "About 20 years ago I had a girlfriend who liked to wrestle and fight too. She was bi, but like 90% lesbian. And in all her relationships with women, she was always very much the dominant one in the relationship.\n\nI knew from the get go that she had some anger management issues but we were dating more out of convenience than anything. I was in an extremely overbearing Christian college at the time (like\u2026 RAs would use their master keys to do \u2018bedchecks\u2019 at 10pm every single night). So having someplace to go crash on the weekends with someone I got along with was a nice situation. We both knew it wasn\u2019t something long term and just enjoyed what we had. \n\nThat is, until one day we were wrestling around playfully and she \u201cheld me down\u201d and licked my forehead. I laughed and told her to stop, but she just licked my nose. I smiled and asked her more forcefully to stop and she licked my cheek. These weren\u2019t little playful licks. These were big slobbery, full-tongue licks. \n\nSo I lifted her into the air and rolled. I ended up on top of her and started licking her face. She laughed and tried to push me up like I did to her, but she couldn\u2019t. Then I could tell a switch had been flipped. She realized she wasn\u2019t actually capable of \u2018manhandling\u2019 me like she always did with her girlfriends. \n\nAs soon as I saw that she was angry I got up off of her and she stormed off into the kitchen. I figured she was just getting some space and calming down but she came back with a chef\u2019s knife screaming that she\u2019d show me who the boss is. \n\nYup. I noped it right on out of there as fast as possible and never went back. So much so that I lost a full set of clothes and a bunch of dvds. But it wasn\u2019t worth going back to get them. Even though I had a key and could have gone while she was at work. Last thing I needed was her having her neighbor (who she was friends with) calling the cops on me. \n\nShe and I didn\u2019t keep in touch but a mutual friend of ours told me that she wound up getting fired and arrested for throwing a computer monitor at her boss a couple of months later, then taking a swing at the cop that came to escort her out. She had to go to therapy and anger management courses and all that stuff. \n\nI bumped into her a few years ago at a movie theater. She was seated in the row behind me and a few seats down. I realized it when I went to my seat. She saw me too and asked if I\u2019d like it if she went and sat somewhere else. I told her to just come sit next to me and we\u2019ll watch the movie together (I was alone anyway). We talked a while after the movie. And I gave her a ride home (she lived like 3-4 blocks from the theater but her apartment was in a bad part of town). Nothing came from it and we never saw each other again after that. But she seemed way more well balanced and mellow. Funny old world.",

Men and women can be of the same strength but the reality is that if they weigh the same, and look to be of the same size, men are going to have more muscle and women more body fat on average. This is the main argument against intergender sports. Weight classes just don't work when the average weight of the genders is not evenly distributed. Now, take a normally athletic 6ft tall woman that is in good shape and pit her against a normally athletic 5ft8 man and she will have a weight, strength, and reach advantage. It works both ways, but the average is that men grow to be larger and stronger than women even if they might appear of the same build externally(which if we're honest isn't terribly common to begin with)",

Most women live in a sort of bubble when it comes to strength: they compete with other women, but rarely with men in physical sports. Most women are lucky enough that they've never had meaningful physical altercations with men. \n\nAs men we're generally told to be gentle and respectful. I've never felt the need to physically overpower a woman. You don't go full strength; especially if it's just playfighting.\n\nAs a result, a lot of women think the strength gap is quite a bit smaller than it actually is. That's actually quite dangerous.\n\nI've shown a few of them my 'actual man strength' over the years when EXPLICITLY requested to do so. Just a bit of arm wrestling or a proper bear hug gets the point across. Without fail, they are shocked at how large that strength gap truly is. Even a relatively fit women just doesn't have the strength to overpower me if I don't want her to. \n\nWhich is why I'm a BIG proponent of teaching girls and women proper self defense techniques. You might not have the strength, but you CAN make it an unpleasant fight for would-be attackers.",

I am always surprised when the teenage girls I teach say they can 'handle' a guy trying to grab them.  Or think they could compete in mens sports other than riding where your horse equalizes the equation. I was 14 and sorted out when my brother hit 16 I could no longer hold my own And had to stop beating on him. I had ridden horses, cleaned stalls and loaded hay bales since 9 years old. I had also had basic biology by that point. Compared to other girls I was very strong.  Until boys got hit with testosterone I was just as strong as them also. It is not politically correct to teach girls that basic biology in most cases blesses boys with much stronger, faster muscles. So while in situations that do not require physical strength i am the equal of any man, I am smart enough to to know I am not physically going up against a man and win. My BF plays with me also and is careful not to use that strength against me but I know it is there. I also am well aware that he is capable of protecting me if some other male decides social constraints do not apply to him. Basic biology is a reality.",

      "text": "This reminds me of my guy best friend in college. We weren't dating due to personal reasons but both of us liked each other and had admitted it. \n\nHe was always calm and pretty quiet but could destroy anyone if it came to a battle of wits. We bantered almost 24/7 and it was excruciating for me to try to match his sailer's mouth. I grew up in a conservative household and my knowledge of swear words was next to none. He took advantage of this fact and poked fun at me all the time. \n\nAfter telling me he liked me though, his personality did a full 180. No longer was he the calm cool guy i knew. He blushed at *everything*. He blushed at *hand holding.* I took full advantage of it. Every time he tried to poke fun at me I would just make eye contact, rub slow circles on the back of his hand with my thumb, or if i was feeling especially vindictive, I would press my leg against his thigh. Always succeeded in turning him into a blushing stuttering mess. \n\nHe just always seemed so submissive-ish I guess I just subconsciously falsely assumed he wasn't thaaaat strong??? Dunno. He wasn't big on sports either and I played all sorts of sports, went to the gym regularly, and wrestled a lot in high school. Sometimes we play-fought and I won every time. I even won all the arm-wrestling matches and thumb wars. \n\nThen in school one day the guys in my class decide to have an impromptu wrestling match just for kicks. They dragged him into it too and I remember being a bit worried for him, thinking he was going to get beat up. \n\nInstead he won every round and even won against 2 guys at once. Everyone was cheering for him and I stood there completely absolutely *stupefied.* When I asked him why he was faking being weak around me he said the same thing you did: \"Did you really think we were equally strong?\" Took me some time to come to terms with the fact that all those times I pinned him down it was just because he let me do it",

I felt so weirdly embarrassed and like an utter idiot at the time.  \n\nUm this might seem silly but a few days later after he dropped the whole 'weak act' thing, the stark difference in our strength started becoming more obvious. He once held both my wrists with one hand while he did his homework with the other and I tried my absolute best to get out of his hold but couldn't even budge. Literally felt tears well up in my eyes but my pride didn't let me cry. \n\nInstead I asked him to teach me a bit and wrestle with me more seriously. In return I helped him with studies. Was fun while it lasted. At least now I can throw a mean punch",

Proper breathing and weight displacement, knowing vulnerable spots, waiting for opportunities to seize.\n\nYou either have to be dumb as fuck to think otherwise or she was looking for an excuse.

So, when we were on a lovely date talking about future plans while walking the beach near where I lived at the time, and I was put in a situation that resulted in a physical altercation with another male. Not provoked by her or I, just some dude looking for trouble. She was extremely surprised at how quickly my temper escalated and how quickly I managed to handle the situation and remove her from potential harm. And I guess, how bad I hurt the other guy. (He was bleeding from his nose, mouth, and I snapped his left arm, breaking through shin, bleeding profusely) \nI\u2019d think this would have made her more, I guess feel protected while with me. Unfortunately, the opposite was the realization of how my soon to be wife would react. \nShe explained weeks afterwards, (weeks of keeping her distance physically and weeks of hearing her speak softly to me) how seeing my temper flare and the existent I\u2019m will to go to when presented with a situation as such, made her feel inadequate and weak. \nI didn\u2019t understand at the time what the problem was and why it was feeling like she\u2019s now scared of me, or as if I\u2019d hurt her in anyway if she was to upset me.

I think a lot of the feminist propaganda that talks about equality between the genders makes a lot of women think that the genders really are equal in every way and to be confronted with the truth years or decades later can be very disturbing to some.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/X7gwEyDV_Ps",

      "text": "Back when we were in our 20s my wife started taking some kickboxing class for exercise and after she got pretty good at it she would start play fighting.\n\nEventually she made some comment about how she liked being able to protect herself and I told her to be realistic, she was still a girl, if even a small man wanted to overpower her he could.\n\nShe looked at me like I was crazy. \"You do realize that, right? I  much, much stronger than you, like it's not even close. Unless you get in a lucky shot to the balls you have zero chance of actually winning an actual fight with someone like me.\"  I'm 5'11\" and larger than average build, but at the time I was pretty overweight and never exercised. I hadn't been in a physical fight since college. She was tall for a girl (5'8\"-9\"ish) and probably 140lbs with well-defined muscles and overall very well toned.\n\nShe looked as if I had claimed the earth was flat. \"I'm stronger than you are. I work out three times a week.\"\n\nEventually I said to try arm wrestling. It was like Apollo Creed trying to slam Drago's gloves, she simply couldn't move my arm at all. I finally just slowly started pushing hers down at which point she grabbed our fists with her other hand and unsuccessfully tried to stop it. She somehow concluded that my arm wrestling victory was due to my being fat and having longer arms (???) insisting that in a real fight she could more than hold her own.\n\nI was genuinely trying to hold my laughter while explaining that she was like a child to me, it was simply a matter of muscle mass, I was much, much stronger than she would ever be. She insisted that I put my money where my mouth was. I told her that I didn't want to hurt her. She laughed (!!!) and assured me she would be just fine.\n\nThis was before phones had cameras in them so instead of recording her saying she wanted this I made her write out a statement claiming that she wanted this and sign her name. If she ended up with a black eye I wanted to be able to show people proof of what went down.\n\nThe house we lived in at the time had a huge master bedroom with a large open carpeted space, so we decided to have our mini-kumite there. She started like stretching and hopping around asking me if I was certain I wanted her to go \"all out\" because she didn't want to really hurt me. I told her to go as hard as she could, I was worried. She got a smug look on her face and said something like \"You asked for it!\"\n\nShe got in some kind of stance she learned in class and kind of side hopped towards me, I just stood there in the guy \"dukes up\" position and waited. She came at me and did some kind of side kick that landed almost on my shoulder and it was like she kicked a tree. Her foot hit me and just stopped. The look on her face when I didn't go flying sideways was priceless, it simply didn't make sense to her that I wasn't laying on the ground.\n\nI reached out and grabbed her by the back of the neck, carry-dragged her to the bed, and shoved her face into the comforter, holding her down. She might as well have been welded to the bed, she was really struggling as hard as she could, but I had her pinned with just one hand. \"This is where the bad guy would start raping you\" I explained. \n\nShe finally gave up and I let her go. She was PISSED. I think her instructor had been overselling the abilities they were training for. \"I'm pretty sure I could kick her ass, too.\"\n\nThen we had three kids and she left me to bang some drunk guy.",

That is worlds different than stating the biological fact that men are naturally stronger at any and all ages than women. By your logic you should be spray painting incel across the homes and cars of people responsible for separating mens and womens sports because they state the obvious facts that \"men have an unfair advantage of physical strength compared to women\" by your logic you should be burning every educational book on human anatomy which says men are naturally physically superior to women when it comes to strength. I keep trying to explain that i said nothing \"incel\" and that i was only stating facts. If i carried an incel attitude i would have said something like \"stupid weak women think they can actually overpower a man?\" I stated a simple fact. I thought it was a red flag because how in the world does a fully grown female not know men are naturally stronger than them? Why in the world would ops girlfriend attack him after then dump him?

I believe there's a right way to explain the difference, but it really requires some emotional guidance and support on the parent's behalf. \n\nThe question is: How do you deal with actual, real, tangible helplessness without devolving into self disgust and resentment? I don't think people have considered that. \n\nIt's kind of like, gaining a major injury, and learning you'll never walk again. You've lost a part of your agency (even if it's merely perceived) Your self image has changed, most often for the worst. You might feel disgust at your own helplessness and weakness. You might feel worthless and useless, how you'll most likely have to rely on others until the day you die. However...instead of supporting the patient and guiding you through that, doctors ignore you, while peers make comments about how they can't understand why you'd be upset about not walking. After all, you were born that way, and that's life! A friend tries to help by saying they'll do the walking for you, but it's not really the same as walking for yourself is it? \n\n\nWith this in mind, is it a surprise that many women have complexes revolving around strength and independence?  We gotta teach reality, that's a given. But how it's taught needs better attention and reworking.",

No. The average guy will be stronger than the average woman and even stronger than most of the above average women. Its just a fact of life. Acting as otherwise is bad, social conditioning is good in some instances. Idk about most guys but i was taught at an early age by my g paw and dad and other men around me that men are stronger and as such have certain responsibilities like a need to be in better control of their anger if not physical violence is always a possibility.  Women should also be aware of this possibility for their own safety. Dont treat us like a ticking time bombs but also don't intentionally mess with our feelings, its just adding extra risk. Most guys i know even give extra leeway to women specifically because we are taught that, you can see the videos on youtube of women intentionally hurting men and them doing nothing. You can also see the opposite and those videos usually turn brutal real quick.  Pick your friends and partners carefully and also act with restraint, at the end of the day we are all humans deserving of respect.",

As a 5' lady, I am very aware that I am at the mercy of most people around me (even middle schoolers can be taller), and that is honestly not a fun realization. I want to be that 6'+ body building dude on the bus that no one wants to breathe on wrong because he might roid rage. Particularly, because my reality is (usually) older men sitting next to me and forcing me into uncomfortable conversations when I can't escape, or even putting their hands on me. I just have to trust that whoever sits next to me won't harass me.\n\nThere is a power dynamic present, whether one wants to acknowledge it or not. Your ex-gf clearly was under the impression she was \"safe\" from a lot of scary realities because she believed her physical abilities shifted this power dynamic to even footing. To have this proven wrong so casually would be VERY scary. \n\nSo she's now hyper-aware that she's at your mercy should you ever choose to become physically abusive. She is highly aware that her life is in your hands. You could legitimately kill her. Domestic violence is real, unexpected, and deadly. Did she react calmly? No. Would I? Probably not.\n\nI get why to you she might have been borderline funny in that moment, but you two were clearly so not on the same emotional plane you didn't understand how scary that whole FU is. Something that should have been said was \"Gee, I'm really sorry honey - I wasn't trying to conceal my strength on purpose. I would never hurt you, so I never use full strength when play wrestling with you. I've really enjoyed the fighting previously, but if it makes you uncomfortable and it doesn't feel like play any more we can stop. What can I do to help you feel safe moving forward?\"",

I did it next, having not worked out in many years, and still pushed 285. Our raw builds are incredibly different. It was eye-opening to her. No amount of working out will ever get her close to my middle-aged dad bod.",

      "text": "I've had 2 incidents before revolving strength. \n\n1 ex, used to go to the gym with me, I'd spend 3-4 hours 5 days a week there, mostly weights and some cardio. She'd do cardio, small weights, then swimming and steam rooms 3 days a week. \n\nI'd be there, beasting on the machines, lifting weights, dumbbells 25kg, she'd do 5s and 7 kgs. \n\nShe had the idea one month she'd arm wrestle me, and I just didn't budge, it went on near every day and she'd stand over me while I sat in a chair or the kitchen table and lean her whole body on my arm trying to twist and turn it, or arms outstretched and trying to push or pull and she'd get a wobble, but far far from getting my hand down to the table or flat. Note: I never actually tried to move my arm, to win.\n\nWell she decided one house party she'd be smart, she'd get her friends to do it too, I was having s good laugh with the lads, drink in hand when she approached and asked for my hand. I knew what was up and was like \" no, come on, not now\" scrunching my face up. Trying to hush her down, leave it be, let's not get into this. \n\nBut no, she HAD to do this now. Everyone else is confused in my group, so I just put my drink in my left hand, offer her my right arm outstretched and go back to ignoring her. Except it wasn't just her. She'd enlisted 2 friends to also help her pull my arm back. So I'm standing there, facing 4 other lads, drink in my left hand, her and two other women pulling my right arm back, it wasn't even to pull down, just back.\n\nSo I get a little serious, I tense up, I'm holding strong, an occasional jerk to my right a bit with rotation, I pull back. The lads are laughing, this is hilarious! I'm taking a swig of my drink now n then playing nonchalant about it. It's been about  2 minutes, and it's lost all its shine, it's not so funny anymore. Everyone is now asking them to stop, and me too. \n\nI say fine, I'll stop.  The three of them let go, and I out my arm down. And that's when she antagonizes me \" so you give up, I win, I knew I would coz you never beat me anyway\". I'm so over this after a month plus the whole room is dying here, it's become embarrassing. I reply \"fine, you want it, you can have it, I'm gonna win then, but I didn't ask for this\" \n\nI put my arm back up out from my side, \"I'm gonna count to three, if you're still there that's your business\". She left off some expliteves but is hanging on firm, arms outstretched clasped around my wrist, feet secured into the floor leaning back like she was gonna go tug of war with my arm. \n\nI counted down, and swung my arm hard. The intent was the wrench my arm from her hands. That's not what happened though. She'd hung on as I swung around, and went with my arm, except rotating in mid air as she did, she almost reached right in front of me upsidedown and no longer hanging in. She went 4ft into the wall of the house and bounced. She broke her wrist in the fall and we left for accident and emergency for a lovely 5 hours waiting at 1am before she was admitted. \n\nWe still dated for another 2 years, but stopped arm wrestling. \n\n\nThe second story is much less dramatic. Another house party, a girl thought she was being playful bumping into me. The first few times it kinda sent me a bit off balance, as it does when you're not expecting it. I grew tired of it quickly and started avoiding her, went out to the back garden where the smokers were, just stood my ground, planted. As expected she escalated her little game and came full speed running into my side. She bounces off me with a thud and started crying. I pretty much ignored her and claimed no knowledge why she did that. Continued my conversation. \n\nTurns out she liked me(heard this from our mutual friends a week later) and thought it was some flirty game to get my attention. I was 22, I was oblivious but past playing stupid games.",

Jars are tight, but not too tight 99% of the time. Things are usually built within standing reach, albeit maybe having to reach on your tip-toes for some things.  Girls? Having a tall person to reach cupboards and a person to open jars is not a joke.  Not only that, but many women are excited when they are able to do a proper push up, think about that.  I don't think I know *any* guy that can't do at least 10-20 pushups if they had to.  This isn't a slight on women by any means, but as Rick James once said ~~cocaine~~ testosterone is a hell of a drug.",

This was spearheaded by white conservative Republicans. \n\nThe movement recently has been for the easy access to guns in rural white areas for \"responsible\" people. \n\nIt would stand to reason that the idea of arming their wives with guns and the propaganda that men are evil and if they try to have sex with their wives would be shot would be met with open hostility.

So her thinking process would have went \"he's actually strong, so he lied to me\" what if another woman is in his life and he's not being truthful?\"\n\nIt's not actually the lie or your physical strength that scared her. They are tuned to freak out and think of the worst scenario. \n\nAnyway, any woman wants attention and to be the center of the guys world ( without clinginess)\n\nIf you responded' you mean so much to me I could never hurt you or make you think you weren't the best because in my eyes..... YOU ARE THE BEST PERIOD\"\n\ninstant win and good feels until she freaks out again. This is women. Welcome. They will say anything to get attention. If you're not making them the center of your world when you go to a restaurant for instance, they will purposely look at other men subconsciously and that will force you to pay attention to them again. They just say whatever is necessary to make sure you are in their thoughts. That means they will be unreasonable whenever they aren't being paid attention to.\n\nAfter realizing this, I have a very good time with all the women in my life ( though I am romantic with only my wife) .this works so well Im bordering manipulative psychopath territory but I do use these powers for good and to keep people happy. I stay loyal to my wife. I promised her when I put a ring on he finger. I can't tell you how many times we had similar fights and it took 4 years to figure her out ( and women in general)\n\nYou're WELCOME.",

Within her \"weight class\" she's pretty handy, but she's only about 60% of my weight. Over the years I have learned to not really play fight back, as she has a few old injuries to the joints in her arms, so it's generally better to trust her to not hit me somewhere painful for me, because if I defend, she can end up punching something that isn't muscle, or fat, and hurt herself.\n\nHowever, (see above) she is well aware of how strong I am, so while dicking about one afternoon she threw a roundhouse kick at me, which I caught. She then used this as leverage and used me as a climbing frame, to climb up, then perch on my shoulder.\n\nWhich is to say, I generally find it more entertaining to not lie about my strength. Although I'm at a size where if I was any bigger, I'd class as a giant, so a woman would have to spend a lot of time in the gym to be able to equal my strength, and if they don't, they'd be delusional to think they could.",

I'm similar in the way that I like to \"wrastle\" and have been with a few guys who play along, it's fun.

Somehow I can twist my legs around someone else's legs like a snake, they're weird.

Men will typically take a step back and let them do what they want rather than risk fighting back or defending themselves which only reinforces the idea that aggression = strength. I\u2019ve seen a lot of girls become abusive in effort to prove themselves. Your girlfriend assaulting you is not okay OP, and it\u2019s clear she has a lot of issues she needs to work through. While I empathize with the struggle her actions were out of line and it\u2019s probably for the best that she takes time to be single.\n\nMy worry is she\u2019ll continue to date kind and patient men and beat on them in an effort to soothe her bruised ego. In the future try to avoid women who think it\u2019s okay to treat you this way even if it doesn\u2019t actually injure or bother you.",

Not a power lifter. Can't shoulder press more than 185 for example. \n\nBut I had a friend who was 5'11F 160lbs. MMA trained fighter. Fitness model/Competitor. And she could kick my ass. We used to party together - drink and she loves to wrestle well she loved to kick my ass. We were just friends. (This definitely was super hot though NGL) Like the only thing going for me was she couldn't choke hold me, but Jesus Mary and Joseph, It was exhausting. It's not always about strength. She is not normal though obviously. I can usually overpower most men. And If me and my friend would arm wrestle I would win but her technique was incredible. I highly recommend women take martial arts if they can and like that sort of thing. Cause there is a level of proficiency that makes strength a bit redundant.",

The thing is when a girl is wearing just a tank top and yoga pants you can tell if she feels a certain way about being immediately taken down and pinned. \nSo it was kind of a \"that day I fucked up\" but you gotta drop a word",

Before I decided to get back to my old muscular shape. I was wrestling with her try to get keys I think.\n\nWell, she tossed them to her friend. So I wrestled her friend down. She tried to take them back. Once I got them they both start trying to pin me down and the other take them back. I was single handily wrestling and beating both of them and having fun. When we were done she was like \u201cthis really put into perspective the difference in our strengths. I think you were just having fun, and I was trying about my hardest and I think she was too.. and you just moved us around as you pleased in a way that was enjoyable and fun for you.

Anyway, most people i know wouldn't associate me with having physical strength, including any relationships i had. An ex of mine would always try and help me every time i'm lifting something, whether its furniture or the shopping. She was being helpful of course and I didn't think anything of it (Coz tbh I liked it when she helped!) One day we were talking about random shit and the topic was 'what should we do if the house caught fire', like emergency procedure. I said to her, 'I would fireman carry you out the house'. She started to laugh and was like 'seriously??' I didn't take offence and laughed along too and then I realised she genuinely thought I couldn't lift her. I then proceeded to perform a firemans carry and ran around the living room with her all playful whilst laughing. She did not laugh one bit. When I put her down she had the same reaction! I was like 'whats wrong?' She went all quiet and said 'nothing' and for the rest of the evening was just sullen. Later in bed she said to me 'my view of you just completely changed.' I got a bit offended and said 'what you thought I was weak?' 'She said 'No, but it made me feel like i didn't really know you at all.' After that conversation, it was all fine and soon after we were joking about it. So perhaps maybe your ex was feeling the same, that she felt the gap between you was being pulled again. Obviously it isn't your fault, but things like this can catch people unaware. The lesson for me was communicating is important (duh!) and I learned in future that I would be as transparent about myself, whether its strength or personality wise.",

There's a reason we have weight classes.\nSo sometimes we do this test where we all line up against the wall and three people go out on the mats.

      "text": "Amusingly, I have a story from the opposite side of this.\n\nI\u2019m pretty bulky. I haven\u2019t been skinny since puberty hit me like a Mack truck on the interstate\u2014I gained sixty pounds over the course of one summer, and didn\u2019t stop until I hit about 220. That\u2019s my body\u2019s default weight, as in even when I exercise and diet and all that stuff, my fat and muscle might switch places, but the weight pretty much stays the same. My ex boyfriend weighed maybe 160 at his heaviest, but usually closer to 140.\n\n(He had once tried to stop me from rolling off the bed, and utterly failed. The look on his face when he went from \u201chaha funny play time\u201d to \u201coh fuck I can\u2019t carry her\u201d is etched into my mind. Not in a bad way, it was genuinely amusing. I laughed to the point of tears when it happened.)\n\nI\u2019m not sure what about me implies that I\u2019m weak, but he seemed to think I couldn\u2019t lift anything heavier than 20 pounds. Which is hilarious, but whatever. One day our smoke detector starting going off for no discernible reason, so we had to take the battery out to make it stop. We had just moved into that apartment, and didn\u2019t have a stepladder or even a chair to stand on (that didn\u2019t have wheels) so he said \u201cI\u2019ll just lift you up.\u201d I laughed directly in his face.\n\nI said, \u201cYou  can\u2019t pick me up. I\u2019ll lift *you* up.\u201d He looked at me like he knew it wouldn\u2019t work but was willing to humor me. So I picked him up and held him (arms wrapped around his butt sort of situation) in the air, very easily, for the amount of time it took him to unscrew the panel on the smoke detector and remove the battery. He was visibly shaken by the realization that I was apparently approximately 10 times stronger than he thought I was. Out of courtesy, I didn\u2019t lift him up for a very long time.\n\nUnfortunately that meant he forgot how strong I was, and when we got really excited about something a few years down the line, I picked him up and spun him around in a sort of celebratory our-sports-team-just-won-and-I\u2019m-80-pounds-heavier-than-you motion. His legs instinctively wrapped around my torso and he let out an involuntary \u201coh shit!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not why we broke up, but he was genuinely a little squeamish about it. I think he was comfortable in the concept of men always being stronger than women (which isn\u2019t necessarily untrue) and I sort of flipped that for him. He was definitely stronger than me, but me being able to lift him up just short circuited him lol.",

I met my SO on the mat 10 years ago doing Hawaiian jujitsu. We LOVE to play fight, and I'm sure he does hold back (though, I suspect, it's more that he chooses passive resistance over active resistance) and if I get stuck in something I can't get out of, or a lock or hold I can't get to stick, we talk through it. We'll work on exit strategies and distractions and repeat whatever it is until I get it right or I tire out. It's a win all around - we get to have fun, I get to learn, and I'm not approaching more potentially dangerous situations with unearned confidence. \n\nSmaller folk of any gender with a physically larger and stronger partner: from a defense perspective, it is hard to overstate the value of playfighting like this and having your partner, someone you trust and who is invested in your comfort and safety, actually put some effort in. Understand what it feels like to have your wrist or arm squeezed in a killer grip. It hurts, sometimes a lot, but if you know what it feels like, and you know what your body can handle, you are far less likely to freeze - because the feeling is not unfamiliar. Same with a pin, a mount, a bear hug, whatever. The unknown is scary! So the more you experience these things (again, safely, with a trusted partner who is paying attention and will stop when you ask!!!!) the more prepared you are to react calmly and strategically of you ever needed to do so in earnest.

Especially one that's trained their body even just a bit. Like it's one thing to see dude with the muscles and think he's big but it's a whole other story when they grab you and smash you to the ground. It's not crazy that a female would think that I guess it's just crazy how careful just about every dude they've been around has to have been with them to maintain that.\n\nLike unless a female is some kind of serious athlete/powerlifter type I can ruin them at mostly everything. Even many of the serious athlete types don't have close to the upper body strength. It's insane someone can go that long through their lives and not inherently know that. And it's pretty nuts she broke up with you because of it. You can say she's a good person but you did nothing wrong and she broke up with you because she's flat out dumb.\n\nEdit: I'd also say something pretty interesting about this post is that for all the fear women tend to have about/around men feeling like we don't care about them or regard their whatever, I think it's kind of missed exactly how gentle we tend to always be with them. Even the most crass roided out freak on earth will be delicate as fuck when a female is around them while that same asshole will barrel right through me hoping I want to fight back.

In your next relationships be on the lookout for this and have a conversation about it, or date someone else. Don't dismiss regular initiation of play fights, punches, whatever it is, it's unhealthy.\n\nYou need to be able to have an effective conversation with someone about feelings in order to resolve fights. This is a skill that comes with age, but not without practice. Some people never learn the skill, and it's not pretty. \n\nSome people (and I'm not saying your ex is one of them) cannot regulate their emotions effectively. Emotional disregulation is a mental illness. Behavior therapy by a psychologist is one effective treatment, so it's not necessarily a permanent problem.

She was just into the semi-rough stuff, you know? But I'll never forget the look on her face when I had to defend myself against a drunk dude at a bar one night. Case of mistaken identity, dude was super hammered, came after me after I held my hands up and tried to defuse the situation. You know how it goes sometimes. I got punched pretty hard, dipped the guy and choked him out. (I'm no skilled fighter but I know how to do some stuff.) She ghosted me for a few days after that. We got to talking later and she said watching me hurt another person freaked her out. Still had a black eye at that point lol. I still think that night was the beginning of the end for us.",

I think of this as when an adult plays with a child you are 100% of the time never going to go full strength because you are playing and you don't want to hurt the child, this is the same case as a your scenario.\n\nThis might have been a deeper psychological issue that triggerd her to react that way that like you said us men really don't fully understand how women think. The only scenario that I would understand her frustration is if she was one of those strong ladies that you saw in the wonder woman movies that look like they could bench press 500 pounds no sweat and you were a lanky skinny dude I would understand how heartbreaking would that be to train that much and still a skinny dude can overpower you but I assume this wasn't the case.

Many women said things along the lines of you really need to teach girls early so that they can maybe appreciate at a younger age that to a large extent... If a man wants to overpower you... He will do that. \n\nThis hopefully ensures that they will realize that they need to be really direct... And if needed... REALLY vicious. \n\nI guess it's a context thing. Women \"know\" that men are stronger... But it's rare (in polite company) for there to be a reason to see how much stronger. \n\nThat knowledge can potentially help avoid some situations.",

      "text": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17186303/  \nHand-grip strength has been identified as one limiting factor for manual lifting and carrying loads. To obtain epidemiologically relevant hand-grip strength data for pre-employment screening, we determined maximal isometric hand-grip strength in 1,654 healthy men and 533 healthy women aged 20-25 years. Moreover, to assess the potential margins for improvement in hand-grip strength of women by training, we studied 60 highly trained elite female athletes from sports known to require high hand-grip forces (judo, handball). Maximal isometric hand-grip force was recorded over 15 s using a handheld hand-grip ergometer. Biometric parameters included lean body mass (LBM) and hand dimensions. Mean maximal hand-grip strength showed the expected clear difference between men (541 N) and women (329 N). Less expected was the gender related distribution of hand-grip strength: 90% of females produced less force than 95% of males. Though female athletes were significantly stronger (444 N) than their untrained female counterparts, this value corresponded to only the 25th percentile of the male subjects. Hand-grip strength was linearly correlated with LBM. Furthermore, both relative hand-grip strength parameters (F (max)/body weight and F (max)/LBM) did not show any correlation to hand dimensions. The present findings show that the differences in hand-grip strength of men and women are larger than previously reported. An appreciable difference still remains when using lean body mass as reference. The results of female national elite athletes even indicate that the strength level attainable by extremely high training will rarely surpass the 50th percentile of untrained or not specifically trained men.",

And honestly I liked it for the same reason. At this time we were already 16 year olds so I was already heavier taller stronger and I would let myself be pushed and all faking like she could make me move. But the truth was I would always restrain myself and let her move me. Even later in our Relationship when we played fighting aka pushing each other off my bed or training to retrain each others arms I never applied full force and never 'won' I was too afraid to hurt her. Meanwhile she could use her whole legs to try not kick but push me and slide me off the bed. She succeeded a few times but to me the game was more to try to stay on the bed becaue I on the other hand could easily move her.",

I, like all the guys there, took it easy with the women, no one was there to hurt each other you know.\n\nWell, over the years she knows she needs my help to carry heavy objects etc and like the people here, I thought she understood that when sparring etc I was always holding back on strength and speed to match her levels. Honestly I did this with everyone because it's the best way people can learn without getting disheartened. Or so I thought. \n\nWell, neither of us have trained in years now and we're both out of shape but: last year during a disagreement she legit attacked me. Straight up bombs to my face. Well, none of them landed and I caught her hands and pinned her to the couch. I wasn't hurting her but I certainly didn't want to be hurt if she caught me. She was destroyed, absolutely terrified. She had no idea just how large the strength gap was and I don't know how. I now think that perhaps we do women no favours when hide the gulf in strength when we train together. I know that's not the whole of the story because a lot of women never have any martial arts training etc. \n\nWhen kids are young, boys and girls have similar strength and for lots of women, the last time they fight or wrestle or rough play etc is when they are kids. As we age and our bodies develop we branch off and while boys fight and things with each other they don't with girls. We as a society drill that into our kids. So most women never realise the divide as they grow up I suppose.",

      "text": "Two similar things happened to me, first this girl I was with would always kind of tease me about being able to beat me up, as I was always very concerned about hurting her.  Well one day, as we were hanging out in a group of people, this guy got a little bit out of line, when he was asked to stop he did not, so I changed his attitude by lifting him up by his neck and holding him against the wall while I explained that he needed to adjust his attitude.  Just to be clear, I didn\u2019t hit him or hurt him, just told him to knock it off.  She took me more seriously after that.\n\nAnother time, back in the early 2000s I was dating this girl in college who for some reason I told her my iq was 139, I think I got it from real geniuses, and she would joke hers was 140.  So one night before dinner i went to my gfs dorm room to find her and her friends huddled around the computer taking some stupid iq test thing.  They made a big deal about me taking it, so I sat down and they gave me some room to work, I finished it in like 5 minutes, and it gave me some score like 154.  So I called over my gf and was like, I\u2019m done with this thing I don\u2019t understand what you girls wanted with this it clearly tells everyone they\u2019re a genius.  However, it turned out that they had not scored as highly and the girl they thought was the smartest person they knew scored a 128 and it took her over a half an hour to complete.  I was like, eh, whatever let\u2019s go get some food.  My gf ended up not speaking to me for a week because she was so upset about some stupid faux iq test that was complete nonsense.\n\nAnyway, the lesson to be learned here is that if you shatter the realities people create for themselves, even if you have done nothing wrong, people will still blame you for it. So either don\u2019t, or expect to pay a price.",

I'm not sure why its so important to her that she be at least as strong or stronger than you but it may may be due to a past experience, fear and/or a need to feel in control. \n\nWomen have our own sources of strength aside from raw physical power that I wouldn't trade, so I'm not sure why she wasn't more gracious in accepting your  strength advantage.",

It was the not understanding that she believed you were similar in strength, combined with a few not so thoughtful comments, that cost you the relationship.   \n\n\nHonestly, when I read this I thought about the reverse situation, a guy play fighting with his girlfriend and she has a much superior strength. And if she assumed the guy always knew she was stronger and said a line like \"Come on babe, you did not really think we are of equal strength, did you?\" How the comments would look on a story like that. The hate and vitriol would be staggering.   \n\n\nI can't see how anyone could fault the girl in the story. It does sound like you learned from your mistake hence this being in TIFU. So if nothing else I hope this was a good learning experience and I hope that she will or did forgive you at some point.   \n\n\nSimple lesson to take from this story for everyone: You can only see the world through your own eyes.

I learned from growing up with angry men and boys that if you want to live and/or not be crippled, you run. \n\nSide note, I understand the feeling of unfairness that men feel about being treated as a potential threat day to day, but if you feel that way, read this thread again. I feel like being offended at that is just as silly as OP's exgf's logic.",

Except I'm in a weird situation where I've been ill for the last couple of years, a combination of backpain and (possibly) an inflammatory condition that I'm hoping will at least be diagnosed soon. One of the things it has really affected is my strength. Stupid things, like not being able to comfortably push a trolley around a supermarket without feeling exhausted. I have to consider everything; is it too heavy? Is it too far? Have I got somewhere halfway to put it down?\n\nEven after more than a year, I don't think my wife has got used to it completely. Helping her up from the floor or up a steep slope isn't easy, like it should be. It takes an extra trip to empty the car. Climbing up and down a ladder to hang that third picture is exhausting. I didn't realise how much for granted I took being stronger than her.",

As an example my gf works out in the gym 4-5 days a week, I on the other hand haven't visited a gym or worked out for years. I could pin her down in seconds, not that she wouldn't give me a struggle but it's just bog standard biology. Nature hasn't built women for upper body strength, that doesn't mean they can't get it or there aren't women who are stronger than some men, but look at any sort of strength sport, the differences are massive between the male and female athletes.\n\nI hope you both can work it out, I guess she just get hit with a little reality and didn't know how to feel about it. Though by the sounds of it you weren't making fun of her, I hope she can realize that.",

I was like 110 lbs and her may be 130-140.  I grabbed her arm as she tried to slap me, stepped up put her into a headlock and dropped us both to ground pinning her in like 2 seconds.

If your SO tells you that they feel like you've being lying to the them whole time, and you care at all about the person, then you'll try to talk about it without mocking them. Sure, it is weird that she thought that you wouldn't be stronger than she is, but sometimes we all miss some obvious things. It's normal. You have, definitely, been there too.",

You never \"lied\" and don't let her gaslight you into thinking you did anything wrong.\n\n1) men are, on average, FAR physically stronger than women. Like not even close. If you take 1000 random males and 1000 random females, for example, the middle-of-the-pack median male will throw a ball harder than 999/1000 of the females. It's that drastic of a discrepancy.\n\n2) you didn't fuck up by \"not talking it through\" or whatever. she can also talk it through. She's an adult who can use her words and her ability to communicate. You did nothing wrong, so you saw no need to make amends. And you were correct. Stop trying to blame yourself and say you don't understand female emotion, or how you should have communicated better, etc.\n\n3) this is a woman's brain on feminism.

That overestimation is part of people's coping mechanism to deal with a world they find intimidating. OP broke that illusion in a cold and callous manner (unintentionally) which understandably upended her worldview but I'm not so sure the ex-gf's illusions are that atypical (certainly exaggerated but not totally atypical).\n\nJust a thought.",

My friend, 'Small' (she called me tall I called her small) got it in her head that she could choke me out. She had four or 5 years experience with Judo, and I did some sports in highschool but I was never really good.\n\nI have a male friend who is about her size with maybe 7 years of judo experience, and he can choke me out 9.9 times out of 10 so I thought I'd let her try. She tried to sweep my leg but couldn't, tried to put me in a head and arm and roll me back but couldn't, and then crawled onto my back. We were incredibly close and often cuddly friends, so it all seemed a little playful in my mind. Then when she was on my back she anchored her foot righ in my hip and since I couldn't see her I thought it was her hand. \n\nI was shocked, and I seized her foot in half a second and held it at arms length. Instead of holding her hand away from my dick (what I thought was happening) her entire body came swinging upside-down and her face almost hit the floor. I was able to set her down without hurting her. She went into the kitchen and cried, and I lost a friend.",

What you were basically saying with this action is that you could do whatever you wanted with her. That's scary.\n\nAnd \"mocking, flirting, and generally being an arse about the whole thing\"? Totally condescending again. You didn't treat her like a partner. You treated her like a plaything. That's what's wrong. Not that you \"hid your strength\".\n\nYou also put her into a risky situation by letting her assume that she could fight back in a man, and by leading her to overestimate her strength.\n\nThat said, hitting people \"for fun\" is not fun, and she shouldn't do that. OP's girlfriend, if you read this, hitting people is not fun, and hitting your partner is not fun. Don't hit people unless you seriously want to hurt them.\n\nI tell guys that a woman could win over a an in a fight, but only by injuring or killing him. That typically shuts them up. So, OP, if you ever want to \"fight\" a woman, be careful she doesn't fight back.",

I stood there helpless as this enigma of a woman slowly tightened her grip until my eyes started to pop out like Arnolds in Total Recall. I could feel my anus prolapsing like a freshly picked red tulip. She leaned in and whispered in my ear \"I want your tummy spaghetti to spill on the floor\". I knew I was in trouble at this point so with my arms at my side I managed to grab a can of spinach which I crushed in my hand with such forced the contents shot into the air where I caught them in my mouth. I felt my biceps become engorged with blood; I broke free of her arms by ripping them off and slapping them against her head like ricky oh making  her head to pop like a melon overly wrapped in rubber bands causing a gaggle of shihtzus to run over and eat her golden apple red head contents. We still laugh and gurgle about it today.",

She was talking to her girl friends about something and some banter happened.  She quipped that she could beat my ass.  I laughed, she tackled me.  Then my two years of cutting trees out of power lines and eight years in the Army came to play.  I get to my stomach, get my legs under me and stand with her across my shoulders, carry her across the room and drop her on the couch with a resounding thump.  She, and her friends never looked at me the same way again.",

When you showed your strength like that, it sort of shattered the fantasy/fetish (which she never communicated or cleared with you - to be fair.)\n\nSomeone better versed in bdsm, or hell, better communication skills would open up a dialogue like \"Hey! I've really enjoyed playing this dominant role! Could we consensually explore doing more of this?\" Rather than stomping off into the sunset.",

He's of course stronger and it takes EVERY bit of my energy but by the end we're both sweating profusely, breathing heavily, and exhausted. More often than not he wins, but when I do succeed in pinning him down (usually by catching him off guard) I feel like a manly man, unstoppable warrior. I grew up with brothers so I was taught how to fight tho. That's probably my biggest advantage.",
