Did you read the rest of my post? Or the post I was responding to? Or are you going to take one sentence out of context in order to \"own\" me? \n\nI'm gonna address your concerns, though:\n\n>The antibacterial soap is an environmental constraint, which is exactly what the mechanism of evolution is shaped by.\n\nYes, the antibacterial soap is the selection pressure that leads to antibiotic resistance...I never said otherwise, because that's true. You're making some strawman, here, because that's not what my post is talking about.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nDo you *really* think that mutations **occur** because of antibiotic soaps? Because I have some bad news for you, bud. That shit is spontaneous, i.e. *random*.\n\nhttps://www.reactgroup.org/toolbox/understand/antibiotic-resistance/mutation-and-selection/\n\nWow, you *really* like being confidently incorrect, huh? \n\n>*\"I see youre a man of culture as well\" is my cancer. *\n\n>Considering it was created as a pro pedophilia meme originally, your gut instinct on it is correct.\n\nIncorrect.\n\nwww.knowyourmeme.com/memes/ah-i-see-youre-a-man-of-culture-as-well\n\n>*\"Well of course i know him, hes me\"*\n\n>It's a quote from a Middle Earth movie, are you surprised it was ever memed?\n\nIncorrect.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1LVt49l6aP8\n\n\n>\"Go touch some grass\"\n\n>This one becoming stupid made me very sad. The original intent behind 'go touch grass' was to convince people to take a break from toxic online culture and to remember that the real world isn't that terrible, and maybe we could all use more fresh air. Unfortunately, aggressive use of it has turned it to infer the subject is a basement dweller, and used as a belittling tactic. Which is a shame because most of us could use more nature time.\n\nThis is likely incorrect as well, but I'm willing to give you a pass on it because its origins aren't verifiable.\n\n>Oh look another low karma aged shitposter account coming to be a total assmunch in the comments. WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED!?\n\nAnyway, you got pretty upset over a gentle ribbing, so maybe you should go touch some grass.",

Any time I've been unfortunate to come across such a meme, the \"follow-up\" comment is just something said by someone else (not the meme writer) or a photo of someone else - not an implied answer to an unasked question.\n\nMy take on it - especially after reading most of the replies here - is that most people who use  the format or think such memes are funny simply don't understand how words / punctuation / formatting work (and of course that nobody is silent).",

Might as well go shout at some clouds. \n\n>And I've always found both examples to be irritating\n\nProbably because you never got to see their original inception, and are more annoyed at the mismemes that followed. \n\nHypothetically, in a better world, being irritated at a misused meme would result in a backlash of correct usage, but since we have become a passive online culture, the primary instinct of the irritated is to deplatform the format instead of working to outpace the misuses with quality work. \n\nThere was a youtube video about shitposting I saw recently that may help, I'll try and dig it up for you.",

It's nonsensical if you only use the literal words, just like a bas relief of a soldier isn't going to magically spring to life. It is not a literal soldier. A stone soldier is nonsensical because it can't fight or move, but in the context of an artistic expression it becomes both more and less than a soldier while still conveying all of the concepts of soldiery that the art piece is layering. \n\nWhen you view the words as a portion of the total context of the meme, you get the same thing. For example, a single line from a popular song used in a meme may itself be nonsensical but the social understanding of the rest of the song gives context to the meme.\n\n>Just because someone has an intended meaning doesn't mean I can't be critical of the fact that what they've actually written not only doesn't mean what they intend but is actually nonsensica\n\nIn this case it is more that it is nonsensical to you because you lack the cultural context, just like someone who never heard the song in my earlier example would feel. \n\n>It doesn't matter what it was originally presented to illustrate. \n\nYou enjoy using words for attention regardless of their meaning, don't you?",

That they are mutually exclusive.\"*\n\nNot true:\n\n* \"If I could of I would of\"\n* \"I could care less!\"\n* \"For all intensive purposes\"\n* \"Is this you're book?\"\n* \"Someone broke into are house\"\n\nThere are plenty of things that do not make sense (as written / used) that are understandable to the listener / reader.   Of course, many instances may simply be typos - but still, as written / used they do not make sense yet still impart an intended meaning understood by both the speaker / writer and the listener / reader.\n\nBut I'll explain further here regarding the meme:\n\nSince the format is that of a script, it makes no sense to write \"No one:   \" because a script would not have a dialogue entry for no one, and for no dialogue.   Having a dialogue entry for no one and no dialogue in a script simply does not make sense.\n\nAdditionally, what no one is saying according to the script is nothing.  In the format of the meme, the scripted conversation / dialogue is in regard to whatever subject  is addressed in the follow-up by the named person/s (at the end / in the \"punchline\").  Let's call that subject \\[X\\].  So, according to the meme, no one is saying nothing about \\[X\\] - and then the named person/s make a statement about or do something with regard to \\[X\\].  So the intended meaning is that everyone else is silent or not doing anything with regard to (or even thinking about) \\[X\\] and then the named person/s bust out saying or doing something regarding \\[X\\] that is unsolicited or unexpected or unwarranted - but that is not what is written / presented.  If no one is saying nothing with regard to \\[X\\], then everyone is saying something about \\[X\\] - before the named person does.  So the subject has already been brought up by everyone and is already in play (also by everyone) - but that is not what is intended with the meme.  What is intended is the exact opposite.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>No one:  \n>  \n>Millennials:  Memes are awesome!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, while the above may impart a specific meaning that both the writer and the reader understand, it is actually nonsensical, both in the format (script) and in terms of the intended meaning (because it actually means that everyone is already saying something about memes).\n\nEdit: Formatting",

I've been dealing with replies over the past two days, many of them from people engaging in personal attacks and simply being rude.  So to be honest I was just tired of it all by the time you initially replied.  Your previous reply (the one I gave the explanation in response to) was clearly in a friendly and positive tone, so I felt I owed you a better reply.  Thank you as well for having the patience for me, even given my initial tone. \ud83d\ude42",

It\u2019s a very common thing on Reddit for people to share posts that are clearly satire and most redditors just can\u2019t pick up on it.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you the reasons for that tbh, would kind of be a cool thing to research, but for some reason Reddit users are horrible at picking up sarcasm. Last week I saw a post of a tweet that was probably the most obvious sarcastic statement I have ever seen in my life. Had to scroll for 2 minutes to find someone pointing out the obvious sarcasm. At least on this video there\u2019s a healthy amount of people who were able to pick up on it.",

My foreskin helps me during penetration since if I don't slip back the \"hood\", I'm able to slide in, pulling the hood back while inside, and growing further.
