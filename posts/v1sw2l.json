After we threw open the floodgates to discrimination against white applicants, many other forms of discrimination became even more common. \n\nI'd tell any young person training for a tech career that they have to factor in pervasive discrimination into their plans. It won't exclude a young person from every job. But say, if you're African American, there will be certain jobs openings that you will encounter that you will or be eligible for, because they have an East Indian only policy. Or if you are Latino or Asian or another race. For American Indians, you'll face all the same discrimination whites face, despite being in this country since the ice age. So the white liberal's magnanimous gesture, in permitting discrimination against working white men, has not helped your career prospects, but hurt them, quite a bit. Even if you are East Indian, and get hired that way, you can be forced into inferior conditions than those of American born applicants, because employers can control your right to live in the country where you work, and that will inevitably result in pay discrimination that affects you adversely (now you see why the magnanimous liberal was so quick to allow discrimination in the East Indian's favor).",

First off,  listen to yourself, because of the negative stereotypes it\u2019s actually harder for blks to get job applications, we\u2019re already ingrained in a loophole where we much show we are not \u201cthugs\u201d or \u201ccriminals\u201d or \u201cuneducated\u201d which forces blks to infact have to work harder to match-up with peers. In fact just having a black name makes it harder. Two decades ago, a landmark study showed job applicants with \u201cBlack-sounding\u201d names were less likely to hear back from employers. In 18 years, despite a boom in unconscious bias training and diversity initiatives, that largely hasn\u2019t changed. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Chicago sent 83,000 fictitious applications for entry-level job postings to 108 Fortune 500 employers, using randomly assigned and racially distinctive names. They found that distinctively Black names on applications with reduced the likelihood of hearing back from an employer by 2.1 percentage points relative to distinctively White names. - source Bloomberg.com \nI\u2019m Also not dismissing the struggles Asians may go through because I also found this study, but to say Asians and yt men have more hardships is laughable.https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/minorities-who-whiten-job-resumes-get-more-interviews",
