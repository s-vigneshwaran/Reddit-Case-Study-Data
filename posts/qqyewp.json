Maybe get rid of the unnecessary adjectives and adverbs that you\u2019ve cloaked your more basic argument in, and restate, bare, as such.

But where I'm from, such a defense wouldn't even be claimed. Our weapon laws are really strict (maybe too strict), and we have no gun culture like that.\n\nTo be honest, while I have little sympathy for Rittenhouse, walking around with a rifle at a riot, I also don't have much sympathy for the guy shot in the biceps. I believe he was there to help and all, and he is a paramedic. That's wonderful! But why was he too bringing a gun?\n\nThat's what I mean with this being weird, from someone that doesn't live in a place where guns are worshiped. Bringing guns to a violent situation is generally immensely stupid, and I would expect a paramedic to know better.",

A lot of veterans do sign up for good reasons. And once they sign on the dotted line, the enlisted basically have no free-will. They follow orders and that is that. \n\nThere are some in the military that contribute to shitty situations. But most of them are non the enlisted. \n\nThink of when an officer tells a enlisted group soldiers to hold a checkpoint. That checkpoint has hundreds of people passing through every day. Each soldier is trying to protect his life and that of his buddies. The day before a checkpoint got blown up by a carbomb. And then someone comes barrelling at the checkpoint in a car because they didn't see the sign and the soldiers shoot a civilian - car had kids in it. Can you really blame the soldiers? This situation happened a lot in Iraq, and I'm sure a lot of soldiers that pulled the trigger blame themselves - and get PTSD. But were they the ones that caused the death? I'm not so sure.",

He was guarding a car dealership at night that nobody asks him to guard. Second of all, he can\u2019t be the aggressor in this. You can\u2019t go to a bar, shoot a guy, and claim self defense shooting 8 other guys who tried to disarm you.

He doesn't need to have a legitimate reason to be there, he only has to be somewhere he has a legal right to be such as public property or property that was not the private property of the person he shot. (if he went to rosenbaums house hed be in trouble, the fact that he was on a car lot that neither him nor rosenbaum owned is kindof a non factor)\n\n\\- Second of all, he can\u2019t be the aggressor in this. You can\u2019t go to a bar, shoot a guy, and claim self defense shooting 8 other guys who tried to disarm you.\n\nThe video evidence clearly demonstrates the three people he shot initiated a confrontation which supports his self defense claim. unless they can prove that he somehow shoved or provoked rosenbaum, huber, or grosskreutz his claim stands on this point. His presence while politically provocative does not meet the legal threshold of provoking an incident.\n\n \\- And third of all, the coroner testified that the fatal shot was in the back; will be difficult to explain that one away\u2026\n\nThe coroner clearly said that 3 shots were in the front and the one in the back was clearly as he was falling. additionally the powder on his hands indicate they were near the gun and he was facing the shooter at the time.",

In such a case, the person engaging in the unlawful conduct is privileged to act in self-defense, but the person is not privileged to resort to the use of force intended or likely to cause death to the person's assailant unless the person reasonably believes he or she has exhausted every other reasonable means to escape from or otherwise avoid death or great bodily harm at the hands of his or her assailant.\n> (b) The privilege lost by provocation may be regained if the actor in good faith withdraws from the fight and gives adequate notice thereof to his or her assailant.",

A guard, dressed in similar clothing to Rittenhouse \u2013 a green shirt, cap, and bag \u2013 put out the dumpster fire, which enraged Rosenbaum, who shouted at the guard. More arson took place and was recorded on video. Rittenhouse was then seen running with a fire extinguisher. According to Rittenhouse's defense attorneys, what was not recorded on video was that he used it to put out one of the fires, which provoked a confrontation by Rosenbaum, who mistook Rittenhouse for the guard who had put out the dumpster fire earlier.\\[44\\]\\[45\\]> First major confrontationThe beginning of the first confrontation between Rittenhouse and Rosenbaum was witnessed by McGinniss to whom it seemed that Rosenbaum and other protesters were moving toward Rittenhouse, who was trying to evade them; Rosenbaum then tried to engage Rittenhouse, but Rittenhouse managed to avoid this by sidestepping and running away.\\[12\\]\\[46\\] FBI infrared footage taken from an overhead airplane captured the shooting of Rosenbaum and the events immediately preceding it.\\[47\\]\\[48\\]> The remainder of Rosenbaum's confrontation, and the following incidents with Huber and Grosskreutz, were recorded in cellphone footage from multiple angles, including the moments of the shooting.\\[49\\] Video footage showed Rittenhouse being pursued across a parking lot by Rosenbaum,\\[38\\] who threw something in Rittenhouse's direction,\\[50\\]\\[46\\] identified as a plastic bag.\\[12\\] As Rittenhouse was running from Rosenbaum, a shot could be heard from Joshua Ziminski, who fired a self-described \"warning shot\" into the air,\\[51\\] causing Rittenhouse to stop running and turn towards the sound of Ziminski's shot.\\[38\\] McGinniss stated that the sound of the shot was the moment Rittenhouse \"went from running away to aiming his weapon.\"\\[51\\]> Then, according to Kenosha County prosecutors, Rosenbaum engaged Rittenhouse and tried to take his rifle from him.\\[52\\]\\[53\\]\\[11\\] Rittenhouse then fired four shots, hitting Rosenbaum in the groin, back, and left hand. The bullets fractured Rosenbaum's pelvis, perforated his right lung and liver, and caused additional minor wounds to his left thigh and forehead.\\[54\\] Rittenhouse remained near Rosenbaum as McGinniss began administering first aid to Rosenbaum.\\[11\\] According to detectives, Rittenhouse was heard saying \"I just killed somebody\" on his cell phone while he was running.\\[11\\] Rosenbaum died shortly afterwards.\\[54\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've watched the video of Rosenbaum getting shot, basically he fell forward after Kyle shot him when he lunged. The last bullet entered his back because he was falling forward, all the shots were fired within a second or two.",

I can quite see how you might not be completely cool headed in a situation like that, but it is still four bullet into an unarmed attacker (though a shot was fired, so Rittenhouse could have been concerned for that).\n\nReading the above report, I can't really see how anyone comes out well and in the right out of this mess. But only one person comes out dead.  \nBut as I often have to remind myself, I'm not American.

He murdered them. Shooting and killing someone is a murder. Which is what he did. Twice.\n\nIf people argue he was \u2018scared\u2019 and it was an \u2018accident\u2019 and \u2018heat of the moment\u2019 then they should be arguing for gun control as accidental passion killing/gun violence is very common. Ofc these people dont want gun control because they are not sincere and arguing on his behalf in bad faith. \n\nIf a socialist had showed up to the \u2018unite the right rally\u2019 in the same circumstances (crossing state lines with firearms to a town not his to protect property or people he had no prior relationship with) and killed two facists, sorry, \u2018classical liberals\u2019, in the same circumstances (they said mean things to him and gave him a bit of a shove), i think these same people who say he should be acquitted would be saying something else.\n\nWhich is to say, the arguments for him being \u2018not guilty\u2019 are being made by people who do not care that he committed a double homicide. Actually they think its based af but are keeping that bit quiet (i mean not really its blatant but they can sometimes seem sincere enough)",

Not to mention it is reasonable for the crowd to have figured Kyle was an active shooter at this point, hence why pursuing him made some sense.\n\nThe last shooting is probably the weakest in terms of self-defense. The guy Kyle shot was trying to de-escalate the situation (very poorly), had his hands up, and Kyle was no longer being attacked.\n\nCorrection: The last guy Kyle shot had his hands in the air at first and then pointed his gun at Kyle. I got the order mixed up. Still don\u2019t think it counts as self-defense, but the argument is stronger than I thought for the third shooting. Apologies.",

No, because he shouldn't have walked into that situation in the first place.\n\nImagine a boxing match and a person walks into the ring, stands between the fighters as they're fighting, and then stabs them both to death because their boxing put him in danger. Is that self defense? No. He shouldn't be there.\n\nRittenhouse crossed state lines with an illegally acquired weapon in order to engage in a protest he had nothing to do with.

Here, that means proving the elements of homicide occurred. The defense is allowed to rebut this argument.\n\nSelf defense is an affirmative defense to the charge of homicide, meaning the defendant has the burden to prove it. Here, that means proving that the elements of self defense apply. The prosecution is allowed to rebut this argument.\n\nFor instance, consent of the victim is an affirmative defense to a charge of battery. The prosecution only has to prove that the elements of battery are satisfied. To be acquitted under a theory of consent, the defense has the burden of proving that affirmative defense applies. Both sides may rebut the other's argument, but the defense doesn't have the burden to disprove the underlying crime, and the prosecution doesn't have the burden to disprove consent.\n\nHope that helps.",

The person who pulled a gun on him was in the act of trying to subdue a murderer, not a smart move but probably felt he should do something about a violent individual roaming the streets with a rifle. He already knew Kyle killed someone, Kyle racked his rifle, he was a clear threat and the victim pulled his gun in his own self defense. The victim's past means nothing in this situation. Kyle is not judge, jury and executioner. He had no business being there and if he wasn't, none of this would have happened.",
