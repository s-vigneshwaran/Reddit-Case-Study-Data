Then they end it with trying hard to fish for meaning of this behavior and chalk it up to \"men are using AI to polish up their abusive behavior so that when they get a real gf, he'll already know how to verbally abuse her\". .... Bruh what??? Are you fucking serious?? \n\nThat is SUCH a reach. And whoever wrote this is clearly not seeing that perhaps these guys are frustrated with being abused by real women, so they abuse an AI instead, which is essentially an emotional punching bag.
