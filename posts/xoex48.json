Just don't put lilies or tuberoses in the house.\n\nI don't even understand people's desire to wear perfume. I can still smell their stink underneath the perfume. It doesn't cover up anything, it just makes it worse. Even passing people on the sidewalk, they have a cloud of smell that follows them in their air wake. The majority of the human population must have a terrible sense of smell.\n\nI saw a Richard Pryor routine once where he described picking up a hitchhiker. He said the guy's body odor was like a physical assault, but the hitchhiker eventually had to get out of the car because he couldn't stand their cologne.",

You are not indigenous, dude.\n\n2) Israelis were not forced from the land. They are the land grabbers. In fact, Jews left of their own accord for millennia. They were emigrating from Palestine before even the Romans.\n\n> the British Mandate allows the Jews to return to their homeland,\n\noooOOOooh the british mandate. The British also deemed it acceptable to take the land of native americans and give it to settler colonizers. Neither are valid.\n\nWhat's this about China? You're so strapped for anything to make your point that you're literally conjuring absurdity, whereas I can actually reference the historical record.\n\nFace it dude, you drank the settler colonizer's kool aid. You're disgraceful for attempting to use native americans as some appeal to authority. Rather, 1/16th authority clown. First supposed native american I've met that thinks they're lucky to have reservations. You sound like a white american pretending to be native american.",

Yeah, they went to those places voluntarily. (This is another case of sarcasm, I'm going to start marking these so you will catch them)\n\nYou don't like me using China, how about Northern Ireland? Does Ireland still have a claim to that? How about Crimea, the Russians have held that for a few years, so Ukraine has no claim to that anymore, right? How do you get to pick and choose who has claim to what? How long does a people have to reclaim their land before they lose all claim to it? A decade, century, millennium?",

I am not under the delusion that Democrats don't use propaganda tactics or that they don't want Republicans to look like bad people. \n\nThat doesn't mean that Republicans are not leaning further towards fascism than they were even 10 years ago though. They are constantly feeding into culture war bullshit, trying to make their religious beliefs laws, have made it abundantly clear that they will never vote to convict a Republican president, and spew constant vitriol towards Hispanic immigrants and Muslims. This itself is not fascism, but it is certainly getting closer. January 6th alone is enough to tell me that there is at least a core group of Republican voters that want to abandon democracy and have an authoritarian leader. The fact that Republican lawmakers refuse to condemn these people and impede on the investigation into it is extremely concerning. There are zero politicians in America in any significant seat of power that are actually pushing for a communist government. There are Republican politicians who want a Christian right wing authoritarian leader though. \n\nSo the difference I see is, when Democrats call people like McConnell a fascist, the comparison has at least some basis in reality, but when Republicans call Democrats Communists (or especially fascists), it is entirely for the purpose of deflection or to deliberately mislead the people listening to them. Tell a Communist that Joe Biden is a Communist and they will laugh in your face.",

Roger Ailes and Lee Atwater make \"liberal\" an epithet to get  H.W. Bush elected\n3. Newt Gingrich engineers even more extreme no-holds-barred political rhetoric to demonize Bill and Hillary Clinton, which brings out the Vince Foster-Whitewater conspiracy theorists\n4. Rush Limbaugh and his fellow right-wing talk-radio grifters monetize this rhetoric into a lifestyle\n5. Fox News captures this audience to push a Tea Party message of Massive Resistance once Obama is elected\n6. Trump harnesses this ginned-up sentiment to grab votes from mainline Republicans",

It\u2019s just easier this way for everyone. You don\u2019t argue with a four-year old about why he shouldn\u2019t eat candy for dinner. You don't punch a mentally handicapped guy even if he punches you first. And you don't argue when a women tells you she's only making 80 cents to your dollar. It's the path of least resistance. You save your energy for more important battles. \n\n[But there's a *lot* to choose from.](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Scott_Adams) \n\nI know the term has become somewhat overused as of late, but I'm fairly confident that Adams suffers from narcissism in a clinical sense. \n\nHe's so convinced of how unfathomably smart he is that if he has trouble understanding something, he'll conclude that the entire thing must somehow be false, up to an including the theory of evolution. If he has a question that he can't easily find a simple and straightforward answer to, then he'll conclude that no one can possibly know the answer to that question, and anyone who claims to must be lying. Whether it's climate change or the death tolls of the Holocaust, that's simply the lens through which he views the world.",

Undoubtedly there was some dumb alcohol-fueled confrontation during the street dance and two idiots came to a tragic end. \n\nSo of course Tucker Carlson and the right wing fear porn machine are taking this one incident and making it all about some wonderful angel who just happened to be a Conservative was ruthlessly and totally out of the blue murdered with a car solely because of a political disagreement. They're desperately trying to make Cayler Ellingson the white George Floyd because they *still* don't understand why the George Floyd incident was such a big thing as all they saw was a drug addict resisting arrest \"fucking around and finding out.\"",

You see George Floyd as a druggie that resisted arrest and \"deserved what he got\" and who was held up as \"an innocent angel\" by all the people you irrationally hate because some dude with a mask of makeup on TV conditioned you for that. George's history with drugs makes no difference, neither did whether or not he was trying to pass a counterfeit bill knowingly or not. \n\nSo weird how those who label themselves as \"Pro-Life\" have such low regard for human life. So strange how those who demand our leaders be strong advocates for Law and Order yet you don't actually care about how our justice system works. Such a mystery how those who try to hoard the title \"Patriot\" and demand strict adherance to the Constitution yet hate the document with such passion and work tirelessly to destroy it.\n\nThis *is* a nation of laws, or at least is supposed to be. Those laws are supposed to be applied equally to all, but they aren't and you damned well know it. Cops aren't supposed to be running around acting as judge, jury, and executioner like Judge Dredd--and that's why those cops present at the unjust, vile, and casually cruel murder of a human being are going to prison.",

That kind of enlightened centrism is something you have to be super delusional to achieve. \n\n\nI'm leftist and I think the extreme right wing could actually be the end of democracy. That said I could still easily mock leftist politicians and other leftist views. I mean, some are pretty laughable, even if I know where they're coming from. \n\n\n>for example, admitted that ManBearPig was in fact real\n\n\nThe right is peeling away from the whole \"It was all a hoax\" thing because global warming by now is too obvious to ignore. They're moving to the view that yes climate change real but let's not cut down on emissions or implement strident measures (because what if China won't?!!?!?) as we can't stop it anymore and it's too expensive to do anything about it. We'll technobabble our way through it (we'll go to Mars!) and in any case, this will affect mostly poor people.\n\n\nTo put it another way, they still think climate measures are dumb and probably think Nuclear + Hydrogen is going to solve everything as long as the government gets out of the free market's way.",

Like there is clearly a difference in sound between most music from the 80s and prior compared to most music released the past 20 years. If it were just about age, the music could sound very similar but you would reject it just because it's not the music you grew up with. \n\nAs for loud, edgy music, for a long time, there have been subgenres like that and not every young person in the past was into them. But I do think a higher percent of younger people tend to prefer louder, edgier music in whatever modern form it takes and as people get older, the current version of that sort of music may be hard to enjoy and seem less cool unlike what you thought when you were younger, though you may still appreciate the older stuff you were into.",

Talk to people from a range of backgrounds, including people facing marginalisation, *especially* when that marginalisation is newly recognised. Go into it without a conclusion and without trying to force them to be an encyclopedia of The Struggle for you. \n\nI'm non binary. When I came out, the concept was totally new to my dad. He approached the issue with a will to learn, good intentions, and love for his child. He wasn't perfect by any means - he inadvertently asked hurtful questions, and constantly accidentally misgendered me. But because I knew he was trying, and because he listened when I told him he'd said something hurtful, our relationship remained solid (unlike the ones between many of my trans friends and their parents). Dad saw the links between my experiences and my mum's within the women's rights movement. He read up on shit. He checked if I was in the mood for heavy topics rather than assuming I was always up for Representing the Trans Experience. \n\nAnd now? He's pretty damn solid on my pronouns. If he slips up, he corrects it. If someone is rude about/to me, he's very good at calling them out in a way that doesn't make people double down out of defensiveness.\n\nHis friends... Less so. Especially the ones without kids. They don't realise how similar their arguments are to the old '*If they didn't cause so much trouble, they'd be treated better*' or '*It's a biological fact. Women make poor employees - they'll always get pregnant and quit*'. And it so easily becomes self fulfilling. Older people who don't have that insight seek out others with similar opinions, or listen to similar media, and suddenly the only time they hear about trans people (or Black Lives Matter, or Antifa, or even the concept of enthusiastic consent) is when it's being used as clickbait or for political point scoring.",

I know that there are many people in the world who can't bear to think that someone they don't like (Trump) could be doing something clever or worth discussion (his odd persuasion techniques).  So, the whole subject started to bite into Adams other forms of income (businesses stopped wanting to pay him to speak to their executives, for example, because he became controversial).  So, I think his response to that was to become Tucker Carlson and try to milk the Right for every nickel.  He instantly became a parody of himself (I stopped watching his little videos when he decided to parrot Trump and he started making up little nicknames for the people he disagreed with).\n\nI remember at one point, he was having an online disagreement with someone about climate change and he, seemingly without irony, asked if he was supposed to have some advanced degree in math or physics or chemistry to judge the validity of scientific papers on the subject.  Something about how he already had a degree in Economics, wasn't that enough?",

But then Trump won the primaries and then there was a minor spotlight on Adams that he correctly predicted it. So he dug in and claimed, as a 'master persuader', he could identify someone skilled in persuasion. Then Trump won the general elections and by that point Adams was too deep into his delusions. He had gained a large right wing following and saw that his only way to stay relevant was to continue his dog whistling tweets.\n\nA pity really because I do think he can still be funny at times.",

They admitted to doing this. \n\nWhen Hitler was asked in 1922 why he referred to his party as socialist he said:\n\n>Socialism is the science of dealing with the common weal. Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. *I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists*. Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality, and unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.\n\nAnd of course, the two parties that he was competing against and later banned (killing members who didn't escape the country) were the socialist and communist parties.",

These policies made them somewhat popular with the working class.\n\nThey organized holyday trips for poor worker families. They created many jobs with large, government funded infrastructure projects. They supported families with many children. They designed and produced affordable cars for normal citizens. And so on.\n\nIf that had been all, I think Hitler and his party would have been assessed very differently in the history of Germany and Europe.\n\nBud sadly, there was also and much more important the nationalist stuff, with militarism, imperialism, raging antisemitism, general xenophobia, authoritarianism ... ultimately leading to war and genocide in a scale never seen before.\n\nLong story short: The socialist part of the National Socialists was not the problem. The bad part was the nationalism.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: To make it clear. I don't agree with the right wing nutjobs that want to equate Socialists with Nazis. I want to explain that even if the Nazis did borrow certain policies (and part their name) form Socialists, that doesn't make them comparable with them. The intent of the Nazis was a completely different one. Many of the seemingly socialist policies were ether a trick to lure in left leaning voters, or even more sinister, were a preparation for the war the Nazis always wanted.",

Most unions that existed in Nazi Germany were state-run unions, many capital enterprises also worked for the benefit of the state and sometimes were nationalized.

We had a surge of hammer skins back then.

Plus some pretty racist 1% biker gangs. So it ain't good.  But at least the racist skins got chased out.",

Its an ideology in opposition to fascism. You can't make statements about the \"leader of antifa\" anymore than you can the \"leader of capitalism\" or the \"leader of fascism\" because an idea doesn't have a leadership structure.\n\nThere are anti-fascist coalitions, for example Rose City ANTIFA in Portland. Or the OG, Antifaschistische Aktion in the Weimar Republic in the 20s. These would qualify as organizations. \n\nSo anyone who sees fascists and decides to take action against them is anti-fascist and thus antifa. If they group up with other like minded people and make a habit of it, then they are basically an organization, but most of them pick an actual name.",

They're not saying names are *always* wrong, they're saying that names are *sometimes* right and *sometimes* wrong, and therefore \"it's in the name\" isn't a very strong argument.  \n  \nLike, the Republic of Korea ***is*** a republic. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is ***not*** democratic. If I say \"names aren't always accurate\" that doesn't mean that I'm \"accusing South Korea of secretly not being a republic.\"",

Perhaps that's narcissistic of me, but I don't want to just be another bit in the matrix.

Intelligence is one of the most complicated things to try to talk about.\n\nIs it really so hard to believe that there are people who believe absolutely crackpot things, but you could put them in a room full of puzzles/riddles/problems and they could solve their way out?\n\nIf you think IQ tests have \"been debunked as bullshit for years now\" then I guarantee you haven't plugged into the scholarly world of IQ research. Or if you have, you are severely misrepresenting the situation in academia. Are IQ tests measuring some single, objectively deterministic intelligence factor? No, definitely not. But does anyone really think intelligence comes down to a single number? ANY attempt to reduce something complex down to a single number is going to be wrought with people complaining that the number doesn't account for this, that, or the other thing. I think this is actually best summarized by a paragraph from the actual study mentioned in the article you linked:\n\n>On the one hand, a higher-order component may be used to generate a more interpretable first-order factor solution, for example, when cognitive tasks load heavily on multiple components. On the other hand, the basis of the higher-order component is ambiguous and may be accounted for by cognitive tasks corecruiting multiple functionally dissociable brain networks. Consequently, to interpret a higher-order component as representing a dominant unitary factor is misleading.\n\nIn other words, many parts of the brain come together, doing different things, to create intelligence. A single g factor works better when many/most parts are being used. Using one number to describe \"how well\" they do this is always going to be inaccurate to SOME degree. Declaring it useless, though, is silly. It certainly indicates general academic success, among other things. Is that useless?\n\nI think IQ as a concept and IQ research are great, as long as everyone understands how it actually works and that it's not some magic number etched into the underside of your prefrontal cortex, or something.\n\nMaybe someday we'll understand all the little parts and systems individually well enough that we can come up with lots of different \"numbers\" or other metrics to give a better description of different capabilities.\n\nI also realize I didn't touch on things like the racism etc involved in the early history of IQ research. IMO, future IQ research will help solve racism by proving our similarities once more.",

First of all, there are literally hundreds of examples of people bragging online about studying for the MENSA test and consistently improving their scores. At MENSA conferences people take the test over again to improve their scores and try to one up each other. I was in Mensa for a year, 1: its weird as hell and very very uncomfortable 2: the test is primarily pattern recognition and puzzle solving, two skills that are objectively trainable in general. On top of that, the types patterns and puzzles don't change, they can be learned and you absolutely become better/quicker at spotting or solving them.\n\nI was also a \"gifted\" student in HS, I know of at least 2 kids (twins) who had a crazy mom who insisted they were gifted (they were average at best) and had them take the tests repeatedly and train for them. It turns out if you practice tangrams (which are similar to one of the puzzles that were at one point on the test used in many schools in the US) you get better at tangrams. It turns out if you practice word association drills you get better at words association. It turns out if you practice puzzles and the like you improve in those areas.\n\nYou absolutely can train for these tests if you know the specifics of the test you are taking.\n\nSide note: MENSA literally sells training manuals for their tests. It is in their financial interest to make a test that is demonstrably trainable because they WANT people to be able to improve their scores and get in. They fucking love taking money from people, and you can't collect dues from someone you reject.\n\nOn an anecdotal note my IQ came in well above that of my sister. We are both successful (I am an actuary she is an attorney) but she has always learned things quicker and easier than me. She became conversational in Arabic in 2 weeks in preparation for a trip to Morocco that was unexpected. She is fluent in and able to negotiate and write complex contracts in Mandarin, French, German, and (obviously) English. I don't think I'm dumb by any means but she is fucking brilliant. The IQ tests that exist are just inherently flawed, and they probably always will be.\n\n**EDIT:** re: your bullshit about IQ tests not relying on cultural knowledge. they objectively do. A lot of effort has gone into reducing that (for example removing sections requiring you to find hidden objects and pointing them out using specific words, not all of which are consisted across languages and cultures), but they still tend to favor people from the region where they were developed.\n\nhttps://nrcgt.uconn.edu/newsletters/winter052/\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/the-iq-test-wars-why-screening-for-intelligence-is-still-so-controversial-81428",

What test does Mensa administer in your country?\n\n> I was in Mensa for a year, 1: its weird as hell and very very uncomfortable\n\nIt is, yes. I was in Mensa as a kid. It's where I learnt why roleplaying games distinguish intelligence and wisdom ;)\n\n> You absolutely can train for these tests if you know the specifics of the test you are taking.\n\nYou can train for *one* test with limited results. This is the practice effect. There is a plethora of standardised IQ tests, with which it can be established that you can unfortunately not train to raise your general intelligence significantly. Most tests also test various not obviously related ability. Training \"tangrams\" will help you with RCPM, but less so with Stanford-Binet. This was relatively securely established in psychometrics in the early 2000s and I'm not aware of any groundbreaking refutation of this, but admittedly I haven't really kept up with the field.\n\n> your bullshit about IQ tests not relying on cultural knowledge. they objectively do\n\nYou should tell clinical practitioners world-wide, who ignorantly use tests like the WAIS-IV for psychometric assessment. But more seriously, how large do you think that effect is, and with which test? Individuals undergoing IQ tests are normally compared with a culture-specific cohort. You don't generally give an \"Amazonas Indian\" (for some reason, a lot of papers on IQ tests talked about hypothetical Amazonas Indians surviving in the jungle when I was at uni) a WAIS-test and then compare them with a Lithuanian. This is in part why I said (or meant; I see now that I phrased it awkwardly) that IQ testing is more useful when considering populations holistically, rather than trying to use them *individually*. Another issue is what you consider \"cultural knowledge\". When people say that in colloquial conversations, they usually mean actual knowledge-dependent questions. Questions like \"Morris dancer is to Morris minor as Fish and Chips is to ?\" are not really used any more in the core modules of modern IQ tests, or not at all in some. If you test people with high formal educational attainments across cultures, tests like WAIS or the aforementioned RPM are quite stable. Are these tests \"culturally sensitive\", then, or \"educationally sensitive\"? Both are an issue, but of different kinds.",

It works like an IQ test, but the tests they use desnt have any construct validity. Measuring IQ with one test that measures one skill is dumb on its face. \n\n\n> that some define to be \"genius\" level, so for certain definitions... \n\nWho defines genius this way? I've been in the field for a couple of years now and has never heard anything close to 130 being referred to as genius level. \n\n>Honestly though, it's pretty disingenuous. He's been pretty critical of Mensa members in the past.\n\nMensa is a silly group consisting of silly people caring about silly stuff. It's all very emberassing imo.",

It had a lot of stoic elements to it. \n\nThe idea that how you feel each day is mostly caused by what you eat, and other stupid things that you end up attributing to the wrong things around you, was big. I started eating healthier and working out, and realized immediately that I made better decisions. \n\nThe idea that you're going to try things a lot and fail, but that you pick up new skill each time, was also big. This is called \"fail fast\" in software engineering. His examples were that he tried to launch this business. The business didn't fail, but now he had an advertising guy for the next business. The next business failed, but now he had another business connection.\"\n\nThe other one was the idea that, you can either be in the top 95% of a field, or the top 80% of two compatible fields. It's hard to be a top artist, or a top comedian. But if you're a decent artist and decently funny, and had specific experience, you ended up with Dilbert. \n\nIt's hard for me to imagine that someone with these philosophies would be so easily duped by Trump. How could he look at Trump and think \"yeah, this guy is smart\"? I just don't get it.",

In fact, if you read the paper, you'll find that the word religion/religious never even appears in the research paper.  The paper analyzed a wide range of different things associated with brain injury during war, one of which was social behavior, however their conclusions were far from claiming brain damage causes religious fundamentalism.",

Even when I see someone with a horrible view of life or political beliefs, I immediately get scared that they have some form of brain damage and are essentially trapped in a corrupted version of their former, pleasant self. The trouble is, as a person gets older, their brain damage is compounded so a person will almost always live to see themselves become the villain, or can choose... an exit plan. Not a very positive way of thinking when I've had issues with suicidal ideation in the past, but it plays in the back of my mind. I'll often back down from basic debates, just thinking that the person could punch me and I'd essentially become a different person. It horrifies me. I get entertainment from a book that another person gets from a month long vacation, and it's essentially a cheap way to live, but I could lose that overnight if I had a stroke. I could lose my imagination and my low threshold for life satisfaction. I fucking hate that. Who would I become? Just thinking about it right now has made me nervous.",

He had a history of mental illness that ended with his suicide.\n\nSo was he racist? Absolutely. He was a product of his environment. He was born 40 years after the civil war. 19 years after the compromise of 1877. He grew up around elders that lost fathers, sons, brothers, and friends to a civil war they lost. Even without the mental illness it would have been a struggle for him to recognize the bigotry for what it was and break that cycle.\n\nEven in the north the persons of color and Asians were 3rd class citizens. (Italians and Irish being 2nd class citizens). By present day standards his views are rightfully viewed as bigoted and evil. By the standards of his days- it was evil or ignorant to elevate free men and former slaves to a white persons level.",

I think it's true of a lot of teenagers, just because that's kind of a selfish age where you're trying to figure everything out in life. It's where being \"gifted\" in school starts to meet the real world. But by the time we're 18 we pretty much realize we're not as highly intelligent as our parents had us thinking. We then, hopefully, reevaluate who we are in relation to the world.\n\nBut this dude...he never made it past that stage of being a self-righteous 14 year old.

They did so because I was performing poorly and they thought that I might have some kind of developmental issue.\n\nIt turns out that I was reading at a high school level and that I scored in the top 2% of the population. Suddenly I was The Genius Child, and every poor study habit I had was the result of me being \"bored\" (instead of, you know, not having parents that imposed any homework discipline on me).\n\nThis went *way* to my head and, for a long time, I was convinced that I knew better than anyone about everything, even as my grades started to tank in high school (where my ability to BS myself to a better grade ran in some hard realities). It really hit a nadir when I took up Libertarianism as my political identity (largely because I took Heinlein too seriously).\n\nIt took me a long time to understand that intelligence (however you measure it) isn't the same thing as wisdom. It took me until my mid-30s before I finally had myself sorted out, but I went through a lot of harm along the way because I kept being told how fucking smart I was.\n\nIt's a trap.",

Adams is a case of someone who got something unexpectedly right concluding that they're a genius.\n\nI've read the older books. They were always written with the mentality of a smarter Karl Pilkington. For example, [\"Holodecks will end the world\"](http://www.toomey.org/harold/jokes/StarTrekFuture.html) was a funny potentially-true idea, not an attempt at a real prediction. There's even a part in Dilbert Future where he goes \"Okay, now I'm going to get more serious\".\n\nBut when he got into politics, that changed. He was right about Trump getting more popular (at the time, pre-election), and a lot more people saying he's right, so he came to the conclusion that he was a genius at politics. That he wasn't just the guy with the wacky worldview, but the guy with the *right* worldview. And then it became his entire life.\n\n...Which really sucks. Because I liked his non-political books, but he's not going to do another one.",

          "text": "You are more right than you think. I wrote about this somewhere else once, so I might as well copy/paste the comment about how Scott Adams became the bizarrely nonsensical Trump supporter that he is today. So here goes:\n\nYou see, dear Scott used to have a blog on his website. And in it, he just, well, blogged away, offering his opinions on just about everything in existence. A lot of those opinions were questionable or self-serving or just plain stupid. But hey, each to his own. And then there was that one time where he gave \"hundreds of readers the orgasm of their life\" all thanks to his ingenious writing skills (no, I am not kidding. No, don't look it up if you don't want to cringe yourself into oblivion).\n\nThere was also the time where he made a bunch of alt accounts on reddit to praise himself and his blog. And when he was caught doing this, he wrote that praising himself with alt accounts only proved what a genius he truly was. Again, not kidding.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nAnother thing he did at one point was to say that climate change isn't real.\n\nHe did say so quite some years before Trump and even before climate change actually arrived (in the sense that we could directly feel it day to day). And he offered all the usual stupid arguments that aren't worth getting into here.\n\nAnd then, when climate change did become real, he offered some token resistance, and went \"yeah, whoops, I was wrong!\". Neat, right?\n\nHowever, some time later, he was writing another blog post (incidentally, the one where he wrote what a genius he was for using alt accounts praising himself) about how super smart people like himself do self-promotion.\n\nYou see, what a smart person does (according to him) is to take a public issue that is disputed, but where one side is actually 99.9% likely to be correct. Y'know, like climate change. And then you bet on the 0.01%. If you're wrong, you just admit to it and move on, no biggie. But if you are right! Oh boy! You just hit the jackpot! You just publicly stated that you believe in an incredibly unlikely thing, and the thing turned out to be true! And now you get to pat yourself on the back for being super smart all along! Hooray! In that blog post he openly admitted that he never doubted climate change is real, he just bet against it just in case he was wrong and could come out as some sort of super genius.\n\nAnd then, incidentally, he became one of the very first people of note that predicted that Donald Trump would win the presidential election. And he was right. And this was at the time when all of the media and even other conservatives openly laughed at him and his antics.\n\nAll he did was use the exact same strategy he outlined already: Pick the 0,01% chance thing and bet on it. Write long blog posts about why that thing is totally going to happen. In this case, write long blog posts about why Trump is some super smart genius that will totally win.\n\nIf Trump had lost, he would just go \"yeah I was wrong\" and bet on the next random thing. But he wasn't wrong. And so, ever since then, he has to pretend that Trump really is the genius that he claimed Trump is, just so he can keep pretending that he was always serious about Trump's chances, instead of just randomly assuming the unlikely candidate would win.\n\nAnd this, in turn, pushed him more and more towards the right, because obviously every sensible person stopped reading his blog pretty soon after. Plus, he couldn't praise Trump and denounce his politics at the same time, right? And in turn, inevitably, this pushed him more into that far right crowd, which in turn made him actually start to believe the shit these people say. Essentially, he radicalized himself.",

Woke isn't a term that describes an understanding of the history of systemic racism and how it affects black people, it's any mention of black people in media, and also Antifa, CRT, and groomers.  CRT isn't a graduate-level legal course, it's telling white kids they're racist by woke, groomer teachers and Antifa.  And Groomers aren't adults grooming kids for sexual purposes, it's Woke Antifa Gays turning kids gay with CRT and Antifa.\n\nThe words mean everything and nothing, and that's how you get dumb bullshit like Dilbert guy in the OP, or Marjorie Taylor Greene saying \"corporate communism.\"  They literally have no fucking clue what they're saying.",

Being anti-fascist then was more about being anti-capitalist than being anti-racist or anti-autorithorian like today, and nazis were not yet seen through the lenses of Holocaust and genocide as we do today. \n\nAutonomous groups revived AFA\u2019s symbols in the 70s and several European militant antifa groups today call themselves AFA instead of antifa, [at least here in Scandinavia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifascistisk_Aktion).  \n\nAntifa groups in America also use the AFA logo, so that\u2019s probably the connection he\u2019s making. The logo was also used by spanish syndicalists and partisans during the spanish civil war, so it has a rich and somewhat collective history and I wouldn\u2019t attribute it to one single group today. \n\nTo make a long story short what he is trying to say is \u201churr durr if you take everything out of context anti-racists are fascists\u201d which is of course both uneducated and dishonest. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifaschistische_Aktion\n\nEdit: SPD not SPK",

They obviously disagreed with them on a number of fronts, but figured that if Nazi's rose to power that their poor economic policy would immediately collapse the government allowing the KPD's brand of communism to step in unopposed. They just wanted the Socialist Democrat party to be destroyed and were perfectly fine with the Nazis to be the ones doing the dirty work, assuming KPD would be the ones actually on deck. Of course, Antifaschistische Aktion was primarily formed of a coalition within the KPD that was morally opposed to ALL fascism including Nazism, so it's probably not fair to say AA were pro-Nazi, but the party they belonged to had allowed Nazis to succeed in early political stages. Eventually, Hitler very much eradicated the majority of open communists, including several notable figures who had supported him early on. KPD got to grow into their own brand of bs in east Germany, post WWII, so AA as such dissolved over there and West Germany student movements adopted it for themselves in the early 50's. Most of Antifa today has no real direct lineage to the KPD except for having reclaimed the name/symbols... you know since most of the OG KPD were dead or locked behind the iron curtain.\n\nIt's a real REAL stretch to say Antifa was \"allied with Hitler\" but in at least one sense, a group of people with a similar name were associated with a political party that strategically allowed Nazis to come to power... but nuance is often lost in ad-hitlerum.",

Modern Antifa is nothing like that, but Antifa DID help the Nazis rise to power. As did Communists. People should really know this stuff...\n\nKPD leader Ernst Th\u00e4lmann declared that \"some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest [of social democrats]\".[27] In February 1932, Th\u00e4lmann argued that \u201cHitler must come to power first, then the requirements for a revolutionary crisis [will] arrive more quickly\u201d.

KPD were the official communist political party, that yes they strategically allowed Nazism to grow in strength in 30's with the thought that Nazis would inevitably fail, leaving the KPD to take over. Antifaschistische Aktion, on the other hand, were a loose political movement of primarily KPD members that opposed fascism completely and   \n were outspoken against Nazism. AA eventually gained enough influence within the party to course correct the KPD... too little too late. \n\nFWIW Thaelmann ran for president under the slogan \"A vote for Hindenburg (SDP) is a vote for Hitler; a vote for Hitler is a vote for war.\" He was eventually imprisoned  by Hitler and killed on his orders after attempting to organize a violent government overthrow with the SDP. \n\nSo yeah... KPD made some dumb choices. The party leader tried to play the game and got burned, well tortured, shot then burned. That leader DID form the predecessor of Antifa, as well, but at no point is there evidence of the AA directly assisting Nazi's and that same guy died fighting against them after fucking up royally.",

Here\u2019s why that\u2019s wrong:\n\n* This was a referendum to dissolve the parliament. Not to abolish the body entirely, just to clear it out and trigger new elections, which is not and abnormal thing, though usually triggered by legislators not a public referendum. (I didn\u2019t read enough to pretend to understand the exact KPD motivations, but presumably they thought they would gain seats and either force the SPD into coalition with them or at least get some concessions?)\n\n* This just wasn\u2019t that important, because of the above point, and frankly because it was just one parliament of one state (free state of Prussia) not even the Reichstag.\n\n* Encouraging KPD members to vote for one referendum does not a red-brown alliance make. The same conditions that are electorally advantageous for communists also give rise to fascists. The alignment here is that both had something to gain by calling elections at that particular moment, not any ideological agreement.\n\n* Dissolving the parliament would not have given power to the NSDAP as far as I can tell.\n\n* And finally, the referendum failed to pass by four or so million votes.\n\nOn the KPD/SPD relations being sour, if the SPD wanted to be on good terms with the KPD they could if they wanted and have formed a government with them. Instead the SPD hated communism more than it did liberalism and repeatedly formed coalitions with liberals, showing themselves an enemy of the workers of Germany again and again.",

Microsoft bought him out for **two and a half** ***BILLION*** **dollars**... and Notch then apparently decided to spend his time being a general-purpose dickhead online. I mean, like, Elon Musk loves shouting dumb shit on the Internet too, but he's also actually involved with his car and space companies, which are doing impressive things. Notch could at least be buying steam locomotives and crashing them together in the desert for his own amusement. Or setting up his own Squid Game. Hmm. Actually, Notch and Musk and Bezos and Gates may really be doing that last thing. That wouldn't surprise me at all. :-)\n\n(Edit: [Tom from Myspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Anderson) \"only\" came into **half** a billion dollars.

Then he's referring to the KPD's uncompromising attitude towards the Social Democrats which prevented an anti-Nazi coalition government. \n\n> The 1930 election left the Social Democrats and KPD with almost 40 per cent of the seats in the Reichstag between them. In November 1931, the SPD suggested the two parties work together but Th\u00e4lmann rejected the offer, with the KPD newspaper The Red Flag calling for an \u201cintensification of the fight against Social Democracy\u201d. Addressing the Nazi electoral breakthrough in the 1930 elections, Th\u00e4lmann insisted that if Hitler came to power he was sure to fail and drive Nazi voters into the arms of the KPD. As late as February 1932, Th\u00e4lmann was arguing that \u201cHitler must come to power first, then the requirements for a revolutionary crisis [will] arrive more quickly\u201d\n\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_German_federal_election#Aftermath",

They named themselves Antifa in memory of this idea.\n\nI think that's were your misconception is... The actual group which 99% people talk about (at least right now) is NOT the German Antifa that started on the 70 as you're thinking.. \n\nThey're talking about the US antifa. Which is actually very recently formed group and has the same ideological roots of the German Antifa (which also come from Antifaschistische Aktion) but actually is NOT the same group of the Gemany Antifa...\n\nGerman Antifa is a centralized and organized group while American Antifa is a large amount of sepparate groups under the same flag, but none of those groups are the German Antifa.\n\nI recommend you read a little a bit the subject if you're intesterested ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa_(United_States) ). I understand that you probably never heard any of that in Germany school but that's because when you went to school American antifa probably didn't exist yet.\n\n\nSo yeah... Turns out history continues happening after we leave school, so you can't base your entire worldview on what you learned there and think you're above wikipedia.\n\nI hope now you get why no one understood your \"joke\".",

                      "text": ">During the Third Period, the KPD viewed the Nazi Party ambiguously. On one hand, the KPD considered the Nazi Party to be one of the fascist parties. On the other hand, the KPD sought to appeal to the Strasserite-wing of the Nazi movement by using nationalist slogans. The KPD sometimes cooperated with the Nazis in attacking the SPD. In 1931, the KPD had united with the Nazis, whom they referred to as \"working people's comrades\", in an unsuccessful attempt to bring down the SPD state government of Prussia by means of a referendum. In the usage of the Soviet Union, and of the Comintern and its affiliated parties in this period, including the KPD, the epithet fascist was used to describe capitalist society in general and virtually any anti-Soviet or anti-Stalinist activity or opinion.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifaschistische\\_Aktion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifaschistische_Aktion)\n\nThe KDP page has more info.\n\n>The KPD leadership initially first criticised but then supported the 1931 Prussian Landtag referendum, an unsuccessful attempt launched by the far-right Stahlhelm to bring down the social democrat state government of Prussia by means of a plebiscite; the KPD referred to the SA as \"working people's comrades\" during this campaign.\\[26\\] During the joint KPD and Nazi campaign to dissolve the Prussian Parliament, Berlin Police captains Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck were assassinated in B\u00fclowplatz by Erich Mielke and Erich Ziemer, who were members of the KPD's paramilitary wing, the Parteiselbstschutz. The detailed planning for the murders had been carried out by KPD members of the Reichstag, Heinz Neumann and Hans Kippenberger, based on orders issued by Walter Ulbricht, the Party's leader in the Berlin-Brandenberg region. Shooter Erich Mielke who later became the head of the East German Stasi, would only face trial for the murders in 1993.\\[citation needed\\]\n\n>The KPD maintained a solid electoral performance, usually polling more than 10% of the vote. It gained 100 deputies in the November 1932 elections, getting 16% of the vote and coming third.\\[10\\] In the presidential election of the same year, its candidate Th\u00e4lmann took 13.2% of the vote, compared to Hitler's 30.1%. In this period, while also opposed to the Nazis, the KPD regarded the Nazi Party as a less sophisticated and thus less dangerous fascist party than the SPD, and KPD leader Ernst Th\u00e4lmann declared that \"some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest \\[of social democrats\\]\".\\[27\\] In February 1932, Th\u00e4lmann argued that \u201cHitler must come to power first, then the requirements for a revolutionary crisis \\[will\\] arrive more quickly\u201d. In November 1932, the KPD and the Nazis worked together in the Berlin transport workers\u2019 strike.\\[9\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist\\_Party\\_of\\_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany)\n\nHere's another good read if you want to understand the prevailing mentality at the time.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\\_fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fascism)\n\nNote that its only after the alliance of Italy and Germany and especially the war, that the association between Nazism and the word \"fascism,\" coined and practiced by Mussolini, became inherently intertwined to the point where Hitler is the dominating image when thinking about fascism. Hitler was inspired by Mussolini but also had many diverging ideas from him gathered from other places.",

Even Rachele Mussolini donated her wedding ring. The collected gold was melted down and turned into gold bars, which were then distributed to the national banks.\n\nGovernment control of business was part of Mussolini's policy planning. By 1935, he claimed that three-quarters of Italian businesses were under state control. Later that year, Mussolini issued several edicts to further control the economy, e.g. forcing banks, businesses, and private citizens to surrender all foreign-issued stock and bond holdings to the Bank of Italy. In 1936, he imposed price controls.[109] He also attempted to turn Italy into a self-sufficient autarky, instituting high barriers on trade with most countries except Germany.\n\nIn 1943, Mussolini proposed the theory of economic socialization.\n\n\nSo you were lying",

Communism is not Socialism. Marxism is not Socialism. The Marxians have stolen the term and confused its meaning. I shall take Socialism away from the Socialists.\n\n\u2018Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality and, unlike Marxism, it is patriotic.\n\n\u2018We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our Socialism is national. We demand the fulfilment of the just claims of the productive classes by the State on the basis of race solidarity. To us, State and race are one\u2026",

If there were ever a societal upheaval, I would not fare well. My wife and I tried going meatless for a while; it wasn't horrible but it was a bit dull. One way to offset that is with sweetness and saltiness, both of which bring their own health concerns to the table. Not that a meat-centric diet completely avoids those concerns.\n\nBut I'm also not one to go bananas at the thought of having steaks on the regular. Maybe a tenderloin once in a blue moon. But a salmon filet on a bed of couscous, at least the way my wife makes it, is amazing.\n\nI do love my starches, though. Rice, potatoes, pasta.",

If you grew up in the times when phones only had buttons 0-9 with letters on them, it was done to save a significant amount of time because a few letters actually took a non-negligible amount of time to type. If you grew up with the internet, it's possible that it's a habit you picked up from gaming. If youre playing a game and have to communicate in chat at the same time, saving letters actually does save a significant amount of time for the activity youre partaking in. this is called \"leet speak\". Here things like ur, abt, ty, etc. are extremely common and they carry over into the text written on webistes like reddit with informal communication as 95% of people can understand what these short hands mean (actually youre the first who ive says that claims they dont).\n\nId also suggest you dont make assumptions about peoples english as it may be (in my case is) their second language and learning a new language is never easy. If you do or dont speak a second language id keep my criticism to myself unless its in some way helpful. \n\nI dont know why you felt the need to come in and be hostile based on what you think my political views might be based on me saying \"i am centre right\".

      "text": "'Allied' is maybe too strong a term, but he's broadly right.\n\nThe first incarnation of Antifa began in the early 1930s as a paramilitary wing of the German Communist Party (KPD). The KPD regarded the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) as its main rival, ostensibly because all capitalists were fascists, but really because they were worried that if the center-left actually made things better then no one would support a communist revolution. This was all, by the way, at the direction of Stalin, whose lead many communist groups throughout Europe followed as part of communism's internationalist ideology.\n\nWhile Antifa was still fundamentally opposed to Nazism, they viewed the Nazis as a minor problem compared to the SDP (the more insidious brand of \"fascism\"). In fact they viewed a Nazi government as a good thing as it would inevitably collapse and open the door for a communist takeover.\n\nSo there was a significant amount of cooperation between Antifa and the Nazis, both in attacking SPD supporters and in trying to bring down the Weimar government. The KPD even referred to the Nazis as 'comrades of the working people' during the attempt to unseat the SDP government of Prussia in a referendum. Of course, behind the rhetoric both sides still hated each other, so there were plenty of skirmishes between Antifa members and Nazis on the street. But it's not at all wrong to say that Antifa cooperated with the Nazis and helped bring them to power.\n\nOh, and - spoiler alert - the Nazi goverment didn't immediately implode and let the KPD and their Antifa footsoldiers take the reins of the German government in the ensuing chaos. Instead the Nazis crushed the German communists and they all ended up in concentration camps (or in exile. Or, hilariously, in exile and then in a Soviet gulag). So yeah, the whole 4D chess thing didn't quite work out for them.",

While also opposed to the Nazis, the KPD regarded the Nazi Party as a less sophisticated and thus less dangerous fascist party than the SPD. In December 1931, KPD leader Ernst Th\u00e4lmann declared that \"some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest\" of the SPD. In 1931, the KPD under the leadership of Ernst Th\u00e4lmann internally used the slogan \"After Hitler, our turn!\", strongly believing that a united front against Nazis was not needed and that a Nazi dictatorship would ultimately crumble due to flawed economic policies and lead the KPD to power in Germany when the people realised that their economic policies were superior.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany?wprov=sfti1\n\nIn 1932, as the party began to shift focus to the fascist threat, the KPD founded the Antifaschistische Aktion, commonly known as Antifa, which it described as a \"red united front under the leadership of the only anti-fascist party, the KPD\".",

(mind you, commercial rent, which is nuts in most of la county) nobody lives in the home. no foul.        \n\n- **the recent lawsuit alleging a key executive siphoned $10 million.** however, no verdict in this case yet, nothing more than the claim itself. and even if it's true, his actions are unlikely to represent the organization itself, unless everyone was in on it/enabled him, which is rather unlikely.         \n\nam i missing something essential?",

Why is the original idiot not burdened with the perils of proof? You have things back to front. We, for the most part, don't take absurd claims as fact without something to back it up. \n\nExample: I am next in line to the throne of the United Kingdom. \n\nThat isn't true. But if it was, it would be up to me to prove it. The responsibility would not lie on someone else saying \"I know the king of England. I've dined with the king of England. And you sir, are not the king of England.\" Because of course it wouldn't, that would be weird, everyone could just claim whatever they wanted, regardless of how batshit crazy and unlikely it is. Allow me to demonstrate with my farewell:\n\nI'm Elon Musk, signing off the internet forever so I can go and pay my taxes and grow the fuck up at last.",

You see how it works clearly. \n\nI will admit I'm just as guilty as any of citing things, but I've realized it's for my own benefit more than that of discourse, I can get caught in the frame as well. \n\nAnd as long as you're playing in their house, they make the rules, you're defending a stance, no matter how factual, that has already validated Thiers.  \n\nThe best way to respond is to destroy the frame, point it out. I need a lot of work on this because it's infuriating and you want to grab it. But that's how it goes absolutely nowhere. I'll probably just do it more today even. It's a brilliant tactic even if destructive as hell.\n\nI suppose the best response to this in that light is to flip the burden\n\n\"Why are you making clearly false statements about this?\"\n\nThey then are put back to defending their stance and you don't bite the hook. \n\nFuck, I need to take my own advice more.",

This was based on the theory of social fascism that had been proclaimed by Joseph Stalin\u00a0and that was supported by the Comintern\u00a0during the late 1920s and early 1930s, which held that social democracy was a variant of fascism. Consequently, the KPD held that it was \"the only anti-fascist party\" in Germany and stated that \"fighting fascism means fighting the SPD just as much as it means fighting Hitler and the parties of Br\u00fcning.\" In KPD and Soviet usage, fascism was primarily viewed as the final stage of capitalism rather than a specific group or movement such as the Italian Fascists or the German Nazis and, based on this theory, the term was applied quite broadly.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifaschistische_Aktion#Background)",

What\u2019s true is that there was a movement called \u201cAntifascist\u201d, and members of that group teamed up with some of the Nazis, and parts of this group inspired the modern Antifa movement. \n\nAntifascistische Aktion as it was called was a coalition of socialist and communist parties specifically against Fascism. The main party, the Communist party (KPD), briefly teamed up with the Nazis in 1931 to abolish the Landtag (Parliament) of Prussia. There were also some non Communist Socialists mixed in, but in effect it basically was an arm of the KPD. \n\nBut what was fascism to them? Fascism was capitalism and liberal democracy. Any party that supported either of these points was dubbed Fascist. The Nazis were correctly dubbed Fascists through this, because they practiced state-run capitalism, but were a-ok with the authoritarianism. \n\nHowever there was a branch of Nazism that was acceptable to the Antifascists, they were called Strasserists. These people were actually Socialists instead of saying they were socialists but not actually being Socialists. Don\u2019t worry, they were pieces of s*** as well, loved persecuting Jews and other minority groups. This was a minority group that was purged from the majority, with their leaders Otto and Gregor Strasser splitting from the Nazi Party and dying during Night of Long Knives respectively. These were the Nazis that some Antifascists wanted to work with. They worked together against the Social Democrats (SPD) who the KPD foolishly thought were the worse Fascists (socialist but very big fans of liberal democracy).\n\nThis Antifascist front reemerged after WW2, and combined with various German Nazi opposition groups, notably the liberal democrats and antifascist Christians. They retained their symbols and hatred of Fascism, but ditched the hatred for liberal democracy. This is the group that inspired the international Antifa movements.\n\nThis guy is framing it like the modern Antifa would be buddy-buddy with Hitler, when in reality this was a vastly different organization and the organization he is thinking of was still very against Hitler. It\u2019s like saying that the Republican party in the US is the same party of Abraham Lincoln, they\u2019re vastly different organizations.",

IT'S RIGHT THERE IN THE NAME! SOCIALISTS ARE THE REAL NAZIS!\"\n\nAnd the name does come from the fact that there were socialists in the party: Before its rise to power, it formed as an alliance between nationalists and (some) socialists, hence the \"National Socialist\" party.\n\nUnfortunately, Pointy Haired Cartoonist and other Pointy Haired Right Wingers stop right there in their analysis and their understanding, which means that they never get to the point where, soon after the Nazis *did* come to power, the nationalists [murdered the socialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_of_the_Long_Knives). Socialism was thereafter insignificant in the party.\n\nThis is not to excuse the socialists who were at that earliest time part of the Nazis. They were assholes who were dancing with the Devil, not innocent pawns. But reality is a far step away from the \"Socialism is Nazism\" claims of the Pointy Haired.",

The leader of the German communist party even explicitly said \"After Hitler, us\", thinking that a nazi government would somehow be more likely than a liberal government to bring about his \"revolution\". He of course was sent to, and died in, a concentration camp during the war. If the communists and liberals in Germany presented a more united front against the nazis, its possible they could have been prevented from taking powrt.\n\nKind of a stretch to claim from this that modern day antifa in the US is pro-nazi, but it is objectively true that the far left have collaborated with the far right in multiple instances in the past when they thought it would help them disrupt the status quo.\n\nOne big takeaway is that one of the dangerous claims that the far left make is that centrist or even center-left elements are equivalent to or even worse than actual fascists. R/shitliberalssay is basically an entire subreddit dedicated to this with 100K+ subs.\n\nThe first poster doesn'r really know what he's talking about but I don't think the sanctimonious tone of the second one is called for considering the claim isn't entirely false.",

There\u2019s some pictures of their headquarters building in Berlin from 1930 and all of the iconography is present in the form it is used today. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Paul_Anlauf_and_Franz_Lenck\n\nKPD joined with the Nazis to oppose the majority Social Democratic Party parliament. \u201cAntifa\u201d was originally used by the KPD to say \u201ceveryone outside of KPD is facist, therefore we are the only Antifa, despite SDP also being followers of the teachings of Marx.\n\nIn short, I think the name and iconography of Antifa was intentionally introduced by Russian operatives decades ago to spark division by getting liberals to adopt so that conservatives can claim that \u201cAntifa actually helped the Nazis!\u201d",

The NSDAP still had different, partly competing, political wings. That stopped being a thing after the inner-party purge putting all the power in Hitler's hands. \n\n> Regardless, it has little relation to the current iteration of Antifa which is definitely absolutely anti-Nazi.\n\nThe current iteration of Antifa is just as anti-fascist as past iterations, starting with the very first one in Italy in the 1920s in response to Mussolini's fascism but also spanning to modern-day neo-Nazism, as those are all forms of fascism.",

Consequently, true pacification requires the withdrawal of tolerance before the deed, at the stage of communication in word, print, and picture. Such extreme suspension of the right of free speech and free assembly is indeed justified only if the whole of society is in extreme danger. I maintain that our society is in such an emergency situation, and that it has become the normal state of affairs.\n\nIn the shortest description, then, \u201cantifascism\u201d means anarchist mayhem with the nominal goal of effecting \u201cliberation from oppression,\u201d where \u201coppression\u201d is defined in the most expansive and preposterous way possible. That is, \u201cantifascism\u201d in radical theory\n\nanti-society-ism. It sees one of its major goals as exposing the alleged \u201cfalse consciousness\u201d of people who don\u2019t realize how oppressive their society is and giving them, instead, a \u201ccritical consciousness\u201d by which they can see it and want to overthrow their own societies.\n\n\n\nStraight from the \"handbook\"\n\nPalingenetic ultranationalism is a concept concerning generic fascism formulated by British political theorist Roger Griffin. The key element of the idea is the belief that fascism can be defined by its core myth, namely that of revolution to achieve a \"national rebirth\", palingenesis.\n\nNamely that of revolution to achieve \"national rebirth\"\n\n\nIt fits quite nicely\n\nThe anti fascist have become the very thing they preach against. The very core that \"handbook\" is to fight fascism with fascism. Yeah that makes alot sense. And it's totally not fascist. \n\nhttps://newdiscourses.com/tftw-antifascism/",

The idea that anarchism = chaos shows a dramatic lack of political science knowledge.\n\nAntifascism is one thing, against fascism. It is against the right-wing ideology that venerates tradition, family, and church and that seeks to stratify society into a series of hierarchies.\n\nIt's not \"national rebirth\", because the end result would mean the end of nations.\n\nMarxist and anarchist thought are both largely globalist positions. They are inherently the reverse of nationalism.\n\nNow, does antifa sometimes act authoritarian? Sure, but authoritarianism isn't a synonym for fascism. Fascism is a specific type of right wing, nationalist authoritarianism.\n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with authoritarianism. Technocracy, for example. The unintelligent are the source of all evil (See Bonhoeffer's Theory of Stupidity) and so any government system that represses the unintelligent is positive, even if it is authoritarian.",

The original Antifa back in the Weimar Republic, was started by the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) who did ally themselves with the nazis in order to fight the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) who they considered at the time to be a bigger threat and bigger fascists. Had they allied with the socialists against the nazis, they would never have risen to power, or hell, had they just stayed out of the fight the socialists would have won and the nazis would never have risen to power. So while Antifa and KPD did oppose the nazi party in principle, they DID still actually ally themselves with them, an alliance that directly lead to the nazis taking control of the country. So he is sort of correct, even though he's implying there was any sort of agreement of ideas which isn't true at all, and I don't believe for a second that James Fell isn't fully aware of this since it's well known history.",

So I would not say that it's completely unrelated. But certainly, it's not the same groups exactly, but by adopting the originals slogans and imagery, you should ofc be aware of, and you're going to be assumed to support the original. Otherwise you could argue that someone wearing a swastika today shouldn't be assumed to be a nazi because hey, they're a totally different person than the people wearing swastikas in the 30s. It doesn't work that way. When you adopt an existing group identity, you ARE assuming the role that comes with that, and that includes that antifa did in fact ally themselves with the nazis in order to fight socialists. Not because they agreed with the nazis, but because they believed the socialists to be bigger fascists because they were \"hiding their fascist identity\" (basically an enemy you know is far less dangerous than the enemy you don't know kind of argument).",

The name and imagery make sense because the ideals of the groups align, but a social movement would never have to make hard choices which tug against their ideals, because they aren't that type of cog in the process.\n\nIt sounds like you and I are generally on the same page, so let's not get caught in semantics imo",

It's not like those believing they should be fought physically as well as politically suddenly left the KPD or anything. Antifa was quite literally acting as the KPD's militant wing in the same way that the SA was the nazis militant wing. You can't honestly claim there's somehow a difference between the KPD and the antifa, while saying there isn't one between SA and the NSDAP. That would just be plain special pleading.",

On the other hand, the KPD sought to appeal to the Strasserite-wing of the Nazi movement by using nationalist slogans.[6] The KPD sometimes cooperated with the Nazis in attacking the SPD.[25] In 1931, the KPD had united with the Nazis, whom they referred to as \"working people's comrades\", in an unsuccessful attempt to bring down the SPD state government of Prussia by means of a referendum.[26] In the usage of the Soviet Union, and of the Comintern and its affiliated parties in this period, including the KPD, the epithet fascist was used to describe capitalist society in general and virtually any anti-Soviet or anti-Stalinist activity or opinion.\n\nso yes, you are right, but also they cooperated and worked with the nazis too. so dilbert creators point stands. try again",

The antifascist doktrin was however part of many left winged organisation's and developed after 1920 with the rise of the fascist in Italy. In Germany the main anti fascist movements were found in the kpd and spd and both parties were opposed to the nsdap and never kollaborated with them. So there was no antifa collaborating with the fascists, that is literally against their very definition. You probably got confused with Mussolini starting out in the Italian psi, the socialist party but after 1914 when he was removed from his position inside the party he made a turn right. But that was before there was even fascism so there was obviously no antifa atm",

      "text": "Damn seems some of yall can use a history lesson. This thread itself is r/confidentlyincorrect. Antifaschistische Aktion was the militant wing of the KPD, the German Communist Party. While the direct involvement of the wing itself may be denied, the KPD leadership 100% worked with the Nazis largely until Hitler started hanging them. \n\n\n>During the Third Period, the KPD viewed the Nazi Party ambiguously. On one hand, the KPD considered the Nazi Party to be one of the fascist parties. On the other hand, the KPD sought to appeal to the Strasserite-wing of the Nazi movement by using nationalist slogans. The KPD sometimes cooperated with the Nazis in attacking the SPD. In 1931, the KPD had united with the Nazis, whom they referred to as \"working people's comrades\", in an unsuccessful attempt to bring down the SPD state government of Prussia by means of a referendum. In the usage of the Soviet Union, and of the Comintern and its affiliated parties in this period, including the KPD, the epithet fascist was used to describe capitalist society in general and virtually any anti-Soviet or anti-Stalinist activity or opinion.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifaschistische\\_Aktion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifaschistische_Aktion)\n\nThe KDP page has more info.\n\n>The KPD leadership initially first criticised but then supported the 1931 Prussian Landtag referendum, an unsuccessful attempt launched by the far-right Stahlhelm to bring down the social democrat state government of Prussia by means of a plebiscite; the KPD referred to the SA as \"working people's comrades\" during this campaign.\\[26\\] During the joint KPD and Nazi campaign to dissolve the Prussian Parliament, Berlin Police captains Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck were assassinated in B\u00fclowplatz by Erich Mielke and Erich Ziemer, who were members of the KPD's paramilitary wing, the Parteiselbstschutz. The detailed planning for the murders had been carried out by KPD members of the Reichstag, Heinz Neumann and Hans Kippenberger, based on orders issued by Walter Ulbricht, the Party's leader in the Berlin-Brandenberg region. Shooter Erich Mielke who later became the head of the East German Stasi, would only face trial for the murders in 1993.\\[citation needed\\]\n\n>The KPD maintained a solid electoral performance, usually polling more than 10% of the vote. It gained 100 deputies in the November 1932 elections, getting 16% of the vote and coming third.\\[10\\] In the presidential election of the same year, its candidate Th\u00e4lmann took 13.2% of the vote, compared to Hitler's 30.1%. In this period, while also opposed to the Nazis, the KPD regarded the Nazi Party as a less sophisticated and thus less dangerous fascist party than the SPD, and KPD leader Ernst Th\u00e4lmann declared that \"some Nazi trees must not be allowed to overshadow a forest \\[of social democrats\\]\".\\[27\\] In February 1932, Th\u00e4lmann argued that \u201cHitler must come to power first, then the requirements for a revolutionary crisis \\[will\\] arrive more quickly\u201d. In November 1932, the KPD and the Nazis worked together in the Berlin transport workers\u2019 strike.\\[9\\]\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist\\_Party\\_of\\_Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Germany)\n\nHere's another good read if you want to understand the prevailing mentality at the time.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\\_fascism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_fascism)",
