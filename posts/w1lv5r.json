  "text": "My girlfriend cries herself to sleep some nights because she's convinced I'm going to hell for not believing in God.\nMy girlfriend grew up in a deeply religious Pentecostal household (she speaks in tongues and everything). This gave her a really warped view of reality. \n\nShe thinks Evolution is \"just a theory\" and the earth is 10,000 years old for example. Which is fine because those things don't affect our everyday lives. But recently she's been having tear-filled conversations with me about going to hell when I die. I've even heard her crying in bed after some of these conversations. \n\n\nHas anyone here dealt with anything like this? What am I supposed to do here?",

                                  "text": "> Christians have for the most part always been anti abortion\n\nUp until the early 80s, the majority opinion among evangelicals, like southern baptists, was support for full abortion rights.\n\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) is the single largest organization of evangelicals in the USA.  They have roughly 15 million members and 45,000 churches.  In 1971, before *Roe* fully legalized abortion, the SBC officially called for legislation supporting full abortion rights.  Even today, it is [still on their website:](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/resolution-on-abortion-2/)\n\n> *we call upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.*\n\n\nAnd when Roe was decided, the Baptist Press (the national newswire of the southern baptists) [said:](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/baptist-press-initial-reporting-on-roe-v-wade/)\n\n> *Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.*\n\nThey also said:\n\n>  **Question:** Was this a Warren type or \u201cliberal\u201d Supreme Court that rendered the decision?\n\n> **Answer:** No. This was a \u201cstrict constructionist\u201d court, most of whose members have been appointed by President Nixon. \n\nEven as late as [1978](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/resolution-on-abortion-5/) their official position was that government should keep its nose out of a lady's business, reiterating [their resolution from 1977:](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/resolution-on-abortion-4/)\n\n> we also affirm our conviction about the limited role of government in dealing with matters relating to abortion, and support the right of expectant mothers to the full range of medical services and personal counseling for the preservation of life and health.\n\nThe lead attorney on *Roe* was a [devout Southern Baptist](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/roe-v-wades-secret-heroine-tells-her-story) and her [2nd chair](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/weddington-sarah-r-1945)  was a  methodist preacher's daughter too.\n\nEvangelicals used to talk about \"the breath of life\" and cite Genesis where God only puts a soul into the body of Adam once its fully formed and able to breathe.  The idea is that if a child isn't capable of breathing on its own, it doesn't have a soul yet:\n\n* *And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.*  \n(Genesis 2:7)",

Most women can pick up on what you're asking anyway during that conversation and understand the anxiety about it (since they probably have that anxiety as well). \n\nThat said. The demographic that is pro-choice and also would carry an accidental baby to term is such a small slice of the population.

He told me pretty early on in our relationship that he was. We've been together for 15 years and have 3 kids. I have deconverted since and it was honestly great to have him by my side to help me through it. He never tried to push me away from religion, but was there to answer questions I had. Now don't get me wrong most relationships probably won't survive this, but it has happened and I hate seeing people telling others they should just run away, I see it all the time one here. We had the conversation about our kids when I was religious and had an understanding that I wanted to take them to church and he said that's fine, but he would not pretend for them and if they ask him questions he would tell them what he knows from the science side of things. So I guess why I'm commenting on here is to say that not all relationships like this fail. And if she ever comes out of the brainwashed religious belief she is in, that it might be helpful to have him there for her, if he's willing to be. I'm so grateful to have my husband to help me understand things. It has opened my eyes so much.",

You can keep pulling the lever on the slot machine if you want, but it's not a great financial plan.  \n\nFrom what I can gather from your situation, your partner wansnt that particularly against religion and maybe you weren't THAT religious.  Ops girlfriend is crying herself to sleep with fear of religious consequences.  That is pretty far down the rabbit hole.  \n\nJust for the record, I was raised without anything, my wife was, but she wasn't what I would call strongly religious.  Her heart wasn't in it.  I wouldn't have stayed with her had she insisted (on her parents urging) to raise the kids with whatever churchy stuff they do.  Thankfully she doesn't take part in any of that anymore and realized it's all a cult.  But like I said, she wasn't one to pray or have that nonsense in her daily thoughts.  \n\nIt really depends.  Can it work out, sure, but your example reinforces it, with something that foundational, it wouldn't work without one of them changing.  For me, changing was as much of an impossibility as believing in unicorns.  So you have to count on this other person being deprogrammed.  It's up to him to decide if it's a) possible and b) worth it.  For me that answer is almost universally no.  Only reason mine worked is I really didn't have to deprogram.  My ultimatum with the kids question did it.",

We brought up the children talk because it's important to know how we are going to handle that \n\nOur decision was i don't want to push my beliefs onto our kids nor does my soon to be wife want to shovel religion down their throats like a lot of Christians out there. (From personal experience) so instead we have a plan. I will allow my fiancee to take our kids to church until they are old enough to decide for themselves if they no longer want to go. My thing is I think churches are often times great ways for communities to come together. You know fellowship and all. But I certainly also believe once a kid is 8-12 they are able to make minor decisions like whether they want to go to church should they ever have questiond about life we can offer our kids different perspectives which I think will be really useful. \n\nAnyway that's our talk hopefully it helps in some way OP",

You can go behind your partners back as much as possible, but that leads to strife in the relationship and isn't a good example for the kids. You can divorce, but that is probably less than ideal for the kids(unless you just fight all the time anyway) and doesn't protect the kids from it anyway.",

I find many religions to enforce positive life lessons through fictional tales,which honestly I do with my kids through Aesop's fables and Grimms fairy tales, but I have definitely emphasized that morality is not based on religious viewpoints, and that many people rely on their beliefs in order to manage the concept of mortality, which is honestly none of my business nor anyone else's if someone approaches the topic through belief. I don't see anything wrong with simply respecting someone's personal choices; I'm not going to be militant about it or ever tell them to disrespect another human being. Those who I have spoken to who have changes their understanding of their own faith and even political affiliation have done so due to conversation and questioning, not with someone yelling or disrespecting them. What I do tell them, however, is that while we respect other people's belief, those who preach hate or judgement or tell you they have the right answer are the ones you should ignore, because that stems from insecurity and fear. To those people I say walk the other way, because they feed on controversy. I relay that those people aren't the way they are because of religion (although it doesn't help), that those are sad lonely people looking for answers just like everyone else, and without religion they would still find a way to preach hate. Through religion they have a justification to preach hate rather than find a way to connect and sympathize with those they don't know or understand.",

I had some other shit happen in the few years before, and those were the last blows I needed to ditch religion.\n\nShe, on the other hand, became way more religious after her psychosis. First exploring eastern religions and weird modern shit, then springing back to fundamentalism. When covid hit, she became heavily involved with a church that staged a lot of protests, and got involved with a lot of likeminded people. Both of our opinions on other matters, already drifting away, we're also pushed further in opposite directions. That period was really rough for us as we tried to navigate respecting each other while having such different beliefs on everything.\n\nYes, I'm honest with my kids, I don't go into details because none of them are really at an age I feel it's appropriate, but I will at some point. It was tough deciding whether to be honest. Me telling them meant the rest of my extended family will eventually find out, which will be awkward as hell and probably devastating for my mom. But I didn't want them to find out as adults and feel like they grew up with me living a lie.\n\nPressured might be the wrong word, but something like that. They go to church with her most Sundays, but she does not protest if they want to stay home with me. Most of their friends are Christians, and the one who is school age goes to a Christian school. This was a compromise, as my wife wanted to homeschool(both of us were homeschooled) and I thought a Christian school would be better than that at least.",

There is choice and consequence for everything you do in life. I think abortion should be mostly illegal but with some exceptions (killing you etc) so it should be case by case not irresponsible people that simply want to say my body my choice. Men have no reproductive rights at all compared to women who can choose to leave parenthood aka abortion, up for adaption etc or keep the baby. The male can only pay for that child support for up to 18 years or go to jail no if and buts. If we want equality than change the double standards.",

                                  "text": "Idk man. 16 year olds can get pregnant. Not allowed to drink yet, not allowed to drive a car. Not even old enough to go to jail. Why? Because kids are young, kids are stupid, they make mistakes. Should such a mistake, like unprotected sex, really uproot your whole life? Should a 16 year old be trusted with such responsibility? Are they financially stable enough to support a child even? Would the kid even be happy in that enviroment? And it doesn't stop there. A pregnancy will essentially ruin your whole body. I think no mistake should be as lifechanging as a forced pregnancy would be. Even if you commit manslaughter (killing someone by accident) you would only get 6 - 12 months prison time. A kid is punishment for life for possibly having unprotected sex once.\n\nOf course there are also people who get abortions on a regular basis. But you can't allow only some people to get abortions. That's just not how laws work. If you wanna look at it case by case it would take way too long. It might be too late for an abortion then. I would rather have everyone to be able to get abortions and also giving that right to \"the wrong people\" than making it illegal for everyone and essentially punishing everyone. In fact I especially wouldn't want people who are unresponsible enough to not practice safe sex and get an abortion multiple times to raise kids. \n\nI think abortions are a neccesary evil. They need to be legal because when has that ever stopped anyone? People will just get them on the blackmarket from a shady doctor in a backalley. Or perform them themselves, either with a coathanger or by throwing themselves off some stairs. How do I know that? Because exactly that has happened before they were made legal. I think people should get them savely.\n\nI also think the only way to really prevent abortions is education. Teach people how to practice safe sex. Give people access to the neccessary medicine, condoms, etc. And let women be able to get their tubes tied more easily. But as I said, the USA is gutting all of that too. No Sex ED in school because \"kids shouldn't be taught that nasty stuff\". No access to medicine or medical care for poor people because \"free Healthcare will ruin the country\" and they can't afford it. And you can't trust every guy to wear a condom either, it's only save when put on the right way and I know some guys who \"stealth\" and slip it off without their partner noticing before penetrating. Birth control pills come with a [plethora of nasty side effects](https://www.brown.edu/campus-life/health/services/promotion/content/what-are-side-effects-birth-control-pills) too.\n\nI agree with your second point somewhat. A guy should be able to suggest an abortion and if it's not granted the guy should be able to opt out of child support. Personally I got a vasectomy exactly because of that. You know how easy that was to get? One doctors appointment, no questions asked. Yet my girlfriend wants to get her tubes tied and the doctors wont do it because \"she might change her mind and want kids later\". \n\nFucking double standards indeed.",

                              "text": "I just read something earlier today on Reddit that helps in dealing with these people.  Here's my paraphrasing of the idea:\n\nLet's have a thought experiment.\n\nLet's say you're in a fertility clinic for whatever reason and the fire alarm goes off.  Almost immediately, you begin smelling smoke so you head for an exit.  On your way out, you hear someone screaming.  You rush in to see if you can help and find a 5-year-old girl standing in a room in front of a table, terrified and unable to move.  On the table, you see a large canister, on which the words \"1000 Viable Human Embryos\" are printed.  The smoke is getting thick and you're starting to cough.  You can only save one of the two and if you don't move now, you're all going to die.  Which one do you choose?\n\nEnd of experiment.\n\nThe person that was asked this had proclaimed that life begins at conception and anyone getting an abortion was a murderer.  When faced with the above experiment, they answer a simple \"Fuck you\" instead of answering the question.\n\nYou see, they can't answer it without a guilty conscience.  If they save the girl, they've \"murdered\" 1000 babies.  If they save the embryos, they've murdered a 5-year-old girl.\n\nQuite frankly, if anyone I asked this of ever says they'd let the girl die to save the canister, I think I might slap their face and I would definitely refuse to speak to them again.  For anyone who's pro-choice, the answer is clear - fuck the canister and get the child out.  For the pro-lifers or forced-birthers (depending on the strength of their beliefs about the subject) the answer is a horrible choice that they couldn't live with either way.  It's honestly sad that they would have to think about it before making a choice.\n\nIf only they'd look at the science and accept reality, then there wouldn't be a problem, but when have most of these people ever accepted reality?",

There are hundreds of Baptist churches that are LGBT friendly but the Southern Baptists have completely disavowed gay marriage. There is literally no way to know.\n\nI\u2019m really just using the LBGT example as a marker for what would appear to be a progressive church. Im not suggesting there is a direct correlation but it is probably the most documented and radical departure of traditional doctrine.

After a couple of months of unsuccessful but earnest effort and still not receiving any kind of divine babble, I realized all those people were full of shit and literally just blatantly lying to each other to fit in.\n\nI'm guessing that was a pentacostal church? Either way. I was never subjected to a church experience at any point in .y childhood that wasn't sickening or disturbing in some very fundamental way, and each of my parents tried just about every denomination you can imagine I'm sure. Hell, my mom eventually settled on Mormonism and she still believes in that shit--probably one of the more wild and crazy denominations to exist.",

                          "text": "tl;dr: I give one possible answer as to why people speak in tongues and then go off on a long-ass story about my own struggle with Christianity and growing up in a church that believed in speaking in tongues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grew up in a \"Jesus only\" church that's a lot like the Pentecostal church, but rejects the trinity (thus the \"Jesus only\").  Most of the people there believed in speaking in tongues and most of them did.   There were even a couple of people who believed they could interpret tongues.  My mother and both of her parents, as well as one of her brothers, all believed in it and all spoke in tongues.  Since I grew up in it, I, of course, tried to get the \"holy ghost\".  I spent the majority of my life begging God to give it to me so I could speak in tongues and therefore know I was going to heaven.  I was baptized in an actual river, which is where most churches like that do their baptisms.\n\nWhen I met my wife, we ended up going to a Pentecostal church where they spoke in tongues.  Compared to the churches I grew up in (these churches didn't have memberships and you weren't expected to tithe.  Most of the preachers even had day jobs), the tongues spoken in the Pentecostal church sounded \"fake\".  I believed that they were faking it, but the people at the churches I grew up in were not.  When I took my wife to one of those churches, she was shocked at speaking in tongues and \"shouting\" (I think some churches call it \"dancing in the spirit\" - no idea for certain though).  She told me afterward that she didn't want to say anything bad about my mom, but it all just seemed fake to her.  I knew my mom, and especially my grandparents would never intentionally fake something like that.  They honestly believed it and would have been highly insulted if accused of faking it.  To this day, my mother claims that she sometimes wakes up speaking in tongues because the lord visited her in her dreams.  Which got me thinking.\n\nSo I did some research online - and I don't mean looking at Facebook and YouTube.  First of all, speaking in tongues isn't just a Christian thing.  Other religions, I believe they were tied to Voodoo, but this was a while back and my memory may be off.  My research turned up several theories about speaking in tongues.  One is that it is similar to mass hypnosis.  One person has it, then it sort of infects the others.  It does so through peer pressure.  Someone meets someone who believes that they speak in tongues, so they naturally begin to tell others.  Most people will think they're crazy but they will eventually meet people who are curious about it.  These people see it and are convinced that the person is in direct contact with God.  There were others, but this is the one that stuck out in my head.\n\nNow, right now, I'm in a bad place.  I'm disillusioned with religion.  I know it all sounds like mumbo jumbo and that the ideas behind it are just silly.  I know that the bible is full of myths and mistakes.  I've been reading writings by several pastors who are trying to lead a \"new reformation\".  They're sick of the way the current Christian church is behaving.  In fact, they're actually as close to liberal Christians as I've ever seen.  They don't think that mankind can be saved because Jesus was a blood sacrifice to himself to save men from the punishment that he created himself for the rules he made and set them up to break.  They believe that salvation is achieved by repentance and cessation of sin.  They have no problems with gay people and even invite them to church.  They don't believe in hell.  Most impressive to me is that they think the \"apostle\" Paul was a fraud and a sham who took the ideas of Christianity and created a new Roman religion that ended up creating the Catholic Church, which eventually ended up creating the Protestant churches.  I like that because I never liked Paul.  His gospel made the least sense of everything else in the bible.\n\nNow, I know what you're probably thinking.  These guys are just repackaging an old religion into something hip.  I wonder that myself, but they even say that Jesus wasn't a sacrifice at all but was a political assassination to stop his preaching against the established Jewish church.  They talk about how Jesus didn't come from a poor family, but that he would have had to have been a fairly prestigious person because he and his brother were allowed to teach in the synagogue.\n\nBut, I said I was in a bad place.  You see, I'm not sure if I believe in any of it anymore.  I have an autoimmune illness that has slowly been progressing for the last 18 years or so.  I've been disabled since 2005.  More importantly, I've prayed for healing, and most of my family and my wife's family have done the same.  Now, the bible says that whenever 2 or more gather in Jesus' name, he will be among them.  It also says something about it being able to heal when 2 or more gather, I think.  It does, however, say that anything asked in Jesus' name will be given or, knock and it shall be opened - something like that.  Obviously, I've been knocking for a long time.  Hell, I've rung the doorbell.  Still, nothing's changed.  I'm still sick and still suffer every day.  Without a fentanyl patch, I'd be on the floor curled up in a ball and crying due to the agony.\n\nMy father-in-law, whom I hate with a passion and we don't speak to, is also disabled.  He's been through the whole \"pray, pray, pray, and pray some more\" thing too.  He finally gave up and became agnostic, in his words.\n\nI despise being anything like this man, but before he became agnostic, I was already beginning to move towards outright atheism and anti-theism.  My wife, however, was raised Southern Baptist and is still a Christian.  She doesn't follow any of the bullshit the Baptists have become though.  She still believes in the trinity but also believes that Jesus was a sacrifice.  However, she also believes in repentance being a big part of being saved and has lived by those beliefs.  She's a beautiful woman and was outright gorgeous when we first met.  I was 25 and she was 20.  And amazingly she was a virgin in this day and age.  I know it happens that some people do wait until marriage, but it's gotten pretty rare.\n\nThe hitch is that we both said a prayer about 2 weeks before we met.  We'd both gotten tired of meeting people that we just couldn't mesh with and had gotten tired of looking for \"the one\" and coming up with zilch.  So, we prayed and \"gave it up to God\".  Oddly enough, and I'm not lying or making this up, I asked God to find me a virgin because after my first wife had left and I'd ended up dating a total slut because of my self-worth being destroyed, I didn't feel like I could trust a woman who'd been around the block anymore.  Anyway, we met, dated, married, and have been together for about 25 years or more.  That's dating and marriage.  We've been married for 23 1/2 years now and have two awesome and beautiful young boys.\n\nMy point is, that I have one, but only one, event in life that seems like a prayer that was actually answered.  I know, I know.  It was probably just a really outlandish coincidence because they do happen but my wife believes it was two people praying for the same thing and that prayer being answered.  She also still believes in God, even though she's had doubts.  The doubts have only made her prickly when I bring up something negative about Christianity.\n\nI'm really, really close to being an atheist and just as close to being anti-theist because of the idea of what the church has done to my life.   However, I'm stuck in that spot, mostly because I've been so damned programmed with a fear of Hell.  I don't like it and I wish I could get rid of all doubts either way.  I just want to be one or the other, whether it's one of the \"new reformists\" Christians or an atheist.  I'm a firm believer in science, I believe tithes should be paid to the community through charities and not the church and if you don't have the money, well, don't worry about tithing until you do, if you ever do.  I'm a staunch liberal who despises Trump, MAGA, and most evangelicals.\n\nI just wish I could find peace and know what I believe and who I am.   Sorry for the long rant.  I really just meant to answer the question about what causes speaking in tongues.  I'll add a tl;dr at the top.",

                              "text": "I\u2019m sorry about your difficulty. I was also raised very religious and took several decades to be confidently atheist. They say there are no atheists in foxholes, but I knew it had finally \u201ctaken\u201d when my most precious \u201cpossession\u201d, my beloved dog (now 13) got out and I consciously didn\u2019t bother to ask or beg god to help me find him.\n\nBut, even though it took those few decades, the reasons for my atheism never changed from the original reasons that presented themselves to me at age 14. The textual reasons in the materials aren\u2019t important. What compelled me was the issue of geography. Far later in life I discovered John Locke seemed to have come to the same conclusion on that point.\n\nThe issue of geography means there is one main and possibly a secondary cause for every individual believing in their religion rather than another. The main reason is place/time. If we think of our, say, aunt, and imagine she was switched at birth with a baby in the Caucasus region where white people are Muslim. In my case, my aunt is Hispanic, but whatever. For the thought experiment. Our aunts, if raised in an area predominantly Muslim would be 100% staunch Muslims. Now switch them with babies in a Zoroastrian community in Iran and they would be Zoroastrian. Additionally, the children of the Muslim and Zoroastrian families, raised as our aunts, would be Christian.\n\nNow instead of place, you can also do time. If you wanted to remain right here in North America, we would only have to travel back in time 500 years to have our aunts be raised in the same place they were, and have their religion not be an Abrahamic religion at all, and they would wholeheartedly be a part of the religious community that was in either of their locations 500 years ago.\n\nThis idea that I had at fourteen told me that what is seemingly the most important part of most people\u2019s lives was completely determined by nothing but random chance. I had another variation to the scenario that didn\u2019t involve being switched at birth, being in another place or another time.\n\nThat variation involves the conquest and/or conversion of Europe, Asia (Russia) and North and South America. Those all had their original religious replaced by Christianity, but, in the case of Spain, it was, for a time, Muslim, and a certain European king considered converting to Islam in the Middle Ages. If this place had been colonized by Muslims, instead of Christians, our Aunts would also wholeheartedly be Muslims and nothing else would have to be changed.\n\nAfter these ideas occurred to me, it was impossible to view adherence any one particular religion as anything other than an interchangeable piece determined by nothing other than chance, like the language you grow up speaking, the songs that were taught to you as a child, the style of traditional clothing your family wears, the television shows you grow up watching, the types of trees you are familiar with, etc. Most people are just going to adopt whatever is prevalent and expected of them, and if you changed what was prevalent and expected, it would change what they adopt.\n\nThe guilt and pressure applied by family and community never go away, but I could never unthink my ideas, and their unlimited repercussions. The fervently devout followers of no longer practiced religions like the one every one of the planets in our solar system and some months of the year are named after-our entire families would have been taking Jupiter, Juno (June), seriously, celebrating Saturn-alia, and being horrified if we questioned it.",

I was terrified of the notion of hell, and it made so much damage to my mental and emotional state for a long time to know that \"beloved christian people\" would be so nonchalant about me suffering eternally while they deemed themselved worthy of heaven. I went to therapy and started questioning the nature of my fears. I had placed way too much value in the words and perceptions of other people, and trying to chase it and accomodate to that while also being true to myself was just confusing and caused a lot of anxiety. I could never truly trust myself (because I trusted their judgement too much), and I could never fully trust \"them\" either (because deep down I trusted my judgement, too).  \n\n\nI realized I was inheriting and interiorizing fears that had nothing to do with me and everything to do with everybody else's reasons to escape through the religious door. They feel the need to \"be saved\" from going to a place that doesn't exist and spend their lives worrying that they'd lose their \"salvation\", based on their own personal (or local church) judgement of what their salvation entails. In reality, there is no such dilemma in the first place. There is no hell, just like there is no heaven. There is no final judgement. There is no need to even worry about it anymore for me.\n\nI realized that even the wisest-seeming \"elders\" in church were still operating under big biases that they'd never give up, because it's forbidden to see things differently. My doubts about this whole thing started to dissipate when I was able to see through their apparent wisdom, and when I realized my arguments and questionings were just as valid as their beliefs. Their beliefs don't hold me prisoner anymore.",

                              "text": "I used to be terrified of hell as a child. It was one of my biggest obstacles in becoming an atheist, despite me logically understanding that hell couldn\u2019t exist. What\u2019s helped me is realizing that people are capable of change, and that most humans are fundamentally good. \n\nI remember being a kid and wanting to do good in the world, and I remember other kids being the same way, even as we were being little assholes to each other. Our base state as humans is not evil and sinful, it\u2019s goodness. Mistakes and assholery are inevitable because life is complicated and we\u2019re all still learning, but most of us want to rectify our wrongs and do better as people. Even \u2018bad people\u2019 think of themselves as good (and find ways to justify their behavior) because that\u2019s how ingrained our wish to be good is. Even then, given the right environment, those people can change.\n\nSo hell is objectively an evil, cruel thing for a supposedly loving god/father to create. What kind of father tells his struggling children that they are inherently evil and should be punished forever for it? What kind of father abuses one son for the sake of another and calls that holiness? It\u2019d be one debate if hell was reserved for rape, which is a crime that has no excuse, but you can be sent for hell for literally telling a white lie. Because for some reason, if there\u2019s even the smallest evidence that you\u2019re not perfect, then you deserve eternal punishment. That\u2019s the logic of a narcissistic abuser. \n\nGod doesn\u2019t exist. I was terrified that believing this would lead to me suffering forever if I was wrong. What mollified me was realizing anyone who believes humans are inherently evil are themselves justifying evil.\n\nIt\u2019s best explained by this quote: \u201cWithout hell, what\u2019s to stop me from raping all I want? And my answer is: I do rape all I want. And the amount I want is zero. And I do murder all I want, and the amount I want is zero. The fact that these people think that if they didn\u2019t have this person watching over them that they would go on killing, raping rampages is the most self-damning thing I can imagine.\u201d\n\nWith that in mind, I\u2019ve realized that hell is a construction made by narcissistic abusers who needed to excuse their own evil and needed a way to control people. I doubt the universe could be created by someone so obviously humanly evil and abusive. Even if the Christian god did create the universe/hell, I would not worship him, not even to save my soul, because that would be the equivalent of worshipping Satan. So every night, I\u2019m actively comforted to go to bed knowing that all my ancestors who didn\u2019t believe in god (bc they were Chinese, how tf would they have even heard of the Christian god in the first place, much less believe in him? Lol, again, Christianity makes no sense) are at rest in sweet oblivion and not burning in a fire made up by an evil, evil god, because he doesn\u2019t exist and neither does hell. \n\nAnyways, I recommend watching The Good Place. It\u2019s a fun good show that philosophically questions morality and the Christian after life, and it will open your mind to alternatives to the Christian idea of Heaven and hell. It was really good for giving me tools to fight my indoctrination, and it partially inspired the above framework I used to defeat hell. \n\nSpoilers for the show: Personally, if there was an afterlife that did exist, I\u2019d want it to be The Good Place\u2019s final reimagining of it, where you get to be in a safe environment to learn from your mistakes and flaws to become a better person, and then once you\u2019ve improved, you get be with your friends and family and everybody else in a world where all your needs and wants are met, where everybody else has also done the work to become better people, too.",

We agree that abortion is okay and evangelicals are actually evil pretenders in most cases.  Her mom just texted us a link yesterday about how some lady \"owned\" a \"WOKE!\" transexual woman in a debate.  It's sickening and even my wife thinks that.  That's one of the reasons we can live together as long as we have, but I still tell her that I'm still at least a little Christian because I don't want my disbelief to hurt our relationship.  Is that wrong?  Yes, yes it is, but I'd do almost anything to stay with her, as long as it doesn't go strictly against my morals.\n\nMy kids aren't being raised to fear hell.  They're being taught the actual message that Jesus, if he was real, taught.  Love thy neighbor as thyself.  In other words, don't be a dick.  I think we should all follow that rule, and I don't think I've ever met an atheist who has disagreed with that.  Yeah, my kids are being taught to love God but to follow their own path at the same time.  They don't get the hell fire and damnation shit. I'm actually trying to get my wife on the \"new reformation\" bandwagon.  They basically teach that hell doesn't exist, Jesus didn't die for the remission of sin (he was murdered for political reasons), the \"apostle\" Paul was a lying misogynistic prick who ruined Christianity, and a lot of other stuff that she already believes or could easily accept.

I will give you the biblical answer, as I understand it, from the Pentecostal church interpretation. \n\nThere are many Christian churches that believe speaking in tongues (in public, without an interpreter) is wrong. The Pentecostal church, however, pushes it and even requires it in order to enter heaven. According to how they choose to interpret the Bible, there are two different types of speaking in tongues. The first one I\u2019ll mention is the type that is spoken in prophecy. Most Christian churches allow this type, but it MUST have an interpretation. This means you have to have someone with the gifts of prophecy, and someone with the gift of interpretation in order to receive this direct message from God. These types of messages are said to ALWAYS be in a language that is, or has been known to man. It may be a language that is extinct, but it is always a real human language and not one that the speaker or interpreter is fluent in (this will matter later). \n\nNow let me explain the type of tongues OP and other commenters are referring to. This type of tongues is used within the Pentecostal church and possibly others, I\u2019m not really sure. The Pentecostal church requires that you \u201creceive the gift of the Holy Spirit\u201d in order to go to heaven. This is proven by speaking in tongues. When they say this, they are referring to the type of tongues you use while praying. This type is different from the gift of prophecy because it is not a real language and does not require an interpreter because it is an \u201cangelic language\u201d meant only to be heard by God. I have always felt that the Bible did not intend for this to be a public act, that speaking in tongues should be done in private. Not the Pentecostal church, they believe if you got it flaunt it. It is usually a literal competition as to who can pray in tongues the loudest, or longest, and the more emotional you get, the better. I\u2019ve had hands put on my face, shaking my head to get me to pray in tongues so I could receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.  \n\nI suggest checking it out sometime if you feel like witnessing the most ridiculous thing possible. It is quite the spectacle. When I finally got out of that church, I realized how abusive and controlling it was. There are so many horrible things they do, tongues is almost the least of them. It really pushed me away from any form of organized religion and opened my eyes to how the church breeds narcissism. \n\nAnyway, I know this answer was long but I thought you might enjoy knowing the actual what behind it.",

I'm generally pretty easy going in relationships. I usually let the girls I date have things their way. My SOs happiness is really important to me. But whenever the subject of kids comes up, that is one of the very few things I will not bend on. Any kids we have will not be raised religious. No church, no Sunday school, no baptisms, nothing like that. No way, no how, never. If they aren't ok with that, we absolutely will not be having kids. Intentionally lying to your children as a way of life to instill harmful lifelong delusions in them is, in my opinion, child abuse. It is not something you do to someone you love. I may not be able to deprogram my partner. Chances are that relationship won't work out long term. I can try again with another girl if things don't work out. But kids are a lifelong commitment. No way in hell can I hurt them like that. You don't know me and have no reason to care what I think, but please, don't do that to your kids.",

              "text": "I'm not on this sub but it was on my popular feed so maybe I could offer some outsider input?\n\nI grew up pentecostal and now I think I'd call myself baptist maybe? To be honest I just listen to pastors who explain the historical and cultural significance of what's been written instead of the wild stuff people come up with nowadays. So if that's a Baptist or pentecostal as long as they are staying true to the history and the text then I'm happy. Anyways.\n\nI have a lot of problems with the pentecostal side of things. I'll be honest I've seen it fuck up a lot of kids. Stuff along the lines of stunted social development and warped view of reality. I used to be one of those kids. I had zero capability to hold a normal conversation and be a part of society around me. Another part of my beef with pentecostals is they feel like they have an absolute and definite corner on the truth. They are somehow \"the special ones\". They have it all together and everyone else including other denominations don't. The entire Bible is all about teaching us nobody has it together but I often see differing sentiments in pentecostalism.\n\nThere's this term in Christianity called \"missionary dating\". Basically it's when a Christian likes a non Christian and dates them and truly believes that through the relationship, the Christian can turn the non Christian into a believer. It's looked down on in the Christian world as it should be. It really sounds like that's what's going on here. I see a lot of this in adults who have been heavily affected as a child in the pentecostal world. They don't have the emotional maturity to say \"this person and I aren't on the same page. Therefore this isn't a good idea for a relationship\". \n\nIf I were in your boots I'd end the relationship. I'd encourage you to do some research on missionary dating and choose for yourself if that applies to you and how you want to handle it. I wish you both the best whether that's together or separate.",

There is no reason that in her beliefs she should not accept your personal experience with God.\n\nDo you not smoke or use alcohol? Is your dress similar to men in her clergy? Are you ok with not wearing a wedding ring or not celebrating certain holidays. I\u2019m Catholic and could pretty much pass on just about any Holiday for good Netflix binge. Are you willing to go through an Adult baptism? Most Christianity believes in Baptism.\n\nI am surprised that you are \u201csharing a bed\u201d, as sex outside of marriage is completely taboo. But again don\u2019t focus on her hypocrisy toward her religion. Only your common belief.\n\nAll that said, your relationship is probably doomed. Are you really going to be able to sit and watch a documentary about the James Web telescope and the sun being 4 trillion years old with her? That should be a real winner. I\u2019d rather have an ice pick in my ear. Are you going to have a discussion with her about the laws of physics and that matter cannot be created or destroyed, so therefore time has no beginning?\n\nI find fundamentalists to be hypocritical, ignoring the cultures of others completely and considering them aboriginal in nature, and ignoring any science which conflicts with the beliefs handed down from the church.\n\nTypically they are unable to distinguish a scientifically based theory from the one the preacher gave in a sermon. Also many of the churches have no Central authority leading to all kinds of crazy offshoots. If I want to start a biker or marijuana church I make it Baptist as there is no authority that approves or denies me from doing so.",

And nobody would question your use of the word theory here.\n\nAnd yet in science the same word is used for an explanation derived from intense study, testing and all the available data.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nTheory: a supposition or a system of ideas intended to explain something, especially one based on general principles independent of the thing to be explained.\n\nScientific Theory: A scientific theory is an explanation of an aspect of the natural world and universe that has been repeatedly tested and corroborated in accordance with the scientific method [...]\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHonestly maybe it'd be better for everyone if science just started using a different term that is not widely associated with wild guessing. Chances of Conservatives not slandering such a new term before it reaches popular acceptance are obviously non existant.",

It's unfortunate because it's useful to have words in specialist fields that mean something specific to people working in that field, without being overly concerned with how the layperson will interpret it.\n\nIt's interesting that in English we have many words from different linguistic roots, that mean the same thing when translated literally but in the contexts we use it (science, legal etc.) it often has a subtly different meaning than the other word. That makes it efficient to know exactly what someone means in fields where precision of language is key. But of course casual language will evolve regularly, it's important to have a way to communicate in specialist fields that isn't subject to that.\n\nIf laypeople wouldn't pretend they're experts then maybe we wouldn't have this issue.

So In wonder what relationships you're thinking about it you think breaking up is recommended too quickly? Even if a relationship can be saved, in my view it is hardly worth it - one could invest the same time and energy in a relationship that is healthy from the start.",

          "text": "As someone who has just deconstructed officially (though tbh it\u2019s been a process going on for years) I have always refused to date guys who were devout. Even when I still was Christian something about Christian guys always rubbed me the wrong way. I\u2019ve had instances when I was in high school where grown adults attempted to try and groom me. No thanks. Obviously I knew they were full of shit and creepy af. Not that all are bad per say, and obviously this was just my personal experience when in dating Christian guys (as a legal adult not when I was in high school with the creeps) they always ended up treating me with little to no respect than guys were \u201csecular\u201d. Just in general I didn\u2019t feel like I was being treated the way I wanted to be treated. I also felt that conversing with them and sharing my thoughts and questions on things (of the Bible, science, and the universe)were dismissed or that they couldn\u2019t even keep up with a conversation with topics other than faith based, Bible thumping, conversations. Kind of bland and mind numbing ngl. \n\nI also have never desired to have children (at least biologically) and I always had the narrative that I should get married, be a housewife, and pop out kids because that\u2019s my purpose shoved down my throat by family and church. No freedom of thought, to be myself, or to do something different with my life. I was never a fan of living a life like that. And Christian guys are looking for exactly that, women who are submissive, have no critical thinking skills (gullible), and someone to play house with. I never wanted that for myself so it was always a turn off for me to even try dating Christian men. \n\nAlso, I have known and seen so many Christian married couples who have always had so much drama in their relationships. I get every couple does but it just seems so much more prevalent in Christianity. They just seem miserable like a good 80% of the time. I think it\u2019s because they don\u2019t seek certified counseling with practical advice to help. Additionally, they keep trying to hold themselves and each other to unrealistic standards and expectations according to what the Bible wants. For example, if a guy just isn\u2019t a natural born leader and the woman is in the relationship she is forced to step down and prod her husband along to be a \u201cleader\u201d. Because that\u2019s \u201cgOd\u2019s RoLes fOr MaRriage\u201d. It just makes them so much more miserable trying to fit themselves into a box like that. Instead, they should go to couple\u2019s counseling and stop trying to force themselves in unrealistic roles to get \u201cGod\u2019s favor\u201d and just accept each other for who they are. \n\n\nI think this is one of many things that turned me off from Christianity in general and fueled my deconstruction. Of course it wasn\u2019t the only thing there was A LOT. But, please don\u2019t put yourself through that. If they want you to abide by their religious stupidity, then please, save yourself the pain and move on. Plenty of fish in the sea, or you don\u2019t have to date or be in a romantic relationship if you don\u2019t want to.",

(added: my grandfather was such an extremist that the pastor at his own church asked him to stop talking to the younger generations because he was scaring them off.)\n\nNever found a way around it. Just switching topics away from religion as often as possible didn\u2019t always work, so best was to keep weekly visits Mom and I made short and leave when his ranting got too bad. I find Pentecostal the most intolerant I\u2019ve personally dealt with. Don\u2019t see how a relationship can work \u2014 surprised she\u2019d even get into one with a non-Pentecostal.",

She told me shortly before breaking up for the last time that she had been driving by my house to see if I was home every days for over two years.  Our garage was on the back of the property and you couldn't see our cars from the street...Last I heard she said she had a dream where god told her she was going to marry a preacher.  A guy at her church overheard her say that and told her he had a dream where god told him he was going to be a preacher.  I got lucky that I got out when I did.  Her pastor didn't like me because I called him on his hypocrisy and overall bullshit.  Her husband never became a preacher either.",

Like, if a person is a good person and lives virtuously because they believe it's just the right thing to do they still go to hell just because they didn't believe something that lacked any evidence? In my opinion a god who would send good people to hell for not believing in him while failing to provide any evidence for his existence is a terrible god and not one I'd ever want to follow. Clearly that god values worship of himself above all else. I've actually convinced friends to rethink their faith with that argument. Though to be fair I convinced them while we were still kids so probably it wouldn't work as well on an adult who is cemented in their belief. Still possible though..",

He doesn't want people he loves to suffer forever yet throws them all into Hell anyway. The god of the Bible has the common characteristics of dictators and sadistic rulers throughout history.

How many atheists in this sub can say that they were also ultra-religious and acted irrationally at some point in their lives? More than a few, I think. I don't think it's okay for so many to just flippantly suggest that you break things off with this woman without knowing more about you.\n\nAs for advice, I don't know you, her, or your relationship, so I can't give direct advice. I can only tell you what I would do. \n\nI would attempt to determine if there is any way she can be pushed off her religion. If I thought that was an option, I would slowly and gently starting nudging her off beliefs. I would also have to weigh my feeling for her, and the relationship we've built, against the very difficult process of tearing someone away from their beliefs. \n\nIf I didn't think I was capable of changing her mind, or I didn't think it was worth it, I would have to end things and move on. \n\nOr you could always just give it time and hope the problem fixes itself, but I feel like this might be the worst option.",

Even the other church denominations thought we were weird for it.\n\nThe way it was explained to me and that I had subscribed to back then was that you reach the point where your real language during prayer wasn\u2019t enough to describe how you felt and so the \u201choly spirit\u201d would sort of \u201ctake over\u201d and you would just start to babble nonsense, which no one including you would understand, but the holy spirit and god understood it, and it was a \u201cnext level\u201d \u201cenlightened\u201d way of communing with god. \n\nOf course the literal \u201cspeak in tongues\u201d night at summer camp each year where they practically forced it on you ensured that must of us had done it. I didn\u2019t fake it, or maybe a better way to say it is I didn\u2019t believe I was faking it. I thought it was real and felt the emotion of it all, but looking at it now it\u2019s very clear I forced it wanting to reach some ideal I had been told was the goal since birth basically. \n\nI was a worship pastor, and an expert at eliciting emotion from other people AND myself. It sickens me now, as I could turn that emotion on like a switch to manipulate how people felt during a song or for myself with speaking tongues to convince myself I was communing in some special way. \n\nThe thing is, towards the end of my faith, I realized how fake it all was when I found myself doing exactly this one Sunday and manipulating a crowd of almost 1,000 people into going along with me and the entire time in my head I was thinking \u201cI don\u2019t believe any of this bullshit anymore and they have no idea\u2026 and they are eating it up\u2026\u201d.\n\nI stepped down/quit the next day.

The thing is though, at least in our churches (the 3 of us) , there was NO freedom to be honest about it or question it. In fact, if we had even hinted at it or just asked the question we likely would have lost our jobs, friends, and possibly even families. There was no incentive to truly question, and every incentive to just shove down the questions and fall in line or risk losing everything. \n\nYour entire life is built around this, I think that\u2019s something a lot of atheists don\u2019t understand. My wife and kids might even leave me, your friends would certainly abandon you (or risk being shunned themselves), your extended family would \u201clove\u201d you, but basically want nothing to do with you. There\u2019s a very real possibility of losing every single thing in your life including your job when you are that deep (since my job was with the church). \n\nThat just breeds an environment of never truly questioning the status quo. I\u2019ll be honest, If my wife hadn\u2019t been willing to make the journey with me (she did and is an atheist as well now) I think I would be a \u201cChristian\u201d still today, pretending just to keep my family together but a closet atheist. It sounds cowardly, but my kids and my wife are my everything and it\u2019s way more complicated than people might think or realize to turn your back on the very thing your entire life has been built around.",

It completely makes sense why people choose to stay in the religious environment, even if they are internally questioning it and are miserable in it. It\u2019s kind of like why people stay in toxic/abusive relationships. Which is why I think a movement towards more a accepting attitude in churches is due. One that encourages questions, doubts, and conversation. Though I always wonder- if that type of environment existed, would the unsound logic of the religious philosophy be more obvious and more people would leave the church? \n\nWhat I\u2019ve always been confused about, is doesn\u2019t religion teach about acceptance and love? It seems to always do just the opposite.. or maybe I\u2019m generalizing too much? \n\nP.s. that\u2019s awesome that your wife was supportive of your transition and that you were able to pursue the life path that felt genuine to you.",

Maybe, but that church would likely not make any money or garner very many members. \n\nI think you hit on it when you said that this kind of logic would cause many to actually see religion for what it is and leave, rather than stay. It\u2019s probably why so much of the scholarship around the Bible rarely makes it\u2019s way down to the average church member. Many of these church leaders went to seminary or learned some of the problems with the Bible, but they are rarely passed on to parishioners, likely because the church won\u2019t keep many members if people don\u2019t buy into it. \n\nAnd no I don\u2019t think you are generalizing too much, the church at large (though not all of them) hardly follow Jesus\u2019 actual teachings. He would almost certainly be called a socialist/communist if he came back today and branded a dangerous heretic.

Because of your mutual dishonesty, neither of you are relating to each other, therefore there is no relationship, just a lie.\n\nSame thing happened to my father, except he actually converted and stuck with it. Absolutely terrible marriage. Made my childhood like a horror movie, and I've barely spoken to either of them in 20 years. Get the hell out while you still can. Find someone you don't have to be dishonest with. Don't be a dumbass. She is in the world's most dangerous cult, and you're toeing the edge of it.

I was studying Geology in university at the time, and thought that the amount of evidence I could show her would convince her.\n\nThis accentually led me down the rabbit hole of atheists debunking creationist claimed, and claims of the divine. I became an atheist because of her. Had I met a easygoing Christian I doubt I\u2019d\u2019ve put much thought into the question. \n\nIt ended with me braking things off with her, because even though we loved each other I could not see how we could raise a child. I am now a father, and am grateful that I don\u2019t have to combat my wife over our child\u2019s education. My wife is religious, but in a progressive form of Christianity. We respect each other\u2019s beliefs, even if it has caused us to negotiate on how it will take part in our relationship. \n\nI don\u2019t think that mix faith relationships are bad, but I do think that their has do be boundaries and common ground. The tree most important things for me in a relationship is politics, money, and religion.",

This is the definition of an abusive relationship.  She thinks God loves her, but he has never once demonstrated that love in any tangible way. Like all abused people, she will double down and continue to do her best to not make her loving god angry. \n\n Trust me, the crying is manipulation.  This is exactly how these people operate.  I was extremely resistant to the being \"filled by the Holy Ghost\".  At first people, including my parents, tried reasoning and love bombing me.  When that didn't work, they began with the tears and fears tactics.  Their words were meant to scare me to death in order to get me to change my mind.  In the end, they just wore me down and I pretended to believe.  Looking back, I see that it was all manipulation.  Having been a young adult pentecostal  woman, I guarantee you that your girlfriend sees you as her own personal mission project. She believes that she can lead you to the lord and set you on the right path.  She has a lot at stake because if she fails to convert you, your relationship will never be blessed by her church or family.  This is because we were taught that we were not to be \"unequally yoked\" with a non-believer. \n\n I'm sorry to say this, but this is a no win situation for you.  If you love her enough to be together, you will have to become something you are not and watched your future children be indoctrinated to a religion that preaches hate and practices authoritarianism.  Trust me.  I lived 20 years like that and it took its toll on my mental and physical health.",

This exact thought has been my entire premise in regards to religion, faith, etc since I had a frightful conversation with a fanatical friend as a kid.  Not much  unlike what you're dealing with.\n\nIt doesn't have anything to do with you. Your partner is struggling with personal fears and insecurities. Pentecostal friends I've known, for example, are VERY liberal with their individualism. Your reasoning would be like throwing water on a grease fire. Am I \"good\" isn't a part of the \"I'm going to do what feels good\" lifestyle. IF that is something you appreciate about her, I'd highly recommend leaving it be.\n\nChange the conversation. Something like; are you happy? Have you eaten? How was your day?  Focus on happiness and health. What she does or does not truly believe will work itself out and it's nobodies business. She's not questioning what you believe or what's going to happen to you. At least not in the long term. It's about happiness and guilt. Specifically hers. Specifically, why you and not she could be the reason for for a lack of happiness or an abundance of guilt. Pivot. Do the things that make ya'll happy because it sounds like she is preparing herself to do something that's making her her feel guilty. She's distancing herself emotionally now and you'll understand why she's doing it later on if you wait for it to happen.",

They don't just have a \"warped view of reality\", it's like they *refuse* to see the reality around them. They especially refuse any notion that challenges their delusions. They'd always say that they're \"in this world, but not from it\". The only otherwordly thing I witnessed was their lack of critical thinking. There's no reasoning with them. You will burn out way before they accept they're wrong (because the bible is never wrong, right?).",

If she believes it to the point she is crying because you will go to hell because of the way she was raised its very likely that if you two have children they will be brought up with those beliefs.\n\nIts fine for you to share your faith with your children but only if you respect their decisions when they turn 5 and can figure out its all bullshit but thats very rarely the approach parents take. My wife is imho taking Pascale wager but her family, while not Bible thunmpers, are believers. I didnt stop my son from going to church with his friends but I did step in when he turned 10 and didn't believe it anymore and wanted to stop going and people tried to insist he continued.No one forced me into a belief that I thought was false so I'm not going to nor allow anyone else to force my kids. \n\nThis isn't something you guys can ignore much longer regardless of how you feel about each other. Look at the pain and emotional stress her upbringing has caused her. Have you shared any resources with her? Have her watch some debates of Hitchens or call in on the Atheist Experience and pose some questions to them. If anyone with a rational mind reads up on the serious plot holes of religion it has to at the very least put some doubt into their mind.\n\nYou guys can't stay together with this hanging over you, I mean you can but its going to be miserable and eventually cause resentment. Its the same thing as if she were crying because Santa isn't going to bring you an xmas gift, you just need to now get her to realize it. Maybe get her into some counseling to help her come at this thing logically and see what it is that keeps her holding on to this belief system because life is too short and you only get 1 and after that it's oblivion so best not waste anymore life on a problem that isn't a problem.

For me, a religious person was always going to be a deal breaker but it wasn't until I was in my 30s that I was able to stop trying. Man, I forgot until just now the time I narrowly avoided what could have been a horrible car accident with my girlfriend in the car. The rest of the drive, she bawled about me going to hell if I would have died. That led to a discussion about why she believed that I, a good person,  deserved to be tortured for all eternity. That was the end of that relationship. \n\nSome people may not be bothered by mixed religious views but I can't fathom it, especially once children are in the mix. If her views are that strong (and that delusional), it's going to create bigger and bigger problems in the future. I know reddit is always quick to tell people to end relationships and it's never that easy once you've developed feelings for a person. It's your journey but my guess is that future you is going to be embarrassed that it took you so long to get out of this relationship. And the fact that you're here asking strangers for advice kind of tells me that you already know what you should do.",

Every decision she does is going to be influenced by her beliefs. \n\nIn my situation her beliefs were:\n\nShe was religious, probably not to the point to cry in her sleep because she was worried about me going to hell, but she prayed every day, everything that happened to her life was thank to god. \n\nAnd, probably if it was only the two of us I could have tolerated but when she started talking about having a family, that's when things got difficult. \n\nShe wanted to rise her kids with her beliefs and it's totally understandable but I do want to raise my kids with my beliefs so it was kind of an issue.\n\nThen the other things started to appear for example...\n\nShe \"tolerated\" homosexuality but she thought it was wrong and UNNATURAL.\n\nShe had really strong opinions about \"Gender identity\", when the Buzz Lightyear movie came out, it was HUGE issue and discussion. \n\nShe didn't exactly believed in evolution, she was a strong supporter of Creationism. This was one MONUMENTAL red flag but still I decided to ignore it. She made a snarky comment like: \"So you actually believe we came from the monkey?\" \n\nBut the straw that broke the camel's back and the moment I was like: \"WTF I'm doing here...\" was the Roe v Wad, she was totally anti-abortion.... and for me that was just inexcusable \n\nEvery single of these beliefs were because of religion or related to religion. \n\nSo, don't fool yourself into thinking that it wont matter, you can tolerate it or you can find a way. \n\nShe might be an amazing, caring, loving girl, as my ex was, but the way we saw the world was totally opposites.",

      "text": "Hello 20-something me.\n\nHere's the high level notes: as much as you want this, she will eventually reject you. It will be messy and it's going to suck, but it will happen.\n\nI've been there. My gf from college was highly religious. Not speaking in tongues religious, but not far off. She was great. Cute, attractive inside and out, her heart was in the right place, she was plenty smart enough to keep up when I got rambling about something I knew deeply that she hadn't spent much time thinking about... Sex life was grand, we got into remarkably few arguments. Life was good.\n\nThen, like all things that have been going on for a while, she started to think about, not only where we were in the relationship, but where we were going. Future, kids, family, life and death.... And the arguments started. I'm going to hell, I'm going to burn in a lake of fire. Etc etc. I'm sure we've all heard it before. Certainly you have, OP. I kept at it and argued the merits of our relationship. I did everything I could. Eventually, as it got more frequent and I got more tired of it and worn down about it, I started to lose my motivation to argue the point anymore. I'd made all my viewpoints clear and I didn't want to argue anymore.\n\nFor the sake of clarity, I'm not fully atheist, probably more spiritual/agnostic, but I definitely believe that if there's some kind of diety out there, it's certainly not strictly following the rules written in a book; any book. So, by that logic, such a diety is unknowable, so it becomes pointless to try. I have no issues with other people having faith, and believing whatever they want, just don't try to convert me and we're cool. Anyways...\n\nShe came to the conclusion that she didn't want to be with someone who she couldn't spend eternity with in heaven, and the relationship ended. For years after things officially ended, we would meet up, have some laughs, sometimes get down, and then she'd have a minor meltdown about the evil of it all and run off again. Sometimes for days, weeks, or even months before I'd hear from her again.\n\nAfter long enough, I started dating someone else, shortly after that she stopped calling, and that was that. It was long, tiring, emotionally draining and demoralizing while it went on. I hope she's living her best life, and I'm glad I'm not a part of that anymore. I'd happily be her friend again, but even if I find myself single, I wouldn't take her back. I might go for drinks, have a laugh and maybe wake up next to her, but I'd never ever regularly date her again. I will not put myself through that ever again.\n\nSo I say to you this, OP: it sucks. There's no way to frame this that doesn't suck. You've poured your heart into this relationship, and now you're at a crossroads. Just know that no matter what you say or do, you cannot change her mind. You can argue facts and science all you want but it's impossible to drag someone out of the religious darkness. You can only show them the path, it is up to them to walk it, and leave that religion behind. Most people put up their faith like impenetrable armor, that anything that can't be explained through normal means is \"because God\". Usually in a far too arrogant way. The equivalent of plugging your ears and saying \"la la la, I can't hear you! La la la\".\n\nUnless she somehow miraculously finds her faith to be a poor excuse for the mystery of the universe, you can't change her. If this is a deal-breaker for her, then I'm sorry, it's already over. You just have to figure out what's already happened and actually break up. Until then, you're in for a hell of an emotional roller coaster, and it's going to end the same way.\n\nI'm so very very sorry bro. I hated going through it myself. It brings me no pleasure to know others are still going through stuff like this.\n\nTake care of yourself OP. All the best.",

Everyone working in science is looking for ways to disprove the current theories, because that's how science advances: they find the errors and make refinements in the theories so that they account for all the evidence in existence.\n\n2) There are living bushes that are older than 10,000 years, so the world being created that recently would require the god doing so to fabricate evidence and lie to us.\n\n3) what kind of sick entity is this loving creator, that they'd create a place to torture their beloved creations for all of eternity with no chance of escape, just because they didn't believe in some stories that have zero evidence to back them up, and they look exactly like something a priest/con man would make up to gain power and money?    Even this guy's alleged disciples didn't write any of the stuff he said down until at least 30 years after his death, and there are zero contemporary writings featuring this guy and any of the miracles he supposedly performed in front of hundreds or even thousands of people.  They have surviving tax records from that time and place, but no mention of anyone curing lepers or raising the dead.  There's thousands of gods out there, and there is no evidence that would allow anyone to deduce correctly which one is real, since they all have the exact same amount of evidence to support them (zero).  It's a sick and twisted deity that would torture their creations for eternity for guessing wrong - a loving god would leave some evidence behind and a way to test and know for sure that you had picked the right god to believe in.  The people portrayed in the bible didn't have to depend on \"faith\" as everyone today is told to - they talked to god and got actual replies, and people were showing up left and right performing supernatural miracles right in front of their faces.  Today we get child molesting priests teaching people the prosperity gospel, sleeping with their married congregants, and preaching hate.  It's a pretty weak god that can't even help his branded salesmen to sin one iota less often than the general population, even inside his franchise locations.\n\nIt's sweet that she cares enough about you to be worried about you to the point of tears, but you're going to have to get through to her that you don't feel threatened by a ticket to Hell, since such a place can't exist without the god offering to save you from it being an absolute monster.  Either she learns to live with you being who you are, or she lets you go so she can find someone gullible enough to enjoy the delusions.  Demanding that you change who you are and embrace for the rest of your life absurdities that you know can't be true is a recipe for you spending the rest of your life living a lie and being unhappy.",

Biblically, her questioning/worrying if you ascend into heaven or descend into the abyss, is stated clearly, DO NOT do that. You technically never even have to say out loud that you believe in miracles etc. only that Christ is Lord. Oh, and that Christ in verse 4 of Romans 10, just ended the law of righteousness... i.e. bull shit rules that inevitably kill you according to verse 5. Romans, a letter being written to Israel/Jews of whom the law is written for, says that believing in Christ is the end of the laws of righteousness (old testament commandments). You doing your best to spread unconditional love to everyone, is what Jesus is all about. To all those \"believers\" who speak against \"sins\" or talk about heaven or hell... They are the biggest sinners you're looking at, at that moment, and the biblical God wants to spit their luke-warm butts out.\n\nWhen you realize that these people actually believe in alternate universes after death, yet have no desire for scientifically observing and studying the universe in the reality they are currently set in... You realize you're dealing with people who don't think things through. I was definitely one of those people. The fear of sin drove me to \"hide the word in my heart\", so I might do less of said sinning; and yet the very book being used to blind me, freed me of those blinders. \nFYI, I'm a completely non-religious joyful agnostic who can appreciate the fuck out of all religions now! Keep reminding yourself that it takes time and the only way to grow is to expose YOURSELF to the light. There might be slivers of truths/love to her base line reasonings (like she wants to spend eternity with you!) so try and hold onto that. \nAsk questions until her ears fall off, your conversation will grow your friendship and lead you to more clear path ways of choices. You may need to move on if she cannot listen to scripture telling her she's wrong though, there is devotion and then there are luddites. Devotion is a living thing, luddites are not.",

My dad started out atheist but my brother and I were raised fully immersed in some beliefs that just seem crazy even compared to other Christian sects.\n\nWhen my brother and I were very young, my parents were members of a church inspired by the Pentecostal tradition that turned into a Christian sex cult where many children were abused and one child was even drowned by their mother because the mother believed the child had been possessed by demons.\n\nI am also an exorcism survivor from when my mother tried to cast demons out of me when they found out I was in a sexual relationship. They then sent me\u2014a victim of sexual abuse\u2014to sex addict counseling, which you know, kind of sends the wrong message to a victim of abuse.\n\nPentecostals believe some really strange things, which then leads to real harm. Your children may  be exposed to some really crazy people when your partner forces you to send them to church.\n\nDid I mention yet that when you marry someone that you also marry their family? There\u2019s no way to avoid it, so think about that, too. After all this experience, a good Christian family member tried to sexually assault me when I was living with them.\n\nI kept this to myself for 15 years because I didn\u2019t believe anyone would believe me, until a flashback and breakdown helped me realize the past was only taking more of a hold of me the longer I kept it inside. Until healing through counseling from a great psychologist, I ended up living with PTSD for most of my adult life. There are multiple times I planned suicide, and the impacts of all these experiences impacted my normal daily life as well.\n\nYou need to get the fuck out of this relationship, my friend. Religion attracts some really fucked up people and distorts regular people\u2019s minds with beliefs and actions and words that cause real harm. You\u2019ve got one shot at life, go make one where you can where you can find a partner who isn\u2019t holding beliefs that we should all consider insane.

Can you imagine how she must feel all the time? Living in fearful obedience to this thing she disagrees with? A hateful, vengeful, arbitrary god who controls the universe and afterlife? The terror of it. =(\n\nAnd she's programmed from a young age to never ever question any of it? It sounds soul-crushing.\n\nAs it stands, you have an impassable conflict, so one of you needs to change. And it basically needs to be her, because crying over made-up lies is not an ok way to live for either of you.\n\nThe kindest thing you can do for her is be her safe place to start removing this cancer from her brain.\n\nIn your position, I would first go to therapy myself, and then try to get her to go. If you don't have the money, you can read up on cults and deprogramming.\n\nYou can also read up on ethics. Sometimes getting people to explore the conflicts in their thinking can start them down that road. For example, her god is clearly willing to do evil things. \n\nSo what makes them god? \n\nMaybe she just worships a powerful monster?\n\nYou can check out street epistemology to see what I'm talking about. OBVIOUSLY you would be a lot gentler with her than the guys in the videos.\n\nShe's been taught to fear thinking for herself. I can't imagine a worse hell.\n\nShe needs help, hopefully she's ready to accept some.\n\nEdit: I would also NOT have sex with this person. The risk of pregnancy is simply unacceptable, IMO. A kid is for the rest of your life.",

Be calm, logical, and do not appear to contradict faith, as this sets your beliefs up as an adversary. Instead, start by introducing ideas as unopposed to Christianity-\n\nLove and tolerance for others and their beliefs. Remind her of religious syncretism between Christianity and other faiths throughout the history of Christianity. How often it was actually easy for early Christians to respect the beliefs of others and even confer with them on religious matters. How is a person of a different faith different from an atheist (to Christian doctrine? Not at all).\n\nThe heart of this is the idea that God damns non-believers for all eternity. Firstly, the idea of eternal damnation is not featured in early Abrahamic faith and may very well be a product of human revision to the original beliefs (its significantly easier to get medieval people more in line if God's punishment is eternal). Introduce the Problem of Hell, and ask if a God can be just and doling out infinite suffering at the same time.\n\nBasically, slowly raise religious philosophical questions in a friendly manner that accepts the Christian framework, then work from there.",

      "text": "There are two options. And only two. And none of them are a quick fix.\n\nOne is the most mentioned one in the thread: leave her. There is no way this ends well if things keep going as they are. You will have constant problems. She will never stop trying to convert you and the ones around you and that sort of irrational thinking always conflicts with reality with time.\n\nThe other option is **deprograming**. \n\n  \nYou will have to pull her out of the cult she is in. This takes time, effort, knowledge, training and has to be on your mind 24/7. It will become all of what you do in your free time from now until she is out, which can take anywhere from 2 to 7 years. And it might not even work.\n\nMy opinion is you are better off finding someone mentally healthy and not indoctrinated and spending that time and effort making them and yourself happy.\n\nBut Ill tell you how to do it none the less. Because it should be your choice.\n\nI was successful in deprograming a friend of mine and it took 2 hours of my day 3 days a week for 5 years.   \nHe was in a weak cult, with few members and none of his family members supported his place in the cult. Which makes things substantially easier.\n\nShe is currently indoctrinated into the young earth creationism cult (YEC) due to 2 things: 1) she doesnt know enough about the world to understand why its preposterous, and 2) she is misinformed about how the world works.  \nThe entire process is based on several steps in this order:  \n1) To educate her about basic facts about nature  \n2) To bring her to rethink about certain facts she was misinformed on, while continuing to feed her information  \n3) To confront her about her overall beliefs  \n\n\nShe is in a so called \"epistemic closure\" situation. In a mental trap that has her justify her beliefs through her beliefs and which denies information outside of the cult as false.  \nUsually in the form of \"The Devil made him say it\". Its circular reasoning at its finest.   \nThe closure can never be complete, otherwise she wouldnt be functional and you use these small \"holes\" to feed her information.   \nUse normal conversations to smuggle in some information, some knowledge. Make it casual, like it interests you and you want to share it. Or simply reciting a fact connected to the issue you are talking about...  \n\n\nThe type of information Im talking about has three spheres:  \n1) Introspective skills and emotional understanding  \n2) Logical thinking and defining evidence  \n3) Factual knowledge  \nShe has been conditioned to ignore logic, she doesnt understand logic or the concept of evidence and has an overwhelming trust gap between you and her pastor/cult central member which you need to bridge. She also doesnt know basic elementary school things which you need to teach her.  \nThe first sphere is factual knowledge. She has a wall of misinformation making her think her YEC belief is real. To shatter only that is simple: you would need evidence to the contrary. But this layer is protected her being misinformed on what evidence is and what logic is.  \nUsually if I show you a clinical trial on the effectiveness of a vaccine this is evidence enough for rational people. But for her the concept of a clinical trial is so distant that she cant possibly understand what it means - which is why her cult could have implanted the idea that atheists and scientists are in a war with them trying to do the devils bidding and get her away from god. I changed my friends mind because I am a scientists, and I showed him what I do, explained it by casually talking about my day and answering his questions. But to even start explaining what are different types of evidence, that personal experience isnt evidence and why its not, you need to help her understand logic.  \nLogic is messy to make people understand Because bad logic will be hardcoded into us, its the base OS we work on every day. You weigh all your decisions based on the logical apparatus in your head. You need to find places her behavior clashes with logic and suggest corrections. This is something that will be hard to approach on if she doesnt ask willingly because of the last and final barrier - you need to learn her introspection and emotional awareness.   \nShe will not debate you, question herself or allow new ideas into  her head unless she literally \"feels like it\". The setting must be positive, she must feel like she is the one asking questions, like she is doing all the thinking - which she will once you teach her how to.  \nShe has a strong emotional bond to her faith and you need to either sever that or teach her how to dissociate from the emotion and think rationally. Which she wont easily do because her entire worldview is held the strongest here. It stems from here - the emotion the belief giives her.  \nSever it or find a way to work around it.   \n\n\nThe last part  of the puzzle is not necessary but helps: isolate her from the enablers of her beliefs. If her parents, pastor or screen time fortify her beliefs make sure to keep her as far away as possible from them. Not by kidnaping her or something but by always having errands  and activities you convince her are necessary and positive. Usually charity work is best. She will feel like you are a good person (despite being an atheist, which she sees as evil), and she will feel like she is helping people. Spoil her with dates and fun activities, just so she can be more with you and less with fanatical scripture. Etc.  \n\n\nConstantly feed her facts, ideas, concepts, knowledge, puzzles... make her brain work and reward her for thinking each time. I rewarded my friend by giving him attention and by talking to him about something he really wanted to know and was the crux of our relationship - my knowledge of meditation.   \nTake your time, dont come off as pushy. Slowly take her back.",

Eventually my girlfriend stopped believing in Christianity and both of our lives improved 100%. But I know for a fact if she hadn't I would have ended the relationship. There was too much of a contrast between believes especially when it consumes a person.\n\nI'm not religious, although I grew up catholic but even as a kid I was always creeped out by it and always thought what on earth are we doing.

It was some heavy projection on his part for sure, but those families just aren\u2019t stable. His dad met his mom when she was super young (as he told it, she was an atheist when they met). I swear the way he told the story sounded exactly like his dad brainwashed his mentally unstable mom, and then proceeded to knock her up constantly. He was one of eight kids, and she had four miscarriages besides those. I actually feel super sorry for that whole family, because the dad has control of most of them. My ex really could have gotten out, but that brainwashing runs deep.",

We share a dark sense of humor.  We both like to create things.  We enjoy spending time together, but don't mind spending time apart.  We have our own friends and shared friends.  And we often joke about \"sharing the same brain.\"  We can disagree, but we never fight or even raise our voices.\n\nWhat I'm saying is that it took me a long time to realize that, while compromise is necessary from time to time, relationships shouldn't be ALL work.  The examples of marriage from mine and previous generations is that each \"puts up\" with the other.  It's an antiquated idea and its time has passed for most.  Millennials and post-millennials don't bag on their significant others like previous generations.  You don't marry someone with the idea of \"changing\" them.\n\nBut there are some hold-outs.  And they're largely of the religious variety.  Your girlfriend is hanging on, thinking she's going to change you.  Her crying may be genuine, but it sounds manipulative.  And, not for nothin', but you have FUNDEMENTAL differences in how you view the world around you that affects social, political and moral issues.\n\nYou need to walk away.  Breaking up is hard and, as humans, we love habits and don't like to break them.  Relationships are a whole cluster of habits.\n\nBut I'm telling you, from my personal experience, having a relationship with someone who is not only like-minded, but a great friend, is just worth searching out.",

I don't mind having religious people/friends in my circle, but I *would* mind having *stupid* religious people in my circle.",

They may have convinced her that her only alternative to an eternity of torture is to leave you immediately or sacrifice her immortal soul to Satan. So she makes sure you can hear her grief and turns on the waterworks.\n\nWelcome to religious manipulation by the greedy and used on the gullible.\n\nMy suggestion: Tell your girlfriend that you'll attend services with her and talk to her spiritual leaders about converting IF AND WHEN she -- or they -- can provide testable, repeatable evidence that their beliefs are true and their god is real. \n\nHer theatrics make it very likely that the issue will become a thorn in your relationship.

Growing up Pentecostal really does a number on your mind. Even after being out for 15 years, I still have anxiety and trauma to work through.\n\nPentecostals are taught in graphic detail what hell will be like, and small children are not spared those details. Things I was taught in Sunday School could probably get me banned from Reddit if I posted it here. Children are taught that they have to behave according to the church's teachings, or they could come home from school and find their parents gone, all the people they know from church gone (which is everyone they are taught are safe and trustworthy), and the child will be left on their own in a world of heathens. This is called \"the rapture.\" The level of control via fear is insane, and it really messes people up bad. Your girlfriend crying about it is actually a pretty normal response given what she's been through.\n\nBecause the Pentecostal faith is so toxic, it tends to drive a lot of people off. For whatever reason, retention is better for young women than it is for young men. This means that all the young men in the church get snapped up by girls with high social standing, and girls with less social standing are left to either convert themselves a husband, or to live a lonely life. Given that she's dating an atheist, I assume your girlfriend has less status in her church. And, ironically, her dating you reduces her standing more. The others in her church will perceive her as \"struggling\" and \"in danger\" because of her relationship with you, and they will provide \"support\" in the form of an intense pressure campaign.\n\nYour girlfriend is no doubt experiencing sermons targeted at her, people randomly approaching her to express concern, and people randomly publicly praying for her - all to pressure her into complying with the church instead of leaving the Pentecostal faith. While her status in the group is taking a beating right now, if she succeeds in converting you, her status will skyrocket. And Pentecostal religion is more about status than anything else.\n\nSo what should you do about it? That's far more complex to answer. The easy answer is that you two are not compatible. Right now, that is true. However, we don't know what quiet doubts she has, or if she has done any deconverting at all. If she's deep in it and won't come out, then this relationship is already over unless you convert. But if you are at least able to salvage a friendship from it, you can gently push her to ask questions over the years. And she may eventually deconvert. It's impossible to say at this point how she'll respond.\n\nBest of luck, OP. You're going to need it. And if you have any questions about things that come up, you can head over to r/ExPentecostal. We'll be happy to do what we can to help.",

Why couldn't I just \"change?\"  She tried to sleep with me, I refused to have sex with her (or anyone) for 6 months to give her time to grieve and separate her stuff from mine..\n\nIn the end, she become spiteful and sued me, we agreed on divorce terms, then volunteered to print it and changed one sentence from \"our retirement accounts are separate\" to \"our retirement accounts will be separated after the divorce is finalized\" which I didn't notice because I was trying to be \"nice\" and just handle things.  It cost me about $50k and ultimately blocked me from buying a house after I sold my house which during the pandemic resulted in me being homeless for 4 months which cost me another $30k of hotel expenses.\n\nNot sure how all of that fits in with her religious views, but it taught me to never put up with that kind of emotional manipulation from the \"religious\" again.",

The alternative to eternal life is perishing, not another much less pleasant eternal life. That's all it ever says in the Bible. Satan and his demons will burn in the lake of fire because they are already immortal. We don't survive the lake of fire because we aren't. It's right there in the Bible, plain as day, multiple times, and yet Christians just ignore it because they need this made up concept of hell to spook them into being better people. If eternal life is the reward, how would it make sense that an alternative eternal life would be the punishment? \n\nThere is no hell. There is no eternal damnation. Even if God is real, atheists will still get exactly what they expected all along. They will cease to exist. Or maybe they even go to heaven because God is all merciful and forgiving, who knows? But they definitely don't go to hell.",

Sure you can talk and be in that stage before you really get to know each other; but once things start to get serious, that\u2019s when you need to have that talk. If you don\u2019t have those kinds of talks and evaluation, that\u2019s only going to lead to bigger problems like this and possible resentment of why your partner isn\u2019t \u201cperfect\u201d like you originally thought. Like many others have said, this is a big talk to you NEED to have if this is going to work out. Not only because of marriage (will you get married in a church? will she convince you to convert? etc.), but if you do have kids, how will they be raised? I know that this talk will be scary, but if your partner isn\u2019t willing to at least accommodate and hear you out, \u201clet the kids chose a religion when they\u2019re ready,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to be married in a church,\u201d etc. Then she might not be the one for you. These core values are essential for both of your futures, you might as well clear up things and save yourselves from further heartbreak or heal the misconceptions. Best of luck!",

She cannot \"save\" you and you owe it to her to be honest about that, because you know it is her intention. It sounds to me that not only are you not likely to change your belief, but that you also don't *want* to change your belief.\n\nThere will be some tears, probably for you as well as her, but once she fully understands the situation she can either accept the situation and continue to have a relationship with you, or break up with you. \n\nIf you care for her, then you can treat her well with this. You frame it not that she's wrong, but simply state your intentions--which is that you intend to remain with your current belief system. If that is a deal-breaker, so be it. \n\nOf course, if you aren't particularly concerned about being sincere or you don't mind the idea of actually being a Christian, you can just convert and I'm sure she'd like that very much.",

And that may never happen because a lot of people love feeling chosen as special by a force beyond their understanding, and are afraid of the possibility that maybe nothing happens when we die, no matter what life we lived. \n\nAnd this is the thought process of a religious man who believes in God.

First person up was an old woman that said she was watching a faith healer on TV and she KNEW he was addressing her and her shoulder. BUT, satan was there and he took control of the other arm and switched the channel. BUT Jesus stepped in and changed it back and an epic fight broke out switching channels. Jesus won. She was able to put her on on the TV and the faith healer fixed her shoulder (why Jesus couldn't do it while he was there is a mystery). I realized nobody was laughing and I was in trouble.\n\nThat is your future. Best to leave her now.\n\nAnd you're wrong. Thinking the planet is 10,000 years old and evolution is \"just a theory\" affects our lives every day. It means these people are missing basic critical thinking skills and do not accept facts that disagree with their FAITH. These are the religious zealots that are pushing this country to be ruled under sharia law.",

He said, \u201chow could you murder my baby?!\u201c I said, \u201cdon\u2019t take it personally, it\u2019s nothing against you, I\u2019d murder anyone\u2019s baby.\u201d And so it began. \n\nHe believed evolution was a \u201ctool of satan,\u201d and he bitched at me every time I took him to a natural history museum, he believed that Noah\u2019s Ark was real, the rapture would occur soon and that the only way to save your soul from eternal damnation was to accept Jesus into your heart and pray the sinners prayer. About three weeks after we started sleeping together, he asked me \u201cwhen we would be getting married?\u201d Like we were already dragging our feet. I told him I would never get married, because it was just a patriarchal system to oppress women, and I would never have children, as the world was already overpopulated and we were destroying the climate with fossil fuels. He told me he couldn\u2019t be with a girl who wasn\u2019t saved. He broke up with me and moved out of my apartment. \n\nFor three days he prayed and for three days I chain-smoked and drank and listened to gospel music because it reminded me of him. Then he came back and said, \u201cI realized that even if you burn in hell for eternity, I only want to spend this life with you\u201d \n\nI gave in on the marriage part, and stuck to my guns on the kids part. The plus side of not having children is, you can argue about abortion or the Bible or both for half the night and not bother anyone. \n\nIt\u2019s a crazy life, and people believe all sorts of crazy things, but if you are madly-out-of-control-in-love with a Zealot, I say, follow your heart. \n\nAlso, sex with Pentecostals is the best, these are people who are willing to roll around on the ground and shout in \u201cheavenly languages\u201d in front of a church full of people. Repression is hot.",

I'm married to a very science-minded guy and the first couple years there was a lot of debate about creationism vs evolution. I still had that mentality like your girlfriend.

You may be able to convince her that if God exists and he's good and worthy of worship, he would not torture good people for eternity. So being good, treating others right, being responsible for one's actions, etc, should be much more important than whether one simply believes in God or not, whether a God that's good exists or not.\n\nYou could also ask her is she thinks bad people go to heaven if they believe in God. If the criteria is believing in God, that sounds more like a narcissistic God that would not be worthy of worship. Evil people could do all kinds of harm in life, express belief, and then go to heaven.\n\nUnderlying all that is the issue that her God concept is vindictive and authoritarian, as opposed to nurturing, kind and loving. Different sects land at different points in that spectrum, with Pentecostals certainly being towards the former. Even without changing her mind about God's existence, you can help to shift her conception of God to one that is less harmful to yourself, herself and others.\n\nA lot of advice will be to break up with her. But you are the best judge of whether she is moving towards a more rational worldview. People can become much more rational and reasonable unpredictably, but the reverse is also true.",

There's not much for you to DO, here, except get comfortable with the fact that you probably need to let her go. \n\nThis ain't a religion. We don't convert or evangelize. So you've got no business convincing her out of her beliefs, mostly because it's not going to work very well. She likewise has no business convincing you. As many have already pointed out, it's just kind of crazy when you're just dating, but once real shit decisions enter the picture, like kids, and how to raise them, this gets much worse, and it's not gonna be workable. \n\nPeople have to meet halfway on stuff like this. That is, an atheist might be able to get along okay with a Wiccan, your Pentecostal might be able to make a life with a Baptist or other believer, but the two of you are waaaaay too far apart, here. \n\nThis is a classic noob error. You though maybe the power of love or something would prevail, but uh, that only goes so far. \n\nThe longer you drag this out, the worse it gets. Also, it's um, not a great time to be super yoked up to a very, very religious girl and her family, you might want to be real mobile in this coming decade. \n\nSo yeah, it's time to end this, and find your way to break up. \n\nEveryone craps on Redditors for always saying that, but y'all keep coming at us with basket cases, idk.",

Trust me, they will always be trying to \"fix\" you, and when there's nothing to be fixed, it leads to a lot of anxiety, sadness, and conflict that cannot be reconciled.

Slowly though, she wanted me to go with her to church every now and again, then more often... and then one day, she tried to prod me to go forward with others during some kind of revival, where people would go forth to accept Jesus or whatever.  And I wouldn't do it.  I don't believe.  I didn't mind going with her to church, any more than going clothes shopping with her.  But I wasn't about to make any claims about accepting her faith when I knew it to be a lie.\n\nThis was the end of our relationship.  She had accepted my atheism only because she believed she could get me to \"see the light\" and accept her faith for myself.\n\nIt's not going to work for your either, and there is no \"happy middle ground\".  If she's this devout, she will never accept your atheism, and it's just as unfair for you to try changing her.  This will be a sticking point that, over time, will only drive each of you farther and farther apart.",

As in, goes to church every week, plus additional religious events on the calendar?\n\nThe question in my mind is how much of her religion infiltrates your daily lives, and what that means if you're going to have a future together. As others have suggested, having the kids conversation is probably going to give you all the direction you need.\n\nI was raised Christian (Anglican) until I decided before my teens that I just didn't believe. I'm a person who puts stock in evidence and fact, rather than stories and beliefs.\n\nMy wife was raised Catholic. She's not a practicing Catholic, but she still believes. Before we had our daughter (and eventually got married), we had the kids conversation.\n\nI drew the line at religious indoctrination (eg. Catholic schooling) but was happy for her to have our daughter christened in the Catholic church. Hell, I even stood up there for the whole show. No skin off my back and, fortunately, I didn't burst into flames when I crossed the threshold.\n\nThe key outcome of the chat was that we both agreed we would encourage critical thinking in our daughter; that we would honestly and truthfully share our respective views on religion if/when she asked; and that neither of us would attempt to change her mind if she decided one way or the other.\n\nIf your girlfriend can't even agree to that middle ground, then you have the answer you're looking for.",

This will be pretty easy to do once it happens. If you die before judgement day you will sleep in your grave and be risen on judgement day one way or the other. Once you're \"in\" the afterlife you aren't going to deny anything. Unless you see Jesus face to face and still say religion is stupid and he killed babies for no reason, which would be hella bad ass.

I thought we were a good couple who could have our own different beliefs...she didn't.  If I was going to remain an atheist, she couldn't be with me, so she broke up with me.

If your being an atheist is a belief that if paramount in your life, and her faith is the same for her, then I do not believe there is a way to make this work. My mother cared so much about converting my dad and my dad didn\u2019t care, which my mother saw as indifference and a lack of respect for her faith/god. My dad saw my mothers constant nagging about this issue as a sign that he was not good enough for her as he was and he grew to resent not only her, but her faith as well.  Look, you are never going to find a partner that that you agree with everything on. The key is to find someone whose most important beliefs match yours. Those are the things you simply cannot compromise on because they form the foundation of who you are. For some it\u2019s politics, or religion. Others social issues, money, etc. Whatever it is that you decide to do about your relationship with you girlfriend, please have some compassion and show her some grace. She has been deeply indoctrinated with this stuff to the point where she is unable to see any other point of view out of fear for her soul. It\u2019s like being in a cult. Hell, Christianity is a cult. I say this as someone who was raised in a Pentecostal church and once believed all the hateful rhetoric I was taught. It is possible to grow and learn and change, but it\u2019s a slow process. Be patient with her, and if you really love her (and more importantly, if you love yourself) then you will gently end the relationship if you see no other way to work through this issue. You both deserve to be happy and with a partner that supports and understands the importance of the beliefs you hold most dear.",

As she is crying herself to sleep over your well-being I'm assuming she also cares for you.\n\nHowever, if you want to stay together, you will need to agree on some major points and agree to  disagree on others. Major points: i) nobody knows what happens after one dies - not the elders at her church, not her holy book, not her and not you ii) if being in the right church were sufficient to get into heaven, then the parable of the good samaritan vs the pharisees makes no sense iii) if god is just, then a life well spent on this earth will be rewarded. If god does not exist, then a life well spent on this earth is reward in itself.\n\nIf you can agree on these points, then hopefully she will start focusing on the present rather than the distant and unknown future. However, as others have pointed out, this is but one of the challenges you will face when dealing someone with a fundamentalist belief system. Focus on being the best person you can be, and with a bit of luck she will come to realize one does not need an old book to know how to be a good person.",

It took a few years, but she was able to break the hold religion had over her, after getting out of her childhood home. I was part of that process - I believe she needed someone willing to have the necessary conversations.\n\nShe deconverted in dramatic fashion. One night she brought me into the woods by the college, where she burned the pages of her personal Bible, in which she had written all these notes about what a terrible person she was, based on scripture.\n\nA deconversion in her 20s was traumatic. She needed a lot of therapy. She needed support I couldn't give her. Eventually it led to a breakup.\n\nOP, I do think you should consider leaving this relationship. But you *could* attempt deconversion if you think she's susceptible. I don't know her, of course, but if she's dating you in spite of your atheism, and sleeping with you, the cracks in her faith may already be there. But recognize that there's a very difficult art to attacking beliefs without attacking the person.",

Lots of Christians in the US believe in evolution.\n\nWhy I'm bringing this up is that this creationism stuff might mean more than just a single belief. It may mean a very specific cluster of beliefs - and not just beliefs but ways of thinking. Beliefs regarding politics, or authority, or conformity - it may particularly have some implications on doubling down. Are you OK with that? \n\nAs for what you can tell your girlfriend - I'm going to tell you what I usually tell people whenever the question of faith comes up. I approach this from a secular and a Christian point of view. Secularly - the definition of faith is belief without evidence. To believe conditionally on the existence of evidence is not compatible with faith. \n\nI am not saying that belief despite evidence is faith - I am saying that the logical construction of God as presented by the Bible just so happens to be in this special configuration where the entire point is that there is no evidence - nor will there be evidence. If you do not believe in God, but rather believe that the Bible is a meme - I'd say that this logical construction is probably why this meme has been able to survive for so long. \n\nNow, from a Christian point of view - the Bible says that faith is a thing that is given by God. As for whether or not this means people have any conscious decision in believing is [one of those things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monergism) that differentiates different types of Christianity. You could tell your girlfriend that maybe it is the case that in the future, God will give you faith. Even if you don't believe now, who knows - even from a secular point of view, we know that people seriously change throughout their lives from events and experiences that no one can anticipate. \n\nAll in all though, consider this: go to her church with her. I'm not saying this in a \"try out Christianity\" way. I mean this as in - relationships are all about sacrifice. Clearly, this issue is upsetting your girlfriend. If you care about her, you'd be willing to do things for her sake. If you went to her church - even if you didn't believe in God, or ever believed in God, or ever told anybody there that you believed in God - this would still probably ease her distress. You may not believe in God, but you'd do it because you believe in your love for her.\n\nDo you think you'd be able to handle that? If not, maybe the relationship just isn't meant to be.",

      "text": "Completely normal man, she grew up differently. Her religion is going to be apart of her and her daily routines. Probably for the rest of her life, specially if she feels her relationship with God will always be there. I grew up in a Pentecostal household for 18 years. Let me tell you. There are always two types of Pentecostal church going kids. The ones that fakes it to make it and the die hards that abides by every rule willingly and happily because it\u2019s been programmed into their lives since birth. At an early age I understood that speaking in \u201ctongues\u201d wasn\u2019t something natural. I felt it was fake, I felt that it was. I never portrayed myself to ever speak in tongues, everybody looked down on me. You can hear it in someone\u2019s speech. Went to church camps, church goings, great people. Nice people, but everything seemed a little fake to me. Im ranting but what I will say is she will always put god first. God will always be in the middle of the relationship. That\u2019s how her idea of it will always work because that\u2019s how a perfect Pentecostal church relationship will work. Put God first, in everything. In A relationship, God will always be there. If you can accept that, and move forward accepting that. Even at some point going with her to church, that being a high possibility. Then move forward, but any centimeter of thinking you can extend this out or move forward with her without getting involved at some point. Divorce is inevitable, and the relationship will eventually fail. Save the heartache for the both of you. Find someone that thinks like yourself, or one that isn\u2019t so sheltered.",

I explained things to ky husband,  who thankfully felt the same.\n\nSo, my suggestion is to sadly leave. She has deep rooted beliefs that will likely not change.

But because if at some point you end up having children you can bet she will insist on raising them religious, even if you don\u2019t want to. She will take them to church and 100% indoctrinate them against you, because even if you are a perfect father and/or partner, you are \u201cgoing to hell\u201d. If you divorce/break up then she\u2019ll still have at least partial custody of the kids and give them the religious education she wants. \n\nThat\u2019s if you have kids, but even if you don\u2019t, can you imagine your whole life knowing you are with someone who will always consider you less than just because you don\u2019t believe (or feign belief in) her bid daddy in the sky? And if you are honest with yourself: do you not think her less than perfect for believing whatever they told her?",

      "text": "Wife was this way when we met. Not quite year filled conversations, but close. She was raised in a church that her uncle started. I don't remember the denomination it was attached to, Pentecostal sounds right, but I get it wrong every time it comes up, so I doubt that's right.\n\nAnyway, she was VERY concerned about me going to hell, and us going to church and, we'll, basically all the same things you're describing. She didn't know dinosaurs existed until college, she didn't think she had some very basic relationship rights until sheet me at 28. Previous relationships had all been from the same social/church/community circles and those guys had similar views as her.\n\nI'm not full on atheist, I have some belief in a higher power. I also think the church has some really good things (charity, community, moral compass guidance if you're WAY off track, and others). I also despise a great deal of organized religion (money problems, fear and guilt imposition, indoctrination of kids, and others). So, we might not have been quite as far apart as you are with your significant other right now.\n\nIt's taken YEARS and LOTS of open and honest conversations to find a happy middle ground. She's seen that I'm not a bad person and that most people aren't bad people. She's reconciled that we're not all destined to carry around that guilt of being an inherently flawed being, and that science (at large) has some great benefits. We've also shaped some thoughts of \"God will save us from this problem\" with the understanding of \"He's saving you by putting this person or thing in your life as a resource, he's not going to save you by coming down and performing a miracle\". It's been a long road on that front, but it was never a deal breaker for us from the start, although it was close in the first year or so.\n\nMy advice is to have an open and honest conversation with her. Listen and HEAR her side and her thoughts and position. She's had people telling her these things very likely since she was born. You're not going to change the tide in a single conversation, a week, or even a year. You have to understand where she is, and then show by example that you're still a good person despite not holding these beliefs she has.\n\nTwo things have to exist for this to work out. She has to be open to listening and accepting. You have to be patient and willing to compromise at some levels.\n\nFor us that's things like talking about bible stories with the kids. It's a disservice to them to live in a Christian centric community and them NOT know about things like Jonah and the whale, or why Easter and Christmas are full of religious symbols. They don't have to be converted, indoctrinated or otherwise guided, but they should be aware. We also use the local Church to find volunteer opportunities. They need to know why everyone at those events prays before and after they do anything. How to act during a prayer to be respectful, and how to disagree with that act, but not be disruptive or rude.\n\nBig picture here.....from my seat....you can make it if you're willing to put in the work from both sides and you're both willing to compromise a little.\n\nGood luck!",

Depending on her beliefs, it may help her understand that the best thing she can do is continue with her beliefs, and pass on the \"good word of God\". If she cannot understand that, I feel you may have some problems in the relationship. I am not saying you guys cannot work through them, nor that either of your will make it a toxic relationship, but make sure to check yourself and make sure your not trying to hard for something that simply is not working.",

If she cries at night worrying about your eternity that's a woman who loves you.  Sounds like you better marry her. If you don't like her church find one yall can both go to.

Your satanic, evolution belief system takes greater faith than one of creation by a higher power. You deny your Creator because you hate the implication of what that means. If a Creator exists, then someone other than you can make the rules for life. If that's true, then there are consequences for doing the things that you want to do, but are sin, according to said Creator. Sin is bad for you; your mental and physical well being, relationships with other people, and much more. It's destructive behaviour. You love your sin more than you love your Creator or even yourselves. That's why you believe the lies of evolution, and nothingness, and abide in your sin, even to your own destruction. It's better than believing in the fact that, if you choose not to believe that you are separated from your Creator, who loves you, and provides reconciliation with Him, but requires it on HIS terms, and not your own, that you will be eternally lost, separated from everything that is good, and no one will even remember that you ever existed.",

It's kind of like hating your job but it pays well, at some point you'll crack.

Is this just some weird thing she does or is it going to be central to your relationship?  If you get married where will that marriage take place?  If it's in a church are you okay with that?

So if you had some reason to think she is wanting to change, there may be a reason to stay but seeing that she is waaaaaayyyyy deep in the Kool aid you are just wasting your time. Yes she does need someone to drag her into reality but that person is her. That you know she does this is either some theater to make you feel some way or some emotional ploy to make you join her religion. Which is manipulation. It is. It isn't cute. It's manipulation to make you be as religious as she is which is your choice and not hers. If she cannot respect your religion or religious less views she isn't the one. Also someone who doesn't believe in science isn't the person to raise kids with. You can just cut the shit now or bring her to court because you want your kids to be vaxxed so they can go to regular school.",

Yes, but it will be a LOT of work. Question is, do you love her enough to put that work in? Thats ultimately the main question. \n\nSecond question, where did you guys even meet? I imagine with her upbringing, you probably didn't meet in church or something! Unless you were religious yourself when you got together? \n\nPersonally, like when I'm doing online dating, (not sure if you met her there) but my rule of thumb is an instant swipe-left if I see anything that hints that she's medium-to-highly religious. A little \"spiritual\" is not bad, it can be dealt with rationally. But you, you my friend are dealing with someone that has their core belief rooted in irrationality.

There's nothing you can really do here if she's giving no leeway on what she thinks. Especially with modern Christianity, \"attacks\" on the faith is likely to just push them further in. To be honest what brought me back out is all the horrible BS Christianity is doing to people right now... and for hundreds of years.\n\nThe best you can really do is just be a fantastic representative of being a non Christian, do good things, be moral, don't be snarky. If she sees non Christians being more representative of what it is to be Christ like than self professed Christians maybe she'll begin to think about things as I did, then she'll no longer have to cry about you going to hell.",

It sucks, but if its causing her so much distress that she's crying herself to sleep over it, I don't think its gonna pan out.\n\nI had a much less drastic, but similar experience with my first girlfriend. She was a very devout Christian, I (despite being raised by and around clergy) was very much agnostic-leaning-atheist. While that difference wasn't what caused us to break up (it was a long distance deal and she ended up cheating on me. A lot) looking back I can tell that it was never going to work with us anyway. While partners don't have to have identical metaphysical beliefs, they do need to be able to understand and accept the differences in those beliefs without it causing strife. Your girlfriend clearly can't do that, and the suffering its causing her is just going to fester over time. Best to let end now and let both of you start looking for a relationship that is more compatible with your fundamental beliefs.",

My gf said that was fine she wouldn't force me but that the kids would definitely learn that I would be going to hell and she and they would not. That's when I realized we were completely incompatible. I couldn't be part of a situation where my own kids would have to deal with the confusion of being taught someone they loved deeply (me hopefully) was doomed to something horrible and that it was something for them to fear happening to them too. My gf couldn't understand why it was such a big no from me on this point. We broke up over it. Long way to say, get the fuck out now, you two are fundamentally incompatible so long as she believes you are going to hell simply for your beliefs not your actions.

We would debate vigorously on scripture and I can still say I believe in the Bible, however I grew to the point that I have to come to my own conclusions and reconcile what I was taught vs what I learned from what I was taught and how I now understand as an adult. \n\nBe patient. A lot of preachers in that community don\u2019t understand the impact they\u2019re making on their congregation. They have a beautiful faith, but often they preach apocalyptic messages to underscore the importance of belief without understanding. \n\nThe fear mainly comes from end times preaching. Perhaps watch \u201cleft behind\u201d and empathize with how that view can impact your life. \n\nI had a girlfriend as a teenager that I brought to church and she was so scared of what to me was normal that she steered clear of churches until later in life. I was taught \u201cit\u2019s better to marry than to burn\u201d and ended up getting married at 19 barely a year after breaking up with the girl I knew was the one for me. I stayed married for ten long years of internal suffering before my ex and I finally mutually separated. We\u2019re friends now and my experiences with her and her family who taught her to independently question and inquire on things helped me to move forward with my beliefs and challenged me to become who I am today and for that I\u2019m grateful. \n\nIm now with the girl who I already knew was the one for me and my life has been getting better. \n\nBe patient, be kind, and if she\u2019s right for you give her time. \n\nThat said, think about yourself also and carefully consider yours and her life and how/if you can reconcile your ideology and hers together. \n\nResearch the background of that faith, perhaps attend a few meetings (most have Sunday morning, Night, and mid week services) to gain an understanding of what her specific church is teaching her. Each service is different. Sunday morning is usually Bible study and is more mild. Night there\u2019s typically a long music service that can be intense, a sermon that may knock your socks off or make your hairs raise, and an alter call. The alter calls are usually very emotionally pleading. Mid week services are typically Bible study and are less intense. \n\nMy grandfather was on the board of directors for the UPCI and was considered very Liberal (ironic considering how conservative politically he was) and also radical in his ideas. He was one of the main reasons for pastors being allowed to have televisions in their homes.",

Any relationship at all is strained when that's the case. After years and years of not speaking to my mother she finally got the idea and doesn't usually talk religion to me. But she still sneaks it in occasionally because she just can't help herself. It's her belief that she will be in heaven and ill be in hell for not believing in Christianity. It's not just atheism either because she'd say the same thing if say I became a Muslim or a Buddhist. Anything less than faith in christ damns me to an eternity of misery and torture. It's frustrating and I have to shut it down as soon as it happens otherwise it turns into a fight. Even though she seems to have gotten the hint, it's still a huge strain on my relationship with her. \n\nI also dated a woman who I was crazy about. Like if you talk about ones that got away she was it. But it would never have worked because she is a huge believer in her faith. And on top of that had a child already, whom she raised Christian. It wasn't a huge deal at the time because we were young but it wouldn't have worked in the long run. I am ok with that. I'd never ask someone to change their beliefs to appease me. \n\nYou have 2 options. Try to make it work, amd get ready for a tough road ahead. Or break up which ultimately may end up happening anyway eventually. Tell her if she goes to heaven then she will be incapable of feeling pain or sadness, even if you end up in hell. According to their beliefs thats how it works. It may make her feel better and open up a way to compromise. But in the end these issues are gonna make it hard for the rest of your lives together.",

      "text": "How in the hell are you even making a relationship like this work? I mean I could date someone who is like loosely religious or just believes that there is a god, but I really don't think I could date someone who denies science and reason to this extreme. I guess as and alternative example would be like a person who believes everything in the world is made of plastic. Clearly its not, we have observations right in front of us that clearly tell otherwise and the idea that everything is plastic makes not sense. I would be her friend ya sure, but dating her?  I don't want to bash her because I understand how brainwashing some religious households can be so it isn't necessarily her fault for why she is like this. If anything she is a victim but I just dont think I could take that kind of task on with someone who is supposed to be  complimentary to me. \n\n\"What am I supposed to do here?\"\n\nUh.....I just doesn't work here. My first thought is break up with her, however I know people don't like doing that so my second advice would be to get her to see reason. Don't take away god entirely that can end up messing people up is some pretty nasty ways. I guess slowly get her weened onto science. Start with basic stuff that she won't notice is contradicting her beliefs and slowly work your way through until it easier for her to process more challenging ideas. teacher her about chemistry in general maybe. When you start to get into half-life get into how we can accurately measure how old things are she will start to accept this new information because she actually  understands how it works. \n\nYou basically need to plant the seed of curiosity in her and you need to teach her logic and reason. She never had that because her parents brainwashed her. She doesn't care to learn and she doesn't really know how to learn. So this is where you have to start. Not to mention you are dealing with an already developed brain so you are basically walking though a mine field. She has foundations of belief and though, that she has to keep protected because that is all she knows. If she detects that you are threatening that in any way BOOOMMMM you stepped on a mine. she will shut you out more than she had before. That's why this transition has to be subtle and seem nonconflicting to her beliefs. Basically dance around the obvious explanations by just giving her easy to digest information until she comes to the conclusions on her own.\n\nDo not make it about trying to get her to stop believing in god. That is a big step that many people never make. Just try to get her to changer her perception of god. You want her to begin to understand reality in a way that the objectification, judgments and behaviors that she perceived god to have becomes silly and irrational.",

The only thing we assign as a law are mathematical proofs.  This means there is a theory of gravity that describes observed behavior and a law of gravity that shows how it works mathematically.  At this point we have so much evidence for evolution it isn't a debate.  We have many methods of dating to show how old the earth is, and yes this age does change but not by wild amounts.  The age of the universe is like this as well.  When I was in high school we were taught the universe post big bang is 12.5 to 15 billion years old.  I believe we have it somewhere in 13.7 billion range now, and while this will change it will only do so to become more precise.  We aren't going to say the universe is 20 billion years old tomorrow.\n\nYou could try to explain all that to her.  You could show her evidence and odds on she will never accept it, and I feel this will be a breaking point for you both at some point.  I would wager your relationship is heading in one direction because your core beliefs just aren't compatible.  I know the advice on every relationship issue on Reddit is always to break up but you really need to sit down and have a serious talk about the future of your relationship.  Where do you see yourselves a few years down the line?  How will you raise kids with such wildly different world views?  The things that aren't everyday issues will begin to creep more and more into your life in these cases.  You need to figure this out before you can truly build a life with someone though.",

Cause some people haven't been introduced to God properly, don't believe for whatever reason and so on and so on. So if you live by your conscience and are a good man you will not be destroyed by God and will be reincarnated. So you know if she is so big on religion really and not just trying to manipulate you into believing and living what and how she wants she will not cry again since her crying makes no sense from the Biblical standpoint. Hope that helps.\n\n\nAlso I am baffled with all these people claiming to be Christian, believing in God and not knowing basic rules from the Bible, who is teaching them this stuff? But everyone is big on quoting meaningless verses which standalone don't mean anything. Have a nice day.",

I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t possible to have a happy relationship if a couple has differing religions (or one has a religion and the other doesn\u2019t), but it is certainly a huge red flag. ESPECIALLY if those religions are diametrically opposed (such as in your case, when one member of the relationship thinks the other is going to Hell). This is something you can look up scientific research about. \n\nI\u2019d recommend having some serious conversations about this, because if you have no plans to convert, and she isn\u2019t open to the possibility of you either (a) abandoning her religion entirely or (b) converting to a different faith with less extreme views of non-members\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if you two can have a future together. At least, not a happy, long one. \n\nI come at this from the realm of a believer, BTW. I believe in Jesus Christ, and in Heaven and Hell, after a fashion. But I\u2019m also part of a Christian religion that believes there is more to the decision of Heaven vs Hell than meets the eye, and a loving God won\u2019t consign any of His children to Hell simply because they chose the wrong faith (or none) while on earth. I'd like to think has made me bit more open to workable relationships with non-believers than more radical Christians.",

Do you want your kids to be raised in a belief of something you don't believe at all? Since she believes that evolution is \"just a theory\" she will be teaching them that.   \n\n\nEven if you don't have kids, this belief of you going to hell is not going to go away over night, if at all. She truly believes that either due to something you are doing that is \"against the bible\" or just your lack of faith is going to send you to Hell. Unless her mindset about religion changes, she is not going to stop believing you are going to go to Hell, she is not going to stop feeling sad at the thought that the person she cares for is going to Hell. I deal with this with family members, it doesn't go away. They won't stop pushing since they truly believe they are doing what they can to \"save\" you from Hell.

She understands that every time she drops an object, it will fall to the ground. We have endless proof and support for it as well as the reality around us. The same goes for evolution unless you are taught not to look for it, which she has. I was deeply religious, and had similar issues. \n\nGetting out in the world more, meeting different kinds of people, that kind of thing helped. *But* I will say that one of the things that really started getting my brain going was a simple high school science book I'd checked out from the local small town library. I was a religious zealot, and had to homeschool myself, and learning how a simple pot of water boils changed my life. It was a simple explanation without frills, like a science text is. Something I hadn't gotten from the texts I had access to prior.   \n\nAlso, let's be very real here: Understanding these things *does* affect your every day life. It affects your ability to accurately understand the world around you. The world while I was religious was terrifying in part because everything was being looked at through a biblical lens. It's scary now still, but it makes way more sense. Every facet of our lives is shaped by science and the scientific method. If she truly wanted to eschew that then she should throw away her phone, her books, live outside and eat only uncooked food that hasn't been grown by farmers, and she can wear a simple woven cloth she makes herself. Like it or not, literally everything she touches has been made by the science she says she can't believe.   \n\nI also used to cry that my loved ones, and myself for never being good enough, were going to hell. When I became an atheist, at first I used to feel the, \"religious ignorance is bliss\" sentiment because when you're religious then you believe you and your loved ones go to heaven, right?\n\nBut you don't. You're constantly afraid they're going to hell. You're constantly afraid you're going to hell. You're constantly afraid. And confused. \n\nI realized, based on Carl Sagan's Cosmos, the simple properties of E = mc2, and the laws of thermodynamics that we are just bits of the universe constantly rearranging into new forms, learning about itself. We live together forever without the madness of remembering every single form we ever took. We're lucky in our own way even with oblivion and life's suffering. I say this as someone who is ill and constantly in pain. It is still beautiful and awesome, in the original sense of the word. \n\nYour girlfriend is living in a religious prison, and she is suffering. She convinces herself that religion makes her happy yet she cries herself to sleep every night because someone she loves is \"going to hell.\"\n\nThe only way this relationship will work is if she becomes an apostate. If she can't do that then it's probably best you break up. Would you want her to raise your kids? We need to look at religion in the modern world for what it is: a cult. Organized religion has no place in the modern world or any modern household. If you consider yourself a part of that, and she doesn't, then she needs to go.",

Yeah we all have heard stories about people getting married one being a jew and the other being catholic or some shit like that\u2026 but realistically, they are aligned in moral values where it counts. And its very important to align on these things especially when it comes to having or choosing not to have kids, how you will raise them\u2026 etc. these things absolutely matter. Its not really about what religion they are, its how they believe it, and whether or not you are on the same page. If not\u2026 its doomed to fail. \n\nAnd its not as though she wont change, she could\u2026 but its not likely to happen while you\u2019re together.

First, she's probably hearing sermons (especially if she's part of a \"singles group\") about how she's not supposed to be \"yoked to non believers.\" It may be that she's concerned about your eternal soul, but most likely she's starting to feel guilty about breaking the rule about dating \"sinners.\" To resolve this in her mind, her options are to either break up with you or get you to come to her side and join her cult.\nMy advice to you is to break up with her and let her go solo on her spiritual path, lest this conversation breed resentment between you two and tank the relationship/friendship. She may get out of this cult, she may not, but she doesn't need to take you along on her journey of guilt. Good luck to you both.",

I\u2019m sure she\u2019s truly a wonderful person but every time I\u2019ve met people that indoctrinated into their beliefs, it never ends well if they partner up with someone who doesn\u2019t share it. If you were Muslim and she Christian, ironically enough, braise tend to work because they squabble about their religions and try and convert the other their entire lives. It can be kind of cute, atleast when I\u2019ve seen it. However, you not being religious can be very offensive to their world view. \n\nThis relationship in my opinion is doomed to fail. If she\u2019s that wrapped up in what happens when you die, just try and imagine what life decisions in a marriage or raising children is going to bring. She will likely claim schools are indoctrinating the kids and want to pull them out, chances are she\u2019ll not want them vaccinated which is dangerous not only for the kids but those around them, the parents/grans (if still involved) will likely want to be heavily involved in religious upbringing, you\u2019ll have to bring them to church etc. and if any of this is pushed back on, you\u2019ll be in for a hell of a time. \n\nA good test would be to bring up the children question and see how she responds. Oddly enough it\u2019s a good way to gauge the future with someone even if kids are off the table. It shows you where they will be flexible or not in a dire situation.",

She married some dude her family introduced her to in church and from word of mouth, she seems to be miserable. The new guy apparently hits her and they have been seen constantly arguing in public  \ud83d\ude36\n\nIf she hadn't listen to what her family and church expected from her, she would've been a lot happier.

In other words, more than likely you aren't going to EVER reason her out of those trenches, let alone do it in a single sitting. \n\nAppeals based upon inference-- i.e. logic, reason, evidence-- will invariably cause her to double and triple down on her beliefs and emotional reasoning.    \n\nThe best, and perhaps only, thing you can do to help her is to ask her firm-yet-dispassionate questions that subtly press on the underlying illogic of her positions. Like her beliefs about hell. For example, ask her why she thinks physical fire torture of human beings is a moral form of retribution. Is it ever OK to torture people physically for wrongs they have committed? If it is morally  acceptable to physically torment humans for crimes they have committed, is there an ethical limitation to the duration which they should be punished? You can also mention the ancient religious concept of Lex Talionis -- which literally means *law of retribution*-- which is found first in Babylonian texts and then later in the Old Testament. This principle sets limits on the amount of retribution that can be exacted upon an offender and requires that punishment be proportional to the crime committed (i.e. \"an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\"-- NOT \"a *head* for an eye or an *arm* for a tooth\")\n\nAgain, these type of discussions serve only to open the remote possibility that your gf's moral and rational faculties be gently stirred and she begins to quietly question some of her conclusions. That's the best case scenario. The most likely scenario is that she is further hardened in her morally toxic religious ideas.\n\nThe fact that you hear her crying in bed, indicates that you already live together which is a clear violation of all established Christian tradition about sex and marriage. A much bigger problem for her belief system, IMO, if she is at all serious about her Christianity. You might want to ask how she squares the New Testament traditions with shacking up and getting railed by someone before marriage. That question right there might give the final push you need to move on with your life.",

Tell her that you would be willing to go church with her if she is ok with changing the denomination of church she goes to (They are all Christian denominations so its the same God and what have you, just different ceremonies and sermons). You should pick one that super mild with their religious rules/ceremonies compared to Pentescostal (Like Methodist, or Lutheran, or even Catholic to a lessor extent). This might even end up causing her to loose interest in going to church all together after a while because the less strict denominations are going to be so much different than what she is used to that it may cause a disconnect in her mind of needing to go to church, and the need to feel spiritually protected/fulfilled. \n\nIts not for everyone, (I understand why you wouldnt want to go to chruch lol) but hey, I thought Id throw out another suggestion for you. Hope everything works out as it sounds like you both like each other, normally a religious person and an atheist dont even try to settle their differences in a relationship.",

Her family is gonna resent you because you don't believe.  When I asked my wife's father for her hand in marriage he lectured me on how she is spiritual and needs to be supported in that.  Two years later I became atheist, and stopped going to church, which caused my wife to stop going as well. I'm 95% sure her mother (her father has since passed) resents me for getting her daughter out of religion.

Just break up now and avoid the other issues this is going to spawn.\n2. Ignore it, and hope neither of you grow to resent the other over it.\n3. Ignore it, until eventually one of you *will* resent the other enough to break up over it.\n\nI'd suggest trying to address her concerns first, but that's going to be a much bigger undertaking than you might expect. You might actually do better by looking into how to help people escape a cult and start there.\n\nBut as long as she believes in Hell, believes you're going there, and cares about you, she's going to be upset about it.\n\nIt is surprising to me that more Christians don't behave this way.",

I\u2019m you now, and I was her only a few years ago. \n\nThis sucks because I can imagine you love her very much, especially given you\u2019ve stayed with her through the times she\u2019s cried about your salvation and whatnot. I can also imagine you don\u2019t want to break up with her, as I\u2019d assume any person in a loving relationship would feel. \n\nThe downside is if this either turns into marriage or having kids, shit\u2019s only gonna get harder. I think a Christian and atheist can coexist if neither are on the extremist ends, and it unfortunately sounds like she\u2019s on the extreme end, especially if she speaks in tongues. I haven\u2019t read the comments, but I already know people have said she will want to raise your kids to believe what she believes. If you\u2019re lackadaisical about it and don\u2019t really care, then I think next step is to consider her own mental health in this, even though it\u2019s all self induced. I\u2019ve learned since leaving Christianity that my mom now will forever mourn my soul because I no longer believe, and goes to prayer groups with friends often and I know I\u2019m brought up. I\u2019m concerned for your girlfriend\u2019s wellbeing not because I think she\u2019s in the right, but because when I was in the faith, I was utterly wrecked if I was around someone who didn\u2019t believe. \n\nIn the end, I sadly feel like this isn\u2019t good for either of you. Take it or leave it, as I know no other details to your life. But I worry you\u2019ll grow increasingly frustrated as the years go on, and she will only drive further into fundamentalism and trying to convince you to believe what she does",

Seeing otherwise rational people completely lose their minds like that was just about the biggest turn offs I could imagine. I knew at that point I needed to break it off, because there was no way it was going to work. Obviously I don't know your exact situation, and I'm not going to tell you that you should break off your relationship because of a disagreement, albeit a pretty large one. But for me, that was the best option. I just knew early on that we weren't going to be compatible long-term. Even though I really liked her, moving on was the best thing I could have done.",

Jesus paid the fine, and by faith and trusting in him, your fine can be cancelled (the fine of death you had to pay).

For an animal to evolve to a higher level species, for example, that also means that their DNA would also have to change.  \n\nAs another example, it has been proven that apes have 99 percent of the DNA of a human, but it is that one percent that keeps them as apes. More contemporary theory is that each species evolved within the species, not to a higher order. \n\nOn a similar note, scientists have concluded that creating organic life fron inorganic materials is scientifically impossible. This relates to the theory that all life evolved from a primordial ooze on the edge of the ocean, that had the chemicals associated with DNA, but not the DNA itself.\n\nAs far as God, the faith community and the scientific community are starting to come together on the idea of \"intelligent design\".  That the miracle that is our earth could not have happened by accident, given all of the interdependent systems that must mesh perfectly for life to exist on this planet.  For example, did you know that if we did not have an ozone layer around the earth, life as we know it would not be possible. No other planet in our solar system has an ozone layer to diffuse sunlight!\n\nMy point is, in order for the two of you to have a satisfying relationship, both of you must keep your minds open to other possibilities, even a point of view with which you may not agree. Love calls for respect and tolerance.  Maybe you should just tell her your faith in a higher power is a work in progress.\n\nBest of luck...",

All you evangelical American nuts have the same thinking capacity you demonstrated with confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance.

You\u2019re a cancer and lack of critical thinking will lead america to the failed state that has started already. Only countries that have freed themselves from the church like in Europe will have the capacity to progress, while you idiots vote for egomaniacs that pander to your churches and prehistoric beliefs that promote hatred.",

That being said, I did not, in fact, break off that friendship, and we are going strong. If the two of you really do care for / love eachother, and wanna continue the relationship despite some obvious struggles that may present themselves later on, I do think you could talk your way out of it.\n\nAssure her that you're there for the time that counts (that being now), and while you may not exactly fit the mold of her religion, you're still trying your best to be a good person. Try to work around her beliefs at future points, let the two of you come to compromises, and leave anything that wouldn't really be allowed in the aforementioned religion for other friends or alone time(but do make sure she knows you're doing those things, because it can sting to find out abruptly on her end).",
