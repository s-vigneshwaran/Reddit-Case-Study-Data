And when it's coming from conservative politicians, pundits, and show hosts, this is absolutely on purpose.

There\u2019s literally no downsides.\n\nYou legalize prostitution, sex workers can work in a legal establishment where they\u2019ll be protected from creeps by the owner and security, reducing the risk of a worker being hurt. Birth control and condoms will always be on hand, reducing the risk of STD\u2019s spreading or unwanted pregnancies from occurring. A dedicated establishment will increase the comfort of both the worker and the client. You make it legal and now sex work is taxable income, increasing tax revenue for the government. \n\nThe only reason prostitution is so risky is *because* it\u2019s illegal. The proper amenities aren\u2019t provided and as a result it causes STD\u2019s to run rampant and puts the workers in serious danger everytime they pick up a client. Legalizing it would eliminate all risk and like uncle Sam\u2019s pockets.\n\nBUT, the American way is practically built on sexual repression. While other countries view pedophilia or incest as taboo, many Americans and have the government view pretty much anything other than a monogamous relationship as taboo.",

He never did manage to give up. \n\nI've never had a psychological addiction (my physical dependency on the opioid pain medication I'm medically prescribed, given my condition, doesn't qualify), but that doesn't mean I can't sympathise with those who do.

It's like dropping a distracting trivia fact and then (often) being angry that it gets disregarded in favor of the actual conversation. \n\n\nWhile we're here, though-- More than just the distinction of pubescent vs prepubescent, there is unfortunately value in distinguishing the genuine difference between child sexual abusers and pedophiles-- I say \"unfortunately\" because it would probably have the same reception if thrown into a pre-existing conversation as hebephelia/ephebophilia does. \n\nPedophilia is a psychological term rather than a legal one. A pedophile is predominantly or exclusively attracted to prepubescent children. That could mean taking abusive actions, or taking none. On the flip side, the majority of child sexual abusers don't fall into this category. Children are easy targets for people that turn to abuse for a sense of power, for a place to direct their anger and stress, etc. Opportunistic predators. The lack of distinction between these terms, though, can create hurdles for people actually getting help.",

What I said at the first half of my comment wasn't necessarily condemnation. \n\nThere's times that bringing up things like hebephilia is clearly motivated not by wanting accurate terminology, but to undermine the severity of the abuser's actions or shift the conversation away from the actual topic. The way it's chimed in sometimes adds about as much to a conversation as \"uh, it's *'their'* not *'there.'*\"\n\nUsing accurate terminology in one's own statements and incorporating definitions into the conversation as they become genuinely relevant (without detracting from the actual topic) is probably the best way to go about it.\n\n(I also have a sinking suspicion I'm forgetting something but I have to go somewhere so.. hope this makes as much sense as I think)",

But since I did that I do now that causing nuclear explosions is only [a crime](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p2791) if you \"endanger\" people or valuable property of someone else and that [14 is indeed the](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p1633) age of consent in Germany. \nFor what it's worth, I guess it's how you have to deal with these things if you're trying to both a free society not be hypocritical. The last time I read about it in the new was because the expert commission charged with overlooking the law determined that it should remain in place. Our system simply tries to have a step-by-step into adulthood and that starts with 14 and ends at 18 (21 for immature criminals)\nSo at 14 you're simply allowed to make a lot of decisions for yourself. Including medical procedures (a little more complicated) and who you sleep with, regardless of their age, but there's still protections and conditions. Those then get lessened at 16 and disappear at 18. \n\nBefore that you're actually a child. That does for example mean that you can't be prosecuted. I.e. just as Americans may find our age of consent disturbing, people here may consider it akin to human trafficking when 12-year-olds are arrested.",

Otherwise the age of consent is 16, although provisions protecting minors against abuse apply until the age of 18 (under Section 182(1): it is illegal to engage in sexual activity with a person under 18 \"by taking advantage of an exploitative situation\").\"\n\nSo basically, as long as the minor doesn't complain anyone over 18 can fuck them. Which makes no sense, the entire point of age of consent laws is that a literal developing child cannot be expected to properly consent to any sexual act with a person over 18. Most of these cases are grooming, where the minor believes themselves to be on equal footing with the adult, and typically don't recognize the abuse they suffered until after the fact. That's why there's an alarmingly miniscule number of reports for an 18+ year old taking advtbage if a 14-16 year olds \"lack of capacity for sexual self-determination\", the victims aren't reporting it and even if they do its so vague that proving they did it takes time and resources that the state would rather not spend. So it's easier for the laws to just accept it and let the victims be totally unprotected once they come to terms with the abuse they suffered. \n\nYou see it all the time on this site, Europeans with disgusting consent laws either excusing or outright denying they have these laws. The US gets shit on for every.single.thing it does wrong, yet a 14 and 21 year old being legally allowed to fuck in Germany is just okay with everyone.",

Before reverting to her usual expression and speech pattern.\n\nThis is not natural behaviour for her, and I believe that she was coached to do it in order to increase the impact of the  address. Just as she's been coached all her life into this political position. As I wrote earlier, I don't blame her in the slightest for what she is or what she's done.\n\nI didn't argue that she was too young to think for herself, I stated what she wasn't permitted to do, by her country, at her age. So, not my position but that of the Swedish government. And many others around the world.\n\nEveryone's opinion deserves respect in proportion to the degree to which they can defend it. The go-to argument for countering people who question the utility and/or efficacy of responses  to climate change is \"you're not a climate scientist.\" Well, neither is she. At the time, she'd not yet completed the Swedish equivalent of High School. Yet she displayed a certainty about what was happening, what was about to happen, and what should be done about it that the IPCC wouldn't have dared.\n\nNothing wrong with being *concerned* about the future state of the world. Expressing fear in an attempt to spread fear is frowned upon in many other spheres (the politics of immigration is the best example, but there are plenty more) because it is regarded as manipulative (and has a troublesome history).\n\nI don't think anyone in power felt threatened by Greta('s parents).

These types of situations are hardly black and white, there are various things to consider that can alter the situation.\n\nBy the standards of some of the Americans I've met, the aforementioned 18 year old should be in jail, yet for all we know, the 18 year old might've skipped 2 years in school, and goes to the same school and class as the 15 year old. Then it could be discussed whether it's wrong for somebody to date their classmate.\n\nWith such things considered, the ones who have the laws making the sexual relationship between a 17 year old and a 18 year old \"illegal\" are the real savages.\nPlease bear that in mind before you call somebody's country savage.\n\n\nNote: I do realize that you grew up with different values, so it's understandable that you find a difference in fundamental laws like this hard to relate to. Please remember that we grew up with these laws as the norm, just as you grew up with yours.\nYet neither of us live in a country so chaotic it's about to collapse.\n\nSorry for the essay, people who call Scandinavian country laws chaotic when they clearly haven't seen what it's actually like have become a pet-peeve of mine.",

If anything, i think it comes from the few things we hear whenever Americans talk about Denmark on social media, where they're often misinformed, saying things like \"Denmark is a socialist country\", which is honestly laughable.\nI think it spawns a form of resentment in us, that the US truthfully doesn't deserve. Some of the things we hear come from places like Fox News, and the average dane obviously doesn't know the reputation they have, so instead of taking it with a grain of salt, we take it personally and create something like [this](https://youtu.be/JXecLXlzEXE).\n\nI agree that a 32 year old following a 16 year old with perhaps less than pure intentions is definitely off-putting, and the Danish age of consent is no excuse to that, and honestly only works as a \"well, technically\", but that doesn't change the difference in age.\n\nAnyway, I personally feel a little more enlightened about the US laws after this, so thanks for that :)\nAnd sorry for my bad habit of writing A LOT",

Since the parents usually knows their child best, they are the ones who decide whether or not they actually gave consent, or if the situation is different in cases such as grooming.\n\nTechnically speaking, this could mean that, if the parents allowed it (only god knows why they would do that), the sexual relationship could be allowed to exist.\nI say that with plenty of discomfort, but luckily, this has only ever happened once to my knowledge, and that man immediately lost his job and ended up leaving the country due to harassment (dude's name is \"J\u00f8rgen Leth\")",

Somehow that has been twisted to everything under 18 in every state is illegal.\n\nMy own opinion though is that age of consent should be 18 and then there be Romeo and Juliet clauses in all states.",

Any form of power dynamic is also a no go in Denmark, so from what you're saying there isn't really much difference between us other than it's 15 instead of 16.\nNo porn before 18 is also what I stated in my first comment that started this whole conversation.\n\nThis was very informative though, so thanks for sharing :)\nAs for your opinion, I agree, at least for the US states. It's not my place to say what laws should be changed in a place I've never even been to, but I'm sure that changing the age of consent to 18 would at least clear up a lot of the confusion there is about it.\n\nAs for Denmark, I believe it should remain as is. There's no real confusion about the law, except for your average village idiot. And except for the case of J\u00f8rgen Leth, which actually raised awareness about it, there haven't been any issues with it. The only purpose changing the law would serve, would be pleasing the opinions of people who don't live in the country.",

I do not have the link, and I don't care to dig for it right now but people link it fairly often here on Reddit which is where I first saw it. Anyway it boils down to two things, people of lower intelligence and certain ways of thinking are wholly incapable of grasping hypotheticals and have a lack of empathy for the people that live differently than them *because* those people's lives are hypotheticals. This isn't to say they are stupid, they often have higher mechanical intelligence and are better than average at one specific thing in their lives such as a trade skill or hobby as opposed to those with a higher total intelligence having broader skill sets and require more intensive training for specialization. They also are far more susceptible to magical thinking which is related to things like acceptance of religion, and sadly being more likely to fall into cults and for too-good-to-be-true scams/grifts like MLMs and Qanon.\n\nIt's just the way they are wired, and very probably an evolutionary artifact adapted to fitting into and protecting smaller groups aka tribalism. This also means we almost certainly wouldn't have survived this long as a species without them but in today's world they are very reluctant to change with a world that's changing at an ever increasing rate.",

Even though it doesn't really work since: the children in Epstein's cased were cooerced and trafficked into the situation, and Greta isn't actually making policy decisions just being a figurehead of a movement.",

She\u2019s virtue signaling at its finest. She makes lazy people feel okay about being lazy just because they agree with her.\n\nYou tell me how and the fuck she is a good person to speak on this topic? She\u2019s from Sweden, she\u2019s media savvy and really what she represents is the westerners idea of a child impacted by climate change. Where\u2019s the starving child from africa? Where\u2019s the children of citrus farmers around the world currently dealing with the citrus blight?\n\nThe fuck reason why should I listen to an upper middle class teenager from Sweden who has yet to do anything to advance humanity.",

In this case, he's saying her point of view is wrong or irrelevant because she's not old enough to have a point of view instead of trying to refute the point of view itself. Remember, anyone can have an accurate and important point of view regardless of who they are. Repudiations of a point of view that hinge on the person making it should be disregarded. Jeffrey Dahmer could make a good point about human rights abuses somewhere, and who he is doesn't affect the point of view at all. Bernie Madoff could suggest that politicians are stealing money, and who he is doesn't make it less or more accurate.",

Probably also to limit the tax burden of unwanted pregnancies.\n\nI think basic sex education and the personal cost / benefit analysis of \"do I want to do this?\" Require a lot less maturity than global policy.\n\nOf course this gets sketchy when you realize everyone is different and Greta could just be an outlier as far as maturity goes.

I said quite a way back that the humanity or lack thereof of a fetus is a moot point when conservatives are happy to use the unborn to run roughshod over the unambiguously alive and human, showing they don't really value humanity except as an excuse to run roughshod over the rights of others.\n\nI personally don't give a shit how human fetuses are, because the mother is always more human. And it disgusts me to see conservatives getting so uppity about it when they're otherwise happy to ignore or even exacerbate the suffering of the living. It's a sick kind of hypocrisy that I think Dave Barnhart did a good job of describing:\n\n\u201cThe unborn\u201d are a convenient group of people to advocate for. They never make demands of you; they are morally uncomplicated, unlike the incarcerated, addicted, or the chronically poor; they don\u2019t resent your condescension or complain that you are not politically correct; unlike widows, they don\u2019t ask you to question patriarchy; unlike orphans, they don\u2019t need money, education, or childcare; unlike aliens, they don\u2019t bring all that racial, cultural, and religious baggage that you dislike; they allow you to feel good about yourself without any work at creating or maintaining relationships; and when they are born, you can forget about them, because they cease to be unborn. You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone. They are, in short, the perfect people to love if you want to claim you love Jesus, but actually dislike people who breathe. Prisoners? Immigrants? The sick? The poor? Widows? Orphans? All the groups that are specifically mentioned in the Bible? They all get thrown under the bus for the unborn.\u201d",

Where everybody is an island who exists in isolation and nobody else is obliged to go out of their way for them even in the extremes of need (a Christian nation where there's no love, care, or concern for thy neighbour. Ironic right?) How do you build anything resembling a community on such weak foundations?\n\nYou don't care how the children you force to be born suffer as long as it happens out of your sight and mind - you just don't give a shit about the consequences for others of the sanctimonious theocratic edicts you hand down. You don't care who has to die in need of healthcare as long as you're not troubled by the idea that you're paying for things for other people (even if it makes healthcare dramatically cheaper for you too at the same time). It's just sad.\n\nYou've degenerated into a nation (and I use the term loosely, it's more like a massive PvP map) of bucket crabs. It's honestly sad to watch from the outside how barbarically you treat eachother, and how your ideas of freedom have warped into \"I can be the least conscientious and considerate and most asshole version of myself and nobody can do shit about it lol\". Hyperindividualism is a disease.\n\nThis isn't even just about you, but Americans I encounter on the internet in general and how sad some of the stuff you guys come out with makes me - precisely because I can tell you absolutely believe it. Among Americans, complete self-centredness seems so common, and they're tragically cynical about collective effort, or even just the idea of someone doing good things for no other reason than because it's the right thing to do. From some of the things internet Americans come out with, I get the sense I'd find more community spirit in a maximum security prison.",

That's why conservatives with power is dangerous: anyone they can't relate to doesn't count as fully human to them, and they treat them accordingly.

Women like that have died horribly because of abortion laws before.\n\nDefinitely seems like one of those situations where the cruelty is the main point. Like so many conservative solutions looking for problems, it ruins so many other lives besides even those of the \"guilty\" that it's just not worth it, but conservatives still won't hear it.\n\nIn the end, even if you only want to put certain limitations on abortion, you're on a slippery slope with a conservative Supreme Court that's already lied about its intentions to overturn Roe v Wade.
