The last time (5 years ago now) when I got a prescription change, while they where making adjustments to my glasses I was able to take a picture of the sheet with the PD on it.  Now I just use the new script and those two PD numbers and order online.  Just ordered a pair of sunglasses (progressive) from Zenni and they cost $187.00 Canadian.  I ordered my regular glasses from [clearly.ca](https://clearly.ca) and they have gone up a bit in price now.  The ones at the optometrist where going to be over 700 and that was just for lenses.  I told them even with insurance (that only covers 250) that I would have to wait until I could afford them.",

They repackage things and slap a new label on it. And yes awful things can and do happen from improper contact lens wear and care on occasion. \n\n2) yes you are correct in the sense optometrists and ophthalmologists are/were trying to protect their bottom line\n\nBut please just understand that those companies are completely predatory and despite a lower cost are not some  godsend savior with your best interest in mind.",

To be fair im legally blind without them so there are plenty of times i was just trying to put them on and threw them off a table. I keep putting them off because i honestly hate wearing glasses because my lenses are so heavy theyre always slipping and buying lighter thinner lenses is way too expensive for my prescription.

It used to be they looked a bit crap but these days they\u2019re fine.\n\n2) At you specifically, you\u2019re telling me, **with** \u201cinsurance\u201d you\u2019re out $650? Here that\u2019s Gucci, Prada etc money. 100-200 notes here get you designer/brand frames with basically any lenses you require and a cheap spare or nicer ones with seeming permanent 2 for 1 deals. The chain stores will do you some nice looking frames and lenses and a second pair or some prescription sunnies (not that we need them very often) for much less than that even. \n\n3) I read someone saying they don\u2019t get a copy of their pescription. What the fuck is that about? You take an eye test here, you get a copy. The test itself is cheap but the chains often offer them free as a loss leader and give you a copy of the results for you to shop around. We usually buy with them though, you know, because. With that copy of your prescription you can buy glasses online for absurdly low prices because of the lowered overhead. \n\nI\u2019m shocked you guys stand for it, I really am. You know all those guns you guys have in case those in power starts fucking you over? Now may be the time... /s",

                              "text": "I'm an eye doctor. Zenni Optical is great if you don't have insurance and can't afford better lenses. Like any other product, there are better and worse versions of the product. Buying lenses is like buying a car: you can get a Ford Focus or you can get a Porsche. Zenni is selling you a Focus and not charging you much for it, which is great. It's also true Luxottica is a behemoth in the industry. I hate them but you can't *not* do business with them because they own a huge swath of the designer frame industry too. (Seriously, fuck Luxottica). I don't really care much about frames. What I do care about is optics. Optics are interesting, and complex, and necessary for sharp vision. A Zenni lens is sourced from China and literally costs them less than a dollar. It will be a single vision (i.e., most basic optics. A bifocal or progressive or literally anything else will cost you more and be much more of a gamble to purchase online due to tighter fitting parameters). It won't  be aspheric or digital lens (more advanced optics) and it will be made of polycarbonate (a serviceable but optically inferior ophthalmic plastic). In essence, you're getting a lens that will make you see better than you do without *any* glasses but that isn't necessarily *optimum* vision...but it will certainly be better, even pretty sharp, if you're lucky. OK, back to my car analogy. So Zenni's selling you a Ford Focus or some other entry level car. Again that's ok, but would you compare the performance of a Focus to that of a Porsche? Only someone who was delusional or had never experienced a Porsche would do that. What you're generally getting at an eye doctor is the optical equivalent of a Porsche. A Focus and a Porsche both perform the basics of transportation: they get you from Point A to Point B - but few would same they are the same or the experience is the same. This analogy holds for lenses as well: they both let you *see* but the visual experience is not the same. However, it's difficult to describe unless you've experienced both. If I had to put it in words I would say that in a better lens design and material your acuity would be sharper, there will be less distortion, better color rendering, better peripheral acuity, quicker adaptation, less motion induced distortion, less glare, and longer lens lifespan- to highlight a few advantages. The downside is of course you pay for all this stuff. There are lenses that cost the doc hundreds of dollar a pair and Luxottica isn't making things easier. To sum up, Zenni's selling the basics and, much like Walmart is cheaper than Nordstrom, good lenses cost more because 1) quality costs more and 2) capitalism. Hope this perspective helps.",

Find the size of the eye/bridge/temple size, usually found on the inside of the temple. They may not be in that order, but you can tell which is which because the temple is almost always the highest and the bridge the lowest. Anyway, try to find glasses that match those specs. Also, if the numbers are rubbed off, just measure one eye of the frame from the top left to the bottom right in cm for the size. Then the bridge is the shortest distance between the left and right eye. The temple is from where the hinge begins.",

Mine were -7 -7 in each eye with +2 for my progressives. My ophthalmologist did it and showed -6.25 right, -6.50 left and +2.25 for progressives. I can see much better out of these.

I was lucky that technology caught up with my problem at point in my life where I was able to take advantage of it. Before the operation they gave me an eye exam and found out I had less than 1% eyesight, the funny thing is I never imagined my eyes being that bad. I used to think that losing your eyesight meant you can\u2019t even se light, or that you had blind spot where you would only see black And since a I was able to see blurry shapes and color I just didn\u2019t realize it was that bad. \n\nI really hope things go better for your eyesight, having bad eyesight really sucks.",

He was an old guy whatever the male Karen is, refused my help up with a pained \"fuck you don't touch me\" I told him to get the fuck off my property then. I learned the meaning of \"tail between his legs\" that day. Gist of his he didn't like how closely I walked to his truck, parked at the curb IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE and I was walking on the sidewalk and I wasn't taking shit that day shot back with some lip, he threw a punch. It felt super badass, just one fluid sequence of events, let the momentum of the hit take me to my glasses put them back on as I regained my balance.",

If you are a woman, and you escalate to   \n            physical violence, you lose your privilege.\n       1.2. If you hit a woman unprovoked, \n            you become fair game. \n    \n    \n    2. Second rule of fight privilege: Don't hit someone \n       wearing glasses!\n    \n       2.1. If you wear glasses and you escalate to   \n            physical violence, you lose that privilege\n       2.2. If you hit a person with glasses unprovoked, \n            you become fair game.\n       2.3. Any party wishing to initiating the fight must \n            take what ever steps are necessary to insure the \n            glasses are safely secured before any physical \n            altercations can commence.\n    \n    \n    3. Third rule of fight privilege: The right to \n       self preservation!\n    \n       3.1. You are not required to aid any person that\n            has broken any of the above rules. If you\n            do, you become fair game.\n\nThis woman not only voided her own fight privilege (article 1.1 - persona extra ius privilegii), but also violated someone else's fight privilege (article 2.2 - persona extra legem).\n\nBased on fight privilege law, boyfriend/husband should not have intervened by trying to enter the fight (article 3.1- persona extra legem), but instead should have removed his worse half from the fight and given her one single warning, or if this was not her first violation of fight privilege law, broken up with her on the spot and walked away.  \n\n\nAnd I'm not even going to get into established common sense law that states to never pick a fight with someone that can clearly kick your ass.",

Thought her dude was tougher than he was or perhaps she wouldn't get hit back bc She's a white chick and he's a black dude? Who knows. \n\nWild you think I'm defending her. \n\nMost people get slaps on the wrist for slapping people. I'm sorry, but that's literally the reality of the situation. Women do tend to get lesser sentences for the same crime, but for assault like what she did typically there won't be a prison sentence or jail time. At most informal probation from what I've seen from both men and women. \n\nIf you could link me a situation where a (white especially) male aggressor slaps someone in the face (that isn't DV since DV laws mandate arrest always in cases of domestic violence) and goes to jail, that would be cool. Since that would be the equivalent. \n\nI could see *him* getting jailtime for it since he's a black man and black men get far worse sentences than white men for the same crime, especially if he attacked a white woman. But that's a different problem than gender discrimination. \n\nIt would have been better if they mandated anger management or therapy or something and had her on informal probation to keep an eye on her but I'm guessing she has no formal record and of course she's a woman. Reddit always acts like people should have gotten 10 years or something for things that never get people that much time. It's like severe ignorance of the law.",

If you care about your loved ones who might be forced to defend you, you wouldn't start a fight that will endanger them. Don't give bullshit excuses about how it can be justified. Don't manipulate them by saying if they love you, they will defend you for the bullshit you started or invited.

UNLESS you are defending  yourself. If a woman attacks you and you are unable to remove yourself from that situation then you are absolutely within your rights to defend yourself. But try to make sure their are witnesses or film if you can. \n\nI always think of a news story where a guy was on the subway minding his own business when a group of girls started harassing him. He just ignored them until one started hitting him with a six inch heel of her shoe and he had enough and slapped the soul out of her. Someone called the police and those girls said he attacked them for no reason and the police believed them, arrested the guy. I think he even spent a couple of nights in jail until someone came to the police with footage showing the girls attacking him and him defending himself. And people still said he shouldn\u2019t have hit them. \n\nIt stresses me out because there are women out there who are abusive towards men and know how to work the system. I worry about them running into people like in this video",

Or is it that you have to wait to see if your chosen idiot wins the fight first, because then they must have been in the right? Sounds to me like in addition to cowardice and lack of class we could also add unbelievably slow processing skills and situationally fluid ethics.

I'm of the opinion that most women should never hit a man first unless their life is in danger, because regardless of how society wants to paint a rosy picture of equality, more often than not the weakest 20% of men can absolutely destroy 90% of women, I don't understand why they would ever take the risk.

I told her I would when she was in the right, but she wasn't. We fought for hours over it.\n\nThe next time she did it the compulsion to help her was stronger. I didn't, though, and I left her when she came at me again.\n\nI still reflect on that weird desire to defend her for something she started. She had other habits of abuse, though. That manipulation was just part of the whole. I mean, she started fights with random people - that's abuse in itself. Of course she was abusive all around.\n\nEdit: The dude who got laid out in this video might be a victim of emotional abuse. Not saying he absolutely is, just saying he could.",

I\u2019m in my 30s, my Mom was diagnosed and medicated, and my parents are still together and frankly lovely to be around. \n\nAll that being said, I definitely felt a familiarity seeing this dynamic.

Even if your ex is the one who was starting the fight, it's a good trait to have to want to reduce harm and protect the ones close to you.\n\nHer starting fights and wanting you to fight on her behalf is the issue. You're 100% right about the manipulation going on. But the compulsion itself isn't necessarily a bad thing. Just depends on how you go about it.",

Boxed and played hockey. Even back then I was like 6'3, 220.\n\nA few weeks after my 16th birthday, I got in a dumb argument with my mom about something, and he started ordering me to shut up. Him not being my father, and me being 16 and fueled on adrenaline and testosterone, I told him straight up, \"This ain't your house and I ain't your son, so get the fuck out of my face\". Was I out of line? Sure, probably. But I was also correct, he didn'traiseme and had no power over me. Anyway, he decided to grab me, I think he thought he could scare me. He put his hand on my throat, and I flipped. I gave him a right hook to the kidney and uppercut to the jaw, and he dropped like a sack of potatoes. I left. Came back a few hours later. He was gone, I never saw him again. \n\nTo this day, over 25 years later, my mom has never mentioned it. \n\nAll for the best though, she met a great man who I have a ton of respect for. \n\nIf that shit happened in 2022, I'd probably be in juvie, because wow, I fucked him up.",

We are living through a historic resurgence of white supremacy, not 60 full years after the civil rights act even gave historically disenfranchised black Americans the vote. We have never reckoned with or atoned for the historical sin of chattel slavery and indigenous genocide, and those legacies are tearing the country apart - and to be clear, it is WHITE America's job to atone for those legacies.\n\nAnd it's hard for me to blame him. I really can't, because I can't promise you I wouldn't start throwing punches if someone slapped me.\n\nBut none of that makes it okay. You are absolutely right about the damage that punch did. He was knocked unconscious. Recovery is going to be long and painful and he may have long term consequences as well.\n\nPeople need to remember that two wrongs don't make a right. You don't have to pick sides - BOTH people can be wrong. It was absolutely wrong for her to slap him and she shares the lion's share of the blame for instigating the violence. but two wrongs don't make a right. it's a cliche but it's the goddamn truth and I hate that people don't actually believe that anymore.\n\nnot to mention, given the white supremacist police state that we live in, he was being fucking stupid by escalating at all. just bad judgement all around.\n\nAnd folks, it was not \"self-defense.\" \"Self-defense\" does not result in someone knocked unconscious on the ground. Self defense is: A) trying to leave the situation; B) if you cannot leave the situation, restrain the aggressor.\n\nI know we live in this hypermacho fucking culture and we've all been desensitized to violence and you're all going to disagree with me. There's still right and wrong and unpopularity doesn't automatically entail being wrong. It's American culture that is fucked.\n\nEDITED to reflect my real opinion better.",

In the US, the definition of assault varies by jurisdiction, but is generally defined as *intentionally putting another person in reasonable apprehension of an imminent harmful or offensive contact*. Battery is generally defined as\u00a0*a physical act that results in harmful or offensive contact with another person without that person's consent.* A person can commit battery without committing assault. For example: a sucker punch. No threat, no apprehension of harm, just unexpected offensive contact. In most jurisdictions, that would be considered battery. Therefore, no, battery is generally not \"assault causing injury.\" Not unless you threaten someone so loudly that it damages their hearing.",

They're the first to say:\n\n*\"Well, sure... it kind of sort of seems a little excessive, but look here... this lady has an unpaid parking ticket from 1997, she's obviously part of a criminal network, and honestly, I feel like the officer went above and beyond by kicking her door in so he could give her a chance to surrender... I would have shot her house from the street, with a Howitzer... this woman is clearly a menace to society and we need to support this officer for his efforts to finally bring her in to face justice.  I know I'll sleep better tonight knowing she's finally off the streets and her reign of terror has finally come to an end.\"*",

It happened when I was a kid, and the news channels showed videos and stills of the incident for weeks. There were dead and dying people lying on the pitch in all of the images, and I found them both deeply traumatic and inescapable, as they were constantly dominating the news. At that point, I had never attended a professional game of any sort, but I understood that people who normally would not hurt other people had thoughtlessly taken the lives of others, including kids, just to see a game. That left me quite shaken, and I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve ever fully recovered from the realization. Hence, I find large crowds at games unnerving, and prefer to watch from a safer, quieter space. Because games are my trigger, I refer to my condition as \u201csituational\u201d ochlophobia (fear that a crowd will become a mob, and hurt me).",

There's a lot of gals out there that know how to send someone to take a nap, not giving a shit about genders. \n\nWhat happens is that the gender equality part where you should not underestimate a person by its gender (because both of you have the same rights and follow the same laws), seems to leave the chat when a woman hits a man. I hate how physical violence is brushed away just because \"a man is stronger\". Violence is violence. I would love to see people talking and de-escalating this kind of situations, even if it takes some yelling. \n\nThis woman does not represent what feminism and women's rights are about, she's a bigot. Is a shame for all the women fighting for the real issue.\n\nIf you have the balls to behave like her, keep your balls when you receive a punch back.",

There's some left and right stuff, you know, people that goes below or above what it matters and get lost in terminology and that won't help what millions of men and women have as a reality. Situations that we would only think as a nightmare but for them are their every day. Worst thing? Kids get this confusion and don't understand what they care about because a lot of spineless people don't take the time to educate them. \n\nTo support women's rights:\n\n- There's no need to disrespect other's rights (males, animals, any creature regardless how they identity themselves). \n\n- The fact that once we were oppressed and it keeps happening in some places doesn't justify that I can oppress others. Instead by being aware of how oppression can impact us, I should share the knowledge. \n- I have to act, because flapping my lips ain't enough. The change comes from my head to my daily acts, thoughts and behaviors. I can empower anyone in need, help with resources and take care of the ones oppressed. Do something to support the organizations or people that can change the status quo. \n\n- Preach equality but be equal. Why my genitals or how I identify myself in this world or my skin tone makes me different from another human? I have blood, bones and flesh inside, like anyone (well maybe more fat, I'm working on that detail tho). I'll die and rott like the richest person in this Earth or the most evil person. \n\n- I need also to learn and be sure I can understand and explain in simple terms what I believe in and why is important, at least for me. Why I consider this is a good cause, not sending people to google shit and when someone comes back to discuss the topic, be able to exchange ideas without shoveling them in your head. \n\nIs a matter of seeing ourselves beyond race, gender, age... I think we should start to support \"humanism\".\nThanks for your comment! \uff61\u25d5\u203f\u25d5\uff61",

It wasn't violent though.\n\nI didn't think he was white knighting but in the moment a dude was hitting at his Karen (even tho she started it).\n\nAlso for gender equality it is complicated because the average woman attacking the average male is a joke - Jordan Peterson said his wife would have to come behind him with something sharp.

America doubled down on an idea that was on its way out elsewhere in the world at the time, and that's left us very behind the rest of the west in terms of social equity.",

He punched him probably a little more than he should have. I think white guy and dude that got slapped cancel out. Idk if that\u2019s how the law work but that\u2019s how it does in my mind. What she did wasn\u2019t that bad. I\u2019d someone slapped me and their friend got their ass best and the person that slapped me got a disorderly conducts charge I\u2019d be ok with it. Could be better could be worse but not unreasonable.",

He defended. When the threat was neutralized he stopped. I'm not disagreeing that violence is bad but the couple is clearly more in the wrong here. The dude sat there and allowed her to act out. Not wanting to be involved is the wrong answer. If you're sayin glasses dude should've gone to security, knocked out dude shoulda been more practive in stopping his companion and girl shoulda kept her hands to herself. Can't hold the guy that defended himself fully accountable \"after\" the fact he had to \"defend\" himself.",

It's not reasonable to ask someone to back up, through a crowd of people and chairs, while being threatened by someone else, after they've been drinking. \n\nAs for her having multiple attackers, that's true. Here's the difference, though. They would most likely be in front of her since that's where he was, AND you're not saying she should retreat. You can tell by his posture he was already on the defensive. Look at the video. He's already leaning far back. Yes, they're both within punching distance, but the way they're positioned implies that she's in his personal space, not the other way around. Even if he wanted to move away, he would have had to move her hand away to get down the isle. \n\nAs for the legality of the situation, she has already been charged with disorderly conduct while he's not facing any charges.\n\nhttps://foxsportsradio.iheart.com/content/2021-09-20-woman-who-instigated-viral-steelers-game-fight-now-facing-criminal-citation/",

Then he defends himself and white knights like you claim it isn't self defense and even ignore video evidence \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 grow up, people are allowed to defend himself even if they just feel threatened. Spitting is enough to justify self defense. But go on victim blaming the guy who was completely calm while she berated him and told him to get the fuck out, until the moment she touched him. You can literally see his whole expression and demeanor change right as he says don't touch him and creates distance, she pushed her luck and slapped him. Fucked around and found out. Go victim blame somewhere else, I'm done talking to you",

I am happy we agree the dude who swung is definitely in the wrong entirely lol if he hadn't and had grabbed his girl it would've just ended a slap box\n\nDefending the one doing the assulting is never right. The people who broke up the fight and the ones asking for the glasses were definitely in the right though but I don't think you're including them really, but just in case. I personally can't blame him for freaking out when it became a 2v1, and I'd personally never hit a woman unless she like pulled a gun or something but I can't blame another man for defending himself",

If your goal is to optimize your outcome, you will not punch people in general unless you HAVE TO, and some drunk lady slapping you doesn't count. You call stadium security and get that lady and her boyfriend kicked out. You win, they lose. \n\nThe general issue here is the fact that _IN GENERAL_ men are bigger and stronger than women. In this kind of drunked slap fight situation, you're not afraid for your health. Be realistic. You're wanting to punch because your _pride_ is hurt, otherwise you'd do what I said above ... rat her ass out and enjoy the rest of the game in peace. \n\nYou can justifiably beat on someone weaker than you if they actually threaten your health or the health of others. If she pulls a knife, ok, knock her teeth out (if you can't run away), but otherwise ... at least be honest with yourself ... you're looking for a green light to crush inferior competition.",

The difference between touching and slapping is a big deal. One was to move someone back the other is to strike someone and hurt them. slapping and punching both serve the same purpose, to hit and hurt somebody, so technically she was the first to hit with attempt to harm and therefore the first to commit assault. And again we didnt see any escalation beforehand she might\u2019ve , and probably did do, Whats the point you keep talking about? You think she was in the right to hit him but not him to hit her afterwards? We have video proof that she committed assault first, the man likely acted in self defense, then we have you accusing him of assualt for defending himself .\n\nAnd by the way no ive thought about what you said \u201cput your hand on a woman and get slapped\u201d i think thats bullshit. Its narrow minded. When women are getting in your personal space and abusing you they deserve to be treated just how men are treated. Just how i would be treated, because thats what equality is. This woman was treated even better than i as a man would\u2019ve been in this situation. Touching a woman doesnt always mean you deserve to be attacked, thats absolutely sexist and one sided. If a woman was threatening me and in my personal space or groping me im allowed to push her or move her away from me, shes not automatically allowed to hit me back because shes a woman. Thats wrong to think.\n\nTo use self defense you must be in danger, the woman was never harmed and would not have been in any danger if she hadnt have hit the man. The man was attacked physically and harmed before acting.. he simply nudged her and she hit him super hard in the face out of anger. He then hit her back in retaliation. Its obvious and its right infront of your eyes on video, you still don\u2019t comprehend it after many people explaining it",

The husband didn't get involved until after he gestured that he was going to hit the wife.\n\nHe could have easily walked away from the even the harder slap.  In states without stand your ground law, that is presented as the legally \"right\" action.  That being said, Pennsylvania has stand-your-ground laws (which again goes back to my statement of \"depends on the jurisdiction\").\n\nNone of which changes the fact that by time the man was trying to attack the concussed husband, it was definitively out of the realm of self-defense.  The man was out cold, no longer attacking nor defending.",

Atacks a man that has y caracteristics, in z situation\n\nPer example, lets supose (dont seem like it) that the woman has a black belt, and ofends with killing intent...in that situation, the man doesnt defend himself? Try to be the better person? The man doesnt know that woman, the man only sees that he s hurt, and even in that situation, this guy acts really well, controls his punches to 1 on 1 , and then when a 2 on 1 starts, he stops being nice\n\nIf thats not self defense then nothing is\n\nI understand the fact that in most situation the woman has less chances in this type of discussion, not for being less but for being build diferent, but that doesnt made an agression less bad, and an stupid agresion, like per example, spit on someone or push someone can be lethal in some situations, just for bad luck, that makes any agresion, being from a woman , or a man, a thing that  should not be accepted , and self defense is a right, even if the person that hits you is a minor or a woman\n\nAnd yeah, a minor can also kill a person\n\nSaying that, overdefense is also not a good thing\nIf you dont understand this point...there is a great exageration with uncle jim in south park\n\nIts coming right to us!!! Then proceeds to kill it with guns\n\n\n\nIn the end , in the second you re being offended, defend yourself\n\nThe first one to hit loses his rights to not being hit, but doesnt give the defending side a chance to lethal force, ideally just enought to defend, but thats hard to calculate\n\nAnd when it all ends, the jury would be the one eeciding the factors, LOOKING AT THE SPECIFIC SITUATION, NOT A GENERAL , because, well, justice needs to be especific and flexible to be a good justice",

Having your hand near someone's face isn't touching someone, you're right. (She may have actually touched him, it's not clear in this video because of the angle)  but if I was hostile and kept going from a pointing finger to gesturing like I'm going to swing, you'd be well within your rights to assume it's a threat and act accordingly. Where I live currently, a threat in that manner constitutes an assault, and you can defend yourself.   \n\n\nCowardly would be hitting someone then expecting everyone around to come save you. Cowardly is what she did. When she slapped him, he didn't just go straight to cold-cocking her. He checked her, and her boyfriend/dad/sugar daddy stood up, took a swing. He only hit her when she was in front, trying to swing. Once she stopped swinging, you'll notice he uses his off-hand to keep her out of the way. The dude used a lot less force than most people would.   \n\n\nTL;DR: Just because you're a woman doesn't mean you can assault someone repeatedly without consequence.",

If someone who atfacks you gets away with it, they will most likely do it again.\n\nAlso remember, the dude is black in america. There is already a sense of danger and uneasement when it comes to violence towards himself. Also, he rarely attacked the woman. He just mainly pushed her away at first, which is totally respectable!

We had ahold of both groups keeping them apart when in walks the police that was sitting in the parking lot.\n\nThey take one look and even though we tell them that the white guys started it, they start cuffing the black dudes and a couple of other black people when they started complaining about that being wrong.\n\nNext thing we know people just snapped over the outrage, and we had a true bar clearing brawl going on and everyone trying to kick the shit out of each other and especially the bouncers as the cops ran out the door to wait for backup.\n\n10 mins later because of this one man mountain of a bouncer started saving and organizing the bouncers to support each other and work together we unfortunately got it stopped but not before leaving a wake of beaten 15-17 year olds.\n\nIt wasnt untill over 11 cop cars arrived before the police dared to try to reenter and we had already got it stopped. They ended up carting off a lot more black people once again and only a handful of white people, even after us demanding that they stop as they we arresting the wrong people and our offer to show them the video tape of the whole incident as proof. But because they now had a lot more cops and already had their ass beaten, the crowd didnt erupt again.\n\nThat was the very first time that I seen institutional racism in action along with a few others of the bouncers. We had all heard people were treated very differently by the cops but overall that was considered stuff that went on in only the biggest cities, and definately something that didnt happen here.\n\nBoy was our eyes opened that night. I never have felt the same towards the police after that, as this wasn't some individual asshole with a badge, but at minimum 18+ cops from multiple jurisdictions all being racist assholes by not even listening to security for the place in their zeal to put cuffs on black people. It was disgusting.",

Stand there and just take blows? He didn't make the decision to \"fuck those people up\".

I'm not quite sure what you think he could/should have done - or why you believe any rational person wouldn't respond similarly. \n\nI do agree with you on one point though. He's too old for this shit - in that this isn't middle school with a dumb shit zero tolerance policy that doesn't allow one to protect themselves from physical attacks. \n\nThis is the real adult world where he paid to attend an event, an event during which he was forced to defend himself from the violent, criminal behavior of two others in attendance. \n\nAgain, the fuck did he do wrong?",

I will and have done everything I can to deescalate any situation. \n\nThe way I see it, there\u2019s no need to escalate, you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re an mma fighter of some kind, and you don\u2019t know if they have a gun or a weapon. And even if I had these answers and all of that was in my favor, I don\u2019t want to seriously hurt anyone, or have them end in the hospital. Lastly, I also don\u2019t want to go to jail. \n\nThe moment the lady slaps, that\u2019s when people should move in to stop them, to wait for him to swing back, fuck that. \n\nEqual rights means equal lefts.",

I'm 6'4 and heavy built, people tend not to try and hurt me. If I didn't see what played out, the person throwing fists is priority but I'd mostly just try and be in the middle of what's going on. \n\nSo I can empathise with people making for the guy here, I'd be genuinely concerned that he'd keep going and get himself in trouble, intervening for his sake as much as anything else. \n\nI've been in a situation (fortunately, only once) where I've been attacked by random women and shit really hit the fan, had all sorts of strangers throwing hands at me for daring to push them back (literally push, after they went for me hard). I know what it's like to be on the defensive in a situation like this and someone calmly interceding is a big boon, 'red mist descending' is real shit when you're surrounded by people physically attacking you and a calm voice stepping in is good.",

If that punch to the man\u2019s head caused him to die somehow, the man who punched him could be charged with manslaughter. Order of events: woman slaps man, man retaliates with a punch, other man now in a proper case of defense attempts to fend off further retaliation, gets punched in the face while defending.

Lots of variables, questions and hypothesis and what ifs, but regardless of whether it was defense or retaliation, taunting and harassment shouldn't happen in the first place.  Two wrongs do not make a right, and too often instigators and ppl who needlessly provoke get off unpunished in the first place.  Again, it's up to society to determine if punishment is just or proportionate, on the other hand we should all just get along and not escalate and behave in entitled or uncivilized ways.  I say we ban football, because while it might be a good outlet for the athletes (or not depending on whether players get concussions and develop CTE and end up committing suicide and/or homicide),  it could be a good outlet for fans but it could definitely lead to arguments, fights, injuries and deaths because ppl can't behave in public.  Even when it's a celebration and ppl rush the field, innocent ppl end up dying, crushed to death or dying from being stomped on but I digress.",

If he were blocking a slap, I\u2019d expect him to be controlling that \u201cdeflection\u201d movement, not her.\n\nIt may be that she did make initial physical contact with one or more of her poking motions or that one of her sweeping  \u201cget out of here\u201d gestures made contact with his body, clothes, or hair that is hard to see from this angle or that occurred before the video started.\n\nI don\u2019t know if the legal line for \u2018who started it\u2019 is even a thing. But if it is, then is it defined by who started yelling first, or who approached the other with threatening gestures, or who made physical contact first. Add to that if \u2018physical contact\u2019 includes spittle coming out of her mouth if she\u2019s really close to his face.\n\nShe was definitely leaning into him and violating his personal space, and at a certain point, there\u2019s only so much you can do to avoid contact with someone.

It is *reasonable* to act in self preservation. Shooting the person would not, however, be **proportionate**. Additionally, the *reasonable* response is up to the discretion of authorities. It is not outlined in the law what a reasonable response would be, because of the variations in circumstances. This is why the law allows for someone to shoot another person in response to being punched. It\u2019s also important to recognize that a verbal assault or threats are part of the law- you can\u2019t shoot someone for *threatening* to punch you, but you can shoot someone who *does* punch you.",

You implicitly rejected that and kept arguing and talking past me as I held fast to a single, basic observation, one that you rejected at the outset.\n\nAlso, for the love of God, stop saying lethal force is justifiable with respect to a mere risk of some bodily harm.

It\u2019s a debate about whether she deserved it. Some people say yes (I do, women need to stop thinking we can physically assault men and they should just take it) and some people say no. \n\n3) A cop knowingly and willingly puts themselves into dangerous situations in which they are a higher authority. They have a responsibility to avoid abuse of said power. False equivalence and bullshit argument. \n\n4) I would argue the ones who live in la la land are the ones who *still* think men should be forced to accept abuse from women without defending themselves. If someone makes the **active** choice to hit someone, then they get to deal with the consequences of it. Doesn\u2019t matter that he turned around. She can say whatever the hell she wants. The moment *she* turned it to a physical altercation, she was responsible for her own consequences.

I think people default to \"let them solve their own problems\" until it seems like things might be really dangerous. And people tend to view women screaming at their men to be less dangerous. I mean it is less dangerous to be fair. Im not condoning what she did or saying that abuse SHOULD be tolerated, im just explaining the logic behind why people are more likely to step in when a man starts swinging vs when a women slaps somebody.\n\nAlso: thank you for being one of the few people who responded to what I was saying instead of strawmanning me or calling me a sexist.

I hate women or otherwise feel superior to them due to the fact I am commited to the process of using empirical evidence to support my views. ![img](emote|t5_2r5rp|8484)\n\nFirstly:\n\n\"In terms of absolute strength \u2013 that is, without regard for body size, weight or composition \u2013 the average man tends to be considerably stronger than the average woman. Specifically, the absolute total- body strength of women has been reported as being roughly 67% that of men.\" - Princeton, after I spent a millisecond on google.\n\nYou can read plenty of the other ways the sexes differ statistically on the handy dandy internet, like how women typically outlive men, respond to trauma better, and do better in education. You can also look at the many headlines that say \"Women are stronger than men!\" and read the articles where they quickly equivocate on the definition of strength and say things like \"women respond to stress better\" (they do) instead of actually arguing they are more physically imposing. Because they aren't. Full stop.\n\nSecondly:\n\nI at no point indicated that women were helpless damsels. \"They can work.\" ...uh yeah? No shit? What are you even getting at here? You arent talking to the fucking 1950s in human form you weirdo. I specifically said that her slap was comparatively weak to his hits, which it objectively was. I went on to point out that the different between a woman slapping someone is not the same a man punching someone. The reason is twofold. One, see the princeton quote up above. Two, a slap is almost always less dangerous than a punch.\n\nFinally:\n\nYou are a petulent child and indoctrinated by some stupid ideology if you wish to debate these empirical facts. Men are not \"superior\" to women, but yes they are objectively more dangerous in a fucking fight on average. This does not mean there are not plenty of women who can absolutely fuck somebody up, but in general it is far more rare (and those women probably would have opened with a punch or done a little bit more than throw one weak ass slap).

The black dude was way out of line here as well for his actions.\n\nAs far as I could tell, the boyfriend was just trying to stop the fight by getting in between the two, and didn't really want to fight. But the dude that got slapped wasn't going to stop throwing fists, which was way disproportionate. She slapped him so he immediately went raging fist fight? Yeah, he was eager to lash out.\n\nEven when it was obvious the boyfriend was knocked out with his head lolling there, he kept trying to pound him. If the woman hadn't gotten in the way again, he could have seriously hurt the guy by pounding on him when he was already out. So, yeah. He also deserved to get charged there in my (probably unpopular) opinion.",

But apparently nowadays, hitting women is being praised. Next post you probably judge someone for going after someone weaker. Stop being hypocrites.",

Now, I'm not saying he would actually have hit her, but if it was me, I'd also push him back to prevent him from hitting a woman, no matter if I knew her or him or if she was a Karen or not. I'm not saying she didn't wrong him, but hitting her for a slap, that's a no go, period. Call me old school, I don't care.

Also, I've seen similar situations occur here in Brazil, where \"white knights\" tried to intervene to defend women no matter the situation, even when the women were wrong, and got shot by the other man. They lived like a \"knight\", fighting for women's honor and glory and whatever medieval BS they wanted to larp, and died like a bitch, because not even their \"little princess\" they so hardly fought to defend bothered to even go to their funerals.",

Hmmmm\n\nMaking only one assumption ( black guys hand is still attached to his arm and arm still attached to his elbow , throughout the entirety of the video) ... Black dude pushed white woman first.\n\nShe defended herself . \n\nGuy who was next to blond lady stood up for her . \n\nThis was the result . \n\nAn even more unfortunate outcome from things like this, is people really jump on the ss stupid to kiss black asses , comment shit like , \" that's what Karen gets . And it breeds more stupidity . \n\nNow not only did this woman have to defend herself physically but now she has to defend herself against a bunch of racists calling her Karen and saying it's her fault yatta yatta.\n\nNow , ya don't believe me ???\n\nWanna claim I'm racest too or call me a name go ahead I'm past the third grade so names really don't bother me . \n\nWanna understand this without your blinders on .\nDo this ,.\nEdit this video in a way that color literally can't be seen or determined by any factor.  \n\nHave this edited as if each person is wearing a solid purple suit . \n\nThan share it again in a popular forum . \n\nSee the lack of comments on it apposed to here because ya know black vs white is all the trend now a days , but see what the comments are than .\n\nAnd also edit this video again in a way where the white woman looks like a black guy and the black guy looks like a white woman . \n\nThe person facing the camera lays hands first . \n\nWas it a hard dramatic swing ? , well no . But he clearly lays his hands on her during an argument with her first . \n\nIt only seems as if she hit first because she made it dramatic. \n\nI'm not sorry for saying this , wake the fuck up people i really hope the world isn't this stupid .\n\n\nOpen your eyes see what's happening right in front of you . \n\nYour all too caught up in race you can't see any different . You don't even see the actual confrontation that took place because you can't see past trying to defend a race that yes was abused by the other in the past , yes it does happen like that in present times too but this is the wrong video if that's the direction you are trying to take this . \n\nSee right and wrong for what it really is . \n\nAnd don't be offended by me correcting you . \n\nI'm not even by you I don't know you just learn what I said here and apply it to your life . \n\nNo need for likes on this comment or attack's on this comment . \n\nAll I ask is that you understand the truth you learn and do better. \n\nIt seems more and more every day the world is turning into the movie Idiocracy . \n\nOnly an even more nightmare type version of it .",

That\u2019s reflected in the actions of the police subsequently. I don\u2019t challenge that. But my advice is never raise your hands in any kind of way for whatever reason. It doesn\u2019t matter what your intentions are, it only matters what your intentions are perceived to be. That requires situational awareness. If the individual in front of you is already raising their voice and telling you to fuck off, you should be aware raising your hands could result in this. If a dog is snarling at you, you wouldn\u2019t seek to enter more into their personal space, right? We are animals as well. When the red mist descends as it clearly had at this point with this woman, you avoid anything that might escalate the situation. In this case, moving away wasn\u2019t an option given the area the row occurred in. But putting his hands up was not a good idea. This isn\u2019t about who won here, because everyone lost. This incident ruined the dreadlock guys game and day, and it ruined this woman\u2019s and her partners game, day and month most likely, and it left a sour taste in most peoples mouth who happens to witness it in real time.",

Than what is it ?\n\nAnd I'm not saying my comment about \" Karen\" being set in stone indefinitely, simply my own personal experience in life that's where it's always been directed , a white woman who complains about being not treated properly , example ( ordered a large fry , payed for a large fry , received a small fry ECT) If I'm wrong about the meaning please enlighten me to the meaning of the word used in this situation and context. \n\nI'm here to gain better understanding not only for me but in hopes others can better understand as well . \n\nHer voice I feel is being taken her concerns are being silenced by racists . \n\nA way to get the white woman off your ass and make her feel as if her concerns are unrighteous about something like her black neighbor who wants to continue getting away with throwing his beer bottles over the fence into her yard.\n\nBrainwashing her into thinking geez I really don't want to be called Karen maybe I should stop complaining and just pick them up myself.\n\nI speak on what I see and I'm not trying to piss anyone off like I said I'm here for about her understanding . \n\nWith that being said though I've been doing this a very long time and I could see right through b******* pretty quickly so if you're going to come at me with facts make sure they're true . \n\nSo please before you make another comment on this be sure of what you're saying is at the very least what you truly believe. \n\nWith that all being said I'm also not trying to sound all smart and righteous and Almighty.\n\nI really don't care about being told that I'm right or wrong if I am right and my comment about who laid hands on who first actually helps this situation fantastic but I'm not looking for money I'm not even looking for a thanks .\n\nIf my comment about watching his elbow helps anyone in this situation fantastic you could think of snail on the sidewalk and pretend that he said it I really don't care.",

Is that what we're seeing in the video? :D\nNice try with saying that the reverse would be more unlikely to happen :D\n\nSo I believe your argument isn't valid.\n\nBut actually, the reverse might be a bit more unlikely to happen. But not because the black couple would be more careful, and better at deescalating, but because, a white person knows, that if he hits a black woman in that situation, his career is basically over for good.\n\nNow, I'm not arguing, that his career SHOULDN'T be over because of that.

She swings her arm around and pushes his hand off her\n\n:04 she slaps him\n\nLook, from the perspective of this video the lady was in the wrong.  She was up in his face, he gently created some space and she then assaults him. But how do you see him blocking a swing there, who \"blocks\" a swing by literally not moving until your hand gets hit. If she was aiming for his face the first time she swings her hand around, she would have hit it because her hand passed by his face to push his arm away. I don't know what video you watched but it really seems like you're the one attempting to create a narrative here.\n\nGo back, rewatch it, pause it, rewatch it again, slow it down and rewatch it again... You're clearly wrong. Sorry",

He 'saw red'. \n\nThe whole 'men shouldn't hit women thing' isn't just an archaic tradition, it's because men can seriously hurt women. Men can seriously hurt men too, but that's seen as more socially acceptable.",

Maybe in that split second timing she senses the amount of force his hands were about to push her and instinctively slapped him. \n\nWould need more context and different camera angles.\n\nBoy friend or whoever... stands up.  Tries to put hands in btw.. black dude swats his hands with enough force instincts kick in this is an escalated situation..\n\nCan't really call her a karen unless we know what the original beef was about. \n\nYou guys need to disect the video better.\n\nEdit Ok sllowed it down 4x..\nPlay by play original correct.. he's about to shove her, she blocks, then she will smiths the man with glasses.  He instinctively about to knock her out... she sees it coming and feigns back because she realizes she's about to get jeda pinket smithed, glass dude hodls back because he realizes she's scared for her life and that she doesn't want to get jada'd... he kinda stumbles forward pulling back his punch.. bf arm goes up.. puts his hand palm out on glass dude's chest (doesn't look like an emgaging palm but hey back off) which the dude pushes away as he's trying to asses if the bf is about to attack him, palm turns into a finger.. either way glass dude is pushing away his hands because nobody wants hands on them.. now that the bf gets his arms pushed away... he's starting to become aggressive as the girl starts trying to get in btw... u can see the force he's applying trying to go forward as the girl increases pressure on him.. like a rubber band.. dude with glasses adjusts his glasses and assesses... then they both engage each other like rams as the ladies right arm comes down btw them in a hot wing chun mess..\n\nThe bf actually doesn't engage the guy until he sees his girl head jerk back probably from the glasses dude making fist contact with her... the bf gets one good shot in, doesn't look like he really wanted to fight..\n\nSo.. who's at fault? Dude was about to shove her, she intercepted (blocked) and then attacked. Should glass dude not have tried to push her away to create personal space?",
