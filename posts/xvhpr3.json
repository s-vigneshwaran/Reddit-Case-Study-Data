Now I hear some of you thinking \"who said anything about feeding them?\" Even through a mass genocide I'm pretty sure using these people as disposable mini power plants would *still* be less efficient than literally any other form of energy production. The logistics alone to handle it all would probably cancel out any energy generated by the people. I can't see any scenario where the energy output isn't net zero or worse.",

Oh and don't start me on their hardware, I am 'lucky' to have the last model of mabook with upgradable storage. Even then I needed help with some chinese adapter for their propretary ssd connector to increase storage from negligable 128gb to bearable 512gb. Also had to go straight for 16gb ram overpriced version because memory is sottered on the motherboard. Apple has great products: best screens, best speakers, lovely keyboards, greate build. But this comes in a package of anti-consumer practices like aformentioned.\n\nIt is just sad that their products could be the absolute best products on the market. From the engineering perspective their practices make little to no sense. The only thing that comes to mind is that they employ too many marketing people that want to recreate steeve jobs's famous \"revolution\". Of course it is hard to image an iPhone being overloaded with sd cards, stylus, LED indicators, frontal speakers and so on. But I kinda have to use macbook for work and yet it just does not deliever.

Assuming politics and planning you can add even more years so no way you get anything done before 2035 imo. That is too late. \n\nNow we could talk about old reactors being turned back on but they're old. Half the reactors in France are currently not supplying energy because they are old. At least in Germany the energy companies don't even want to turn their facilities back on because no reactor has been built since 1990 and they are in a terrible state. \n\nGermany overall has done awful in building renewable energies in the last 10 years. Merkel did announce a huge push for renewable energies when she left nuclear energy but her party did a terrible job in that regard. Germany isn't using a ton of coal because there is no other way. Germany is using a ton of coal because the government slept for 10 years and didn't follow their own plan.",
