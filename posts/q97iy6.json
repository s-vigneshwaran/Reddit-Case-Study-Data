Women get hundreds of messages a day with just a picture, while a man has to be Robert fucking Frost in his bio, have the perfect pictures, and play the conversation perfectly to get a single date.\n\nIn person, its even weirder. Younger women, in their 20s, really dont know how to have conversations. Online culture has poisoned these generations and social norms have changed. \n\nApproaching a woman in most settings is a crapshoot. She could get offended by being interrupted and suddenly you are the weird creep bothering people.\n\nIn the past, you could meet someone at work, at the grocery store, at the gym. Good luck these days. Youll end up in front of HR, kicked out of the gym, etc. Things have changed.\n\nThe bar is really the only option, but people go out a lot less than even just 5-10 years ago. In fact, a lot of bars around here have shut down. Young people dont drink or smoke much anymore.\n\nIm glad I'm married and dont have to date. Its fucking weird and I dont like where its headed.",
