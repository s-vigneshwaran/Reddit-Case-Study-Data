Even so, I\u2019m leaving out more detailed (long winded) information.\n\nWhen you use a VPN, it\u2019s the same as plugging in to the internet at that location.   \nI use servers in the UK, because my VPN provider has good download speeds through there. So, while the VPN is active, instead of me getting Canadian content, almost all of my content will now be fed to me as if I\u2019m in the UK.   \n\nIf I now visit a site that has a UK version of their web site, I\u2019ll get sent the UK version of the website.  \nIf I do a search for something I want to buy, the searches will give me results with retailers located in the UK. So, it\u2019s pretty much the same as me being in the UK. The VPN now puts my connection to the internet in the UK.   \n\nNow, the type of VPN protocol you use can have an affect on how easy it is to track you and access your information that you\u2019re sending/receiving.   \nIf you use a weak protocol, your encrypted connection can be hacked so that your data can be analyzed. So, you always want to use OpenVPN or Wireguard.   \n\nOpenVPN does a good job of encrypting and protecting your data and your original location information because you will be assigned a random IP address that\u2019s from the country you\u2019ve VPN\u2019d into.\nThe problem here with Wireguard, in almost all cases, is that your IP address is the same one every time. Yes, you\u2019re now showing up as connected in the UK but if the IP is being tracked, every time you use the Wireguard protocol you\u2019ll get the same IP address and you can\u2019t hide behind the fact that you\u2019re being assigned a random IP. Some providers have implemented some changes to this though.\n\nHere\u2019s some info on VPN protocols.\n\nhttps://nordvpn.com/blog/protocols/\n\nWhen it comes to speed, encrypting your connection comes at the cost of speed. OpenVPN can be as slow as about 10%-15% of your original connection speed but if you\u2019re connecting through powerful servers then the hit on your speed would be less and your throughput would be faster. So, if you have a gigabit connection to the internet and you connect using OpenVPN, your connection speed can be somewhere in the range of 100Mb-150Mb. With some VPN providers you can get much faster speeds but it will always be slower than your original internet connection speed.  \n\nIf you use Wireguard, because it\u2019s a leaner and more efficient protocol, your connection speed will be much faster. Possibly 50% faster than OpenVPN.   \nThere\u2019s no guarantee with VPN speeds. It can be affected by your computers processing speed, your internet connection speed and how powerful the server you\u2019re logged into is. So, today you\u2019re logged in and your speed is very fast but the next time you connect, you could be running through a slow congested server and everything slows to a crawl.",

Coal only makes up 21% of the electricity generated in the US (37% and dropping Worldwide). In fact, there is one other fossil fuel that out paces coal 2 to 1 in the US...natural gas. Clean burning natural gas. Then we have other clean energies like hydro-electric, thermal and even solar is making up a decent percentage. I have solar on my house and charge my plug in hydrid. I think I only use about 3 gallons a month with about 1000 miles of travel.\nAnd as far as batteries, you're comparing apples to oranges. The battery you bought for $250 was the lo-tech unreliable lead acid battery. There's no way they would ever power an electric car using that battery. And since an electric car doesn't use a big expensive, difficult to maintain extremely dirty internal combustion engine, and instead used far less expensive electric motors for propulsion, you can see how they can afford to focus on the battery improvements. My niece is still driving around my in-laws 1st Gen Prius with almost 400,000 miles and has not needed a battery replacement, I'd say they're pretty reliable.\nRegardless, the move to electric vehicles have never had anything to do with price. There used to be feasibility issues but no more. Battery technology is sufficiently advanced and price has come way down. It has always and will always be about circumventing the pollution generated from the different fossil fuels being burnt and poisoning ourselves as well as the environment.",

They'd throw me in jail for non violent crimes like eating mushrooms and exploit my slave labor happily.\n\nBut I'm also not a fucking idiot, and think critically for myself.  I even was one of the very rare people to have a serious reaction to the COVID vaccine (liver failure) - and I can understand easily that the vaccine caused my system to freak out with the intense exposure to what's in it (spike proteins or whatever) and went haywire for a week - and then got better.  Fucking sucks, but people are just fucking idiots.\n\nIt's not wizard poison, or Bill Gates.  I just don't understand how people got so fucking stupid, but maybe theres an overlap of distrustful government/stupid that I'm an outlier of.",

Hence lock downs and the effectiveness of them in countries who didn't mess around with it.\n\nAnd since you decided to ignore my other points, I'll add, that because of people like you, it's (Covid) become basically endemic, and now every year people are going to die from it. /facepunchtoyourstupidity",

Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent. But there, we see an increase of about 1.3.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nHowever, Gates\u202fwas not suggesting the global population should be killed off using vaccines.\u202fHe is\u202finstead\u202fsaying\u202fthat improving public health using vaccinations\u202fcan\u202freduce unsustainable population growth in the future \u2013 and with it, lower carbon emissions.\r  \n\r  \nThe Microsoft co-founder\u202fhas long been a proponent of population control to target the roots of poverty and unrest\u202f(here).\r  \n\r  \nIn 2011, he\u202ftold Forbes magazine that when he first entered public health it was to focus on contraception (here).\r  \n\r  \nWhen he later saw data suggesting that when mortality rates fall, so, too, do birth rates, Gates shifted his focus from preventing births to saving people already alive.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-gates-vaccine/fact-check-bill-gates-quoteabout-vaccines-and-population-growth-has-beentaken-out-of-contextagain-idUSL1N2MF1L8](https://www.reuters.com/article/factcheck-gates-vaccine/fact-check-bill-gates-quoteabout-vaccines-and-population-growth-has-beentaken-out-of-contextagain-idUSL1N2MF1L8)\n\nHe's specifically talking about this phenomenon.\n\nConnecting with large families for answers\r  \nWorking with World Vision has given me a new lens for family life around the globe. As I\u2019ve seen, there are many reasons why a family affected by poverty may choose to have many children\u2014and why poor countries have high birth rates\u2014ranging from cultural values to issues of social justice. Let\u2019s explore some of the major ones.\r  \n \r  \nHigh child mortality rates. Imagine living in a place where your children\u2019s lives are constantly threatened. There\u2019s not enough nutritious food, limited access to clean water, inadequate housing, poor health care and minimal government support. All of these factors contribute to child mortality and parents in poverty know this keenly. According to the World Health Organization, 5.4 million children under five are dying every year, with most of these children in developing countries. Faced with this reality, parents may have more kids, understanding the heartbreaking truth that some of their children simply won\u2019t survive.  \n\n[https://www.worldvision.ca/stories/why-do-the-poor-have-large-families](https://www.worldvision.ca/stories/why-do-the-poor-have-large-families)\n\nIf we reduce child mortality, poorer families will have fewer children. He did not mention yeah, let's kill off 10 to 15% of the population.",

At most it would have been 50% of them, and probably a lot less than that.\n\nThat means that if you accuse or imply that someone who had connections with Epstein had sex with the teenagers, whom we have no information on whether they actually did it, there is a high chance that the person you are spreading rumors about is actually innocent.\n\nSpreading rumors about someone, that they have had sexual relations with teenagers or children, is a very contemptible and immoral thing to do in my opinion. You probably doesn\u2019t understand how bad it is, but imagine that you were a rich and influential person who at some point got introduced to Mr. Epstein.\n\nImagine that you had no idea what kind of a person he was, but hang around with him several times.

That second generation back was the one where all 12 of the kids lived (hooray vaccines). The third, and most recent, generation is the one that remembers growing up in the kind of lifestyle where you know by heart that there are exactly 12 cakes in a little Debbie box- and only had 2 kids.\n\nHe is saying this kind of dynamic can happen in Africa and India, and probably needs to happen.",

So if we were going off of symptoms for some people for a while, why did we suddenly stop doing that and make sure to test to make sure it wasn't just influenza, and why days after Biden won was this decision made?   \nLike I've had the flu bad a few times, went to the Dr, and they check symptoms and give you meds. Only time they've actually do a thorough culture when I was sick was when it put me in the hospital with severe respiratory distress and abdominal pain, but this was years before covid and all they could say after probing and prodding me every which way was \"travelers diarrhea\" which it clearly wasn't as I hadn't traveled and my diet was consistent.   \nI'm not saying don't trust science or scientists, they are for the most part trustworthy, but to act as if science has never been caught in bed with politics is just silly.",

However, due to testing shortages and a variety of other reasons, not all persons determined to have COVID-19 have been tested.\" I could be misremembering and there was a lot of disinfo going around back then, but its nuts the hate you can get for simply asking questions and trying to understand something better.",

Who are more likely to get infected with the currently vaccinated strain? The unvaccinated. They transmit which mutates, transmits, mutates, rinse and repeat until current vaccine isn't very affective against new variant so new vaccine is created. Rinse and repeat.\n\nTexas and California? At one point they were one of the states to stay away from the most because of how hard they were getting hit. Right up there with Florida, which also took similar approach. I haven't checked the actual final stats because I just don't care anymore about this honestly. I just remember a friend taking a trip there after the state (Texas) was declaring an emergency and everyone reporting to stay away from there for the time being.\n\nAlso masks effectiveness is based on how many wear them. The mask primary goal was to protect others, secondary was yourself. Everyone kept thinking it was to protect yourself hence the \"it's my body and I choose to not wear a mask\" being stupid. You wore it to reduce what's coming out of you (how much and distance), not how much was brought in.\n\nI was actually just sick with a severe cold last week so I wore a mask to the store when picking up medicine.

It's also like how science always recorrects itself and states that hey we had our original assumption (ass u and me) but we are wrong and can admit we are wrong but this planet Pluto isn't a planet, cause it has these reasons. \n\nIf you can trust you mechanic to replace your oil at an oil change you can trust a doctor to replace medication with something a bit better. And I have met mechanic that forget to fill the oil up afterwards.",

First it was a none issue - all the way up to about the 3rd week in February. There was no planning, setting up testing, for just in case scenarios. Those are 2 huge critical errors. Followed by oh shit it's here and we don't know who has it or how wide spread it is, maybe we should start pushing out test kits, 2 weeks to stop the spread, masks aren't necessary. Oh wait, months later they are. \"According to our models\" which ALL of them turned out to be completely off. Then it was everyone needs a vaccine to reach the unicorn of herd immunity which seemingly doesn't exist considering there are countries that have extremely high vaccination rates and still are spreading it to each other in waves. I could go on and on. Seriously, if they came out and said - we got this completely wrong and here are the steps we need to take I would respected them and their integrity, but that is not what they did, and because of that they not only lost respect but the trust of many Americans. They are partly to blame for people being critical of information received from \"experts\"",

It's a process that's followed based on observation, testing, and refining. Secondly, the scientific community - all disciplines, mind you - have overwhelmingly been vaccinated. The poll in the national academy of sciences showed 97% to have taken at least one COVID vaccine (and this was probably close to a year ago). Lastly, how do you know more time is needed to ensure it's safe??? Where is YOUR research and data that says it isn't safe??? I don't \"just accept\" whatever scientists tell me. We know science works and scientists that work at credible institutions like the NIH, CDC, and NHS have stated the real side effects and the likelihood of those occurring. None of which were more likely than having a dangerous case of COVID. It's unbelievable you think you know more than they do. Fucking hilarious.",

Maybe the average person who was following the news didn\u2019t realize for a year? More?

This virus went around the world in a matter of months- Nov-Dec Wuhan, Italy outbreak shortly afterwards, NY and West Coast outbreaks already simmering in January before blowing up in early March. I live in NJ, and I had Covid Feb 28, 2020. Someone in my town was already hospitalized and died eventually. I am even pretty sure I know exactly where I got it- the Costco Sample Lady bent over double and coughed up a lung about 2 feet from me. Variants were popping up before vaccinations even got underway in first world countries- there was no way everyone was getting vaxxed and kept boosted at the same time. And with what we now know about how the vaccine allows infection and spread, even vaccinating the world once wouldn\u2019t have been enough to stop variants from arising in vaccinated people. Scientists knew that \u201cherd immunity \u201c really meant stopping the flood of hospitalized patients. They were taking about annual boosters early on- before they realized the vax doesn\u2019t even last a year.",

It can enter cells in the heart muscle and cause spikes to form on the cells of the heart, which then trigger an inflammatory response, causing myocarditis. Likewise, inflammation in the cell lining in the vascular system can lead to blood clots. It affects the ovaries, which is why so many menstrual disturbances are reported. All of this can also happen from Covid.

I doubt it's related to the shots but I just don't feel like constantly injecting myself with it (pretty much all of my colleagues got sick from the booster shots) for what? I had covid & it wasn't that bad. Worst I had was a sore throat & coughing. Big deal.. If anything I'd say it's better than the flu because at least I could breathe :p\n\nAnd glad someone finally admits people only do things out of their own benefits. People keep forgetting that society is built for the benefit of ourselves. The benefits of others is just a side affect of it. We built hospitals, why? because if I'm hurt I can get treatment. Oh others get hurt too? well good we have a hospital then. But that's not our main concern.

I just see the intense slamming of anyone not wanting this one vaccine and never saw this magnitude of detestation toward naturalists/anti vaxxers prior to covid who refuse ALL vaccines. And I wonder why there was never such an outcry all along even though they clearly were also a threat to the immunocompromised.  We didn't ridicule them for their beliefs and tell them they were crazy, stupid, and selfish and hated their neighbor. So I'm just trying to wrap my head around why we do that now, but didn't do it way before covid.",

It should be muscle memory.  Every time I get ready to start the car, it goes:  Sit down --> seatbelt --> brake pedal down --> e-brake off --> ignition.  That shit's so deeply ingrained that, if I get in the car and put on my seatbelt but then get sidetracked before starting the car, (like a phone call or something) I'll automatically try to put my seatbelt again once I'm ready to go.\n\nHearing someone say that they accidentally forget to put on their seatbelt is like hearing someone say that they accidentally forget to put the car in gear before driving.

They also protect the other people in the car with the wearer, since having someone's skull smash into your face at 40 miles per hour will kill you.\n\nAnd they **also** protect other people on the road.  Cars generally don't stop moving after the initial collision, and the driver needs to stay firmly anchored in the driver's seat so that they can try to maintain some level of control over the vehicle in the moments immediately after a collision, and hopefully come to a safe stop.  If they're ricocheting around the cabin (or have been slammed into by an unbelted passenger), and thus are unable to steer or brake, they risk hitting additional cars and/or pedestrians.",

All caused by the vaccine, that I willingly got as soon as I could.\n\nThankfully after a week, I started getting better out of nowhere, and after three weeks my liver was back to normal and for the most part I was too.  Other people had similar experiences with the Pfizer vaccine, you can look it up on US government websites or [NIH.gov](https://NIH.gov) \\- I've even read of a women who was 35 with a similar case who ended up dying a few weeks afterwards.\n\nI have no idea what the permanent damage is to my liver.  I know it certainly never fully healed, as I've had extending issues since this whole episode.\n\nI am not an anti-vaxer.

Nothing came back positive.  The biopsy showed I have severe hepatitis, but the only possible cause was the covid shot.  \n\nI think our body has worse reactions to allergies or things like vaccines a La the kindling effect.  So like I\u2019m also allergic to levoflaxin, an anti biotic.  First reaction wasn\u2019t bad.  Second reaction my lips and face swelled up.  Doctors told me the next time my throat will swell up and I might not be able to breathe.\n\nSo I imagine it\u2019s like that.  The first shot reaction caused minor flank pains in me, which could be confused for back pain from working all day.  But looking back, I definitely had a mild reaction to the first shot, and second shot took me out.  That\u2019s why I can\u2019t get a booster, third shot may very well cause full organ failure or death.",

Because on a large scale, evidence continues to show the vaccine saving lives. \n\n(For the record, I qualified my statements above with \u201chopefully\u201d etc. because yes, I know a lot of people are saying that to actively entirely dismiss the negative reactions entirely. I\u2019m looking at evidence based situations in this post specifically, not emotional based.)\n\nLike here\u2019s the thing. I\u2019m sorry that you had that massive negative reaction to the vaccine. I\u2019m honestly sad you went through that. But if I point to X% of adverse reactions, but I can also point to a much larger Y% of neutral or positive reactions, I can\u2019t justifiably say \u201cdon\u2019t pay attention to the Y% and only focus on the X%.\u201d I can say \u201cX% of people have these cases so you need to know there\u2019s risk involved\u201d and that\u2019s legitimate and needed.

I conflated the tragedy of the Cutter vaccine in the United States with the more recent contaminated vaccines in India.\n\nI thought that shortly after the Cutter vaccine problem that there is a similar contamination in vaccines in India.\n\nOne of the challenges they face is that an oral vaccine is much better suited to administration in places that have sanitation challenges and also in places that don't have the money for more training and more supplies required for injection vaccines. They're also some technical advantages to oral vaccines, like stimulating and immune response and the mucosal tissue. It's actually pretty cool. In an ideal world, we would drink a lot of our vaccines.\n\nBut because of the harsh environment of the GI tract, the vaccine needs to be a lot stronger. There need to be higher counts and sometimes non-injection vaccines. Are attenuated live virus instead of injections of dead virus. And yes, there are live attenuated injection vaccines, like MMR.\n\nIndia has obviously suffered a huge death toll and an even larger number of people with disabilities from polio. No country needed a polio vaccine more than them.\n\nBut occasionally things do happen and we don't seem to recognize that the standards could be improved, especially for vaccines sold to nations like India.\n\nHere's an interesting popular news article on varieties of polio and mutations in India:\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/why-polio-vaccine-contamination-is-a-worry/article25464166.ece",

But I just don't think it's fair to discount that sometimes people suffer real harm. If anything, the polio vaccine is a great example because despite the initial harm it did and still does save lives. The COVID vaccine may be similar in that over time we come to realize that the benefits widely out way the risk. I think we're getting closer, just checked and the US is 65-78% vaccinated (full dose and one dose.) So the majority of people have gotten it.",

The inventor of leaded gasoline knew it was unsafe, but hid his side effects; also he's the same person that invented freon, destroying the ozone layer. It's amazing trans fats are still around. What's the story behind chlorofluorocarbons, if you don't mind me asking?",

They're going to make [BILLIONS](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/pfizer-biontech-and-moderna-making-1000-profit-every-second-while-world-s-poorest#:~:text=Based%20on%20company%20financial%20statements,or%20%2493.5%20million%20a%20day.) in profit off of it! Also the government has given them complete protection so if the new drug is a horrible disaster nobody is allowed to sue them.\n\nI LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!  \n\nAnyone that doesn't love this is a total moron!!!!\n\n\n__\n\nFor the record, I'm  vaxed and boosted but I don't think people are stupid to be wary of the situation.",

The vaccine does provide immunity and lowers transmission, but NOT FOR EVERYONE, and not guaranteed. That's how most vaccines work.\n\nWe can't keep crossing people's wires though, we need as many people onboard as possible so the message gets dumbed down. Understandable honestly. Also, information changes, but with the politicized environment nobody can say \"okay new news, we're changing things\" without it literally becoming a \"we interrupt this broadcast\" moment that gets the whole country frantic.\n\nI'm not at all surprised that a partisan network like MSNBC would over-hype things but all this is besides the point, if you're getting your messages from cable news on either end of the spectrum you're getting misinformation. Meanwhile CDC and healthcare professionals have been the ones saying that vaccines are one of the best tools for fighting the pandemic and have offered the best advice as information has become available. \n\nVaccines reduce all the ill-effects of the pandemic in general. Just because it might not keep YOU personally from getting sick, on large scale it makes a massive difference. Hospitals aren't going to overload, people won't be sick as long and thus won't be spreading the virus as much, and combined with masks and basic hygiene greatly reduces the harm of a novel virus. Other countries that haven't politicized the pandemic have had great success.",

That's like being able to blow up an asteroid or deflect a solar flare, it's HUGE and it's GOOD. I don't CARE if a tiny fraction of people had some ill effects, and I don't CARE that you and your ilk are too dim to embrace the modern world, I have advocated and will continue to advocate and promote everyone I know to get vaccinated and boosted and I will continue to teach how the immune system works.

It literally took Elvis getting the shot on live TV to get people to take it.\n\nPeople have always been fucking idiots.\n\n>At that point, the polio virus had been ravaging the American landscape for years, and approximately 60,000 children were infected annually. By 1955, hope famously arrived in the form of Jonas Salk\u2019s vaccine. But despite the literally crippling effects of the virus and the promising results of the vaccination, many Americans simply weren\u2019t getting vaccinated. In fact, when Presley appeared on the Sullivan show, immunization levels among American teens were at an abysmal 0.6 percent.\n\n>You might think that threats to children\u2019s health and life expectancy would be enough to motivate people to get vaccinated. Yet, convincing people to get a vaccine is a challenging endeavor. Intuitively, it seems like it would be wise to have doctors and other health officials communicate the need to receive the vaccine. Or, failing that, we might just need to give people more information about the effectiveness of the vaccine itself.\n\n>Clearly though, those aren\u2019t winning strategies today, and they weren\u2019t back in 1956. What did prove successful was Elvis getting the vaccine in front of millions. In fact, after he publicly did so, vaccination rates among American youth skyrocketed to 80 percent after just six months",

I think people's biggest gripe with the covid vaccine (and the overall covid response) is that there seems to be a denial or refusal to acknowledge that the covid vaccine had negative reactions that weren't addressed in the same way they were for the polio vaccine.",

The vaccine was no reformulated, the government agencies released a document outlining steps on how to properly inactivate the vaccine and test to ensure activation.\n\nFunctionally, the vaccine was exactly the same pre and post 1955 but with more regulations in place for testing lots of vaccine. \n\nWith that in mind, the comparison you make to covid is fairly illogical. They are making new covid vaccines that will be better and there isnt a similar fault to address as there was to the polio vaccine. \n\nThere also isnt a denial that the covid vaccine causes adverse events. Regulators fairly quickly caught on to the signal that there was a risk of developing blood clots to AZ and most other AEs are reported regularly. I havent seen anyone saying there is no risk to the covid vaccine, its just a balance of risks.",

For COVID-19, the trial process was fast-tracked. This was shared by the news media, and this was the main cause for initial, rational boycott or protest against compulsion of vaccines. If I'm healthy, I'll just take precaution instead of voluntarily injecting the virus and risking my life.\n\nOf course, people spread rumours to gather support. Some of this was politically and religiously motivated too, and should be irrelevant. But the average person (the man in the tweet) loves to mock such cases, to appear scientific.\n\nI've known people dying post vaccination (for whatever reason), even pre-COVID.

That\u2019s in response to my post above saying, Coronavirus found in humans in 1960\u2019s. So great deduction on your part genius, that 1960 is before last year. Now you can read up on all their difference too.\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/human-coronavirus-229e\n\nI did see an MSM computational saying all kinds of BS about the Vax, as if it was going to have sterilizing immunity, but it NEVER was. And that\u2019s not what the Docs, the virologist, or scientist were saying about the Vax from the beginning.  Many of them were publicly upset with how braggadocios the drug companies were being.\nThe virologist docs were saying before the vax came out it would only lower death rates, and serious illness to help keep people out of the hospital. It did . The Vax was only \u27a1\ufe0f\u2728ONE \u2728\u2b05\ufe0f \nof many lines of mitigation, like hand washing, masking, social distancing that people need to continue.  Virologist were also saying it was most likely  going to need to be at least a 3 dose of Vax to start, but in order to come to speed up the time line they\u2019d complete testing at 2 doses to w/ a lower protection then 3 doses but help lessen the burden at hospitals and lower the mortality rate. It did and it does.\nAgain we knew from SARS (SARS-CoV1) and MERS (MERS-CoV),\nwhich are NOT your common cold coronaviruses like 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. That Covid 19 (SARS-CoV2)\nwould have a greater potential for post viral sequelae.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7850177/",

The average graduation rate of highschool has fallen significantly. In Philadelphia, Highschools have an average graduation rate of less than 50%. \n\nThats how bad our education system is. And it's not an accident. Lol. \n\nIt's not a conspiracy theory if they've already succeeded. Pol pot used the same tactic in Cambodia. Only difference is he rounded up everyone with an education and executed them.\n\nA stupid population is a good population as authoritarians like to put it.",

Of the entire population, there were 52 cases of neural cancer by their eighth birthday. \n\nThe children in the group that potentially received a contaminated polio vaccine were found to have neural cancers at about two and a half times the rate of the rest of the group.\n\nThe problems with linking this to SV40 from the polio vaccine:\n1. Maternal SV40 was found to not be linked to children getting it, so the entire premise is flawed.\n2. Neural cancer is still so rare among the entire population, and among the subset that potentially had a contaminated polio vaccine, that even with this sizable sample there is a decent chance (>5%) that there is no difference (also a decent chance that there is actually a much larger difference).\n\nThe full study also lays out several other potential explanations that are more plausible and not necessarily linked to the vaccine.\n\nAs for your third study: That study is basically just \"there was this one incident where Polio vaccines were contaminated by this one virus, isn't it possible that another vaccine might have been contaminated by HIV?\". But this isn't a reasonable argument against vaccination *in general*. It'd be like saying just because there have been cases where blood products have been contaminated in the past, we shouldn't do blood transfusions.",

It hasn't had our interest at heart for at least a century\n\nSo people are slow to believe a GOVERNMENT supported vaccine is legit, so they don't trust it. Then you go on Twitter, you do exactly what you criticized Trump for doing, and you run your mouth about shit you haven't had to worry about for years, or just plain don't understand. I wish Hollywood would just fucking burn. Useless mouth pieces.",

That claim reveals either blatant lying, or a compete failure of reading comprehension (i.e. either they're malicious, or they're stupid).\n\nHarris claimed that she'd take the vaccine if recommended to by doctors, but not if it was *only* Trump trying to push it.  Which is just common sense.  Who the hell gets their medical advice from a politician?\n\nAnd as an aside, I find this whole \"Harris wasn't going to get the vaccine because of Trump\" thing especially asinine, since Harris got vaccinated *while Trump was still president*.",

We're still discovering long covid symptoms and how the vaccine can reduce/prevent them.\n3. The population of the world was less than a third of what it is today. Population plays a big role in the spread of infectious disease\n4. There was less international travel and movement in the 1950's. This reduces infectious disease spread greatly.\n5. To go to public school, you needed vaccines. It was basically a civic duty to get them, akin to selective service. \n6. 3-5 is what *eradicates* infectious disease. People like you not understanding infectious diseases and how they work, and what it takes to generate herd immunity and eventual eradication, is exactly the reason why it will never happen.",

You have zero reading comprehension if that's what you got out of that data. 31x.001 is still only .031% chance of dying. And hospitalization rate for COVID is less than .1 for infections so 5x that is .5 and yes when people are vaccinated and boosted and not showing symptoms they are less likely to be tested and therefore more likely to spread it asymptomatically to those that cannot be vaccinated. The vaccine is basically equivalent to a vitamin shot. It doesn't prevent spread it doesn't prevent infection. Basically every other vaccine that exists had to meet those conditions to even be called a vaccine.",

By the way, why are you even talking about gates lmao, just because you think he is an authority on it doesnt mean the rest of us are that dumb. Maybe you should let people who are educated on the subject talk about it instead.\n\n>Manpower? How stupid are you? It's literally all digital data that involves a dump. They insisted on releasing it in batches because God knows why \n\nYet again, you've shown us you cant read. We know why. They told us why and anyone who knows anything about the subject already knew why. You just aren't able to read is all. It isnt just a \"digital dump\" the data had to be all read through, one page at a time, to remove all information that would violate HIPAA. How long do you think it takes to read that many pages of technical writing?\n\nMan those prices were hard to find\n\nhttps://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/the-price-tags-on-the-covid-19-vaccines\n\nI had to type it into google and everything. I guess favorable is a matter of opinion though.\n\nThe pfizer vaccine is not the first, and, if you understood immunology at all, youd understand that it was always the case with vaccines that they dont errect some sort of magic barrier that prevents all virus particles from entering your body. It is a case of the public (i.e. you) having a very skin deep knowledge of a complex subject. To put it in a physics related scenario, the layman knows a ball dropped from a plane hits the ground still under the plane while the physics major (hopefully) knows that is rarely the case due to air friction and resistance.\n\nIt is fine to \"speculate\" (though one should really try to at least use evidence). The issue is, as your comment showed, that your \"speculation\" also conveys thinking it is ok or good even to kill off all the elderly and that you clearly have no desire to be even *extremely* minorly inconvenienced to help less of them die.",

From January 27, 2022, through April 20, 2022, the number of active covid cases in the United States fell from roughly 17.5M to roughly 1.5M... Or in other words, a decline of about ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX PERCENT in just under three months [(source)](https://imgur.com/a/ArxGtEb).\n\nNow, I realize that figure is for the US, and your claim was world wide, and the data I shared isn't available in the global scope.  But what is available is the daily new infection worldwide for the same period, which also mostly declines over that time frame at roughly the same slope [(source)](https://imgur.com/a/vEBISGC), so again, your assertion that the COVID vaccines have made no positive impact are patently false.",

I get it.  I weighed the odds and took it anyway, but I absolutely understand why someone would not.  I would bet anything I own that had I not taken it - I'd still be here and be fine.  In fact I had COVID before I was ever Vax'd (was not available yet) and it was like a 2 day hangover for me.  Everyone has to decide for themselves.  Polio was a FAR different thing and was laying kids out at an alarming rate - the exact opposite of COVID.  Here's another fact - the best mind at the time once though Polio was caused by Ice Cream.  Look it up.  Just because the smartest people come to a theory - it does not make it correct.  They are just doing the best they can with the info they have at the time.  I'm glad we have them and they do it - but their word is not gospel.  They'd be the first to tell you that.",

                          "text": "Sure. As most of the vaccines differ, I will be primarily looking at the Moderna vaccine, which is a mRNA vaccine. It is safe because mRNA is not a new field of science, and has been extensively researched for decades before COVID. Also, the mRNA never enters the nucleus of a cell, where the DNA is stored, therefore it cannot change our genes or turn us into crocodiles.\n In simplest of terms, upon injecting the vaccine into a muscle, the fluid which is composed or the mRNA, travels through it and enters the muscle cells, where it  'teaches' our cells how to make a specific protein, the same one which is found on the surface of a COVID-19 virus. The cell breaks down the mRNA, essentially getting rid of it. As you learned in school, proteins are all of a specific shape, therefore when the cell which has learned to create the protein displays it on it's surface, the body's immune system recognizes that it is foreign, which triggers an auto-immune response, essentially an alarm that a foreign entity has entered the body, which in turn causes our immune cells  to create a multitude of different antibodies with a specific shape. Once it finds one that matches the active site of the protein, it uses it in order to fight what the body thinks is a 'virus'. During this process, memory cells are created which remember the specific antibody, in case this 'infection' ever occurs again. Thos prepares the body and when the time comes when your body becomes infected with the actual virus, it recognizes the proteins on the surface of it, and creates the correct antibody, basically neutralizing the risk of becoming seriously sick due to covid.\nThis is all basic knowledge that you learn in school, albeit I did research prior to making this comment in regards to it's safety, as I used to actively engage with conspiracy theorists. I hope this answers your question and I hope you have a nice day.",

People lose the ability to see when they're fucking up because they believe they're so pious.\n\nIf you believe unreason is the basis of all truth, EVERY belief you have gets skewed by wishful thinking and general horseshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey had a study that required atheists and religious folks to identify basic facts (which everyone should know) and falsehoods, and as we all know, religious folks had a very tenuous grasp of reality.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think, at this point in history, with all the harm that religion has done;  that we're far too tolerant of it.  They should be treated as a lesser person, most of them are dumber than children and it causes problems with every facet of society.\n\nThey should be treated as the intellectually and morally bankrupt dolts that they are.",

Getting covid while vaccinated was called breakthrough because it was supposed to be so rare. It isn't. \n\nPeople are not almost always asymptomatic. My covid symptoms post vaccination were worse than when I got it in 2020. I knew triple vaxxed people who were sick for weeks.\n\nIt's only recently that the rhetoric changed to \"you'll still get it and transmit it so it only protects you but it still needs to be required so you don't give it to other people but you still can\"\n\nThe entire narrative around the vaccine has been gaslighting and its shocking how you have been so fooled",

This means that it also helped protect those around them. The covid vaccines allow for just as high of a viral load as non vaccinated.  This does not protect others. Only the vaccinated\n5.)

The largest being how little of the thousands and thousands of pages of testing have been released and there was a huge push to delay most of the information well beyond a reasonable number. The information that has been released is redacted to remove some key information. \n\nAnother point of contention is how risky is covid vs getting a shot that you cannot get the full information on. For a healthy child to adult the risk of covid was very low and the shot has offered very little to no protection from mutation to mutation. The shot also did not stop transmission of covid so you could not achieve heard immunity through it. All of this information swayed a lot of public opinion. \n\nThen we get to masking, the idea was masking protected people around you. If masks worked then the shot became irrelevant. Wether that statement is fully factual or not doesn\u2019t matter it\u2019s an opinion people had about it. There\u2019s also the wild problem of masks that most people purchased claimed they did not protect from covid. \n\nFinally I\u2019ll stop with no one trusts the government. The left doesn\u2019t trust the right and vice versa. Most people in the middle only have a small amount of trust to either side. Our government has failed on us most fronts in the passed few decades from things as easy as drinking water to trying to not divide an entire country simply based on politics.",

Back then, cases of meningitis were being counted as \u201cpolio.\u201d Just like 2 years ago, when flu cases were being counted as \u201ccovid\u201d and the sensitivity of the PCR testing was adjusted, conveniently, at the right times. Oh, and don\u2019t forget that the definition of the word \u201cvaccine\u201d was changed to settle the arguments that were against the current mRNA shots being an actual vaccine by definition.\n\nRemember kids, never let a good crisis go to waste. Whether that crisis is real or man made \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc\n\n![gif](giphy|83QtfwKWdmSEo)",

          "text": "The variants are mutations in the virus.  This is common among viruses, has nothing to do with the vaccines.\n\n A virus is essentially just a bit of genetic information encapsulated in a protective coating.  Some viruses have a very weak protective coating and cannot live long outside of a host.  Others, like the corona virus, are more hearty and can survive for some time before they break down.\n\nWhen the virus enters a host organism, it attaches to cells and is absorbed into them.  When this occurs, its genetic information inserts itself into the cell's genetic information and causes the cell to create copies of the virus which are then released to infect other cells. \n\nThis is where the variants occur: because the process of copying the genetic data is often not perfect.  While healthy cells are pretty good at making accurate replications, when this foreign genetic material is inserted, it doesn't always happen cleanly.\n\nGenetic information is stored in DNA and RNA chains.  These are made up pairs of four nucleobases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine.  Adenine pairs with thymine, and cytosine with guanine.  Groups of these pairs called genes encode the instructions for the production of proteins.  If a single nucleobase in a gene is changed, the protein created by its instructions will be wrong.  In MOST cases this will either produce no effect or, if the protein is critical to the replication of the virus, will lead to it failing to reproduce.\n\nBut occasionally the mutation is beneficial to the virus and leads to an enhancement, such as a more durable protective coating or a different method of binding to cells (e.g. the so-called \"spike protein\").  If enough of these beneficial (to the virus, not to the host) mutations occur, then it will produce a new variant of the virus.\n\nThis is how SARS-CoV-2) came into being in the first place.  A previous variation of the virus that was not infections to human beings mutated in such a way that it became able to infect humans. \n\nAs for the human trials of the Covid vaccines, there were human trials.  They were conducted in a more rapid way.  This was possible due to the massive amounts of funding available.  The steps were followed rigorously (at least in most cases).   They were expedited, and it's possible that the data from the trials may not have been analyzed as deeply as would be the case in normal cases, but this was balanced against the large losses of life that were occurring due to the virus.\n\nAs for guarantees that they would work, that's what the tests were for and confirmed.  The level at which they would work was not entirely certain, but the fact that they were effective to some extent was demonstrated by the trials.\n\nAs for the people who'd gotten vaccines being most at risk, where do you get that idea?  In fact, people who were previously vaccinated were much less at risk of the follow-on variants.  And those who had breakthrough infections were far less likely to develop severe and deadly infections of the virus.  In some cases it may seem like those who'd been vaccinated were more at risk, because those who were vaccinated first were those most at risk to begin with, and if and when they were infected, there was a higher chance of their developing a severe case than those who were not at as great a risk.  There were also more reports in the media concerning cases among the vaccinated as that was more \"newsworthy\" than cases among the unvaccinated.  Since widespread release of the vaccines, the largest numbers of severe and deadly cases have been among those who were not vaccinated.\n\nThe only thing accurate in your statement is that the trials of the Polio vaccine lasted about 2 years.  However, the first trial was on a a small number of adults and children.  It occurred on March 26, 1953.  Two days later the results of its success were published.  The next test occurred in February of 1954, when children at two locations in Pittsburg were vaccinated.  A couple months later, a trial of 1.8 million children was conducted, with about 450,000 receiving the vaccine, about 200,000 receiving a placebo, and about 1.2 million receiving neither to serve as the control group.  One year later, on April 12, 1955 9actually a couple weeks shy of 1 year after this mass trial), the results were announced and the vaccine went into widespread use.\n\nBut even then, there were hiccups.  The vaccine was only about 60-70% effective to begin with.  And there were a few cases of bad batches of the vaccine which actually caused cases of polio, leading to about 200-300 deaths.  This was due to the vaccine does in question not using a deactivated version of the virus. \n\nSo far, the number of complications in individuals receiving one of the covid vaccines have been very small.  About 5 cases in one million doses has caused anaphylaxis.  Thus far, there have been about 15,000 deaths among individuals who received a covid vaccine (a rate of about 0.0025%), but very few, if any, have been directly linked to the vaccine itself.  \n\nThe numbers clearly show that the Covid vaccines have dramatically reduced severe and deadly cases of the disease.  Unless you have a specific reason you should not take it (and there are some, though very few, people for whom this is the case), the odds of you developing a significant complication are far less than the odds of you developing a severe case of Covid without being vaccinated.\n\nI personally have had 3 doses of the Moderna vaccine (the normal two dose initial vaccination and a 6-month booster).  About a month after my booster and shortly after returning from spending Christmas in Dallas with my brother's family, I got word from my sister-in-law that she had tested positive.  My wife and I both went and got tested as quickly as we were able to.  While my wife tested negative, I was positive.  However, I suffered no symptoms whatsoever.  Due to my high blood pressure, however, I'm considered at an elevated risk.  Still, the worst I've suffered was the day or so of feeling awful after the second and third days of vaccines - a reaction caused by the body ramping up to fight the virus it thinks it was just infected with.  It's impossible to say what would have happened had I not been vaccinated, but I've known people in better healthy than I who've been hit hard by it.\n\nAgain, unless you've got a specific reason why you shouldn't (e.g. those allergic to specific components of the vaccine and some individuals with autoimmune diseases), your chances of having any significant adverse reaction are far, far less than your risk of a severe or deadly case of Covid.",

From there, I developed RA some other issues. \nMy husband also developed nerve pain and could not lift his right arm for months. \nYet, when we brought this up and tried to get help , we were hit with a brick wall of misinformation,  ignorance and a clear rejection of any discussion relating to correlation with vaccine,  which makes getting help difficult. My husband also had mild inflammation of outer layer of heart but that resolved quickly but as I said, what to do ?\nClearly there are many people who believe in science and are cognisant of the triumph of vaccines and medicine but then there is us...what box do we fit in ?",
