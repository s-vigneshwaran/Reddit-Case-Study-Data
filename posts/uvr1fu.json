  "text": "TIFU by misusing a whiteboard for 1 1/2 years.\nI bought a whiteboard when I moved into my new and current house. This was supposed to be the ultimate pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance to my awesome new home office. It took a few months to ship, and when it finally did, I was pretty unhappy with it. First of all, there was this big crack behind it, bending the metal in an unsatisfying way, but it wasn't that noticeable so I didn't bother sending it back. The worst, though, was that it was near impossible to write on it without leaving ghost marks. And you can forget about letting some writing on it more than 24 hours.\n\nAs a result, I wound up not using it for most of the last year. Basically, his only purpose was as a magnet holder, when it should have been used for so many different projets. \n\nToday, as I finally had some free time, I looked into the process of cleaning my whiteboard, and making it more usable. As I applied some store bought cleaner, I found this small tear in some kind of plastic coating. I freaked out, ripped it all out and came to the horrifying conclusion that I spent 1 1/2 years writing on plastic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI now have a brand new, unused board that has been sitting in my office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl;dr: bought a whiteboard, forgot to take the plastic layer off and took way too long to figure it out\n\n[EDIT](https://imgur.com/a/zID4BuO)",

So yeah either willful ignorance or a weird power trip.\n\nI ended up ignoring her as much as possible and so she dobbed me in to the big boss saying I wasn't helping her. I explained that she interrupts my actual proper work numerous times for something she can easily do herself. She must've got reprimanded for it though as the requests stopped coming... \n\n... except for the time she asked me to print the entire contact DB with easily 100k+ contacts spanning a decade, so that they could manually look up each contact in the very same contact DB to see when the contact was last contacted - instead of actually asking me to just give them that uncontacted list in the first place. It was only after I dumped a phonebook sized pile of contacts that I asked wtf they needed this crap for and ended up printing a much smaller pile for them to go through. I still don't know why they didn't just use Excel and allow themselves to sort/filter the data as required. But sometimes there's no helping people.",

Kid was \"creative\". Ended up selling her an Epson inkjet printer with some t-shirt xfer paper (the iron on stuff). To put timeline into perspective, printers were, at the time, *just* beginning to transfer from parallel port to USB. Must've answered, \"yes, it'll work with the new computer,\" a million times. Anyhow, by 5:15, she was on her way, presumably happy.\n\nEnter Boxing Day (for you Americans, it's the day after Christmas and was basically our \"Black Friday\" before retail imported your retail holiday here [which is stupid, as we don't celebrate Thanksgiving at that time; but I digress)]): No returns. Sign is clear as daylight. Nevertheless, customer comes back with the printer in its box that is beaten to HELL and back -- a truly sadistic and extra tortuous variant of Hell, to be precise.\n\nShe storms to the front, where I'm tending to cash (associates at this store did everything), and claims I sold her a, \"defective piece of junk and *ruined* Christmas.\" Boss tries to defuse, saying, \"while we don't normally do returns, blah blah, go to the back, mister_newbie will take a look at the printer.\"\n\nI go to the back. What I see is little threads jammed up in the printer's rollers. Customer put the xfer paper atop a tshirt and force fed both through the printer; then trimmed the shirt off and was trying to return her fuck-up. I report this to boss man, he laughs her out of the store.\n\nIt was that day, in my personal headcanon, that the facepalm meme was born.",

Trying to explain to her the difference in 50% off and buy one get one free almost put me in an insane asylum. Of course, boss comes over and gives her what she wants \"just this one time\".

Then again, I do understand not wanting to deal with crazy people feeling like they've got a personal vendetta against your business and have them harass the shit out of you.",

It wasn't until OVER A YEAR LATER when my friend came over she peeled off the blue plastic. We were AMAZED! Haha we are idiots.",

I've had to replace multiple, whereas before I had a smart phone shatter and the screen glass fell out and it became unusable. Each hit for the screen breaking would be 100$. If I broke the protector 10* I'm at 80$ expensed, but if I broke the screen 1* it would've been 20$ more.\n\nAt the end of the life of the phone, I only sell mine if I don't have someone that can use it (I've upgraded when either apple had made things essentially a brick due to sys updates and when I filled up my memory on the device even though I have a couple cloud storage accounts, and my prior phones are all three still in use or in like new condition). Out of 3, I only sold one, and iirc it was an apple 8, because it didn't have the correct radio chip to work with Verizon. My mil got my 7 when I upgraded to 8, she was going to get the 8 too. She used the 7 until FALL LAST YEAR. My husband inherited my old Pixel 3 (he hates \ud83c\udf4e and had a basic phone because he doesn't care) when I got the 6 last year. The 7 still looks new out of box NOW (MIL is more careful than I am), and the 3 survived being dropped on the floor in a dark ride at DISNEY with everyone walking over it. The 8 I sold got 250$... In 2020. Plus, I can replace the protector myself and not have to trust someone else with my device. Any time I have to have to screen replaced, I would be leaving my phone and all it's info with someone else. Even if it was a net financial loss instead of benefit, hell, the convenience is worth it.",

Even naked phones often would survive many drops before actually giving way. Each drop might not immediately cause visible damage, but many of these drops do affect the structural integrity of the frame and glass panel, until one day it gives way.\n\nWhat most regular phone cases and screen protectors really does protect is against scratches and minor dents when you drop a phone. They barely add any structural integrity to the device, which means it barely helps to protect the screen from cracking when dropped. Unless you're going to resell a phone, these little dents are of little concerns, as they don't affect the functioning of the phone, so most people aren't going to replace a phone just because it has one or two small scratch. But most people would replace a phone when the screen cracked, which isn't being helped by screen protectors/cases.",

I\u2019m not selling these old shit box things on, they barely work by the time I\u2019m done with them and/or are obsolete. \n\nAnyway, the screen protectors do indeed smash before the screen and at like a tenner to replace versus around a hundred quid for what I have now it\u2019s a no brainer. When my brother first gave me this one it had no case on it. Just the screen protector. I dropped it and smashed the back (and it\u2019s still smashed now under the case I bought because I don\u2019t really care it\u2019s not in the way) but the screen did not smash.

Your actual screen and the device frame is still taking microscopic damage either way.\n\nIf your phone survived a drop with a screen protector, it'd have survived that drop without a screen protector as well. If your phone cracked without a protector, it'll have cracked with a protector as well. The protector isn't making the device more durable, you're just adding another part that can break.\n\nCases and screen protector are just attachments on the device. It doesn't substantially change the amount of forces that the frames had to resist on a drop. Screens gets cracked when the structural integrity of the frame is compromised, adding a case or a screen protector doesn't change that forces.",

Basically I have unlimited texts and calls etc, with the very latest Samsung galaxy phone, for only \u00a320 a month. It's a deal that they don't even advertise, cos it's so good (for the customer). They offered me more expensive contracts, until I asked them about trading my old one in, at which point they begrudgingly said that yeah that's an option, if I want.\n   \nWe are running out of gold. Smartphones need gold to be able to work. So that's why phones these days are recycled. They collect all the gold they can from it to re-use it in new phones. Your current phone is made from the corpses of other phones.\n   \nIf you see videos of these gold reclamation factories, it's insane. Like for example, at the end of every shift, they have to rub their shoes on a big brush thing, to collect the miniscule amount of gold dust that's on their shoe soles. That's how big of a deal it is. They surely get barely any gold from the gold dust on their shoes, yet they still make a big effort to do it anyway.\n  \nConsidering that all the gold in the world put together couldn't even fill up an Olympic size swimming pool, and how necessary gold is to everything electronic these days, including PCs and game consoles and TVs etc as well as smart phones, we're possibly heading for a big crisis, like the current silicon chip shortage that's going on, but probably even worse. They'll have to come up with some new metal that isn't so rare, but can perform the same function as gold does, perhaps some new alloy, because people are always messing around and accidentally stumbling onto awesome new alloys.\n    \nBut yeah until then... \n   \n#Trade your phones in! \n   \nIt saves you a ton of money. And as you say, otherwise it'll just sit in a drawer for years and you forget it exists, so you might as well trade it in and get tons of money off of your next phone. \n   \nAnd you could probably make money from selling your old computer CPUs and graphics cards etc too. I'm sure that gold reclamation companies would be interested in them, like they are with phones. CPUs in particular use a lot of gold.",

This means that while it may be true that you're on the latest version of the system, you may not actually have the latest features like those that are actually on the latest devices. \n\nOn the other hand, Android often have a shorter period of system upgrades on paper, but that doesn't actually really matter. Most of Android upgrades that actually matters to people are delivered in Google Play anyway, rather than as system upgrades. And you get updates from Google Play indefinitely. Even for features that might initially look like system features, they are often really just a regular application in Android. This means that Android can actually remain viable even long after they officially are no longer supposed to receive system updates.",

I\u2019m not tech support, but part of many of my days at work is spent fixing something for someone either by hitting the ESC button, plugging things in correctly, or suggesting they restart. \n\nMy favorite story is when one of my coworkers came out of his office looking totally confused. He said the website was messed up. So I went to it on my computer, nope it\u2019s totally fine. I ask what is wrong, and he said something about how everything was small. \n\nSo I go into his office, and yes, the website is small, because for some reason he was zoomed down to 20%. So I fixed the zoom for him and he was ok after that. \n\nI went on vacation once and someone hadn\u2019t been able to use one of their monitors for a couple of days when I got back. Even our tech support had troubleshooted and couldn\u2019t figure it out. So I went in, checked the outlet and it was plugged in, just not far enough. Problem solved. \n\nI am thinking about making a checklist for people of basic things they need to check before calling the tech people. Tech people assume the problem is complicated because by now they assume people in the office are savvy enough.",

Almost always the issue.\n\nThe funniest time though was when they couldn't get a car to continue running. It would start and run for a few moments when sprayed with ether, then it would choke and stall, refusing to start again until they sprayed more in. They checked the fuel pump and several other things because it was obviously not getting fuel. Eventually I had to ask, did you put gas in it?",

Just doesn't exist \ud83d\ude14 \nHis brain doesn't work that way, where he can think about the most simple, or easy/everyday facts/tasks, and just do it etc, his brain will literally close off to that side, and focus on what is most key to him \ud83d\ude02 \n\nA funny example that gets our family laughing: if he's going to the shop for bits and bobs, he would ask what we needed (baring in mind, I would never give more than 5 items for him to remember), and he would always forget at least 1 item or 2. So, I started telling him what items were needed... But also the number of items he was getting, so he'd focus on the number side, and then ratch in his brain for the item names then. And it works every time now!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\"So we need this, this and this... So three items boo\". Him: \"three things, three things, got it!\" - our daily life, for absolutely anything that would be \"everyday\" things. But anything else, and he's Chuffing Einstein! \ud83d\ude02 \n\nNow we have a shopping list app that we can both add to on our phones, so works much better haha!\n\nI love him and his brain so much, he's so fascinating \ud83e\udd70",

There are x number of switches, two there, two there, three there, and so on. Helps when I change things around too since it's easier to adjust the numbers instead of forgetting to turn on the new light fixtures most days.",

If I could, I would still rather keep the film on though, for the exact reasons you explained (and it extends to other things too, I remember how devastated I was as a child when my parents washed the new bedding they got me and it lost its fresh from the packaging creases and new smell. I think it's a lot to do with how much we dislike change, these actions change an item, and I like things to stay in there \"original\" for as long as possible).",

But he couldn\u2019t figure out how to get this thing programmed! Couldn\u2019t get the screen to change at all. \n\nI\u2019m sure you know where this is going. \n\nI get to my grandparent\u2019s house and they\u2019re both going over the manual with a magnifying glass. Looking for clues, I guess. I take one look at it and see it\u2019s got a protective layer that has 12:00 printed on to it. I kinda giggle, pull back the plastic, and hand it over. He starts busting up laughing, my grandma buries her face in her hands. They apologize for making me drive 20 minutes over to pull back a piece of plastic, but I was happy to help.",

Dejected, he swallowed his pride and asked me, his daughter, an \"art student\" with whom he, an electrical engineer, likes to compete, to help him. He then retired to his room.\n\nI went to the TV room and immediately realized that I had a big one in my arsenal against him now. After fixing things, I went to his room, anticipating my victory with each foot step, only to find him wiping the sweat off his forehead. The little girl in me couldn't proceed with my gloating plans, her voice screaming in my head 'papa asked us for help! This will be a nice memory. Don't screw it up!' \n\nSo, I did what any child of borderline narcissistic parents would do. I went in and told him it was fixed. Very much surprised at my quickness, he asked, 'what? But how?' I told him he was right. The cable was busted and I put in a new one. He thanked me profusely and I walked back to my room with the two tiny ass silicon caps, snug in my moist fist.\n\nI thought I didn't say anything about the caps because I didn't wanna rub his defeat in his face. But upon further reflection, I realized that now, everytime he can't get an optical cable with a cap connected, he's gonna come to me. Idk if I want to be needed, or I want to feel proud... We'll never know.",

Proper glass whiteboards are pretty pricy, but you can jerry-rig your own by just using a large (i.e. 4' x 3') picture frame. I've found it's pretty easy to find them used on Craigslist or Facebook marketplace. You can either just put a plain white sheet in the frame, or if you're using it for kanban or something else, you can print out diagrams and put it in the frame so that they can't be erased.",

Then lost my job so couldn\u2019t afford to replace it, but I definitely \\*was\\* going to \u201cas soon as I could\u201d and was too stubborn to just accept that it was my dishwasher. Then I gained a housemate that turned into a boyfriend and I left it to see how long before he said anything. Which he never did. He said he thought I was one of those weird \u201cleave it on indefinitely\u201d types so he just chalked it up to that. Then two years of isolation and depression and earlier this spring I was like fuck it, I\u2019m finally taking it off!     \n\n\n\nAnd immediately found out (good) news that I have to sell my house and move out of state.

I went to the local shop for some stuff one evening\u2026 and then as I was queuing to pay\u2026 some random dude was stood there with a white board of the perfect size. It\u2019d been heavily used but was in good condition and covered in permanent marker. I asked the dude where he got it\u2026 and he said \u201cThey\u2019re closing my office so I took it. They had loads. They won\u2019t notice.\u201d So I said \u201cAwesome. Could you steal one for me? I\u2019ll pay you.\u201d He said \u201cTake this one. I\u2019ll just get another tomorrow.\u201d \u201cHow much?\u201d I said. \u201cJust take it he said.\u201d And that was that.

The dishwasher in the store and what we got looked the same, the top had the control panel, with a shiny metal strip under the panel and the rest of the dishwasher was a matte metal, not shiny. So after two weeks, I found scratches on the matte metal part of the dishwasher, from lowering the dishwasher on a footstool I thought. I was distraught, warned my spouse to be more careful, and was upset we scratched the dishwasher so soon after purchase. After reading much online how to fix scratched metal, I tried many things; I used toothpaste and toothbrush to get rid of the scratch(it made it worse), looked at magnetic and sticker coverings(too expensive and flimsy), and finally covering the matte metal with vegetable oil. The vegetable pot worked, it made the metal shiny like new again and almost hid the scratches. There were negatives about this, the cats started licking the dishwasher, the cat hair started sticking to the dishwasher, and I had to wash and reapply the oil weekly. After a month or two, the dishwasher, the matte metal part, started getting bubbles, they grew over time and I couldn't squeeze them out! That's when I got fed up and asked my spouse to call the store and company to ask about warranty coverage. I was hesitant because I thought I caused it by scrubbing it with oil and toothpaste. After contacting the store, that sent us to the company, and finally we got a person who was very confused about our bubbling dishwasher. They said it must be user error. We insisted on showing pictures. Next day we sent pics and called back, they forwarded us  to the tech department only to be asked of we took the protective peeling off. My spouse was red from embarrassment, said thank you and hanged up. Turns out, the scratched part was the protective coating, and I was cleaning/buffing/oiling the protective layer. It looked brand new when we peeled it off. I was very happy but spouse was very embarrassed. We had a good laugh.\nIn my defense, the dishwasher looked like that at the store and the protective layer was not light blue that I am used to seeing. And I thought the matte metal thing was the \"finger print resistant layer\" the dishwasher was boasting about.",

I understand if it's a team of people it makes it easier to show things to others and collaborate, but if it's me alone, isn't a notebook better?  it stays there, no need to take pictures before erasing, etc.  Is it a Hollywood thing or do people really use whiteboards in their room?",

With a whiteboard everything is directly in front of your eyes. Like trying to see \"the big picture\". Another point of \"out of sight - out of mind\" could apply here, e.g. If I don't see my to do's for the week constantly in front of me, I forget half of it. A notebook sometimes is not big enough of a surface.\n\nThis may not apply to everyone using whiteboards, but I hope it helps you understand why some people prefer them.",

I found a whiteboard delivered to my residence after such circumstances. It sat unused from 2018 until the recent Fall semester when my sister started med school.\n\nShe was advised to incorporate a whiteboard into her study habits and I was happy to gift her mine so that I could redeem at least one purchase from the ill fated spreadsheet. After using it for a couple of weeks, she complained of the quality of the pen or the fact that the whiteboard ink didn't stick well, was faded after writing. During one of her vigorous attempts at removing the writing from the board, she noticed some of the surface start to bulb up. Knowing that I had had the board for several years at this point, she asked me how often I had used it, and if I had bothered to remove the plastic covering. \"What plastic covering?\" \n\nSure enough, after peeling away the protective layer of plastic that I failed to notice, the whiteboard pens and ink both work quite well, and have become an integral part of her study routine. So ya, you're not alone in this TIFU discovery and if this thread is any indicator, there are literally dozens of us...",

The boards get addicted to the stuff, and the sprays are a scam: once you use it, you can only use more of it. Solution: wipe the board with some water, and lo-and-behold, board in clean! Addiction solved..",
