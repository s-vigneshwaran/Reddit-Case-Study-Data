Sorry if there was too much jargon.  \n\n\nMoving electrical currents create a force that we know as magnetism. Electrons are charged and are the source of the current in magnetic materials, but their movement is a \"spin\" in a certain direction. You have a bunch of unpaired electrons from a bunch of atoms spinning in one direction to create a force that can affect other materials. Other materials, mostly metals, with unpaired electrons will be attracted to this force, anything with paired electrons (everything) resist that force although this resistance is about 1000x weaker than being attracted to it. The fact that the attraction is much stronger means we can stick your fridge magnet on the fridge since there is metal on your fridge door, but you aren't being repulsed by the same amount every time you try to pick up a magnet. This can also explain why some metals don't let magnets stick on, they are some sort of alloy that makes all the unpaired electrons pair up in their bonding.",

Electrons are charged and are the source of the current in magnetic materials, but their movement is a \"spin\" in a certain direction. You have a bunch of unpaired electrons from a bunch of atoms spinning in one direction to create a force that can affect other materials. Other materials, mostly metals, with unpaired electrons will be attracted to this force, anything with paired electrons (everything) resist that force although this resistance is about 1000x weaker than being attracted to it. The fact that the attraction is much stronger means we can stick your fridge magnet on the fridge since there is metal on your fridge door, but you aren't being repulsed by the same amount every time you try to pick up a magnet. This can also explain why some metals don't let magnets stick on, they are some sort of alloy that makes all the unpaired electrons pair up in their bonding.  \n  \n>  \n>Copied from my other comment to expand on my answer\n\nAs for why it creates this force, someone (probably a physicist, I'm a chemist) more qualified than me might be able to answer better. Essentially it's a natural force of our universe, charged particles moving creates a force because other charged particles react. When you realize pretty much everything is made up of charged particles (or at least contain charged particles like electrons and protons), then it makes sense that moving a charged particle would create a force that other charged particles feel.   \n\n\nHope that helps.",

If changed in just the right way they can create a self-propagating electromagnetic wave (aka light). \n\nThe electrons orbiting around the nucleus generate a magnetic moment that is both parallel to the axis of rotation, and perpendicular to the plane of rotation (the North Pole being in the direction the magnetic moment is pointing). \n\nIn less magnetic materials the magnetic moments mostly point in different directions cancelling each other out. While in more magnetic materials (like iron) their magnetic moments point in the same direction when subjected to a magnetic field. The more the magnetic moments align, the stronger the magnetic field. \n\nA permanent magnet (which I believe is what you were referring to) is a magnetic material where a self-sustaining magnetic field can be induced. There are various to way to induce a permanent magnetic field including using electricity, heating to a specific temperature, and using other magnets.",

The heat makes the sun want to expand (like an exxplosion), but gravity makes the sun want to collapse in on itself. What  we see is the balance between those two forces, gravity and thermal expansion. In a while, the fusion reaction will begin to happen faster, causing more heat, and tilting the balance in favor of expansion. Then the sun will expand so large that its surface will reach earths orbital distance and engulf the planet. This will be sub-optimal for anyone remaining on earth.",

Then the sun will begin to contract rapidly, getting hotter as it does. When it shrinks down past its current diameter, it will begin to fuse heavier elements for the first time. It will become quite small, and super hot.\n\nIf it had 3 or more times its current mass, it would continue collapsing to a single point with 0 diameter, encased in a relatively cold maelstrom of gases and elemental particles, and become a black hole.\n\nBecausd its mass isnt quite enough to form a black hole, it would instead get crazy hot and begin to expand again much faster than before, fast enough that its surface matter will exceed its escape velocity, and it will shed a good portion of its mass out i to space forever. Then finally it will cool down and contract again, settling in to become a small white dwarf with a diameter about 10 times tbat of jupiter. Then it will gradually stabilize and cool down until it goes dark forever.\n\nFirst he start big, then he go smol (you are here), then he get big, then he get smol again, then oh lawd do he explode, then he get tiiny for long time, then the sweet embrace of death.",

That's quite a weak force -- you can separate chemicals in solution with just a few volts, for example when chrome-plating. Fire just puts elements back with oxygen.\n\nThe Sun's nuclear reactions work in the central part of the atoms, which is made up of protons and neutrons. Those bonds are much more powerful than the chemical ones -- they are actually called the Strong Interaction or the Strong Nuclear Force. So they release much more energy when they are rearranged.\n\nWeirdly, the Strong interaction shows up at both ends of the elements. When Hydrogen gets forced together, it makes the heavier Helium and releases a lot of energy. When Uranium-235 blows apart, it can do that in various combinations of lighter elements (plus some spare neutrons that make it a chain-reaction), and also releases a lot of energy per atom. Somewhere in the middle -- with Iron -- you get an element that just does not contain any more energy: it is at the bottom of the curve.",

A star continues to fuse elements until it eventual runs out and moves on to the next heavier element. It continues on in this manner until the reactions can no longer sustain the star. Eventually the star collapses to a dwarf, explodes in a super nova, forms a neutron star, or forms a black hole depending on stellar mass. When a star goes super nova the elements it has created are scattered across vast distances. The iron in your blood was made in a star. You are made of stars.",

I studied Earth and space science in undergrad, but even I am only slightly less retarded than most people.\n\nThe core of a star is in a balance between the pressure of gravity pushing in from all of the material outside of the core and the force of nuclear energy radiating out of the core due to fusion. Each element produces progressively less energy from nuclear fusion, so hydrogen produces the most, then helium, and so on. Once a star runs out of the most efficient fuel source (usually hydrogen) the balance in the core changes. This results in a bunch of changes, but what's most important is that the star gets hotter and expands. The outer material of a star can expand so much that it gradually pulls away from the gravitational pull of the core and the surrounding star material. This leads the star to swell even more and eventually the outer layers get blown out into space by solar radiation. Once the core has been able to fuse everything it can (for the most part) it will become a white dwarf and all of the expelled material becomes a planetary nebula. This is what happens to stars 8 times the size of our sun or smaller. Any bigger and the star will end in a supernova. So even though the death of our sun will cause it to swell up so much that is swallows all of the inner planets, it's an actually pretty slow and gradual death on astronmic scales.\n\nFun fact, this cycle has already happened twice in the region of space we currently occupy. So the Sun and all of the planets are formed from the remnants of a previous solar system which was in turn formed by the remnants of another solar system. So our sun kinda has a grandparent.",

So every other element that exists was created in the cores of stars and during supernovae. A first generation star would have nothing in it besides hydrogen and helium. But when that star dies and sheds it's stellar material, the star that is born from that material includes all of the other elements that were made from the first star. The second star then repeats the process. We can measure the amount of stuff in our sun that isn't hydrogen or helium through emission spectroscopy (measuring what specific wavelengths of light are produced at specific amplitudes). Based on this and observations made in other stars, astronomers have determined that our sun is a third generation star. \n\nThe reason why we know it happened in the space we're in now (sort of, since the sun is orbiting the center of the galaxy and the galaxy itself is moving through space), is because the distance between stars is immensely vast. There just isn't enough material in empty space to form stars, and the material that is ejected from the death of a star doesn't really go very far is astronomical terms. So regions of space that have enough matter to form stars once tend to be able to produce stars through multiple generations.",

So when the sun fuses helium, that little bit of mass leftover is released as pure energy. This is what creates the heat and light from the sun.  This outward force of energy from fusion pushes against the force of gravity that is trying to crush the star. So the two forces balance out and the star is stable.\n\nHowever, fusing iron requires energy, it does not give off energy. So now there is nothing pushing against gravity and the star collapses in a fraction of a second, causing a supernova.\n\nOur star is not big enough to make iron and will not explode.",

Our sun is a low mass star and won't be generating any iron. \n\nInterestingly enough, most stars are low mass producing a large core of carbon under high temperature and pressure. Much of the stars outer layers get blown off as the star dies leaving only the dense carbon core. You know what we call dense carbon formed under high temperature and pressure? That's right, the universe is littered with earth sized diamonds just floating around in space.  \n\nBut to be more correct. Low mass stars have a life span of > 10 billion years, and their probably weren't any low mass stars in the first few generations of stars. So at ths moment, there are few low mass stars that have actually reached the end of their life cycle yet.",

When you combine them into a helium atom the mass of that new atom is not 2 units, instead it might be 1.75, and the other .25 units of mass gets converted into energy. \n\nWhen two helium atoms - each with 1.75 units of mass - combine into carbon they again turn some mass into energy, but this time it is a little less. The carbon atom may end up at 3.3 units mass, with 0.2 being converted to energy. \n\nWith each step the energy you get out of the conversion drops. Once you get to iron it takes more energy to fuse two atoms together than the process produces. Without that constant release of energy pushing outwards the star's gravity starts winning and the star begins to collapse and die.",

So, once a star starts to produce iron, it quickly collapses inward.  For large enough stars this will cause a supernova and leave behind a black hole.  For slightly smaller ones there will be a supernova, but there will not be enough mass to cause a black hole to form, so they will form a kind of star that is incredibly dense, but not as dense as a black hole.  The Sun is small enough that I think it won't actually create a full-on supernova, but a lot of the material in it will collapse in to create a white dwarf and the outer layers will disperse.\n\nThis sounds cool, as without a supernova it would seem like maybe the Earth could somehow survive...except the process before the collapse will result in it expanding to a red giant that will engulf all of the inner planets.",

And high mass being about 8 times that of our sun. \n\nOur sun would be a low mass star (less than four times that of our sun). \nSo it'll fuse Hydrogen to Helium, become a red giant, start fusing helium to Carbon and Oxygen. \nBut it'll never get hot enough to fuse Carbon! \n\nHelium burning in a shell around the core of carbon-oxygen is pretty unstable and disrupts the outer layers of the star shedding it out in a planetary nebula! \n\nAfter that it's just a dense carbon-oxygen core by itself, which is our White Dwarf. \n\nFun fact about White Dwarves! They don't produce heat, they just radiate heat that's stored in them like a brick heater. The universe isn't old for there to be any White Dwarves finished putting out heat! (Black Dwarves)",

The intense gravitational force our massive sun generates is such that atoms can speed up and crash into each resulting in nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusi\u00f3n is when 2 light nuclei merge together to form a single heavy nucleus. Our sun does this with hydrogen which fuse to become helium. The mass of the helium nucleus is less than the combined mass of the two hydrogen nuclei, and the remaining mass is converted into energy. The famous E=Mc2 describes this process. \n\nThis happens over and over again resulting in a ridiculous amount of energy. That energy heats up the gas inside stars, ripping apart electrons from atoms forming ionized gas. We call this super heated gas plasma. \n\nThe fire in your fire place is not plasma. It is too cool to result in a significant amount of ionization. That fire is what happens when a mixture of fuel and oxygen reaches a high enough temperature to sustain rapid oxidation resulting in a chain reaction. In other words, fire hot, plasma hotter.",

Firstly, oxygen doesn't burn itself, burning is other chemicals being oxidised (usually). So carbon burns and becomes carbon dioxide, carbon with 2 oxygens attached.\n\nHowever, the sun is SO hot, there are no molecules (usually again, sorry), everything is in an ionised atomic state, where even the atoms themselves have had some of their electrons removed to become ions.\n\nSo inside a plama you can't really have \"burning\" as we would know it, because what small amount of oxygen there is (the sun is almost all hydrogen and helium) doesn't connect and bond to anything else as it's just too hot, there's too much energy.\n\nHowever, as things start to cool down upon leaving the star, the most common molecule to form is water, H2O, which is essentially left over unfused hydrogen burning as it cools.\n\nSo I guess it's the reverse of the pirates meme \"No, but actually yes\" actually!",

Burning is ALWAYS chemicals being oxidised, it's just that \"being oxidised\" doesn't actually require oxygen itself. Somewhat confusingly oxidation is a *type* of chemical reaction that just most commonly happens with oxygen but doesn't require it.\n\nEDIT: Also, by \"most common molecule\", I actually meant \"most common multi-element molecule\".",

Basically flame is plasma.\nSun undergoing the nuclear reaction, turns its material into plasma. So in some sense, sun is a ball of flames. But there is no burning there.\nAnd to wrap it - oxygen cannot burn anything on the sun, because everything is already plasma and conditions are way to extreme for normal oxidation to occur. However, when you light up your fireplace with a lighter - you are using a bit of plasma to trigger oxygen in the air to start bonding with the combustible material - burning. So in your words you use plasma to light something on fire.",

                      "text": "You can't \"light oxygen on fire\" and plasma is a state not matter.\n\nLike, fire is what we call the rapid reaction of a material with oxygen. So a hydrocarbon for example can catch on fire, reacting with oxygen, releasing water and carbon dioxide and sometimes some byproducts, and providing enough energy to catalyze the reaction between other molecules of the hydrocarbon and the oxygen. \n\nWhen we see a flame, that's highly energetic particles of gasses and particles that are so hot that they emit black body radiation and particular wavelength light from electrons dropping to lower energy states in excited molecules. \n\nSo if you had something burning incompletely, it's going to be more opaque because stuff like particles of unburned carbon will be floating around in the air glowing so hot that they turn red or orange or even white, and then they cool off and turn black and turn into smoke or soot.  If you have a complete reaction you still might get a glow as the products of the reactions release energy as they cool down at specific wavelengths. \n\nSo you can't \"light oxygen on fire\" because what are you lighting? What does it mean to \"light\".  Pure oxygen is stable, at least until you get to pressures where it's going to start undergoing fusion. Fire is funny because it's not a thing. Oxygen isn't fire, oxidation isn't fire, fuel isn't fire, glowing soot isn't fire.  Fire is a specific situation where you have oxygen, you have something to oxidize, and the combustion reaction is powerful enough to start a chain reaction and chemically will create a visible flame. \n\nIn the same way, saying \"plasma\" is like saying \"liquid\" or \"gas\".  There's other elements that are plasma. Plasma is like a gas, but where a gas has molecules with the electrons nearby, plasma is what you get when for some reason the electrons are not nearby.  In the case of stars, this is kind of because the energy released in the process of fusion is so high that it kind of makes those electrons too hot to stick around in a stable way.  When the ions and the electrons do catch up with each other, it cools it off a bit, and they release some energy at a specific wavelength.  This description doesn't do it justice.\n\nIf you had an element in a plasma state in the sun that was reactive with oxygen, it's not really going to make fire.  This is because the reaction needs to release heat, which means that the stuff reacting needs to be in a stable state such that there is energy stored up in the bonds.  So for example, molecular oxygen, O2 has energy stored in its bond. It needed energy to get that way.  It needs some energy to break it apart, but then when it reforms with, say, carbon, it doesn't use up as much of that energy and it's just released as light or heat. \n\nBut at the temperatures you're looking at, Oxygen is ionized plasma. It's already broken apart, and there's already too much energy to let it want to go and bond with Carbon and settle down and have a little CO2 family. The only thing that keeps all of this together really is gravity, and the gravity is so strong that it keeps pulling these things in and smushing them together way closer than their electromagnetic force would normally let them get, until they stop having the power to be independent, give into the allure of the strong force, start being a fusion product, and release the power of their lost independence into the rest of the sphere, keeping that plasma piping hot and keeping any more complex molecules from getting any clever ideas of forming in such a way. \n\nWhat you see from a star is a bit of both of the sources of light you see in a flame, you have the black body radiation from the temperature, and you have specific wavelengths of light emitted electrically.  But it's not fire, like light from an LED is not fire, or an incandescent light bulb is not fire. Like excited gas's electrons jumping around is not fire, or glowing particles of soot is not fire.",

The metal isn't on fire, the atoms are just so hot they glow. I guess it's actually more similar to old-school neon lights. There isn't fire, just electrons jumping around their different energy levels: they absorb energy in some form, jump up to a higher energy level, then they jump back down and emit the excess energy as light waves.\n\nAs a side note, the sun probably contains little to no oxygen. When stars begin making elements heavier than helium, it's a sign that the star might be running out of hydrogen to use for fuel in its core. That can mean the star is going to \"die\" so i really hope our sun isn't making a lot of oxygen.",

This core is many tens of times the density of steel to give you an idea. It gets this dense because it is being crushed under the gravity of the entire sun, this along with the high temperatures force the nuclei of atoms together unto fusion. Different nuclei (isotopes) produce different fusion products, but many directly produce photons. These photons bounce around inside the sun on a rough trajectory radially outwards getting absorbed and re emitted until the eventually reach the upper layers that are mostly transparent to light. The 'fireball' ness of the sun is a direct result of plasma phenomena. The upper layers & surface where this is observed also emits some of the light we see. Loosely speaking, Plasma is a gas where thermal energies are high enough to decouple electrons from nuclei. These charged particles interact with the magnetic field forming the complex sometimes flame like structures observed on the surface. When electrons recombine with nuclei, they emit photons, some of which we see. \n\nSource: senior physics undergrad, did research in fusion plasmas and stellar plasmas",

Otherwise the material would just continue to get hot(assuming an outside source of heat.) but there would be no flame. Look up auto ignition of oil on YouTube. A fireman demonstrated. At a certain point oil gets hot enough to ignite without a source of fire to get it started and the fumes just start reacting with oxygen. Once the oxygen is taken away the flames go away but it\u2019s still hot enough to support flames. \n\nThe sun doesn\u2019t have fuel to burn. So there would be nothing for the oxygen to react with. The energy released in the sun is due to nuclear fusion and not burning. It\u2019s confusing because we talk about the sun as if it\u2019s burning, even a scientist might refer to it as that out of convenience but that makes it confusing or people who don\u2019t have specific knowledge.",

On the other hand, a higher-temperature flame does indeed contain enough freed electrons and ions to act as a plasma. ... A candle flame is therefore not a plasma.\n\nSo technically I'm right, it's just has different characteristics because of its temperature.",

Here is the mass, here is the typical energy of such a reaction, here's the luminosity of the sun (incidentally, all of these numbers were known by the mid-19th century). Then do the math on how long it would burn.  \n\nYou can then do this with a first-order approximation of nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium assuming 10% of the sun's total mass undergoes fusion.  \n\nI don't have the numbers with me now, but it's a pretty huge difference. Turns out fusion reactions are amazingly efficient sources of energy! And this is one of the foundational results of modern astrophysics, so, you know, not unimportant.",

That being said I'm pretty confident that it's correct.\n\nThe great lord Kelvin, literally a victorian scientific superstar, continually lowered his estimates for the age of the sun (and thus the earth and solar system) over and over again. \n\nHe started with an estimate of 100 million years and kept lowering it to eventually 20 million. He wasn't being willful or anything, there simply wasn't anything in physics at the time which could explain how a burning ball of anything could avoid extinguishing for more than a few million years at most.\n\nSo while I am not sure that there were large contingents of folks convinced that the sun would burn out soon, I am quite confident there were issues with fossils and the age of the earth which simply could not be rectified if the sun was burning matter chemical reaction style.\n\nEdit: I see this is getting a few upvotes, and while no one asked, I thought it would be a good idea to include the name of the book that I referenced. I read it a couple of times as I thought the information was so worth memorizing, and also the audiobook as read by the author was delightful.\n\nA Short History of Nearly Everything by Bill Bryson",

                      "text": "Bryson told a good story, as always. But he neglected the larger story IIRC. So Kelvin predicted the age of the earth on thermodynamics assuming the earth had started as a molten ball and cooled to a solid. Bryson tells it that Rutherford poked the big hole in Kelvin's model by proving there was also radiogenic heating, someting Kelvin didn't account for. Radiation was a pretty new idea at the time.\n\nRutherford wasn't wrong about radiogenic heating, but it also was no where near enough energy to explain why Kelvin was so very wrong. There were others at the time who were proposing the main reason. A liquid mantle resulting in convective heating and plate tectonics. The eart wasn't solid im fact. But they were mostly geologists and that was a very new science at the time which was not well accepted. Also, they didn't have great evidence. They did have some.\n\nThe story over the incredibly long battle between geologsts and physcists, and more specifically the battle over plate tectonics and continental drift is fascinating. Bryson gets into a bit I think. Da Vinci proposed mountains rise from the ocean. But it wasn't until 1915 that Wegner started making serious arguments. And then it wasn't until the 50s and 60s that serious evidence began to be gathered. It was in the 70s that a consensus began to be reached in the general scientific community. I'm 43 and when I first learned about it in 6th grade earth science, it was still referred to as a \"new\" theory. Of course the schools are always at least behind.",

So, Kelvin (from the temperature scale, and a bunch of other things) tried to explain it with gravitational contraction, which also provides a source of energy, but that comes out to no more than 10 Myr; he did advocate for a geologically young earth, but it was hard to make that work even at the time. However, it was clear the sun was not about to burn out any time soon, and I don't think that was ever a concern.  \n\nEddington correctly hypothesized in the 1920s that nuclear fusion would be just the energy source needed - that was before it had been discovered experimentally! - and he turned out to be right, of course. I would say it's the turning point in that debate.",

Under *extreme* (and I do mean extreme) conditions, which you can find in the core of a star, it's possible to mash these things together. Then you form a new nucleus, i.e., a new kind of atom. The trick is that, for any atom less massive than iron, the nucleus that is formed then is just a tiny little bit less massive than the masses of the nuclei that made it. Where does the difference go? The answer is that it is turned into energy. Einstein tell us that E = mc\u00b2, or to put it in words, the energy that is generated is equal to (a tiny little bit of mass) times (the speed of light times the speed of light). And the speed of light is such a big number that even a small bit of mass becomes a lot of energy; so this is a really good way of powering a star.",

It is hypergolic with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water-with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals-steel, copper, aluminium, etc.-because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride which protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminium keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.",

The other half, reduction, is the taking of those electrons.\n\n For example, in the burning of propane, propane (C3H8) is oxidiced to CO2 while O2 is reduced to H2O. On the other hand, if you pour clorhidric acid (HCl) on iron, it will be oxidiced to FeCl and HCl reduced to H2. Both reactions have the same nature.",

Plasma is a state of matter, like a solid or gas, but when talking about gas filling a room you would probably want to refer to what the gas is made of (Oxygen, Nitrogen, etc). Similarly, the composition of the sun has elements like Hydrogen, Helium, Carbon, and Nitrogen, and these elements are in a state of plasma. So yes, the sun is \"made\" of plasma, but the plasma is a variety of different elements that in essence fuel the Sun's nucleosynthesis.",

Analyzing your own thought processes and patterns. It is key to challenging your understanding of things.\n\nThey hear information and, if it looks authentic enough for them, as in having an acceptable amount of big words in the article or mathematics visuals that are at least as complex as algebra, and they come to the conclusion that the information is defacto. Especially if it aligns with basic \"common sense\" understanding of science. \n\nAnd that's where we reach the issue. Science is profoundly unintuitive. Every single \"law\" of science has a point where it eventually stops working. Inevitably, when you get too big or too small, something like basic chemistry can no longer be applied. A great example of this are \"Virtual Particles\" which unlike \"real particles\"  seemingly generate spontaneously inside of a vacuum and then can disappear just as quickly. Quantum Mechanical Theory as a whole is the explaination for things like this, but unless you dedicate a significant portion of time to study, QMT makes exactly no goddamn sense.\n\nAnd when something makes no sense, the fastest response is to call bullshit on it.\n\nAnd this is where Dunning-Kruger comes in to play. These people, who have no investment in science hear things from people who have dedicated their lives to science and can't make heads or tails of the information presented. So they call bullshit. After all, if the things they said were true, it would be easy to understand how it works. So then someone else like the layman comes along and says something along the lines of 'When you take X in to account, Y can't be true, therefore the answer obviously is R.' This makes sense to our non-scientist and they can intuitively understand the concept, therefore that has to be right.\n\nAnd because they lack the critical thinking necessary to have a meta-analysis on why they agree with one person and not the other, they aren't aware of the mistakes being made.\n\nI mean, hell. Just go and try to understand the Strange Matter Hypothesis and somehow make sense of a matter type that is contagious to other Matter and would, potentially infect non-strange Matter and assimilate it all.\n\nSomething like that to people like us in on the same scale as understanding that the oversimplifications of 5th grade science aren't necessarily even accurate in the face of actual science.",

All you can do is guess the area where it's most likely to be hanging out, like tracing an invisible man's steps in the snow, and that's how you draw the orbital.\n\nTo note: most of the possible electron orbitals don't look like circles either, you can google some images.",

Particle physics fails the eye-test (and starts giving nonsense explanations) at the subatomic level because they try to claim the electron is a whole object when it probably isn't.  There's no way to test the mass of something in chunks smaller than the electron because that's the amount of energy that is attracted to the singular proton.\n\nImagine you have measuring cups and you're asked to fill up a pool but that pool is just made up of more measuring cups.  So you fit as many measuring cups full of water into the pool as you can.  All the measurements say 1 measuring cup of water can exist at a time, so clearly the water comes in solid units of 1 measuring cup worth, right?  Because the pool is only made of a pile of measuring cups, you'll never be able to prove the cups are holding a liquid and not a ball conveniently sized for your cup.  In particle physics, there's no way to 'see' anything but units of energy that align with the nuclei of the atoms.\n\nYou can see how they took a massive leap of logic to preserve particle physics.  Some argue they are just trying to promote 'intelligent design' because \"isn't it magical how 1 proton equals 1 electron in energy?  The universe is designed!\" is an argument that they get to make.\n\nSo in other words, churches likely impeding science.\n\nExamine the split plate experiment.  They'll exclaim \"The electron acts like it is in two places at a time!  Quantum physics!  Jesus magic!\" but not even entertain the idea that the electrons are made up of far, far far smaller parts that add up in quantities that oppose the rigidly structured proton-filled nuclei of the known universe.",

                  "text": "\\*Cracks knuckles\\* OK here we go... nuclear fusion in as much of a nutshell as I can make it:\n\nEverything around us, literally everything was made inside of a star.  The most simplest element, hydrogen, contains a single proton and a single electron (in it's base form, but let's not worry about the concept of isotopes for now).  The second most simplest element is helium.  It contains two protons, two neutrons and two electrons.  For the purposes of this discussion, neutrons are kinda useless.  Don't worry about them.  Anyway, to be able to make helium, you need to be able to squeeze two hydrogen atoms together \\*REALLY HARD\\*.  You see, protons, being both positively charged, don't want to get near each other.  They repel.  This is very similar to how two magnets repel each other, only on an extreme scale.  However, kinda like how you can overcome the force of two same-pole magnets and still shove them together with your hands, with enough force you can shove two protons together and force them to stick.  When you do this, a large amount of energy is released.\n\nNow... The sun, and all stars, are really just giant balls of elements, mostly hydrogen plasma.  A plasma is simply ionized gas, which means the electrons and the protons got knocked off of each other and are somewhat free flowing.  (Flames like in a fire are nothing more than a plasma, for what it's worth) This plasma comes together due to gravity, and it takes a very long time for it to all come together.  It's kinda like how water gathers from being on land, into rivers, then into oceans.  Stars are kinda like how oceans are, but for hydrogen instead of water.  When a random ball of gas gets big enough, it has enough gravity in the middle to start squeezing that hydrogen really hard.  You ever swim deep underwater like in a pool?  Feel that pressure on your ears?  Well, that happens to hydrogen.  When you get enough of that pressure, it finally overcomes the repulsive force of the protons and they fuse.  This is nuclear fusion.  It releases a LOT of energy.  It's a huge explosion.  But... since the star is so \"heavy\", the gravity keeps that explosion kinda in check.  It can't get too big because the gravity pulls it back down.  So a star is basically just constantly undergoing a giant thermonuclear explosion, but it's keeping itself in check due to how heavy it is.  As this happens some of that helium fuses with more hydrogen to make lithium (the third most complicated element).  Look on a periodic table and you can see these listed out.  As a star gets older and older, more and more of those elements get \"squeezed\" into existence.  \n\nEventually a star will run out of hydrogen to fuse.  That's when interesting things start to happen.  Heavier and heavier elements (like Iron, Copper, etc) are made, and eventually that star explodes and scatters those heavy elements all over the place.  When that happens, the pressure of the fusion explosion pushing outward and the pressure of gravity pulling inward gets out of balance.  It would be a bit of a much more long-winded comment to explain the various ways stars \"die\", but suffice it to say they either fizzle out if they are small, like our sun, and turn into white dwarves which are really just a shell of ionized elements, or if they are large they explode into a supernova.  Sometimes those heavy elements that get shot out form together much like the original \"ocean of hydrogen\" and forms things like planets, and more stars.  \n\nIf a star is big enough, however, something even weirder happens.  Its gravity can be SO strong that it collapses farther in on itself until it is so dense and heavy that it forms black hole.  At this point nothing, not even light, can get away from this star remnant.  \n\nThis was the best I could do with easy to understand language, and in as much of a nutshell as a reddit comment can be... again, I can explain more.  Ask questions if you want!\n\n(Note I am not an astrophysicist... but I am an aerospace/orbital engineer, and have been designing satellite systems for 20+years)",

          "text": "Stars are formed from large clouds of gas and dust that slowly condense over time and eventually collapse. As they collapse the density within the proto-star increases until nuclear fusion begins. At that point the newly formed star grows very hot and expands against against gravity. If there's too much mass already in the start it explodes into a supernova. If there's even more mass it might collapse into a black hole. However, most stars reach what's called hydrostatic equilibrium which is the balance between gravity trying to collapse the star and internal pressure from heat trying to cause the start to explode.\n\nSo, they're just big fusion reactors. Generally, they're fusing hydrogen into helium. Once the hydrogen is sufficiently depleted the equilibrium is upset and a further collapse can happen, triggering the next evolution of the star (e.g., nova, supernova, red/white dwarf.)",

As long as there is enough energy to heat the matter, it doesn't matter that there isn't a fuel to burn. The gravity of the sun compresses hydrogen atoms together, fusing into helium and releasing energy. That energy superheats the matter in the sun to where it glows, turning it into plasma, and thus looking like fire.",

This is the pedal to the metal, tires screeching, exciting acceleration needed to get to space. It may be a smaller part of the fuel, but it is 85% of the propellant used to leave the  atmosphere.\n\nI'm a rocket nerd. I had to look up what was in the booster again, but when I read this I had to say something. If you're thinking of the  astronauts the vehicle they were in only had H-O fuel, but their shuttle was strapped to a big red and white booster rocket. You are 100% accurate that people didn't get to space by using oxygen as the oxidizer.\n\nThough to give the other guy credit. The fuel you use once you are in space is usually half liquid oxygen - space fuel\n\nWe just burn aluminum cans with prechloric acid to get us to space.",
