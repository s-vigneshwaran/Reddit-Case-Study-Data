Unless you recorded it, it's very hard to prove. So putting up a rule that gives people the rape sentence for false accusations is dangerous. You won't just be preventing false accusations, you'll be preventing all accusations.  Seeing as to how hard it is to prove rape, no real victim would even attempt accusing someone anymore, because there is a high likelihood that they'll fail and then end up in jail as well... Ofcrouse if you can prove without reasonable doubt that she was lying, that's a different story. But i'm not in favor of giving sentences to women that just lose these cases. Many actual victims don't get justice because of how hard it is to prove, I don't want them to be thrown in jail on top of the trauma. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut there also needs to be put a stop to all the false allegations...",
