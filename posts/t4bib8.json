  "text": "TIFU when I tried to wake my husband up by licking his balls\nSo I was feeling playful and I thought a fun thing to do would be to wake him up with a bit of a stroke and a kiss down there. He lays on his side so the easiest thing to do was to give him a gentle stroke. He started stiffening but didn't really stir. He loves me licking his balls so I tried to give them a lick.\n\nIt wasn't easy without him helping to manoeuvre into the right position. I lifted his leg a bit and got a good angle. He started to stir and shift. So I sat back until he settled more on his front but still on his side. \n\nI was clearly in quite a determined mood and I tried to get to his balls from behind through his raised leg. \n\nAs I was trying to get in there again he let out a massive fart. Just instantly stinky, inches from my nose. I saw it before I felt it and I felt it before I smelt it but there was nothing I could do to save myself. So gross. Wouldn't recommend! He's not even that windy. It was bad luck.\n\nOf course he woke up hard and wanted to get going. Reader, there was no way for him to get me back in the mood that morning.\n\nTL;DR I tried to wake my husband up by licking his balls, but he farted I'm my face.",

In my mind I was thinking \"hehe butt\" until suddenly she let out this flubbering trombone of a fart and I could feel the breeze go between my fingers as her butt cheeks jiggled with it. She's a super petite girl so the gail force wind and the sound that came from her was super unexpected. I burst into laughter and it woke her up to a very \"unfresh\" smelling room. She assumed my laughter and the smell was because *I* farted so she yelled at me to go use the bathroom haha. I wish I had a picture of her face after I explained what happened. In our 8yrs together that is the only time she's ever farted around me. I think she's emotionally scarred from it haha.",

Many, MANY couples are okay with this because they're good, healthy couples who have talked about it.\n\nBut this is Reddit, where there are hordes of dudes chomping at the bit for a good \"reverse the genders ... gotcha!\"",

If he so chose, and had evidence, he could press criminal charges against his wife in most states. Even if you were to verbally agree while conscious, you are unable to legally consent when you fall asleep. \n\nNow morally it should be whatever the both of them are fine with, laws surrounding rape and sexual assault tend to have a \"better safe than sorry\" mentality and can sometime envelope situations that both people actively want to participate in.\n\nSo if you and your SO want to practice this, just be aware of how your state views it.",

Here\u2019s the thing though, the vast majority of us are not having to deal with anything remotely similar to your circumstances. Hopefully in the future you pick your partners with a bit more care. Obviously I\u2019m basing my interpretation on this comment of yours:\n\n>Unfortunetly this is a decision that is not a choice for some people. I myself although i love my daughter with all of my heart and having her is the greatest thing that ever happened to me, did not have the choice in if she was born or not.\n\n>I got black out drunk at a party an ex of mine was at and found out at a later date that she had gotten pregnant at that party.  After several heated requests I realized that I had no choice in if I had a child or not.\n\n>This led down a path of thousands of lawyer and court fees over 6 years and what will end up being 21 years in child support.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/88kuhn/_/dwlcn2z/?context=1\n\nEdit: And wow lol. Here\u2019s another piece of sage advice from yourself. Apparently women are responsible for being sexually assaulted due to the clothing they choose to wear. Real fucking cool of you, scumbag. \n\n>Very true. It should be a cautionary tale. If you put yourself in a dangerous situation, like going to a bar in a short skirt or walking around late at night in a dangerous area there are people who will take advantage of you.  There are bad people out there. You have to be cautious.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/88kuhn/_/dwlya9j/?context=1\n\nEdit 2: Holy shit your comment history is a disgusting train wreck lmao. I can\u2019t stop looking through it. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/5lzx2q/_/dbzo8v9/?context=1\n\n>Women very rarely know how to do anything anymore. When I see a women actually do anything of value, cook a meal, operate a vacuum properly, it really turns me on!",

And also, I'm not even mad, I'm sharing the legal and moral perspective that really needs to be out there. A lot of people seem to think that marriage = consent and that's just not the case. Marital rape is a thing, sexual assault in marriage is a thing, I don't know that that's what happened here, because this couple may have had an arrangement ahead of time.\n\nBut, if sexual contact while one or the other in a couple is asleep hasn't been OK'd by both people, it's sexual assault.",

OP has even stayed in other comments that both parties have given this sort of activity the go-ahead.\n\n2) statistically speaking, directing this comment at a woman is sort of silly. I\u2019m not saying that women never commit spousal rape, just that you taking the time to make this comment on a TIFU from a woman is *really* missing the mark on who is the culprit in the **overwhelming majority** of spousal rape cases. \n\nOf course, there\u2019s something to be said there about how *accurate* the reporting is in either case. Far fewer male victims of domestic abuse even go as far as reporting their abuse than women, so I could be off base here. However, assuming the data we have available to be *reasonably* untainted by irregularities like this, why on earth aren\u2019t you focusing more on things men post? That is to say, why would you even dilute the reach of your message by pointing it towards the demographic **least likely** to commit spousal rape?",
