The only things he did were poop when we put him in his kitty litter box and eat when we put food or water in front of him. We hoped that after a week that he would show signs of improvement. We put him down as there was no change. He had no signs of injury, I think he ate rat poison or something. Fun times.\n\nWe got two more cats, let them go outdoors regularly\u2026 they would go missing for a day or two but eventually they just never returned. Our neighbour told us when we asked that he\u2019d seen a cat being carried into the woods by a fox months before. We got another cat and did our best to keep him inside. Once in a while he escapes, he would hide beside the door and make his escape if you didnt guard the exit bravely. Well he went missing for 3 days once, came back with cuts, ticks and splinters. Got him all fixed up and since then he has kept guard by the door but no longer attempts to escape.",

I just didn't feel like I had enough space for 4 cats. We're fortunate to live somewhere with a really good shelter and I felt they would be much better equipped to find them a home than I am. A week later we were sad, our cats missed the kittens and were sad, and we were sad that our cats were sad. Turned around back to the shelter and adopted them. Overall it cost us to drop them off AND pick them up but it was totally worth it. I'm glad they didn't have that policy of no adoptions after surrendering! But I can see how that would be a good way to weed out some irresponsible pet owners. \n \n(4 cats is still a little crowded but they all get along really well so it's ok)",

I was fortunate to have it to give at the time and I felt responsible for them. \n \nPricing people out of vet care is terrible,  though everything is more expensive right now. The issue around here is vet care is a little high but affordable, but you can't get it. There aren't enough vets. Everyone got pets during Covid or something, now if you want to go to a new vet there's a three month wait list, at least. And there was a 6 to 10 week wait to schedule them to be spayed (including at the humane society). So dropping them at the shelter did get me something money couldn't buy, because they had them fixed that week. \n\nAs far as costs at shelters go, some are supported financially by their local government (ours is)  and some are not, or not well supported. So that will make the costs vary a lot. How subsidized is your fee. And they also do low cost vet care (or did back when you could schedule an appointment). I assume that's not an option where you are.",

I did 25 pushups and my muscles were shaking (again fat and out of shape) so I took a break. 25 minutes later they were still shaking.

They had a sign that said she got along with other dogs. I asked if I could bring my dog up to see if they were compatible. They said no. It would be fine and I could bring the dog back if there was a problem. \n\nThe dog immediately attacked my other dog when I brought it home. I called my vet and got a list of things to try from a behavioralist/dog trainer they had on staff and tried to train her. Then a few days later, the adopted dog attacked my other dog when he was literally just sleeping on the couch. I had to pay an expensive vet bill for stitches because she had ripped his ear in two. \n\nThe behavioralist took the adopted dog for an evaluation and said she didn't think the dog could ever be safely around other dogs. She could try to train it but it would be better in a house without other pets. The thing was the dog was sweet and well behaved - except with other dogs. So I took it back to the Humane Society because they had said when I adopted her I could. In fact, their contract said I had to surrender her to them if I decided I didn't want her. \n\nThe woman at the Humane Society started screaming me when I explained why I was surrendering the dog. She was so loud my husband who was outside trying to find a parking space said he could hear her. The shelter lady yelled that if I brought the dog back and told them the dog attacks other dogs they would have to put her down. Then she started screaming while loudly sobbing that I was a dog murderer and was I happy that this dog was going to die. It was so unhinged and weird. I picked the dog up and left while she was still screaming at me. I didn't even explain what I was going to do. I just left. I found another home for her where she was happy as an only pet. The sad thing is it's been close to 30 years but I'm not sure I'll trust a shelter after that because I think they lied about the dog being okay with other dogs.",

I would hope the outdoor cat excuse wouldn\u2019t hold much water when the animals they\u2019ve gone out of their way to adopt are begging for shelter in below freezing temperatures and being denied.\n\nThe level of cruelty some people inflict on their animals blows my mind. I lived in Antigua for a while and there was this house with two big shepherds kept outside on 10-12 foot chains 24/7 no matter how hot or how bad the weather was. Eventually some Good Samaritans trespassed, cut the chains, and brought them to a shelter the night before we were hit by a category 5 hurricane.\n\nEdit: typo",

It is literally animal control's job to trap neuter and release feral cats, but if there is genuine abuse going on they will find that too. \n\nHandy tip for getting results from your local agencies, always follow up a call with an email in writing. Follow up in the email thread to summarize what they say when they call you back. If they don't respond at all, follow up regarding that and CC the email address for someone else in the city. The mayor's office usually works - that person has to run for re-election.",

Until then, the chickens sleep in the garage. Took only a few days  to get into the routine and now they line up at the back door and parade nicely through the house at bedtime to get there. \n\nI have never had a predator kill three birds in one night. I\u2019ve had cats attack chickens and badly maul them (scalped one) to where they needed wound care for weeks, I\u2019ve had owls snatch a single hen, I\u2019ve had coyotes grab a chicken and drop it after being yelled at (two separate events).

If I observe a cat not **craving** freedom, you can explain why in numerous ways, such as the act being an internal, invisible process, or individual cats having unique personalities.\n\nSo the burden of proof falls on you, the one who believes a positive statement, not me, the skeptic.",

The fact that they aren\u2019t the biggest threat doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nWhat does matter is that they are a non-negligible part of the problem, *and something every individual cat owner can contribute too*. The average person has an extremely limited ability to *personally* mitigate environmental damage, but this is something that anyone can do, will cost them nothing, and will in fact improve their own life (no more danger of death/disease/injury to their pet) by doing. \n\nI absolutely do consider this a hill worth dying on because we\u2019re never gonna solve the problem of cat depredation from the back end (nobody really cares about feral cats until you start trying to remove them and then it\u2019s *think of the kittens*; it\u2019s like a small scale, environmental version of what abortion is to American politics).",

Many of the coastal beaches traditionally used by piping plovers for nesting have been lost to commercial, residential, and recreational developments. Through the use of dams or other water control structures, humans are able to raise and lower the water levels of many lakes and rivers of plover inland nest sites. Too much water in the spring floods the plovers' nests. Too little water over a long period of time allows grasses and other vegetation to grow on the prime nesting beaches, making these sites unsuitable for successful nesting.\n\n\nEdit - https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/pipingplover/pipingpl.html",

And then of course there is the havoc cats cause to wildlife, especially birds.\n\n\nAmericans recently relocated to NZ with our 2 indoor cats. When we were looking for apartments, the agents talked to all seemed convinced we wanted easy indoor-outdoor life so cats have easy access. Nope! I want a fortress with no escape paths, is what I want. It's culturally accepted here that most domestic cats are outdoor, which is madness, since this is a country that is for and all about their birds. You can't claim to love your native bird species (many of which don't have good defence from land predators), and also let your cat go outside.",

Please dont take this as an attack on you, generally it is much better for cats to stay indoors. Domestic cats have contributed significantly to the extinction of several native species, and are still a huge threat to others. Plus, there's always the risk of them being hit by a car or getting into a fight with some other animal. Even if they get along well with other cats, they can catch diseases like FIV and FeLV. I lost my first kitty to FeLV, which she caught on the streets before I adopted her. I dont wish that on anyone. She had a collar on but it was far too loose, and she had gotten her foot stuck in it. No tags, no chip, no responsibility.\n\nThere is plenty of enrichment you can provide a cat without letting them outside. Catnip, self-play toys, battery powered toys, wands, hide and seek treats, etc. They can sun in windows just fine. The shelters in my area require you to sign an agreement that your cat will be indoor only before you adopt. I dont know how indoor only or leashing a cat is any more to put on an owner than trying to train them to stick to a specific property -- despite all the tips and tricks I can find, I've never quite been able to train a cat successfully. Perhaps that's a personal failing, or their personality, but it's much easier to me just keeping them indoors",

The cats just hop it and take off to go be cats.  \n\nI mean, I get the arguments agains letting your cat out unsupervised now. But it was never a concern I heard expressed before about 10 years ago. Growing up it just seemed completely normal to let your cat out.",

You can't coddle them from any prospective threat. It's like being a helicopter parent, bit for cats.\n\nDogs still get hit by cars on walks, and cars aren't really that much of danger of road accident, with just over 1,000 being reported from 2012 to 2014. Of course these accidents are awful and responsible owners should take steps to avoid this, like keeping them inside on the mornings and giving them a high vis collar, but again, you can't coddle your animals against any possible risk. That would be like saying taking a dog out for a walk is irresponsible since dogs also get hit by cars.\n\nCats have collars to avoid being stolen. If the family decides not to give them back that's an issue with them\n\nIt wouldn't get shot, because the exists a world outside of the USA. And again, that's an issue either a psychopath neighbour, not the owner.\n\nThat's why you flea and worm your pets regularly. And again, this will happen to dogs if you take them for walks.\n\nYes I do let me dog out to do as she pleases, it's called walking her. She can also go out into the back garden whenever she wants, just like my cat.\n\nYou could make the argument that dogs don't need to be walked so long as you play with them and exercise them inside, but most people would consider that cruel. And especially after this pandemic where many many many people have become depressed from staying inside for long periods of time.\n\nActually go fuck yourself. You people are always so smug and holier-than-thou. It's really no surprise you've lost friends over this. If I knew you in real life I wouldn't not want to be your friend either.\n\nIf its about keeping them.\"safe\" why boy keep them in a cage or pet carrier their entire lives? They're not resistant to chewing through wires, or drowning in your bathtub or being smothered by you in bed. If you are soooooooooo irresponsible that you just let your cat wonder around your house then maybe you should just not own a cat????\n\nI am willing to provide all of those things. But belive it or not, cats still live to go outside. You said you rescue cats right? So I assume you've tried to keep and outdoor cat inside? I doubt you would actually admit to it since it wouldn't fit your narrative, but outdoor cats that are brought inside get depressed, put on weight, stop exercising etc. No matter how much time you spend with them, or enrichment you give them. I know this first hand as I've volunteered at a cat shelter for years. Keeping cats inside is cruel.\n\n\nIf you're not willing to let your animal do what it naturally does, then don't get that animal.\n\nYou want to keep you cat inside it's entire life? get a houseplant instead.",

The third, you can still let your cat outside: in a catio, on a harness and a lead that\u2019s staked into the back garden, or on walks if they\u2019re comfortable with that.

After about 4 months the male would try and escape any time you opened the door, usually you'd have your hands full Or he would just appear out of nowhere and jet out, then you would have to go chase him.

              "text": "I have no problem with outdoor cats, but only if that cat is very well trained. I'm talking only goes out for a few hours during the day, obviously only in a low traffic, no wild animal neighborhood, must come when it's called, but be fixed and have all shots, and must coexist with other creatures without killing and maiming. Obvious exemption to the killing clause would be a farm who keeps barn cats specifically for mousing (which keeps the other animals safe and healthy without the use of pesticides), but they need to be fixed and cared for as well.\n\nMy cat was fine with all this for a year after we got her, then realized that while she knew not to kill animals and would lie in the back yard while squirrels played around her, she hadn't tried her hand at live animals. After bringing us a bunny from a nest like it was her kitten (totally unharmed luckily, and I was able to find the nest and put it back, checked it out a few days later and all babies were healthy with bellies full of milk) we decided there was too much small wildlife in our area, and she would be indoor only from then on. Plus the local crows had grown fond of swooping down at her any time she went up on the roof. (She still gets an occasional romp in the snow when it's really deep, though. She likes to build tunnels.)\n\nI volunteered at a cat rescue for awhile and the way people treat cats, indoor or outdoor, is crazy. So often they get no toys, no vet checkups, no training, cheapest food possible, etc. Though most are more self sufficient than dogs, they still need a great deal of care. I hear so many stories about people who keep losing cats to cars, violent neighbors or animals, but just keep getting another cat and still let it out without training or consideration. Or people who say their cat never comes out from hiding in their house, doesn't like to be pet, doesn't like to play, etc. Like that is just a bored, neglected animal. Worse, is people who don't fix their cats and let them roam, or let their indoor cats keep making kittens. Every shelter and rescue is *so overwhelmed* with cats that need homes. Yes, your cat is very cute, but that's not a reason to breed it. Cat breeding should be considered animal cruelty, honestly. I don't care what kind of fancy breed you've got. \n\nReally sucks that people view them as so disposable.",

We had a cat who absolutely hated being inside because he was born on a farm and was let outside all the time as a kitten. He was legitimately depressed being inside 24/7. When they are never let outside they are perfectly happy being inside cats because it's all they know. At least that's my experience with owning cats. Again I do not like cats being outdoors but sometimes the cat will not be happy being indoors all the time(kind of ironic as he was afraid of everything(we think something had happened before.we got him but we are not sure) and yet he preferred being outside in the big open world).\n\nEdit: a word.",

Birds are preyed on in much bigger numbers in the first place. It's almost impossible to estimate exact numbers but natural predators, disease and other natural factors kill a lot more than cats do. 3. Cats tend to go for rodents rather than birds, so often the birds they do catch or sick or weak, meaning they were less Lilley to survive anyway.\n\n\nAlso in the US cats are a relatively recent introduction, in places like Europe where they have lived for thousands of years, any damage they would have done to the ecosystem would have happened millenia ago.",

We had a strict policy of not adopting to college students, although we would let college students foster the cats for several months until they were adopted into a permanent home. \n\nOur biggest problem was 19 year old college kids coming in after spending like 2 hours on Reddit watching cat gifs and wanted to adopt a cat.  The president of the rescue center was this super nice kind frail little lady who never had a problem just flat out refusing to send a cat home with someone who obviously moved around a lot or was in a precarious life situation (students, low income, etc).",

In order to adopt from a shelter or rescue, you are asked to submit a credit check, a full background check with fingerprints, get a top secret CIA security clearance, submit to 25 unannounced home visits for the next 10 years, get a second mortgage on your house, equip the pet with a tracking device so the shelter knows where the pet is at all times, have a 6 bedroom mansion on 500 acres of land with a fully fenced backyard, have a live-in pet caretaker, never leave the pet unsupervised for more than 30 seconds, and sacrifice your firstborn son just in order to fill out the application. \n\nI'm exaggerating, but some of the hoops you have to jump through are insane. I get that they want to weed out people who don't take it seriously, but some shelters have swung too far the opposite direction and make it damn near impossible for the average person to adopt. I know a lot of people who just got a dog/cat from a breeder or Craigslist because the shelters' expectations were insane and drove away anyone who didn't want to be a full-time stay-at-home pet-caretaker.",

I think they must not have even read the application.\n\n(I\u2019m not proud of that, and I would very strongly advise everyone not to make such an impulsive and reckless decision about getting a pet. But for the record, we\u2019ve had her for 6 years now, she\u2019s extremely spoiled with immense love and very very careful attention, and luckily she absolutely loved traveling.)",

It doesn't matter if his motivations were selfish (however you define that) or not. What matters is if the animal has a good life with him.  The guy works from home and takes the dog to a park three times a day. That's a much better life than most of the indoor dogs I see in the city, and more one on one attention than many dogs working on a farm would get. \n\nI get that in a perfect world, all aussies would live on big farms with fully engaged owners who spend 10 hours a day with them, but we live in an imperfect world. It's good that animal shelters screen people looking to adopt, but if they try to ensure no animal ever has an adverse experience they're going to filter out a lot of potential good owners. And the animals that would've been adopted either live the shelter the rest of their lives or are euthanized.",

I decided the second was the humane option except life doesn't go quietly into the night and I made another mistake thinking a hard, well placed whack on the head with a shovel would do the trick. You guessed it, not at all. It stunned the rabbit but after a moment it started trying to run and scream but now it was missing back legs (cat's doing) and it was jerking around like it had a huge internal head bleed. I hit it again, and then again, and then again. The thing wouldn't die. At this point I'm throughly traumatized by the whole experience and realizing with every inept swing how cruel I've made what was a natural predator prey moment, so I turned the shovel on the edge, placed against the neck and stepped down decapitating the baby bunny. Finally it stopped screaming and I have never ever again tried to take away a catch from any cat I own. They can clearly kill more humanely than I and that includes when they 'play' with their food as cats are apt to do.",

First chance she got she bolted out the door at our house. Took a couple hours to coax her out from under the deck. She's bolted a couple of times, have always been able to catch her or at least redirect her before she's gotten in to trouble.\n\nEvery cat is unique, I'm sure there's one out there that'd be fine here.

They only kept the cats outdoors even in the freezing winter but would but heated blankets in boxes/kennels in the open lean-to garage.  Those boxes became snack buffets in the winter for the coyotes.    After getting to know them over a few years, I finally asked him about it with the intention of dissuading him from adopting cats.  They literally did it to keep the rodent population down. They didn\u2019t really care about the cats.  That was also when I learned they only minimally fed the cats which is also so fucked up.",

I'm not making the same arguments for humans though, of course a human wouldn't be happy never going outside. Cats are not an outdoor pet, and should always be kept indoors.\n\nOnly matching your tone, why would you assume I have a \"fuck everywhere else\" mindset first?",

But yeah, I'm sure that had no impact on the local ecosystem whatsoever. So I say again, lol.\n\nKeep your cats indoors, folks.",

Cats are one of the least to worry about though. \n\nSmall dogs can be prey for a pack, so can cats, but honestly the latter are much more resilient.  They can slip into pretty small spaces and they are still pretty wild.  We had cats that disappeared for months and just wander back.  Or make a lot more cats somewhere...also who all survived (get your pets spayed and neutered kids).  And near the house they would always have somewhere to hide in anyway, like a shed or a pile of something.\n\nOriginal post probably is in no way true.  Like, raised house cats suddenly left outside alone near a known pack with nowhere to shelter? Maybe...but still quite sure it's made up.  No one's that stupid?",

I have found that people who leave the cats outside generally either don't want to keep it entertained or they got it for their kids and just don't want to deal with it. Another neighbor had a cat have kittens repeatedly despite me bringing her back to them multiple times to warn them that male cats were prowling her (she was young and was hiding in our garage a few times from them). They didn't listen unfortunately. Another case of 'it's for our kids, I don't want to be responsible'.\n\nFortunately there's only good cat owners up the other street now though. The cats are mostly outdoors, one of them was a stray that I don't think wants to be inside, but they all remain on that street and are neutered. But even one of those disappeared last year... unsure if something got it or if he might've been sick and wandered off to pass away, but generally I did always see all of their cats on that street.",

Owners say their cat knows what they're doing but obviously no and they're still at risk. Of being run over, wild animals, disease, poisoning. Inside they're safe from all that and will get over wanting to go out.  So I'm not sorry for saying you don't love your cats if you let them outside. Get a leash and train them if it's that important to you.",

The pest control market size market size in the UK doubled in 10 years:\n\nhttps://www.ibisworld.com/united-kingdom/market-size/pest-control/\n\nSome humane pest control methods exist, but they're not very popular because they're less effective and more expensive. Which is why we have people putting poison down and installing spikes. Both of these methods have very undesirable side effects, such as inadvertently poisoning non pest species, and maiming but not killing birds.\n\nSo what's a natural solution to this? Domestic cats! Domestic cat's closest neighbour genetically is, you guessed it, the European wildcat.\n\nSince we can't practically reintroduce the European wildcat without destroying all the settlements we've built, the next best thing is the domestic cat.\n\nLetting pet cats outside in Europe is actually a way to reverse one of the major effects humans in Europe have had on the environment.",

Feral cats typically rely on caretakers in the community for food and shelter, especially in cold areas. Feral and dumped house cats die from predators, cars, exposure to elements, and disease. Without caretakers they live very short lives. They depend on humans even if they don\u2019t have homes.\n\nI mean this whole post is about how cats are being picked off by coyotes.

And it\u2019s not just food that an animal needs to survive. They need the ability to withstand the cold and find shelter. Cats typically can\u2019t do this on their own - at least not enough to live healthy lives.",

Lots of cats that grew up with 'street skills', but you don't go get an outdoor cat from a shelter and not even every stray or 'street' cat is cut out for it. Our youngest is a kitten we rescued from in-town a couple months ago. During the first big snowstorm my wife heard a kitten crying for help, likely separated from it's mother during the storm.

Did this for so long people would just pull up and  drop a cat off . \n So many cats that everything smelled of cat piss . They would get in my shop where my riding mower and motorcycles were . Stunk like crazy . Cat prints over any car outside , and always hearing cats in heat getting it on etc etc.  Basically feral cats she feed .\n She would sit outside and feed them , but after some compilations with her diabetes and another illness she would just pour out a huge amount of cat food on 2 baking sheets by the back door . When I left for work at 5 AM I started noticing a few coyotes eating the cat food .  After 2 weeks I might walk out to seeing 8 or more .  I warned my cat loving neighbor but she told me that the cats were smart enough to stay away from the coyotes and plus \u201c coyotes don\u2019t really eat cats \u201c  Seems that was a myth as she was concerned.\n Within less than 2 months we had zero cats here except for this crazy 3 legged one that would hiss at me from my roof and I once saw catch and kill a squirrel.",
