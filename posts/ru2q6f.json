This goes way beyond just denting a motor vehicle and could dramatically change the course of an innocent life.\n\nThugs just shouldn't end up policing.",

You can\u2019t claim self defense because you shot someone then run away and people chase you down so you shoot them too. If that is true then I can take a rifle to the zoo, jump into the Gorilla enclosure, start strolling around like I own the place? Then when a gorilla comes at me I can shoot it, shoot a couple more and claim it was self defense because that gorilla scared me. That is what Rittenhouse did. Injected himself into a dangerous situation without good cause then shot someone because he got scared. On top of that he did not report it he called his friend to brag about what he did then left the scene. And when people tried to stop him he shot two of those people.",

Now here is where I admit I don\u2019t know if this fact is true or not but if I remember correctly, rosenbaum had Kyle down and was actively trying to take his gun. Why? Sadly we can\u2019t ask him however I can make an educated guess that it would be to use it on him. That is when Kyle shot rosenbaum 4 times and after the second shot is when he starts to turn away.",

I actually like that he was found innocent because it means people (mostly minorities such as myself) can reference this case when they defend themselves. Rittenhouse did shoot 3, killing 2, however he did act in self defense. He did not attack anyone prior to shooting and was running away from people who kept chasing him, grabbed his weapon or was in a life threatening situation with 2 people with their own weapons. Looking at the facts when someone runs away from you, you are not in danger irregardless of them having weapons or not. Kyle was running away and was still attacked when he shot the 3 people.",

Relevant passage:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Jordan scored a 33 on the [WPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderlic_test), above the median for any listed occupation, and well over the normative median of 21 suggested for a police patrol officer.  \n>  \n>Applying that lenient standard of review, we conclude that even absent a strong proven statistical correlation between high scores on the Wonderlic test and turnover resulting from lack of job satisfaction, it is enough that the city believed -- on the basis of material prepared by the test maker and a letter along similar lines sent by the LEC -- that there was such a connection. Plaintiff presented some evidence that high scorers do not actually experience more job dissatisfaction, but that evidence does not create a factual issue, because it matters not whether the city's decision was correct so long as it was rational.\n\nEdit: It was the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, not the Supreme Court.",

Both the officer and the accuser are protected. The police is taken out of service, to skid any further controversy on the investigation (but they remain innocent until proven guilty) meanwhile the accuser is protected because the officer temporarily loses *the power to further harass* until they are proven innocent.\n\nNow that the investigations themselves have their own controversy. Or more importantly that the system is broken and unbalanced is a separate issue (and in many ways the more serious one).",

We should not engage in built by association.\n\nWe're not talking about police corruption and collaboration, we're (or at least I am) talking specifically about the morality on whether or not we should provide paid leave to citizens and whether it's right to provide it to police.\n\nEvery citizen should be provided this state-given ability to have paid leave before a guilty verdict.",

That is why I brought it up, I do not disagree that it is wrong. The \u201cproblem\u201d with my thinking, If you\u2019d like to call it that, is that I am aware of dozens of ways in which the state justice apparatus disproportionately protects its own from the injustices it commits, and am thus inclined to point out when it is the case to highlight the overall issue. A law that protects all citizens from this treatment would include officers, and is obviously what a just system would strive to do.",

This ex police officer served as a lookout for his (I can't believe I have to say alleged) rapist partner and lied about it.\n\nLying under oath as a police officer should have equivalent or longer sentence than the crime they lied about. I am very troubled by the judge. Justice was NOT served.\n\n\u00bb The exoneration of the two former officers on the most serious charges incited outrage among women\u2019s groups and others. They held rallies and organized petitions asking the judge to sentence the former officers, who were fired after their convictions on official misconduct, to the maximum: two years in jail.\n\n\u00bb In sentencing Mr. Mata, 29, Justice Carro was not as scolding or as angry as he was two days earlier, when he addressed Mr. Moreno, 43. Instead, the judge seemed disappointed and baffled by Mr. Mata\u2019s conduct.\n\n\u00bb Prosecutors had accused Mr. Moreno of raping the woman, whom he and Mr. Mata were called to help into her fifth-floor apartment in December 2008. After the officers escorted her up, surveillance cameras captured them returning to the apartment three times. \n\n\u00bb Mr. Moreno and Mr. Mata said that the woman had asked them to return and that Mr. Moreno was counseling her about her drinking. Both officers were charged with rape, but prosecutors said Mr. Mata had only served as Mr. Moreno\u2019s lookout.\n\nhttps://archive.fo/TL4dT",

Again, I understand that. There's more of a story in corruption. Good cops also hate the crooked ones. It makes our job harder but that's a minor point really. More importantly, stories of corruption stop victims coming forward because they have no faith in the police. We have to do better. \n\nThe best cop I have ever known worked city centre. I worked alongside him for years. This guy had the gift of the gab, we say. He was able to talk situations down, de-escalate most things.\n\nWe used to get a lot of suicides and threatened jumpers because there was a river that drew people to it. For anonymity purposes, I'll call him Dave. Dave and I talked more people down than any other cops. I don't know why we were generally first on scene with these folks, but we were. Dave had 100% success. Never lost one. I wasn't so lucky. I don't talk about that. \n\nAnyway, we get a call of a jumper. Dave and I get there first. Dave gets out onto the edge with him, I stay behind a pillar ready to grab if needed. I heard everything. Teenage boy, taken from his crackhead parents due to negligence. He lived with his gran. She died and there was no where left so he ended up in a home with several other young people. They bullied him. They stole his bike. They stole his clothes. He had nothing. He thought that jumping was his only option, the natural order of things.\n\nDave talked this kid down. This kid was taken to our back office and I bought him something to eat. Poor lad was starved. Dave disappeared for a bit. At the end of the shift, Dave had used all the contacts and influence he'd developed by being a good guy and helping other out. The kid had a new bike, donated by a bike shop Dave had helped. New clothes, a phone to stay in touch with friends. And most importantly, social services had moved this kid after Dave pestered them. He ended up in a Foster home. All these things were donated or volunteered, albeit begrudgingly from social services but that's another story! Dave checks in on him every now and then to see how he's doing.\n\nThere are good cops.\n\nTLDR - a good cop I know used all he could to help a suicidal kid out.",

He was actively putting out fires and helping prior the events. \n\n>Anything can be explained without looking at the bigger picture\n\nNo, that actually isn't true. Most criminal cases can't be explained away, it works in this scenario because its pretty cut and dry self defense. The only reason it was even brought to court was because of politics, Kyle was never going to be convicted. \n\n>go to a right wing meet up armed\n\nIf you were busy putting out fires, were attacked and then proceeded to run away. And then, while running, you were attacked multiple times and consistently attempted to run away and only then, after being attacked on the ground with a weapon you fought back and only shot the person actively attacking you. Then attempted to run away again and avoid contact except when being attacked *again*, then yes. It would be self defense. Because you actively attempted to avoid confrontation multiple times. \n\nI'd still call you an idiot for doing so, but it would be self defense.",

This DOES NOT APPLY TO THINGS WHICH ARE PART OF THEIR JOBS BUT ILLEGAL FOR CIVILIANS! Do you understand now?",

You never mentioned this. Was I supposed to read your mind?\n\nI can't believe you're in your forties given the way you're blaming me for your failure to communicate. Grow up.

You can just be cool with me, knock, show me the warrant at the door, come in and be respectful.\n\nThe cops that came into my house weren\u2019t there to do a search, they were there to dehumanize me and destroy property.

                              "text": "You\u2019re joking right? \n\nDaniel Shaver - Cops got a call about a gun pointing out a hotel window. Daniel Shaver was in the hallway of a hotel, cooperating with the cops, crying, on his knees, unarmed, pleading for his life and crying before he was executed. Cop was charged with manslaughter. The cop literally had \u201cget fucked\u201d engraved on his gun. The cop was found not guilty. The public after much time has passed now has the full bodycam footage, but too late. RIP Daniel.\n\nPhilando Castile - A simple traffic stop with him and his girlfriend in the vehicle, and was asked for his license and registration. Philando, upholding transparency, informed the cop he has a gun inside the vehicle. The cop told Philando not to grab it then, to which he said he obviously wasn\u2019t going to. The cop then shot him point blank five times\u2026 five\u2026. after both him and his girlfriend were saying he\u2019s reaching for the documents the officer requested. The officer was acquitted of all charges.\n\nCharles Kinsey - A mental health therapist and his patient who an officer stumbled upon while out during a different call because he noticed a situation of distress. The pair were sitting on the ground as Charles was trying to comfort the patient who had just run away from a group home. Charles was lying on the ground with his hands in the air, yelling they were both unarmed and not to shoot, as he was just a mental health therapist tending to his patient. The officer open-fired 3 shots anyways, claiming to not have heard any of that even though his fellow officers had. Charles was shot in the leg, handcuffed, and left bleeding with no medical attention until ambulance arrived 20 minutes later. \n\nAnd should I even bother mentioning the countless bodycam footage you can find online of people getting gunned down by police when running away? Sure, they may not be compliant by running away, but being unarmed and running away is not grounds for killing.\n\nEdit: Why not, here\u2019s some more.\n\nRyan Whitaker - Playing video games with his girlfriend, officers arrived to a noise complaint call. Ryan answered knocking at his door, not knowing it was the police, with a gun held down to his side. When he opened the door, the officers saw the weapon and yelled to drop the gun and get down. Panicked, Ryan immediately lowered the gun and himself to the ground but was immediately shot mid-comply. Sure, armed, if you ignore the context. The altercation occurred in less than 5 seconds.\n\nTony Timpa - Not a shooting, but still unfortunately a loss of life. Suffering from an episode, Tony called 911 asking for help as he told dispatch he was off his schizophrenia meds. The officers arrived, handcuffed him, zip-tied his legs, and one officer put their body weight on his back and neck. Tony kept screaming that he couldn\u2019t breath and that he was going to die. The officers laughed and made jokes. After 9 minutes, Tony was motionless. Paramedics arrived and Tony was found to be deceased.\n\nSarah Wilson - This is more of an questionable eye-brow raise, but I\u2019m mentioning it due to its absurdity. During a traffic stop with her boyfriend, Sarah was handcuffed and detained and separated from him. Despite being seated and cuffed with hands behind her back, the department claims that she grabbed an unattended gun, contorted her body to fit the barrel in her mouth, and shot herself in the head when the detaining officer had briefly walked away to assist the officer detaining Sarah\u2019s boyfriend. Again, with hands cuffed behind her back, she was able to place a gun into her mouth and commit suicide, according to the police reports. Bodycams were present, but stopped recording before the incident of death. Take that as you will.",

If the pay is not adequate than maybe they should stop watching Faux news and voting against their our own benefit. No one can have their cake and eat it too.",

Notice he looks around calmly to make sure no one is watching than slams the door into the car once, realizes that caused insufficient damage and slams it again much harder. There is an attitude among a lot of police that anyone they're interacting with is guilty they want to make sure they pay one way or another. I was in a one car rollover accident in the middle of the night years ago and the cop assumed I was drunk but when I blew a 0.00 on his breathalyzer, he claimed I walked it off and said \"I know you were drunk but can't prove it so I'm going to issue you enough traffic tickets you lose your license anyway\". Luckily the judge didn't see it that way and only upheld the speeding ticket I freely admitted to.",

He was suspended and charged with manslaughter, at trial the judge dropped the charges because in Illinois firing into a crowd is so reckless that it rises to murder. The DA intentionally mis-charged servin to let him walk and then he was allowed to resign and keep his pension. The DA's office secured several successful convictions for murder under this law just the year prior, so ignorance can't be argued. The DA fully understood this legal theory\n\nThe article doesn't even say that he's been charged, just the charges are pending even though this happened almost a year ago. Charges don't mean shit, pull your head out of your ass",

I just now check the NYS state criminal docket and there are [no charges](https://imgur.com/rW32Bvl) pending for a Brandon Huckle. I looked up a few random article of crimes in NY, even found one by an [NYPD officer](https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny-off-duty-nypd-cop-arrested-for-punching-his-boyfriend-on-queens-street-20211026-i65pxh6w5nep5jftzqubxc27pq-story.html), and were able to return [their charges](https://imgur.com/a/1aBw3Sf) no problem, so i know the search is functioning properly. \n\n\nI'd love for you to prove that he's been charged for this criminal act. [Here's](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/webcrim_attorney/DefendantSearch) the docket search, see what you come up with. Because to me, it seems like he wasn't charged at all and you fell for a bunch of bullshit and now want other people to buy into the stupid shit you fell for bc",

I think you would probably have no response from local media, especially if you're calling them out for carrying water for police and publishing inaccurate information based solely on the word of police.\n\nI did go back and look, the story about the charges is credited to \"staff\" so there's no one to even follow up with. This is generally done on purpose, notice that it was the local TV station and not newspaper that this information was laundered through. TV journalism is sloppy at best and basically functions as stenographers for law enforcement. There are rarely bylines which further serves to obfuscate responsibility for this activity\n\nI did double check the contact info for the station, they had a email address for tips and a phone number about school closures. I'll email the tip line about the fact that no charges have been filed in this case but I expect to hear nothing in response. I don't think it's overly conspiratorial to think that this is being swept under the rug, that's standard operating procedure when it comes to police officers behaving badly. This, lying to the media and then sitting on things until it goes away, is the norm and there's no conspiracy in thinking that",

Also, \"conspiracy\" gets a lot of bad play and has negative connotations attached to it however, by definition what you are alleging is a conspiracy of the local law enforcement/justice system to protect a criminal. So that's the language I'm using. There is certainly the possibility that what you are alleging is true - however, I live by the principle that \"Exceptional claims require exceptional evidence.\" To me, this situation certainly falls into that category. As it stands, there is conflicting information available regarding this case and you are asking me to essentially fully forego my faith in the ability of the justice system to carry out its purpose. I think, in order to take that position, further, more exact evidence is required.",

As he walked away he allowed his keys to scratch my car which I had just freshly gotten painted the week before and when I told him something he gave me a second ticket which was a fix it ticket for modified exhaust which at that time was stock. Next day he had someone else pull me over for speeding when I was doing 25 in a 25. Small town cops can sometimes be the worst ones.",

Mom, i dont know who hurt you, but nobody has behaved like that to me so far. You were just being a douche because you were the one in a position of power",

No cop can be hired without cop insurance. If a cop is being bad, their rates go up (like a bad driver's rate would increase with an auto policy). If a cop damages property, cop insurance has to pay for it and the rate goes up. If a cop kills or injures someone, the insurance company does an independent investigation and maybe drops the cop's policy, rendering them unemployable based on the findings.\n\nThis would help to fix bad behavior and alleviate the taxpayer burden.",

              "text": "Yes, if they have a warrant. However, police officers may try to conduct a warrantless search, which is allowed with the consent of the property resident or owner. This is the tricky part because they don\u2019t have to specifically ask for consent; one common wording is \u201cI\u2019m going to search your car, ok?\u201d The phrasing is meant to make you think you don\u2019t get to say no, that\u2019s it\u2019s a declarative statement, but you do. They are in fact asking you to be allowed to search. You should not let officers conduct this search without your lawyer present. Anything they find or you say may be used against you in a court of law as it has become a legal search with your consent.\n\nAfter consented searches, you get reasonable suspicion searches. In which case you should, once again, say you don\u2019t consent to the search, but do not try to physically stop them. With these types of searches, you will want a lawyer and they can handle the facts after the matter. The court will rule if the evidence they find during this type of search was a legal search or if was a 4A violation. So let your lawyer handle that.\n\nRemember the best thing you can do, whether you did anything or not, is to identify yourself, reject any requests to search, and specifically request a lawyer to represent you. Say nothing else except to do those things.",

If he was still protected, he wouldn\u2019t have been fired. \n\nIt seems like you all just see a downvoted comment and downvote too just assuming it has to be wrong.

I remember he was the last of my family that was brought out. I'll never forget them making him walk down the steps of the porch with no cane. It fucking infuriated me. \n\nThen I've got my sister who was in middle school next me. It's 9 pm so we were getting ready to go to bed and were in our sleeping clothes. The cops standing over us were shining the flashlights of their guns up and down looking at her body. While we are facedown handcuffed. \n\nThey trashed the house put holes in the walls. Turns out they hit the wrong house. They meant to be raiding a known spot a few houses down. I guess they just chalked it up to a whoopsie. \n\nThis was my first encounter with police. They never really got better. Cops weren't good people where I'm from. To sit by and watch and allow it is the same as doing it to me.",

But the original point wasn't a statistical analysis, it was an attempt to disparage the U.S.A. \n\n>Or if someone shared a hospital bill for $500k, it happens.. oh wait, no.. it\u2019s only US..\n\nYes, I get it. I recognize the flaws in the U.S.A., but you have to recognize when there's a discussion of flaws vs a remark meant as an insult, and that was clearly the latter.\n\n>So no, no one is generalizing that any of these things are US-only.

Malpractice/professional bonding is an easy enough concept to make sense of and an easy argument to make for implementation, but I don't quite feel like it's quite enough bite for the worst of the bad apples and power trippers inside what we would all hope to rehabilitate back into positive effective stewards of public trust and fairness. Stuff like this goes especially heinous because of the obvious power imbalance of the situation, and our perceptions of the kind of people who would maliciously do shit like this. If they're capable of this dumb and petty stuff, who's to say they won't take a bribe, or beat on an inmate, or happily juke stats? And you, me, we all realize that dear God, these people rising to the tops of their power structures are part of the goddamn problem. Because it's been happening! The solution I've been thinking in is a new federal crime: breach of the public trust. To wit, I propose that any sworn officer of any American legal system who is found committing egregious criminal acts or documented patterns of abuse are subject to federal time, existing penalties, and a new class of penalties regarding forfeiture of privileges to hold a badge, bar pass, or a public office on any level from lengths of times ranging from years to lifetime. A no fly list for bad public servants who should never ever be near positions of power or authority ever again.",

Yes, in firefighting some things need to be broken to gain access or vent a roof but sometimes they just do it for the thrill of it.  I have seen an \u201cofficer\u201d punch out the screens on a screened in porch when there was and open door two feet over, break every window on the first floor of a house, use a 12 ton excavator to knock down a garage because fire had spread to an inaccessible attic portion and destroy a classic car that could have been driven out.  I am not sure why people do this, maybe because they think insurance will cover the repairs?",

Even if he parked reasonably, the gate would hit his bumper (it\u2019s a really bad spot to park in), but he pulled up so far that I had to squeeze through the gate as it would only open a foot or two before hitting his bumper. Needless to say, every time I left the house to take my dog out, I used the back gate instead of the front door out of spite.",

Again they are not the only ones that see these things but are the only ones in our society charged with enforcing laws and apprehending violators of laws while dealing with the mental issues that stem from witnessing traumatic events.

If you do rewatch, be aware he's not the only one, and even without fatality, the hate some officers have, are a threat to publics safety, not protectors of it.. which is/was their initial job.. go ahead watch Floyd's video.)\n\nStill like \"not all cops are men.. well, apparently.. just the bald ones are: dicks.\"\n\nDon't worry, it's not sexiest: A women officer, still has a baton... & can be just as much a dick, while your beaten, with a \"black dildo\".. saying: \"yes mitress\"  ..I ment \"baton\".\n\nBeing a cop is hard AF. Imo, all cop with anger issues, really need to be alloud to use marijuana.  Hell, they should be allowd, to smoke with suspects, then.. we'd both remember.. \"we're both people\", on both sides.\n\nStill not conviced.. Imagine \ud83d\udcad\"wasting an officers time\" then legally, being aloud to pass them a blunt and they say \"thank you\" &: \"dealing, with your complaining nabor, will be alot more tolable now.\" Instead of making the guy/girl a criminal for having a \"drug\".

I\u2019m not a cop hater like 90% of Reddit and one thing I want to say is that while so many people hate on police (yes some deserve the hate because there are some shit people who wear the badge) but most people probably couldn\u2019t lace their boots. Police see dismembered bodies at crashes daily and are the first ones at most crashes, shootings, stabbings etc and begin rendering aid immediately. Ambulances and fire are very seldom first on scene. Police have to deal with the absolute worst people of society daily to include cartels, street gangs and terrorists, rapist, child molesters. You don\u2019t hear about all the truly evil people they apprehend daily and cannot back down and walk away from fight or threat of death when someone decides they aren\u2019t going to jail. The level of disrespect by the public to all police over the actions of a few only makes the us vs them mentality worse. So instead of bashing them all. Maybe try to bash the ones who deserve and thank the ones that keep our society functional.",

I\u2019m also not so ignorant to believe that police work can be perfected and I understand just like with military there will be bad actors.

Some because the neighborhood they grew up in you had two\nChoices gangs and drugs, and they do the job to make their neighborhood a better place.
