Then I change the post to \"I love people that kill babies.\" It then skews the whole meaning of the original comment thus negating the likes/awards.\n\nAnd although I may have learned something today, I'll leave the edit because I don't want to change the meaning of the commenter below me who tagged a subreddit.

After week 1 start with your next common meal and try to find a way to shave a little bit of that off, and stick with that for a while too. After week 2 pick a third common meal and do the same. Once it's been a couple months and you're mentally adjusted to that being normal you can revisit your first meal type and shave off another little bit. Then go through the other meals trimming one at a time like you did before. Hold those portions for a couple months. Rinse and repeat. Depending on how you go about it, by half of a year to a year you'll be eating half or less than you did before and it will feel normal, and you'll start a downward trend on your weight. Don't get distracted by the scale. You won't start seeing gains until later on.\n\nThe best diet is one you can stick to, and you've likely proven you can stick to the foods you commonly eat. Focus on slimming those foods and the weight will eventually follow.\n\nThe calories you burn when you're asleep, the calories you burn when you're awake and sedentary/active, and the calories from your largest and most consistent meals are the dominant forces in your system. Make continual improvements on the balance of those forces and your weight will trend downwards, slowly accelerating as you go. Snacking and exercise (outside of extended and intense exercise) are just noise that add little offsets to that main trend.",

Got into it with Red when I was 10. Eventually stopped playing as it was something I hid from most of my friends, was afraid I\u2019d get made fun of, and didn\u2019t play it in high school. Eventually I got back into it with the roms in college.  Then Pok\u00e9mon Go came out and it was a great game that helped me get a lot more social. A few months ago I bought my first Pok\u00e9mon game since Yellow so it was fun to play a bit.  What\u2019s your favorite Pok\u00e9mon?",

Also, I see how you like animal abuse due to playing Pokemon so fucking much. So I guess that means you want people to abuse you. Also, are you actually good at gaming? You look like you're poor and can't even afford a computer case. Also, I almost thought nikocado avocado had a clone, till I realized he doesn't like pokemon, and he makes better videos than I bet you do. Also, the fat in your body must make you pretty energetic, so much that your art is probably a bunch of squiggly lines. Also, if you were to move, it would take half the population to move you by a single centimeter. Also, if you say it's just the mirror, then you have a crappy-ass mirror. You probably found it on craigslist if it's true, which I would know it isn't since you don't touch grass, as I said earlier.",
