Putin shot someone trying to run against him dead 10 years ago today, right in front of the kremlin. He poisoned multiple times others standing up to him poisoned someone while on British soil. He jailed the last person trying to run against him in the \u201celection\u201d cause he was making headway and might win. He\u2019s still in jail I think. he absolutely would murder an entire platoon and make them disappear if it suited him. JFC. They are not told anything but disinformation and lies!

The political culture among elected officials was so bad that they really believed Hitler could be a \"useful idiot\".  That gave him space to form a paramilitary group of white supremacists to intimidate, attack, and murder political opponents.  It stayed at the level of \"plausible deniability\" until the judicial system was stacked with Nazi sympathizers, at which point no one could be held to account.\n\nIt's easy to go to war when everyone willing to openly oppose the Party is leaving the country, in prison, or six feet under.  The propaganda was so everyone else could rationalize their behavior.",

Like, think about it - you are a great country, an empire, with a royal family connected to every other country. New technologies are being developed, life is good. Then war started (because Kaiser was an idiot) they lost and became the shade of their own glory. Poor, hated and on the bottom. And there came Hitler, with his speeches, flags, parades and a plan how to give people jobs and prosperity, to bring back their dignity back. So they followed him. And even when Russians came, they fought for their homes. Not for him. For their country. Germans, you can say what you want , are patriots as well.\n\nOh, and there was no internet or any media or info access than radio or newspapers. So they believed it. \n\nLike I said - different times.\n\nNow all what most people wants is peace, freedom and just a good life.",

Russia's central bank has 600 billion in foreign currency reserves, stockpiled to fund this war. But, it only has like 20 million in hard currency in it's vaults. It sounds like the 600 billion warchest has been frozen by the US and EU. The US did this to Iran in the 70's.\n\nThat could have devastating economic consequences as Russia littererally imports everything and only produces basic commodities (wheat and oil). With no reserves Russia can't import stuff. It can't make anything. Russia's economy is going to be reduced to sending trains of gold to China to barter for clothes, cars, machinery, littererally everything. One can only imagine the premium China would charge and the broader economic damage.",

While NATO is a defense organization, it aggressively pushes its sphere of influence. The entire western world has rallied behind US and their sphere of influence is ever increasing. China is also constantly throwing money at countries for \"development\" so they can form ties and increase their influence. \n\nInvading Ukraine is Russia's hail mary attempt in gaining back some influence. They dont have the economical resources like the west so they had to start a military campaign to gain that. \n\nWhy would they want to increase their influence? The reason why the entire world was silent when US invaded Iraq. If NATO manages to get most of the countries sharing border with Russia to their side, they can choke Russia easily.  Russia has good reason to be afraid of increasing NATO's influence. However, starting a war over it is unacceptable. They should do what the West is doing and earn their influence.",

I am glad Ukraine is not only holding out, but doing better than I ever imagined they would and I hope they successfully repel the Russian invaders.\n\nBut as this goes on I become more concerned. Clearly Putin thought this would be a walk in the park and expected to have defeated the Ukrainian military and ousted the government by now. I\u2019m sure he expected to do this before the west would have time to react in any meaningful way. But now the sanctions are building and the supplies are being provided to Ukraine.  Then I watch footage of a Ukrainian man offering Russian troops a lift back to the border after they ran out of fuel, some Ukrainian guy moving a Russian land mine with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, and another Ukrainian stealing a Russian APC with a tractor whilst someone films and laughs I\u2019m starting to feel slightly embarrassed for Russia myself. So I wonder how Putin feels and how he will react as he becomes more desperate with the corner he has painted himself into.",

They're fighting an army of battle hardened \"rebels\" who have been at war for almost a decade in Crimea and a civilian population that's dedicated to protecting their homes while being supplied weapons and more importantly intelligence from their western alliances.\n\nThese young men have families, girlfriends, wives, significant others that they want to return home safely to and with no real conviction to fight and die I don't blame them at all for finding reasons to peacefully turn themselves over as POW's. They know they won't be treated poorly or tortured like they would if they deserted from the Army within Russia or Russian controlled areas. Plus none of them have any significant Intel so it's not worth interrogating them.\n\nThe only theory that kind of scares me is this being a part of a plan to justify escalation in levels of attacks and violence from Putin by claiming the huge amount of captured soldiers are being killed, tortured, raped etc... by the Ukrainians.\n\nWho the fuck knows though.... Maybe this is all just one really poorly planned cluster fuck from Russia and we're all giving Putin and his advisors way too much credit.",

I've told the story here before how I was knocked down by an NYPD police horse as they surrounded us and simultaneously yelled at us to get off the sidewalk and get out of the street as they crushed a bunch of college students between them. Eventually they let most of us go detaining one of us for a while because they claimed he was throwing fireworks. He was searched and released. For protesting an injust war. We're not nearly as free here as some people like to pretend. I'd happily fuck off to Canada or New Zealand if they'd have me.",

I know the politicians all said our mission was just to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait, but the general feeing was that we were roaring towards Baghdad.  I also know that the military was roundly criticized by more than a few politicians and armchair warriors because we didn't go to Baghdad.\n\nKnow why we didn't go to Baghdad?  We were that low on fuel and ammunition.  When the advance was halted, we still had enough fuel for some maneuvering and enough ammunition to defend ourselves, but we didn't have enough of either to continue on the attack.  We had to wait for the supply elements to catch up.\n\nThe Russians are limited, just as we were, by logistics.",

Ukrainians are basically left to a citizen\u2019s defense that has them battling a foreign invader in their neighborhoods.

The idea that they'd make up some story about \"forgetting\" to fill up their vehicle and get arrested because they asked police for gas is a very believable one. \"Yes officer, we're Russian and we ran out of gas in our Military Vehicle, we're part of the Russian Army, and we're illegal migrants from Russia, we also stole some liquor a few blocks back, did we mention that we're Russian?\"",

It isnt like the knowledge of how to make them will just vanish from the Earth. All of a sudden the entire world becomes a hostage to that country with zero way to fight back. \n\nMAD really seems to be the only solution here in my eyes. Unless everyone has a counter punch, there is no deterrent to someone else using a nuke. \"But that would ruin the world.\" Yeah, and? Madmen don't really care. The only way to properly deter the use of nuclear arms is to threaten retaliation.",

Like a kid from the hollers of West Virginia being sent to Europe to fight in WWII. Expect those soldiers were much better-equipped, with rational (and often excellent) military leaders, and actually were greeted as liberators.\n\nImagine an 18 (maybe 17) year-old boy (and I mean boy) who left school last year, at most having been yelled at to stop smoking in the bathroom, now being sent into a foreign country and being mobbed by adults who are calling for his death. Adults who don't even look much different than his own community. It's probably nightmarish, both in the fear of death and in the feeling, as we often have in nightmares, that we don't even know what we did.\n\nI feel for the kid.",

Go to Ukraine and tell Russian soldiers their wrong for whatever reason they may have for having the audacity to join their armed forces. That\u2019s sarcasm. The Russians are a forced military - conscription. They have no choice but to join, whether they have any objections or not. Whether they have familial ties to another country or not. Whether they agree with their head of state or commanding officer\u2026 or not. They just need a reason to avoid following a direct order (and within their chain of command - a lawful one). If they fought, ran out of supplies and then went to a place that, in all likelihood, had access to the fuel type they their vehicle required but were outgunned and \u201cforced to surrender\u201d, might be the difference in them or their families enduring a prison sentence or worse. So you would have them jeopardize their lives while doing what they can to seem like supporting soldiers? Virtue signaling only gets one so far in the real world, actions and strategy are what make survivors.",

This is to stop the tanks getting stranded, or running out of fuel/breaking down without back up and help. A single tank can easily be rendered useless. I can\u2019t believe an army the size of Russia (which wouldn\u2019t be possible without extremely proficient logistics) would send single tanks out that run out of fuel in the middle of an invasion. Since Russia started placing troops on the boarder they were reported to be building field hospitals, fuel depots etc. If the army was that stupid it wouldn\u2019t even overcome the logistical nightmare of an invasion. \n\nThe point I\u2019m trying to get to is that \u201cdo you believe Russia is really that incompetent to allow these stories to happen?\u201d \n\nAre these stories true about all this Russian incompetence? Are special forces soldiers (some of the most feared in the world) being wiped out by a civilian with an AK? Lone tanks running out of fuel in the middle of an invasion? Ace fighter pilots with 6 plane kill streaks? Ghost civilians taking out Russian regiments? Presidents leading battle charges on the front line? All seems a bit romantic, a bit bullshit? \n\nBtw: fuck Russia for invading. Fuck the media who we can\u2019t trust. Good luck to the Ukraine \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6",

(Assuming this story is true, that is).  I'm not surprised, true or not. \n\nI remember in 1991 when I was sent to act as a translator/driver for some of the crew (Russian) at an airshow.  We were assigned our passengers based on our language ability and actual military rank.  I got a couple of Russian Air Force generals and the top pilot.  The generals watched everything that went on--the air show was held on an American Air Force base (in the US).  They asked me why American military personnel, even the lowest-ranking ones, all displayed so much *initiative* (their choice of word, and it's the same word in Russian), just doing what needed to be done without having to be told or bullied into doing so.\n\nI didn't really have a good answer.  I explained that what they called *initiative* was partially due to American culture and society. I also pointed out that our military was all volunteer, no conscripts.  I wasn't completely satisfied with my answer.  Good or bad, it's just how Americans are, more or less.  Russians, not so much it seems.",

We were told something different.\u201d\n\nMany of the Russians inside Ukraine are conscripts, young people on contracts. Their contracts were changed overnight from military drills on the border to fighting in Ukraine and had all their cell phones confiscated. \n\nAlso from the NYT, the elite circle around Putin was shocked that he actually invaded Ukraine and are wondering what to do. \n\nSounds like Putin lied to everyone about what he was doing. Perhaps he thought that Kharkiv would fall quickly and surrender and that would cause other cities to follow, or he thought maybe the west would respond with military force and Putin would have successfully sparked WW3. That one would have follow the reasoning of lying to the young soldiers, they may very well have found other militaries in Ukraine under that scenario. \n\nWhatever Putin did he lied and he miscalculated. It\u2019s not going how he thought and now a lot of Russians are wondering what the fuck. If the soldiers were lied to and are finding out this could get very bad for the Russian govt very quickly. Oligarchs need to decide if this is a path they want to continue on. Also the Russian people are getting a little restless.",

Normal citizens are getting to be arrested and have who knows what happen to them, and yet they are still out there fighting for their lives, their families in both countries, and for their beliefs despite knowing they could end up like those before them. \n\nIt worries me, even though I may not be in that country, that people in my age group (young, able bodied people) are being put to war for the desires of a madman only to be killed or more hopefully put into the groups of POWs. They deserve to go back to their families and friends, not be forced to fight what shouldn't have been turned into a war. \n\nLet alone, there shouldn't be threats now of nuclear power on something like this. What's the point? Blow up your own soldiers and the country you're trying to 'free'? Its going to destroy the country hes trying to take and cause World War 3, which even less people want.\n\nNo one wanted this, any of this, except for one person who's greed outweighs his sensibility.",

When both sides think they\u2019re the \u2018good guy\u2019. Not just \u2018I\u2019m a soldier doing my job, fighting for my country\u2019. But honestly believing that they would be welcomed with open arms by Ukrainians is wild. \n\nThere\u2019s funny skits of comedians acting as German soldiers during WWI or II and the hilarity when they begin questioning themselves while in the trenches; \u2018Are we the baddies?\u2019 It\u2019s a hilarious and famous British comedy. But it speaks volumes. Who are the *bad* guys? [https://youtu.be/hn1VxaMEjRU](https://youtu.be/hn1VxaMEjRU)\n\nWell, the victors decide that. If Germany would\u2019ve won; the world would be drastically different and we\u2019d all be singing the praises of the German reich. History has always been written by the winners, good or bad seems irrelevant now, centuries or even millennia later. \n\nImagine all the past civilisations, whether they were \u2018good\u2019 or not, lost and buried under totalitarian regimes and Putinesque dictatorship. They wrote the stories we read today. They controlled the narrative of who was \u2018bad\u2019. \n\nIf Russia wins then (heaven forbid) they go on to rule the world in the future; then it\u2019s their turn to write history and spread their propaganda. Their \u2018truth\u2019 will be told to future generations and todays \u2018history\u2019 would teach of the evil West mind controlling precious Russians trapped in Ukraine, and the hero Putin liberated the true Russians of the \u2018Border\u2019 Country. \n\nSee how it works. You only know what you\u2019ve been taught. And quite often many of these lessons could even be a lie. Made up histories etc.",

If the Nato didn't interfere (for their own geopolitical interests, as usual), Russia wouldn't have needed to counter-attack.\n\nI'm far for being pro Russian, but it's very worrying to see how biaised your views are, and how you're not doing the minimum of research before spreading inexact statements, like you're just repeating what you hear here and there, without making any analytical effort or educating yourself. \n\nThe Nato can extermine developing countries in peace (and after all, they're still occupying Native American's territories), and do its best to diabolise the countries who won't just bow down in front of their political interference and former hegemony.
