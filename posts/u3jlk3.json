Bobbi was a hippie type who believed in astrology, pyramid power and magic.  Both Donna and Bobbi were diagnosed with breast cancer within a week of each other.  Donna took advantage of all that medical science has to offer.  She underwent a lumpectomy, did six rounds of chemotherapy and 14 sessions of radiation treatment.  Within 6 months she was declared in remission and remains healthy to this day.  Bobbi, on the other hand, was terrified of hospitals and doctors.  She decided that she would treat her breast cancer through \"the healing power of crystals\".  Within 6 months Bobbi was dead and remains so to this day.  \n\nJust sayin'.",
