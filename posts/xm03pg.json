It didnt work as many busts were related to those 'charitable events'. Part of prohibition was confiscating and destroying the alcoholic drinks. A moon shiner who makes his own spirits just for himself was just as criminal as any other, no more than someone who had their own private storage. You were expected to report it and turn it into the police as it was now contraband.\n\nMoonshine has only recently become legal in the turn of the century for your own consumption and production, and you can legally sell it assuming you have the proper licensing and pay taxes on said sold products. Most moonshiners still break the law under the current standings still as they say fuck taxes, but the argument of the FDA is its for saftey and not about taxes due to possible health risks due to moonshiner's 'creative' methods of distillery. Its not uncommon for moonshiners to use an old car radiator as part of the process, among other makeshift components that are lying around.",

Just look back at all the war stories, they just didn't consider them even a useful object if a women wasn't virgin and will mercilessly kill kids too. God doesn't care about children like how he orders to bash infants against rocks and gives constant threats on killing little children who have no involved with the matter .           \nYou are right they just want a virgin wife at home which will completely obey them while they fuck around as much as they won't. This hatred against women is quite clearly stated in Bible also and how they should be slave to their husband and I guess this line from Genesis summaries it all -\n\"I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.\"--Genesis 3:16.           \nMajorly any women who has control over her body and is independent won't ever agree with it and the hate it .",

They will be happy that conservatives will never hold THEM accountable for unplanned pregnancy per the usual (notice how almost NO anti-choice legislation targets the men who cause 100% of unplanned pregnancies?

Factors like humidity, light exposure, temperature etc can definitely break down medication. Having your aspirin in a dry, dark, cool cabinet for a decade will likely do close to nothing\n\nWhat\u2019s really funny is any sort of injectable medication, as well as BAC water. BAC water is literally isoprop alcohol + water, you add it to a vial of powdered medication so that you actually have something to inject. The expiration date on basically *anything* in a vial? 30 days. BAC water? 30 days. You\u2019re telling me that water+alcohol \u201cgoes bad\u201d 30 days after you open it lmfao? Everyone I\u2019ve known who\u2019s ever used BAC water, including myself, has a vial that literally years old. It\u2019s such bullshit, just an umbrella blanket amount to cover their ass.",

Do you suppose that \"supermajority\" just means that the president can write a bill and it pops into existence because he has more teammates? Do you think that somehow punishing the players on his team that don't agree with the bill would do any good beyond making it impossible to push any other bill during the majority?\n3. Republicans are already against abortion rights. What purpose does putting forth a bill to get shot down immediately as expected serve, especially given that every single time a bill shows up that should be supported (like the most recent money to disclose dark money in politics), people like you immediately say DEMOCRATS DONT ACTUALLY WANT THIS PASSED THIS IS ALL POLITICAL POSTURING, as they are quite literally right now doing.",

Kemp said he believed those decisions were indeed now up to the states but never said he\u2019d personally support a ban. So, there\u2019s a bit of exaggeration and hysteria on that narrow point.\n\nThat said, he signed and proudly defends the fetal heartbeat law which, even with a strong GOP majority,  passed by only 1 vote. So, a change in Governors and a slight change in the state legislature might lead to a repeal.",

But Kemp has specifically said he has \u201cNever opposed access to contraception\u201d and offered that response immediately after this controversy. Plus, he has not proposed a contraception ban or said he would sign one. \n\nSo, although I think his stance on abortion sucks and I absolutely want the law he signed to either be repealed at the state level or invalidated by federal legislation, I\u2019m just noting that the claim that Kemp wants to ban contraception is actually not supported by his statements or actions so far. \n\nFinally, I\u2019m pointing out how close we actually are (1 vote at the state level or 2 votes in the US senate) to getting this changed either via a state-level repeal or federal legislation codifying Roe.\n\nBasically, we can win this battle without being dishonest.",

That is the problematic part. Americans feel no sense of urgency about the term \"Christian fundamentalists\" because they are **not** taught to actively hate christian fundamentalism, like they are taught to hate the Taliban and Islamic fundamentalism. Why is that? Especially if both groups espouse the same regressive beliefs?  \n\nIt's for the same reason that white mass shooters are **not** labeled as thugs, but black gang members are, or even why white crime is not seen as dangerous as black crime. It's for the same reasons that athiests/satanists/pagans are seen as inherently immoral, while Christians/nonPagan-theists are automatically seen as inherently good and virtuous by sole virtue of believing in a popular god(s).  \n\nWhen we use certain \"identities\" and \"communities\" to represent the ***standard*** for a particular type of evil, this causes us to subconsciously associate all members of those particular identities/communities with that particular evil, AND it causes us to ignore and downplay other types of evil that represent immediate threats to us, but because these other types of evil don't share the same identity/community with the aforementioned \"standard evil group,\" they get away with their violent bullshit and we treat them as less of a threat, until oneday they suddenly become an uncontrollable problem that we are now forced to recognize as an immediate danger to our lives. \n\nThis leaves us trying to figure out how these monsters snuck up on us like this? They snuck up on us because our attention was firmly on the identities/communities that represent our standards of evil, thereby allowing the [non-standard] evil that lives right next to us to rise up and take over our country without us being aware. I call this the \"trojan horse of biased propaganda.\"  \n\nAsk yourself this. How is it that Americans have spent so much intellectual, economic, political, and legal resources trying to stop Islamic fundamentalism for 20 years, but instead ended up with a growing Christian theocratic/fascist America? Were Americans fighting religious fundamentalism in general for the past 20 years, or just **Islamic** fundamentalism? And if the latter, then why just the latter? And more importantly, did us focusing primarily on Islamic fundamentalism cause us to ignore the signs of a rising Christian nationalist movement in America? \n\nMy point is that, by using specific communities to represent a particular standard of evil, it allows other malevolent groups to swoop in while our collective attention is diverted elsewhere, to establish power for their own brand of evil. To avoid this, we can simply refuse to use specific identities/communities as representatives for a particular standard of evil, and instead focus exclusively on *demonizing* the \"evil\" itself, which allows us to equally recognize and stamp it out regardless of the identities/communities engaging in it. \n\nTo achieve this in the context of religious tyranny, we cannot only label religious fundamentalism as bad or dangerous when we can associate it with Islamic fundamentalism (which represents our BIASED standard for fundamentalist evil),  but instead we should label ALL forms of religious fundamentalism as inherently bad and dangerous regardless of whether or not it mimics the Taliban or Iran. \n\nThe decades long assumption that American Christian fundamentalism was not as bad as those \"Islamic extremists\" is exactly why christian nationalists were able to grow their power base under the radar with neither public awareness nor serious political resistance.",
