There isn't enough evidence to know what happened in those cases.\n\n> a man you\u2019re statistically more likely to be raped yourself than falsely accused.\n\nOn one hand, you are talking falsely accused to the police. Friend group, workplace, school, social media, etc accusations don't count as accusations but will still cause a lot of distress.\n\nOn the other hand you also ignore the fact that most raped men are raped by women and it isn't counted as rape.\n\nSo I think your statement is probably still correct but in bad faith on multiple fronts.",

You either don't know the background or just ignore it to hate men. Either way, you sound like a sexist moron to those of us who are educated on rape statistics.\n\n\nFor statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)\n\nShe is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the \"victims\" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely \"unwanted contact\"** \n\nYou see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g. \n\nDetecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206\n\n> > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**\n\nSrc: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf\n\nShe is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.\n\nMost people talking about sexual violence refer to the \"rape\" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for \"made to penetrate\" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.\n\nAs an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm\n\n> **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**\n\nand\n\n> The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\n\nvs\n\n> **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**\n\nand \n\n> Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators\n**For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),\n\nSo if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of \"made to penetrators\" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**\n\nBut since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. /r/science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs \"only\" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group \"nearly all the men were raped by other men\" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...\n\nAnd before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.\n\n\n2010 survey results - \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf\n\n2012 survey results -\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\n2015 survey results - \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf\n\nScientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known\n\n*data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*\n\nAnd non CDC study...\n\n*A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*\n\nThe Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/\n\nAnother non CDC study...\n\n*a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*\n\nAnd another non CDC study...\n\n*National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had \u2018ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,\u2019 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.\u201d*\n\nTime - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers\n\n*when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d\u2014either by physical force or due to intoxication\u2014at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*\n\n\nIf my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/\n\nJust maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at \"rapists\", rather than \"men\".\n\nAnd it isn't just the US.  \n\nFeminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms\n\nSo a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.\n\nIsraeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.\n\nhttps://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape\n\nNepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...\n\n> Women\u2019s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn\u2019t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims\u2019 fight for justice.\n\nhttps://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities\n\n**Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.\n\nhttp://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528\n\nSo women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.  That *should* matter *if* the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men",

Men created the patriarchy and the idea that men shouldn\u2019t express their emotions, which is why so many men lack a good support system and can\u2019t talk about their feelings, leading to depression. That\u2019s men\u2019s fault again, not women\u2019s. \n\nI am offended by rape jokes because they\u2019re disgusting.

It\u2019s not the same because there\u2019s a power imbalance",

Look at Table 2.1 and 2.2 on pages 18 and 19 respectively.\n\n[NISVS 2011](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/ss/ss6308.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.6% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 on page 5.\n\n[NISVS 2012](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 1.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.0% of women were raped. Look at Table A.1 and A.5 on pages 217 and 222 respectively.\n\n[NISVS 2015](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf) showed that in the past 12 months, 0.7% of men were made to penetrate and 1.2% of women were raped. Look at Table 1 and 2 on page 15 and 16 respectively\n\n\nVaries a bit from year to year, but pretty even overall. The numbers for perpetrators vary a little from year to year too. Something like 79-84% of made to penetrate (nonconsensual envelopment) victims are victimized  by women. Something like 96-99% of rape (nonconsensual penetration) victims are victimized by men. So in the 2010s, it averages out that a typical year has about 60% men and 40% women as perpetrators of nonconsensual sex outside prisons.\n\nAgain, in 2010s about equal victims and 60/40 perpetrator split between the sexes.",

In the UK, a woman can only legally rape if she assists a man in raping someone. Penetration by a penis is required for rape there.\n\nIf you stop minimizing sexual violence against men with the \"only\"'s you'd have a lot more allies to stop sexual violence.",

That brings cases like in India where porn addict 16 old girl raped her minor brother, she conceived, admitted that she raped him and the boy was sent to juvenile.\n\nOr the cases in Israel when mother rapes their son it is not recognized by law so they cannot persecute her properly.\n\nPretty much the same rape definition that CDC has is the same as in UK, so by law woman cannot be a rapist.\n\nIf you still don't believe that women are capable of sexual violence to this degree then there is still.\n\nHighest rate of domestic violence being in lesbian couples.\n\nSame sex sexual violence among inmates is 3 times higher in women prisons than men prisons.\n\nAnd I haven't seen s much about men's mental health, pretty much the only thing is the one video about men saying they have no one to turn to when they feel sad.\n\nAnd here is women's mental health\n\nhttps://wmhnv.org.au/news/8th-world-congress-on-womens-mental-health-in-paris-france-in-march/\n\nhttps://www.mhfaindia.com/index.php/news/celebrating-womens-mental-health-work-place\n\nAnd I think all that body positivity and health at every size is predominantly for women too.\n\nPlus like hey man had to make their own one. Why not make your own too. \nBut I think it would turn from women have mental health issues to patriarchy oppresive and all our issues are because of men really quickly.\n\nJust like you have all of that breast cancer awareness and marches and there is next to nothing about testicular cancer.",

The ones that has actual societal repercussions for us, like being far more likely to be raped/abused, looked over and dismissed constantly, never being listened to, always having to police your facial expressions, body language, tone etc to keep yourself safe from men and also even in our own homes, we\u2019re so accustomed to the male gaze and constantly being perceived that we can\u2019t even relax. What about the narrative of women as over emotional, when men are the ones who go on shooting sprees and punch holes in walls over an Xbox game and end up committing violence, mostly against women. What about the narrative that women are less intelligent and less competent than men, when the top two highest IQs in recorded history were both from women, women consistently outperform men in academia etc but our accomplishments are always dismissed and it\u2019s just societally assumed that men are better. Women are oppressed, that\u2019s a societal fact. The fact that that\u2019s even up for debate is ridiculous, like you are so accustomed to privilege that you are blind to women\u2019s experiences and are just so happy to not listen to the facts, and women telling you their experiences, and you just want to dismiss all of that and think that men are somehow the victims when they\u2019re not",
