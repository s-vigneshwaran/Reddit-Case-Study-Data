But it's not just regular sinking you see cuz we know about icebergs now but what I actually was happening is they were taking some ice samples in the North and an iceberg cracked and caused the tsunami that then pushed the iceberg into the new Titanic. \n\n\nLike I said it's an amazing movie and everybody should watch it literally prime cinematic shit.",

It entered service first.\n\nOn one of its test runs, she collided with a naval vessel and suffered slight damage. Or so White Star said at the time.\n\nThe theory is the damage was so much worse that the company decided it would be cheaper to switch the name plates on the two vessels and engineer the deep-sea sinking of *Olympic* as *Titanic*, then take in the insurance money. Thus, the theory goes, letting a coal fire burn on for a full week before the collision, weakening the hull next to it; sailing full steam into a known iceberg field, with the binoculars the lookout should have had locked away for reasons never explained, with all nearby ships conveniently owned by White Star. The ship sinking too deep to be examined at the time was the icing on that cake.\n\nAnd since then, the theory goes, there has been other evidence, like Ballard finding rooms in the ship that didn\u2019t match his floor plan.",

Britannic was the hospital ship but only her keel was laid out when Titanic sank and sadly she herself sank four years after Titanic after striking a magnetic sea mine. Her older sister Olympic was a troop ship and survived until the Great Depression. She is the ship often used in the switch theory because of the damage she suffered when colliding with a warship but contrary to the theorists she wasn\u2019t damaged that bad. A thing the conspiracy theorists don\u2019t seem to understand is that Titanic and Olympic were not identical and in fact Titanic was basically an upgraded design that switched up a lot of things like adding more rooms, extending popular areas, reducing less popular rooms, and added a few extra features for the crew like extended bridge wings for the crew to see better down the hull.",

Just a few of the problems:\n- Titanic and Olympic were sister ships but not identical. For one thing the Titanic had an extra deck enclosure that the Olympic did not and the last picture of the Titanic clearly shows an enclosed deck while the ship sailing as the Olympic after the disaster still had an open deck. Bit hard to explain that if the ships were switched. \n- The interiors were different. To pass off one as the other then they would have had to retrofit both ships. Sure, maybe they just built Titanic to look like Olympic inside (with none of the thousand of workers noticing?) but how\u2019d they make Olympic look like Titanic? She was busy sailing the whole time. \n- When did the switch happen? The two were only together twice, briefly both times, and the one of those times was when Titanic was still in her early steel skeleton phase of construction. Second time she was closer to finished but still not ready to sail. At the time Titanic launched on her maiden voyage, Olympic was returning from New York. \n- How was the collision arranged? They went south to avoid icebergs so how was \u201chit a burg\u201d their plan? If it was a bomb then why do we have so many eyewitnesses who can testify to seeing an iceberg and events proceeding exactly as they would have if, say, an iceberg scraped the side causing small but fatal openings along six watertight compartments?\n- She wasn\u2019t overinsured so the money gained from sinking wasn\u2019t worth the loss of a valuable ship let alone the blow it did to the White Star Line\u2019s reputation. \n\n\nAnd there\u2019s so much more. But \u201cthey switched ships for the insurance money\u201d is easy to say and feels a bit salacious so it\u2019s gained followers.",

But there's no record of him ever booking passage, and his publicized schedule pretty much precludes him ever intending to sail to America in April 1912, as he had business in France later in the month.",

                                      "text": "> Explain how Hershey and Morgan both suddenly said \"Nah in not going on the best trip ever\"\n\n1. As I already noted, there's no evidence Morgan was planning to be on the trip. He was unwell and had business in Europe at the end of April. It actually makes no sense that he would have sailed to New York mid-April, given his known schedule.\n\n2. Hershey canceled his trip because he decided to return to America earlier than he originally planned, as he had pressing business matters to attend to. This is not secret knowledge. Moreover, he originally booked his trip in mid-December 1911. This would have have to have been after the conspiracy was well underway, given the \"Titanic-Olympic swap\" nonsense must have been completed by early November of that year.\n\nAnd as for \"best trip ever,\" it wasn't like this was some earth-shattering marquee event. Maiden voyages for ocean liners were relatively common, and it's not like people booked passages on ships just for the purpose of experiencing such--the passengers on the Titanic were traveling for their own reasons, be it business, returning/embarking on vacations, emigration, etc. So no, there wasn't this idea of it being the \"best trip ever.\" Besides, the Titanic's maiden voyage was actually significantly less-celebrated than that of the Olympic's, which had occurred 10 months earlier.\n\nBeyond ALL of that, why would *Milton Hershey* have inside information about this alleged conspiracy and be involved in it? He owned a chocolate company. Yeah, he was really rich, but he was nowhere near the kind of rich of a Morgan, Rockefeller, or Carnegie, and had no known involvement in finance. The dude made candy bars!\n\n>And everyone knows that the Olympic crashed with a Military vessel.\n\nYes, and? This is known, and means nothing to the overall conspiracy being batshit crazy. It was an accident, and the Olympic was repaired. There's not a shred of evidence to say otherwise. And that has nothing to do with the fact that the Titanic (or \"Titanic\") was under-insured by $2.5 million, making the insurance scam notion ridiculous. Why would the White Star Line destroy its reputation as well as kill its own employees for basically $5 million, which was in no way going to make or break it, nor offset the costs associated with the disaster?\n\n>Like its more plausible there was insurance fraud and at the same time kill your whole competition.\n\nOnly if you don't know anything about anything, really. Especially how the ships were constructed and how it was quite literally physically impossible to have swapped the ships in the brief window they were together without everyone in the entire city of Belfast knowing exactly what was going on. \n\nAt the time of the alleged swap, the Titanic was nowhere near complete: only one of its four funnels had been installed, much of its upper decks were very unfinished, it was not painted. The Olympic arrived in early October for its repairs, and left less than four weeks later. So in four weeks they would have had to not only do 5 months worth of work to finish the Titanic and make it look like the Olympic, while simultaneously stripping down the Olympic--including removing funnels, lifeboats, deckhouses, interior fittings and furnishings, etc.--to make it look like a ship needing 4 more months to complete. \n\nNot only that, they would have to swap every single interior fitting from the Olympic: wall panels, staircase railings, wall lights, ceiling lights, kitchen machinery, and even the *propellers.* Why do we know they had to do this? Because all of these items were stamped with the unique yard number of each vessel. The Olympic's was 400, the Titanic's 401. These items were manufactured in advance and then installed from waiting warehouses into the ships. We're talking tens of thousands of items, big and small. So *if* the swap happened, that would mean either a) left those items in site, meaning you'd see 400 on the now-\"Titanic, and 401 on the now-\"Olympic,\" OR b) they swapped every single such item, a task that would require thousands of workers working round-the-clock, in full sight of the entire city of Belfast, right?\n\nSo hundreds of such items have been recovered from the bottom of the North Atlantic (or were recovered at the time of the sinking as floating debris), and guess what? Every. single. one. has 401 stamped on it, Titanic's yard number. Not a single 400 has ever been found. Meanwhile, hundreds of such items from the Olympic survive, too--they were auctioned off in 1935 when that vessel was sold for scrap. And every. single. one. has 400 stamped on it. What does that tell you? \n\nAs for \"killing the competition,\" who was this? Morgan's competition? Who on the Titanic was in any way a serious competitor to Morgan? As I already have said, nobody on the Titanic was in any way significant to the Fed creation issue, nor had any record of involvement with it. None of them were competitors to Morgan, and many of those who died *were technically his employees.* \n\nIt doesn't make any sense.",

Come on, this is a cheap and lazy argument tactic on your part, do better.\n\n> Why did J.P Morgan back out the last moment though?\n\nWhat actual evidence says that he did? \n\nI'll give you a hint: none. There's no actual evidence Morgan ever intended to be on the Titanic's voyage. There's *certainly* no evidence he was ever booked to sail on it, so therefore no evidence of \"backing out.\" \n\nMorgan was in Italy at the time convalescing at a spa due to ill health. He would die only a year later. It has been said he didn't make the voyage due to ill health. Well, that would seem reasonable and substantiated by his death a year later, wouldn't it? \n\nI'm not saying he ever intended to sail on the Titanic (again, there's no real evidence he ever did), but changing/canceling travel plans last-minute *was totally common* back then. Hell, rich people do that all the time to this day. There were many people who canceled plans to be on the Titanic at the last minute. There were many others who booked passage on it at the last minute. That was normal for all ocean liners of the era.\n\n>There is evidence of alot though \n\nWhere? Citations needed.\n\n>where is the clear evidence that the insurance company didnt clear the money for the Olympic?\n\nWhat is this supposed to mean? We're not talking about the Olympic's insurance, but the Titanic's, aren't we?\n\nThe Titanic was under-insured. The cost to build her was $7.5 million, but she was only insured for $5 million. Furthermore, a chunk of that insurance coverage was via the International Mercantile Marine, the parent company of the White Star Line. So some of that coverage was basically being self-insured.\n\nSo yeah, she was underinsured by $2.5 million, at least. How is that \"insane?\"\n\nI'll also add this from another comment I made: the cost to the White Star Line's reputation for having it newest, grandest and largest ship (which had garnered a reputation as being unsinkable) sink in mid-ocean would be obviously devastating for the company, especially since they heavily promoted the safety of the vessel. I can't imagine in what universe anyone would think concocting an elaborate scheme to deliberately sink their flagship would somehow be worth a relatively meager insurance payout.\n\nNot to mention: if they wanted to get the insurance money for the Olympic, they could have just, I don't know, burned it in port. Fires aboard ships were relatively common then, and the forensic ability to detect arson very, very limited.",

The three Olympic sisters were close enough that whichever one had \"Titanic\" painted on it *was* the Titanic for all intents and purposes. Likely not many people other than the engineers and builders could tell the three apart at a glance. It's also not really important cause the Britannic also met a sad end. Olympic was the only one of the three that was retired and scrapped at the end of her career.\n\nEven if that's the case though, that Olympic was supposed to be Titanic? It doesn't matter, it's Olympic because that's what it says on the ship, and the paperwork. That's a conspiracy theory just to be a contrarian and conspiracy theorist. There's literally nothing there.\n\nMan, did this feel good to write, even if it doesn't make sense. The catharsis was nice. Sometimes a good rant sorts me out real nice.",

You can clearly see who would benefit, each step in the process is achievable, and keeping it mostly secret would just take replacing the current construction teams and telling the new team they're working on the other ship.\n\nIt is basically insurance fraud at a time where the British Empire was ok with letting Ireland stave, and UK companies were sending children down mines, and into machinery where they were mutilated regularly.

As it hadn't left the \"factory\"  the companies insurance wouldn't cover it. The company was facing bankruptcy if it could be fixed. Amazingly, the Olympic was fixed, and set sail for many years.\n\nIt wasn't during construction.  It had a collision with another ship.  I think it was a Royal Navy ship on the English channel.  That damage was said to have severely damaged it by breaking the ships 'spine'.  Which wouldn't have been an economical repair.\n\nIt was ruled that the Olympic was at fault so the insurance wouldn't pay out.  So the Shipping company suddenly have an almost new ship that is written off.  Scrapping it would have lost them a fortune bankrupting the company.\n\nSo with the Titanic still in dock in Belfast.  The Olympic returned beside her for repairs and upgrades which would bring her closer to Titanic spec.  Again if I remember right it was upgrades to the passenger deck on the bow to reduce spray.\n\nThe conspiracy theory is with the two ships side by side in dock, the broken Olympic conveniently getting upgrades to Titanic spec making them almost indistinguishable from the outside by the casual watcher.   The two ships were swapped making the broken Olympic the Titanic and a plan was hatched to sink the broken ship and collect the insurance. A plan that supposedly went wrong because Titanic (Olympic) was on a slightly wrong course putting the rescue ships further away than they were supposed to be.\n\nOne of the things that supposedly gives credence to the theory is that the ship on the Atlantic sea bed has a propeller with a serial number that was supposed to be on Olympic. But then they could have been swapped in dry dock if Titanic's wasn't ready and Olympic obviously wasn't using hers in dock.Then of course the supposedly broken Olympic sailed for some time afterwards before being scrapped. Which if the damage was as bad as it was supposed to be, wouldn't have happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh edit to add because I forgot. \n\nSome people think the Titanic breaking in two is evidence of the previous accident.

          "text": "It's about a theory, that the sinking of the titanic was a scheme to not only kill off 3 very rich dudes who protested against the federal reserve bank but also to collect the insurence money. This theory originated because there are several fishy things about the sinking of the Titanic, since the higher ups of the crew fled before everyone else had a chance, the captain was informed that they would hit an iceberg before hitting it but he deliberately didn't steer in a different direction because he thought his ship was indestructable and because the one who built this ship canceled his own voyage on this ship last minute. To add to this, the Titanic was not found for a very long time, so naturally people started to suspect that the ship simply wasn't there anymore and that it was one big conspiracy. There is also one story about a boat of passengers being found, who were killed with headshots, but this has never been fully confirmed, leaving some people to believe that this was a hoax and others to say that they were knew they wouldn't make it and one shot the others before drowning himself.\n\n\nAnd yes, a few people actually think that the Titanic never existed and some even say that it never sunk. It is a true rabbit hole to investigate this shit. I personally think, that it was indeed an insurance scam, since the ship was way more profitable after it sank rather than before and there is a lot of evidence that suggests that the Titanic was built with faulty material to cut costs, that were later on masked as the proper materials. I truly think that this was more a case of \"it will definitly sink at one point or another\" rather than a planned sinking of the Titanic on its maiden voyage. I mean, lets be honest, telling a captain known for his recklesness his ship is unsinkable is kinda weird, especially when you know for a fact that it was not as perfectly well constructed as it was advertised to be.",

This was a feature of the titanic, but not a feature of the olympic which was almost identical in every other way.   \n\n\nI'd say 50/50 that it happened, we won't really know until submersibles inspect the titanic's hull in detail - but that's not likely to happen before it decays.",

                  "text": ">  a) was the sinking of the Titanic a particularly well-known disaster before the movie came out?\n\nAssuming you mean the **1997** film, um, yes? It was easily the most famous shipwreck, long before Cameron's feature. It was a huge media event when it sank in 1912, and became a cultural icon quickly after that. Numerous films were made about it (the first a mere year later, AND starring an actual survivor, Dorothy Gibson), countless books, poems, songs, plays, etc. Phrases such as \"the band playing on,\" \"rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic,\" and such became part of the common lexicon.\n\n>b) Why?\n\nBecause it had all the elements of a gripping melodrama: The largest, must luxurious ship ever build is touted as being a marvel of modern engineering and gains a reputation for being \"unsinkable,\" but on its maiden voyage while loaded with a bevy of famous social elites of the era it hits an iceberg in the middle of the night and sinks, with enormous and appalling loss of life. And it didn't just sink, it sank over nearly three hours, allowing for lots of vivid moments of drama to be related by survivors: the band playing music to keep people calm; the wealthy men seeing their women and children into lifeboats and then stepping back to meet their dooms, since there were only enough lifeboats for a fraction of those on board; the crew valiantly and calmly keeping order and seeing the boats away; the poor Third Class passengers being stuck below decks, a building panic among them as the situation becomes more dire; the final terrible plunge of the vessel, it's stern swinging high into the air...\n\nI'd recommend the book \"Down With the Old Canoe,\" which is a cultural history of the Titanic disaster and its place in popular sentiments after it occurred. It gives some very good accounts as to why it became a cultural phenomenon. It became THE symbolic event of the era, where anyone with an ideological axe to grind could find a way to use it to support their views: \"Look at how it shows the nobility of rich men, who sacrificed themselves for others!\" \"Look at how it shows the greed and cravenness of rich men, who had access to the boats for their families while poor people were left for dead!\" And countless other pet issues.\n\n>There\u2019s been more deadly maritime disasters since then, and I doubt the Titanic was the first massive civilian disaster at sea.\n\nTo this day, the Titanic disaster remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of a ocean liner (or cruise ship) in history. Prior to the Titanic, there had been some significant shipwrecks, of course. But it exceeded the closest death toll by almost double. The loss of the Titanic prompted enormous changes to maritime safety regulations: carrying enough lifeboats for everyone on board; mandated 24-hour wireless radio vigils; the establishing of the International Ice Patrol to monitor bergs, etc. \n\nSo yeah, there are pretty good reasons why the Titanic achieved its place in culture as it did. And so of course it spawns silly conspiracy theories: pretty much any significant event will attract the loons.",

The theory of the time was that another ship would be close enough to take on the passengers and then send the boats back to be refilled before the ship sank. And that would have panned out fine if the Californian had responded. \n\nThe radio operator told Titanic to shut up because radios of the time were louder the closer together they were, and their radios were configured for extremely long range communication. Titanic was blasting the airwaves nonstop with noise, so the Californian\u2019s radio operator told them to shut up and then went to bed.

This one simple fact is 100% incompatible with anything other than the earth being spherical. This would not happen\u2026at all\u2026with a flat geometry on earth - only a curved one. \n\nThis is actually how Erastothenes proved the Earth was spherical over 2,000 years ago - he just couldn\u2019t travel far, so he used poles and the angles of shadows cast by the sun to show the curvature of the Earth. Same concept as what I just said, except in reverse and it requires some math. His method showed the difference in shadows cast on earth with a change in latitude, while observing the moon shows the difference in angles of the shadow cast on the moon based on its orbital position around the earth and a change in latitude on the earth. \n\nBut no actual calculation is necessary to do this with the moon. All you need to do is look up.\n\nEDIT: What I am describing should be fairly obvious, but in case anyone needs a visual aid, here you go:\n\nhttps://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moon_phases_by_latitude.svg",

Majority of flat earthers live in the northern hemisphere so they don't see the effects in astronomy down in the southern hemisphere. However on the flat earth model, the moon is also small and close to the earth, the same as the sun. So theoretically, the farther south you travel, the more you'll see the shadow change on the moon. I'm not 100% sure where the moon is supposed to be, so I can't answer too much about it. The big hole in their theory though is how the moon can go through the waxing/waning phases in the first place. If you live under the path of the moon then it should be half shadowed permanently throughout the year. The sun will always be shining on it, so you'll always see half the moon when viewing it from below.\n\nSomething that I have yet to get an explanation on though are meteorites. How can rocks just fall out of the sky?\n\nAnother is how the stars all rotate around a single point in the sky when you look at them in the southern hemisphere. Or how if you stand at the equator, they all travel in a line.",

No matter where you are or how close the moon is to Earth, you are still equidistant to the moon at all times when the Earth is flat. This is pretty simple to prove geometrically. The angle of the shadow will never change in the same way that it does on an Earth with curvature. The *only* way that you could get a slightly similar effect is if the moon orbited close, and was minuscule in size compared to what it actually is, but even then it wouldn\u2019t cause the shadows to change orientation in the same way that they actually do with latitude. Take a look at that image I linked, and try to think of how the appearance of the moon from the North to South Pole is possible when you are equidistant from the moon at all times, even if the moon is small and orbiting close. It isn\u2019t possible. It is literally geometrically impossible. Like I said, Erastothenes proved the Earth was not flat over 2,000 years ago using basically this same concept, except via shadows on the earth.\n\nEdit: And to be clear (although I don\u2019t think I need to clarify this\u2026), what I mean is that there is no mathematical way that you can account for the change in lunar phase angle with latitude with a flat earth geometry. You can get changes in angle depending on perspective and size/closeness of the moon, which I think was your point, but it will *never* match what is actually observed with actual latitude changes. There will be a mismatch. The same thing is true if one were to model Erastothenes\u2019 experiment in a flat Earth model if the sun was close to earth and small - you can get changes in the angle of the shadow, but it will not match what is actually observed with latitude on a spherical earth. And there is no mathematical way to make it match.",

Trust me, I've spent ages debating with them trying to explain all the ways the flat earth model doesn't work.\n\nTake the seasons for example. They believe that the sun moves in a spiral getting closer north during summer and then away in the winter. Only possible on their model because the sun is so close to the earth.

But I bring it up because 1) I've heard people actually try and argue that, and 2) You see shades of it even from scientifically-minded people, which I find strange. It shows up in the \"anthropic principle,\" which was kind of pioneered in high-energy physics but seems to have crept into other fields - it answers questions like \"Why are the values of the parameters of the Standard Model of particle physics what they are?\" by saying \"They are what they are because if they were something different, humans wouldn't be around to ask that question.\" It's an appealing idea that strikes many people, including myself at first, as a very clever and elegant way of resolving those questions... Which it is, but it's not a scientific answer. So I guess this is my friendly reminder that trained, professional scientists are also susceptible to lapses in scientific thinking!",

Every airline. In every country on the entire planet. And despite that meaning that multiple manufacturers of airplanes, many many airlines, hundreds of thousands of people who build the airplanes, maintain them, fly them (the weight of the equipment and chemicals would have to be accommodated for in every takeoff and landing), attend aircraft emergencies, load and unload the chemicals and equipment and maintain the sprayers, AND every airline regulatory agency on the entire planet AND every air crash investigator on the entire planet would have to be in on and keeping the secret. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people all keeping this secret hush-hush. But they know about it because they know the right place to look on the internet for the real \"truth\". \n\nI always wonder if these people have ever tried to get a group of people to agree on a restaurant for dinner.

That person gets to leave the line and walk up and down it and pick whoever is being \"best.\"  Then they retake their spot and the person they picked goes next.  Everyone only gets picked once.  You can't \"lose\" this version because that just means you get picked last.\n\nIt's really nifty as a teacher because it not only means all the kids are doing their best to be good and quiet, but they are also paying attention so they can see who has been picked and who hasn't, which means they are alert for my signal that it's time for the class to move.\n\nAs a sub, it really is my favorite game.",

But even in first grade they aren't exactly teaching about the Titanic, the moon landing, dinosaurs, or geography. They might see those things in passing, such as a dinosaur to help make the material interesting, but it all likelihood the kids would have seen a dinosaur like that before (such as in a coloring book or cartoon).\n\nThe tweet from the OP is so idiotic that I can only hope that it's a joke. But with their inability to distinguish \"in to\" and \"into\", I'm guessing they're just *that dumb* and never stepped foot into a school so they don't know what the experience is like.",

Getting a compliment from a girl at a show, sometimes there's an extra glance at each other here or there through crowds to make sure we're safe. The hard-core but safely consensual and hidden in private sex scenes are very colorful as well. And it's funny because the more I see conservatives wrongfully judge this, the more we sort of get this secret badge that helps us know our allies. (Obviously it's more than just hair color, it's mannerisms and convos sparked from it that just imply you're speaking to a decent human who won't kill you for being different. And that's something special to me.)",

Both are party focused. What you describe is Anarcho capitalism which would derive power purely from control of financial means.\n\nAgain most of these anarcho capitalists and libertarian conspiracy theorists would not agree with your statements. They literally just want to be left alone, they are often hermits even in suburban environments and if they got the government they wanted their interactions with other people might be the occasional purchase of needed goods. They are also too dumb to understand that those corporations will just be private governments, youre right in that is what will happen under libertarian or anarcho capitalists forms of government but that's not what they *want* they are just too dumb to understand that's what will happen.

The classic example of this is anarcho-capitalism which is a form of libertarianism that developed from American libertarianism which is a reaction against classical liberalism which is a left wing political ideology. Traditional anarchism is very much anti-capitalist whereas Anarcho capitalists are very much pro-capitalist, positioning them right of center relative to the left leaning anarchists who would catatonically reject the idea of capitalism within an anarchist structure.",

They definitely do believe in conspiracies - the crimes Trump's accused of, Epstein didn't kill himself, Facebook's political agenda etc. But they consider 'conspiracy theorists' to be a separate entity, and thus the moniker is laden with all kinds of negative connotations that shut down any discussion. Really, everybody's a conspiracy theorist to some degree, but I think the us VS them mentality that's grown around the term is harmful to everybody. \n\n\nI'd consider myself a conspiracy theorist - some theories I genuinely believe, some things I just like to look into for fun, but I'm not a conservative and I wouldn't have voted for Trump if I were an American. I agree that some conspiracy theories have done serious harm, but if we tar everyone with the same brush, we're doing a disservice to critical thinking, and ultimately to ourselves. \n\nThe 9/11 theories that you acknowledge aren't genuinely harmful, for example, are subject to a fairly recent form of censorship that seems to have flown under the radar. There used to be a plethora of different theories readily accessible on youtube, but if you search for them now, you'll meet a wall of videos debunking said conspiracy theories, and an excerpt from the Wikipedia article reaffirming the official story. The theories themselves are hard to find. I understand that this is a result of the crackdown on QAnon and covid deniers on youtube - something had to be done to prevent harm - but where is the direct harm of questioning 9/11? I don't think there is one. Censorship creeps in unchallenged, and it's supported by something as simple as a linguistic bias against conspiracy theories in all forms. Of course we all know what we mean when we deride 'conspiracy theories'; of course we all have an idea in our heads of what is 'obviously dumb and harmful', and what is OK. Nonetheless the environment has been created where questioning things at all seems to automatically align you with a load of beliefs that you don't necessarily share.",

No secret agency can be, exactly because of that secrecy. Without transparency, you cannot trust any organisation, government or otherwise. And because of that, the extent to which they're supporting or not supporting conspiracy theories like covid denial could be argued any which way you might be inclined.",

It's fucked up that this is true and you can easily pick apart the logic they try to teach, but the fact remains that they are teaching it and practicing it.\n\n If you grew up in a faith that didn't teach circumcision as a necessary practice in keeping with god's covenant with abraham, good for you. I'm glad you grew up in a community that was at least one step closer to reality.\n\nIf you're telling me that it shouldn't be this way, you're right and I agree with you because it is fucked.

Nobody on the Titanic was of any importance to the issue of the Fed's creation. None are on record expressing opposition to the creation of the Fed, while one of the wealthiest men on board (Straus) was quoted in a 1910 New York Times article as enthusiastically supporting it.\n\nBy April 1912, the formation of the Federal Reserve was basically a *fait accompli.* It was widely supported, and ended up passing Congress by a pretty comfortable margin.",

But curriculum is public and you can see what is being taught.\n\nThat said, I hate when people say this as if it is still happening.\n\nIn 2001, the No Child Left Behind Act was signed by Bush, and it ushered in an era of curriculum that was rote memorization to pass benchmarks . . . there was almost no critical thinking done then, until 2010 when Common Core was implemented.\n\nBut for 8 years, the damage was done. Think about a 4th or 5th grader getting NCLBA curriculum and then graduating high school 2009-2010 and being met with the dawn of social media.\n\nFacebook is really ramping up in 2009/2010, as is Tumblr and Twitter and all the rest.\n\nNow, you have adults who, you are right, weren't taught critical thinking engaging in and reading Facebook and FoxNews (and making statements about our education system without any qualifications to do so).\n\nAnd that's where we're at now.\n\nLuckily, since 2010, Common Core in many states is doing good work, but the misinformation cycle, and social media, is doing a lot of harm.",

Well to begin, you will lose karma on your account, which is a useful social status tool and also a way to show others you know your way around Reddit.\n\nIf you were to continue the use of emojis, I would be forced to privately message you about your slip-up. Any further offenses past that would leave me no other option than to report your account. I don\u2019t think I have to explain why you don\u2019t want that.\n\nBut anyways, no harm done yet!

Children aren\u2019t scared of the sun? Just cuz ppl think things are scary doesn\u2019t mean they actually are. Idk I\u2019m rambling I\u2019m just sick of this dumb shit",

Weird times.\n\nThe underlying thing to understand about this though is that the people insisting on \"alternative facts\" do so from a place of wanting to be proprietors of information/truth. Objective reality existing outside of their consent is unacceptable so they push for all things to be made subjective,  interpretive and speculative.

I tolerate it and let my 5 year old son know that it is his choice. I cannot make him denounce god just as I cannot make him obey god. I will absolutely have realistic conversation with him when he is ready, about how to discern what is real vs. what isn\u2019t. And at the end of that conversation my answer will remain the same. believe or don\u2019t believe; it is his choice. But indoctrination of children so young is disgusting. They don\u2019t have the mental capabilities of questioning what an adult tells them. I concede that religion has played an important role (both good and bad) throughout history, but it\u2019s gotten out of hand. \nAnd guess what?!?

Also I didn't see anything about hormones blockers in that link. \n\nMy  take away is, why doesn't she feel comfortable coming to her parents about this? its an entirely circular situation. Just think about it: transphobic parents have their children scared to come to them, so they go to another authority figure, to get help with their strife, and then the parents use that as a slight against the school. \n\n\nWhen i was in i-care back in highschool for depression, they told my dad all the shit i said about his alcoholism and that created more problems for me at home. The only difference here is the involvement of gender. As if certain parents dont disown and mistreat their gay children- its cultural norm.",

Schools and teachers helping students deal with internal strife has always been the case.\n\n I mean when i was growing up, we never had an entire lesson plan about gender (do you have an article stating that happens now? sex ed doesn't count), but when a student is dealing with an issue such as that, maybe it'll be helpful to have support?? But many call that grooming, which is kinda fucked.\n\n Kids are in for what, 8hrs a day? Am i supposed expect them to not build up a level of trust with an educator, that can help make their situation easier to bear? That's how school worked for me up until i graduated, we could go up to teachers and talk to them about our problems, but when its gender, its an issue?\n\nThe only \"harm\" that took place in that article was they called her by her new pronouns. I do not care. Sincerely. You'd have a point if the school was telling her she was trans, but she told THEM that. \n\nDon't you think its weird that children are scared to confront these things with their parents? Shouldn't we also look into that? Again, its basically a cultural norm that trans/homophobic parents disown and abuse their children ... Please address.",

I don't believe this narrative, ik early on i was straight, first intimate interaction was in kindergarten. I dont believe you can be confused into being a different gender unless you're straight up being raped and abused. \n\nBut you know what is confusing? Being forced to live up to heteronormative standards and every time you fall short, you're berated by parents and peers. Us boys in elementary school were scared to admit we watched powerpuff girls for this reason. My entire generation is called feminine because we have tight pants now, you don't see how asinine that shit is? \n\nSurgery is done @18. But im sure you have an article with an outlier? Why would you want puberty blockers after all those years of puberty already affecting your body? defeats the purpose. Again nobody knows the long term effects, but they want it, they say it helps, if they make it to that stage after the years of psychological analysis, then its their cross to bear.

The issue was how it changed the environment by throwing massive amounts of dust and debris up into the air, which blocked sunlight for most plants, which heavily limited food availability for animals. Any animals with adaptions that would allow them to survive this situation mostly did survive, such as crocs and birds. Crocs are cold blooded and can go long periods without needing to eat, and birds are smarter, more mobile, and are able to eat a large variety of things to sustain themselves. Non-avian dinosaurs just weren\u2019t able to survive those conditions. Also, the thing about humans and Dinosaurs coexisting is technically completely true since birds are classified as dinosaurs",
