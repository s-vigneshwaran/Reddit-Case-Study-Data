Trump is a symptom of the problem, not the problem itself.\n\nThe problem is two-fold:\n\nFirst, and primarily, that the Republicans have gone to fascism to stay in power and serve their oligarch powermakers.\n\nSecond, and important but definitely as much as an order of magnitude less important, is what I would summarize as Citizen's United. Basically, corporations and the wealthy used to be limited in the financial support they could provide to politicians, so politicians had to go to We the People to raise money. Now that is no longer true. Why does your voice not matter? Because you can't put enough money where your mouth is to be heard, unlike the ultra rich oligarchs.",

What set the stage was the gradual process of Republicans becoming fascist - from Reagan (and before, but he was basically a watershed event in the progression) of Fox News starting up as the Republican propaganda outlet to the abuses of the reaction to 9/11 (Patriot Act, etc) and to the escalation of rhetoric and \"the party of no\" when Obama was elected. \n\nTrump is not who the Republicans and their oligarchs want - he's too much. Case in point, people woke up to him and now there's backlash. Republicans want a president who mostly slips under the radar. Like Dubya, who played the character of \"I'm just a country guy you'd have a beer with\". That didn't scare people like Trump, even though he caused\u2026 well, not as much harm as Trump, but a HELL of a lot more harm than more people paid attention to.\n\nSo comments like yours worry me. We're about to have Republicans with even more power, meaning they stop most legislation. Which means people not paying attention will be back even more than they already are to saying \"Democrats can't get anything done!\" and not vote, meaning we're likely to have a Republican in 2024. And they'll be smart. Back to someone not like Trump, and people will go to sleep again, and we'll continue to lose basic human rights.\n\nSo it's not that Trump wasn't horrific - he was. It's that he's not anywhere near to being the actual problem, merely a fluke extra-bad effect that actually harmed Republican plans to destroy our democracy. To focus on Trump as the problem is to be asleep to our loss of democracy.\n\nIdeally, we need to get corporate/oligarch money out of politics again, repair the Democrats, disband the Republicans for their near successful attempt to destroy us\u2026 although I don't know how we go about fixing the half of the nation that believes lies.\n\nBasically, we're fucked. So much harder than Trump fucked us.",

Just consider that a huge percentage of people (around the world) still believe, that selecting an incompetent actor was a great idea, and that he did well, although all the evidence argues against such a conclusion.\n\nThat actor was treasons by supplying the enemy with weapons, and agreeing to demands by terrorists fuelling terror against the US.\n\nCognitive dissonance and wilful ignorance are hugely underrated phenomena.",

They don't like to feel stupid so they decided let's elect one of us , someone so fucking dumb that we will understand their elementary school level sentences. It also worked quite fine for all the racist pieces of shit who were more than happy to openly be racist pieces of shit like \"the good old days\" \n\nBasically it worked for all the worst people in our country not the majority of us. \nWe all knew it was gonna be bad prior to him getting elected and unfortunately had to watch as he attempted to do a fascist takeover of the entire government. Fortunately he lost but I'm really really hoping he gets a federal fucking charge for the whole espionage thing and we get to see him in handcuffs or an orange jumpsuit ( would probably go well with his spray tan skin ) \nHe needs to be embarrassed and those who fucking helped him commit treasonous acts need to be removed from their positions and charged as well. We need to weed out the fucking fascists now or things may be worse in just a few years.",
