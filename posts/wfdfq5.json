  "text": "The Catholic Church donated over 3 million trying to limit abortion access in Kansas. Funny how the church has millions for political campaigns but attempts to avoid paying victims of sex abuse. If a church is going to spend millions on politics, it\u2019s time to tax the hell out of the Catholic Church.\nhttps://amp.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article263915311.html\n\nFunny how the church has all this money to donate to a political campaign while the same church tries to avoid paying victims of sex abuse. \n\nThe Catholic Church needs to be taxed if they are going to blatantly engage in political campaigns.",

Nauman of the Archdiocese of Kansas City Kansas and Cardinal Cupich of Chicago.\n\nNauman was the safe, conservative candidate, just towing the line as it always has been.  Cupich is a left-winger, raised through the ranks by Pope Francis.  He wanted to expand pro-life to include not just abortion but also immigration, care for the poor, education, care for the elderly, etc.\n\nNauman won.  I am surprised more than $3 million wasn't spent under his directives.  He'll approve far more *next* time.",

The guy decided to \"do the right thing\" and asked her parents for her hand in marriage. They said yes, he divorced his wife and married the girl. 9 months after she graduated, they had their first of 3 kids. No uproar either, the only uncommon part was that he was her teacher. \n\nTo *my* Western 21st century morals all of this shit is disgusting, but morality differs across time and location. We used to settle arguments \"like men\" and just shoot at each other not that long ago too. Slavery used to be a-ok in the west a few generations back (or even today depending on who you ask). Circumcision is commonly viewed as the default here in the US, but cruel mutilation in most of the world (and to me).",

Plus, I would speculate that there is a potential freedom of speech issue if the IRS were to try to fully enforce the rule. \n\nI would add that just because a church has an unpopular opinion and takes the maximum advantage of their legal position, does not necessarily mean that they deserve punishment. They may behave crappy but if they are operating the law, they shouldn\u2019t be punished. Now if we as a society through our elected representatives choose to change the tax status of churches, that is fine. However, I\u2019m not a fan of punitive punishment when the law is not broken. This is not a defense of churches but just a general position.",

If they disagreed, the doctor could be charged with all manner of crime, including terrorism, anyone who helped transport the pregnant person would be transporting them in order to commit a felony or misdemeanor, and get locked up for that.

This legislation removed or extended the civil SOL so survivors can gain justice and expose the identities of hidden pedophiles in the state of Georgia.

It narrowly failed to pass on the last day of the 2018 legislative session.[16][17][18]\"\n\nWHY IS THIS ORGANIZATION NOT CHARGED AS A CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION?\n\nI just feel like throwing up every time I see them using lobbyists and lawyers.\n\nThey are taking tax dollars and church goers money to protect their pedophiles, which is still continuing to happen.",

The person who chairs the committee the bill has been assigned to is state Sen. Kellie Warren, a Catholic. Additionally, the lobbyist for the Kansas Catholic Conference has voiced concern regarding the \u201cimpact\u201d on the church if it should pass. My bill \u2014 S.B. 420, which would help dozens of survivors of childhood sexual violence pursue justice \u2014 has never been granted a hearing.  \nCoincidence?

I think you're maybe missing my point. Poverty is and always will be apart of the human condition. Even as we uplift the poor they're still going to be poor realitive to the rich. In a Christian context this was never an excuse to ignore those suffering in poverty and we should do everything to help those people, but I don't believe man is going to eradicate all Poverty from this earth.

The church also Said LGBT agenda is being forces on people, but I guess it doesn't work that way when the church forces their agenda on us. \n\nI was a victim of the r word, and I had to get an abortion because the child was probably going to end up damaging me since I was underage. But it's okay. They don't care about the current generation, they only care about how many seeds a man can sow. And supporting the church is like endorsing the idea that even criminals deserve to have their child put out there when a woman or whatever doesn't even want it in the first place. \n\nThere are literally 7 churches within my walking distance alone, and one big super church that looks like a gamer stadium. Yet around those churches it's very much poverty line. When will people start seeing that religion doesn't belong anywhere near mass politics.",

I'm not saying I agree with the catholic church, but a church donating money to protecting the life of innocent children isn't a \"political campaign,\" as you put it. That's just the kinda thing that is the reason they don't pay taxes. Because they run homeless shelters, orphanages, soup kitchens, etc., traditionally. Sure, there's ones like Scientology that just abuse the tax free status. But churches aren't just molestation mills, like you all like to pretend. Most of them, yes, even Catholics, are trying to help people. Sure, there's fuckwads in there, but those are in any group of people. You can't group people together without mixing in a few pieces of shit by accident. But it appalls me that people can just write abortion off as a religious prejudice on a political issue. It's a moral prejudice of a moral issue. It's wrong to kill people, of any age. And it doesn't have to say that in a religion for it to be true. But you tie them together because it's the only defense. I'm definitely not a catholic and I applaud their support for doing the right thing. Non-religious people can think it's wrong, too.",

Why it's impossible to tax the church is because you wouldn't just be taxing your countries followers of the faith, but you would be taxing other nation folk for their faith as well. Sure you can get into the nit and gritty of taxing specific to the members of the church in your nation, but who is documenting everytime someone enters a church? The issue with that is the only way to make a tax law that isn't directly discriminatory, would be to make religion beucratic and documented, which in the end does put a strain on to people's right to religion.",

Most non-profit organizations are required to keep open books, to refrain from electioneering or political lobbying, to avoid embezzling money for unrelated purposes, and so on. Churches are either exempt from any such requirements, or know full well that they will never be enforced. In addition, churches (and in some states, only christian churches, or even only protestant christian churches) are entitled to *extra* handouts and tax exemptions that no one else can get.\n\nWe're not proposing creating a special \"Church Tax\" (there are numerous arguments why such a thing should be implemented one day, but hey, baby steps). We are talking only about making churches play by the same rules as everyone else. Many small community churches could still qualify as \"non-profit organizations\", but if they wish to qualify, let them fill out the same paperwork, accept the same responsibility, and jump through the same hoops as everyone else. Meanwhile, enormous stadium-megachurches whose rockstar pastors pay themselves seven figure salaries can be classified for what they really are, as can multinational corporations/criminal syndicates like the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nMaking churches play by the same rules as everyone else is very nearly word-for-word what the Constitution already says about the issue: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof[.]\"",
