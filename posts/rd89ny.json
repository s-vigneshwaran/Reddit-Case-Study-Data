That link leads to a link about an example in a group called Identity Evropa, \n\nwhich sent me to one of the digital figure heads of these types of movements named Eli Mosley, \n\nwhich sent me down another line of people in the current Alt Right movement claiming to have come to their \"racist awakening for lack of a better term\" through killing Muslims with the military.\n\nLike, you'd think even idiots would stop making the same mistake after getting hammered with the fact that their service records are publicly available. These people are pathetic. I served a long time in service. And I've always thought it was really weird how ALL of these people were coming from a military background, since from my experience the service has been the least fucking racist place I've ever lived. It's good to see that so many of these people have been full of shit and I'm not crazy.\n\nSo basically all these popup alt right groups basically just haul ass to college campuses, tailor their message so it doesn't sound really all that crazy, draw people in, and then convince them that they're in danger of, hold on let me check, diversity I guess I dunno. And then from there they continue getting them all hyped up for an issue that doesn't really exist. Then when that isn't working, they make up some fictional anti-white villain and pretend to be them on twitter and Facebook because none of the real life \"bad guys\" are doing anything bad.\n\nSo they make a fake backstory about how they didn't start off racist, someone else made them that way.\n\nThey prey on our young before they're able to get those good \"Oh, these people are fucking nuts\" life experience under their belt.\n\nThey make up their own villains to further their cause because without them there's just no justification.\n\nAnd then when they get found out they just kind of try and stop talking to the person calling them out.\n\nSo ya, it seems to be a pretty consistent thing.",

Reminds me of this quote\n\n>Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly, since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.\n\n>It is not that they are afraid of being convinced. They fear only to appear ridiculous or to prejudice by their embarrassment their hope of winning over some third person to their side.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre, 1946",

Not one black person had the power to make and break treaties with Native Americans. Black people did not come over to take your land and wipe you off the face of the Earth. But you really going to try and convince us that oppressed black people have oppressed Native Americans more than white people, who literally stole your land. Since th beginning of this country white people have held the power and made the laws to oppress all people. Again racism is prejudice plus power, that is why racism is attributed to white people exclusively. Now anybody can be prejudice. But racism is the act of actually creating laws and institutions to elevate one race over another. So please tell me when black people have had the power to create laws and institutions to elevate black people over white and Native Americans.

America is more right when it comes to healthcare, but also way more accepting of immigrants than other democracies. European right wingers like healthcare, but that doesn't make them not right wing.

Too many Americans view Europe as more left than it is and assume all of Europe is like Scandinavia.",

There were IIRC 32 people who were indicted for it including his lawyer and campaign manager. They actually went to prison. And no, it wasn't just for tax things they had done in the past. Part of the charge was for them and Russia. \n\nThe only problem with Trump in the whole thing is that once Muller did his investigation and handed it off to the department of defence.... Who then did nothing with it.\n\nSome people point to him being innocent because nothing happened. But that's not really how it works. \n\nImagine if your neighbor broke into your house and stole some of your possessions. You have evidence that indicates he might have been the one who did it. So you bring it to a detective, and he just puts it to the side... and that's it. He doesn't do anything with it. As far as you know he never even looked at it. Since he didn't get areeste, he's innocent. He gets to go free. Right? \n\nWell, no. It just means they never took it to court. He was never found innocent not guilty. It's just there. You may know he did it, or at least see a ton of stuff that makes you think they are. Yet there will be people who will say that this is proof they are innocent. I mean, why aren't they in prison? \n\nRight now, that's how a lot of people feel about Trump. The fact that the people around him are guilty, and they all worked for him seems a bit suspect. Not to mention things like his relationship with Putin. Has it been proven in court? No. \n\nBut neither was Epstein either. Would you say he was innocent?\n\nHow about OJ? He actually has a lot of people who think he was innocent.\n\nOr there's the story of [Coca Cola having death squads in Columbia.](https://wsarch.ucr.edu/wsnmail/2002/msg00983.html) Guess they just conveniently never knew about that here in the states. \n\nThere is also Nestle, and [the shit they have been doing with baby formula.](https://www.businessinsider.com/nestles-infant-formula-scandal-2012-6) Also innocent. \n\nOr even going back to our government, NKUltra. The best we got was a president to cone out and say \"Yeah, we did that. Sorry.\" There was also the time we were lied to about them finding weapons of kass destruction in Iraq. That helped them start a war where many of our soldiers died, as well as many more civilians in the countries such as Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan. Our government was probably innocent of all of those as well.\n\nNow do I think the democrats don't have problems? That they never break the law? No. I know there's corruption in there as well. \n\nBut to this day, I would still be willing to bet money that Trump was involved with the Russian scandal.",

The CIA was just exposed for a coverup of sexual abuse, completely unrelated to the FBI case, though I should mention there isn't clarity on if it was the CIA or the Justice Department that has responsibility.  \n\nOrganizations small and large seem to routinely engage in coverup.  The Catholic Church is one of the largest organizations in the world, thus the extent of it's coverup may be in line which what is expected of a similarly sized organization.",

There are many people who wouldn't be able to survive without it-- their cultural religious heritages have built-in child rearing practices, built-in rites of passage, built-in constructs that give people self esteem, goals, and a framework for planning their future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReligion got us here in the first place-- we owe it to ourselves to apply the scientific method to all of it's teachings, so that we can find all of the hidden gems sitting amidst the bullshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see what China has done to religion in the name of homogeny and conformity-- and that there, it has led to the government superseding religion as the ultimate moral authority.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe government should not be a moral authority-- government servants should *epitomize* agnostic morality-- they should never be arbiters of morality.",

This is the stuff of civilization building.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt wasn't until some of us began bucking the system and working on this whole \"intellectualism\" thing that things began to change-- Greek philosophy, Roman engineering, Arabic Math, European agriculture, the dwindling intellectualism of the dark ages, giving rise to the Renaissance-- the rediscovery of the logic-based intellectualism of the past, and it's re-awakening. The formulation of trail and error, experimental model, data logging, and finally, the Scientific Method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you, Frances Bacon-- the words echoing from your grave taught us so much that 500 years later, we've advanced further in understanding the universe than we did in the preceding 70,000.",

It says in no uncertain terms that *NO ONE can have that something anymore*.\n\nShould innocent priests be able to piss and shit in a Target? Yes. They're human beings. \n\nShould pervy priests be able to play the peeping Tom in public restrooms? No, of course not.\n\nHow do you tell them apart? You can't, until they get caught preparing or doing. \n\nBecause there's no real way to enforce against someone's unrealized intentions prior to them committing a criminal act (like in minority report with precrime, which is obviously flawed), it seems like the next logical step to preventing bad stuff from helping is banning stuff. \n\nBut it isn't fair to persecute the affiliated class of a perpetrator with the same crime as the perpetrator. Sins of the father, and all that jazz.\n\nCancel culture is dumb because it is an inherently reactive witch hunt to prevent bad shit from happening in a perfect world that doesn't exist.\n\nIf we could cancel bad shit before bad shit happens, we would. But we can't. So we move to cancel bad shit when it happens like targeting an entire class of person is the first real solution to the otherwise incredibly complicated issues of criminality, innocence, and punishment.\n\nEdit: I'm not saying that religious pedophilia isn't a problem. It's a huge, unmitigated, disgusting problem where vile men hide behind the wealth and protection of the holy cloth to fuck children in the false name of God. I'm an atheist, so my first instinct isn't to say \"ban religion\" because the religious could easily say the same about us \"godless heathens\" and ban us, too. Goodness knows how that shit plays out in history...\n\nIt's about respect, and uniting against the common evil of hurting children, not just banning stuff because bad shit happens sometimes. I know many religious people that condemn this behavior. The religious aren't inherently the enemy of the areligious so long as respect is maintained. \n\nGood luck maintaining that when we didn't start the fire.",

Even wielded in innocence, I will agree that it is still dangerous, as it sets a precedent for the extension of what one considers accepted truth beyond the core set of accepted truths that are eminently necessary in the practice of religion.\n\nWhile many devout, fundamentalist, and otherwise preachy individuals feed into the systems of religion that drain followers dry, I know that many carry religion as a form of peace in the face of existential oblivion. \n\nIt's a tough thing to say that religion should not exist.

There are all sorts of variations that don't fit neatly into 2 strict boxes. In reality, most people don't notice or have an issue with it. \n\nAnd the threat posed by people pretending to be trans to use the women's restroom is extraordinarily overblown. Trans people are allowed to use the restroom of their choice pretty much all over the US and have been doing so for many decades, but it doesn't amount to the widespread problem it is made out to be. Crimes don't stop being crimes because trans people are allowed basic dignity, and it's still unusual for something like that to happen.  \n\nSo what you're proposing is to hurt many people in multiple ways because of the threat a very tiny number may theoretically pose but probably don't if evidence is considered. It is still ridiculous, even your idea, and I did notice that you cared not a lick for the violence trans women will experience in the men's room.

No. The only time self-defense is valid if there is an immediate threat to your life -- not just your fear that maybe they could pose a threat. Fear is not justification, even if there is a huge number of bigots out there who will excuse it or get away with it. It isn't right and should be opposed by all of us.\n\nIn the case of trans women it isn't even the fear that trans women are the threat, but other people, at least according to you. They don't pose an immediate threat, and there are already laws against the threat. If those laws don't stop people, then why will bigoted laws affecting innocent people work instead? They won't.

And the  opinion that  I\u2019m scared of is that democratic election results are only valid when the person they like wins. oh, and the person they like is generally demonstrated to be HIGHLY corrupt, and  whose agenda is personal enrichment at the expense of anyone else. And they aren\u2019t interested in hearing information that would change their minds.   \n\n\nthey\u2019re unfit to participate in a democracy in the current media landscape, given that they tend to prefer information sources that have been demonstrated to be intentionally misinforming them. They\u2019re less fit for being in a democracy than a voter that just flips a coin.\n\nTell me where I\u2019m factually incorrect.",

However the people behind this study have spent a ton of time making comments defending trans women from having their study used against them. Also the sample size was very low around 130 trans people so I think a comprehensive study looking into this particular question has not been done yet.  It should be mentioned that the majority of the research that vaguely fits this topic is on why transwomen are violently assaulted (sexual or otherwise) at 4x the rate of the cisgender population.  So I guess lower is a bit of a misnomer, i read a pretty long analysis of that Swedish study from Britain that found that the Swedish math applies in English prisons in terms of rate so at worst the data says it is at a similar rate to the cis community.  But again i want to see a more comprehensive study with more data",

Unfortunately it does nothing to help male children, but that's beside the point. \n\nOpening public restrooms to either sex tears down this bit of protection what women currently have. Target isn't going to be checking IDs at the restroom door, the choice of which restroom to use would be up to the individual. There's no feasible way to limit it to 'trans' people only, no matter what exact criteria you have in mind.\n\nSo I can see why people push back on this. Private unisex bathrooms are the obvious (and widely used) solution, but that's a long way off in The US.\n\nI never heard someone suggest that *trans* people are going to assault people. I've heard them point out that opening up bathrooms to either sex will probably increase the number of assaults.",

I'm also not complaining about them trying to correct that person, I'm arguing with them because they claimed to innocently be trying to correct them without actually doing the *correcting* part, and the only reason it got past the first comment was because instead of acknowledging it **which they later did and went out of their way to genuinely try to correct the person** is because they felt attacked by me pointing it out in the first place and made a big fucking argument about it. Literally all I said was that they didn't correct them, they just said a snarky comment, and it sent them off the deep end, and I gladly joined them.\n\nAccusations of racism are completely fucking outrageous, you can go fuck yourself. I come from the ghetto, my entire growing up experience heavily involved fighting against white blue collar racism. I literally grew up with a mother who would scream \"YES THE FUCK IT DOES\" when Michael Jackson would sing \"it don't matter if you're black or white\", and it's one of the primary reasons I no longer associate with her.

On May 28, she said, the two arranged to meet again and the youth threw her to the floor and forced her to perform sex acts\"\n\n\"The teen testified she arrived first and chose to go in the girls\u2019 bathroom because the two had always met in the girl's bathrooms in the past.\" \n\nNgl I think it's fucked up that certain ring wing media outlets were willing to weaponise a girls rape to attack trans people.(not having a go at yourself)\n\nAlso obviously it stupid to belive that no trans person is capable of being bad.\n\nFrom my perspective as a trans person, I just that want to be treated as individual, instead of being constantly collectively blamed for something I didn't do.

FOX News had over 170+ segments on trans high schoolers in sports. They could only find 7 trans girls the whole entire time, and absolutely none of them were dominating. Instead, it was Karens butthurt that their little babies placed 3rd after being the trans girls 10 times in other competitions. They ran to FOX to be their saviors, crying that their babies lost out on scholarships. Except, you know, their baby placed 3rd, meaning that they also lost to another cis girl.\n\nAlso, let's not forget that FOX mistook two cis girls as trans and the girls were sent death threats by viewers. One of the girls dropped out of school for the rest of the year because of it.",

I dont think a trans person shouldnt be allowed to play with the gender they identify as, but maybe mor science needs to be done to make it a more fair playing field.\n\nYou're correct in assuming more studies need to be done. However, when talking about trans women in women's sports we're talking about medically transitioned people. Transition involves lowering testosterone to the standard level with anti-androgens and taking estrogen. A lot of the advantages a man would have over a woman is due to testosterone and how it affects muscle growth and distribution, so a medically transitioned trans woman wouldn't have that advantage. There are obviously some developmental differences that can lead to an advantage but they don't seem to actually have that big of an effect and until more studies are done we can't say for sure.",

                              "text": ">  Its been proven that when it comes to trans women and cis women, the trans women usually triumph.\n\nThat is absolutely not true at all. Trans women constantly lose competitions. You just don't hear about it because the media doesn't report losses. FOX doesn't report it because it would break their bigotry and CNN doesn't report it because they only want the inspirational stuff.\n\nThere is very, very little research on trans people in sports. So what you have is nothing but competitions to look at, and trans women are losing FAR more than they are winning. Over 100 trans women have tried to enter the Olympics and only one has qualified, losing that weight lifting competitions. Remember Fallon Fox? The trans woman FOX lost their minds over because she broke a woman's occipital lobe? She won every competition. Except they were in her league. When she fought a cis woman in the professional league, she got her ass kicked. And, oh, gee, occipital breaks happen all the time because MMA is a dangerous contact sport [[cis woman 1](https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/3/16/18269212/molly-mccann-to-undergo-surgery-for-broken-orbital-after-ufc-london-win-over-priscila-cachoeira)] [[cis woman 2\\].](https://www.mmamania.com/2015/2/1/7960443/miesha-tate-suffers-broken-orbital-bone-at-ufc-183-then-blown-tire-super-bowl-49-mma)\n\nThis attack on trans people, trans women specifically, is nothing but a \"God of the gaps\" argument. Where not enough scientific information is there, so it must be that trans people are bad and not that transphobia has become trendy, pushing the next transphobic line each time one of them gets shut down. Absolutely nobody had any issue with trans people in sports circa 2015. Now suddenly trans people are in the news and everyone has an opinion and have become experts on trans people, forcing what they think is good for trans people onto them all because they saw a few news headlines or Youtube videos. Because guess what, what you read, and what is reality are often two very different things, especially in this day and age of internet propaganda. The facts are that trans women lose in sports just as much as any cis woman, and that is why women's sports leagues aren't rushing out to ban trans women after the decade or more of allowing trans women into their leagues.\n\nLet's also drag another fact into all of this. Black women win more than white women. It is an actual fact, especially when you have black women like Caster Semenya in sports who have a higher testosterone level than both cis women and trans women. Does this mean that we need to start banning black women from sports, or maybe even give them their own leagues? Or would that be considered racist, bigoted, and likened to segregation? Hmm...",

This man should never have been allowed to be a priest. Clergy are supposed to be the loving kind helping hand that you can trust, not what this man did.\n\nI think this also shows why there is such a distrust of clergy, and Christians, from others outside of Christianity, and even some who believe Jesus's teaching. There are generations of wrongdoing that have broken the trust of the people. \n\nThis is an example of why you see churches dying. It is a lot more than just this, but this is a good example. The conservative evangelical Christians haven't helped either, as they are ignoring key points of Jesus' teaching that are inconvenient to their beliefs and doing harm as a result.\n\nMe, I'm going to keep on loving my neighbor, all of them. I welcome trans people to use whatever bathroom they feel comfortable using. I support same sex marriage. Heck, I support poly marriage should that be your thing. I'm with the pregnant woman who is making the psychologically hard choice to have an abortion, and I believe she should have the right to choose. We are all in this world together. The world is what we make it, and I'd like it to be one of peace and unity. I hate to see the many good works that the church does be overshadowed by this mess certain members of my faith do. \n\nThe church I minister serves hundreds of families in need through our food pantry each week. Last month, we gave out over 17k lbs of food. This should be the example of Christianity. Helping our neighbors. We have a safe sanctuary policy we follow to ensure the safety of everyone. Our congregation also welcomes everyone as well. No matter who you are, who you love, or what you believe.\n\nIt is my hope that the broken trust can be repaired. I will keep fighting hard to do that. For all of you in this subreddit that have been harmed, I love you and I'm with you. You are not alone.",

There\u2019s a lot of talk about *them* raping people but they\u2019re 4x more likely to face violent crime including rape than the general \npopulation. \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.advocate.com/crime/2021/3/23/trans-people-four-times-likely-face-violent-crime-cis%3famp\n\nAnd bullying is a sure fire way too kill a teenager. Suicide is already the leading cause of death among teens in America and coupled with a lot of trans people being young it makes sense why their suicide rate is so high.\n\nBecause people *despise* them. The majority of people do not support trans people, and many of them actively hate them. This is especially true among teens who will ostracize and harass them for it.",

But you would endanger the lives of trans women especially, causing far more people to come to harm than bigoted laws banning trans women from restrooms will ever help. \n\nThere are already laws against child abusers, and they ignore those laws.

As a male who fully presents as male, if a random dude intentionally showed me his dick in a bathroom, I don't think there is a context where that would be okay, especially were I to be in a bathroom that does not have urinals or other open space where a penis might suddenly appear. The gender of the bathroom doesn't matter, the victim's age and gender do not matter. \n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that transgender people aren't generally super prepared to throw out their genitals in public as they are very often the part of their body that they are the least hyped about. \n\nPoint is, you're not wrong for being concerned about perverts in the bathroom. But it is wrong to conflate transgender people in general with perverts.",

Don't punish innocent transgender people for the crimes of others.\n\n>It does when you\u2019re a child. A 6 girl seeing a vagina in the women\u2019s restroom is not that insane, a 6 girl seeing a penis in the women\u2019s restroom is insane to me.\n\nUnder what circumstances do you imagine a 6yo girl is going to see a vagina in a public restroom? Have you ever been in one or asked a woman about their experiences in a restroom? It's not a \"vaginas out, ladies!\" situation. Any time genitals are intentionally made visible to a child in a restroom, there is cause for concern, a point that addresses your disagreement. If I had a daughter, I would not want some random woman exposing herself to my kid. Also, a child that young should not be left unattended under any circumstances. That's just bad parenting.\n\n>All im saying is by allowing anyone in any bathroom makes it easier for people with ill intentions to do what ever they had planned.\n\nWe're not allowing anyone in any bathroom. Women go in women's bathrooms and men go in men's bathrooms. Segregating transgender people only harms transgender people.\n\nTelling a man he can't go into a women's restroom isn't going to magically prevent that man from going into a women's restroom. The answer is harsher punishments for people who break the law in these cases, not punishing people who have nothing to do with it.\n\nYou're welcome. I don't have reason to pass judgement on you. I do think there's a possibility that you just have the wrong impression of the situation and are overly concerned about kids. None of that should negatively impact people who just want to live a normal life though.\n\nEdit: Apologies for more edits. I thought it was in bad form to not also thank you for taking the time to express your thoughts in a noncombative way. These situations can be difficult and get heated very easily so it's nice to have a chance to calmly discuss.",

Your proposal does absolutely nothing to address that. You've actually not ever even addressed that this is a real issue so it's incredibly difficult for any person to read your comments and not immediately write you off as transphobic. \n\n>No one is punishing them\n\nTranswomen risk being assaulted in men's bathrooms. It's well documented. While your proposal would not punish them in a legal sense, it does unnecessarily put them at risk for far worse. Remaining ignorant to that point but insisting on talking about it when there is widely available data on the subject just kinda stupid. \n\n> If you see a 6ft male enter the female restroom, if only biological females are allowed in there Then that is suspicious\n\nMale in this instance does not distinguish between cisgendered and transgendered. If a man walks into a women's restroom with the intent on sexually assaulting someone, trans or not, it's not going to be a fun time for anyone, so why are you so gung-ho on making sure only transwomen are not able to go into women's restrooms? \n\n>small children being shown inappropriate genitalia or even getting sexually assaulted\n\nYou somehow think it's appropriate to send small children into a restroom unattended.

I've got teeth that need fixing real bad because I didn't brush for years, but now I don't have the money and my insurance doesn't cover dental. I'm having health problems because I ruined my body with my depression diet (and fighting with doctors who are probably not treating me because I'm trans, as well as fighting with my insurance to cover the gall bladder removal I probably need). I still don't pass well and have been harassed on the street a few times and still get nasty stares when all I want to do is shop for groceries or clothes. I'm single and have been that way for quite some time now. I have to wake up stupidly early in the morning to shave/epilate my body and do my makeup, which I spend a fortune on makeup so that I can try to somewhat pass. I didn't come out until I was 34, so I struggled for decades. And I'm still paying on student debt because I had to quit working my last two years in college since it became a literal health hazard, and despite me making quite a lot of money, it all goes right out the window because of that debt and rent that keeps climbing every year. Then there are days like today where I've been awake for 30 hours working on both my research and a presentation that I need to give at noon. But thankfully I have the rest of the day off and will be sleeping in on Saturday.\n\nBut at the same time things are a whole hell of a lot better. Even though the fight with my body is unending and I see my bathroom more than any other room, I would never go back in the closet. All of my family is supportive (minus a Christian aunt and uncle and transphobic step-grandfather). All of my friends whom I grew up with have been supportive, though two of them ended up being trans themselves, lol. I was able to travel to meet friends in Australia a couple of years ago, all of whom allowed me to be myself around them even before the hormones. And... yeah, there is a lot of good happening, too.",

My links prove it actually is an issue and people are lying about it in the name of \"inclusivity\". The spa incident was called a hoax by mainstream journalists without doing any actual investigation just because it didn't fit their agenda. The highschool was trying to cover up the rape.

It places crime rates for trans people as near identical to the general populous. Also it\u2019s true that MTF trans people have increased rates of committing rape compared to biological women, including in prisons, but it falls below the average male and especially the average male prisoner. They have closer to a 60-80% chance of getting raped in a male prison depending on the source.  https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/18973/pdf/\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2021/06/23/us/trans-women-incarceration/index.html\n\nReally is a pretty bad situation but if you send a MTF prisoner to a male prison it\u2019s not really a question of if they\u2019ll get raped it\u2019s a question of when. Additionally the rates for sexual assault that wasn\u2019t rape it is effectively just 100% of trans inmates. Trans people in general are a lot more likely to be raped than to rape.",

Weird how quickly your tiny little mind changed its tune. \n\n>but don't woman constantly talk on here about how awful and sexually abrasive men are toward them? How they constantly have to carry a weapon at night because they are terrified of men? How men are sexual deviants and predators?\n\nTrans women aren't men and trans people on the whole are statistically far, far, far more likely to be the recipient of sexual violence than the perpetrator. \n\n>This fear is based on rape potential generally.. and the general fear of rape is unsolicited penetration. Penetration generally comes in the form of a penis.\n\nAh, so you're just an absolute worthless sack of festering shit, huh. When we hear about men not wanting to report sexual assault, particularly by women, remember that you are the problem. What an absolute waste of resources. Rot in hell where you belong you worthless pile of brainless sludge. \n\n>This isnt an attack on trans.. this is an attempt to protect children (whether from priests or from bathroom encounters), stop being so sensitive. This original post basically states stop worrying about trans population raping children in bathrooms, bc priests do it more often.\n\nIt absolutely is an attack on trans people. This transphobia does nothing to protect anyone, other than emboldening hate crimes against trans people by perpetuating hurtful and untrue stereotypes. Are you going to start examining people's genitals before they enter the restroom? Is that the plan here, shit for brains? I'm gonna guess even you can muster together your mental faculties enough to recognize how ridiculous an idea that is, as much of a strain as that will be on your limited cognitive ability, I urge you to try. \n\nThe post is pointing out that, as much as spineless cowards and worthless pieces of shit like you like to pin trans people as a target, like all of the sudden having a place to take a dump in peace is going to embolden some hidden sexual aggression that clearly all trans people must posses, or that non trans people will use it as a guise to try and enter a restroom and assault people, the reality is that rapists and perverts already fucking do that. It's a scapegoat used for slack jawed neanderthals like you use to attempt to justify your hatefulness. \n\n>If i start reading how scared women are at night of encountering and being raped by other women, then maybe your point starts to make a little sense. But they don't, and they wont.\n\nI love men explaining to women how they should feel about things. I hope for your kids' sake that they break free of the general miasma of idiocy swirling around you and become better, more intelligent people. Trans women aren't men, and you continued to perpetuated this absurd notion that sexual assault consists only of \"man rapes woman\" is beyond harmful and beyond stupid. Why don't you just come clean about the pile of sludge that you are and your prejudices instead of trying to explain to a woman how she should feel and what she should and shouldn't be afraid of, little bitch.",

Wow, how rude, just because I disagree with you\" horsehit? You really think anyone other than you is going to be fucking dumb enough to think that every single disagreement, even those that invalidate victims of sexual assault and marginalize people and treat them as sexual predators are equal to having a different opinion on a movie?

Even if those numbers are 100% accurate, do you think your assertions about teachers will fix either problem? Its whataboutism that does nothing but redirect attention away from the church, which only helps the church CONTINUE to hurt children... as a teacher I care a lot about children and their well being, it isnt about theism or anti theism... and that means dealing with the catholic church... there isnt some news story about a safe haven of pedo teachers in rural Arizona... mostly because there isnt a global organization redirecting teachers to new opportunities to assault.  Trust me (again as a teacher) a long conversation needs to be had about preventing sexual abuse in schools but not if we are only having it to deride complaints about the catholic church",

Calling priests pedophiles and saying they shouldn't be allowed into bathrooms (and then connecting it to the bathroom conflict back in Trump era for whatever reason) WITHOUT making a point to reflect the catholic churches crimes, using a local news story (and something about Miami). \n\nThe thread, the point of the post, is not to address the atrocity that is sexual abuse, and the taking of innocence.\n\nThe thread is to poke fun at theists because the people who hold authority roles in their sects do bad things, just like cops and blue lives matter, just like Islamic sects and Islamic Extremists.\n\nI feel a little bad because even what I said there was whataboutism, its almost impossible to avoid in religious discussion, especially as someone who is as casually Christian as myself. I think there are plenty of issues to address, and leaders in our community need to be the ones to step up and assume responsibility (and also just sorta cross off Mormons on the list of Christian sects)\n\nI was an athiest for a long time, I found my faith when I went through several low points, and something that always irked me about this community was the grandstanding about sexual abuse.",

Notice that men don\u2019t really prey on other men? Physical strength is a major deterrent to rape. So men that prey on little boys will prey on them in the men\u2019s restroom when unattended. Men who prey on women and girls now can and do dress as or claim to be women and do so in the women\u2019s restroom. This does, has, and will continue to happen. People whom are against trans women using women\u2019s restrooms just wish to prevent as much rape and sexual assault as possible. That being said Trans-people are people and should have respect until they decide to remove it as this \u201cman of the cloth\u201d did. I believe all sexual predators should be dealt with harshly and without remorse.",

No matter what you think or feel about transgender people or the politics and philosophical debates surrounding them, it's *people* who are assaulting people in bathrooms. We love to pattern-match so we're always pointing the finger at categories of people. Why don't we focus on the actual roots of the problem? Public bathrooms are poorly designed, with gaps in the doors. If you think they're made that way to control homeless people or drug users then we should be solving homelessness and drug use, not stripping everyone of dignity and safety. It would be cheaper and better for everyone, and would lower crime rates and anxiety. Remember, drug use isn't a moral problem, it's a social problem. Create more loving and inclusive communities, designed for human beings *as we have evolved to live.* We're animals. It's nonsensical to tell the type of animal to change into something \"ideal\" instead of to design a society for the type of animal as it is. Also, our gender roles are toxic. We're too lenient with the misdeeds of religious organizations. We don't invest enough in child welfare. Our economy and infrastructure and social norms are isolating, which encourages both mental illness and antisocial behaviour. The solution is to push HARD for our culture to be more respectful of the human soul. The free market does not assign a correct value to the human soul. Correct for it.",

Nurses, doctors, pharmacists, and dentists have a higher than average drug addiction rate than say accountants. Medical school and medical training doesn\u2019t cause the addiction, it provides access, opportunity, and knowledge about how to hide addiction. \n\nFor example, I personally know a dentist who was (by all accounts) an upstanding guy. He started using his anesthesia recreationally and eventually lost everything. \nThere is a higher than average incidence of pedophilia among clergy, teachers, coaches, scout leaders, law enforcement, etc. because of two things. They have access to children and these jobs provide the cover of authority. Does religion play into this? Certainly. You\u2019ll read stories about parents trusting their sons to go off to a lake house alone with a priest. \n\nThere is no way in heaven or hell my child would be alone with another non-family adult in a situation like that. Even with family and in general, I emphasized to my kids that I would always believe them and that no one walking the earth could prevent me from protecting them and our family. I don\u2019t believe in the death penalty, but I would straight up kill anyone threatening my child if the law didn\u2019t stop them.",

While they didn't delve into the last one, they openly stated to us, as part of their written documentation, that homosexuals showed no greater, or lesser, tendency to child molestation than any heterosexual people.\n\nThey are quite aware that it's a deeper issue than that, regardless of how they feel about open homosexuality as a Church and didn't pull any punches.",

And it would be INCREDIBLY misleading to call a summary by the publisher any kind of \"abstract\"... also, it's great you heard the term Dunning-Krueger for the first time, but noone cares... journal abstract is something YOU made up, if you google the term \"journal abstract\" all you find is how to write an abstract AS THE AUTHOR OF THE PAPER... find me the definition that says \"it's what the publishers want to say to sell papers\"  because that's not a god damn abstract... speaking of brick walls",

(as I mentioned, can YOU read)  so if the abstract misrepresents the data, the researchers are misrepresenting their data which is a sign of a bad paper... so I will ask again, are you trying to pass off a shitty source as a good one because it \"fits\" (it fucking doesnt) your narrative.\n\nAlso you are right the research i was credited on didnt matter.  It was how rubies change density under different LASERS which was thought to have implications in micro processors (or something computational) and wasnt... I spent hours screwing and unscrewing different lenses and mirrors for the PhD student running it... good dude, miss Kevin\n\nAnyways to sum it up... that is absolutely not what the abstract is for and even if you are right and the abstract misrepresents the paper, that doesnt make the argument you think it does",
