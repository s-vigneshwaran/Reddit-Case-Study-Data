We force nonsense into their heads during their most formative years and we see the consequences of it playing out when they become adults.",

Party politics, regardless of which party, are so divisive, and so counter productive to free, open-minded-to-other's-beliefs society. This is not to say that I believe you have to give up your beliefs in order to be accepting of other people, but when you put loyalty to your \"party\" above your loyalty to your country as a whole, or even above whatever diety or higher power (if any) you believe in, you are contributing to the issue. When you decide that someone who believes differently that you, but has never attacked you in any way (such as the driver of the car with the bumper sticker you mentioned) then you clearly believe this person is somehow \"lesser\" than you. That means you don't believe in Liberty and Justice for All. As for me, I refuse to align with any political party at all. I refuse to prejudice against any religion- and that refusal Ultimately got me kicked out of the church I grew up in. That is not to say I no longer believe in God, because I still do. I just don't discriminate against people of other religions. I don't discriminate against people who choose to align themselves with a political party, despite my distaste for that system. (System, not people). Perhaps if everyone had the same mindset, none of any of what has been discussed in this post would be an issue. IE: hold firmly to your beliefs, but don't discriminate against others. Now, taking action against criminal activity, or activities that would cause harm to another person is not discrimination.",

One can see why the real wording is much more \"problematic\" for today's youth.)\n\nIn a class of independent thinkers, one should expect argument and a variety of opinions.  If the issue is settled rather unanimously, then maybe that fundie parent was not entirely wrong.\n\nI would recommend ending the day by having everyone read Orwell's short article about fascism to see that even a mere couple of years after WWII, intelligent people were already bemoaning the trend of the masses calling anything fascist on the quality that they dislike it.\n\nJust a thought.",

Especially, if you are an atheist since you will have no absent deity to\nrage at.  Also, from what position do you even argue that human life is not the same brutal struggle as *all life*!?\n\nEither one must believe that *all life is sacred* or that it is not.  If all life is not sacred, then we have no duty to our fellow man beyond that which benefits ourselves.

The intent was to allow government and religion to coexist harmoniously, yet still free of the other's influence. It was specifically designed to prevent, as you put it, \"the structure of religious government managing society as a whole\" without getting rid of, or in any way impeding any form of religion. While never perfectly, there was a time when, generally speaking, it worked fairly well. But that was at a time when folks were, again, not perfect, but generally respectful of one another is this country",

Since the story blends religion and politics, I can see how I could have been misunderstood.\n\nYou *are* correct, though, that it is truly religion 'all the way down'... those who dwell on the political left and demand censorship are, in reality, practicing a form or religiosity even if they don't realize it.  They have an ordained dogma, and they believe that any who question it or speak against it are heretics and should be pushed out of society lest they \"pollute the minds\" of the faithful or the youth.  They even have their own fetish items to ward off bad spirits, the covid masks are a prime example... they offer all the protection against covid as a crucifix or Yamaka or rabbit's foot, but if one tells them this, they react with anger and want to silence the truth rather than accept it.\n\nSo, my point is that, unfortunately, we find ourselves stuck between two opposing religious cults, each becoming more fervently dogmatic, and neither willing to accept reality and rational thought.\n\nAlso, your statement about \"belief isn't a function of science\" goes *precisely to my point*.  Science is a *process*, an adversarial process at that, and can only be corrupted and never strengthened by censoring or ignoring contrary findings and opposing theories to our current understanding.  The most important aspect of the scientific process is that *one should NEVER trust \"the science\", they should always challenge it.*",

This has been obvious to anyone with any critical thinking ability.\n\nI have heard every argument that you make, and if it makes you feel better, wear it.  But the CDC has finally even come right out and stated that these masks provide essentially *zero* protection.\n\nAnd, for those who wear multiple cloth or paper masks to feel protected (*as opposed to simply investing in a proper respirator*) they *100% are* equivalent to a tribal fetish charm.\n\n(Note:  I was actually quite fortunate that just prior to the pandemic, I had bought and renovated my house at a deep discount because it was infested with black mold, it was only by this that I was fortunately prepared with a respirator and spare filters.  Back then, using any mask available made sense, it does not anymore because the proper kind are once more available to purchase.)",

There is no excuse for this and to argue the point is not only wrong, but fucking dangerous. \n\nJust like it was fucking dangerous when pharma companies fudged the effectiveness of vaccines and told people that they were 95% effective at preventing infection.

You see in on all sides perpetrated by many parties.  \n\nAnd now the power of these words is almost meaningless.  When everything is fascism or racism or socialism or capitalism and the ideology of a group is captured by tautological thinking, that group quickly becomes one people stop taking seriously.\n\nI see it on the far left (where I have a lot of overlap) and the far right.  It's tribal thinking and lazy use of language.  And again, it just ends up being the case people won't listen to you anymore.  Not what I want for 'my team'.",

Charlottesville 'Unite The Right' rally was full of facist symolism and featured a tiki torch lit march where they chanted 'Jews will not replace us!' https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54sP0Nlngg\n\n2. The January 6th, 2021 attack on the United States of America was spearheaded by multiple fascist organizations including the Proud Boys, Three Percenters, and Oath Keepers. Others carried literal fascist flags, wore fascist attire ([one wore a 'Camp Auschwitz' sweatshirt](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/man-camp-auschwitz-shirt-photographed-u-s-capitol-riot-arrested-n1254070)).\n\n3. The [2021 CPAC](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2021/03/02/cpac-2021-stage-design-public-high-five-white-supremacy-column/6883518002/) stage was a fascist symbol appropriated by the Nazis in WWII. \n\n4. Patriot Front, yet another fascist group, just marched in multiple cities, including DC at the [March for life](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/patriot-front-s-anti-abortion-advocacy-march-life-sends-clear-ncna1287952)\n\nThese are just a few of the obvious ones. Then you look at the underlying elements of fascism: [palingenetic ultranationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palingenetic_ultranationalism). Fascism is the confluence of the idea that one's country is being destroyed by an \"other\", that we can return to a former glory but we need to put the real patriots back in power by any means necessary. \n\nCompare that to the idea that America has turned to shit because the \"others\" (i.e. hispanic immigrants, muslims, African-Americans) and those who support them (i.e. liberals) aren't *real* Americans. That we need to \"Make America Great Again\" (i.e. return to a former glory) by any means necessary (i.e. hang Mike Pence) because we, the *real Americans* deserve to be in power. \n\n[If you have 23 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Luu1Beb8ng).",

Several times this year I've said things that every other kid in class know to be true, and he grew up thinking something else.\n\nFor what it is worth though, he is very open minded, is amazed at this new information, and I think a little pissed off now.\n\nEDIT: Just cuz this is getting some traction: I teach right next door to another science teacher who is a fundamentalist. He told me flat out \"There is no such thing as evolution. It is adaptation.\" \n\nI know what his problem is - if he believes in evolution, then he can't believe in creation as he understands it. So he just won't talk about evolution at all in his class, but it is a full day lecture in mine, even though I teach chemistry and physics. \n\nBonus: He has had Covid twice, won't get vaccinated, and still won't wear a mask unless mandated to at work. Even then, he wears one of those giant plastic face shields instead. I cannot wait to retire in a couple of years.",

My father (who is an atheist since birth) still refuses to acknowledge the existence of climate change. I think it stems more from right wing propaganda and \"patriotism\" than religion just religion. Religion of course increases the probability that someone will live in other delusions, but denying climate change mostly serves the interests of fossil fuel companies and the right, which happens to be aligned with religions. My father watches/listens exclusively to right wing television/radio channels, and any left wing argument he ignores calling it communist and unpatriotic.

When did the curriculum change?\n\nAlso, the bit about covid and the mask is irrelevant. especially now that we know neither mask nor the shot work. Most of the people catching the cold are triple boosted and wear a mask like it's completely replaced any other religion. People get sick. It happens. I hope you understand that much at least.",

There are some attempts by Christian \"scientists\" to figure out where the ages came from.  They seem to lean towards two ideas:\nThe Mesopotamians used a base 60 number system.  \nThe Mesopotamians have sacred numbers that don't necessarily match to ages.\n\nSo, somehow, a mixing of those two things resulted in getting the ages all crazy.  They seem to really be reaching with this.  It is kind of fascinating reading what seems like a well-researched and well presented article about very real history in an attempt to make realistic sense of the bible.  But they just can't do it, so they are left with this mess.  If you read this article below, just take a look at page 8, it is their chart about how the dates may have come to be.  \n\nI commend them for trying to incorporate their religion with science, but the cognitive dissonance has to be INTENSE.\n\nhttps://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2003/PSCF12-03Hill.pdf",

Any parent can tell you this takes a bit of time for people to learn this concept. Caring about, fighting for, worrying about those around you isn't something we start out with.\n\nThe majority of us get to stage 1. The ones that don't, well they end up spending a lot of their life being alone because no one can stand them. Stage 2 is us vs them. When we recognize the validity of other tribes. At this point no government has really achieved this but plenty of regular people have. \n\nTo me this is a fundamental difference between progressive and conservative differences in the west. One can accept, maybe to only a limited extent, that our world is full of tribes and the validity of them. They are capable of a statements like \"I am straight and know no homosexuals, but gay marriage should be legal\" for example. The other one is capable of understanding that they are part of a tribe but incapable of understanding that other tribes exist except to consume resources.",

Ya know, the \"regular mom\" that takes her child to Church, or the politician that constantly invokes God to resonate with the dumb masses that they call their constituents or voters. Most people here and in the real world can't make the connection between self and community, as you said, and that many small actions have consequences down the line. If you dare suggest anything more drastic than \"just ignore them\", then you get banned, even if it's something non-violent. (Which it obviously should be. I DON'T support people suggesting violent things because that doesn't work and gives the religious nuts more ammo by people doing the very thing the religious are accusing them of. There ARE more drastic things that DON'T involve harm.)\n\nMy point is that because of mods and agendas, you are free to express your distaste for the dangerous death cult but you must still ONLY \"ignore\" them while they're free to keep doing dangerous shit to children and government and the planet over and over. If you dare suggest anything the reverse of that but just as drastic, you are downvoted or have your comment deleted for being \"uncivil\" at best, and at worst, get banned for \"being hateful\", because even while a group of nutcases are destroying countries and planets, we are all, in reality just supposed to quietly complain and that's it. Nothing that *actually* may make a change or threaten their power on society isn't allowed.",

These are independent floods that happen from time to time.\n\nThe earth is full of water. The water has nowhere to go on a global scale for there to be a great flood that then goes away. The only way for there to be a great flood is if ice melts and the water becomes semi permanently part of the overall pool of water that is available to the water cycle. And even that water won't subside so quickly as to not make the world nearly permanently flooded in that lifetime.\n\nDon't be so quick to give religious stories credence by saying they're based on truth. Scientifically, there's no way for a global flood to occur unless aliens dump water on the earth and then suck it back up again after they're done. There simply is nowhere for the water to go. \n\nAlso, if there was a global flood, probably all the fish would die since for saltwater fish, the water would be too diluted.",

You live an effectively \"Godless existence \ud83d\ude31\" not taking any particular religious beliefs or practices into account during your decision process on a day-to-day basis. But because you've been able to get by just fine without having to nail down your feelings on the matter, or explore the larger implications of faith, and religion on your life, or the rest of the world, you simply default to \"agnostic\" because \"what does it matter if it doesn't affect me?\". Similar, but distinct from the idiotic \"Living in a simulation!\" meme crisis wouldn't actually have any effect on our reality, therefore, litteraly DOES NOT MATTER. If the magic sandbox we're playing in is effectively infinite and the vail impenetrable, it doesn't matter what's on the other side, because we will never reach it.\n\nThe primary difference is that regardless of how little you think that faith in a magic Space Daddy has on your life, it has a TON. Nearly every politician not just publically states their belief in a God, but have constant battles to \"out-faith\" each other. Constantly causing political strife, blockading badly needed reform, funding for scientific endeavors, simple admissions of long settled facts around climate change, cancer causing industries, religious based conflicts, and incalculable other forces that cause the deaths of millions every year.",

We are not claiming that anything extraordinary exists, the ones claiming it are responsible to bring the evidence, not the other way around. \n\nThe above makes you an aTHEIST, not an aDEIST or aPANTHEIST or aSIMULATIONIST.

If I have a box that may or may not have a coin inside of it, assuming that there is no coin is equally as nonsensical as assuming there is. For that reason, atheism and agnosticism are not mutually exclusive. A person who does not make a claim as to whether or not there is a God and does not hold a belief in any God is, by definition, both an agnostic and an atheist. Secondly, your video about the simulation hypothesis fails to address the argument that u/GrishdaFish was making. It explains why the assumption that the sinulation hypothesis is correct is nonsensical but does not address the viewpoint that it may or may not be correct. Being an agnostic is noncommittal to the question of the existence of God, and that's a good thing. I will not commit to an answer to the question \"does a gos exist\" until I have evidence either way. With no evidence, agnostic atheism is the only sensible conclusion.",

Consider it is possible that there are people that reject intervening deities as stated by theism and define themselves as atheists.

You know that if some deity intervenes, we should see it. I see no coin in your box, so there is no coin for me. If you are telling me that the coin is invisible, then prove it. So, we have the information, the coin is not there. Do you have an invisible/untouchable coin? I would say that it is very unlikely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>And no, we would not be agnostic about everything in life. That's because there are implicit conditions in most statements we make.

Color is not a physical property but an arbitrary perception assignment. Different cultures perceive colors in different ways. We cannot even tell if what I see as blue is the same you see as blue. So we all should be color agnostic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>There is evidence to indicate that unicorns originated as a myth. \n\nAs there is evidence that the theistic gods originated as myths such as Anu and Antu, El and Ashera, etc.",

Perhaps I wasn't clear with this, but the box was supposed to be closed, and I meant to ignore things like shaking the box and listening for a sound for the purposes of the analogy, as there is no analogous experiment we can conduct to reveal a god.\n\nAlso, the \"me\" in that coin in a box example does not refer to me but to one's own thoughts. It is not making a claim, but asking a question with three answers: yes, no, and not enough information.\n\nYou didn't refute anything I said with regards to my example about the blue toothbrush. Ambiguity and uncertainty are not the same.\n\nI agree with your last statement.

I respect your views and I think we are not going to resolve this issue here. \n\nI just wanted to express my view, and probably of many others, that consider themselves atheists as opposing theism as defined by the major theistic religions. I consider it is impossible to provide an answer before knowing the questions. So, my answer is to the theistic god hypothesis. This hypothesis is testable so it is not a black box. You can perform many experiments and check for gods intervention (global prayer, proof of miracles, etc).  There are many other hypothesis out there (and more will come) that cannot be tested (simulation, multiverse, etc). I consider these hypotheses useless as there is no value out of them. We cannot predict anything and we cannot act on a certain way because of them. Also, we can produce an infinite number of non testable theories that would add nothing to our lives.\n\nI think we are tackling the subject from different angles but our understanding is probably more similar than it looks. You probably don't believe on any theistic gods and I am agnostic of any other non-testable hypotheses (by definition) but I consider them meaningless so I don't define my views based on them.",

Effectively redefining the word \"Proof\". If there were any proof at all, either for or against. The argument would be over. There would literally be no room for argument at all.

Accepting the facts, but stopping short of putting your support behind it.\n\nAs for the \"Science doesn't have all the answers\" BS argument.

Either the priests fled their parishes in an attempt to save their hides, or, the ones that came to the sick and dying to disperse the last rites, got infected and died soon after. People grew incredibly disillusioned with religion after every wave of the Black Death, this was especially true with the waves in the 17th century.\n\nWe may well be facing the same results here.",

The people it was intended for back in the day likely used it for very different purposes, and it\u2019s more intelligent to read it like a historian or anthropologist than as a literalist like today\u2019s evangelical idiots do. \n\nTo break that down:\n\n>\tI\u2019m always amused at how little thought people put into the flood story.\n\nBy modern standards. You were more educated and literate by third grade than were 99% of people alive at the time the Flood story was written, and you have read more in the past year than the \u201chighly educated\u201d priests and scribes of the day did in their entire lives. So you\u2019re holding some very ancient people to a literally impossible subjective measure. \n\n>\tWhat would happen to plant life if it spent a year under water?\n\nThis assumes that the numbers in the OT were meant to be literal and not symbolic. Few if any numbers in ancient writing can be taken literally - they were no more numerate than they were literate, and numbers were far more often used as placeholder for things like \u201cmystical amount\u201d and \u201clots and lots\u201d than they were intended to be accurate counts. The 40 days and 40 nights in the flood story were more likely originally intended as \u201ca very very long rainfall\u201d than a specific count. And when you consider that the flood season in ancient Mesopotamia might easily last a month in a bad year, 40 days makes sense as \u201cmuch longer than the normal flood\u201d. \n\n>\tWhat happens to aquatic life since the oceans mix with the fresh water. \n\nThe marshes in Southern Iraq are brackish. So it\u2019s not a stretch to think desert dwellers found it plausible. \n\nSpeaking of, despite the clear language of Genesis describing a flood that covered the entire Earth, the ancient peoples of the region had no concept of a world much larger than the area Egypt-Turkey-Armenia-Iran-Saudi Arabia today. A story heard as \u201ca flood that covered that whole area\u201d isn\u2019t insanely improbable, and since none of them had ever seen Mt Ararat, hearing \u201cso high it covered even the highest hills\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into the \u2018literal miles of water\u2019 we hear today. \n\n>\tWhat about all of the creatures that have a lifespan less than a year?\n\nRemember: spontaneous generation was more or less universally believed to be a thing until the 18th century. They likely thought they\u2019d just literally pop out of the ground. \n\n>\tI\u2019m fine with it if it\u2019s just a story, but when you say it\u2019s history, you show a serious inability to think.\n\nModern readers, yes. Zero excuse. Jfc guys, get with the program. \n\nAncient readers? The story is actually pretty sophisticated when you think about it. It shows a wide geographic knowledge, a complex understanding of natural forces, an awareness of ship building, and even broad zoological knowledge. That it breaks down in the face of basic principles of animal husbandry doesn\u2019t alter that.",

I find it fascinating.\n\nI mean, short version not attempting to do it justice at all - my favourite theories around the origin of the deluge myth, are rising waters after the last ice-age, such as a possible [flooding of the persian gulf](http://emvc.geol.ucsb.edu/2_infopgs/IP2IceAge/ePersGulfFlood.html).\n\n6000+ years ago, so ~4000BC - roughly 2000 years before we started writing any of this down.  So 2000 years of oral tradition before it enters written history in myth form.\n\nI find the possibility that we have 6000 years of oral tradition pretty awesome.  Obviously there's been some dubious reboots and money-grabbing sequels along the way, but the fundamental root of miraculous (or statistically improbable if you prefer) survivors of a world-changing flood, seems to be in enough different cultures that I don't feel silly wondering if there's some meat on the bone.\n\n(I don't mean like .. were the survivors warned, etc.  Just the idea that something so geologically profound happened that we haven't quite forgotten)",

You allow yourself to ignore critical truths, ignoring what doesn\u2019t make you feel safe.  \n\nAs a result, it feels like a lot of religious folk have zero critical thinking skills anymore and have learned to accept the massive cognitive dissonance going on in their head 24/7.",

They can conceive of an animal that looks like a serval *(or some other wild cat)* evolving into Tigers, Lions, house cats, bobcats, etc all in just hundreds to thousands of years, but for some reason there's an imaginary line that halts that process arbitrarily wherever Kent Hovind decides to define *\"kind\"* that day of the week. \n\n>Some creationists claim that the fossil record is the remains of all the creatures that drowned in the Flood.

Literally all you need is a kitchen scale to prove the first hypothesis wrong.\n2. The second hypothesis is equally brain dead considering if that were the case we would expect the upper layers to be pretty much exclusively populated by fish, cetaceans, and other marine life.

We test for rote learning. Soak up the rubbish like a sponge, squeeze it out at the test, don't think, don't question, just rinse the sponge for the next test because what you just squeezed isn't required knowledge anymore. We already tested that.\n\nWhat exactly do we expect our kids to learn that way? \n\nNow add the biggest offenders in the fold, the \"teachers\" (I'll use that term losely here) who actually punish students for asking \"stupid\" questions (read: the ones they can't answer). Or, worse, point out where the teachers talk rubbish and teach bullshit. Because, and I wish I was making that up, as I was told by someone who actually is allowed to waste the formative years of our kids by pretending to teach them something, it's more important that they learn obedience and believing their elders than to question them.\n\nWith that, why do you wonder what garbage education levels the population is suffering from?",

This is the follow up to his 30 minute lecture I received on his findings during his tour. \nThis full color, trifold brochure is a work of art. Mildly bad font choice. Excellent grainy photos like he took photos of a postcard for sale at the gift shop with a 1994 35mm film. Random Bible quotes not even related to the ark story. It\u2019s got it all. \nI am at a full fascinated stop at this point because I think I remember falling asleep to one of the History Channel\u2019s clickbaity shows about this very story and how it\u2019s a rock, carved out by a now dry river that resembles a man made boat. I thought up until this point that it was just a story he knew and he was being a friendly old man. He had also mentioned during my breakfast lecture how Covid was a government hoax. Nope. Nuttier than squirrel poo. He really was obsessed with this \u201cartifact\u201d and it is now his life\u2019s work to spread the story. I rightfully give this nut job my full attention and he sees the fascination in my eyes and whispers the real truth bomb. They\u2019re doing an \u201cultrasonic scan\u201d and proving it\u2019s a boat. He nodded at me, then left. \nIm off tomorrow, but I\u2019m thinking about coming in just to see this man again. \nHe also forgot to pay, but left a $5 tip.",

Some things that they tried to teach us:\n\n\"They're lying about dinosaurs, but they're too stupid to realize it. They don't even know *when* dinosaurs *supposedly* existed, but they think they know that too. If you dig down a 1,000 feet and ask a scientist 'how old is this rock?' they will look in it for a fossil of a bug or something and say 'that bug is 600,000 years old, so we know that the rock is 600,000 years old! Science!\" But then if you turn around and find a fossil of a bug and ask them how old the bug is, they will look at the rock it came from and say \"That rock is 600,000 years old, so the bug has to be 600,000 years old! Science!\" It's just a big circle of lies. Then they tell you 'We use carbon dating to scan and check the rock for its age based on carbon content. That's why we are sure.' But they just compare the carbon reading to the carbon reading for the supposedly 600,000 year-old rock and say 'Wow, their carbon levels match, so they're the same age! Science!' See? Even with carbon dating they still just end up going back to the circle of lies. Some guy decades ago lied about the age of some rock, and ever since then a line of scientists has marched up behind them saying \"I compared that to MY rocks and now I know how old MY rocks are! Science!\"\n\n\nAnd:\n\n\"Hey you! The scrawny youngest kid in the back! Come up here to the front of the class! Okay everybody, see this plank of wood? I need it to build a HUGE boat. We can't have any leaks or we will sink to the bottom of the ocean, so I need your cut to be PERFECTLY straight! Scrawny Kid, please use this hand saw to cut it perfectly in half. (scrawny kid struggles) See? When you don't have a chainsaw, building a boat is incredibly difficult. NOW do you see how impressive it is that Noah built the Arc?\"",

Science just can\u2019t explain it yet correct?

We can however disprove large portions of the creation story pretty easily. \n\n>Sounds a whole lot like what God is to religious people.\n\nAgain, no. \"God\" is a concept based on a lack of knowledge. That is why your priest/pastor/religious leaders preach having faith. They know that they can never, and will never be able to win an argument based on fact. The entire point of a god is that you don't know or don't comprehend things, and it offers a simple explanation. Science uses evidence based fact to decipher things that we can conclusively say happened. \n\n>That doesn\u2019t mean science will never be able to, it just currently cannot\n\nIt is, and it will be forever impossible to gather impiracal data from the afterlife. I am a scientist, I can state this conclusively with an informed basis of knowledge. Lack of an ability to disprove something that \"might be\" is not an argument in its favour. It's just a lack of evidence. \n\nLet me put it this way. If the Bible said that humans lived in the middle of the Sun, would you believe it? It's unlikely we'll be able to send probes or humans into the middle of the sun, even with advances in technology. You and I know that humans can't survive there, but if the book said it, do you believe it? \n\nBetter example, if me and my friends wrote a book about how our buddy Jim was a great guy and turned water into wine, then floated up into the sky, would you believe that? Probably not, right? You'd want to see a video or something. So why is that burden of proof not held to a group of buddies from 2000 years ago? Realize how almost all of his \"miracles\" took place only in front of his closest disciples? Real convenient huh?",

First off gonna get this outta the way an educated belief is still a belief so yes you believe in the Big Bang as do I. Modern science can not explain the origins of the Big Bang. Obviously that doesn\u2019t prove that a God exists just throwing that out there because that\u2019s what I meant when I said it sounds supernatural but of course it isn\u2019t supernatural, we just don\u2019t have the tools necessary to explain it yet. And as far as we know science may never be able to explain it. But it still happened. This is similar to my (and I would assume most religious peoples) opinion on god. We may be able to prove god (the creator of the universe and Big Bang which I worship through Christianity) exists but we also may never be able to but our ability to or not has no bearing on whether or not he exists.\n\nAnd to get to your next point about the sun, no I would not believe that because at that point you\u2019ve created a different religion from the one I practice. That\u2019s a inherently ridiculous question- \u201cif there was an alternate universe where an alternate version of your religion said something completely false would you still believe it\u201d of course not. I believe in my religion not alternate versions of my religion or other currently existing religions.\n\nAnd for the record (I feel like this shouldn\u2019t have to be explained) but there\u2019s a lot more to practicing, than just taking someone\u2019s word for it that something happened 2000 years ago, and not have any current relationship with your ideology and see Him in nothing ever since. Quite the contrary. God is like the force through which life breathes, which we see every single day; the complex structure through which life breeds and evolves- an entity you can talk to, vent to, thank for things, ask for things\u2014 in Christianity it\u2019s often described like a two way relationship that you practice. And even more than that- the concept of justice and love and compassion. This life is such a mixed bag, great things and horrible things, but we rest assured knowing that this isn\u2019t forever. That the same force that our existence into motion- entity, god, \u201cthe universe\u201d, whatever name you want to call it\u2014 is waiting on the other side, and we have no clue what that looks like now but we embrace it with open arms. The Old Testament was just the start, the prophecy, written by fallible man, which Jesus came thousands of years later to fulfill in death, so that the spark that powers our bodies which we call a \u201csoul\u201d (secular probably just electricity) could be set free. And yes, man is fallible, like I said, so I\u2019m not gonna sit here and have a scientific debate over Jesus\u2019s specific actions, because the most important thing that Jesus did is already accomplished and we are free and get to live it.  That\u2019s the core of the belief- not to take someone\u2019s word for it no questions asked, but to live it, and to live it with love. So with that, no, I would not believe your buddy Jim, unless Jim fit all that criteria. Also I know your hypotheticals are meant to preposterous on purpose but with that all said I\u2019m not going to be answering anything else that\u2019s on the level of \u201chaha! Jesus = magic! Why don\u2019t you believe in Santa!?\u201d So if that\u2019s all you have in you then please save your time.",

At 600 years, 2 months and 10 days old, Noah built the ark which was only 437'x73'x44' intended to house two of ALL land creatures plus all the different vegetation. God decided that people were evil and decided everyone except Noah and his family (and his sons' wives) were the only ones fit to continue living. After this, human lifespan was set at 120 years. (Gen 6-8)\n\nSo you got vengeful POS God, and you have an extra 100 years on the guy. This is canonically why we live shorter lives (according to their holy book).\n\nI'm not one bit surprised by the batshit crazy things that these people believe because it all requires the same amount of \"faith\"",

      "text": "Christian Here but want to interject with a few points.\n\n1.  Based on the bible, the Ark itself took Noah and his 3 sons, (so 4 people) anywhere between 20 and 75 years to build based on information around the Age of them all, when things happened, and the timeline given by god for mankind's destruction.\n2. While you assume it was Noah that Gathered the Animals.  I prefer to believe (and yes, here is where belief comes in) that God gathered the animals,  He just made them walk there from wherever they were,  some may have been traveling for weeks/months, but they all arrived within the 7 day period.\n\nThat being said,  it is still beyond me how the US managed to politicize the shit you do.  I would also argue that wearing a mask, getting vaccinated and looking out for people is actually God/Christs commands. He tells us to be selfless, yet refusing to wear a Mask is extremely Selfish, the complete opposite.\n\nOverall,  Just because some Christians have been brainwashed by the US right wing machine, doesn't mean all of us believe the same thing.",

She said, there is this god thing that half the kids at school believe and half don\u2019t. Is it real? At first my wife not prepared said, I don\u2019t know. My daughter quickly replied with, well google it mum! So without a satisfying explanation she came to me. \n\nNot wanting to make a big deal out of it, I explained very quickly that the half that believe think there is a man in the sky who made everything, the earth, the plants, the animals and he controls everything that happens. Then I asked her if she thought that sounded true to her. She simply laughed and said no! and we moved on. She has since grown to have a great interest in science and medicine and does very well for herself. \n\nI love that my children grow up in a world where they are free to explore and find meaning in what is around them. I believe there is so much in this world that is amazingly awesome that its wonder and beauty could only be tainted by creating a myth to explain it. \n\nThanks for reading my story.",

Sorry if that's more convincing evidence than this god claim people keep having. Science always questions itself, but evolution has been arrived from so many angles (DNA, fossils, geologic layers, biochemistry, experimentation, geographic speciation and adaptation, vestigial structures, etc) that you'd have to come up with a better theory before anyone takes you seriously... Einstein did that to disprove Newton's ideas on gravity, momentum, energy, time, and mass. Schrodinger, Planck, and Bohr later disproved Einstein with the birth of quantum theory, which is now so chaotic that theories are feeble at best and horribly misunderstood at worst (double slit is NOT proof of a conscious universe!).

This is probably why it had to be moved to Facebook groups and to target far less savy boomers in order to actually catch on.  Nowadays the only people even posting about Q are chatbots and those who are out of the loop and hear about it on MSM and think it is some actual movement rather than bored boomers and a few depraved charlatans looking for notoriety.\n\nFlat earth started, in modern times, with fringe religious groups; the kind who wear prairie dresses and don't cut their hair. I think the only people who might actually believe it online (aside from those who push it for nefarious purposes) are maybe middleschoolers who have not taken geometry, and the \"holofractal\" set who favor it just to be iconoclastic.  \n\nIMHO, it is just as inane as the recently pass\u00e9 hype about \"we might be in a simulation\" that was just Divine creationism for those who want to claim to be atheist.\n\nI did not realize they actually had some quack snake oil salesmen promoting the piss drinking thing until this thread.  The 4chan stuff was last year at the heigh of \"horse paste\" hysteria as a response to try and get media to earnestly report piss drinking and look even more absurd.  The actual practice of piss drinking for \"health\" comes from the 'crystal power new-age' nonsense.  They have been preaching that one out on the west coast since the 70's.",

The only danger really is that homosexuals tend to be more promiscuous, and at higher risk for std's.  That's my point.\n\nAnd that all should repent and come to a knowledge of the truth!  Jesus will save you from your sins, just ask and believe on Him!  God is good!",

And it's stupidly wrong. \n\nThe problem with it is that there simply isn't enough time for that much evolution to take place. For there to be the amount of diversity there is now, evolution as we know would have to be wrong due to how quickly animals would have to be changing for it to make any sort of sense. \n\nLike the earliest branch from wolves and dogs alone was somewhere between 20,000 to 40,000 thousands years. But for it to make since with the Noah story, dogs branching from wolves, along with all the different breeds of dogs that have descended from the original dog would have all had to have come about in less than 6000 years. And that's just dogs. \n\nEven if you distilled it down to things into \"kinds\" like Ken Ham and similar folks want to call it, such as the canine kind, feline kind, a range of bird kinds, elephant kind, lizard kind, cattle kind, etc, it is still entirely impossible. And not just from evolution, but from just due to the size of the boat. As there are just an overwhelming number of \"kinds\" of animals that exist.",

By your logic, even Trump has things to teach us, but that doesn't mean that we subscribe to the Fascist rights way of thinking just because they do have some good ideas.  Ideally we'd snag those ideas, dump the rest and improve everyones lot.  But I guess that actually helps your point of using valuable lessons from something even if the something is terrible.  I still don't think there's any real deep meaning to those bible stories.  Most \"meaning\" is what modern people have assigned to them.  Look at all the books that claim \"The 50 points prophesy that Jesus fulfilled!\"... and when you do with a critical eye, you realize that, first of all, most of them are vague enough that they've been \"fulfilled\" a bunch of times, or that they weren't fulfilled at all, and that was the book writers wishful thinking.  And this doesn't even get into the obvious issue of the later books in the bible being written later than the earlier books.  So it's easy to write your account from 100 years after Jesus is said to live, read the scrolls from 1000 years or whatever earlier, and write in the fulfilled stuff.",

There is good scriptural and historical evidence that the Flood story is an interpretation of an actual historical event retold in the rhetoric and theology of ancient Israel.\u201d\nSource: https://biologos.org/common-questions/how-should-we-interpret-the-genesis-flood-account/\n\nPlease know that not all Christian\u2019s are blind and naive, unwilling to listen to logic",
