Got more people ribbing my barbell weight than gross looks after switching plus I got out of my own head.  It was a powerful thing dawg, I fully encourage it.  \n\nThe prob is cheap leggings make you crank the waist up high (it slides down).  High end leggings are much thicker.  Both show dem Cammy toes.  Whatcha gonna do tho? Loose fabric will chaif until bleeding.\n\n\nFuck it.  Enjoy my transition from sweat beast to bench yo girl https://i.imgur.com/Mdn6dI3.jpg",
