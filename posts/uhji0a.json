And that\u2019s something that\u2019s most definitely been proven. So maybe if you were a decent human being and asked nicely I could send you the links, but if you\u2019re not willing to educate yourself don\u2019t you dare speak about adoption. Because if you\u2019re not going to educate yourself you have no right to. Too many adoptive children have grown into adults and worked through their trauma to share their stories and share what really happens during adoption for people like you who haven\u2019t even thought to research the effects or research the statistics to sit there and go oh it\u2019s cool being adopted is cool. It\u2019s just disrespectful",

You make it seem like it\u2019s some big savior thing and it\u2019s not. You are probably not adopted and if you are you\u2019re still in the fog. A majority of adoptive people have gotten themselves out of that fog enough to actually do research on it. Now if you take a singular moment out of your day to actually research it maybe you wouldn\u2019t be making insensitive comments like that. It\u2019s not cool to be adopted. It is trauma. It always is. That\u2019s why when you adopt through the system most of the time they want you to put your child in therapy. When you\u2019re filling out the questionnaire for adopting a child they ask you how much you know about the trauma. Because all of the children go through it. Do some research. And don\u2019t try to argue with someone who\u2019s adopted about what happens when you\u2019re adopted. We know what happens. It\u2019s been scientifically proven that when you are adopted something and your brain changes. It is a trauma that you live with no matter what when you\u2019re adopted. It might not be as strong for some as it is for others. Like if you actually have a family that\u2019s decent and knows what they\u2019re doing with adoption it\u2019s usually not as bad. But it\u2019s always there",

I know it\u2019s not usually meant to be as derisive as it sounds, but it\u2019s genuinely galling when you consider the implication of the words people choose for even a moment.\n\nI\u2019ve been a father to my children since they were 2 years and 7 months old respectively.  They were both in a wonderful foster home for about 18 months and we still keep their foster parents in their lives because of the positive impact they had.  Their biological family abused and neglected both of my boys both pre- and post-nataly.  They were in the custody of their birth parents for less than a year between both of them.  My sons are now going on 9 and 7 years old.  I have been present for every step, every smile, every laugh.  I\u2019d like to think I played a role in the cultivation of myriad skills and talents, but both my kids are absurdly special so that might just be wishful thinking on my part.  I\u2019ve changed every dirty diaper, treated every fever, wiped every snotty nose.  I\u2019ve been to every sports practice, parent-teacher conference, swim lesson, drama club rehearsal, and open gym.  I gave up my own personal life goals when COVID happened because one of my sons is high-risk and the idiots in charge of my community couldn\u2019t be bothered to listen to the doctors and scientists telling them how to keep our children safe\u2014so I learned how to homeschool a STEM curriculum at two different levels simultaneously.  And I\u2019m not even mad about it\u2014it\u2019s literally my favorite job ever. \n\nSo it\u2019s like\u2026forgive me if I\u2019m a little perturbed when some stranger in public sees that my sons have a distinctly different skin color and asks who the \u201creal father\u201d is.\n\nMotherfucker, I\u2019M the *real* father.  Does it actually matter who the biological parents were when the sole issue at-hand is your own curiosity?\n\nAnyway.  Thank you for being excellent and enduring my rant.  I wish you all the health and happiness in the world.",

One aspect of that was signing parents up for visitation groups which we will do so by asking for a photo ID to see if they are eligible for the visit (as only legal guardians were the main one to be able so no friends or cousins usually). At times (mainly men) would come up and say \"hey I'm here to visit...I am their adopted/step father\" almost all the time I would say \"nah man, you're the kid's *Father*.\" Some would just smile and we'd go on like normal but I'll never forget this one time it really made this man happy to hear I guess an absolute stranger give him that validation that even if the kid didn't come from him that didn't make him any less than a father. He had teared up a bit and every time after he came to visit he always said he was the kid's father. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've always been in the mindset that the parents aren't always the one who shares the DNA but those who raise, love, care for, and are there for the child.

I am very pro-choice, and, it is fucked to tell someone to carry a child to term and then give that child up for adoption.  \n\nBut its also fucked up to sit here and tell someone they are lazy on the off chance they can't even biologically have kids no matter how hard they try or get denied when trying to adopt.\n\nI have seen that type jealousy first hand eat at someone hard when it comes to this topic.  I have also seen the type of comments they receive that pushes them towards a stance of so wrongfully denying the rights of others.\n\nGetting rid of Roe v Wade is going to fuck shit up for so many people.

There are a few reasons for this, one is that LGBT people recognize the inherent value of kids that are \"outcasts\" like us, but the other is that adoption agencies often gave us \"less desirable\" kids as options since it was okay for inferior people to adopt inferior kids. \n\n\nYet even when we adopt kids with significant emotional and developmental needs, they have the same (or even better) outcomes than when straight parents have their own biological kids and raise them. That's because we not only love the kids we adopt, we have jumped through so many hoops and have spent ages preparing to bring a child into our homes. If conservatives actually cared about kids, they'd read the extensive research about LGBT adoption and think \"how can we get more gay couples to adopt?\" rather than trying to fight against our right to get married and adopt children. It's ironic that many LGBT people seem to value marriage and family more than \"family values\" conservatives.",

Your comment is nothing more than your view as well until supported by sources.\n\nHere's my view of it. Considering the rigorous and frankly ridiculously expensive adoption process it makes perfect sense that a couple choosing that path would not only be well off, but also be a bit older since a certain financial stability generally isn't reached until you grow a bit older.\n They're also not saying an LGBTQ couple would be better off than a straight couple adopting, but seeing as how straight couples can also conceive on their own, they are able to do so while also poor and/or in a bad place while an LGBTQ couple could not. \n\nThus their initial comment makes sense to me.",

And I understand where they\u2019re coming from - research shows that reuniting kids with family tends to have the best outcomes overall for the kids. But what\u2019s also been shown that repeatedly going back to abusive parents and then again back into foster care - usually with a different set of foster parents every time, to prevent the kid from bonding with one set of foster parents and potentially \u2018harming the bond with the bio parent\u2019 - causes huge psychological problems, whereas placing a kid with a safe family sooner can prevent them from developing. So the kid\u2019s mental health is considered secondary to the chance that maybe, just maybe, their parent feels like not harming their child this time. \n\nI understand why they\u2019re focused on family reunion. But when they do it over and over again despite evidence that it is dangerous to the child, and deny them relationships with any other adults, CPS becomes complicit in the abuse. Look at how badly they handled the Gabriel Gonzales case because they were so dead set on reunion.",

But sometimes they just rotate them. Have a kid live in your house for 4 years, then bam, they rip that one from you and give you someone else (I imagine this is because of situation B above).

When communism collapsed in Romania in 1989, an estimated 170,000 children were found warehoused in filthy orphanages.

Other forms of violence usually hurt or kill in a longer time so that there is a chance a person can be saved. Just look at the [homicide rate](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081) of countries compared to gun laws. Then, it's a totally different picture.\n\n>The only positions on abortion that aren't ultimately arbitrary are \"life begins at conception\" and \"life begins at birth\".\r  \nThe idea that a fetus is not a human is the entire crux of the issue and you're acting as though it's settled.\n\nIt's settled in most developed countries, where the right to bodily autonomy, a very important right, is respected. \n\n>Gun regulations just create more black market guns.\n\nThat doesn't matter because it still reduces gun violence and gun homicide by reducing the overall number of people with guns who shouldn't have guns. The purpose of the regulations are still fulfilled, as opposed to abortion restricting laws.\n\n>You know what America doesn't seem to have? Acid attacks.\n\nYou're comparing something that kills 53 people every day to something that injures about 53 per year. I'll leave it at that.\n\nIf you still don't realize how much gun are a very serious problem in the US, just look at the first chart to your right [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence). It's a big problem that other countries don't have.\n\n>It's ok to admit you just don't like guns, you don't have to come up with reasons that conflict with your other moral positions.\n\nI have explained my views.

Most of the rules they preach and things they teach are based solely in the Old Testament (or the portion of the book that originates in Judaism). When you get into the non-denominational side of things, they even rip off many of the rituals of Judaism because they think the more Jewish they act the more spiritual they are. Jesus is the footnote attached to the end of sermons and prayers to give the impression of \u201cChristianity,\u201d while none of the behavior resembles him at all. It\u2019s lip-service theater. \n\nHere\u2019s a fun fact: the English word \u201chypocrite\u201d comes from the Greek word \u201chupokrit\u0113s,\u201d which means \u201cactor.\u201d It\u2019s not just someone who says one thing and does another, it\u2019s someone who acts like they are something they\u2019re not. And then the church dove head first into politics which puts them every further from Christianity, because Jesus told his followers to keep politics out of it. More ironic he also told them to keep away from religion too. Western Christianity is the lethal mixture of both. \ud83d\ude12\n\nBasically it\u2019s a big circus. They don\u2019t do what Jesus would do because they don\u2019t actually follow him. But they can compensate for that internal dilemma by forcing the rules they break onto somebody else.

Then drop her sweet innocent daughter off at home to recover from the totally necessary abortion, and drive 40 miles to a Motel 8 to suck & fuck her best friend's husband.\n\nThat wasn't a hypothetical, that's a 100% true story of my childhood neighbor. When I was a freshman in HS, her innocent sweetheart daughter who was a junior started sneaking out at night and climbing in my bedroom window to suck my dick. No pussy, no oral reciprocation, she just wanted to suck me off. After 3 months of that she wanted to start doing anal, and we tried and it was a disgusting mess because neither of us knew what we were doing because our school taught Abstinence Only Sex Ed. So we went back to her just sucking me off until she got a boyfriend after she graduated and went to college. While she had that boyfriend she went to a party in which her and 5 other girls took turns fucking half the college baseball team (no shame, get that dick!) and she ended up pregnant. So her mom took her to get an abortion. She would have 2 more abortions by the time she was 25. She told me all about it. Now she's married to that very same 1st and only boyfriend she cheated on with half a baseball team and the two other guys who got her pregnant before marriage. They have 4 great kids and she is hardcore Pro-Life just like her cheating mother. \n\nRed States are wild.",

She couldn\u2019t handle a second and had no relationship with the birth father (a hookup situation is what we were told). \n\nThe mother found us through an online service that allows mothers to choose prospective families to adopt their child.  \n\nThe boy we adopted is a joy.  He is so expressive and lovable.  He says he wants to be a preacher.  He scored his first soccer goal of the season last night and was beaming. \n\nThe mother of our adopted daughter was single with three other children.  She had gotten established with a house and a job at a factory while her 3 other children were in school.  She felt like her life was just beginning to thrive when she became pregnant with a guy from work that wasn\u2019t interested in a relationship or raising a child.  The mother has since met and become engaged to another man and continues to thrive with her family. \n\nOur adopted daughter is a sweet little girl. She is not quit two, but already coming into her own.  She has a \u201ctwin\u201d brother who is our biological son. They are the same age and have grown up together all but a day or two of their lives. \n\nThey were doing the sweets thing running up and kissing on each other the other night.  They would giggle and fall down with their arms wrapped around each other.  \n\nI can\u2019t help but think that an abortion provider would have gladly terminated both these childrens\u2019 lives and called it a success story for these mothers.  \n\nI\u2019ve heard many accounts of the emotional trauma associated with the procedure and the remorse mothers carry for years.  \n\nAdoption is a great alternative and there are many families hoping to adopt children of all backgrounds and conditions",

They should not have to choose between taking care of their newborn and going to work.\n\nThird - Childcare needs to be covered. It shouldn't cost you anything to have to actually have your child cared for while you go out and work to provide for them.\n\nI'm sure there's more, but here's a start. If having a child before you're financially ready wasn't a direct path into the poor house, more people would be willing to carry to term and the children would be better off for it.",

If you didn\u2019t intend to get pregnant, then \u201cwell\u2026 it won\u2019t bankrupt us\u201d is not sufficient reason to bring another life into this world.\n\nI agree that the goal should be fewer abortions, but the best method to achieve that is to prevent unwanted/unintended pregnancies in the first place. Birth control should be free, and freely available. Better, safer, and more reliable methods of birth control should always be under development. Sex education is crucial, as is education in general, so that shared responsibility is a given, whether that responsibility is prevention or parenting.\n\nNote that all this is assuming that every situation consists of two willing, responsible participants\u2026 which is absolutely not the case, nor is every intentional pregnancy safe to carry to term for mother and/or child. There are reasons for abortion other than accidental pregnancy, which cannot be ignored.",

We aren't done \"cooking\" just because we popped out of the womb.  Our brain, nerves and other parts of our physiology are still forming until age six.  If you were raised in a traumatic environment, you are hard wired to have PTSD your entire life.  When you can identify the way your PTSD manifests and correlate it to how you were raised, you can begin finally taking control over your own life instead of letting it control you.  It's not just learned behavior.  There's an actual physical issue going on.  Trauma is so insidious because it's easy to think we somehow, as adults, should be able to overcome it on our own.  If you think of it as a combination of child abuse (you wouldn't expect a child to just suck it up an move on so give yourself the same permission) and a physical illness (you wouldn't expect a diabetic to just suck it up and move on, either), you can then start making real movement toward having a calm mind.\n\nYou are not bad.  You are not crazy.  You have real value.  Now we just need to convince your brain of this and you'll be all set (or at least a whole, whole lot better).",

Asking 50 random people on the street if they want to adopt and then extrapolating the data to the size of America wouldn't be an ethical way to conduct this survey/study and you know it (this is hypothetical since none of the articles say how they got the numbers or even link to any studies). \n\nSo a well-documented scientific study, preferably one that is peer-reviewed to weed out poor analyses, is definitely needed. Only then can arguments be made based on the environmental or societal biases of the study on whether the figure shown accurately reflects the entirety of the USA.\n\nTo paint an easier picture, imagine this: I go to several different Chinatowns throughout USA and tally the races of the local population. I then put out a headline that says 'USA is predominantly Chinese'. Based on my numbers, I would be correct. But in a scientific study, I would get blasted for doing the study only in Chinatowns. That's the difference of a random survey and a scientific study.",

Now, they want to force women to give birth to kids against their will, increasing supply.\n\nSo Republicans, who worship the free market, are in favor of creating a MASSIVE surplus of unwanted children and DECREASING the demand by severely limiting those who are even allowed to adopt.\n\nGreat work, everyone. Now everyone has fewer rights, less autonomy, and over-inflated supply of unwanted children with little to no assistance in form of healthcare, childcare, and funding for public schools.",

There is an extensive and expensive process that needs to be done before this is done, because you know these are actual people we're determining their entire future for. and the state is paying for the children during that entire time.\n\nThis doesn't even get into the fact that a majority of adoptees refuse to adopt those with disabilities (something abortion drastically cuts down on, since you wouldn't be forced to give birth to a horribly deformed person you may not be emotionally or financially stable enough to handle) And also not all adoptees want newborn babies. Some are looking to adopt toddlers, young children or even pre-teens.\n\nAnd again, this is all stuff that needs EXTENSIVE funding in order to keep children from suffering.

Also as a second time, planned pregnant person - being pregnant is really physically difficult and that's nothing on giving birth. Fuck these bitches. Or actually don't.",

I mean if its because they arent adopting any its probably because they cant afford to adopt/get any more kids, because they wanted to experience the whole biological child thing (which i think is fine), or because they cant afford to adopt a child (now i dont know much about the process of adoption, or how much it costs, if at all). \n\nId say being for adoption but not having adopted any is fine right? Now remember, im for adoption, im just really confused why they get hated on so much because they said they are for adoption but have kids. So please dont hate me.\n\nEdit: wait, yall hating on them because of the \"I have children of my own\", yeah i understand now, I missed thats, makes total sense.

Generally speaking, people want to pretend the solutions to complex problems are overly simplistic, and they don't have the work ethic to actually do anything that promotes actual change. They just like complaining and pretending to be morally superior without any substance to back it up. It's just an attention seeking ego looking for validation. Does that describe you? I certainly don't know. You're an absolute stranger to me. The kind of person you are doesn't actually effect me in any way.\n\n\n\nNot everything is a trick. You expressed a desire to help children.

Had the host never sewed it on in the first place, it would have died anyways\n\nThat is an interesting point but it's not that the person would've died without you, it's that they would have never existed without you starting the process in the first place.  This may not change your final answer but I think it's an important distinction to make.  Your wording still attempts to absolve the mother for any responsibility for the other person's predicament.  \n\n>and apparently nobody would even care, because this \"person\" wasn't aware of it's surroundings, didn't even have a name or an identity.\n\nI believe name/identity is as irrelevant as SSN for the purpose of this thought experiment.  You keep trying to pigenhole it into a conversation about legal \"murder\" when I don't believe i used that term (maybe).  Even so, if you intentionally kill a pregnant woman you get charged for two murders so I don't see the point of this.\n\nBeing aware of its surroundings is a kind of interesting point.  It would be similar to if the person attached was \"braindead\", but there is an important distinction that the person being sewed will recover within 9 months, something the person knew before doing the sewing.\n\nAlso, what's the difference between a baby a minute before or a minute after being \"born\"...does the latter have a different awareness of their surroundings?  So this \"awareness\" justification would allow the killing of newborns.\n\n>So again, for the third time, not murder.  You can keep asking the question, you're going to keep getting the same answer.\n\nI'd consider this the first real answer to my question, which appreciate, although the issues I presented may or may not compel you to re-think some of your rationale.",

If you somehow actually don't understand why, let me inform you: it's because adopting a newborn and adopting an older kid are two completely different things. Saying \"if you want to adopt a kid, why not get an older one that's been waiting longer?\" Is a literal strawman. \n\nThey've developed a lot. Commonly in a lot of difficult ways. It's not the kid or the adult's fault. The unfortunate reality is that being an adopted parent to an older kid doesn't even begin to compare to a newborn. \n\nTons of people want to adopt because they can't have kids or want to provide newborns of people who'd otherwise abort them with a home. Both of those are likely a lot more noble than you, me, or anyone else in these comments. \n\nNot sure how you guys try to take some kind of moral high ground over someone willing to step in and help just because said person is also able to recognize their limits and just isn't up to the completely different challenge that is raising an older adopted kid.\n\nThe real confidently incorrect people here is anyone who thinks the kids currently available to adopt have even a shred of relevance in this particular issue. I wish they did. But they don't. And there's a perfectly rational explanation as to why.",

Or you could foster and fall in love with a child in a couple years and get your heart torn out of your chest when their incapable parent gets out of prison. Foster care prioritizes parental rights.\n\nThe good news is that healthy newborns are in really high demand.\n\nI do like even if there are some misconceptions floating around that this is even a discussion.

At least she would be attempting to practice what she preaches.\n\nThat being said, I feel like there was something off with how she answered all happily with a big smile. It could just be my unconscious bias judging this person, but it's almost as if she was lying and this is a rehearsed answer she has ready to go for people who ask that question. Or, she barely tried to adopt one time in the past and put a minimum effort forward, it didn't work out immediately, and now she can use that for the rest of her life to say, \"hey look I'm not a hypocrite!\". I feel like people who genuinely give a shit and actually want to adopt children but can't for whatever reason are not that happy and bubbly about it. Like she could at least pretend she was a little sad about the fact that she wasn't able to adopt. Idk maybe I'm reading too much into this two second interaction. She could just be smiley because she feels awkward and that's just how some people handle awkwardness. I dunno.",

They are definitely uber religious and I still am curious how their views impact the children, but from the last time I hung out with them they had the mindset of love the sinner, hate the sin, and Jesus hung out with sinners and loved them so they did too.

She said she would agree if I would sign a document not seeking child support... ever!! The mom's only incentive to raise him was low income housing and welfare benefits. I remember when he was like 2 and a half. He got his first high fever. His mom was staying at her aunt's. And I called the house phone about 930  and left a message that her son was being admitted to children's for a serious case of flu and he had a feverall seizure. His temp shot from a 100 to a 104 in minutes. Caused a seizure. They cussed me out the next day for calling so late\ud83d\ude0f  She lived less than 3 miles from him most of his life. Bouncing from abusive drunks to drunks. He's never spent the night with her. She gave him $20 for his birthday once. The rare phone call. Now he's 16 and has been working and making excellent grades while taking home school classes. He saved up $10,000 from his first summer job and paid for his own D&D driving school. And last week bought his first car with cash. 2014 Chevy Malibu. Now his mom works with him at wal mart and is acting like they're real close. I can tell he wants to know her better. But I'm afraid he's setting his self up for a heartbreak. She's been trying to borrow money and bum rides from him. She is a user. But I also feel like a heel when I try n tell him. I don't like bad mouthing her to him. I think it upsets him. What to do?",

If you haven't adopted or even tried to adopt a child then do not go around telling people to just put babies up for adoption. And it can be traumatizing to carry a baby to term just to put it up for adoption. The whole entire fucking point is quit telling women what to do with their bodies.

That's not what we're saying at all.\n\nWhat we're saying is\n\nYou want children who can't be taken care of to be born but don't care about what happens to them after they've left the womb.\n\nThere is already a problem with children growing up in the system.\n\nYour solution is to create more children who will end up being wards of the state.\n\nIf you want to stop something and suggest something different, then start fixing the problem that you want to make worse FIRST.\n\n>Are you against world hunger? Before you answer, know I'm going to ask you to donate everything of value you have. If you don't donate all your things then you don't really care about world hunger\n\nLmfao gotta love the straw man argument...\n\n\"Expecting me to adopt ONE child is the exact same as expecting you to donate everything of value you have and if you don't, you're a hypocrite\" \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02",
