The sheer amount of FLAK I caught from supposedly \"don't tread on me\" types was astounding. How DARE I not stand and mumble the lines in whatever class we were in. The old dude who taught  music history was especially pissed and tried to use me as an example of \"what's wrong with America's youth today\".

Unless the cause of the disorder is avowed white supremacists, then they somehow always manage to side with the law instead of with order.\n\nAlso, don't believe for a second that cointel was stopped when MLK was assassinated. Police have trainings on how to pose as protesters in order to start shit. One of their arms dealers recently put on a presentation at a law enforcement symposium for a \"tactical backpack\" that allows them to pretend to be a protester and within seconds have a bulletproof vest and assault rifle at the ready.  Not to mention the undercover officers in Philly that charged several protesters with assaulting officers when they were pretending to be protesters lighting fires and breaking windows and the crowd stopped them.\n\nFFS, Chicago PD was found to be operating several off the books black sites where they'd take \"suspects\" and beat the shit out of them to get confessions before actually booking them, and the entire country took their word, without any evidence, that two undocumented immigrants out of nowhere, with no pressure, just walked up and said a hate crime was really a publicity stunt. They can freely admit to lying and corruption one day, and the next the entire country just takes them at their word. They think they can get away with this shit because the country jumps at the chance to let them get away with this shit.",
