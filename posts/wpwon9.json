There\u2019s lots of wonderful gentle sleep tracks when they grow from newborn to help them sleep. \n\nBut more importantly, don\u2019t lose track of each other. Keep in mind that anything you\u2019re upset about is not  the thing. It\u2019s sleep deprivation and / or all the newness of this parenting time. Keep a reminder on a mirror or somewhere - we\u2019re a team. \n\nThese are the years where resentments, nitpicking, and misunderstanding can grab hold. These years are profoundly important spiritual ones for people and partners. They\u2019re there to deepen mature love, and patience. And be gentle on yourself and her. You\u2019re \u201cin the trenches.\u201d You\u2019ll come out profoundly changed to something even more fundamentally real, humor-filled and fun, and good, and feel a sense of esteem from what you\u2019ve built. \n\nFinally, wherever you can, give a whole lot to cleaning, cooking, caring for the baby. Give her a whole day off. Take a whole day for yourself. You\u2019ll find intimacy much more likely when you\u2019ve made a lot of space for it. Hope I didn\u2019t scare you too much lol.",

MIL helps during the day, but I'm alone with them during the night. Fortunately, the younger one already started sleeping for longer than 2-3 hours during the night, and the eldest sleeps through the night since he was two and a half months old. There was a period, though, when I was loosing my mind from the sleep deprivation, but, it didn't last long thankfully. Here are some tips to help during the first year: when you get up to feed the baby during the night, try to do it without turning the lights on (I use a lamp and keep it at the side of the room opposite to the bed); while I get that having a separate room for a baby is common in the USA, where I'm from, the crib goes in the room where the mom sleeps as it's much easier during the night - sometimes, if the baby is fussy but still sleeping, I don't even need to get out of bed, I just find her pacifier (I keep it on the night stand as she spits it out when she falls asleep, that night stand is the only thing between my bed and her crib), and put it in her mouth and she calms almost instantly; I can't say this loud enough - PACIFIER IS YOUR BEST FRIEND. I brought one into the hospital when I went to give birth, and pretty much started giving it to her from the first day. Do everything to make it easier on you and your partner, of course within reason. Make sure that your partner has something to eat and drink at any given moment because, if she's breastfeeding, she'll get really hungry and thirsty really quickly and often. Look out for signs of depression. Another useful thing to remember during the night - if there isn't a need to change the diaper (the baby didn't poop) don't do it. I change my baby before I put her down for the night and then in the morning, before the first feed. This is because you want your baby to stay sleepy, and changing them basically kills the sleepiness. These are the things I learned with my first one, and now with the second it's pretty much a breeze. Enjoy your baby and be there for your partner, she'll need a lot of love and support.",

Since I am hearing impaired and didn't have my hearing aid on while in his room due to dressing out for COVID (excessive perspiration made HA slip off or get static sounds). As I stepped closer to his bed to have him repeat his question, this is what I heard: The sound after Ralphie Parker knocked off his glasses and nearly shot his eye out with \"The official Red Ryder carbine action, 200-shot, range model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time\u201d then stepped forward on the snow to find his glasses but instead landed on...... \"Yep. They're right under my shoe.\" Then I had to call his wife and tell her. \"No problem. Those are his OLD glasses, I'll bring in his new pair.\" Merry Christmas to me.",

When my kids were little, I tried to open the non existent rear door of my friend\u2019s Miata, when he baby sat with our minivan, and we took the sports car on a date.  But, one day I couldn\u2019t find the 6mos old 4th kid who I was carrying, until my 8yr old eased my panic, by telling me I had him!\n\nYou can also tell your spouse  to unbuckle the toddler, you have the groceries, while spouse calls to you to get the toddler, he has the shoe bags, and neither heard the other, and was confident the other had the child.  I *knew* this happened. So I taught husband and my tween to be paranoid.  I tell this to new parents all the time, to help prevent tragedies while being non judgmental and pragmatic about the exhaustion.",

Thirty minutes and a cup of coffee later, you wake up enough to remember that your partner had a dental appointment and you were supposed to drop off at daycare this one time. But it's July. Too late.\n\nI suspect the vilification of these parents only serves to make these accidents more common. If you think only negligent monsters make this mistake then you don't employ the redundant safeguards against what you think could never happen to you.",

I was also in a magnet program I guess you'd call it that put all the kids above a certain percentile on a standardized test together in one class for accelerated learning, so we got bussed all around the city before and after school. My stop was at another elementary school near my house, but I got dropped off after the admin left. So I was just standing outside on a cold day in the rain for like 40 minutes before my dad pulled up.  \n\nApparently he jumped out of the bath like he got hit by lightning once he realized he fucked up.

A developer buys a plot of farmland, flattens it to maximize the building space, cuts it up into evenly divided lots, and sells it to a builder, like NVR, (Ryan homes) or Taylor Morison, or both. \n\nThe customer chooses a Base model, and then option to their heart\u2019s content. Some options must come with a package; similar to choosing trim on a car. If I want marble countertops, it must include the premium bathroom sinks.\n\nThe design and layout of the bedrooms are part of the options, but the master usually stays put. It\u2019s a big portion, includes a full bathroom and a walk-in closet. Most architects design the master, away from other living spaces, maybe a laundry room next to the master.\n\nI\u2019m one of millions of these customers.",

If you prefer only ever wearing shoes while driving that is demonstrably fine. But don't say not doing what you specifically do is more dangerous. It's dumb shit coming from a dumb shit.",

He forgot that the baby was still asleep in the backseat. So he went to work. \n\nHours later his wife goes to the daycare to pick up the baby who was never dropped off. That\u2019s when he remembers. But it was too late.",

If we told each other to get the kid out of the car, we always verified the other *heard* us.  (Each person thinking the other got them out is one scenario).  I used to have a recurring nightmare of being on the highway with the wrong number of kids in the car, when some were in preschool, some elementary school, and I had a carpool.\n\nNow, with a just a service dog (kids grown up), I have muscle memory for getting the dog out.

Finding my second kid at three years old burning my work shirt with a hot iron after I went to take a quick pee. Telling my second kid to go fetch our football out of a neighbors garden only to have their pitbull come running out ready to \"play\", and have to hop the fence myself to quickly retrieve my kid. \n\nDon't feel guilty. We're the lucky ones. \n\nThis happens to literally every parent. The reason I don't understand the hot car one is that it is so prevalent, just like the barbecue in your tent thing it's so common I assumed everyone was super careful. I live in Vietnam and it's always hot here, hot car is a risk here so severe that the minute you turn off your engine the car starts to bake. It starts to feel stifling almost straight away. \n\nYou know it's weird, when I spoke to my grandmother about my own guilt she called me weird. But said that in the past parents weren't blamed for everything that happened their kid. Kid gets killed in a preventable accident? Well it happens and is unfortunate was her attitude but kids are stupid and seem to intentionally try to kill themselves at every opportunity so there's a lot of luck involved raising kids and sometimes the worst luck happens. Theses days the first thing people say \"where were the parents, what were the parents doing?\" Kid becomes a serial killer? Oh it's the parent's fault. \n\nFor her she thought we have it too \"easy\" now and child mortality rates so low due to vaccines and other medical advances that kids dying is not so common anymore. My grandmother had a cot death kid, and said as a parent nearly every year she was going to the funeral of a kid through disease or accident, no one ever questioned the parents. In her mind she thinks because it's no longer as common that kids die young everyone focuses on the parents like it's their fault. Just because something is preventable doesn't mean it was anyone's fault when it happens.",
