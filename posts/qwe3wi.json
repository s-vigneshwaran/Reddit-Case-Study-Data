Given that environment, some social media grifters have managed to get themselves repeated airtime through sheer willingness to say anything to raise their profile. \n\nOf course British liberalism is obsessed with \u201cdefeating intolerance in the marketplace of ideas\u201d, so there\u2019s a lot of blame there in the failure to call out this shit over the last decade or so. Even today they\u2019ll cite leader of white nationalist BNP Nick Griffin\u2019s appearance on question time as a resounding success because the BNP are no longer a political force. This carefully ignores the fact many BNP supporters transferred to slightly more suit-and-tie white nationalist party UKIP, and the country voted to leave the EU based on many of the same white nationalist talking points Griffen was allowed to air on national television. \n\nSorry for the long post, this subject gets my goat!",

Not sure when it started, but after becoming an adult and my kids going into sports, the anthem is now played before any event starts. One tournament they didn't have someone to sing it or had it recorded, so they asked everyone in the gymnasium to say the pledge of allegiance. It was really weird. I am happy that I am American, proud of some things and of course critical of our past and present issues, but I will never understand the pledge before school and the anthem before all sporting events now. Seems so indoctrination-y for a nation that is *supposedly* about individualism and freedom.
