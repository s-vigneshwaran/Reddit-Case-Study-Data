Finland is an interesting comparison due to their comparatively restrictive gun laws, examples are that it doesn't allow guns with capacities of over 10 bullets in the chamber, only giving guns when there's valid reason (hunting, sports, etc.), licenses can only be issued on a per-gun basis, etc.\n\nDue to these restrictions it makes it very hard to get the type of weaponry needed to make something like what has been happening in the US a consistent issue. After they had problems with school shooters (two comparatively minor cases, but still large news) in 2008 & 2008 they made regulations making it much tougher to acquire the types of weapons used in those shootings as well. Again, in comparison the US has... Stuck to it's guns (for the pun, haha) in terms of ease of access to these sorts of firearms. There's also the comparison of open and concealed carry, which in the US is legal depending on the state, while in Finland it's absolutely not legal, and if you do have a firearm, it must be unloaded.\n\nNow I'm not saying that we face the same issues as Finland, Finland is surrounded by restrictive gun control, and so it's even harder to get illegal weapons in and out of the country. On the other hand, the US has Mexico on the border, which could potentially be bringing more weapons in and out of the country than we know about. I'm not saying immigrants, but illegal shit happens at that border all the time due to government corruption and lack of oversight, guns would absolutely not surprise me.",

Same with Switzerland, another high guns, low murder country.  And Norway, next on the list after Switzerland for high gun ownership.\n\nThe thing I consistently notice is that the countries with high gun ownership and no problem with it are all much more \"communist\" places to live than America.  Better social security, less inequality, better job security and workers rights, etc...\n\nAnd similar countries to them that don't have guns also have that same low murder rate.\n\nBut countries that are more like America (capitalist hellholes) tend to have a higher murder rate whether or not they have a high number of gun owners.\n\nAll I can conclude from that is that gun access really doesn't effect murder rate all that much, compared to things like social security, inequality, education quality, job security, workers rights, etc...",

The same racial and sexual minorities that right wing America has been priming itself to fucking murder by the millions for the last 60 years at least.\n\nSee you say that, but my solution would actually stop this shit. Ensuring access to healthcare, education, food, and housing would so drastically improve the socioeconomic conditions that foster gun violence. Admittedly it's harder to tackle the white supremacy, misogyny, and toxic masculinity that have been showing in all the mass shootings with policy, but the socioeconomic conditions alone would vastly lower gun violence across the board.\n\nBecause people are products of their environment, and people in health environments where they have options don't fucking do this shit.\n\nAnd for the record, background checks would be totally fine once you tackle the systemic racism policing has fostered and given proper oversight. You'd also need to reconcile the many people who are swept up in over policing that would otherwise have gotten a pass if they were a suburban white kid but now have to carry a record around for the rest of their life.",

Are your windows shatterproof?

It's big, it's unwieldy, it's probably in another room somewhere, and if you miss, which you will at least a few times there's a not zero chance it goes through the bedroom wall and hits little Timmy.\n\nIf you want a shotgun for home defense I still think you're being paranoid, but no one's talking about shotgun regulation. If you want a pistol in your purse for self defense I'm going to tell you it's a bad idea but hey, we aren't banning pistols any time soon.

This isn't the 1800s when traveling 50 miles was a multiple day trip on horseback.\n\nIt doesn't matter if your windows are shatterproof, if you can kick in the doors, etc. If a criminal has a car or a sledgehammer, all of that is irrelevant. Even if you live in a brick fortress with very tough doors and windows, youtube channels like lockpicking lawyer have demonstrated how the majority of locks out there can be easily bypassed with minor effort.\n\nWith the comment about \"you don't need an AR-15 for home defense\", it's true that you don't really need that and AR-15s are mostly for recreational shooting or competitions. A shotgun is significantly better than an AR-15 for home defense, however something like a slug in a shotgun hits way harder than you could ever hope to do with a 5.56mm bullet out of an AR-15, even something like buckshot hits with pretty brutal results. If we're not going to ban shotguns that are more dangerous than AR-15s, then why would it make sense to ban an AR-15?",

Remember, that gun doesn't do any good if you aren't home, so do you really think someone is going to be doing all that, or picking your locks, while you are home?\n\nThat's the thing about the ZOMG home defense crowd: You imagine these impossible scenarios that are so astronomically unlikely to happen. Like someone is going to drive 45 minutes to your house, break down the siding with a sledgehammer, all while you are home, to kill you while stealing your TV... Does that seem like a reasonable fear to you?\n\nBut again, I conceded that point, so I don't know why you are arguing it.\n\n> If we're not going to ban shotguns that are more dangerous than AR-15s, then why would it make sense to ban an AR-15?\n\nBecause shotguns aren't the weapon of choice for gunning down grade school kids. If prove to be an effective option for shooting lots of third graders we can revisit the issue.\n\nLook, just for the record I almost certainly own more guns than you do. I know what they are, I know what they do, and it's not like I'm some knee jerk reactive anti-gun zealot. \n\nBut that's because I like shooting at the range. Not because I think I'm going to get in a life or death shootout. They are a hobby. No more. If they outlaw guns I'll build birdhouses or something.",

They're both just as capable of killing. Your statistic is like saying Americans are rich because in 2019 the average net worth of American families was $746,820. But it's not really accurate because it's skewed upwards because of the 1%. A more accurate representation is median wealth of American families, which was $121,760. It's a huge difference.\n\nUnfortunately, median doesn't really work well for gun ownership for two reasons (The median number of guns owned in America per person is 0). Not everyone owns a gun, and it's effectively a binary since again, we don't care how many guns people own. The best statistic is either % of people owning guns, or % of households that own a gun, which in my opinion, is the most relevant statistic.\n\nI think it's the most relevant because while it doesn't go into numbers and households can be all different sizes, it gives you a decent idea of how many people have potential access to a gun. John Doe could have a gun registered to himself, but that doesn't stop his son Dave from finding the keys and taking the gun to shoot up a school. I think using both % of Americans who own guns and % of households that have guns gives us the best idea. It gives us a good idea of how many people own guns, and how many people have access to guns. But your statistic of guns per capita is next to useless.",
