You grow up through a time of social change. You have progressive people on one side and non progressive on the other. The non progressive are mostly older.\n\nAs you age the older generation dies out and gives the younger one the opportunity to implement the changes they want to see.\n\nThus you succeed in creating progress. After that you're in your 40s and haven't been exposed to the social issues that the newer generations have and therefore fight for so you don't give them as much priority\n\nThus you become the Conservative simply because you have achieved the progress you sought to achieve in your youth and don't feel as strongly about the new progress.\n\nI dislike when people say you become Conservative as you get older. Ithibk it's more like, you stop fighting for a cause because you don't need to anymore and now you have wealth to live on so there is no need to attack the system as much.\n\nIn reality what has happened is society has shifted and what you now would call progressive young people would call Conservative. \n\nIt's not like as soon as you hit a certain age you flip your political opinions and start voting the opposite of hoe you have in the past. Suddenly you don't think gay marriage and collective responsibility are bad and therefore not worthy of consideration.\n\nSo I dislike this notion because I see it as untrue and people who like to validate their toxic ideas throw it around to try and make themselves feel \"mature\" when in reality they're on the wrong side of the social change wave in their youth.",

Everything doesn\u2019t deserve a fight and everyone\u2019s problems doesn\u2019t need to be announced. People don\u2019t have to compete over how far down society has trampled them and we don\u2019t need to put people in the identifying boxes solely based on skin color and gender.\n\nFor me, and many of my \u201cconservative\u201d friends, it\u2019s not that we entirely disagree with the goal, we just don\u2019t agree on the solution, and don\u2019t think giving the government more control/power/money is the best way to achieve the solution. I think that\u2019s where age and experience come in to play. As a young man that was clueless as to how the world worked, It was much easier to have these ideas of utopia and great social change; to criticize the current way. As I grew up and came to realize that many problems are much more complicated and people much more nuanced, I realized that it\u2019s often times not quite as easily done as it is said.",

I'm telling you to look up the source for yourself because it doesn't exist, which is a consequence of your claim being incorrect.  But you shouldn't even have to look it up anyway; just stop to think about it for a second.\n\nIf your common sense doesn't lead you to reason that your claim is ridiculous (which wouldn't surprise me, since your reasoning ability seems to be a bit off), then let's do some math.  Only 20,000,000 people without high school diplomas voted in the 2020 election.  I can't find good data on who those people voted for, but let's say that *all* of them voted for Trump (which is of course statistically impossible).  Even if that were the case, that would mean that only about 25% of Trump voters didn't have high school diplomas, not 80%.  End of the debate right there.  \n\nBut the reality is that nowhere near all of the voters without high school diplomas voted for Trump.  Yes, a lot of uneducated people voted for Trump, but remember that there are also massive demographic groups that overwhelmingly voted for Biden who have low levels of education attainment.  Specifically, low income urban voters overwhelmingly went for Biden, and they have some of the lowest rates of high school graduation of anyone.\n\nSo let's be conservative and say that two thirds of voters without high school diplomas voted for Trump.  That would put us at only about 15% of Trump voters not having high school diplomas.  A far cry from your ridiculous 80% figure.\n\nBut go ahead, complain that I'm asking you for a source.  You could have just done this research on your own.  Do you have a high school diploma?  You're sure not acting like you do.",

Steve and Edie recorded a song called \"Happy Holidays\" in 1965, and it was part of the Christmas album my family played every year.   By inventing a fake history and a bullshit controversy, right wing media has tainted the best part of Christmas,  which isn't shopping and consumerism,  it's wishing your neighbors well, just because they're your neighbors.  Now it's a political choice.  Now I have to stop and think.    Fox News did this to us, and they did it for terrible reasons.  They did it for viewers, and for ad revenue, and to elect more Republicans so Rupert Murdoch could pay less taxes.  \n\nI've always said \"Merry Christmas\", but starting next year, I believe that my traditional holiday greeting will be a two parter: \"Merry Christmas; Fuck Bill O'Reilly\".   I'm going to have cards printed up.",

You blocked that guy but we all know he'll be in your head rent free lmao. Not the other way around. \n\nYour response to them is you don't know anything so I'm not going to argue.

Actually funny before realizing it's sad.",

It's just that Democrats actually can open a book and learn something new while Republicans hear something their brother-uncle told them once years ago and fight new information tooth & nail till the death of them.
