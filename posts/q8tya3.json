  "text": "TIFU by telling my girlfriend to \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on the condom she pulled out of her drawer\nObligatory this didn\u2019t happen today, but about 8 or so years ago.\n\nMy sophomore year of high school I was dating a girl I met on the swim team. She and I seemed to hit it off pretty quick and all was good. I was over at her place one day and we were watching a movie together. Her grandfather that she lived with at the time came in to let us know he was running to the store and would be back in about 45 minutes. Around that same time, her sister let us know she was leaving to go hang out with her boyfriend, leaving the two of us utterly alone. We\u2019re sitting there just watching the movie when she says she\u2019s a little warm and takes her shirt off, so she\u2019s just there in her sweatpants and bra. I\u2019m a virgin at this rate so I\u2019m trying to pretend that that didn\u2019t give me the world\u2019s fastest boner and act like it\u2019s totally nothing. She then decides her sweatpants are a little warm and takes those off too, all the while, I\u2019m pretending to not notice. \n\nNow I\u2019ll be honest here, I legit had no clue what was going on. I was raised to be very very respectful and never assume women are hinting at something, because after all, it was a little warm in there. We\u2019re cuddled up on this sofa, her half naked, when she gets up, walks over to her drawer, and whips out a condom. She walks over to me and goes \u201cSoooo, I have a condom.\u201d to which I reply \u201cOh, cool. Why?\u201d And she says \u201cWell, you never know when you\u2019re going to need one.\u201d then I say \u201cOh fair point. Well keep an eye on it! Those things expire, you know!\u201d She paused for a few moments, then said \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have it long enough to expire.\u201d and I go \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d. She just stares at me, dumbfounded, and I stare back, still painfully unaware of what\u2019s going on. She puts it back, throws her clothes back on and we finish the movie. She broke up with me about a week later\u2026.\n\nTL;DR: half naked girlfriend told me about her condom and I told her to keep an eye on it in case it expires.\n\nEDIT: Some people are saying this is fake because no one can possibly be this oblivious, and honestly, I can\u2019t blame you. That being said, this really is a 100% true story. What you all have to understand is that I was homeschooled until high school and lived in the middle of nowhere with no neighbors, and therefore, I had next to no social interaction. I quite literally had no idea how to interact with people, lol.",

She had her legs tucked in as kids often do on the bus, and started bragging to me about how firm her butt was. She told me to touch it to see. The other girl in her grade sitting across from us noticed this and urged me to not touch her butt because it would be inappropriate. Ok well im legit 11 and have no impulse control. I poke her butt with my index finger out of pure unrestrained lust, despite all warning not to. After all...she gave me permission.\n\nFast forward to highschool and my gf breaks up with me because I'd always ask her to stop touching me during class and wouldnt return the favor to her. -sigh-",

Assault would be if then, in either of the situations, the receiver says or implies they're actually not up for it, but the giver pushes on. \n\nOr assault would be if you do the first part withba rando from the street with no further context. (Or even worse, if you do it to an employee or someone over whom you have economical power, like the Trump case -- although that case is even clearer because he openly admits that he doesn't care whether she wanted it or not.)",

I can still remember being so shocked that I just did what she said without thinking, not that I was going to complain anyway I was only 18 and she was only the 3rd I been with and not to bad looking But what I remember the most is her tits to this day.  But ya that was the first and only time In my life where a women was that direct.  Other than that though missed so many hints and opportunities that I look back on with much regret.  But there where other times where I just went for it fully expecting to be shot down and got really lucky.  So I guess what I'm saying is don't be afraid to ask and try your luck you just never know what a women is thinking at any give in moment.  That last bit is the only words of wisdom my old man passed on and the older I've gotten the truer it seems to be.  No offence meant ladies.  I would not have it any other way.

While we were on our way back to her place after eating dinner, and I obviously said yes! Lol. After that we dated for a few more months then I made her my gf. She says she like me when we were teens but since I didn\u2019t flirt back she thought I just wanted to be friends lol. So don\u2019t feel too bad about it OP.

We went over there and she invited us into her room and said her pc couldn't connect to the internet. I forgot what the issue was but it was something I solved in like 1 minute of being there and I thought it was kind of ridiculous to call us over for it.\n\nBoth of the girls are sitting on the bed and her friend says, I need to change for bed now and I say OK, sorry, and I get up to leave the room.\n\nShe said no it's okay, you don't have to leave, just don't look over here and winks at me. My gf was giggling and not phased by this seemingly random series of events. \n\nI was confused and thought this was all some elaborate ruse by my gf at the time to test my commitment or something. So she's getting butt ass naked and I literally just looked away while my gf and her were giggling.\n\nI forgot what happened after that, but it wasn't a threesome. We went home.",

(Spoilers friendship ended anyways). When I realized what I did, I tried restarting it. My dad and her dad were drinking buddies. But at that point, it was too late and she moved on.\n\nThe last one was I wad friends with a couple of girls in college and one friend was interested in me and the other knew it and told me. We hung out and taking it slow. I invited her to the Halloween dance, asked her to dance, she did, and I asked her out. What she told me was that she needed to ask her parents. I was dumbfounded. Didnt know what to do. We kinda broke off after that.\n\n I stopped seeking relationships at that point. This was about 10 years ago. I think I need help.",

                              "text": "What is weird to me about this whole thing is the framing, and I think that it might actually demonstrate the problem with how many men think about consent.\n\nLike, I wanted women to be enthusiastic about anything remotely sexual that we did. I am pretty good at picking up hints and flirting, but I chose to not read into flirtation. Rather, if I thought a girl was flirting with me, I would just ask her if she was. I would do it in a non-clinical way, but *asking* solves the problem.\n\nSo like the condom example here: If I was somehow unaware that a woman taking off her pants and holding a condom out to me was an explicit invitation for sex, I could literally just say something along the lines of \"Would you like me to try it on for you?\" or whatever. Or if you can't think of anything just say \"Do you want to have sex?\" Bad flirting or dumb questions are not going to ruin the mood, horny people are horny and bad dialogue is not an obstacle.\n\nThat is what is so weird about this though. It doesn't even require social skills, it just requires thinking about her agency as a real thing she is aware of.\n\nThe reason I did not read into vague hints was never because I was terrified of being falsely accused of anything. That is, for one, not a common problem. I could also die in a car wreck, but that does not stop me from getting in cars despite the relatively higher danger level. Nor does ignoring hints with women *protect* you from false accusations. People can accuse anyone of anything at any time.\n\nThe reason I did not read into hints was *because I did not want to hurt anyone.* And so because it was not all about how I felt, and I was interested in their comfort and safety as well, the answer to \"ask them\" is obvious.\n\nSo if any guys are out there worried about how they can know if a woman is consenting: just ask. It really is that simple. \n\nWomen should also do the same thing too. Most women have a much keener understanding of consent than men by nessecity, but that does not make them immune to the same effect, and so they should just ask too.",

Sex doesn\u2019t actually require social skills, altho they do help. \n\nAnyways, you could theoretically say \u201cI want you to place your penis inside me, remove it, then repeat until one or both of us has an orgasm and then I would like to fall asleep together\u201d and then still randomly decide to tell people you were raped. Is this common? No. But it\u2019s still theoretically possible so being verbally clear really makes no difference anyway. Plus, you could even put it in writing that you want to have sex then change your mind midway through, and if the other person continues that still is rape. Enthusiastic consent can be withdrawn at any time. So what a person says initially is not the only thing that matters. \n\nWhat irks me about how people are framing this is that they are essentially implying that it is 1. Bad to believe women who say they were sexually abused because they were probably lying about it \n2. That it\u2019s really so hard NOT to abuse someone sexually, because people aren\u2019t clear enough about their boundaries. \n\nIt is so easy not to sexually assault someone if you are paying attention to them even a little bit, so these comments are honestly scary to me.",

If you\u2019re not sure if she wants to progress further, her behavior certainly will tell you and if not, both are capable of speaking about it. I\u2019m so confused about why this is an issue at all. Of course, being bad at reading body language or understanding other people isn\u2019t a crime and really if that\u2019s the case speaking directly is no issue, although it\u2019s more awkward/stilted probably. It\u2019s the framing that is so fuckin weird to me. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be accused of assault.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s the concern, then why not be afraid that you don\u2019t want to, by being overly eager, cross a boundary and make someone anxious or hurt them? What is this fear about a false accusation when that could happen with a person who has never even come close to sleeping with you? Why be afraid of something that almost never happens compared to violating someone\u2019s boundaries inadvertently which happens constantly? Y\u2019all are wild",

A while before that, before we were friends, I was her boss and the first person she called after she was roofied and raped.  When she was talking with me she was still experiencing some of the effects of the drug, and wasn't sure if she drank too much or what happened, but that there was a guy...  I encouraged her to go to the hospital and get a blood test as it wasn't the first time I had had a conversation like that in my life. \n\nI naturally lean heavily on the informed consent side.  I know both of us had a history of casual sex while intoxicated (just not with each other) and maybe she needed some liquid, herbal or powdery courage, but all the same, she was special to me.  She was a very close friend.  I covered up a crime for her.  She violently threatened a woman who was trying to spread some bad rumors about me after I left for another opportunity.  She was a badass boss bitch who brightened up every room she walked into.  She was so sweet and funny on your worst day it was hard not to smile and laugh when she was around.   Kind to strangers and ruthless to those who wronged her and fiercely protective of those she cared for.  She was the sort of woman who if one of her team members was struggling, she'd snort some addy and coke and pull an all nighter to cover for them and never tell anyone.\n\nThe sort of girl who if she was your mistress, you would want to buy a _nice_ house for, and she'd probably make you do it too.  But then not live in it because she was a prideful MFer and would pay for her own house, thank you very much.\n\nSigh.  I wish I could have at least talked to her after that night.  We were friends and even after we were working at other companies, still regularly met up to shoot pool and the shit.  Had I known going to that _one_ concert with her instead of any of the other shows we went to together would mean we weren't friends anymore, I would have never gone.  Shit. If I knew she had feelings for me too, I would have tried to figure a way to make that work.  She was the sort of woman you'd want to have grandkids with.  Fuck.  Sometimes I still get a little bit of heartache when I think about her, and I've gone through divorce and custody battles.",

She was the sort of woman who would spitefully step over and on you if you underestimated her just because she was a small hot blonde).  Maybe she was worried I viewed her as a victim because I knew something that happened to her during a dark time, and thought I was being too \"gentle\" with her and so disrespected her agency?\n\nI don't get to know.\n\nI've burned plenty of bridges myself over smaller slights than this one, so yeah. I guess you are right.  And I feel silly that I never looked at this way before because usually I consider myself to be a pretty clever person, though I admit I have a blind spot when I care about someone.  Thank you. Long-term we probably would have burned the bridge over something else.  Still, would have been nice if we got to burn some bridges _together_ before we burned the one between us.",

We go to the liquor  store and buy some booze and go back to my apartment  to watch a movie.  What movie  do we decide to watch? Yep that's right, my sheltered ass thought  Deliverance would  be funny to watch since neither  has  seen it and I love a good cringe Horror? Movie. So this poor guy puts up with it and we drink enough  to where I offer him to spend the night.   \n\nBeing the sheltered virgin I am I figure we don't  know  each other  well so its probably  best if we sleep  separate.  So I pull out the pull out couch bed for him.  We hang out for a bit more making drunk talk about  dinosaurs, and he says \"I wanna bite your face\" I realize  now that was probably  a hint to at least kiss, but I just laugh tell him Goodnight  and go upstairs to bed.",

Pretty soon we were studying together, playing badminton between classes and having lunch together at school. Almost an entire semester went by like this and Jane's friend asked me to have lunch with her. I thought that was weird, but went anyways. Jane's friend sat my dumb ass down and asked what my problem was. I didn't understand. Jane's friend got heated and said \"you've been hanging out with Jane every day for three months and haven't even asked for her number let alone tried to ask her out! Can't you see she has a crush on you?!\" I was dumbfounded. Just clueless that this cute girl who wanted to hang out with me every day liked me. Maybe it was that my self esteem was rocked due to my last relationship ending after I was cheated on multiple times. \n\nIt didn't work out with Jane, I was usually busy 12-16 hours a day between school and work. We went on one awkward date on a Friday night when I was so exhausted from the week I was trying not to fall asleep at the bar. I'm sure I was boring as hell on that date, but Jane did make me a little better at picking up on hints.",

The people there where mostly two types, circus families consisting of married people and their kids and their circus acts, and carnies who tend to be drifters with various criminal records and drinking issues.   \n\nOne 21 year old woman was there from Russia because her mother was from a circus family and was shaking up with the owner.  So there was her extremely fine Russian self and my young boyish good looking college-bound self, who also happened to be a virgin who had only made out with two or three girls ever.   She flirted for the whole damn summer and at one point while talking with someone else put her arms around me from behind and pressed her claws into me like some sort of hot Russian Domme and said \"Heee izzz mine\" to someone else.   Long story short, I was convinced she did not want to do anything with me, because why would that hottie have any interest in little old me?  \n\nSo that's the story of how I didn't spend the summer before college banging a Russian hottie while we traveled all around the country slinging popcorn and entertaining kids.",

Right when I started getting over her during summer break she had gotten into the habit of texting me, and we were getting close. One night she asks me what my favorite sex position was and I text back \"uhh probably cowgirl\". Since I would be just as open with my male friends I figured she was just making conversation. I didnt find out till much later that she was trying to sext me. My other friend had to legitimately spell it out for me that this chick liked me, which I thought impossible since she had rejected me before.\n\nOnce we started going out we were also left alone at her place while watching a movie like in your story. I Tried to do that thing where you casually put your arm around her and accidentally grazed her boob with my hand. My dumbass apologizes and she goes \"that wasn't my boob, this is my boob\" and takes my hand and plants it firmly on her chest. I finally got the message then and the rest was smooth sailing.

I said \u201cno, no one I can really think of. Well, I gotta get home, see ya!\u201d and left.\n\nI realized a couple years later what was going on, and man was I pissed at myself. I had such a huge crush on this girl, I think maybe I might\u2019ve liked her so much that I assumed she was way out of my league and would never be interested in me, so I just never put two and two together. I wound up running into her again a couple years back at my sister\u2019s wedding (her dad was apparently one of my dad\u2019s golfing buddies), and we chatted a bit. She\u2019s married and has kids now. Still really hot, too. I\u2019m a dumbass.",

I got home later that day and signed into my Myspace and there was a message from her. \n\n\u201cI enjoyed seeing you at McDonald\u2019s today. You\u2019re sexy as ever. We should fuck.\u201d\n\nMy reply. I shit you not. \n\n\u201cLol\u201d\n\nI just couldn\u2019t fathom why she\u2019d be interested so it had to be a joke right?\n\nI have countless stories just like that. If I could smack young me I would, but maybe my obliviousness and lack of confidence saved me from an std or something. Some wild girls came after me. \n\nOk fuck, even better story. \n\nI worked with this super sexy redhead. I was single. She and I became really good friends and I just thought she was leagues above me, never even crossed my mind as a possibility. So she told me her computer was running slow and asked me if I could try to speed it up. I said, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll throw some ram in there and upgrade your processor. We\u2019ll get it going faster.\u201d She replies, \u201cOk, thank you.  Also there is a folder in my pictures titled \u201cglitter art\u201d and it\u2019s full of nude photos of me, I\u2019d like you to look at them.\u201d \n\nI took the computer home, looked at the pics, and my god my best friend was all, \u201cShe told you to look at nude pics. Bro. She wants you!!\u201d I said, \u201cOh no bruh it\u2019s not like that, she just trusts me. She\u2019s artsy, she don\u2019t think of me like that.\u201d \n\nGoddamn you young theangryseal!!! Goddamn you!!!\n\nUltimately though I got ahold of myself. My girlfriend is smoking hot and the sweetest thing on this planet.

She says something to the effect of \"this bra is so uncomfortable\", takes it off. Leaving her quite frankly huge chest only covered by a skin tight white tank top. Gulp. I could feel my cheeks turn red as well as blood rushing other places but I was clueless this was my cue lol. She didn't dump me but realized quickly she would probably have to be a bit more direct w me. She asked me the next day why I didn't do anything. I was like umm. I didn't know. I was super shy so that didn't help. Had a couple girls ask why I never tried or flat out told me I dropped the ball when I tt them later in life (mostly on social media) couple of them literally stayed the night at my house and slept in bed next to me. I was sooo clueless lol",

Met a girl who was at the time literally perfect to me. Fast forward to the first time she invited me to her dorm, we were just chilling when all of a sudden she said she had to take a shower. Cool, she\u2019s a very clean girl. She comes back out we just start talking normally again then she brings up how she wants a massage and for me to lotion her back, I obliged and start giving her a back massage. By this time she\u2019s fully nude on her stomach as I rub her down, she\u2019s clearly (now that I look back at it) into it and yet I\u2019m still behind her fully clothed. She tells me to get comfortable and I take my shirt off but for some dumb reason keep my jeans on. Back to massaging, move down her back to her legs, butt, thighs, oh my god my hand is touching the inner thigh and she\u2019s squirming. When she squirms my thumb grazes her sweet spot and she lets out a faint moan. I\u2019m still oblivious to all these hints few more minutes of that go by and she lays there like she\u2019s sleep. My first thought was that the massage must\u2019ve been so good she fell asleep so you know what I do climb up beside her and close my eyes to go to sleep too. She wakes me up like 30 minutes later and says she has something to do, basically an excuse to get me to leave cause I failed so bad lmao.\n\nWe stopped talking not too long after that night but she eventually told me we would have did it that night if I had made a move. In my defense it wasn\u2019t that I never thought about it, in the moment I thought it\u2019s be kinda rapey if mid massage I just pulled my member out and started going to town, I was waiting for her to say we could have sex instead of taking the hint that she wanted to. First time I ever had blue balls in my life but I definitely learned a lesson in speaking up since then. Now I just ask if I\u2019m interested.",

I had to directly talk to him and say \u201chey, you know what everyone is saying about me being into you? It\u2019s true, I want you\u201d and he still doubted for a couple of hours (mind you that this conversation happened in person and we kept together while he was handling the information in his head) before finally having our first kiss. At least after realizing what was going on he wasn\u2019t slow again about other things such as sex.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 years together by now and he still doesn\u2019t believe me when I see someone into him and warn him about it, he thinks it\u2019s not possible for another woman to want him because he believes it was already hard enough having me to like him.",

In my head i was thinking, she totally digs me I'm in here. Approaching the end of the day she asked me to come over to her house to hang and watch something. I was like \"Yeah Awesome!\" and we go to her hour and watch The Proposal. She tells me she is warm and is gonna get changed. She takes off her jeans in front of me and is smoking hot. I can still picture that ass. I figured she was just comfortable with her body. She came back over and sat next to me and we watched some other stuff. \n\nNext week back at work i heard her and one of our co-workers talking another girl in one of the chill out rooms my office had. Girls are seriously worse than men for sex talk where i live. The other girl asked her if we did anything clearly sounding like there was a talk before about seducing me. She said \"Nah nothing he was clueless and wouldn't make a move, We just hung out. He got me some lunch and dinner and we watched a movie, He is just a really nice guy.\" \n\nAt that point i knew that i went from being somebody she wanted to fool around with to an guy whos inaction put her off. I was trying to be a gentleman but struck out because i wouldn't make any of the moves. I heard her twice playing Fuck Marry Kill with the girls in the office about people they knew. I became the office Marry both times which is I think just code for not the sexy one lol.  It was later by some time we were hanging out and I asked her about that day. she confessed she was making all the moves asking me out. asking me home making excuses to get undressed next to me. I told her i figured she just wanted to be comfortable at home and she laughed. I just said ah fuck i am an idiot. I told her I thought she was gorgeous and she said she could tell. I Friendzoned myself lol.",

They were super interesting\u2026 and probably the most good looking, athletic girls I had ever seen and talked to ha. Volleyball players. \n\nI was talking to one behind the car after the concert (~10pm?) and said something about how athletic she was and how her height probably helped a lot in volleyball (or something equally awkward)\u2026 she agreed and said check out these legs, and took my hands and put them on her legs to feel how strong they were\u2026 she mentioned her abs too and did the same\u2026 took my hands to her torso and slowly moved them up her body. I wasn\u2019t sure at the time if she meant to bring them all the way to her boobs, or if they were just so well endowed that it was an accident. \n\nI mentioned that I wrestled and she said she wanted me to teach her some wrestling moves\u2026 I took it literally and picked her up. We had a good laugh and rejoined her friend. \n\nLater she came over and said quietly to me that her ride called and was \u201cgoing to be late\u201d and asked if I could take everyone back to her place\u2026 and that her parents were out of town for the weekend and she had plenty of liquor at home\u2026 \n\n\nMy dumb ass told her I couldn\u2019t give her a ride home because (something) and they ended up going back to their car after a few. I told my friend that \u201cshe lied about needing a ride\u201d and my friend just looked at me and said \u201cyou are such a dumbass.\u201d",
