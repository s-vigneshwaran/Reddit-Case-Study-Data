Translating the Bible and later being able to distribute it en masse played a big part in the reformation of Christianity, in the sense that it split the church between traditional catholics and the newly emerged protestants.",

She is so off the rails crazy now I barely recognize her. She is unbearable as she sees she will be in eternity sitting at gods feet with my husband and me tortured in hell and she cannot bear it. I was to cry as I write this as she is the only family I have left\u2026I bring up actual passages written-I can have the book I hand & she will twist the words or deny they exists (my educated Granddparents were very liberal Methodist in the south. After being kicked out of Sunday School, after an afternoon w my Grt Grandfather learning where Eden had likely been in \nMesopotamia we looked on the globe to find where that would be. I had seen photos of people there in the National Geographic\u2019s he made sure I had at birth and were preferred to kids picture books. I colored Jesus brown w dark eyes and hair. The teachers freaked. There were some other instances of me knowing things I shouldn\u2019t know-my parents decided moons made of cheese and the stork bringing babies off limits and told me the truth. When I informed a classroom that the stork didn\u2019t exist and what happens in pregnancy there was mayhem and I was in serious hot water. So after being banned from church going, I decided maybe God was not the be all & end all. They respected this but insisted I read the Bible and discuss it as all educated people should know it to know source material for other works. So that said, the guy who did their Bible study was a lunatic and she believes all his ridiculous crap as being in the Bible. I know have no sane, thinking family member left. It breaks my heart, & I miss her thoughtful, kind advice and safety I felt when she is the only witness I have to when I was a child.",

They used actual places and occurrences to give their tales more credibility, but the stories told in the Bible are bullshit. \n\n>Don't come looking for fairy tales in the bible; it wasn't meant to be one, and it isn't.\n\n*ALL* the Bible *is* is fairytales!!

He realized it was hard to see the goodness in the world since Satan reigns over the earth, so he sent his Son to show there is a better way to live. Be kind to your neighbors, do good things, basically reinforcing the commandments, and living his best by them. Not even He, the Son of God was perfect. \n\nI was a Christian as a child. Read my Bible, memorized Bible verses, and even sang in the choir. Then life got tough, won't go into details, but I turned my back on God, cursing him and laughing at people who blindly believed in him, and throwing away my baptism certificate thing I got. After all, how could a loving, all powerful God let all these bad things happen not only to me, but the other people suffering? I felt betrayed and lied to. Fell away for almost 15 years. \n\nThen one day, I was so depressed, suicidal, and brainstorming a three tiered plan guaranteed to work if the first two steps failed when I broke down and started praying. I prayed and cried until I fell asleep. When I woke up, I felt so different. It could have been a hormonal thing or something weird with my nervous system, but everything felt real again. Like, the sun felt warm and the breeze felt cool. Before it was just there. I still live with depression, but I am able to manage it without medication. Same with my anxiety, bpd, and my schizophrenic episodes stopped! I was able to quit smoking cigarettes eventually, I started getting healthy, and bought a new Bible. My boyfriend and I read it and talk about it often. \n\nThe way I see it, it could have just been me that made all of those changes by myself, but I had tried on many occasions before. It was only when I accepted God into my life again that these efforts started working. It wasn't at all instant, except maybe my smoking cessation. That's a story in and of it's self.\n\nIf praying to a Sky Daddy asking for help opens me up to  become a healthier, more understanding, patient, generous, kind, and helpful person to the best of my abilities is wrong, let me be wrong! I don't talk bad about other people, I don't hate anyone, I try to check myself when I am making any judgements towards someone else and even myself, and I try to keep a positive mindset.",

My MIL was a devout Catholic and didn't even own a Bible. \n\nRemember, centuries ago, the only way to get an education was to go to seminary to become a priest. No one owned books (even bibles) because they didn't know how to read, most people were extremely poor, and books were expensive. \n\nThat said, my personal experience as a woman is that most Christian denominations don't want people reading the Bible outside their sanctioned, structured Bible studies. They have to be able to intervene when people notice the blatant, glaring contradictions throughout the Bible.",

I'm a big believer that  Christians should read the Bible for themselves to form their own opinions; I feel like the devout members of other religions actually study their religion, while Christians just love to claim being devout without putting any work in. It's quite sad, really, sitting and letting another man tell you what to believe and how to live while simultaneously claiming that only God can lead and guide you. The preacher of the church I grew up in I truly believe had a connection to a higher spirit, the man knows things nobody speaks. But I STILL question some of his beliefs, because in the end he is a MAN. A huge point of the Bible is man is flawed, yet so many Christians act like it says SOME men are flawed, but Christians aren't flawed, as long as they believe like me.",

They are very objective and when they make mistakes on an article they will put their edits in the story but still tell you at the bottom where they messed up initially. Anyone that has actually listened or read their stories would know that they put out a great journalistic product and are probably the best source for it in the US.",

They also treat everyone with respect and aren\u2019t yelling at guests or people they may have a different view on the topic. There also very good at contractions, which is very crucial in making sure they try to get you the most accurate information possible.\n\nI\u2019m not saying switch to NPR, I\u2019m just saying maybe you should look at what the professionals in their own field consider to be the gold standard.

Luke 3 lists it through Joseph, clear back to Adam, which is interesting since he would have no influence on it, but probably has to do with the Jewish tradition. However, Matthew 1, the very first chapter in the New Testament, starts with listing Jesus' ancestry through Mary, back to Abraham, which can be figured out back to Adam. IMO this one makes more sense, since that's the one that would really matter, since she's the one that would have any connection to the ancestry of Jesus.",

Abraham is viewed as the father of Judaism now. Abraham\u2019s son is Isaac. Isaac\u2019s son is Jacob. Jacob would be called Israel and his twelve sons would establish the 12 tribes of the nation of Israel, one of those sons named Judah, founder of the tribe of Judea, and the namesake for those we now think of as the Jewish ethnoreligious group. \n\nI\u2019m not sure when the condition of being a Jew was passed on the female line, but perhaps it was specifically due to Jews or their ancestors migrating (or being forced out) from their land. When you are surrounded by non-Jews it\u2019s harder to know who the father of a child may be, but the mother is clear. Important to note that was an issue from the beginning, according to the story of Joseph (Judah\u2019s brother) who helped his family migrate to Egypt. \n\nMoses would come 3 generations later, when he led the Israelites out of Egypt, and then codified the 10 commandments. So if you\u2019re following along, Lot would have been 5-6 generations earlier.",

They therefore resorted to incest in order to preserve the human race.[7] This was also the general opinion of the Early Church Fathers, such as Augustine,[8] Chrysostom[9] and Irenaeus.[10] The basis of this idea is the comment of the elder daughter that \"there is not a man in the earth\" to give them children.[11] However, commentators such as John Calvin have pointed out that the family had only recently dwelt in Zoar, so they must have known they were not the only people left alive. Calvin therefore concludes that the elder daughter's remark refers not to the whole earth, but only to the region in which they were living.[12]\n\nWell it is an arguable point.  The story is ultimately a poorly conceived story about two cartoonishly absurd cities, an absurdist event, an absurd deity, two absurdist daughters who we have to assume absurd things about to make sense of incestuous rape which shouldn\u2019t be a virtuous thing ever.\n\nThe only reason this story is ok for children is because of \u201cfaith.\u201d  And if it is ok then they are clearly ready for the evils of American history.",

I\u2019ve studied a lot of doctrine and as a historical text   the bible says a lot of shit but rarely is showing it as a good thing that is recommended)",

The older one said to the younger, \"Our father is old and there is no man in the land to marry us in the usual manner. Come, let us ply our father with wine and lay with him that we may give life to offspring through our father.\"\n>\n> So they plied their father with wine on that night; and the older one came and lay with her father, he was not aware of her lying down and of her getting up.\n>\n>And it was on the next day that the older one said to the younger, \"Behold, I lay with my father last night; let us ply him with wine tonight as well, and you come lay with him that we may give life to offspring through our father.\"\n>\n> So they plied their father with wine that night also; and the younger one got up and lay with him, and he was not aware of her lying down and of her getting up.\n>\n> Thus, Lot's two daughters conceived from their father.",

Keep in mind the ArtScroll is an orthodox commentary so this is about as reactionary as Judaism gets too.\n\n>The implication of verse 19 is that the seed of Sodom's wickedness lay in its failure to abide by the principles that Abraham would inculcate in his offspring. The cruelties of Sodom have become part of the language as the epitome of selfishness, callousness and depravity, but the root of their evil was greed. Sodom was a rich and fertile region and, as such, it was a magnet for people seeking to make their fortune, as it was for Lot. But the Sodomites wanted to maintain their own prosperity and not be encumbered by a flood of poor immigrants. The wealthy and well-connected Lots of the world were welcome in Sodom, because they would give more to the economy than they would take. To discourage undesirable newcomers, however, the Sodomites institutionalized state cruelty, so that it became a crime to feed a starving person or offer alms to a beggar. Even the sexual perversion [sic] for which Sodom is notorious was employed to keep visitors away. According to one opinion of the Sages, this cruelty stemmed from an attitude of, \"What's mine is mine and what is yours is yours (Avos 5:10),\" or, in the popular idiom, \"Neither a lender nor a borrower be.\" Such selfishness descends to cruelty and perversion--and a metropolis that elevates such behavior to a legitimate way of life forfeits its right to exist.\n\nYeah, it's uh, weirdly based for the Orthodox",

It's not an unreasonable conclusion to say there were other humans but they weren't included in geneological records because they weren't part of the line going from Adam to Jesus.

The Bible, and the way that Christianity has been practiced also, has a history and current practice of treating women quite badly. To be blunt, it treats everyone badly: terrorizing people, starting as children, with threats of eternal hellfire for being human, or even for the transgressions of some mythical ancestor who did not exist. But it treats women extra badly.\n\nYou don't have to feel this fear, shame, and confusion. Millions of us don't believe in any supernatural gods or demons. Humans created tens of thousands of gods, to explain nature and to seek comfort. The Christian god is just one more myth, no more likely to be true than the other ones.",

If it is the word of God, why is some of it to be taken literally but other parts to be \"interpreted.\" \n\nThe entire process is incredibly subjective which is one of the main reasons there are tens of thousands of different denominations/sects of Christianity. I don't give a shit if people read or believe in the Bible, but it pisses me off when people try to either excuse the abominable acts it portrays (rape, incest, murder, etc.) or try to pass it off as fact when there is no evidence to support their claim.",

He must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah[a](D) of barley flour(E) on her behalf. He must not pour olive oil on it or put incense on it, because it is a grain offering for jealousy,(F) a reminder-offering(G) to draw attention to wrongdoing.\n\n16 \u201c\u2018The priest shall bring her and have her stand before the Lord. 17 Then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water. 18 After the priest has had the woman stand before the Lord, he shall loosen her hair(H) and place in her hands the reminder-offering, the grain offering for jealousy,(I) while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse.(J) 19 Then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her, \u201cIf no other man has had sexual relations with you and you have not gone astray(K) and become impure while married to your husband, may this bitter water that brings a curse(L) not harm you. 20 But if you have gone astray(M) while married to your husband and you have made yourself impure by having sexual relations with a man other than your husband\u201d\u2014 21 here the priest is to put the woman under this curse(N)\u2014\u201cmay the Lord cause you to become a curse[b] among your people when he makes your womb miscarry and your abdomen swell. 22 May this water(O) that brings a curse(P) enter your body so that your abdomen swells or your womb miscarries.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Then the woman is to say, \u201cAmen. So be it.(Q)\u201d\n\n23 \u201c\u2018The priest is to write these curses on a scroll(R) and then wash them off into the bitter water. 24 He shall make the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse, and this water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering will enter her. 25 The priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy, wave it before the Lord(S) and bring it to the altar. 26 The priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial[c] offering(T) and burn it on the altar; after that, he is to have the woman drink the water. 27 If she has made herself impure and been unfaithful to her husband, this will be the result: When she is made to drink the water that brings a curse and causes bitter suffering, it will enter her, her abdomen will swell and her womb will miscarry, and she will become a curse.(U) 28 If, however, the woman has not made herself impure, but is clean, she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children.\n\n29 \u201c\u2018This, then, is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray(V) and makes herself impure while married to her husband, 30 or when feelings of jealousy(W) come over a man because he suspects his wife. The priest is to have her stand before the Lord and is to apply this entire law to her. 31 The husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing, but the woman will bear the consequences(X) of her sin.",

It was all getting overly complicated so Jesus kept it simple and preached Love above all else. Everything after love could be worked out if love was always present. Have at least a basic level of respect for everybody around you. He basically broke it down to one simple idea. THAT I could follow. Nobody else said it like he did. That is Christianity to me.

That much is true (and also a literary usage to be fair, but we'll ignore that). Where it's being misconstrued here is believing that somehow the loins of a person refers to the miscarriage or abortion of an illegitimate offspring. \n\nThe word for thigh in hebrew is used 34 times. 2 of those are loins (the verses mentioned by Poole). Yet 21 are thigh. It's clear what the primary purpose of the word is intended for when in doubt. However, if we ignore it being thigh, just for sake of the argument, at worst it means loins (which isn't an impossibility either). Still nothing regarding miscarrying or aborting. That would be dishonest.\n\nIf you're curious, the other uses are side (7x), shaft [referring to a candlestick] (3x), and body (1x).",

Bloating seems like a decent visual indicator.\n\nAside from that, I think it's important that the bible mentions this process multiple times in meticulous detail (to the point of almost being annoying) for a reason. Because it wants you to focus on the primary and foremost purpose of this being a test for adultery.\n\nIt doesn't mention anything regarding pregnancy during the ritual because it's irrelevant and not the focus. To shift the focus into an issue regarding miscarriages would be to ignore the 2-3 times it describes the process without mentioning it at all.\n\nFertility could definitely play a part in it, but it would just be the *ability* to conceive. We can't automatically extend miscarriage or abortion into that same thought bubble just because it's reproduction-related. That would be like saying cars and bikes are synonymous because they have tires.\n\nThey're different events and would be spoken of differently if mentioned.",

However, there are other cases where it clearly does. Words often have more than one definition. So it's not a huge stretch to assume it refers to the womb in this case.\n\nThe choice of word to explain what is supposed to happen to the 'thigh' also indicates that we're not talking about an actual thigh - the word chosen is \u05e0\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d4 (naphal), which is mostly used to mean 'fall', but could mean 'rot' or 'waste away'. For the thigh to fall off, rot or waste away seems an incongruent conclusion compared to having the womb or sexual organs do the same, especially in a context that so directly deals with a sexual matter.\n\nNote that the previous paragraph does not mean it's a description of an abortion - it could just as well be her groin is fouled by an indelible stench or loss of future fertility.\n\nSome will argue that the rest of Number 5:11-31 does not indicate the woman is pregnant, and thus the ritual cannot refer to an abortion, as there may be nothing to abort. This is disingenuous - the text does describe sexual relations, and with the dearth of condoms at the time, pregnancy is an expected (though not guaranteed, of course) consequence.",

We can't substitute meanings just because. The many cases you're referring to are only 2 verses: Gen 46:26 & Ex 1:5.\n\nTo be fair though, there are indeed 2 verses where Thigh is used for Loins of a generation. I will agree it sounds odd to suggest a random leg be something that effectively departs from a spouse over an adultery issue. It does however make sense why translators default to thigh as thigh is the more common translation among other passages by a factor of 10.\n\nAt the absolute worst this could refer to the loins in a way that suggests she would be unable to bear children which would've been a great loss in those days as women were unfortunately defined by such matters as bearing many sons. Still not regarding miscarriage, but rather the ability to conceive in the first place. A strong point for this translation would be the follow-up of Num 5:28 where it mentions if she is innocent then she will \"be free, and shall conceive seed\".\n\nThe bible also repeats the factors of this process many times without once mentioning any aftermath of what would happen supposing she was pregnant. I believe this is intentional to show the process is not about the affects of a sexual relationship leading to conception, but merely the adultery itself.",

It makes sense to default to 'thigh' from a frequency standpoint yes, but I don't see how it makes sense semantically.\n\nIt seems to me the ordeal of bitter water would make sense as a pregnancy test used to test for infidelity - if she's pregnant and it's not with the husband, then clearly (with the exception of virgin Mary :p) she's been boinking someone else. This pregnancy test would also have the side effect of killing the child, which is usually not desired, but would be in this case. Meanwhile, I don't see how this thigh business makes sense.",

When your whole world is steeped in dogma from day one, and you're taught that faith will keep you from burning for eternity, you tend not to question.    \nHonestly I think that most world religions are attempting to explain the same ineffable realities using the parlance of the times in which they were formed.

Even today, it is [still on their website:](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/resolution-on-abortion-2/)\n\n> *we call upon Southern Baptists to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.*\n\n\nAnd when Roe was decided, the Baptist Press (the national newswire of the southern baptists) [said:](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/trevin-wax/baptist-press-initial-reporting-on-roe-v-wade/)\n\n> *Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the Supreme Court abortion decision.*\n\nEven as late as [1978](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/resolution-on-abortion-5/) they still thought government should keep its nose out of a lady's business, reiterating [their resolution from 1977:](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/resolution-on-abortion-4/)\n\n> we also affirm our conviction about the limited role of government in dealing with matters relating to abortion, and support the right of expectant mothers to the full range of medical services and personal counseling for the preservation of life and health.\n\nThe lead attorney on *Roe* was a [devout Southern Baptist](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/roe-v-wades-secret-heroine-tells-her-story) and her [2nd chair](https://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/weddington-sarah-r-1945)  was a  methodist preacher's daughter too.\n\nOne of the main verses the evangelicals used to cite was in Genesis where God only puts a soul into the body of Adam once its fully formed and able to breathe.  The idea is that if a child isn't capable of breathing on its own, it doesn't have a soul yet:\n\n*And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.*  \n(Genesis 2:7)",

I don't disagree that the Christian god is a pretty petty dude who kills at will on the Bible. I don't even think most Christians disagree with that. My issue is that the complete end utter basis for evangelical voters wanting bans on abortion is because they think it is murder BECAUSE GOD THINKS ITS MURDER when if you just look at the Bible, God clearly doesn't place the same value on an unborn child as a birthed one. \n\nIt's just further proof that modern Christians done read the Bible's they claim is the end all be all of human knowledge.",

And it is not administered by a human, but God who punishes the unfaithful with a miscarriage. It is not presented as an abortion clinic, but a place where God will punish the individual if they were unfaithful. Therefore this doesn't have anything to do with the morality of humans having abortions, and if anything it presents it as a bad thing (it is described as a curse). \n\nSo what I gather from this is that abortions should be offered at church and let god make the call on whether the baby should be born...and since his only prerequisite is that it be a child born of adulterous behavior, that's, like, all of the babies currently being presented for abortion. \n\n>Then we turn to other passages (like God forming life in the womb (Psalm 139:13) \n\nGod may make reference to life existing within the womb. I don't know of any pro-choice people who think a zygote or whatever stage of life the unborn child is in is not alive. The pro choice argument is typically \"yes it's alive but is it cognizant and if not, then nothing of value was lost\". I know the Bible says \"thou shalt not kill\" but it certainly doesn't care when we kill fish. So there's a delineating line that has to be crossed before killing is amoral and that line doesn't just start at \"human\" because god commands the killing of humans in the Bible. When it comes to unborn babies the line is apparently whether or not the child was conceived in wedlock from non adulterous parents, which again, almost no person seeking an abortion in 2021 would qualify as. \n\n>and God making humans in his image (Genesis 1:26)) to determine that a human intentionally taking the life of the unborn (another human) is immoral.\n\nBeing made in gods image is a funny thing to me. How are we made in his image? Do we look like him? Does he have a penis or a vagina? Or both? What does he use them for? Does he have a nose which is used to supply the lungs w oxygen? Does he have lungs? If he does have lungs, could you theoretically kill god by holding his nose and suffocating him? Certainly you see the absurdity in assuming the omnipotent god of the universe looks like a hairless ape that didn't even show up on the planet for millennia after the rest of the creatures. You can make the argument that we are made in his image in that you believe we have a soul which is modeled after god the entity, but that's as far as I can personally entertain that concept. \n\nThat being said, there is a reason God's Old Testament law was so harsh. God is perfect and his standard is perfection. The Israelites broke his law again and again, and for all the divine punishment he administered, the most prominent theme of the Old Testament is God's mercy on his people. This would culminate with his ultimate act of mercy, sending Jesus to take the punishment all humans deserve for breaking the law.\n\n> I would argue that the prominent theme of the Old Testament is much more in line with god telling his people that if they fuck around they'll end up like the people who died in the flood or Sodom and gamorrah...or like the people of Moses camp before he talked god out of it...which begs the question if god is perfect how did a human change his mind? It doesn't seem like a loving god who created you as the most imperfect creature on the planet but who still holds you to a standard of perfection he freely admits you can't adhere to...or he will genocide you. \n\nJust my two cents.",

Mankind was created in the image of God and the angels, but Adam has no such designation. \n\nGenesis 1 talks about creating all the plants and animals then mankind, with God telling mankind being told to be fruitful and multiply, and to fill the Earth and conquer it. \n\nGenesis 2 talks specifically about Adam and Eve being placed within the confines of the Garden, separate from the rest of the world. Like they were a separate experiment. \n\nGenesis 1:20-31: \n\n>20 And God said, \u201cLet the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.\u201d 21 So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22 God blessed them and said, \u201cBe fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.\u201d 23 And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the fifth day.\r  \n\r  \n24 And God said, \u201cLet the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.\u201d And it was so. 25 God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.  \n>  \n>26 Then God said, \u201cLet us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals and over all the creatures that move along the ground.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n27 So God created mankind in his own image,\r  \nin the image of God he created them;\r  \nmale and female he created them.  \n>  \n>28 God blessed them and said to them, \u201cBe fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n29 Then God said, \u201cI give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30 And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground\u2014everything that has the breath of life in it\u2014I give every green plant for food.\u201d And it was so.\r  \n\r  \n31 God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the sixth day.\n\nGenesis 2 says that Adam was created before anything else, and put him in the garden. Genesis 2:1-25\n\n>1 Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.\r  \n\r  \n2 By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.\r  \n\r\r  \n4 This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, when the Lord God made the earth and the heavens.\r  \n\r  \n5 Now no shrub had yet appeared on the earth and no plant had yet sprung up, for the Lord God had not sent rain on the earth and there was no one to work the ground, 6 but streams\\[b\\] came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground. 7 Then the Lord God formed a man\\[c\\] from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.\r  \n\r  \n8 Now the Lord God had planted a garden in the east, in Eden; and there he put the man he had formed. 9 The Lord God made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground\u2014trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food. In the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.\r  \n\r  \n10 A river watering the garden flowed from Eden; from there it was separated into four headwaters. 11 The name of the first is the Pishon; it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12 (The gold of that land is good; aromatic resin\\[d\\] and onyx are also there.) 13 The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. 14 The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Ashur. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\r  \n\r  \n15 The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it. 16 And the Lord God commanded the man, \u201cYou are free to eat from any tree in the garden; 17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n18 The Lord God said, \u201cIt is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper suitable for him.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n19 Now the Lord God had formed out of the ground all the wild animals and all the birds in the sky. He brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. 20 So the man gave names to all the livestock, the birds in the sky and all the wild animals.\r  \n\r  \nBut for Adam\\[f\\] no suitable helper was found. 21 So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man\u2019s ribs\\[g\\] and then closed up the place with flesh. 22 Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib\\[h\\] he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.\r  \n\r  \n23 The man said,\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis is now bone of my bones\r  \nand flesh of my flesh;\r  \nshe shall be called \u2018woman,\u2019\r  \nfor she was taken out of man.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n24 That is why a man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife, and they become one flesh.\r  \n\r  \n25 Adam and his wife were both naked, and they felt no shame.",

The Hebrew word you cite is not always translated as sex. It shows up a lot. Why in that story, where it seems so out of place, a mob showing up at the door, do modern bibles explicitly have, \"bring them out so that we might have sex with them.\"  Because that's what the Bibles published in America after 1975 say.\n\nTake a class with a Jewish biblical scholar and they make a very clear case.  There is no homosexuality in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah.  The gay sex interpretation is a modern interpretation.  Post Reformation.\n\nEdit: to be clear, it is my own take that the girls are not virgins at all.  Sure, Dad makes the claim.  But we're talking about the twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and these girls are virgins?  The same girls that take turns having sex with Dad because they are in a place without men for two weeks?  Pretty strange move for a couple of virgins.  The could simply wait until they get somewhere new, but no, they need to have sex now!  Dad is just bullshitting the crowd.  The girls live in the city, the crowd knows them and him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I don't see context indicating murder.\n\nYeah, but that's the point.  The context of the ancient world is completely lost.  The context of hospitality laws are lost.  The context of how one is required to treat a visitor or guest is lost.  Modern people are not aware of the taboo against assaulting a guest.  Honestly though, is the modern interpretation that they were going to homosexually rape the visitors but let them live?  Rape them and then have a party?  Rape them and then send them on their way?  No, the gay sex part is just sensationalism added by the homophobes of the modern era.  It's the assault that is the crime.  To abuse a guest is a high crime in the ancient world.  Offering them boys or girls for sex is considered hospitality.  The modern world has no context for this so the story gets altered to fit modern sensibilities.  We don't have any problem with murdering visitors, although we tend to take their children first.  We have a huge hang-up about gay sex, but killing/robbing/enslaving/exploiting poor refugees is practically policy.",

Evangelicals have twisted this to claim that Jesus was talking about a gate in Israel NAMED eye of the needle. But hold up. Is that what Jesus said? And what was the context of him uttering this quote in the first place?\n\nWell, a rich man walks up to him and asks him how to get into heaven. He tells him to follow God's commandments and lists them (don't steal, love your neighbor, etc.) The rich man replies that he already does that and asks what more he can do. Jesus tells him to relinquish his possessions and follow him. The rich man starts to walk away disappointed, because he doesn't want to do that. As he's walking away, Jesus tells him that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into hevean.\n\nIt is pretty clear from the context that Jesus says exactly what he means here. I'm no Christian either. I do keep a Bible around though so when I hear some crazy stuff coming from modern Christians I can jump to the source and see what the Bible is really getting at.

He turns his concubine over to the crowd, and they rape her until she collapses. The Levite dismembers her and presents the remains to the other tribes of Israel. Outraged by the incident, the tribes swear that none shall give his daughter to the Benjamites (or Benjaminites) for marriage, and launch a war which nearly wipes out the clan, leaving only 600 surviving men. However, the punitive expedition is overcome by remorse, fearing that it will cause the extinction of an entire tribe. They circumvent the oath by pillaging and massacring the city of Jabesh-Gilead, none of whose residents partook in the war or in the vow, and capturing its 400 maidens for the Benjaminites. The 200 men still lacking women are subtly allowed to abduct the maidens dancing at Shiloh.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good family friendly story about rape, genocide, murder, dismemberment, and more rape?",

A lot of us would just flip it open to whatever and read.  Made for quite the interesting camp fires.  That was one of passages we read and it stuck with me.  I remember thinking either this is all a bunch of bullshit or there is no way anyone should be taking this book literally cause its full of so much CRAZY.  I wish I could remember the one passage we started and stopped like a paragraph in and picked something else cause they didnt wanna go through explaining the meaning of that one to us.  Still surprised the foreskin one got read though foreskin wasn't fully explained during the campfire it was afterwards that I learned what foreskin was and was like WTFFF are they trying to teach us.   Some guy went around and cut off all the other guys dicks tips to marry this girl TF.\n\nLater in the early 2000s another huge mindblow hit me when I found out priests were still biting off foreskin for circumcision when one priest retired and pope came to US and it made news how many foreskin the priest had bite off in a lifetime had me just jaw to the ground.  Imagine thinking you are getting into heaven and a great person for biting off thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of baby dicks all your life....  Fucking weirdos.",

They would chop all the dead dicks off and bring them back to the pharaoh as a way to show how many enemies they had slain in battle.  (originally, they chopped off the right hand, but then they realized it was a little easy to just chop off everyone's hand (women and children) to inflate the kill count, so they changed it to dicks so soldiers could only count men killed)  There's a temple outside of Luxor with a giant carving of a giant pile of chopped off dicks as a way of showing how many enemies that pharaoh had killed.  \n\nSo yeah it's a super strange practice, but it's not like David just came up with this idea, it had been around and was pretty common at that time.",

I'm obsessed with Bronze Age history, so this part is my absolute shit because its **SO FUCKING METAL**\n\nOkay, so, a considerable number of people know that Judaism's demons were often just foreign gods, but what's not as well known is that many of them were actually previous gods from Judaism's early beginnings as a polytheistic religion.\n\nYou see, unlike the biblical narrative, archaeology has given us a pretty solid indication that the Israelites were not foreign to the region. They didn't have ancestors that came out of the east, end up in Egypt as slaves, and coalesce into a nation after an escape.\n\nNo, they emerged out of the same Canaanites that inhabited the very region that they claimed as a homeland. The gods of El, Elohim, Ba'al and Asherah were the gods of Canaanite ancestors, not foreign gods, nor demons, nor names for Yahweh, save in the future when the old folk tales were put to script as a new Holy Writ.\n\nAnd one of those \"pagan\" Northern gods of those blesphemous, hetheanous Samarians was Moloch. Now, Moloch is chiefly associated with *child sacrifice*. See, sacrificing a goat shows some nominal devotion, sure, but human sacrifice just makes sense. Do you care? Like, do you *really* care? Then you better pony up some people. Better yet, how about precious little royal people. **If you wanna win this fucking battle, you will throw your newborn son into this flaming cauldron**",

Jesus came in the second half to make sure people know they aren't bogged down by those old archaic laws as long as they believe Jesus is telling the truth about Heaven \n\nThe book of Leviticus is there to explain all the rules we used to have before Jesus freed us. Now, like Paul (I believe) said \"Not everything is *beneficial* for me, but all things are *permissible*\"\n\nedit: there's even debate about LGBT+ things in the bible, and a lot of reputable bible scholars believe that the few passages a lot of homophobes refer to are actually about rape, incest, and adultery rather than condemning being gay.",

To me it's very simple: either you take it all as the truth and nothing but the truth, apply every law 1:1 and then you better start working on yourself before turning on others because i guarantee you you don't fulfill all the requirements yourself. I could respect (not like, but respect) a radical christian that actually followed all of the rules without any hypocrisy and then complained about others, but that's not what they do.\n\nOR you do (what i think is the rational thing here) and accept that you will never fully understand the bible or gods intention, in my opinon if you are a believer you should be even more critical of Dogma then atheists are. Deriving your own values from the bible is fine, respecting it as part of your heritage, your culture, etc. is fine but you have to accept if others read into it differently or choose not to follow or read it at all. You can apply it to the real world in the same way that many tales have a moral of the story or in the same way that you can make an analogy, but \"Do/Don't do X because god wants you to\" is insane no matter if you're an Atheist or a Believer.",

They don't scream at you, they don't necessarily force anhything on you (that definitely changes once you are a member, though, don't get me wrong), they don't even say that you're a sinner - they just talk about the way they see things and if you disagree you \"don't understand it, but don't worry you will eventually\".",

He crossed Gilead and Manasseh, passed through Mizpah(AP) of Gilead, and from there he advanced against the Ammonites.(AQ) 30 And Jephthah made a vow(AR) to the Lord: \u201cIf you give the Ammonites into my hands, 31 whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph(AS) from the Ammonites will be the Lord\u2019s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering.(AT)\u201d\n\n32 Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into his hands. 33 He devastated twenty towns from Aroer to the vicinity of Minnith,(AU) as far as Abel Keramim. Thus Israel subdued Ammon.\n\n34 When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, who should come out to meet him but his daughter, dancing(AV) to the sound of timbrels!(AW) She was an only child.(AX) Except for her he had neither son nor daughter. 35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes(AY) and cried, \u201cOh no, my daughter! You have brought me down and I am devastated. I have made a vow to the Lord that I cannot break.(AZ)\u201d\n\n-----\n\nIf someone asked you for help and offered to burn something in return for your help, if you then helped that person it sure as shit seems like you are in on the deal.\n\nIt would be pretty easy otherwise to avoid a needless death.\n\nYa know.

God creates the world with intent and full knowledge of everything that is going to happen, but somehow he's not responsible for any of it. I mean, for Pete's sake, he deliberately created humans without the knowledge to tell good from evil, and then let the literal Devil talk them into disobedience. That's bullshit. He knew what was going to happen. He wanted it to happen. If he desired a different outcome, he would have laid out a different scenario.\n\nAnd then he plays a crazy game which would later grant salvation for people who simply acknowledge that they can be saved. Of course, before that he had to do a bunch of insane stuff like burning down two cities, flooding the entire world just so it could turn back exactly the way it was, and just killing a lot of people.\n\nAnd his grand plan? Turn himself into some sort of alternate entity while still being himself but not really, then impregnating a virgin, living a few decades, then sacrificing himself for himself in a quite brutal way. Not that he *had* to do any of that, of course. He makes the rules and he *chooses* it to be like that, for whatever reason. Interestingly, he also chooses what *we* have to do, which is... absolutely nothing. We just have to ask for it. I mean... what the hell? That entire spectacle just to give salvation away for free? Damn, if god wanted to forgive me for the crime he set my ancestor up to just like that, he could have simply forgiven me.\n\nI frankly don't understand where you see beauty or sign of perfection in any this. Nothing in the bible is better than, say, Greek mythology. Why people want to non-historically teach one of them in schools while the other is treated like fairy tale is beyond me.\n\nPS: oh, and... \"trust him\"? Jeez, that may be the worst part. The guy has been MIA for at least two thousand years. The only thing he left us was a bunch of corrupt religious organizations, and a factually incorrect book with lots of questionable parts. It's almost like he a) doesn't exist and was just made up by people with lesser knowledge and sub-par morals; or b) really wants to taunt us into not believing in his existence so that we won't ask for the salvation he so gruesomly gave us.\n\nPPS: sorry for the rant.

To read a thousand critiques?  Think about how many scholars you read that you agree 100% with anyway.\n\nThe issue i find that makes the bible wildly unreliable as a document meant to serve as a guide for morality is its total lack of consistent meaning over time.  Yes, the bible instructs followers to kill gay people. But there are likely hundreds of analysis that exist today about how that section is non literal.  The dude 800 years ago getting murdered for being gay because of christians waiving their bible around in justification...those analysis didnt help him.  Morality is supposedly objective and yet the bible's total failure to consistently instruct it's believers how to behave makes morality very much subjective...so...why bother?  It fails to do the job followers claim is it very purpose.\n\n>I'm gonna try and make my point in a short and effective way, but apologies if it doesn't land.  So for starters, let's roleplay. If you go to work tomorrow, I'm gonna stab a child. Who's fault will it be if I stab a child?\n\nThis analogy is pretty bad.\n\n1. I'm not god\n\n2.  If i was i would stop you.\n\n3. I would probably talk you out of doing it even if i wasnt god...doing something im gonna do anyway is hardly a big deal why not just talk to you?\n\n4. The equivalent here is if you pray to me asking me to go to work tomorrow and glory be if that comes true then you will stab a child.\n\nUltimately, if you see someone doing some evil shit you should probably intervene.  That is what a good samaritan would do.  You know, the concept found elsewhere in the bible.  The concept YHWH entirely fails to follow itself?\n\n>It's a silly analogy but that's how it's presented.\n>\nNow for the dense stuff.

Its a minor point to what i will say later but just a thought.\n>\nThey weren't Jewish. They viewed God the way they viewed their own God, and tried to worship Him as such.

You start out defining god to be good.  So god is good.  Nothing can make god bad.  If god used boulders to smash 1000 kittens right in front of you, regardless of how weird it is to see and how brutal it is to experience...god did a good thing for some reason.\n\nThis makes the hundreds of words written afterwards so much window dressing.  Particularly for me, a former christian who has heard all of it before.  \n\nBut consider...if was to run a cult...what would the first things i would want to establish?  Power.  Yes.  And how can it be maintained?  By defining oneself as ideal.  All of the abrahamic religions share this feature, its inherent.  But it is also cultlike behaviour of saying hey, dont trust your lying eyes and lying heart, even the most soul wrenching and disgusting thing god does is actually beautifully good.\n\nWell...im not one for cults.  Big or small.  Christianity is just a cult that kept getting co-opted by powerful people to control people with more ease.  Can't challenge god...and as his representative...cant challenge me.\n\nMeanwhile, this leads to the biggest sect, over a billion adherent, to the catholic church...a group infested with pedophiles who hide the crimes of their members.\n\nIf you like the belief hey thats your business.  But its not moral by any logic.  I dont respect that religion nor the cult like thinking found in it.",

When you take a dense story and translate it badly you lose a lot of meaning in the story making a bad story even worse. I\u2019ve again read several different versions of the Bible. And guess what, I didn\u2019t like the story, sure there are better parts but overall it\u2019s a bunch of actual stories condensed into three or four sentences that are then made into bigger stories for movies and kids books, but even those versions of the stories have to add tons of details in order to make it watchable.",

Go to school, network and see where one lands.  \n\nLike any job or specialized training most people drop out during the education process.  The low end graduates work small time organizations.  The top students are recruited to big time jobs.  Those who do this as a family business probably have had a good understanding of their career path since teenage years.\n\nSome Pastors or Rabbis or Imams or Hindu Swami/Master or Buddist Master are true journeymen and literally travel the world for work.  Working in one organization until their contract is up then moving on.\n\nOthers have a road to middle management.  Just look at the Catholic Church.  Its a very clear line of who moves up and gets to hang in the Vatican and who is forever stuck in Tyler, Texas or some other backwater with no prospects of job growth.\n\nIt really is just a business.

                          "text": "Catholicism was set up in such a way to keep power with the Romans, rather than the practicing Jews or Christian followers at the time. Or, it was at least _practiced_ that way. \n\nLike the concept of a Pope - Judaism and Christianity have teachers of sorts to help share the teachings of God, but no human but Jesus himself and - arguably his then-disciples - ever had any power over where a soul will go, especially from another flawed soul. This kind of power in human hands seems a little unusual from an outside perspective. \n\nThis is part of my \u201cbeef\u201d with it, so to speak - so much of it seems structured on putting power into the hands of man politically and socially in a way that just stands out compared to the other Abrahamic religions, from what little I am familiar with the others. I was raised Protestant for the record, but consider myself agnostic. Other humans weren\u2019t necessarily meant to judge each other\u2019s soul to damnation, after all - that\u2019s part of why Jesus existed - to get rid of the middle ground and leave God to do the judging without all the rituals, at least according to Protestantism. There\u2019s lots of social and cultural rules that came from other cultures and maybe even Judaism (I\u2019m not sure) that don\u2019t have much to do with the religion itself, but rules for the people, and arguably, to _control_ people. Like the concept of nuns and celibate (and even non-celibate) priests. That\u2019s a human structure for humans, and such things exist in all sorts of religions that are socials rules that you can genuinely argue are used to control people. Like why young people buck off rules around sexuality, for example - it\u2019s not actually helpful, and seems like a more harmful and restrictive use of control that doesn\u2019t need to exist.\n\nThings like Popes and Bishops were made for the sake of the Romans, and to navigate the political climate of Rome at the time - not because of an adaptation of a power structure that Jesus was preaching for. He was actually arguing for something more casual, that \u201cchurch\u201d really being a gathering of people anywhere, no formalities needed. He was threatening the current structure of how Jews did things, and wasn\u2019t exactly a Roman favorite, anyway. It\u2019s what got him killed.\n\nChristianity was spreading beyond Jerusalem, and many of Romes own citizens were becoming Christians - monotheistic, as appeared to the Roman way of adopting multiple different gods. Political unrest was part of the outside factors that brought papacy into power, and brought what would become Roman Catholicism with it. \n\nThe start and history of Catholicism is so heavily intertwined with secular power and influence that it\u2019s a political movement in its own right, which is a strange way for a religion to be practiced. I am not familiar with the Islamic half of this equation, or much on Jewish history, but this is my own understanding of all my years of church (Protestant and Catholic) and studying history in my own time and in school have had me understand Catholicism. \n\nThe fact that Protestantism exists _because_ there was so many people fed up by how Catholicism was practiced (with many complaints about its secular influence over the connection to spirituality), doesn\u2019t help things.\n\n\n\n*TLDR;* Catholicism seems and looks like a political system _first_ that seeks to put more power and importance into the hands of mortals rather than about reaching spirituality from Abrahamic beliefs, and it\u2019s history certainly proves that point over and over, especially when the birth of Protestantism is brought up. Sorry for writing a whole short essay on this. I can\u2019t bring myself to cut off more at this point.\n\n\nI hope this made sense, because the history of Catholicism is rather long, and was always something I found oddly political in a way other Abrahamic religions tended to be more subtle about, in my experience. Looking into the first Popes may be helpful in understanding it\u2019s political roots, in my opinion. \u201cPower system first, religion second,\u201d was basically how I saw it.",

I\u2019d rather segregate someone that will train their sons and daughters to exterminate people like Matt Shea types are doing right now. Today. \n\nI hate them more than I hate anything else. They are a complete waste of our time and money and won\u2019t ever be anything else. I\u2019m done with it. All of it. \n\nTheir businesses don\u2019t deserve our money. Their families can rot like the country is from them living in it. They can\u2019t see that they are the ones with the contaminated wells. They can\u2019t see that they\u2019re the assholes who moved to Arizona to the place that ran out of water three years ago but some right wingers lied to them to get them there buying up land that won\u2019t be worth four dollars an acre when it becomes a dry ass desert again. The Saudis are draining every molecule of the the water there with the republicans blessing. The republicans there just eat the asses out of right wingers who are literally killing their state. That\u2019s how stupid they are. Why save this group of humans? I don\u2019t think we should try anymore. We are wasting our time on that, too. I\u2019m damn sure tired of them spreading their filthy disease to try and get more people sick to hurt Biden and costing us money hand over fist because they\u2019re too stupid to see that they\u2019re being conned. I\u2019ve already cleaved them. They talk, I don\u2019t hear it. They whine, I slam the door. I\u2019m done with all of that.\n\nAmerican conservatism is a fascist failure of hate and division. History bears it out over and over. They\u2019ve always been the goddamn problem. Look it up. Read from 1600-present American history alone. Study European history. It\u2019s all there. The stupid is still the same. It still thinks the same way. It\u2019s the same ancient conservative thinking: ancient Borg ignorance. It has to be a genetically identifiable flaw. There\u2019s no way this stupidity is good or natural. \n\nTheir hate was born from the British colonialist scum that infested the country. The confederates never assimilated to being Americans. I don\u2019t want their bullshit or their kids shooting up my schools anymore. I don\u2019t want them. At all. They need to learn but I don\u2019t see how they can. They\u2019re a waste of time, IMO. Not sure what happens now. I guess my family, kids and grandson will be shot in their war. They\u2019ll get away with it like they always fucking do. It\u2019ll be history do-over, third or fourth round of their violence. \n\nEdit: added before done with last sentences",

That's not something that was ever painted in a positive light or recommended/commanded, it was a historical event that took place and was relevant enough to the important story to include.\n\nI do understand the general point of drawing lines, and I love to discuss this by differing to what Jesus told Pharisees that would try to quiz Him and force Him to draw lines: He told them the greatest of God's commandments (You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. ' This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself), as well as He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.\u201d\n\nIt is clear to me that we are not charged to hyper-focus on minutiae and to judge others on this minutiae.

Paul does. If you want to say that Pauline Christianity is or isn't real Christianity, that's going to affect what you say about homosexuality.\n\nNow, you might talk about Pauline Christianity as something for its time, and Jesus's original teachings as something for its time, and both make sense in context. Sure. But what does that say about what Christians should do *now*?\n\nI like your peacekeeping spirit and I agree that the focus should be on \"the greatest commandments\" than on \"this minutiae.\" The problem comes about when Christians disagree on how exactly \"the greatest commandments\" should be put into practice. Some people think loving your neighbor means being against homosexuality, and some people think it doesn't.\n\nAnd a lot of their disagreements is going to come over where they draw lines in the Bible - what parts of the Bible they think should be followed, and where they think it doesn't need to be. I think you're presenting a picture of the Bible where interpretation is easier than it really is, and it's obvious what Christians should do. But it's really not.",

The Bible isn't a book, but a library with many literary themes and genres, so if you just leave it up to the people to try and make sense of it, you'll end up with every other person having a completely different take on the same verses, resulting in lots of division and splintering. You also run into problems with Sola Scriptura, and the Bible is a product of human hands (while inspired by God), and as such suffers from Human error and fallibility. To truly understand it, you need to know the context and the original language. Thankfully, the church has done this and agreed on interpretations over the course of 2000 years so I don't need to learn Hebrew or Greek, and if something doesn't make sense to me, I can understand it's meaning through the Church",

I address everything you say, you are just shaping it to look like I don\u2019t. What are we politicians? \n\nI never said the Old Testament is not part of Christianity, the idea is that the New Testament represents how people are supposed to be acting.\n\nI think your inability to recognize what I\u2019m saying or meaning is exactly the same as you claim of me. At least I am able to genuinely say I understand and recognize your validity. You haven\u2019t.\n\nYou provided sources that I found as the first things that come up when you look for something to prove your argument. I was referring to that. But I am not trying to minimize your post, just help your approach.\n\nBecause you will claim I didn\u2019t read your post if I don\u2019t address this (which I\u2019m not going to address everything directly when you write a book and I don\u2019t have time nor feel it right to write this much on Reddit) the story of Lot is a strange one. Important things of not, these angels are not sent by God to do this, but straying from it. The idea of the lady burned, is that she was turning back to the sin, not ready to move from it. It\u2019s really hardcore, and is actually like many Jewish folk tales that try to teach lessons, in fact it is directly connected and related to them.\n\nPulling out one little story and saying it shapes God, is a dangerous and close minded way of discovering God. Especially when you examine cultural historical context. Again it would take writing essays for us to actually hash this out. I respond because I\u2019m not afraid or dissuaded by your examples, but I don\u2019t go into great detail, because of reasons listed above.",

They were just saying that they think reading that story in the *context* of the Bible makes it okay because everyone should read the Bible because God Book, whereas if the same exact story were in another book that wasn't God Book, they would want it banned. So books with that stuff in them are banned unless they are the God Book even though the God Book thing isn't relevant to anyone but them (well other religions tok but you know what I mean).",

In order to survive, you must cooperate with larger society. \n\nNot just humans, similar behavior in apes and birds. Take cleaning insects off each other, if ape A cleans off ape B, ape A expects it to be done back as good gesture. If ape B does not reciprocate, it is eventually ostricized by the wider ape community and will not get shared food or get cleaned itself. \n\nSo it's not really \"morality\" but wanting to preserve self and make your own situation better. \n\nIe if you don't want to be killed, you won't kill and will cooperate with others. Don't want to be stolen from? Don't steal. Don't want to be raped, don't rape and surround yourself by people who have the same ideas or values.\n\nEssentially if you want to reap the benefits of a society, you will conform to the morals that the community subscribes to.",

Why? \n3.\tAnd how can you, from that, achieve morality? Why is it wrong to go against the grain? \u201cBecause it hurts others\u201d, and why is that wrong? \u201cBecause it\u2019s a detriment to society\u201d, and what\u2019s wrong with that? \u201cBecause you\u2019re acting contrary to the collective culture\u2019s instincts, and that\u2019s not good\u201d.

If this is the case, what right do we have to criticize other nations for human right abuses?

God\u2019s morals, as far as we know, are unchanging and are the same today as they were 3000 years ago. So why would a moral, just god demand that his followers enslave people? Slavery is immoral now, and always has been immoral. Surely the morals of an all-powerful, all-knowing, just, unchanging god are absolute and don\u2019t change with the wind.

Something that examines the Bible through its original translation and cultural historical background.\n\nAlso Jesus\u2019 values are not opposite. It is the way people in the Old Testament took God that needed corrected. The great thing about the Bible is it isn\u2019t some golden tablet written by God. But a book written by people.

It is clear you have not tried to interpret the text, but have heard people explain it.\n\nI don\u2019t have time to continue this unnecessarily long convo, but I do appreciate it. I linked the first free and available commentary on the web for you, would you like me to recommend my favorites of Deuteronomy? But, you don\u2019t understand how a commentary works whatsoever. They explain why the KJV is the way it is, I agree it is amongst some of the lowest translations. But they use original Hebrew, and Greek to interpret. I literally sent you any commentary that is easily available, because any of them will give you a better perspective on the culture of the time and what is happening then how you saw it. Your theory of how awful it is, shows how you are only examining the Bible through a modern lens and presuppositions. I understand your perspective though. And I never said it was people shaking hands. Have no idea where you got that take from. Not from what You quoted that\u2019s for sure. Read the commentaries, they don\u2019t say that.\n\nDeuteronomy\nin Apollos Old Testament Commentary\nby J. Gordon McConville\n\nDeuteronomy\nin Understanding the Bible Old Testament\nby Christopher J. H. Wright\n\n\nAnd no, if you read the Bible a few times over, God never changes. Importantly, God has many attributes, he is both loving and wrathful, he is both just and gracious. We call this the mystery. The whole idea is that a human cannot wrap their heads around God being  all things at once. \nUnderstanding as well the whole idea of unity, then brokenness, Light and Darkness, and what those are trying to portray paints a picture of Gods complex and \u201cconflicting\u201d attributes. Jesus came to show what came first in Gods heart to prepare for God, but he was not without wrath. And God in all of his ways in the Old Testament is gracious and loving too. Part of understanding God (in all religions) is understanding that God must be beyond human comprehension and understanding. Not limiting him to being human-like is key.\n\nThe thing is as well, that people are writing these books. As I already stated. That means so much in so little on how we view the different genre and writing of a book, and what it says about God.",

In this particular passage, lot's daughters got him super drunk and raped him bc they lacked trust in God to give them children by normal means, it's a teaching in don't rape people, as well as trust in God.\n\nThe whole Bible is a series of events predicting and and culminating in Jesus crucified, and rising from the dead in perfect love. So the greatest principle of the Bible is Christ crucified. Risen from the dead, and is Lord over all. So trust him and love one another.\n\nMaybe that helped you see a view from a sincere Christian, not those people who are lukewarm",

Kinda like Moses), who challenged another group of people on who\u2019s god was more powerful. So to test it, Elijah put a large meat on the stone and said that if their god lit the meat, they would win the bet. If his god won, he would win. So basically him versus a whole cult of people. \n\nThe people of the opposite sides prayed for their god to strike the offering, and bled themselves for it to happen. They kept going for a whole day. When they finally gave up, Elijah walked up to the altar, and asked God to light it. In an instant it was lit. The opposing cult fell to their knees and prayed. \n\nElijah then ordered them to be killed in the river.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of Kings 1 (I think)",

The act of reading the Bible involves stopping and thinking and re-interpreting every two lines or so. Because it's 80% metaphor, 10% widely circulated oral tradition, 9% pre-middle-ages hygiene guidelines, and 1% actual black-and-white statements of morality. And even then most of those say 'morality isn't your job, leave it to God and just do your best to not be a dick' - a lot of statements people use from the bible about why certain acts are wrong I interpret as statements about the way things were, not about the way things should be. Like, yeah in biblical times it was controversial to be gay. Big news, this isn't biblical times. Get your act together Dorothy. And if you're going to act like it's all psychological, then I'll just start rattling off increasingly graphic descriptions of penguin behavior because the church also believes that animals don't have souls or free will, so therefore they didn't choose to be gay or set up prostitution rings for nice nest-building rocks",

He brought his daughters with him, but their husbands stayed behind thinking he was insane. They hid out in a cave and sure enough, the town was burned to ash. The daughters realized they may never have their own children so got their father to have intercourse with them after getting him drunk. That\u2019s all I remember. \n\nBut yeah that\u2019s the whole story of how they ended up in that position",

What is the point of having 10 commandments, or fundamental sins, when there are tons of other sins throughout the Bible that are equally capable of sending you to Hell? At least with the 10 commandments, they are straightforward enough to not require religious or linguistic interpretation. Kill someone and don't repent? Straight to Hell. Dishonor or disobey your parents? Straight to Hell. But abortion, or homosexuality, these involve readings of the original text that, through translation or interpretation, aren't quite as clear. We just have to trust what the religious scholars say. Such as mixing milk and meat. Is that even supposed to be a sin on the same level, or more just guidance for healthy living at the time it was written?\n\nWhy have only ten commandments but a myriad of other sins, each one equally capable of sending your soul to Hell if you don't repent? Why should someone who murders someone in cold blood receive the same punishment as someone who eats something a certain way? And why is using the adverb \"literally\" when there is no possible figurative connotation not also a sin?",

You realize that there are dozens of authors of the different parts and periods of the Bible, right? I don't really understand your question. It wasn't planned out from start to finish.\n\n\n\n>Either you end up in Hell for eternity or you don't. If the only basis for that is that you repent for your sins, then that is incredibly arbitrary.\n\nThis is, again, a contributing source of your misunderstanding. The beliefs of the sects vary widely on what leads someone to heaven. If you even knew what evangelicalism meant, you'd know this.\n\nThis conversation is pointless at this point, because you don't possess much of an understanding of even elementary details of the most common sects of Christianity. Feel free to have the last word if you must, but I'd recommend actually learning about the different takes on sinning, salvation, etc.",

The fact is that every single word of the bible is taken literally by hundreds of millions of people on this planet. The fact that different denominations disagree on the meaning of crucial aspects of it is problematic. That it is, as a whole document, wildly inconsistent is actually a pretty big problem because it affects the moral and legal basis for entire societies.\n\nYou say that it's a story. The problem (and point of my question) is that this \"story\" is, and for millenia has been, the entire basis for entire nations. People live, breathe, love, hate, and die because of the very specific words in this book. Countless people have been and continue to be killed because of what is in this book.\n\nFrankly, I am baffled by your insistence that the widely different interpretations of biblical minutiae excuse the contradictions, all while upholding the example of evangelicals, who are arguably the best example of biblical literalists in the western world outside of Westboro.\n\nI note that you haven't really addressed my point, which actually did not address the historicity or interpretation of the bible, which is simply this: why have 10 when there are really many? And why pretend 10 are important when all have the same result?",

Jesus was saying that he didn't come to erase the old covenant, but rather to fulfill and complete it with a new covenant (the Old Testament has many verses foretelling of Jesus' arrival). Book of Hebrews elaborates on this by saying the laws are now written in our hearts, and Paul also elaborates by rebuking Peter for trying to oppress Gentile believers with the old laws (including circumcision).\n\nJesus even says so himself right after (where accomplish means his sacrifice, the focal point of Christianity),\n>For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. \n\nHe then goes on to list the new commandments to follow, including not committing adultery in your mind, keeping your word, and forgiveness.\n\nThink of the old and new covenant as contracts. Jesus' sacrifice was the necessary terms to complete (NOT breaching) the old contract, and allow people to move to the new contract where his sacrifice was all that was needed for salvation.",

If you do them, you need to wash before touching any of the artifacts of the Jewish temple, because touching them while dirty would be a sin. Considering how the temple and all its artifacts have been destroyed, it is not possible to sin anymore by being ceremonially unclean.\n\nFurthermore, most commands in the Pentateuch are explicitly for Jews, such as commands about eating and Sabbath stuff. God has made something like five covenants in the Bible - humans are only expected to satisfy the covenants that they have voluntarily entered.\n\nActs 15 specifically addressed the early question of whether Christians must become Jews, and the conclusion by the Apostles was this:\n\n>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these essentials: that you abstain from things sacrificed to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; if you keep yourselves free from such things, you will do well. Farewell.\u201d\nActs 15:28\u202d-\u202c29 NASB1995\n\nFornication in this context is the Greek word *porneias*, which could realistically mean anything from \"sex with pagan temple prostitutes\" to \"casual sex\" to \"extramarital affairs\" to \"any extramarital sex, including Romeo and Juliet stuff.\"\n\nHate has no place for a Bible-believing Christian.

                      "text": "Let's start with the first part, that the Bible is so hard to interpret that there are multiple denominations and multiple beliefs. How true is that?\n\nThere are four meaningful categories we can make when describing differences in belief:\n\n1. Beliefs that differentiate Christians and non-Christians. A key feature of Christianity is the belief that Jesus died on a cross. If you don't believe that, you're not a Christian. This isn't about denominations, it's different religions.\n\n2. Beliefs that genuine Christians can hold, but communities don't want their authorities teaching. This is where denominations happen. Some big ones here are infant baptism and who is allowed to be a minister. I want to reinforce that at this level, differences of opinion don't make someone a non-believer. There are some who feel that way, but such an attitude is spiritual immaturity; it is not a Biblical attitude.\n\n3. Convictions. These are differences where Christians can point to the Bible and come up with honestly different conclusions. An example might be the eating of meat. Vegetarianism is not required, but does it honor God's desire more than eating meat? There is biblical evidence for both sides, but it doesn't really matter. Christians can go to the same church and not have this issue divide them, which is nice.\n\n4. Open questions. The Bible doesn't say anything about a topic and it's up to us to figure it out, if there is anything to figure out. Are GMO's bad? Who knows, but again, it's not a big enough thing to divide people.\n\nLooking over the list, denominational differences are not really important. Viewing second, third, and fourth-order issues as important is a sign of spiritual immaturity of the kind seen in Fundamentalist Baptist settings. The only differences that have eternal consequence are the first-order beliefs.\n\nNow to your second point. Why doesn't Jesus return? Of course, the Bible says that he *will* return, and he *will* sort it all out, as he will rule the Earth for 1,000 years before the final judgment. So the only question is, why not now?\n\nWe can only make educated guesses. There are some reasons why God might be delaying:\n\n1. To make a teaching moment for humanity. God might be waiting until humans have reached our peak, done our absolute best as a specie. Then he will show up as proof that humanity can't do better or as well as God.\n\n2. He is waiting until every last person on earth has heard the gospel, so as to give everyone an honest free will choice to believe in him before revealing his existence. At current missionary efforts, this could happen as early as 2060, but depends how hard it is to contact deaf communities in developing countries.\n\n3. Humanity is still improving its theological understanding of God. The last 2,000 years have been very productive in terms of humanity knowing more about the Bible and God. Biblical scholarship is  still learning things, both from the archeological side and the textual side.\n\n4. So that people (specifically Christians) will grow into being better people. Christian and atheist alike can tell you that Christians do need to do some self-improvement as individuals and as a system. This is based on Matthew 13:30, in a parable where a farmer lets weeds grow because the wheat won't grow if the whole field is cut.\n\nSorry for the massive wall of text, but your questions merit in-depth answers, and I wanted to provide that.",

I'm not sure if you are a Christian, I take it you are from the response, but some of the things you have written are classic apologist stuff and is not the result of critical thinking. Of course you will tell me that God moves in mysterious ways and it's not for us to question the almighty etc., but if he wanted man to worship him, he's done a terrible job communicating that. I have some more questions:\n\nWhat happens to babies that die in tribes that have never been exposed to the Bible? Do they go to heaven?\n\nWhat about Exodus, where God endorses slavery and tells the Jews to take their slaves from the heathen that surrounds you.\n\nWhat about the inconsistencies in the gospels?\n\nHow about the authors of the gospels? We don't even know who wrote them.\n\nDo you actually believe that there was a talking snake?\n\nIt's clear to any rational person who reads the Bible that it is full of contradictions and has many scientific errors. This is because the men that wrote it to control their population, didn't know any better.\n\nI wish you well my friend. Just think, if you'd been born in India, we'd be taking about the Hindu gods, or Iran, we'd be talking about Islam and Mohamed, or Utah, we'd be taking about Joseph Smith or medieval Scandinavia we'd be talking about Thor or Odin............ That in itself tells you all you need to know about why Christianity is just another man made religion.\n\nI mean no offense by my response. Questioning people's beliefs can often seem antagonistic but I don't mean it to come across like that.",

I completely understand your response.\n\nThe Bible has a lot of things that even if we hear the completely true explanation, we just don't *want* to believe it. We don't want to accept that some things are left out because there is not a need to know, it's just our curiosity telling us we need to know.\n\nOn my part, I do try to present things logically. Why did God allow slavery in that instance? The uncomfortable answer is that God already gave the execution order for the Gentiles in the region; allowing some to live as slaves let them possibly be saved from hell later is a very literal Pascal's Wager. It seems brutal to our sensibilities, so I understand why you would reject the Bible based on that.\n\nPersonally, I did pass through several faiths and secular worldviews before arriving at Christianity in adulthood. I grant that I was privileged to be in an American context for it, but not to the extent you might think.\n\nI could talk much about biblical scholarship about the topics you mentioned. You literally pulled a whataboutism, but I get it. There are emotional reasons for approaching the topic the way we do. As it turns out, faith (in this sense meaning your emotional approach to the topic) is more determinative than any logic or reason. If you have any questions or want to Bible thump a fundie's hypocrisy back at them, feel free to PM me.",

And we're just curious?\n\nSo it was God's moral higher ground that allowed some of the gentiles to live as slaves rather than just die, oh well, good on him then. Do you believe that it is moral to own other people?\n\nFaith is just the excuse people use when they have no evidence. My curiosity is alive and well and because of that, I have no need for faith in God. He somehow doesn't want to prove that he exists by providing no reasonable evidence, then I have no need to worship him.",

Some swelling is normal and may last for 3 to 5 days. \n\nhttps://www.tampabayabortionclinics.com/abortion-options/surgical-abortion-procedure/instructions-for-after-your-abortion/\n\nI also don't think the other commenter's link had the following verse unless I missed it. \n\n>and the priest shall say unto the woman--the LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make **thy thigh** to fall away\n\nThe thigh and other body parts are used frequently in the Bible to refer to someone's reproductive organs since doing so more directly would be seen as vulgar. \n\n>The Hebrew term often translated \"thigh\" is \u05d9\u05e8\u05da (y\u0101r\u0113\u1e35; \u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b5\u05da\u05b0)\n\n>Regarding the oath formula, there are two options to the use of the term y\u0101r\u0113\u1e35:\n\n>a literal reference to one of the most powerful muscles of the human body (figurative of strength)\n\n>a literal or figurative (euphemistic) reference to the genital area (but ultimately figurative of its procreative power).\n\nhttps://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/9264/in-genesis-242-why-did-abraham-have-his-servant-make-his-oath-under-his-thigh\n\nThe above is referring to another instance in the Bible where \"thigh\" is used in this way to describe Abraham's penis as he has a servant touch it while taking an oath. \n\nSo yeah, a common interpretation, and really the only logical one imo unless this potion somehow only attacks a woman's thigh muscles, is that the thigh falling away is a stand-in for some portion of the woman's sexual organs. And the context of it being a test for a woman having slept with another man or not means that it would then likely be referring to a placenta/uteral lining/fetus as children out of wedlock were taboo. Otherwise it's the stomach randomly swelling and a thigh \"falling\" instead of an herbal remedy, which have been a thing forever and would be  a more surefire way of determining guilt of infidelity. \n\nSome sources I used in another more lengthy comment with the person that replied to you initially. \n\nPage 156 on the right if the link doesn't take you there correctly: \n\n>The curse itself is a euphemism for miscarriage or possibly sterility. \"Thigh\" is often used to mean the sexual organs.

I don't have a description/account of an herbal medicine taken without an abortion occurring handy, but the following is some of the basics of a successful application:\n\n>Up until the 1800s, nearly every abortion was an herbal abortion. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that\nsurgical abortion began to increase in popularity and safety after Roe v Wade. Prior to,\nabortifacient herbs were as strong an option as any other when considering abortion. In the right\nquantity abortifacients can cause the uterus to contract and miscarry during pregnancy.\nThey are often used in conjunction with \u201chelping herbs\u201d or emmenagogue herbs, like mugwort,\nrue and blue cohosh, which stimulate blood flow to the uterus and promote menstruation.\nReportedly there are 525 abortifacient plant species. In the right dosage, 43% of those have\nbeen proven to stimulate uterine tissue in vitro. The wrong dosage can be poisonous in many\ncases but dosage can vary woman to woman.\n\nhttps://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1146&context=gj_etds\n\nSo for a non-pregnant woman, I believe it would just result in strong and likely painful contractions and maybe an induced period. As that says though, an incorrect dosage could be poisonous, so not causing any harm seems far-fetched to me. I don't think it could be *too* wide of a range of dosages between different women, so if getting a bit imprecise is poisonous, I can't imagine that even the correct dosage is exactly pleasant.\n\nE: Slight correction",

What do you think it's about otherwise, her belly just somehow distends if she's had sex with another man and it has nothing to do with pregnancy out of wedlock? Sounds like a weird step in logic to make when abortive herbal remedies are known to have existed far before medical procedures used today and would be more of a surefire way to determine if they had been unfaithful than some random swelling potion. It's a test for infidelity, and has the following verse.\n\n>and the priest shall say unto the woman--the LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make **thy thigh to fall away**\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordeal_of_the_bitter_water\n\nThe Wikipedia for this ordeal also has the following bit about what thigh might mean here:\n\n>Others maintain that since the word \"thigh\" is often used in the Bible as a euphemism for various reproductive organs, in this case it may mean the uterus, the placenta or an embryo, and the woman would survive.\n\nAnd since we're talking about translation errors, here's what the Hebrew term often translated to thigh would refer to in a Bible closer to the original rather than one possibly losing it's meaning in English. It's also in relation to a different use of \"thigh\" in the Bible with Abraham, who had made the Abrahamic Covenant which involves circumcision. This is basically a locked-in use of that meaning of \"thigh\" as someone's reproductive organs, along with other examples in the Bible that at least one of my quoted links references(\"progeny of your thigh\" is what I was thinking of).\n\n>The Hebrew term often translated \"thigh\" is \u05d9\u05e8\u05da (y\u0101r\u0113\u1e35; \u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b5\u05da\u05b0)\n\n>Regarding the oath formula, there are two options to the use of the term y\u0101r\u0113\u1e35:\n\n>a literal reference to one of the most powerful muscles of the human body (figurative of strength)\n\n>a literal or figurative (euphemistic) reference to the genital area (but ultimately figurative of its procreative power).\n\n>The word thigh\u2014Hebrew, yarek\u2014is a euphemism; that is, a mild or indirect word that is substituted for one that is considered too harsh, blunt, or offensive. Without question, the servant\u2019s hand was placed beneath Abraham\u2019s procreative organs (these words are also euphemisms). Whether the placement of the hand had to do with the act of circumcision instituted by God, and thus gave a covenant solemnity to the oath, is not known.\n\n>Other common words like thigh, hand, and finger also symbolize reproductive parts of the anatomy where the context makes this clear. When Abraham commands his servant: \u201cPut your hand under my thigh, and swear to me by the LORD that you will do my bidding,\u201d the servant must swear while his hand touches Abraham\u2019s organ (see Gen. 24:2, 9). The deed is clear\n\nhttps://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/9264/in-genesis-242-why-did-abraham-have-his-servant-make-his-oath-under-his-thigh\n\nI'm unaware of a test that they would use which would make a woman's thigh in particular slough off her body or why that would be particularly relevant to charges of adultery and possibly carrying another man's child. And as said above, \"thigh\" and other body parts are used in the Bible to refer to something else, I don't see why that wouldn't be the case here. Again, unless they had a potion that literally attacked the quads only. So the word thigh here seems to me to be referring to the euphemistic definition of that term, something to do with a woman's reproductive organs, very likely an abortion due to the fetus being conceived out of wedlock. \n\nSince this is off the Wikipedia for the ordeal and Stackexchange(the quotes above are from two cited sources already if you go to the link), here's the primary sources.\n\nPage 156 on the right if the link doesn't take you there correctly: \n\n>The curse itself is a euphemism for miscarriage or possibly sterility. \"Thigh\" is often used to mean the sexual organs. If the woman has sinned by illicit intercourse, her punishment is the termination of the pregnancy or the inability to bear children.\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=Nj-AkOJ9wRQC&pg=PA156#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nPage 46: \n\n>that the water of the ordeal shall go in her and an oath among thy people, [in that Yahweh maketh thy womb to miscarry and thy body to swell]\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=vbY1AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false\n\nPage 186: \n\n>\"Thigh\" is possibly a euphemism for sexual organs (it is used that way in other places in the Bible, such as referring to children as the \"progeny of your thigh\") and its \"sagging\" refers to the \"dropping\" of a fetus in a miscarriage. \n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=UYHNaY1oXQQC&pg=PA186#v=onepage&q&f=false",

If you want to use the enlarging belly as justification to mean pregnancy, as you did:\n\n>Why not? What do you think it's about otherwise, her belly just somehow distends if she's had sex with another man and it has nothing to do with pregnancy out of wedlock?\n\nThen surely you should be aware that it explain states the belly swelling happens as a consequence of the curse. Kind of weird that the woman would continue to be pregnant despite the fact that her baby just got executed by God.\n\nI like Wikipedia, and you used it as a source, but it quite clearly states that the pro-abortion interpretation is just that - an interpretation. It is not he undeniable truth as you pretend it is.  \"Some interpretations of the ordeal describe the bitter potion as an abortifacient.\"\n\n>something to do with a woman's reproductive organs, very likely an abortion due to the fetus being conceived out of wedlock.\n\nAssuming that God is cursing the women's reproductive organs, it could just as well be making her infertile, or causing pain. Maybe you could try insulting Christians by pointing out how a supposedly merciful God curses people.\n\nFurthermore, even if this ritual WAS meant to be taken literally, it doesn't change that most Christians do not literally follow the Old Testament (Maybe some sects of fundamentalists that aren't educated in theology claim to do so). Christians have not and do not practice that specific ritual, as explained by your chosen source of Wikipedia. It's been that way for like 2000 years, don't pretend this is some new thing. The Old Testament offers a origin story of humanity and the prophets and various stories that contain metaphysical truth. This is spilling over into a much larger argument, namely a challenge of why most Christians do not take the Old Testament too literally, but the point is that the \"The bible commands abortion!\" is not the epic own that anti-Christians on the internet think it is. And yet further, even it WAS explicitly about abortion, and if it WAS meant to be followed literally by all Christians, it only applies to adulterers.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a lame-ass argument that only holds value in echo chambers.",

My TLDR, literally the first line of my post, just called it ***a logical translation*** of the text. Singular, as in there are obviously others. Yeah, of course my sources call it an interpretation, that's **exactly** what I'm arguing! \n\nAnd I call out that there are multiple meanings to translated words(thigh), ambiguities in the text(a curse, swelling) that take an assumption(thinking pregnancy would be likely to be used as evidence in a case of suspected infedility) to conclude *anything* from this passage, or anything from the Bible for that matter. I also used language like \"sounds to me\", or \"my reading of this is\" in my post, clearly showing that it's my *opinion* and not objective fact like you're claiming I present it as. \n\nBias, unintentional or not, in using words like \"likely\"? Fine, yeah, I'm not exactly writing a dissertation here. But you're having to go pretty far to interpret what I said as the attack on your views or Christianity as a whole that you seem to have taken it as. \n\nMeanwhile you said that it is \"literally not about abortion\" as what I take you to mean an objective fact, you've called this interpretation and the evidence I'm putting forward for it a \"pathetic argument\", and now say that it only holds value in echo chambers. You're trying to paint me as some obnoxious ass putting out blanket claims while I'm offering qualifier after qualifier, while you do exactly what you're accusing me of! \n\nI'm not calling Christians stupid, and never would or did I say that this \"commands\" abortion, even within the standards above. I'm saying that even the Bible seems by my reading, and those of others, to have an abortion ritual described for certain societal situations. \n\nAnd yeah, by the above, I'm not pulling some gotchya on Christianity at large at least. Pretty much only the fundamentalists that you mention if anything. Nowhere did I say that Christians *now* practice the described ritual, so idk where you got that I'm pretending this is \"some new thing\" or even really what you meant there? I'm also out pulling gotchya's on Christians who are eating shellfish and mixed-fabric clothing. Again, unless it's a fundamentalist maybe. \n\nAs for the actual merits of the interpretation, I'm not even using the mention of swelling to point out the possibility of pregnancy, actually the opposite since abortions cause swelling as I pointed out to another commenter. I'm pointing out that the **context** of trying to determine infidelity makes more sense to me if it's an abortificant compared to something that just causes swelling at random. Yes, it's described as a curse, but I think it's well within the range of an ancient people to figure out that it's better to use a mixture that will have an effect specific to pregnant women rather than just a coin flip on whether swelling occurs in *any* woman. And as I said, swelling normally occurs after an abortion. So if that is the case here, the woman is very much **not** continuing to be pregnant after the \"curse\" is supposed to have taken hold.  \n\nI also already quoted at least one source mentioning the possibility of infertility based on the \"curse\" taking effect. But I think that is unlikely because of the women going through this, many likely being innocent, then being unable to fulfill their main role as a woman in those days and would be a significantly larger loss for the tribe every time it occurred than an abortion would be. It also screws the adulterous man that I believe she marries later in this passage and take him out of the reproduction game for the tribe, as well as the fact that a woman who then *does* give birth following this curse would cast doubt on the efficacy of said ritual or God's abilities. I also don't know how this would be causing pain solely to pregnant women as a means of finding them out and that alone is the punishment for the curse. The herbal abortion page I linked to the other commenter leads me to believe that they would be painful to anyone, and the aborted fetus itself would be the best, or at least better, proof of the ordeal/trial finding an adulterer as I've already said.  \n\nSo I've got abortion of the child to prove the infidelity and as punishment for the woman while side-stepping losing reproducing members of the society, the thigh relating to sexual organs as in other places in the Bible, and swelling following said \"thigh falling away\" due to swelling from the abortion and some probably harsh effects of an abortificant blend that the body's systems are having to respond to. Also that the herbal abortion would have a tangibly different effect and/or result specifically on pregnant women rather than affecting women at random, so that the people can have some level of certainty in the procedure beyond random chance and have faith God's judgment as a result. Also also not having a woman who was supposed to be infertile due to this ritual then giving birth after as evidence against it's efficacy. That seems logical to me, and based on the above factors, makes abortion a very reasonable reading of the passage. \n\nYou can disagree and think another interpretation makes much more sense, that's fine. But don't go saying I'm insulting Christians or putting forward pathetic arguments meant for echo chambers, because I haven't offered one offensive word to you while you have gone out of your way to insult me and misconstrue my words in the process.\n\nE: Word for a word, and spelling",

For example, Ex 21:15 doesn't say to kill anyone who STRIKES their father, but anyone who SMITES their father - IE, kills their father. Ezek 18:4 doesn't say to kill anyone who sins, but that anyone who sins will die, a common metaphor in the bible for going to hell rather than to heaven. Dt 21:20 doesn't say anything like that, it just says \"They shall say to the elders, \u201cThis son of ours is stubborn and rebellious. He will not obey us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.\u201d\"\n\nI'd review your list a little bit to remove at least the obviously wrong ones.",

The commentary halfway down discusses it but only in generalities.\n\nhttp://muslimprophets.com/article.php?aid=143",

It doesn't start with the beginning of the universe and all the stories mentioned in Genesis. It makes references to them like it's being spoken to an audience that already knows the stories. When read aloud, it sounds more like someone delivering a sermon. It repeats itself alot with constantly telling you how if you follow the laws of Allah you'll be rewarded with paradise and then it starts getting into laws, which are read like decrees. \n\nMohommed himself was illiterate so the Quran is supposed to be his words written down by his followers, so that's probably why it's written the way it is. It was him giving sermons day after day to his followers which is why the same things get repeated over and over.",

After all, the \"so that they can hear the word of allah\" is clearly important to why you aren't supposed to be murdering some of them, or it wouldn't have been said.\n\nEither way your holy text is telling you to murder people that don't believe your religion, which is pretty shitty even if it says you shouldn't murder *all* of them.",

You're being a dick to people *because they are calling you out for being a dick to people.*\n\nThird, every culture had a period where they were constantly at war with other cultures. Some cultures are still in that space. These references are throughout all historical texts. Hell, they are written on cave paintings. Does that mean that the archeologists who read the cave paintings want to kill people? Of course not.\n\nA book is just that, a book. Letters on paper. The history of the various texts of the Abrahamic religions, like that of *any other religious text,* is incredibly complex, and *there is no one true interpretation of the texts.* Take a look at Judaism; the religion hardly matters when compared to the culture, and the culture is what is codified in the texts and discussed endlessly. Studying, arguing over, and interpreting the texts is a large part of Jewish culture, and built right into the texts themselves.\n\nIn short, in your zeal to hate people because of the books they read, you've exposed yourself as small-minded, self-centered, hateful, and uneducated. And made everyone around you consider you an asshole. Way to let down your \"side.\"",

In it is a test of purity where if a man \"suspects\" his pregnant wife of cheating he can take her to a priest who will make her drink a concoction and if she has been impure with another man, her baby will abort. Want to take bets on how often that happened when women were subjected to this \"test\". \n\nAnd that's not to mention the times they speak about \"cutting babies from the womb\" and the infamous \"culling of the firstborn of Egypt\".\n\nThe Bible is anything but pro-life.",

No I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s fire and brimstone like you see with the televangelist but I do think he\u2019s not a \u201ceverybody just needs to accept everyone and love one another\u201d kind of person.\n\nYes the greatest thing we can do is love our neighbour as ourself. Everything else you mentioned is true as well. But if you think Jesus is a person that just accepts everyone for who they are then we must be reading a different book. He wants to make us better.",

If that wouldn't send anyone over the edge in a rage and want to go out and obliterate a universe I don't know what would. He loved humanity enough to give them the option to sin in order for free will to exist, to give them the option to reject him, and all so the love between him and humanity would be real and not forced upon them like puppets.\n\nYou also have to consider that the people he was killing were pretty horrible. The Canaanites sacrificed children on the regular. The Sodomites saw two new travelers in their city and immediately demanded to gang rape them, not to mention the fact they were involved in incest and pedophilia. It wasn't just a convenience thing. A lot of times we don't see the reason behind it because the scriptures don't always justify his reasoning. He doesn't need to give one. He owns everything, says how it's going to be, gives us free will to choose what to do despite the fact we can then turn and use that to hurt him, and if someone disobeys that he has free reign to do as he pleases. That's the blunt truth of it. But with that in mind, you also have to balance those deaths with the sheer amount of patience and love he's shown to those who didn't deserve it. Those same people that he had genocide brought down on, he also sacrificed his son for. There is nothing to say the people who weren't wicked in those regions won't be resurrected as promised just because of association. \n\nThe problem is that in society today we consider fence sitting as an option. The Bible doesn't have that. It's black or white, for or against. But regardless of what happened, he can and will bring them back if they weren't like, yknow, the ones boiling the babies.",

He literally told his son to go to earth, and to live a sinless life so that pure demigod blood could quench YHWH's bloodthirst. So Jesus, the son of YHWH, lives an absolute shite life, starves himself in the dessert, and spend his days around prostitutes and tax collectors (so much temptation), and is literally nailed to two peices of wood, by his own people, so that a murderer can be set free. The last thing this dude experienced was having his stomach gored out by a spear, shortly followed by suffocating due to not having the strength required to push himself up on the nail holding his feet to a wooden board. All while having thorns pressed into his head, and carrying his own death implement for blocks after having the flesh stripped away from his back. \n\nYHWH wanted that for his son. He wanted that for all of us, even for the smallest of sins like telling a white lie. YHWH is a god of bloodlust, plain and simple. To signify you follow YHWH, you have to drink his son's blood and eat his flesh. \n\nZombie Jesus comes back from hell and death itself, and then still has all these wounds on his body. His followers literally put their hands through the holes in Zombie Jesus. Then Zombie Jesus says \"later haters. I'ma go back to heaven so that I can be with my dad. You know, the dad that brutally punished me and had me murdered. I'm gonna go sit next to that guy for the rest of eternity.\"\n\nChristianity is a blood cult from Sumerian times. It's the same power structure as street gangs, except sky daddy forgives you because he beat his son to death so you don't have to. People who don't bow down to YHWH go to hell, where they are tortured for all of eternity, while the followers of YHWH get to go to heaven and spend the rest of their eternal existence singing praises to YHWH and his vengeant blood lust. \n\nYeah, no thanks. Sign me up for Buddhism. I'll do my best to be a good person to all living things, and maybe in the next life I'll be a cute lil frog eating flies on a peaceful pond.",

Ideas of  messiah, salvation, judgement after death, heaven and hell, free will was already in  another ancient religion called Zoroastrianism. The flood myth was  mentioned on the Epic of Gilgamesh among others.\n\nPlus there was a certain literary style that was common in Mesopotamia. The legal system didn't really exist so you make up morality stories you can tell the peasants. \n\nThen because of the structure of the  Roman Empire, this middle east/jewish religion started to spread. Once you start learning about it you wonder how people are still believing this ancient crap 2000 years later.",

They used religious practices as a way to promote public health, remember the complicated details of agricultural science (without writing), and navigate vast distances without maps. Our brains used the repetition and symbolism of religion as a way to store information, before we had more permanent methods like writing. Prehistory was only tens of thousands of years ago. A blink of an eye on evolutionary timescales. \n\nIf anything, these last few hundred years of science are far from normal. And even then, we as a society have to sexually select for intelligence as a trait in order for that trait to survive. That's hard to do when there are religious and monetary systems in place which guarantee more reproductive success than studying math does. Plus, the less educated you are, the more children you are likely to have, and the less educated they are likely to be.\n\nFrankly it's a miracle anyone pursues truth and science successfully. We still have thousands of years left in our evolution before thinking logically outweighs our emotions and instincts. Maybe technology will beat us to the punch and completely cut us out of our niche. Maybe global warming will kill us, as we weren't evolved to understand the consequences of societal actions enacted by our ancestors.\n\nThe best we can do is try our best to help people see the world for what it really is, reduce suffering as much as possible, and be grateful we get a moment of life and self-awareness in a cold and dark universe.",

                          "text": "Ok, so the option of sinning is actually crucial to free will. The Bible says God's main quality is love. He created us, and in return he gets somethin from us: love. But you can't force someone to love you, can you? They might say it, go through the motions, but you know it's not real.\n\nHe set us up with the ability to choose not to love him. There would be consequences, yes, but you still have to have that choice. Otherwise, there is no free will, and as a result any who chose to stay faithful to him... it wouldn't really be them or their choice.\n\nAs for why sin is allowed to continue, and why suffering is allowed to continue, that is a long story starting with Satan's lies in Eden which essentially translate to, \"God doesn't have the right to rule\", and ending with God letting Satan and humanity run their course without him, they eventually fail to the point the Earth would not be inhabitable without his direct intervention, and then he says \"You had your chance, you failed like I said you would, time for me to fix everything\". That point being known as Armageddon. That's the most bare bones version of it, at least. \n\nThe scriptures indicate that he feels everything that we feel and that it hurts him just as much as it hurts us. It's not something he wants, but something that has to be done to prove the sanctity of his rule.",

                                  "text": "> There's really no need for him to give us free will in the first place.\n\nI for one would be horrified at the notion of not having free will. I don't want to be a robot with no actual choices.\n\n> If he wanted love he could have created us to love him no matter what\n\nThat's like comparing rape to a healthy relationship. \n\n> If we all lived in paradise we wouldn't be questioning any of this.\n\nAdam and Eve were, and if they hadn't sinned, we would be too. All of this happened within paradise. And the questioning came from Satan before he was Satan. \n\n> Why does none of this apply once in heaven? Why couldn't he have just created us in heaven in the first place, with no ability to sin or do wrong.\n\nHumans were never meant to live in heaven. It's an entirely different conversation, but the Bible doesn't say we're all going to heaven. He created Adam and Eve on Earth, in a paradise, and told him to fill the Earth with people and to live forever. The Bible states that this was his intent for Earth, and still is. After Armageddon, the Bible states the resurrection of the dead will occur on Earth, not heaven. \n\n> The part where he's testing us is just a huge dick thing to do.\n\nSatan and our ancestors said they didn't need him. He's not 'testing' us, he's letting us live without his rule and giving us the opportunity to choose whether or not they want to live and die without him, or live by his commandments and inherit the paradise that was lost by Adam and Eve.\n\n> If he truly had the ability to create whatever he wanted, and this is what he created, that's fucked up.\n\nHe didn't mess it up. He gave us free will so we weren't just Stockholm syndromed robots, and we chose to suck. But soon we'll get back to how it was meant to be.\n\n> Why create the devil, then have the devil punish people that are doing wrong.\n\nThe devil was originally just an angel. One of the most powerful. Created very early, and possibly even the first angel after Jesus when he was known as Michael. He was not created some sort of sinning monster. He was just like Jesus. He became envious and wanted to be like God, and rule on his own. He chose on his own to go down that path. Also, the devil doesn't punish anyone. The whole \"Satan is in hell torturing people\" is false. Hell isn't a place of torment. It's not even really a place. It's a metaphor for death/sleep. The Bible directly states when Satan will be killed forever as well. Directly and irrefutably disproving the idea of eternal torment.\n\n> What if the religion you believe in will disqualify you from another religion that is actually the real God? How do you know you're following the right religion? What if me just not believing in any god is actually not disqualifying me from the \"real religion\" because im not following the wrong religion?\n\nI've gone through most religions and have done a lot of research to determine which one I felt was correct. It's not an easy one to live by. The actual commandments God and Jesus gave on how to live are very difficult to commit to in the current world. It's not some feel-good give us money and you can sin all you want garbage.\n\nThe way I am instructed to live my life by the Bible and what it actually says pretty much qualifies me for redemption in just about any other religion as well. I personally believe in a benevolent God that understands our struggles, the confusion of mass information, and that I am trying my best. I said many prayers asking to find the true (or truest) religion. If you do so, and you actively attempt with all your intent to find what God wants you to do, what religion to be a part of, or not be a part of, you will find it. If you gave it an honest and serious effort while praying for help to find it, and you \"pick the wrong one\", I personally believe that God would forgive you for that. If you're trying your best to find him, all the while asking that he guide you, and he doesn't... well then that's on him. But fully committing yourself to that search and being willing to follow through is not easy. Especially in a world where religion is rapidly becoming reviled due to the acts of \"false prophets\", and most recently in America, the GOP who pretend to be religious for votes all the while committing egregious sins and encouraging their religious followers to do the same (fun fact, the Bible says that Jesus' followers cannot be a part of politics, as that means putting their faith in man rather than God. So the GOP is actually condemning themselves with their own holy book that they never actually bothered reading).",

See Numbers 31- \"Killing of captive children and non-virgin women (14\u201318). Moses was angry that the soldiers had left all women alive\" . Moses sounds like a great guy.

Hunger and poor nutrition are, and are what needs to be addressed in America.  Again, the hypocrisy of the GOP shows.  Jesus said to feed the hungry and that wealthy don't get to heaven.

God had a specific command to kill the Midianite boys (Numbers 31:17). sometimes they spared the women they took them as slaves and distributed them amongst their tribes. but this time, God was angry at Moses that he spared women and children! When Moses finds out he demanded their deaths \"so as not to upset the Lord\" . See Numbers 31- \"Killing of captive children and non-virgin women (14\u201318). Moses was angry that the soldiers had left all women alive\" . Moses sounds like a great guy. But don't worry, of course \"God told him to do it\".\n\nChristians can try and weasel their way out of this all they want, by saying \"We FOlloW The NEw TesTameNT NoW\" but at the end of the day, even if this story is in the Old Testament, it is the same God that they claim to worship today.",

He is presented as going up to Jerusalem for the pilgrimage holidays, specifically in John, for any number of pilgrimage holidays, and in the synoptic gospels, most importantly, for Passover. Jerusalem at Passover is not the sort of place you'd want to be in unless you were really committed to doing an awful lot of ritual activity with tremendous historical resonance....\n\n>\tWas Jesus a Jew? Of course, Jesus was a Jew. He was born of a Jewish mother, in Galilee, a Jewish part of the world. All of his friends, associates, colleagues, disciples, all of them were Jews. He regularly worshipped in Jewish communal worship, what we call synagogues. He preached from Jewish text, from the Bible. He celebrated the Jewish festivals. He went on pilgrimage to the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem where he was under the authority of priests.... He lived, was born, lived, died, taught as a Jew.\n\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/religion/jesus/bornliveddied.html\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/09/christianity-judaism",

Scientists argue the question it what came before the big bang is not important due to this fact; it\u2019s outside of temporal nature.\n\nThe Church\u2019s teaching is the same with regards to God. He has always existed because he is built within the nature of existence. God pre-exists time. They are equally unsatisfying answers because they are the same answer. One just says nothing exists and the other says something must have.\n\nAs a side note, and not trying to be hostile, why is it that atheists never capitalize God? Do they reject that God is a proper noun? When I talk about a figure from fiction, I still capitalize the name, even if I do not actually believe Gimli, Son of Gloin, is a real person. It\u2019s just purely bizarre that in the same comment you reject proper grammar only when referring to God, but employ proper (or perhaps even excessive) use of capitalization when referring to The Big Bang.   Nobody talks about it, but surely you would even admit that one could find it odd?",

So you have to ask yourself, what exactly changed about Christianity over the past few centuries.  Did the dogma improve?  Were new chapters added to the bible?  Did popes issue edicts denouncing the very idea of blasphemy as being something punishable?\n\nNo.  On paper, it's still the same hateful, xenophobic, bloodthirsty death cult it always was.  As Sam Harris said, \"Religion, being the mere maintenance of dogma, is one area of discourse that does not admit of progress\".  What's changed is that its practitioners have gotten better at straight-up *ignoring* vast swaths of their own religious instruction, enough that they can actually function and operate in a modern, secular, scientific civilization.  And we can say this because there's still plenty of Christians out there who _do_ take the dogma very seriously, and it's clear that as a result, it makes them deeply horrible people tirelessly championing a return to shitty medievalism.  The more fervent the Christian, the louder they get in pursuit of this goal.\n\nIslamic nations back in the 11th century?  Same thing.  They were enlightened specifically *because* they ignored a lot of their dogma.  Then the Mongols came in and laid waste to the whole area, and the shell-shocked citizenry turned to religion to try to make sense of it all, and it's mostly been a shitshow there every since, with some notable low-religion exceptions.\n\nModern Judaism is specifically _known_ for being built on this sort of tongue-in-cheek rules-lawyering, finding creative ways to meet the letter of the pointless laws, while dismissing any spirit out of hand entirely.  The big exception of course being the deeply orthodox sects, who are an absolutely perfect mirror image to their Muslim and Christian counterparts.  It is truly not a coincidence that the more intensely religious a demographic gets, _no matter the religion_, the more they espouse patriarchal, homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, anti-science, anti-secular, and anti-democratic views.\n\nBut here's the thing: \"Is generally ignored by the people who claim to believe it\" *is not something one religion gets to claim as a mark of superiority over another*.",

They ate unclean meat, they worked on Sabbath, and interacted with prostitutes and lepers. In this greater context this line can be seen as either appeasement of the Pharisees or a statement that righteousness as defined is still required to enter Heaven and not all old traditions are to be discarded.\n\nIf you have a different interpretation, fair enough but ultimately it\u2019s a disagreement on the internet so this likely isn\u2019t going to go anywhere.",

Either it is the absolute perfect word of god and everything in it is absolutely true always, or it's all bullshit. There is no in-between. Jesus getting nailed to a cross because he dared to challenge the power structure and made Pontius Pilate look like an ass doesn't automatically make the laws in the old testament go away. Jesus wasn't the only man nailed to a cross that day, and that wasn't the only time Pontius Pilate nailed men to crosses, and Pontius Pilate wasn't the only Roman nailing men to crosses. None of the other men nailed to crosses seem to matter to anyone, so why is it special when Jesus of Nazareth gets nailed to the cross? Is it because his (not) father Joseph was a direct descendent of Solomon, son of David?

Jesus was supposed to be fully human (while still being fully divine, don't bother trying to make sense of that because it doesn't) and having NO advantage over us regular humans while he was on earth. He was supposedly subject to all normal human temptations and resisted them all simply because it was in his character to do so, and not because of any divine intervention or anything like that.\n\nA lot of places say you are born sinful, but they disagree on what that means. Because of Jesus, it can't mean you're literally born with sin, so a lot of people think it to mean that you're born with the propensity *to* sin, as soon as you're able to understand your actions and sin, you will, because it's in your nature.\n\nThis opens up another can of worms. Couldn't an average Joe just not sin and thus not actually need Jesus's sacrifice? There was a guy in the Bible who did this, actually, Enoch. \n\nThis further adds confusion. \n\nOrganized religion, specifically Christianity, should see a lot more Enochs right? After all, by raising children in the ways of Godliness, you can reduce the odds they will ever sin in their lifetime. \n\nIt's a logistical pit that most religions simply won't address.",

If everything were explained to us then it wouldn't be faith without seeing.\n\nIn regards to the second point, it is true. Jesus did have some sort of ability to not sin that we won't have at 100%. That's precisely why God sent Jesus. He's our scapegoat. Through Him our sins are washed. Since we can't be 100% free of sin, it is our faith in Jesus that will save us. However, it doesn't mean that because of that, we get to sin as much as possible (Romans:1).",

He has not really spoken with you or shown himself to you.\n\nYou actually trust your parents, your priest, your pastor... whatever. You trust a person or a group of persons who share the same belifs as you. And you all trust the people who came before you, who trusted the people who came before them, who trusted the people who came before them.\n\nIt's a long chain of people trusting people who **claim to know what god wants**. It goes all the way back to the time when some really questionable people used to say all of their actions were justified by god and even older ancestors who wrote some scripts and said they had been inspired by god. It's in them that you trust.\n\nAnd here's the catch. Every single religious person feels the same way you do. They feel they can sense god somehow, that they can hear from god. But they just learn that from other people who believe they can sense god. And there are so many groups who believe god wants something completely different from the other groups... this can't be right.\n\nUltimately, we have 7 billiion people in this world and there isn't even an absolute majority of them who believe that god expects them to do the same thing you believe god wants from you. Now why is that? Either god had some terrible PR and his plan backfired horribly or, perhaps, it was all made up by people who keep convincing each other to believe in whatever they used to claim god wanted.\n\n**That's** what you are not questioning: other people's claim that they speak for god, not god himself.",

It's not \"I accidentally got pregnant but I'm not ready to be a mother so I'll just follow this ritual and get rid of it\".\n\nIt's the trial of bitter water and it is specifically used when a woman is accused of having cheated on her husband. When she drinks the bitter water (water mixed with ash iirc) if the child she is carrying isn't from her husband she will miscarry.\n\nI'm all for pro-choice, but I'm not sure we are helping ourselves calling it an abortion ritual, as I feel it's just giving ammunition to anti-abortion people shooting the argument down. There are good arguments for being pro abortion rights, but they have nothing to do with the bible.",

Not all stories are literal. Ancient creation mythology (of *any* culture) is especially non literal. \"Myth\" isn't a dirty word, and I'm not saying there's no value in the story - myths are important building blocks of culture that we use to set our worldview and relate to each other on a base level. The creation story written in the bible is strikingly similar to other creation stories of that area of the world. This doesn't make it invalid, or even unimportant. On the contrary, I'd like to argue that the stories we tell each other about events are more important than the events themselves. The point of the fishing tale your smelly uncle tells you isn't that he almost caught a salmon that was precisely six and three quarters of a foot long, the point of the story is to convey the emotions of the ordeal; how hard he toiled reeling it in, how shocked he was when he caught a glimpse of the monster beneath the waves, and the disappointment he felt when the line snapped. Hell, I do this with my own stories. Last year me and a friend were on a dark ride (Pirates of the Deep Sea at Fiesta Texas) when the ride stopped. I'll usually preface my tale with \"yeah, someone hit the e-stop button, but I swear...\"\n- I've ridden that ride (previously Scooby Doo themed) many times in my life and never hit more than two targets in a single ride. That day I hit just about everything I glanced at. Targets were registering left and right - for once I actually had a couple moments when I'd run out of things to shoot at. So, the story I think is more emotionally relevant is that I got such a high score that I broke the game\n\nPart 2:\n\nEven if you won't concede that the creation story isn't meant to be taken literally, what the fuck kind of crazy pills are you smoking trying to tell me that God days and people days are the same length",

If it does, and the sun doesn't come up, then where did my belief system fail - faith, science or both?

I appreciate your points, but would love some acknowledgement that non-theists and theists can co-exist without conflict if both are willing to accept this paradigm.

And we have evidence that the Earth has been orbiting the Sun for it's entire history, which allows it to \"come up\" from our point of view, and explains why it happens. \n\nIt would be world breaking, quite literally, if the Sun failed to rise in the morning, and the only time to believe that would even be possible is if there is evidence for that to happen, which there is none.

He and his two daughters lived in a cave. 31 One day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cOur father is old, and there is no man around here to give us children\u2014as is the custom all over the earth. 32 Let\u2019s get our father to drink wine and then sleep with him and preserve our family line through our father.\u201d\n\n33 That night they got their father to drink wine, and the older daughter went in and slept with him. He was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.\n\n34 The next day the older daughter said to the younger, \u201cLast night I slept with my father. Let\u2019s get him to drink wine again tonight, and you go in and sleep with him so we can preserve our family line through our father.\u201d 35 So they got their father to drink wine that night also, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him. Again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up.\n\n36 So both of Lot\u2019s daughters became pregnant by their father.",

She left him and went back to her parents\u2019 home in Bethlehem, Judah. After she had been there four months, 3 her husband went to her to persuade her to return. He had with him his servant and two donkeys. She took him into her parents\u2019 home, and when her father saw him, he gladly welcomed him. 4 His father-in-law, the woman\u2019s father, prevailed on him to stay; so he remained with him three days, eating and drinking, and sleeping there.\r  \n\r  \n5 On the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave, but the woman\u2019s father said to his son-in-law, \u201cRefresh yourself with something to eat; then you can go.\u201d 6 So the two of them sat down to eat and drink together. Afterward the woman\u2019s father said, \u201cPlease stay tonight and enjoy yourself.\u201d 7 And when the man got up to go, his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed there that night. 8 On the morning of the fifth day, when he rose to go, the woman\u2019s father said, \u201cRefresh yourself. Wait till afternoon!\u201d So the two of them ate together.\r  \n\r  \n9 Then when the man, with his concubine and his servant, got up to leave, his father-in-law, the woman\u2019s father, said, \u201cNow look, it\u2019s almost evening. Spend the night here; the day is nearly over. Stay and enjoy yourself. Early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home.\u201d 10 But, unwilling to stay another night, the man left and went toward Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine.\r  \n\r  \n11 When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant said to his master, \u201cCome, let\u2019s stop at this city of the Jebusites and spend the night.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n12 His master replied, \u201cNo. We won\u2019t go into any city whose people are not Israelites. We will go on to Gibeah.\u201d 13 He added, \u201cCome, let\u2019s try to reach Gibeah or Ramah and spend the night in one of those places.\u201d 14 So they went on, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin. 15 There they stopped to spend the night. They went and sat in the city square, but no one took them in for the night.\r  \n\r  \n16 That evening an old man from the hill country of Ephraim, who was living in Gibeah (the inhabitants of the place were Benjamites), came in from his work in the fields. 17 When he looked and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, \u201cWhere are you going? Where did you come from?\u201d\r  \n\r  \n18 He answered, \u201cWe are on our way from Bethlehem in Judah to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim where I live. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah and now I am going to the house of the Lord.\\[a\\] No one has taken me in for the night. 19 We have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants\u2014me, the woman and the young man with us. We don\u2019t need anything.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n20 \u201cYou are welcome at my house,\u201d the old man said. \u201cLet me supply whatever you need. Only don\u2019t spend the night in the square.\u201d 21 So he took him into his house and fed his donkeys. After they had washed their feet, they had something to eat and drink.\r  \n\r  \n22 While they were enjoying themselves, some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house. Pounding on the door, they shouted to the old man who owned the house, \u201cBring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n23 The owner of the house went outside and said to them, \u201cNo, my friends, don\u2019t be so vile. Since this man is my guest, don\u2019t do this outrageous thing. 24 Look, here is my virgin daughter, and his concubine. I will bring them out to you now, and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish. But as for this man, don\u2019t do such an outrageous thing.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n25 But the men would not listen to him. So the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them, and they raped her and abused her throughout the night, and at dawn they let her go. 26 At daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying, fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.\r  \n\r  \n27 When her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way, there lay his concubine, fallen in the doorway of the house, with her hands on the threshold. 28 He said to her, \u201cGet up; let\u2019s go.\u201d But there was no answer. Then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home.\r  \n\r  \n29 When he reached home, he took a knife and cut up his concubine, limb by limb, into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of Israel. 30 Everyone who saw it was saying to one another, \u201cSuch a thing has never been seen or done, not since the day the Israelites came up out of Egypt. Just imagine! We must do something! So speak up!\u201d",

He said no, he's never done that. I challenge him to read it, just like that. Start at the very beginning, and keep on reading through till the end of the end. Every verse of every chapter of every book, and in the order its printed in. Told him that when he has questions, (and that he will have questions) to ask his preacher. Told him it would either embolden his faith, or ruin it altogether. Three months later I ask him about his progress, he's nearly through the old testament. Two months after that, he quit the job.

After losing their mother, prospective husbands, and homeland, these women sheltered in a cave with their father. Reflecting a lack of spiritual guidance from their father, Lot's daughters assume they will never be able to find husbands and have children. Echoing the heinous immorality of their home culture, the women scheme to conceive children by their own father, plying him with alcohol until he literally has no idea what is occurring (Genesis 19:33, 36).\n\nLot's two daughters had sex with their father on consecutive nights. Both become pregnant. The older daughter's son is named Moab, the patriarch of the Moabites, who become enemies of Israel.\n\nThe son of the younger daughter was called Ben-ammi, a name meaning \"son of my people\". He eventually becomes the father of the Ammonite people. Like the Moabites, the Ammonites would later become enemies of Israel.",

Serious. \n\nJesus talks about Hell more than Heaven, because He doesn\u2019t want people going there. The story of Lot and his daughters (what this video is about) is saying that what the daughters did is wrong and it showed how sinful thinking carried over from the general attitude people had in Sodom and how Lots\u2019 daughters probably thought what they did was normal/ worth it.\n\nNow do I think children in school should be told this story? No, not until the time comes when they\u2019d normally learn about sexual education. But I don\u2019t think they would decide to scroll through the Bible themselves, much less understand most of it, and banning a book from libraries and schools because it has to address and talk about serious, heinous stuff to show that it\u2019s wrong isn\u2019t logical.",

Then several years later he had many years worth of one night stands to find his next queen. This king was king Xerxes.\n\nLets also remember that Jesus called the \"HOATs\" (holiest of all time) WHITEWASHED TOMBS. beautiful on the outside and disgustingly dirty on the inside. \n\nAs a Christian myself this just helps prove to me that many many Republicans are using Christianity as Fire Insurance.\n\nIf Jesus were in America today he'd have millions of Republicans saying \"when will you take out those baby eatin' dem's and MAGA?\" \n\nHere's what he'd say to that \"Here's a new slogan MMKKITW!

But the thing is half these folks don't know shit about what the Bible actually says. Case in point, that short clip, and there are plenty other things just like that out there.\n\nI'm not a biblical scholar, but there is a lot of nuance and context that will take a while to convey. I will attempt to summarize and would encourage you to check for yourself as well.\n\nIt was customary at that time to care for strangers, to take them into your home, shelter and feed them.  Sodom was a fairly affluent place and some of its inhabitants felt that if they were too hospitable, that they would be taken advantage of.\n\nLot was an outsider (this is mentioned briefly) that settles in Sodom. Two angels are sent in disguise to basically see if anyone is worth saving and then to destroy the city and kill all its inhabitants. Lot meets the angels (not knowing they are angels) and asks them to come stay and he will feed them, they decline and he insists. \n\nLots neighbors find out and gather a crowd, they demand  Lot turn over the guests, he refuses saying they are under his protection, the mob demands that Lot turn the angels over or they will do worse to him\n\nNow there are several translations of this part, one translation says \"bring them out to us so that we may have sex with them\" and one that says so that we may know them or that they can be known to us, i don't have that version of the Bible so I don't have the exact wording  but it is less direct in their stated demand of sex.  One thing that biblical scholars argue here is that they were not seeking to have homosexual encounters, but to assault and demean these strangers.\n\nAfter Lot refuses again he instead offers his two daughters, the mob attempts to breach his home and the angels come out and blind the crowd, then tell Lot to gather his family and GTFO and that they will lay ruin to the city at sunrise. \n\nLot unsuccessfully speaks to his extended family about going with him and finally leaves the city. As they leave the angels give him and his wife a final warning to not look back, well she does and is turned to a pillar of salt. Lot and his daughters reach a town called Zoar, and leaves to settle into a cave because he is afraid to remain in Zoar.  In the cave, because there are no other men, Lot's older daughter decides that she will get her dad drunk and sleep with him, and convinces her sister to do the same.\n\nThere are other instances in the bible where spilling seed is grounds for death, home boy pulls out and blows a load on this chick's tum and gets struck dead, and plenty of other instances of incest... it's got a lot of crazy shit in it when you read through it...",

We can infer from context that the daughters knew it is bad what they did, if we take the passage as a factual account of what happened we know they got their father blackout drunk to do what they did but they aren't struck down or anything, they formed additional populations of people.  That would seem to suggest that the Bible does condone to some degree, in particular instances.\n\nI'm still not sure how you took away that I am not on the same page with you in thinking rape or incest are bad.

We deeply respect and it lessons and teachings can be applied to generations of all times. When people recite the Quran, we pay respect and take time to reflect. It is used as a source of therapy u could say as well. Our scholars have deeply disected it's message and stories and most of us have knowledge about Quran verses and stories in it as well. \n\nBut unfortunately I've seen with the Bible that there is a lot of ignorance and people don't have extensive knowledge about it. Also, I've seen clips of so-called \"relegious\" Christians not knowing they were listening to the Bible,  appalled and traumatised by the wordings. Even asking for it to not be played on radios. No one can dare do that in Muslim community, bcz we know its importance and significance. \n\nAlso, interestingly enough, the Quran talks about other relegions. It talks about Jesus and Moses is the most mentioned individual in the Quran. It pays respect to the Bible and Torat and advises us Muslims to respect all people of all races of all relegions. \n\nIts sad that the Bible is disrespected so much and that Christians don't know much about it ...",

Lot\u2019s daughters get Lot drunk and rape him in a cave as he\u2019s passed out, and each get pregnant and bear sons.\n\nAnd what do Christians take away from this story? That Sodom and Gomorrah are smote by God for being sinful cities. Because of gay people being punished or some stupid shit they can put on their picket signs. Like they didn\u2019t read the story at all. Or the other \u201cmoral\u201d of the story is that Lot and his family were the only righteous people in the whole city. A father who would let his daughters get gang raped, daughters who end up raping their father, or a wife who gets destroyed by God for turning her head the wrong way.\n\nMost Christians will say that these aspects of the story are out of context, but what\u2019s out of context is them picking and choosing only parts of the story they want to use for their agenda and pretending the rest doesn\u2019t exist or doesn\u2019t matter.",

      "text": "This is super-easy to trip up MAGA-heads and prudes because they're pretty much all just idiots and hypocrites.  The Bible has all sorts of extremely violent, deviant, and unpleasant things events depicted in it, and that's generally the only rationale these folks use when trying to ban books (or shame gay folks or whatever it is).  Context doesn't matter, just the unpleasantness itself is something to avoid \"to protect the children\".\n\nWhat's more interesting to me, though, is actually digging into what the context of the Bible really is.  I challenged a Christian friend in college with the story of Lot's daughters along the lines of \"the Bible isn't just a nice book full of nice messages\", and she was shaken.  The next day she came back to me explaining that her mother had told her (over the phone the night before) that Lot's daughters' incest formed the foundation of Moab and Ammon, which were wicked peoples who were destroyed by the Israelites... and so the Bible is clearly saying that the incest was bad because resulted in bad people.  She was a smart person, but I could tell she was just holding on to the explanation she was given because it was comforting that the Bible was still telling a story with a moral.\n\nI mean... yes.  That's definitely the context of the story.  But this is where the Bible *is actually interesting* in what role it plays to modern people, because it's inescapable at that point that what you're reading is ancient political propaganda.  Israelites were calling their neighboring rivals the products of incest and rape in exactly the same way that racists and xenophobes today insult people from other countries with stupid stereotypes and names.\n\nIf you're a Christian or Jewish and you accept the Bible's multifaceted origin of (among other things) pathetic and petty state-sponsored justifications for genocide, then that's fine.  You can still believe in its overall message or worldview.  But it's stuff like this that really takes a sledgehammer to the people who view it as \"the perfect and inerrant Living Word of God Almighty\".",

Latin was a very common language at the time the Latin translations were produced.  A majority of people in Western Europe understood Latin until at least the 7th century: that's why the Biblical texts were most commonly in that language in that area in those times.    \n\nIn times and areas of Europe where Latin was not common, they either stuck to Greek in the case of Greek-speaking areas, or they usually produced translations into their vernacular.  In early Slavic areas for example, they had the Old Church Slavonic Bible.  They had a Gothic Bible for Gothic speakers. Etc. This is all long before Luther, of course.",

And then you have churches that are deciding what to include based on the types of canonicity these stories have to the old and new testaments. But like I said, I\u2019m not a Bible scholar, I really only have general knowledge but I can Google. The Bible is a God breathed text, but the ways sinful humans interpret it and change it are complex, confusing, and contradictive. In the end, it\u2019s also about what the churches\u2019 agenda is and what they want put into their bibles. Hope this makes sense.",

I\u2019d like to know because it says there in the Bible that \u201cAll scripture is God-Breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.\u201d 2 Timothy 3:16-17. And \u201c knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of the scripture comes from someone\u2019s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.\u201d 2 Peter 1:20-21. Although I\u2019m not going to look it up, the Bible also says that your connection to the Bible should be through you. I think the Bible is even against traditional church settings and congregations. Not sure though. God wants his people to have a personal connection to the Bible and Him, not hear what a church wants you to hear and think. If you left your church, it may have been for legitimate reasons, but your personal relationship with the Bible and God aren\u2019t tied to man made buildings and teachings. If you don\u2019t believe the Bible is God breathed, perhaps this churches teachings are what made you believe that. \u201cBeware of false prophets and teachings.\u201d",

My issue is that the Bible and Christianity is frequently attacked by \u201cthe left\u201d and no-Christian Democrats, but I question the motivation. Nearly every religious text has stories in it that are wholly incompatible with the modern day world. Indeed the Democrats use the Bible as a way to attack Republican politics rather than truly fight for what is ethical. I rarely, if ever, see criticism of the Quaran or Veda and so on from the left. Hinduism and Islam are responsible for some of the most oppressive societies in history, particularly against women. Infact I\u2019d say that some of the most oppressive instances in the likes of America today involve female Muslims.\n\nFor some reason there is a free pass on criticising Christianity. At the very least Christianity has made considerable progress in the past century, but that is not to say it has a very, very, long way to go. However there is almost zero criticism of Hinduism or Islam in the mainstream consciousness as if it gets brushed under the carpet. The same progressives who are standing up for womens rights, homosexuals etc. will not touch non-Christian religions with a bargepole.",

I think these folks knee jerk reaction is that the \"book\" the guy is talking about could possibly praise that kind of activity. Which isn't the case, but that's not explicitly said because it doesn't create a viral video. \n\nOverall, funny vid. Whats in the library though is different from what's in the curriculum.

People will see a post online talking about the bad things in the bible and people will say thats awful why should we be reading this. The Bible is a narrative and is told as a story and most of the Old Testament is Israel doing bad things and God punishing them for it. The story they are referring to is when Lot\u2019s daughters flee Sodom after it being destroyed and hide in a cave. They believed they were the only survivors and since they wanted to guarantee kids for themselves, they get Lot drunk and have sex with him. This passage is literally meant for you to notice this is an awful thing to do. Now the point of this passage isn\u2019t just to show an awful thing, it\u2019s meant for you to realize that because God is able to forgive people that have had sex with their own dad, he will be able to forgive you also who has done nothing near as bad. This is the issue, people aren\u2019t understanding the true meaning of the Bible. You are supposed to find the lesson yourself through reading, it isn\u2019t always plainly stated. Although some verses do plainly state the lesson(which is where all of these popular verses come from), the majority of them don\u2019t and you are meant to find it yourself. In conclusion, I believe that society hates the Bible and Christianity because society is misinformed about the true meaning and how to read the Bible. Thanks for listening to my Ted Talk.",

      "text": "I went back and read the book of Genesis recently and thats not even the worst thing that happens in it. Let me summarize for you\n\nThe book begins with two contradictory creation stories featuring plants, Adam, Eve, and the animals. The first one says god created plants, then animals, then adam and eve. The second one says god created adam and then everything just for him. \n\nNext, it talks about cain killing his brother and running away to get a wife\n\nA bunch of genetic monologuing \n\nAbraham is God's favourite dude in the whole world, basically, and they talk regularly. Abraham has some conflict with his brother or something and leaves with his wife. God is like \"hey, dont worry, ill make sure you have tons of babies and get everything you want\"\n\nAbraham knows that his wife is smoking hot and the Egyptian might kill him to have her, so he tells her to tell everyone shes his sister. The pharoh marries her, gives abraham a bunch of riches as a dowry but then gets totally clapped by god for being with another mans wife. The Pharoh is like \"what the fuck man, i thought you said she was your sister?? Now my kingdom has plague. Why would God side with a liar?\"\nAbraham responds \"I didn't lie. She *is* my (half) sister, but I married her\" \nHe pulls this trick more than once in the book. \n\nEventually he really *does* get riches and favour, and is granted land on which to bury his dead and live with his herd and all his slaves, but he still has no kids. He prays, and god is like \"dont worry, i promise youll have so many grandkids, theyll be everywhere\" After so long not getting kids, hes now an old man like 70 or something, his wife decides he better have babies with a slave. \n\nHe gets a slave pregnant and a baby is born, but then his wife/sister also gets pregnant and is like \"fuck this slave, get rid of her\" Abraham prays to god like \"this woman has my baby, but so does this other woman. What do?\"\nGod responds \"fuck that slave, listen to your wife\" and so abraham sends them into the wild, where the woman attempts to dispose of the baby. I dont remember what happened but I think he lives. \n\nAt some point god tells Abraham \"I gave you a baby, now you and every man who lives with you has to mutilate his dick. Babies gotta do it before 5 days\" And they did. \n\nOutside the city of sodom is where a man gets drunkenly raped by his two (two seperate occasions) daughters, because they dont believe they'll ever have husbands and they want children.\n\nThe city of Sodom is apparently really into gay butt sex, so when they come up to a tent, where some men and abraham are talking with some messengers of god, and say \"give us some of that sweet man ass. Them messengers is sexy\" The men reply \"No! Gay is gross and these men are our guests! You should just rape my virgin daughters instead\" And give their daughters to the men. \n\nAbrahams son, Isaac, grows up and its time for him to get married. Abraham is like, \"cool, but you have to go back to where I was born and marry one of your cousins, alright?\" So they go there. He decides \"ill ride up to the well, and whichever woman draws water for me and my animals will be my wife\" Surely, one woman is extra obedient to his random outrageous demands. He works out terms to purchase her.\n\nIm going to stop now because this has gotten really long, but theres so much more. Really, its bad.",

GOD, THE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, gave his son, that came to this world and lived among men just like us. He suffered pain, humiliation, hunger and was mistreated by a whole bunch of people. But he always spread love, wisdom and taught us that we should love each other as we love ourselves, that we should forgive each other, that we should respect each other. \n\nAnd even when he was wrongly accused, arrested, Whipped and crucified, he said: \"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.\"\n\nThat's a true stories of the Holy Bible, among so many promises that God made us, that he would come for us and gives us riches and eternal happiness.  \nForgetting that the Bible taught us not to kill, not to steal, not to be jealous, to respect our parents, no to lie, not to hate. \n\nAnd here we are, making fun of people being ridiculed, tricked by a very suspiciously picked story of the Bible. \nHere we are being intolerant with the Christians for having a belief different than ours. \n\nYes, the Bible has horrendous stories, yes, some things might scare on this book, and many times it has been used as a weapon of hate and intolerance. \nBut life is sometimes horrendous, not all the things on life are pretty and cool, and even if something was once used to do bad, it doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Like a knife. \n\nMaybe you guys should think a little bit about this and rethink the way you see Christianity and the Bible.\n With all respect, I'll wait for your replies for a calm and ethical discussion around the topic, thanks for the attention.",

You can either accept the Bible as the word of God in its totality or you can cut-and-paste its content to create your preferred version. But then, it's hardly the word of God at that  point.

So we either have to conclude that God meant this to be an extinction event for humans and that human \"sin\" is the only thing that saved the human race from a vengeful God, or that God didn't view daughters getting their father drunk and raping him as a sin.  As it's described in the old testament.\n\nOr, and hear me out now, this is nothing but an oral folk tale from a few thousand years ago committed to writing maybe about ~700BCE that doesn't have anything more than cultural significance.",

If they don't do the same with the Bible, then they need to admit this whole thing is now what they say it is.

When Muslims manage to get books banned in the United States, where I live and am raising my children, I'll call out Muslims for banning books here.  When Jews manage to get books banned, I'll call that out and fight against that.  You can check out \"Mein Kampf\" today if you'd like, if they don't have it they'll get it for you through ILL.  Have Buddhists in the US *ever* tried to ban a book?\n\nIt's only Christians in America that ban books.",

She was a sweet old lady that did truly care.\n\nEventually, however, I got fed up with everyone else laughing and smirking about how they'd pulled a fast one on the teacher at my expense.\n\nI said, \"This is Math, not religious studies. I don't have to sit here and take this.\"\n\nAs I got up to leave, she threatened that if I walked out, I would lose credit for the class. I knew this wasn't true, and explained everything to the principal and guidance counselor.\n\nI could have had her fired. I could have debated her until we were both out of breath. I could have done a lot differently,   but I chose peace.\n\nSo, in short. Fuck your hypocritical comment. You are free to believe whatever you want as long as you aren't hurting anyone or forcing your beliefs on me. Which is far more often the case from religious fanatics than an atheist. \n\nAlso, aren't you supposed to forgive? Your comment sounds awfully judgmental. Isn't that your God's job?",

You generalized atheists as whiners who have to tear down any person of faith, when largely that's not the case.\n\nYou don't see atheists picketing places of business for having views not aligned with their own. \n\nWho do you generally see performing those acts?\n\nAnd before you claim I am generalizing people of faith, I am not.

To do that, we need to be able this chose to do good things or bad things. If I hit someone else, but god intervenes every time, it defeats the purpose of my ability to chose. Does that mean that other people git hit, yes, but It allows them to become stronger from that experience.

I believe that the things in the The Old Testament did happen, but they where described in ways that ancient people could understand, for example, when god made the fish in the fifth Yom, and the crawling creatures in the Six, it was the best way for god to explain how fish evolved before lizards or mammals. I also believe that there is a purpose for humanity existing on this planet, to learn, grow and become better beings. When I said I understood the historical context, I was referring to trying to understand what certain passages mean. For Example, I don\u2019t let the exact wording of certain Old Testament passages interfere with my faith or scientific knowledge because I know that some parts of the Bible are narrative history written by people using the little knowledge they had to prophesy of the coming Christ, and to learn from. To be perfectly honest, I think your right when saying that there isn\u2019t much evidence putting it above any other religion in a sense. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John might just have very detailed first-hand accounts of Jesus and his life, but of course they are heavily biased in favor of Jesus being the messiah and the sun of god. The reason I believe in Christianity myself is because I have received spiritual guidance and revelation from following what the book and my religion taught me.",

That is true, but you left out the reason it was written and context for it.  Today, we punch holes in their skulls, suck out their brains and chop them up to scrape them out. Or do you prefer the chemical bathes where we burn them alive?  (We have civilized right?)\n\nWould you prefer a storybook of gumdrops to the actual reality?

Walking and talking with man! Dying by hanging! To be resurrected again with all the wisdom of all things!! He had a son that walked Earth as well! His great successor!! He protected men from the great evils of the world AND will come AGAIN!!! The second coming!! At the end of all things, Armageddon! Ragnarok!!! \n\nLots of men wrote books about God/Gods that walked Earth. There are great Wars fought about three in particular right now, all different, but each person killing each other believes theirs to be true all the same. Fiction is fiction. Believe what you can see and feel and touch and smell. The real things. Believe me, god isn't going to protect you if a human wants steal your food, or take your water, or take your life.

There is not a correct way to be gay, the only requisite is loving your same gender. The same way you love the opposite gender. But of course your experience is the only valid one, right?

Maybe people are upset because you tell them they are unclean and their lives are wrong. You are trying to police how they should be and support a book that says they should be stoned. I think thats a bit upsetting, when people question your humanity and how \"clean\" you are.

It was written by unnamed scribes throughout time.\n\nHaving read the Bible, I can guarantee you that MOST of the knowledge and wisdom of the Bible is NOT even known today; THIS is what makes reading the Bible so profound, because you realize that most people have not read nor understood, books like psalms and proverbs.\n\nIf people had possessed all this knowledge throughout the ages, then we probably wouldn't even have the Bible today. What makes the Bible so relevant today, is the fact that humanity still has yet put the wisdom of the Bible into practice.\n\nRead through it some time: you'll be blown away by how profound of a book it is while simultaneously realizing that most of the opinions you've ever held or received concerning the Bible came from people who never truly read any of it.\n\nThe negative impression of the Bible is the result of a massive game of 'telephone' of sorts; most of what people tend to know of the Bible today, is heavily distorted and spun from the original works.\n\nThe main purpose of the Bible that one finds when completing the book is that it's a very thorough instructional manual for how to live a good life.\n\nThe racism, slavery, and sexism are many times not encouraged in the Bible, but used as references for how one should NOT act, especially when the deeper wisdom of books like Proverbs and Psalms is grasped.\n\nI felt the same way as you about the Bible until I gave it a serious read finally in my mid 30s; was blown away.\n\nNow I see that the collective anti-Bible sentiments are based in ignorance and hatred because the Bible is a piece of literature that ultimately seeks to improve the lives of its readers.\n\nAs a voracious reader my entire life, I must say that the Bible may be one of the best books I've ever read. A very well-known and wealthy Jewish man, interestingly, is the one who turned me onto thoroughly reading the Bible. He is a heavily read individual, and he said the Bible was his favorite book of all time! I was shocked.\n\nThen, an El Salvadorian friend of mine who owns an indoor, vertically integrated legal cannabis operation here in Southern California deeply encouraged me to read the Bible so I finally gave it a try.\n\nI'll forever be thankful for these 2 folks as I may have never read the Bible seriously. Having the Bible by my side for the past 2 years has literally saved my life and helped me to understand my inner and outer worlds much better!\n\nI can't recommend it enough, and I don't even identify as Christian! I've received too much equally brilliant wisdom from other sources throughout life, so I just identify as myself.\n\nGood luck and God Bless",

Because you can have someone manipulative like the interviewer come up and drop these informations on you that you don't know because you don't study properly. And I don't force my religion on anyone.\n   \n          But, I would have responded with:\"oh you mean Lot's daughters? Who at the time believed the entire world have been destroyed and they were the only human beings left alive because they just escaped from f****** Sodom and Gomorrah? The only place they'd ever known, where all the other men folk besides their father were utterly destroyed!?\"\n\n             They thought their father was the last man left on Earth so they slept with him in order to procreate so they can have children to continue the human race. In other words, as illogical as that sounds consider the fact that they panicked after witnessing their hometown being turned into a f****** mushroom cloud! The Bible doesn't say you should sleep with your parents, as a matter of fact the Old testament says if you do something like that you should be stoned to death. But you're referring to two girls who just saw their entire town and their own mother turned into burned out cinders of ashe. Now whether you believe that story actually happened is irrelevant to me. It's not asking the question that bothers me; it's not providing people with some sort of context when you ask these loaded questions.",

And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dGenesis\u202c \u202d19:30-38\u202c \u202dKJV\u202c\u202c",

Or, to be honest, you are ignoring the point. The point is that Christian fundamentalists are complete and utter hypocrites who justify their hatred and bigotry by cherrypicking phrases from the Bible, while completely ignoring other sections. More fundamentally, they ignore a core tenet of the Bible, which is that only God can judge others. And as the end result they chant with bloodthirst against immigrants, gays, women seeking an abortion, even though the Bible clearly tells them \"be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you.\"\n\nAny questions, Bible Man?",

You cannot select certain phrases from the Bible, only to ignore the rest. If you do so, than that just compermises the entire truth of the Bible. How can one part be right and the rest not.\n\n In fact, I am not ingonring your point, but rather agree to it. This is not something that should be done, and if you want to have a good foundation in Christ, need to accept the whole truth, and we need to attempt to understand the Bible, then apply it to our lives. This is what we should do, but these people are clearly not. \nHowever, That's not even what I was attempting to claim earlier. I was saying, that the video gave no context to his claim. He said a section of the Bible, did he not? Did he Ellaborte? I would say no. That kinda sounds like cherry picking from the Bible to me.... \n\nOh yeah also, the \"only God can judge others is a great one!\"\n This claim that I am making is based off what what I have seen to be true. God still gave people the ability to make conclusions about other people. He still gave us the ability to have free will. I belive that we are allowed to conclude based on other people's actions, but not to judge them in a moral sense. We cannot make a claim that someone will go to heaven, or hell, based off their actions, the reason being we have also sinned. We are equally guilty, and judging another would be hypocritical. However, it can be said, some people we can make assumptions on. For example- a stone cold mass murderer, would not be most people' first choice to be with. But, it is not up to me to judge them in a moral sense. I have messed up too, and as the Bible says, one sin is penalty by death. Technically, the stone cold killer is set apart from God, just as I was. \n\nI just thought it worth mentioning.. I never claimed to be \"Bible man\". Im just going off what I believe to be correct about the Bible.",

Just for fun I\u2019ll recap:\n\n2 angels show up to Lot\u2019s (Abraham\u2019s nephew) door in Sodom & Gomorrah and so he invites them in for a nice dinner and what not. Good host stuff ya know. \n\nWell word gets around so all the guys in town (boys to grandpas) show up in front of Lot\u2019s door and basically say \u201chey we all want to rape your 2 guests. Let us have a go\u201d.\n\nSo Lot\u2019s like \u201cCome on guys don\u2019t do that to them! Look how about you take my 2 daughters instead and have your way?\u201d \n\nThey all say \u201chell no! Give us the angels or we\u2019ll do worse to you\u201d\n\nThen the angels blind everyone and are like \u201ccome on Lot & family, we gotta get out of here before the fire & brimstone start destroying this city\u201d\n\nSo they begin to make a run for it, but while they\u2019re escaping Lot\u2019s wife looks back at the city, which causes her to evaporate into salt. Just poof gone for lack of faith I guess.\n\nSo now it\u2019s just Lot and his 2 daughters trying to find a new place to live. Lot is worried about staying in a nearby town because he might have a bad reputation so instead he stays in a mountain cave with his 2 daughters.\n\nAfter too much time in the cave, eventually these daughters get upset that there are no eligible bachelors around and begin to formulate a plan to get their Father (Lot) drunk so they can do the business with him. \n\nWell they do, both of em, and they both conceive children from the encounters!!! And then the story ends there.\n\nLike holy sh!t what a story haha And if you don\u2019t believe this is a real story then read it yourself. Genesis 19. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23",

And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

It's so obviously not endorsed by the text, but somehow many on Reddit copy-past it here and act as though it somehow is. Well, scholarship on it shows that the purpose of the story is an etiological myth for the origin of Israel's neighbors, Ammon and Moab, basically trashing them as children of rape and incest.\n\nMany more examples can be given (even from a theological perspective, but I use historical since everyone can agree on its epistemological validity), but I'll give that one since it's most topical.",

You know like slavery s&m well I don't I don't know if Jesus was in the s&m but somebody surely was the put them up on a cross and spank them with a whip, stroke his  underarms with a spear. I am an Ally. I've had many friends and a few family members that enjoy the company of the opposite sex I have no problem with that because they love the opposite sex but that being said I think there's a lot of that kind of language in the Bible what was it Sodom in and diarrhea. LOL I'm not really good just I don't believe in God all I learn is crap from when I turn it and those damn Jesus lovers on TV begging for money and not paying taxes. I digress",

After all, besides God and Jesus,  just about every human character was flawed and ultimately unable to fully keep their covenant with God. \n\nTL:DR, the humans of the bible are not to be seen as ideal people of God's kingdom; they should be seen as examples of humanity's broken state.",

And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

The crowd cheered him on. He couldn't answer any questions.  It was obvious he never read it.  My guess is few if anyone in the crowd has either.  This is what they do.  They praise Jesus, with little clue to what is written in the bible.  They praise the bible with no clue what's in it.  It's all an act, show, BS.   Not that anyone can understand King James, with all the Shakespearean the's, thous, tis, and eth's in every sentence.",

How is it that father-daughter incest is universally perpetrated by the father, while in Genesis the roles are reversed?\"\n\nFurther reading:\n\nhttps://www.thetorah.com/article/lot-sexually-manipulates-his-two-daughters\n\n\"The reader/hearer must also imagine Lot is not so drunk as to impede his ability to have sex, but at the same time, so intoxicated that he does not notice his own daughters having sex with him.\n\nThe rabbis express suspicion about this last point (Genesis Rabbah 51:8), explaining that the puncta extraordinaria (a dot) over the word \u201cwhen she got up\u201d in v. 53 implies that the Masoretes believed that he really did know.[17] Indeed, Genesis Rabbah 51:9 quotes a sage named Rabbi Elijah Ene, who claims that really the sex was Lot\u2019s idea:\n\n\u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05d0\u05e0\u05d5 \u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05e2\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05dd \u05dc\u05d5\u05d8 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d0\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d0\u05dd \u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d5 \u05de\u05df \u05de\u05d4 \u05d3\u05db\u05ea\u05d9\u05d1 \u05dc\u05ea\u05d0\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d9\u05d1\u05e7\u05e9 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e8\u05d3 \u05d4\u05d5\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d5\u05d8 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d0\u05d5\u05d4 \u05dc\u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d5\u05d1\u05e0\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d0 \u05e0\u05ea\u05d0\u05d5\u05d5 \u05dc\u05d5. [At first,] we would not know whether Lot lusted for his daughters or his daughters lusted for him, but on the basis of what is written [in Proverbs 18:1]: \u201cHe who separates himself seeks desire,\u201d it is clear that Lot lusted after his daughters, and his daughters did not lust after him.\"\n\nEdit to add another link:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1322245/",

      "text": "The bible is a collection of letters and accounts of events, it's not a book persay. I love when people pull small excerpts from stories or news events, totally out of context,  and then use those excerpts to further thier agenda. The incident here was a story long ago in the old testament, thousands of years before Christ even. During this time in history people lived very differently than we live today. Incest was much more common and accepted because there weren't very many people on the earth. It wasn't deemed right in many places but was in many others. The example used here was the story of Lot and his family. The city he was from was a perverse place where people were doing some crazy perverse sexual things, including beastiality, rape, etc. God told Abraham he was going to destroy the city. Abraham had a cousin and his family in the city. So Abraham asked God to spare him. God had made a promise with Abraham because Abraham lived aN upright, righteous life, so he sent angels to get lot and his family our before the city was destroyed. The city was so wicked the people saw the angels when they came into the city and tried to capture and rape them. They got out but not before lots wife was destroyed for trying to turn back toward the city as it was being destroyed. Lot escaped into the wilderness with his two daughters. They were alone there for sometime and his daughters feared they would never have the opportunity to bear children, which back then was the apex of status for a young women. You were shamed for not having a family. Anyway because of their fear they conspired to get their dad drunk and sleep with him so they wouldn't go without families. After the fact, when lot found out he was sorely ashamed and rebuked his daughters. God also punished his daughters down the road. Point being his daughters were not the most upright people, coming from the city they did. They were young, probably pretty messed up in the head, growing up in that place and did something one would call common practice in the city they were raised. Also the intent of the author including the story was to show that everyone has wickedness, and skeletons in their closet. We all screw up but God will take even the flawed and use them for a purpose and bless their lives if they turn from that life. I am by no means a bible thumper, I'm not here to have theological debates...I do believe in what Christ taught. His teachings are pure flowing streams even if your not a Christ follower, but this post is really I'll informed and agenda driven. All major religions have some very questionable ancient texts.",

Out of that incestuous interaction was born the nations of the Moabites and Ammonites, wicked nations both heavy in child sacrifices and other debauchery. The context of the story is two fold... \nDoing what you think is right in your own eyes instead of trusting God's word can lead to damaging ramifications for generations, but there is also redemption because Ruth and Naomi were born from those tribes but turned away from it's practices. The lineage of messiah Yeshua (Jesus) is traced back to Ruth who was a Moabite. Moral of the story is... You can be redeemed from sin.",

I know you are going to downvote this like crazy but it\u2019s my opinion and it should be looked at freely without any body being offended by it. So have a nice day and do your research on this incredible book before listening to Justin Trudeau trying to delete all of history with him not even being able to freaking count to 10!",

You got idiots using \"Religion\" as a shield for \\[Abortion\\], \\[Homosexual event\\], and anything that goes against them.\n\nAlso, yes, a friend of mine just got abused by a catholic priest, and guess who got \"excommunicated\"? My friend, when she finally stood up. Guess what happen after that? She got kicked out at 16. Was forced to start working and making her earning. If it wasn't for the rest of us that weren't in church, she probably resort to prostitution and dropping out of school.\n\nOh, and let not forget, if a church can afford money to \"upgrade the building\", how it is that they don't open the doors to let homeless sleep in during the cold freeze weather and the hot triple digits?

Take the year 1945 for example. The United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Now we teach that in schools across the entire world. Why? To show that it's okay? No. In fact it's just the opposite, to show that it ISNT okay. The Bible does the same thing. Genesis shows a lot of the sins of mankind, to show us what NOT to do.

          "text": "So there's nothing wrong in the new testament? God is showing us what not to do but it doesn't matter if you wish hard enough? Let's start with you saying all you have to do is believe. James disagrees with you, but maybe you knew Jesus better than he did?\n\n>But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?\n\n>Don't you know that faith without works is dead?\n\n>Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?\n\nBetter get to work. Speaking of work, let's see how unpaid laborers should act. \n\n>Slaves, be obedient to your human masters with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart, as to Christ. \n\nSounds like your book says we can own people. Let's see what else Jesus had to say. \n\n>And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.\n\n>You reject God's commandment that says,\n\n>For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death\n\nSo Jesus is saying people should be following the law of Moses which includes Levitican Law and says they need to be killing more children. Got it. I'll be on the look out for disobedient children. I hope yours are behaving. \n\nHave you looked upon another person with lust? Did you pluck out your eye?  \n\nGod is the same yesterday, today, and forever, right? Why isn't he still killing world leaders like Peter's recounting of what happened to Herod?\n\n>And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost. \n\nHe must be out there killing whores though, right?\n\n>Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.\n\nI hope you haven't been out fornicating. There are loads of retellings of old testament stuff in the new testament warning people that even worse shit will happen to them. Much of it was AFTER Jesus talked about the way to the father being through him. \n\nAt the beginning of Ephesians Paul let us all know that God determined at the beginning of time who will go to heaven and who will go to hell. Sounds just and loving to me. Doesn't matter how I live or what I believe. \n\nPeter does say that God drown everyone except one incestuous family. So that's not just the OT. \n\nWomen should shut up. \n\n>But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence \n\nI've been thinking about this all powerful business. I know people have said things far more eloquently than I ever could but I'm a little concerned that an all powerful being could have snapped his fingers and given everyone the same thing that he got by killing his son. God loves blood sacrifice. Sure, that's some old testament stuff, except Jesus was a literal human sacrifice and (Ephesians 5:2) his death smelled sweet. If God is all powerful why was that necessary? Either he's a weak and impotent vassel of a larger evil entity that loves death or he's fucking psychotic. \n\nBelieve as you wish. Makes me no nevermind. You want to worship a bloodthirsty, slave justifying, woman hating, child killing weirdo who ordered people to kill their own kid then killed his own and revelled in the smell of it? Cool. Let's make some laws up appease this monster with sacrifices so shit can get back on track. If you're not down with that then please leave me the hell out of your poor convictions since you want to treat your religion like a buffet and only put the things on your plate that you like.",

The current education climate has pretty raunchy sexual topics being introduced in middle school and younger in some cases, with the intention of helping gender confused kids and sexual orientation confused kids feel less uncomfortable. Videos like this make people with genuine and valid concerns about their children\u2019s well being look foolish. We\u2019re in new ground as a society introducing these new ideas about gender and sexuality and a lot of people aren\u2019t comfortable having it taught to their kids at school, especially without being made aware of it first.",

Things like \"don't covet thy neighbor\" is tied to preventing societal strife. It better be interesting to succeed. \n\nI will also say, the biggest issue people have with the Bible is not the Bible itself but the way other people interpret it and use it out of context to justify their belief systems.\n\nEdit: All my comments are intended to get people to try and think beyond a single interpretation and recognize that their interpretation could be incorrect. In life I tend to think the interpretation that makes the most sense is the one that drives people and society to be happy is best. For actual interpretations of the Bible, there are religious historians that would be the best source. I am not a religious historian and I bet many of the people here are not either.\n\nAt the end of the day: treat others as you would want to be treated.",

But we would need to be careful or we could drift into undesirable territory. So, I think a new set of guidance is warranted; however, we (people who agree there's value there) should continue reading the Bible to assess how we've adapted.

If I ask around if there's a book which talks about a man who committed adultery then plotted to have the husband killed, and if that should be allowed in a children's school, I'd likely get the same response. But if I shared that the context was that this man, King David, did these horrible things and he was punished, but yet God still loves him and remained faithful to His promises to this man and He loves us the same way when we do terrible things, and we can still be forgiven when we repent. That changes things, right? It's all about context, which is conveniently left out.",

There are plenty of things in the Bible that GOD doesn\u2019t like or breaks the laws GOD himself has made, but GOD may have used from time to time for a specific purpose. \n\nTake slavery and The children of Israel - how they were enslaved by the Egyptians for disobeying GOD\u2019s laws, also not having faith. Also when time repeated itself and the children of Israel disobeyed GOD again and we were spread abroad and this time around only the head tribe of Israel (Judah/Blacks) were enslaved while them and every other tribe lost their identity. There are more examples I can\u2019t think of at the moment including this one where Lot\u2019s daughters slept with him after Sodom and Gomorrah had been destroyed by GOD. \n\nSo to answer the question again: NO.

I\u2019m not looking at names EVERY single time I click a Reddit notification smh)\n\nBut anyways: Basically Sodom and Gomorrah had just been destroyed by GOD because of how much sin there was in the land - a lot of homosexuality (which we know is an abomination to GOD), rebelling against GOD and his laws, etc. Before GOD had actually destroyed the land he was asked by (I believe it was Abraham) to save the righteous people that were still in the land. The number of righteous people continued decreasing and would go down from the hundreds to ten and then until there was Lot (who was a man of GOD, more info on him in the Bible) his wife and his two daughters. \n\nThe lord then sent two angles down in human form to warn Lot of the destruction he was gonna bring to the land and that Lot needed to flee the land with his family. Soon after Lot was Warned, the men of the city of Sodom and Gomorrah were outside of Lots home and they were looking to all have sex with and rape the angels GOD Sent to Lot. Lot offered his daughters for them to wife but it turns out these men were again gay and wanted the angels.\n\nIf I\u2019m not mistaken it\u2019s the angels that destroy the men surrounding Lot\u2019s home but anyways that gives them time to flee the city as GOD started his destruction. If you have read or at least heard of the story you\u2019re probably familiar with hearing how GOD told them not to look back, and then Lot\u2019s wife looks back and she is turned into a pillar of salt. So here now we have Lot with only 2 daughters by his late wife so at that point he was the last of his bloodline and his daughters knew that, so they got him drunk and slept with him so their family wouldn\u2019t die out. \n\nAlso as said in the Bible, the daughters seen that there were no men to marry because the land was desolate, empty of men",

And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father. And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.\u201d\n\u202d\u202dGenesis\u202c \u202d19:30-38\u202c \u202dKJV\u202c\u202c",

But it also points out how a loving and long-suffering God can over look sinfulness because of the love God has for the inhabitants of the world. People do bad things and God is aware of all the so called secret things. All sin is seen by God. You can hide nothing. The Bible tells a story of the redemption of all humanity. It appears even non- believers can develop an arrogant fundamentalist attitude about a book they don't understand and by doing so dismiss it and miss out on the free gift of the Gospel.",

Whereas in today's society, we know what they did was inexcusable.\n\nThere are even multiple instances wherein god must take action to repent for his own actions.  But most people wear blinders during those passages. \n\nAs for the rest of the \"good book\". Unfortunately, most Christians are unable to see the contradictions, misogyny, intolerance, cruelty, injustices, and absurdities within.   Sitting down and really committing to reading the Bible with a truly open mind (instead of constantly apologizing/making excuses) is a great way to get someone to abandon religion.",

This guy makes it seem like the Bible is condoning incestual rape.",

However,  I imagine that anyone with like an 8-10 year old's understanding of the world and reading level would get when READING THE WHOLE STORY that this behavior was reprehensible to the people of the day.  This is evidenced by the fact that both of the girls' lineages (Ammonites and Moabites) were cursed and became enemies of Israel for the most part (with exceptions for individual citizens that chose to live honorably and honor God). Further evidence is shown in the detailed laws that Yahweh later lays out in the Torah for sexual purity/holiness (ie: revelation of His heart/thoughts on the matter on a nationwide scale).",

And when dad has been found out, he turned it around and the daughters got him drunk and took advantage of him. Then obviously the men who run the place all side with the dad. Saying something like \"yeah, that sounds more reasonable, why would we belive women\" because most of them also treated women like shit and didn't want to have to stop.",
