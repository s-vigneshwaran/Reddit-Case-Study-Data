That nagging feeling that you truly didn't live up to your own expectations. Your own reality of what you thought life would be. Yet here you are, crying yourself to sleep at night, next to an emotionally vacant husband. A brat of a child needing more attention on a daily basis, sucking the life from your once youthful body and soul.\nYou want an escape, hence the skyrim and games, yet they too don't bring the level of escapism that helped ease your suffering. You feel you have not many options left, so as a desperate attempt to feel self worth, and a fleeting moment of laughs, you post on reddit, putting on your best outfit, smile and face. But please, you're getting older. That feeling will only get worse, sweetheart.",

      "text": "But you came here fishing for compliments, didn't you? I mean, you know you're good looking. I'm sure men are all trying to fuck you, and will be until you get a bit older and your loks fade. You lips are a huge asset, major DSL, and I'm sure you get complimented constantly on your lips and your eyes. You did everything in your power to show them off in this pic. \n\nSo you gave people nothing to work with and you know It. You carefully talored this post to be as un-roastable as possible. Then, to make it seem like that's not what you were doing, you wrote a btle saying you don't make money and smoke a lot of weed, acting ike it was some huge self-deprecation, except:\n \u2022 This is Reddit, people fucking LOVE weed around here. If anything, admitting you smoke ike a chimney would only endear you to most redditors.\n \u2022 Pretty girls don't need to have careers. Unlike with men, it's purely optional for girls like you, since we both know you can get a man any time you want. It would be trivial for you to get a reasonably attractive man who made over $100k a year to marry you and impregnate you, at which point the fact that you have no career becomes meaningless. \n\nThe true roast here is that you have no value as a person apart from your looks, specifically your lips, eyes, hair, and face in general. Your body is almost certainly nothing special other than the fact that you're not fat, or else you would have worm something fitted to show it off. So you're flat, probably no ass either. Just a skinny chick with a meh body and a really fuckable face. \n\nIt's pretty common for girls like you to drift aimlessly through like with no real goals or ambition because your life is already on easy mode and you have no fear of ending up in a bad place. \n\nYou mention that you're super poor, yet you smoke tons of weed. Weed is expensive. You're obviously not paying for it. You're getting it for free one way or another because of your face. \n\nYou'll spend your 20s wasting the best years of your life in that dead-end job smoking weed all the time. You'l date lots \"Chad\" guys who will fuck your face for a while and get lots of fond memories of it, but who will ultimately get bored of nutting in and on you, and move on to a more fulfiling relationship with a better long-term girlfriend. You'l ride the \"dick carousel\" in this way and waste your 20s on dead end relationships like your dead end job. \n\nIn your late 20s to mid 30s sometime, you'l panic and finally know fear. Fear of being alone and failing at life. So you'll so what all the other many, many pretty women do at that age once they realize they won't be young and pretty forever: you'll settle. You'll find a guy who makes good money who is \"good enough\" to stand being around, and you'l convince yourself you love him and lie to yourself that you're not \"setting\" even though that's exactly what you're doing. So youl get married and maybe pregnant in order to assuage your fears of aging alone and poor.\n\nBut then once your tears are gone, you'll realize that settling sucks and you'll be bored. How you deal with that boredom will define your life. Do you just smoke weed for the next 50 years? Could work. Do you cheat? Lots of drama, might backfire, or might get you an \"upgrade\" to a guy who looks better on paper and stimulates you more. Will suck for husband #1 though, as if you'd care. Do you throw yourself into spending your husband's money on things like luxuries and travel? This is the safest choice and the most popular one. Will it be all of the above? It's choose your own adventure, except this is really the only significant choice you'll be making in your life.\n\nIt's not a life l'd want, either as you, or as your male partner, but then again, I don't want to waste my ife smoking weed and living on my looks, I understand that we only live once, for a relatively short time, and die and are gone forever, so I place a bit more value on my life than you do.",
