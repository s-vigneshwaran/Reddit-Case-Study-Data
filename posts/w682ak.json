Yeah, republicans support tax cuts but only because of naked greed and not because of any grand economic philosophy.\n\nAt least Reagan and Bush believed in free trade (while being laughably hypocritical about the idea of \"small government\") - forget that now. The GOP made their deal with the devil Trump and his ignorant trash culture warriors, and now they've lost control and the inmates run the asylum.\n\n*Even Trump himself* learned he's not quite a cult leader when crowds booed him over even lukewarm support for vaccines. He learned his lesson, he'll never go against the crowd again. He's the servant, they're the master.\n\nWhich is fine for him, he doesn't give a shit about any principle or objective. But the billionaire kingmakers of the party, the Kochs and whatnot, have totally lost control. They don't decide who wins anymore, they don't decide policy anymore. The maga trash only cares about the culture war (which the Kochs etc could give two shits about). You can use your money to support a candidate, but it's going to be the maga rabble who give you a couple names to choose from. And your free trade agenda? Yeah, they're wiping their asses with it. \n\nBill Clinton was far more fiscally conservative than Trump. Even W! Medicare part D is the biggest government handout since the great society? I'm not saying it's bad (or good), just that the right are total fucking hypocrites.",

They actually believed everyone should qualify for a mortgage when everyone with an actual understanding of banking knew it would blow up in their face.

I\u2019ve had the fortune of being able to go through years of board meeting minutes, and there are plenty of discussions about how subprime mortgages and other less than qualified mortgages were a terrible idea, but the government and regulators were pushing it, so we better fall in line and make these loans. The policies were even set around limiting this risk with liquidity limits and never holding more than a small percentage of those loans on the books at anytime. Obviously not all banks fully understood the risk, but the community banks did, and the ones that worked to limit the risk from them did much better during the crisis than the rest.",
