While he was eating someone asked him about some sort of plating/padding (I forget the specifics) and he went into detail about how they were glued on. His former co-worker turned artist cut him off saying they aren\u2019t glued because of the intense heat but are instead bolted on.

She was controlling, petty, a horrible liar in that she was both constantly doing it and also really fucking bad at it, the kind of person that would refuse to admit that she is wrong even when confronted with evidence. When she kicked me out of the house at 13, she did it because I got a D on my report card. When she asked why, I shrugged and said \"I don't know\". She grabbed me by my throat (I was pretty small for my age) with one hand in front and one in back, then choked me as she dragged me to my bedroom. She threw me onto the floor hard enough for my head to bounce off of the bare wood and screamed *\"Pack your shit, you're going to live with your father!\"*\n\nAfter I moved away, started a family, etc, I had tried to maintain a relationship with her. But she never changed, and she always denied the horrible shit that she did. I have a scar on the back of my head because of her that happened when I was <2 years old. It's one of my earliest memories, and I've never told her that I remember. The story she tells is different every time, but it's always chalked up to me being a dumb baby. What really happened was that she backhanded me into the corner of a wooden toy box. So it's not like the abuse started small and then escalated. I had stitches in my head from her before I hit 2 years old. Then I found out that after I left home, she turned all of her abuse on my sister. Fuck that bitch. I hope she dies painfully.",
