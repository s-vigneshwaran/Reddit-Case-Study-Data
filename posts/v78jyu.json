  "text": "TIFU: Alexa reminded me in the middle of a dinner party that it was time to bonk my wife.\n\n\n\nSo this happened (obligatory ) last night and we are just getting over the laughter. \n\nMy wife and I are early 60s and because of old age, menopause etc etc our sex life has needed medical intervention and a new treatment was suggested to alleviate my wife\u2019s pain during intercourse. \n\nSo ten days ago, jokingly (after a few bottles of wine) we set set an Alexa reminder to announce when the treatment had run it course and we could \u201cofficially \u201c get to it.  We set a reminder. \u201cDavid it\u2019s time to bonk Fiona\u201d. It seemed bonk didn\u2019t trigger Alexa\u2019s censorship. \n\nSo fast forward ten days.  We had totally forgot this and last night in the middle of a dinner party with several friends we get the reminder. \u201cDavid reminder. It\u2019s time to bonk Fiona\u201d as you can imagine confusion reined and after a pause in the dinner party conversation questions were asked and our friends joined in on the good humour as we are all similar ages. Pro tip. Everyone gets old, things dint work as well as they once did, but please try and keep your sense of humour.\n\nEdit 1: Thanks everyone some of these comments are hilarious. I played Scotty doesn\u2019t know to Fiona (which I had never heard before) and it\u2019s now her favourite song. Unfortunately none of our friends names are Scotty. \n\nEdit 2: A gentleman never tells. \n\nEdit 3: The Aussie use of the word bonk. https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/drive/a-quick-history-of-the-term-bonk/9490694\n\nEdit 4: Apologies for the ugly mug the link dragged in. (Ex Australian Politician)  \n\nEdit 5: Seems a few people are in the same boat. My wife was prescribed Vagisan and Colpotrophine.\n\nEdit 6: Updated TLDR for those not happy with the original\n\nTLDR. During a dinner party Alexa announced \u201cDavid remember to bonk Fiona\u201d We had forgotten that we set up a reminder 10 days earlier (while drinking a few wines) to remind us that enough time had passed since my wife started her new treatment to sort her soreness during intercourse. Everyone laughed once it was explained.",

      "text": "I have a similar one. When I first got an Alexa I  made a bunch of dumbass routines just to play around and figure it out. I\u2019m a lawyer so as a dumb joke I made a routine that when I asked \u201cwho\u2019s the best lawyer in [my_town]\u201d Alexa would say my name.  She didn\u2019t stop there, though. Rather, she\u2019d go on a rant about a local lawyer I don\u2019t like. I don\u2019t remember everything she said, but I do remember her calling him \u201cthat baby dick mother fucker.\u201d Up until somewhat recently, if you put an apostrophe in the middle of a curse word it\u2019d trick the content filter and she\u2019d still say the word. So, if you typed, \u201cfu\u2019ck\u201d she\u2019d say the word with no noticeable pronunciation difference. \n\nWhen you make a routine you can designate where the response happens if you have more than one Alexa. It can respond to the Alexa your talking to, or it can always respond to some other specific Alexa you designate. Most of the time, routines default to responding on the device you\u2019re talking to, but somehow this particular routine got set to always respond from the kitchen echo. I\u2019m guessing i probably changed the setting when screwing around to see how routines work. Anyway, no matter which Alexa I asked, she\u2019d respond always in the kitchen. I made the routine, tried it once, had a chuckle, then forgot about it. \n\nA few weeks later we\u2019re hosting thanksgiving at our new place. We\u2019d just eaten and everyone is just lazing around, many of whom are still seated around the table chatting, mainly the old folks like our grandparents.  I was in the living room with my brother in law and our Alexa\u2019s came up for some reason. We ended up asking her ignorant shit, as one will, which resulted in me showing some of the funny ones I\u2019d made. In doing so, I asked \u201cwho\u2019s the best lawyer in [my_town].\u201d  But, nothing happened.  I waited a few second and thought maybe she didn\u2019t register my voice correctly so I asked her again. About this time, my wife comes darting into the living room asking what the fuck I\u2019m doing. Apparently the old folks were just chilling in the kitchen when the Alexa started going on about some baby dick mother fucker.  When it finished, one had asked \u201cwhat was that?\u201d  On cue, Alexa started all over again from me having asked a second time, confused because she wasnt responding. The good news is that they just went back to talking and no one ever said a thing. I don\u2019t know if they were too old to hear, forgot, or didn\u2019t care.  \n\n\nTL;DR: Made a custom Alexa routine that told me and my wife\u2019s grandparents that a local lawyer is a \u201cbaby dick mother fucker\u201d among other things.  Twice.",
