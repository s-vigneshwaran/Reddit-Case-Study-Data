De Villepin french foreign affairs minister did one of the most known speech at the UN, saying it will distabilize the whole region for decades. Americans said fuck off, and it has distabilized the near and middle east for decades.\n\nEDIT: here is the beginning of this famous speech:\n\n\"At a time when the fractures of the world, hatred and intolerance, the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction threaten, we must build together a world of peace, offering each person his or her place, respecting all cultures. Faced with all these challenges, the world is hesitating about the path to follow. On the one hand, there is the temptation to use force, to take unilateral and preventive action. On the other hand, there is a desire for justice and dialogue, based on the rule of law and the legitimacy of international action, which only the United Nations can provide. Today, all concerns converge on the Middle East, at the heart of so much suffering and injury. How can we fail to understand the pain and sorrow sung by so many poets of Arab modernity, since the time of Ahmed Chawki and Khalil Moutran, those that resound through the voice of Mahmoud Darwich: And the days get used to finding the living dead... or of Adonis, frozen by terror: I saw my feet turn into a river overflowing with blood.\"",

                              "text": "The French ambassador to the UN gave a speech saying that going to war with Iraq would be a mistake, and we had not exhausted all the possibilities of using peaceful ways to inspect and ensure Iraq disarmament, and that Iraq had more or less stuck to their end of the bargain. Near the end of the speech was one of the most powerful part:\n\nFrance has said all along: We do not exclude the possibility that force may have to be used one day if the inspectors' reports concluded that it was impossible to continue the inspections. The Council would then have to take a decision, and its members would have to meet all their responsibilities. In such an eventuality, I want to recall here the questions I emphasized at our last debate on February 4 which we must answer:\n\n\"To what extent do the nature and extent of the threat justify the immediate recourse to force?\n\nHow do we ensure that the considerable risks of such intervention can actually be kept under control?\n\nIn any case, in such an eventuality, it is indeed the unity of the international community that would guarantee its effectiveness. Similarly, it is the United Nations that will be tomorrow at the center of the peace to be built whatever happens.\n\nMr. President, to those who are wondering in anguish when and how we are going to cede to war, I would like to tell them that nothing, at any time, in this Security Council, will be done in haste, misunderstanding, suspicion or fear.\n\nIn this temple of the United Nations, *we are the guardians of an ideal, the guardians of a conscience. The onerous responsibility and immense honor we have must lead us to give priority to disarmament in peace.*\n\nThis message comes to you today from an old country, France, from an old continent like mine, Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity. A country that does not forget and knows everything it owes to the freedom-fighters who came from America and elsewhere. And yet has never ceased to stand upright in the face of history and before mankind. Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with all the members of the international community. It believes in our ability to build together a better world.\n\nThank you.\" \n\nAnd out media and the Bush regime used France as a scapegoat, stirred up shit and the American public -because we are mindless zombified morons - went apeshit on France. The thing is that everyone at that table on that day in the UN knew we were lying out of our lily white teeth, they knew we are going to war not because we had no choice. No one sitting on that table were stupid. It was blindingly obvious that we went to war because we could, because we were (and still are) bullies and can do whatever shit we want, and no one can challenge us, no one can stop us.\n\nIn the end, we went to war and fucked everything up anyway. We are a bunch of irresponsible, violent, stupid, stupid people that honestly should not even be given the keys to a boat, much less a supercarrier and nuclear weapons.",

I even mentioned that a permanent independent military was in our financial interests.\n\nAlso, yes, obviously the Soviets did the heavy lifting in WW2. I never said the U.S. did or even implied it. Stop arguing against an imaginary talking point I didn't make. ( I understand many of the \"ignorant\" Americans you hate so much tend to say that. sorry.)\n\nWe were \"dragged into it\" because our closest allies, biggest trading partners and burgeoning global economic systems kept descending into war. Do you think the U.S. had no business in Europe at all? \n\n\\>Not really the US took the place of the UK as the top dog of the world but it was hardly to avoid Europe dragging u into wars since we didn't u came in on your own. Rather it was to grow your own empire \"Monroe doctrine\" and spreading \"freedom and democracy\" through contra's and bombers. So cut your high and mighty historically ignorant crap.\n\nIt's easy enough to refute the \"Ignorant American\" stereotype, which holds the U.S. military is a force of benevolent good, and the wars we fight now are all for freedom. But it's fascinating to see Europeans confidently proclaim they know for sure our military's interests have always been purely malevolent, and never for a moment want to actually \"help\" anyone. Obviously the modern military blunders of the American empire are perfect examples of the latter. But really? You believe everything the U.S. has done is an example of war profiteering evil? That's just as childish as assuming its all out of a desire to see freedom and democracy. \n\n\\>See I despise the Chinese but arrogant people like u make me utter \"perhaps one day those same European millitaries will visit the US, perhaps with the Chinese and Russians coming from the other side, who knows!\"\n\nJesus christ you fucking lunatic. \n\nI tried to share an funny thought about how the U.S. government feared continued instability in Europe as \\*one factor\\* in the decision making that led to becoming the creature we are today. History is funny, and who knows if Europe, craving stability in a world destabilized now by the U.S. could end up in the same position \\*eventually\\*. \n\nAnd you're over here fantasizing about another world war, where you get to come over here and kill everyone in my country.

We're a continental fortress, and no army could have effectively mounted a sustained attack on our mainland. Add on top of that the industrial capacity we possessed during WWI and WWII, the well-armed populace, the ability to raise a massive army in a short time, and the fact that large swaths of America are difficult to traverse without a bunch of pissed-off Americans shooting at you, and it becomes clear that we could have kept selling guns to Europe and let them tear themselves down. It's worth noting that our war with Japan was unsustainable on their part, and we'd have probably won it faster if we didn't have to focus resources to Europe.",

I'm sure that the U.S. killed lots of bad guys there (actually a false oversimplification, but I'm trying to use your terms), and look at what its happening now: After \\~15 years the US has pulled out leaving things just worse behind. Another war for them, lots of infrastructure destroyed, lots of people killed, nothing got better. The US had thrown billions of USD, tens of thousands of soldiers and state of the art military equipment at the problem and achieved exactly nothing.\n\nI'm sure that if the US would have sent doctors and teachers (who are not trying to force western ideas like democracy on the afghanis) instead, Afghanistan would be a much nicer place today.",

The United States threatens to veto unless a US resolution is approved that would allow military action for non-compliance by Iraq.  \n\n\nNovember 8, 2002 - The UN Security Council passes Resolution 1441.  \n\n\nNovember 13, 2002 - Iraq delivers a letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, accepting the terms set forth in resolution 1441.  \n\n\nNovember 27, 2002 - Inspections resume in Iraq.  \n\n\nDecember 7, 2002 - Iraq submits a 12,000-page report on its WMD programs.  \n\n\nJanuary 16, 2003 - Inspectors discover 12 chemical warheads, 11 of them empty, at the Ukhaider ammunition storage area.  \n\n\nJanuary 20, 2003 - After two days of negotiation, Hans Blix, Mohamed ElBaradei and Iraqi officials reach an agreement about Iraqi cooperation and concessions regarding the inspections.  \n\n\nFebruary 5, 2003 - US Secretary of State Colin Powell briefs the UN Security Council on inspections. He presents evidence that the United States says proves Iraq has misled inspectors and hidden proscribed weapons and equipment.  \n\n\nFebruary 14, 2003 - Blix and ElBaradei brief the UN Security Council. Blix reports that the inspectors have not yet found any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Blix also reports that Iraq is in violation of UN resolutions concerning its Al Samoud 2 missile program.  \n\n\nFebruary 19, 2003 - Inspectors visit a factory northwest of Baghdad and tag 32 Al Samoud 2 missiles.  \n\n\nFebruary 27, 2003 - Iraq agrees to destroy the country's Al Samoud 2 missile stock. However, the letter doesn't specify a date that the missile destruction will begin.  \n\n\nMarch 18, 2003 - Inspectors withdraw from Iraq.  \n\n\nMarch 19, 2003 - Bush announces US and coalition forces have begun military action against Iraq.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom your own source.

Or his dynamic with Washington and Washington taking in his son at one point. Admittedly, Lafayette could fill a two-act hit musical of his very own. Still, that's hardly any reason to not add a line or two resolving his situation, or a bit of revision to clarify how things are truly going for him.\n\nIt definitely reads as if Lin was too afraid to let Hamilton be as morally compromised and ruthless as he undoubtedly was in reality. Granted, while I haven't read Chernow's biography, from what I've gathered, it's pretty biased in Hamilton's favor. If that was really Lin's primary source material, then no wonder some of his actions were duled down. And then with the Cabinet Battle, the next song is basically a villainy piece for the \"Motherf*** Democratic Republicans\" with Jefferson taking the lead, so framing-wise, it does reek of \"Jefferson is just undermining the story's main character\" and \"Screw the French, it's not our problem.\" \n\nAnd then there's the problem of some of the audience using the musical as a primary source.",

Basically easing up on the other Europeans enough to drive a wedge between them and the slaves. It was a ruse and they still hated them and the poor in general, but over time it was slowly forgotten that the statement wasn\u2019t \u201cHey you\u2019re white like us!\u201d It was that whole they held back a laugh.

So someone enters modern day alaska from Siberia, then the next generation goes a bit further south, the next yet again, etc, etc. And eventually all of the America's is filled with humans, but there isn't an easily definable group or individual that 'discovered' it.\n\n As with Colombus or those before him like vikings, they discovered it in the sense that their society didn't know of the existence of the America's and suddenly they knew after an individual or group among them went there and told them about it. In that sense they 'discovered' it. Just like the first Roman setting foot on Brittish shores 'discovered' Brittain. The word discovered in this context is always relative to some reference society or an entire 'known world'.",

Almost the entire world. Thousands of people discovered the bow and arrow separately , but they all Discovered it. Native Americans discovered the americas not as one group, but as most likely many tens or hundreds of different hunter gatherer tribes, and they all discovered the americas separately. This doesn\u2019t mean that the first group discovered it and that the rest didn\u2019t. They all did. The word discovery is context based, and very much time period based as well. It\u2019s not disrespectful to the many many of native Americans, or Leif Erikson lovers to say that Columbus discovered the Americas. It would be disrespectful to say he discovered the americas first. Just like James Cook and Hawaii. He did, he just happened to discover it way later than the native Hawaiians.\n\nAs for Columbus Day being a national holiday? \nI don\u2019t care. It\u2019s overemphasized in history.

Expat literally comes from expatriate, as in \"outside the father[land]\", so it only makes sense if you're from the place that they are from. Nobody in the UK would call an American coming to the UK an expat unless they were talking about it in relation to something in their homeland.",

It\u2019s also historically inaccurate because, yeah, he didn\u2019t discover shit and was lost besides. Why not honor real Italians who made real contributions to this country?",

That village is actually quite old, from the days of the Reconquista, so the name Cuba wasn\u2019t \u201cinvented\u201d for the country in the Carabeans, they claim Colombus named it for his hometown. And obviously for the fact that Colombus first addressed the Portuguese king for an expedition to the west before being dismissed and trying his luck with the Castilian court.\n\nTruth is, we don\u2019t know. Some years ago there was some papers from a Portuguese university pointing to a possibility that \u201cColon\u201d (what the name Colombus would be written in those days) was a very common romance name, and that there was possibly two or more different Colons living at the same time , interacting with both Genoan and Portuguese courts as traders. This, coupled with the fact that we will never know for certain the day of his birth, could probably explain why several Colon got \u201cfused\u201d together into a single character by historians",

In Guicciardini\u2019s work \u00bbHistory of Italy\u00ab it\u2019s even in the title (and obviously implies a sense of collective, connected history). So even though there was no Italian nation in the modern sense in Columbus\u2019 times, to say that there was \u00bbno \"Italy\"\u00ab is a bit too far a jump.\n\nEdit: Added bit in brackets in 2nd paragraph.",

Ironically, that\u2019s apparently now politically incorrect to point out for some, because it contradicts their myths that they\u2019ve always lived there since the dawn of humanity.\n\nHowever, the question who discovered the New World first is always raised as in which *European* discovered it first \u2013 and that is obviously not a coincidence. Also note the Eurocentric naming itself: Old and New World. \n\nFor the Natives, who had lived there for so long, it certainly wasn\u2019t a new world anymore and they probably only remembered the old world in vague myths, if anything. Practically, at the time, they\u2019d probably see it just the other way around. And it would be very instructive and sobering to teach kids both in the USA and in the European countries about that, to lift the confines of the Eurocentric or Eurodescendant-centric American perspective, respectively. The imperialist colonial perspective still permeates the very terminology and the most basic reading of history. \n\nIt tremendously widens one\u2019s consciousness to learn just how many things happened all around the globe around the same time and how the local people had their very own view and interpretation thereof and how different things were much more important to them. Also, how even centuries before the modern globalist world we live in today, these events were intricately interconnected. Such an international perspective is a very good way to immunise against ideologies and partial history reading.",

While being split up in a whole bunch of poleis that would concur and conflict among each other and while the people in them would usually see themselves primarily as Athenians, Spartans, Thebans etc., they still would have a sense of shared identity as Hellenes. When foes from the outside would attack, they would often (largely) unite and stand together against the common enemy, and to preserve their shared Hellenic culture. \n\nSimilarly, the various Italian states, while infighting and intriguing against each other all the time, would on the other hand share a sense of kindred and belonging as Italians. Especially at that time, when the ancient high cultures were rediscovered and the inhabitants of the Italian peninsula took pride in being the descendants of the once mighty and glorious Romans.\n\nWho had already called the peninsula \u00bbItalia\u00ab in ancient times btw, although the name dates back even farther. The citizens of the various Italian states spoke dialects of the same language and shared a common culture and religion at Columbus\u2019 time. Contemporaries would indeed commonly refer to the peninsula as Italy, e.g. Guicciardini in his *Storia d\u2019Italia* (\u00bbHistory of Italy\u00ab), which naturally implies a sense of shared history and collective identity.\n\nDon\u2019t forget another important factor: At the time, Italy, weakened by infighting and the use of mercenaries, was overrun by various foreign powers. Several contemporary politicians, with Machiavelli as a prominent example, would advocate for an alliance to drive the \u00bbbarbarians\u00ab out. In part such unions happened, e.g. the Holy League, although the old mutual distrust hampered the formation of an all-Italian union. (Tbf, Machiavelli only rallied for joint defense and reconquest of Italian territory though, not for an actual national union, as it happened centuries later, contrary to nationalist myths claiming him as their forefather.)",

While you\u2019re politely and rationally arguing against their idiotic ideals, they\u2019re engaging in bad faith tactics and constructing disingenuous arguments designed to appeal to morons \u2014 morons who could have been saved if you\u2018d focused your energy on educating them instead of rescuing fascists who don\u2019t want to be rescued. \n\nAnd you don\u2019t have to take my word for it, history shows us again and again that attempting to negotiate with fascists instead of crushing them immediately inevitably leads to unthinkable violence. Once they gain even a modicum of power they\u2019ll never let it go unless you force them to, and if gets to the point where they have access to the instruments of the state, it will potentially cost millions of lives to do so.",

Just because Wikipedia says?\n\nColombus was Spanish Castillian, and very probably from Jewish ancestry and trying to hide this fact from the raging catholic Spanish Queen that financed the expedition. Same monarchy that just kick the Muslims and Jews out of Spain. So it was a good reason to hide it. \n\n[https://www.biography.com/news/christopher-columbus-heritage-nationality](https://www.biography.com/news/christopher-columbus-heritage-nationality)\n\n\u201cSupporters of the idea that Columbus was from Spain after all have also gotten a boost in recent years. In 2009, Georgetown University linguistic professor Estelle Irizarry published her book, \"Christopher Columbus: The DNA of His Writings,\" based on close examination of hundreds of documents written by Columbus. According to her research, he was born in the kingdom of Aragon, in Northern Spain, and his primary language was Castilian (there are no existing documents in which Columbus used Ligurian, the common language of Genoa).\nBut if he was Spanish all along, why go to great lengths to disguise his identity? Because, Irizarry and a number of other historians argue, Columbus was actually Jewish. Linguistic traits in his writings led them to believe Columbus was raised learning Ladino, a hybrid form of Castilian Spanish, comparable to Yiddish, which was spoken by Spain\u2019s Sephardic Jewish community. They believe there is ample evidence to support their conclusions, including the existence of a Hebrew blessing, \u201cwith God\u2019s help,\u201d on all but one of Columbus\u2019 letters to another son, Diego (but which do not appear on letters to anyone outside his family).\u201d",

We\u2019re seeing it more and more in official announcements, government staff get free classes, and agencies are transitioning to use their M\u0101ori language names first in logos and in conversation (www.publicservice.govt.nz). Government meetings always start and end with a greeting in M\u0101ori (whether just \u201ckia ora\u201d or something more in depth), and sometimes even a karakia (song/recitation). \n\nMost people here couldn\u2019t hold a conversation in it, but could greet each other easily and use a smattering of words, especially words associated with important cultural events. \n\nOne example: say if someone dies in a lake or park. The area where they died might have a \u201cr\u0101hui\u201d (restriction) placed on it by the local iwi (tribe) until the tapu (sacredness) is lifted with a \u201cwhakanoa\u201d (tapu lifting) ceremony.\n\nEverybody knows this, and the associated words, and pretty much everybody follows the rules. Not necessarily for spiritual reasons, but because it feels respectful to the dead and to the family and friends.\n\nTapu is where we get \u201ctaboo\u201d from btw :-). You\u2019ll also have heard \u201cmana\u201d before - this is the Polynesian concept of perceived strength and power. Like, if someone makes fun of you in public, they might have reduced your mana. If you deal with it well, you might increase your mana.",

Usually because their cultures see themselves as superior to the militarily inferior cultures, and they either want the resources of the inferior cultures or to instill their own superior cultures. It\u2019s a really childish worldview that we are struggling to get past as a species mainly because simpletons always resort back to \u201cit\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done this.\u201d Our next epoch as a species won\u2019t come until people abandon their stupid \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset and recognize humans as worthwhile regardless of their geographic location.

Then I argue Leif was a Viking and Vikings had an impactful nomadic, shipbuilding, exploratory, war- and seafaring influence in Europe, specially at the confluence of conflict among the different traditions; many events of which took place in the British Isles or their geopolitical struggles, and therefore I think he influenced the colonization of the Americas way more than Columbus. Ultimately, I actually don\u2019t even care what people think about a POS like Columbus, love or hate him I couldn\u2019t care less. Like I said, there are many more positively impactful Italians in history that I would rather teach my kids about. What knowledge you care about is your prerogative.",

The ingredients and the recipes are more important to me than any one tomato you clumsily throw in. I don\u2019t agree that Columbus is more important than the wave of notable or nameless ship-builders, sailors, craftsmen, noblemen, clergy, et cetera, whose successes Columbus was able to ride on to find his grand moment in history; even if you\u2019d really like to label it the moment a giant meteor struck Earth. I\u2019d much rather learn more about stories of background characters behind the man, than about Columbus himself. In my opinion, they\u2019re more important and made what was possible. That\u2019s because in my opinion the evolution of seafaring is far more important in world history and to the success of Columbus than Columbus is to his success. Remove the history of seafaring, and then who is Columbus before there are ships to cross the ocean.

There were people living their already, they didn\u2019t discover anything. The native peoples discovered it when they got there first. Which early colonist would know if they didn\u2019t ignore precolonial history. Europeans arrived at these places, or started trade with these places, they were runner up in the age of exploration, and history should be taught like that.\n\nEdit: To answer some questions. It absolutely doesn\u2019t make sense to say these lands were discovered. It\u2019s factual incorrect for reasons I already stated, and it\u2019s a Eurocentric/Western viewpoint. It\u2019s saying nothing these other people accompanied counted unless the west acknowledge them. \n\nWhen the Scandinavian arrived on England we don\u2019t say they discovered England. The Romans didn\u2019t discover the Gaul, Germanic territories, regions to the west, or Egypt. China, Korea, the Dutch, America didn\u2019t discover feudal Japan. These countries recognize the other nations and cultures existed. We are correctly taught that these were meetings of different cultures. Then what happened after because of the culture clashes.\n\nHowever when it comes to the Americas or other lands of the area they were discovered.  There\u2019s no recognition that these were pre established nations or states. That they had governance, economies, nations, cultures, histories, and so forth. In the case of the Americas every nation was different, with vastly different histories. The situation is not framed like it really was. Colonies were occupations. Some friendly others not so much. It lead to wars, conquest, and genocide like many wars before it. The history was cleaned up to make the conqueror nations seem like they weren\u2019t so bad.\n\nI\u2019m not saying we need to blame modern people for our ancestors actions. We all descend from questionable people. But I think the Eurocentric view of history that was started in the colonial area and persist to today is outdated. It props up undeserving people to hero status and ignores accomplishments of others. We are older and wiser and should look at history with a bigger lens. Saying Europeans discovered occupied areas isn\u2019t a question of semantics, it\u2019s just factually false.",

No one says \"Columbus was the first European to discover America\" (which also wouldn't technically be true), they say \"Columbus discovered America.\" Period. \n\nIf we're using the broader definition that some people seem to be suggesting, then that means every single person who's ever gone to America for the first time also discovered it. Otherwise, we're claiming that Columbus is the only \"real person\" to have discovered America, and all the ones before him didn't count. \n\nYou can't simultaneously say that discovery is a broad term, and also that it only applies to Columbus. Either he discovered America, and so did everyone else, or he didn't discover it. Either way, he's nothing special.",

My only point was let's just switch them out for chronological sake.\n\nOr move indigenous peoples day.

He's not celebrated because his knowledge of the American continent didn't do anything. \n\nIf Leif Erickson had never gone to America, history wouldn't change much, if at all. If Columbus doesn't discover America, and, say, the British do a hundred years later, the entire world is a different place than it is today, probably worse for it, as the lessons and philosophies learned from atrocities committed by the Spanish in the 16th century don't happen. It completely alters the trajectory of the world. Does the 7 Years War still happen? Does the French and Indian theater happen? Without the French and Indian War, the American Revolution doesn't happen. Without the American Revolution, the French Revolution doesn't happen. Without the French Revolution, Napoleon doesn't happen. Napoleon certainly doesn't sell Louisiana, which the French likely wouldn't own, to the British to fund his wars against foes including the British. Meaning France never falls behind industrially, which means the relative calm of the 19th century doesn't happen, which means more aggressive and violent military campaigns during the African colonization in the 19th century, and more general European wars throughout that century, which means WW1 probably doesn't happen because the Germans never defeat the French in the Franco-Prussian War, which means no WW2, so America never expands from coast to coast, or it does under different circumstances and remains an English colony state, and never becomes a super power, so the Cold War doesn't happen. The negative view many people around the world held of Jews doesn't change because the Holocaust doesn't happen, Israel is never created, Europe just carves up the Middle East through colonization and holds it as such through the 20th century, 9/11 doesn't happen, and we pretty much hit today. \n\n\nWe can learn about our history and how it shaped our societies and cultures today, and take those lessons and strive to be better going forward. Or we can have arguments about the definition of the word discover and pretend to be woke because we judge Columbus based on modern ethical and moral standards.",

The ones that would exist in that timeline would be very different than the ones that existed in 1492, because they\u2019d still have gone through the plagues, so you could take lots of artistic license, but it\u2019d still involve taking tid bits of their cultures and building something different off of it, which would feel exploitative coming from somebody who isn\u2019t from those cultures and who would probably get lots of those things wrong. \n\nThe mystery of what was lost to world heritage is one of the two big draws of that story, and I don\u2019t know how you could depict that in a satisfying way. The other draw is the lost potential for a more just world, and I also don\u2019t know how to convey that as an engaging story.

At least 400 farms have been identified by archaeologists.\n\nIn 1126, the population requested a bishop (headquartered at Gar\u00f0ar), and in 1261, they accepted the overlordship of the Norwegian king. \n\nNorse Greenland had a bishopric (at Gar\u00f0ar) and exported walrus ivory, furs, rope, sheep, whale and seal blubber, live animals such as polar bears, supposed \"unicorn horns\" (in reality narwhal tusks), and cattle hides.\n\nThey continued to have their own law and became almost completely politically independent after 1349, the time of the Black Death.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe settlements began to decline in the 14th century. The Western Settlement was abandoned around 1350, and the last bishop at Gar\u00f0ar died in 1377.\n\nAfter a marriage was recorded in 1408, no written records mention the settlers. It is probable that the Eastern Settlement was defunct by the late 15th century. The most recent radiocarbon date found in Norse settlements as of 2002 was 1430 (\u00b115 years).\n\nSeveral theories have been advanced to explain the decline.\"\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse\\_colonization\\_of\\_North\\_America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_colonization_of_North_America)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo we don\u00b4t know exactly what happened but the Black Death was definetly a factor why we lost contact with them and probably why the settlements began to decline",

There's a pretty intuitive logic to first in time, first in right.\n\nThe Supreme Court used the [discovery doctrine in 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Sherrill_v._Oneida_Indian_Nation_of_New_York) to explain why Native Americans couldn't regain their sovereignty even after they bought all their land back.\n\nAnd it's important to note that we're 200+ years post independence. We're 500+ years post Columbus. \n\nAnd we're still invoking discovery as a justification for sovereignty and property rights. \n\nIf an entire *planet* were discovered, you better believe people would invoke the doctrine of discovery to support their claims to conquer, subjugate and plunder.

It just feels like at some point some solutions are \"too late\" to implement, and something of similar value has to be offered instead. Much like someone can't return the stolen candy they've eaten. \n\nI think there is an argument to be made that using the word makes it easier for people to continue using the discovery doctrine because the word \"discovery\" was used in some context.

Take the \"discovery\" of technetium. Scientists knew exactly what they were looking for. They knew just what to expect, which is how they were able to isolate the element they wanted. We credit them with 'discovering' technetium, but they had prior expectations.\n\nWhy the more restrictive meaning for discovering a place?\n\nOr take the 'discovery' of the source of the Nile. The explorers knew, again, exactly what they were looking for. They knew what to expect -- they were looking for a lake that would lead into the Nile river. And they found it! So why then do we say that they [\"discovered\" the source of the Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile#European_search_for_the_source_of_the_Nile) when it runs afoul of your definition, which is to find something with zero prior expectations?",

His discovery of Europe may have been significant for a relatively small number of people in Mongolia.

The simple truth of the matter is that while there's a very slight possibility that at this point people were capable of lashing together rudimentary rafts for short water jaunts (still highly doubtful) it is absolutely impossible that any real ocean going vessel was built prior to the Bronze Age. It's far more likely that was a land based migration using the proposed Bering Sea land-bridge.  \n\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-science-travel-fossils-new-mexico-97cb4b2ea0f499d6ea5fbfebab243413](https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-science-travel-fossils-new-mexico-97cb4b2ea0f499d6ea5fbfebab243413)  \n\n\n[https://www.npr.org/2021/09/24/1040381802/ancient-footprints-new-mexico-white-sands-humans](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/24/1040381802/ancient-footprints-new-mexico-white-sands-humans)  \n\n\n Now, as for your comments about the Vikings, the thing about the first Norse seafarers that made it to the Americas is that they were (originally) blown off course while traveling to colonies in Greenland. Without those colonies to travel to for trading expeditions/colonization efforts there's an infinitesimally small chance that any Norse sailor would have been blown that far west in the first place, and if they were, without ports to resupply in on the coasts of Greenland and Iceland there's simply no way the Norse sailors could have carried enough supplies for their trip to and back from the Eastern Seaboard. And again this is all assuming that 6/7th century Norse vessels would have been stout enough to withstand the full might of Atlantic storms without stopping in colonies to hunker down and seek shelter (not to mention that up until the 8th century, most if not all Viking ocean-going vessels did not make use of sails, meaning this entire journey would have had to have been conducted on oars alone.) There's always a possibility in cases like these, but frankly the odds and data are just so stacked against it, it's near impossible to be true",

The leaders of Judism believed Jesus to be a blasphemer, and caught him preaching on a Sunday, which is the day of Sabbath as God rested on a Sunday, and asked the Romans to execute him.",

That's probably because his original intention in undertaking the voyage was to disprove the then generally held (and now proven correct) view that the Earth is spherical. He thought it was pear shaped, which would have meant the top of the Earth was smaller in circumference than his contemporaries had calculated. That's why he thought he could reach India. Everyone else thought it was too far. And they were right, they just didn't think there would be another land mass in between.\n\nSo conceding he did not reach the East Indies would have meant conceding he was wrong about the shape of the Earth the whole time.",

When he appealed to the crown for help, they instead appointed someone to investigate, which led to his arrest and being sent back to Spain in chains.\n\nWhen he was eventually acquitted by the crown due to his brothers' pleas and was able to convince them to let him return, they still wouldn't return his governorship.  And on his last voyage, he ended up stranded on Jamaica and the governor of Hispaniola actively worked to obstruct any attempts to rescue Columbus because he despised him so much.\n\nChristopher Columbus was a reprehensible person by any measure.  And that's not even getting into how fucking stupid he was for doubting Eratosthenes' measurement of the circumference of Earth which was commonly accepted at the time, and just how much he lucked out that there was land between Europe and Asia.",

Francisco de Bobadilla, the man that replaced him, oversaw a much more peaceful time, and that was because he wasn't doing things like cutting off people's limbs, selling the Spanish into slavery, making children sex slaves, whipping people 100 times, putting nails through their hands, etc.\n\n\"It was a different time\" is just a lame attempt to excuse the actions of a brutal tyrant because he's been canonized into American mythology.",

And he was put on trial and stripped of his authority for the things Bobadilla uncovered.  His treatment of the Spaniards, in particular, was pretty outstanding for the day.  Some historians even cite his treatment of people and use of bodily harm as *beyond* what was done during the Spanish Inquisition.\n\nYes, part of it was also that Columbus was also incompetent, but his leadership and the fact that the island was in near revolt over his practices were absolutely part of that.  To say they otherwise, is to show ignorance of a pretty widely documented fact.",

But that does not appear to be a popular division.\n\nPhilippines are, geographically speaking, absolutely a part of Asia.

It's also possible to discover a great restaurant, someone else's secret, a great movie, or a million other things. Whence does this idea that a thing can only be discovered once originate?\n\nAs for the rest of it... nothing about discovery implies ownership. We attribute Newton with the discovery of gravity but that doesn't mean he owns a fundamental law of physics. You're upset about the part where Columbus killed a bunch of people, but that's just what happened after he discovered they existed. It's hard to exploit resources you're unaware of and no colonial empire ever needed the justification that \"discovery=ownership\" to decide they wanted something that someone else already had.",

What we shouldn't do is try to judge historical figures or societies based on today's standards. It's extremely stupid to do so, and at its very best hinders our ability to learn from it. \n\nThose morals and ethics you're espousing now are direct result of lessons learned and philosophical questioning that never would have happened without the atrocities of our predecessors. All we can do is to strive to be better going forward. We can only imagine what kind of things we just accept, and even happily engage in without second thought, that our descendants will find absolutely abhorrent.\n\nImagine if we did the same thing with other knowledge we have today versus the knowledge of the time. We'd have idiots calling Alexander a horrible military tactician because today we'd just mow his phalanxes down with machine gun nests. Or the Romans stupid for their proclivities towards building a fortress around their military camps because today it'd just give our Apache helicopters a target. Or denigrate the political wrangling of dynastic families like the Habsburgs, because using tactical marriages between closely related family members is genetically stupid, even as it allowed them to take control of the Holy Roman Empire for three centuries.\n\nIt's great that we recognize that what was done was horrible. It's bad to try and denigrate what was done back then under today's ideals and understanding. If it wasn't Columbus, it would have been some other explorer doing similar to the indigenous people. Just instead of Conquistadors we'd call the Conqu\u00e8rants or Conquerers.",

Northern Europeans knew of it the same way the Greeks 'knew' of Atlantis and Mu, or the Britons 'knew' of Avalon - they heard stories, and those stories were local legend that may or may not have been true.  But maybe you don't understand how disconnected and backwater Northern Europe, Iceland, and Greenland were at the time of Erikson's voyage, or that tales of long ago from your local elder or a random longshoreman aren't the same as a guy who personally set foot on previously unknown land and came back to tell a powerful royal court about it.\n\nColumbus was a dumbass and a dirtbag, but he did discover the Americas, and that's just not debatable.  He wasn't the first, not even the first for Europe or the Old World, but independent discoveries happen all the time.  He gets credit because the Norse fucked off and forgot about it where Columbus informed the Crowns of Castile and Aragon and established permanent contact.\n\nWhile we're on the topic, get off your high horse for Erikson.  He called the natives wretches, and judging on history and how the Norse treated foreign cultures, permanent contact with the Norse wouldn't have been much better.",

If the reporter had come to this knowledge independent of the scientist than he would that would have been a discovery on his part.  Columbus didn't know about the Americas prior to his departure from Europe, ergo he discovered the Americas.  Nobody's (rightfully) claiming that he was the first to do so as if he was a maritime Niel Armstrong, but he is credited by and large to exposing the continents to Western Europe and much of the world powers at the time.",

Madame Curie is known as the person who discovered many fascinating aspects of radioactivity because she observed, recorded, and documented them in a coherent manner. The fact that she wasn't the first person to observe or experience them doesn't take away from her work. \n\nThe prehistoric people who first came to North America weren't explorers trying to find a new place - they were accidental migrants who ended up here as a result of millenia of survival stresses. They didn't write anything down because they couldn't. They didn't have a system of writing, and they hadn't yet developed the concept of a written or historical record.\n\nFrom the perspective of 15th century Europeans, finding North America and its peoples was an act of discovery.  Nobody's asserting that other peyote didn't get here first. \n\nThe original migrants to North America also weren't the same people that were encountered when Europeans finally arrived.  In fact,  it's likely that the indigenous people that were here by the time Europeans arrived wiped out the original 'Americans'. \n\nCall them 'First Peoples' or 'Natives', or whatever you like - the folks who were inhabiting North America when Europeans arrived were average human beings. War, cruelty, and even genocide was part of their history and legacy.  'Native Americans'  have no more moral high ground to claim ownership of North America than anyone else.",

It's our nationality without question, but ethnicity is from wherever your ancestors originally came from as a nation of immigrants and Native Americans. It's not an unusual question to ask about someone's ethnic background in certain settings/situations to make conversation. since it's understood that unless you're a an American Indian you have ancestors are from somewhere else.  \"American\" is not an ethnicity. Maybe in the future when enough generations are under the country's belt the cultural perception will change.\n\nEdit: White and Black are blanket terms to refer to two either European or African ancestry, but those are more seen as \"race\" or general ethnicity. If someone is able to identify their more precise ethnic origins, then they could say that they're part German or mostly West African (as examples) while being white or black, respectively.",

The issue at hand here isn't the existence of a thing, it's the discovery of a thing (a continent in this case) by humans.

And we were so successful that today you can write statements like \u201cAmerican culture is European\u201d and you are largely  correct in the popular sense.\n\nThe reason we want to stop honoring people like Columbus is because we recognize how horrifically racist and genocidal our ancestors were.

The public school curriculum needs to be updated so that those lessons are required, and not up to the discretion of the teacher. The article I shared was only meant to show that in my state, the idea of indigenous stories and perspectives is only now gaining recognition. I do see why you said it doesn\u2019t prove/disprove teaching about the genocide, and I should\u2019ve clarified when I shared it that we are still only teaching one side of the story here.",

The primary goal of Columbus' later voyages was to begin establishing permanent colonies (which he personally oversaw and profited from). He wasn't just the guy who found the Americas, he had a direct role in determining the methods by which Colonialism would occur. The brutal nature of Spanish conquests and the utilization of the encomienda system in the Americas can be directly tied to methods of colonization he established.\n\nThere's a very real possibility that if a less psychopathic man had been in his place, the history of European colonization would look very different.",

Why are you making that up?\n\nBecause every year this month, I keep hearing the same circlejerk arguments that \"Columbus didn't discover America!\", \"Native Americans were here first!, \"Leif Erikson did it first!\" etc, and it gets kind of annoying.  I get those arguments, but lets be honest, none of those things really amounted to anything in terms of changing the course of history throughout the globe, Columbus's \"discovery\" did.  Yes he was genocidal monster in a long list of notable genocidal monsters throughout history but it just seems disingenuous when people claim Columbus discovery of America wasn't really much in terms of being a historically significant event therefore we should never mention his name anymore as if he's Voldemort or something.",

According to the saga they tried settling down and started to trade with the local indian population, at first with clothes. The indians wanted weapons which the nordic settlers did not want to trade. And so they started fighting and killing eachother. After 3 years the nordic settlers decided that they couldn\u2019t coexist with the indians and so they returned east.",

      "text": "Technically Columbus didn\u2019t discover America. There were people already here. Besides the first foreigners that arrived were Vikings. What Columbus was trying to do was find a way to India for trade because the path through the Mediterranean was blocked by the Arabs. Spain at the time was world power but deeply in debt. Europeans thought the world was flat. And that Columbus was going to fall off the edge of the world. Columbus stumbled upon America. So instead of finding a way around the Arabs, he found a land very rich in food, gold, silver, salt, emeralds, etc. so that\u2019s what they exploited. Taking advantage of the native South Americans, enslaving them, murdering them, and submitting them to believe in a god they did not need. Let\u2019s remember that Columbus first arrived to the Caribbean islands, then they worked their way south and found South America. Colombia to be exact. The first 2 cities ever founded on continental land were Santa Marta and Cartagena, both Colombian cities. Cartagena is one huge fortress built for defense against the Dutch, French, Portuguese and especially pirates. Later they made their way to the west and found Mexico. Once the rest of Europe found out that there was land on the other side of the ocean, Portugal, The Netherlands, England, France all joined in on the conquest and colonization of the americas. Something similar to the gold rush in California. Due to the many battles, on the bottom of the Caribbean Sea lie many sunken French, Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish and pirate ships supposedly full of golden treasures stolen from the natives. In my most humble opinion, Columbus is the fall guy. He had the balls to see if there was an edge of the world to fall off of. He was one of the first to propose the world was round. He believed it vehemently. What he didn\u2019t know was the existence of the American continents. Queen Isabel of Spain was so in debt, she gambled the voyage. She gave him 3 crappie ships, La Pinta, La Ni\u00f1a and La Santa Maria full of thieves and convicts because everyone else was afraid and convinced Columbus was heading straight to his death. That\u2019s why many European museums have the most beautiful golden artifacts and pieces that originally came from South America. That\u2019s what queen Isabel used to pay her debts. Then came the legend of El Dorado. A Colombian city made of gold. What they saw was Guatavita. A small indigenous settlement on a lake with the same name where the natives would worship their gods. They witnessed a man, the chief, so to speak, literally covered in gold and the natives throwing the most elaborate golden offerings to the bottom of the lake. But there was no golden city. Still convinced there was a gold city, the conquistadors made their way to Peru and encountered the Incas. There. Columbus is just the fall guy. He just wanted to find a way around the Arabs. It never crossed his mind to conquer anything anywhere. It was those who followed that everyone today should be pissed off at.",

You had to be in the know back then otberwise you were taught the earth is flat and the center of the solar system. The understanding and mapping accuracy of some other ancient civilizations makes it also hard to believe they had no idea America existed. They knew the earth was round and wanted to map it out.

Sure the natives migrated here over an ice bridge from Asia but there was no \"discovery\" it was simply a nomadic tribe likely following herds that they used for food. To them they were none the wiser they had entered an entirely different side of the world and the generations of natives after them had no idea they were on a separate continent . Similar to Europeans, they thought where they were was the whole world. You can't really apply out modern understanding of the continents to people who had no concept of what a continent really was.",

Virtually no Europeans of the time did. He was the first European to land in Americas, but it didn't affect anyone back in Europe. No expeditions were sent out, no missions, no scholars documented the discovery. Once Vinland fell, it was forgotten. You can discover something for the first time twice.

No economic or technological advancement is worth the genocide and oppression of an entire continent. Just because your culture benefited from it doesn't make it worthy of celebration, no matter the historical relevance. That's the bias I think you're overlooking.\n\n>The discovery of the Americas by the indigenous people was valuable to those who discovered it but had minimal to no impact on the future of the world.\n\nYou're basically doubling down here. Have you thought about the impact on the future of the world the colonisation of America had from the perspective of the indigenous people? It's not just the genocide and oppression during those times. It resulted in centuries of systemic inequality, discrimination and abuse that still prevails today.\n\nIf you want to make it a date to remember so bad, make it a memorial day to remember the countless lives sacrificed in the name of unchecked greed and hunger for power.",

If he had accepted he did not find India and did in fact find a new world he would lose all titles to said land and his family would also. Until his death he said he found India. Now weather you are in the class of people that believe the high middle age explores were so dull to think everything to the west was called one place or that Marco Polo was the only Christian person to ever explore that realm I would relate to you the vast knowledge that Europeans have had on India since Alexander The greats time. Their had been many Christians in the west, the Mongol empire, and in the dynasty\u2019s that followed, the Golden Horde in modern day baltics and Russia, the Ilkhanate in modern day Middle East, and the empire proper in China. Let us not forget that the Franco-Mongol alliance that allowed the legend of Prestor John to flourish. This idea that Europe had no idea what was west is false. The crusades, the Barbary pirates, and the Silk Road allowed information to flow from the the far and mysterious lands of Japan all the way up to Scandinavia. I would also like to blow your mind and explain that ancient Chinese had a flourishing trade with ancient native Americans, there has been found in records and actually artifacts from the americas in ancient Chinese capitals. But I digress, I believe that Columbus knew exactly what he found but due to contracts and politics of his day he could not admit it. His sons did openly when they were secure in their government positions but Columbus never could or he would lose said positions.",

But to use that logic why did they call the land they discovered the indes and not cipagu if they did in-fact not believe they were in the islands off of India. Furthermore how could they determine the difference between east and west if by using your logic they thought they were the same land mass. I do believe you are aware that, that terminology did not come along well after Columbus. And no Columbus did not admit to finding new lands. Once again using your logic if he was to find Japan rather than new lands he would be secure in his 10% profits and titles as would be his descendants but admiring to finding new lands and not a route to the indes would void his contract. He was imprisoned after his third journey for not bringing back enough profits. I would also it was not the Persians causing problems for trade it was the re-conquesta of the Iberian Peninsula. You can\u2019t really have good trade relations with a culture and people you just conquered and kicked out of the land. I have been looking for some links on the Americans and China trade but the best I can find on the internet is some lithograph in the Americas. I heard a story on the subject in 2021 on NPR it was really amazing I will keep looking for it.",

He did not even bring enough provisions for the journey and the Portuguese Jews in counsel of the court of queen Isabella knew it. They could tell by measuring the circumference of the earth. There is this entire theory that the reason queen Isabella accepted the job was after convincing from her financial manager, a recent conversio that it was profitable. that he had underlying interests. He a former Jew wanted a safe land for his people to live because of knowledge of the coming inquisition. There is an amazing story of the founding of Jamaica. On his, I believe third journey he and a small galley crashed on the island. Him his son and about a dozen men split on the beach. About 6 hardened sailor split and went their own way. At their camp on the far side of the beach they were attacked by Columbus son and and about 6 Jewish youths. They took the men into custody and some of the youths stayed. That is the story of the founding of Jamaica. I believe I have vast knowledge in this matter. I listen to allot of historical podcasts and read many books. If you are interested I can give you some of the podcasts and books I gained my knowledge from.",

Now obviously in cases like the US civil war? Yeah fuck the slavers, they had ample time and opposing arguments, but during the 1400s that wasn't the case. Stop throwing fascism around like a buzzword when you clearly have no idea what it is",

To say so is to say every civilization that has had slaves in the past was fascist, which isn't true.

Enslaving people is neglecting of human rights, not fascism.",

Either you celebrate native genocide and everything else columbus is reaponsible for, or you dont.\n\n\n\nAlso columbus is not the only human who could have done that in perpetuity.

Ok...\n\nWhat's your point? How, in any way, does this have a discernable impact on you? What does it matter if the genocidal maniac (who has been a corpse for 600 years) that your were told discovered the land in which you reside on, didn't actually discover said land.  We know he didn't discover it because to be a genocidal maniac, there has to be someone to genocide.\n\nWhy let this ruin your day? Why do reactionaries respond with such vitriol to things that have no impact on them or anyone they care about?\n\nThe guy who posted doesn't give a fuck about it. He will go to absurdly expensive home, lay down in a bed that costs more that your car, and pass..the fuck...out, only to wake up the next day and find another manufactured reason for you to hate someone.\n\nThey have to keep your discontent aimed at something, because if they allow you enough time to lift you head from looking down on someone different, then you might just realize the real target deserving of your anger.  It's them. They hate you. They don't care if you live or die, they only care that you aren't their opposition. You don't need that in your life. You don't  need them in your life.\n\nThey NEED you.",

Oh, and theres a bunch of people (especially americans) who say italians aren't white, so don't lump Columbus with the evil white colonizers, since he was a POC.\n\n In a similar way, some east asians  crossing the Bering strait thousands of years ago  didn't really discover much. They literally just walked into America like you would walk into a supermarket. People back then didn't have maps or anything, what the hell were they going to discover?  Even then, by Columbus' times, whoever discovered it was dead thousands of years ago and nobody will ever know who it was, so why wasn't Columbus going to get the credit. He was the one crazy enough to try to cross the Atlantic ocean when nobody was known to have ever tried (or succeded) before, and he made an empire out of it.

And will probably stay that way even if we ever find the camera with any proof of them reaching it. Cause a big part of an expedition is coming back alive.",

But second, even if we change the meaning to \"European to discover\", then we know a certain Norse by the name of Leif Erikson arrived 500 years earlier. Heck, he even settled Greenland (which is undeniably part of America), and most probably even mainland North America (which admittedly is something not fully proved, albeit extremely likely).\n\nHeck, I'm Spaniard, we funded Columbus, he made his discoveries in our name, and I don't get offended when people say that he wasn't the first, because he wasn't. He was just a guy and nobody should build their national identity on worshipping a guy.",

I guess he does embody the American value of going to other people's countries, killing them, and unapologetically wrecking/taking their stuff, so...\n\n*Not actually, I know how it happened, but it's still kind of nonsensical. Like, of this is the best \"hero\" you can come up with, maybe just stay quiet.",

I was in middle school when I first heard about the stone viking style houses in nova Scotia. I hate the whole tone of all this propaganda, like Columbus committed genocide against Indian with small pox blankets. Germ warfare hundreds of years before we knew about germs hahaha. If u had tried to explained to Columbus what a germ is and how it works u would have been burned at the stake for witch craft. Wtf?",

They aren't actually celebrating first contact between European and Indigenous American civilizations, but the genocide and destruction of the one. They're trying to hush Lief Erikson's accomplishments because he didn't succeed in mass slaughter.",

For all intents and purposes, yes, Columbus discovered America. That is a true statement, fully justified, and what should be taught.\n\nIf you weren't going to credit Columbus, you would credit explorers *after* him, not before, because it was explorers like Cortez, Ponce de Leon, Cabeza, Vasquez, Cabot, etc. were the ones who made seriously inroads into the continent and interacted with the dominant political powers there. Nordic explorers made fledgling, temporary settlements in  'Marckland' (North-East Canada), barely reported them, barely spoke of them, and never returned. The only real problem with the claim that Columbus discovered America is that he actually only discovered a string of Caribbean islands and never realized that he had encountered an entirely separate continent, nor did he ever set eye or step foot on that continent.\n\nRegarding the whole Italian-American thing... that's to do with how Italian-Americans needed to justify their immigration to the States in the late 19th century, so they trumpeted previous famous Italians and tried to link them to the foundation of the USA, even though with Columbus that link is  anemically weak.",
