They all look alike. A bunch of people desperately trying to show that they are doing stuff just to get validation. There is the self and the idea of it. As we get absorbed in our desire for social validation, the line between this idea of ourselves and actual self disintegrates. We lose connection with our inner desires, we become what people want us to be. Our actions start to lose their meaning and all that is left is a shell of what we truly are.",
