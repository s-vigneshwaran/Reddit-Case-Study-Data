For instance, the largest English-speaking city in the world is Lagos, Nigeria and more people speak English in India than in England.\n\nAnother interesting counter point is Russia where the nobility learned French and in many cases couldn\u2019t or could barely speak Russian.\n\nClearly it doesn\u2019t happen always as the examples in this thread point out but simply saying \u201cin most cases\u201d to me isn\u2019t very satisfactory. It could be an interesting paper to examine the variables that effect this; trade, technological differences, religion and migrations are all factors that come to mind that would probably be relevant.",

But they were wrong.\n\nStopping a child from using their left hand so that they don't look weird compared to the other children does nothing. It wasn't to make them more successful. It was just 'weird'-- so they were hit if they wrote with the wrong hand.\n\nYes, those kids lost their language, and that's horrible and sad, I'm sure they experienced shame about their native tongue. But I bet their school outcomes improved. That's wrong, but not evil\n\nBut left handed children were also made to feel shame, gained no benefits from writing with their left hand, were abused. That's evil (and wrong..)\n\nIf I'm learning about these two things-- the first is going to make me go \"huh, what am I doing now that has benefits but might actually be harmful in the long run?\" whereas the other one makes me go \"wow what evil assholes-- I'm glad I'm not an evil asshole like that guy\"",

Unless of course their english skills were rudamentary at best and there were absolutely no resources for someone who spoke their native language.\n\nThat said, I was working off the context of the discussion, not empirical evidence. And in the context of the discussion, the teachers have evidence that welsh speakers were being outperformed by English speakers.\n\nI was talking about language using the example at hand, not making an argument that the people who used corporal punishment to commit cultural genocide were good people.\n\nThe outcome is evil in any case-- the lesson of the outcome being evil is that cultural genocide is bad. But if we're teaching about how to prevent something like cultural genocide-- or other evil outcomes-- teaching that evil people did evil things isn't particularly helpful. People will say \"I'm not evil and I would never do an evil thing\" and \"know\" that those actions don't apply to them. they already \"know\" they would never do anything evil.\n\n If we want to prevent future evil outcomes by learning from the past-- we should be talking about how good people, with good intentions, end up doing the wrong thing, and cause evil outcomes. \n\nOn the *assumption* that --whoever above said it--they had evidence that showed that welsh speakers were being outperformed by english speakers, or even that they otherwise believed that they were doing a good thing by making welsh students speak english for whatever reason, then they are good people, trying to do good things, and being wrong about it. The lesson in that is --in short-- \"the road to hell is paved in good intentions\". People will say \"oh, I try to do the right thing, is this actually a good thing that I'm doing to help someone?\" and possibly examine their actions.\n\nI have no idea if there was any evidence to support that teachers thought they were improving academic success.

Words are fluid, their meaning changes based on context. It's not even a little bit weird to suggest that evil can refer to both or either intent or execution, depending on the context. It's unfortunate that we each approached the term here with a different context that led us each to understand the word in slightly different ways, but we dealt with it by clarifying what was meant. \n\nNow it's time to move on. It's not only completely incorrect to pretend that there's even a correct answer to the question of \"who is right about what evil means?\" (because the answer is \"both of us\" because that's how language works - words have multiple meanings and implications), but it's also kind of a waste of time. Who cares? You know what the original comment was trying to say now, so engage with that given that new clarity. It's pointless to get into a pedantic argument about what definition of \"evil\" you personally prefer.",

And it is true throughout history. Denying it is just reductionist. \n\nThe British would have had absolutely zero chance to rule India to the extent and for the length of time we did with out support from within India. Whether they are rulers we put in place or not, without them at best the British would have controlled a small region.\n\nThe Nazis wouldn't have been able to capture and slaughter anywhere near as many of the \"undesirables\" without support from locals who supported their veiws. This is not to say that many who informed were not coerced, but equally not all who informed were coerced.\n\nThe slave trade would not have been as strong without local rulers and war lords gathering people to sell to the European slave traders.\n\nThe Roman conquest of Britain would have failed without support of tribes that feared the Catuvellauni.\n\nThese are but a few examples. And before you get all worked up, pay attention to this. These facts do not undercut or subvert the responsibility the British, Nazis, Slave traders, Romans etc have for their actions. But history is not as clean and neat as people in modern times like to admit, so like it or not, it's what happened, there are shades of grey everywhere.\n\n> I don't actually\n\nMy apologies, I assumed you were British.",

Idk if it's actually the native language of any of them anymore, because if they want to do any business outside of their very small nation, Scots will also need to know English. But there is literally still an entire TV Station which is Scottish Gaelic only. You can go watch NEW Scottish Gaelic TV online right now.\n\n\"Irish Gaelic\" is actually just known as \"Irish\" in Ireland, and is the native language of 138,000+ people, and the second language of over a million in Ireland ALONE.\n\nI know a couple people living in the USA who speak Irish, and several people who speak Scottish Gaelic, including one of my best friends, and two of my direct family members.\n\nWhat part of any of that says \"dead language\" to you?!",

The Irish government only collects numbers and not levels of fluency .\n\nYou say a million+ but according to the census, of that million+, a third only speak it in education, similar to how you likely learn French or some other European language. 24% say they never speak it, that's apparantly people who can, but don't.\n\nThere are only 73,000 daily users outside of education, which is a drop compared to another study from 5 years earlier, so if you reference this study, you could argue that it is infact, a dying language. 1.7% of the population speak daily and estimates of fully native speakers range from 40,000 to 80,000 not 138,000+\n\nIn the same way the census says that 29% of people speak Welsh equating to 883,300, but again how many of these people can just say shit and piss.\n\nWhereas the Welsh government has an Annual Population Survey which is used to closely monitor the number of Welsh speakers in addition to Language Use Surveys asking a higher number of detailed questions in order to ascertain levels of fluency within the population.\n\nThe Annual Population Survey found that 11% or 311,700 people were fluent, and 85% of those used it daily. \n\nSo that's 264,945 daily Welsh speakers vs 60,000 and 73,000 Scottish and Irish respectively so yes Welsh never became anywhere as *near*  to being dead as Scottish and Irish.\n\nIt's not just about numbers, it's about fluency, it's about the language being alive in the community, it's about it being a part of the culture. Ireland and Scotland lost this, luckily Wales didn't.\n\n[The UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger of Disappearing](http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php) corroborates this by categorising Welsh as 'Vulnerable' and Scottish and Irish 'Definitely Endangered'.\n\n>I know a couple people living in the USA who speak Irish, and several people who speak Scottish Gaelic, including one of my best friends, and two of my direct family members.\n\nI know heaps of Irish people too, I also lived in Ireland for a year. I didn't meet anybody who spoke the language fluently, just odd words and phrases. Same goes for Scots Gaelic. My father lived in Scotland for years, I spent 2 summers there when I was younger. Again no fluent speakers to my knowledge, though one guy spoke Shetlandic, a dialect of Insular Scots.",

If people put HALF the effort into protecting Irish and Scottish Gaelic as they have Welsh, Gaelic would be a very strong language on both fronts.

Considering you're peddling this shit in numerous spots, I'll copy and paste my response here too.\n\n>What part of any of that says \"dead language\" to you?!\n\nI didn't say they are dead languages, I said \n>Luckily Welsh never became anywhere as near to being dead as Irish or Scottish Gaelic.\"\n\n\nThe numbers you speak of are hugely misleading.\n\n>is the native language of 138,000+ people and the second language of over a million in Ireland ALONE.\n\nThese numbers are from the census but the census question does not specify extent of usage, or ability level so it's hard to guage who can actually speak the language and who only knows how to ask their teacher if they can go to the toilet or a few swear words. The Irish government only collects numbers and not levels of fluency .\n\nYou say a million+ but according to the census, of that 1.7 million, a third only speak it in education, the same way you probably learn French. 24% say they never speak it, that's apparantly people who can, but don't.\n\nThere are only 73,000 daily users outside of education, which is a drop compared to another study from 5 years earlier, so if you reference this study, you could argue that it is infact, a dying language. 1.7% of the population speak daily and estimates of fully native speakers range from 40,000 to 80,000 not 138,000+\n\nIn the same way the census says that 29% of people speak Welsh equating to 883,300, but again how many of these people can just say shit and piss.\n\nWhereas the Welsh government has an Annual Population Survey which is used to closely monitor the number of Welsh speakers in addition to Language Use Surveys asking a higher number of detailed questions in order to ascertain levels of fluency within the population.\n\nThe Annual Population Survey found that 11% or 311,700 people were fluent, and 85% of those used it daily. \n\nSo that's 264,945 daily Welsh speakers vs 60,000 and 73,000 Scottish and Irish respectively so yes Welsh never became anywhere as *near*  to being dead as Scottish and Irish.\n\nIt's not just about numbers, it's about fluency, it's about the language being alive in the community, it's about it being a part of the culture. Ireland and Scotland lost this, luckily Wales didn't.\n\n[The UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger of Disappearing](http://www.unesco.org/languages-atlas/index.php) corroborates this by categorising Welsh as 'Vulnerable' and Scottish and Irish 'Definitely Endangered'.",

Big populations of folk in most of the major cities, but especially Augusta, Lewiston, Biddeford, Auburn.\n\nBut yes, they're ***forced*** to learn a language.

A lot of people hereabouts have lost their Welsh identity and don\u2019t think of welsh language as being integral to it.

But people that value that Welsh identity I think appreciate that sometimes you don\u2019t do something because it\u2019s more convenient, you do some things because they\u2019re right and this is one of those things. \n\nA lot of people here are completely ignorant of the Welsh specific history, folklore and culture. Which is just sad really but it makes sense when you compare it to Scotland who have managed to preserve a bit more of their identity due to the distance from the English cultural hub in the south and the mountains between. Wales has a pretty invisible border geographically and a relatively close proximity to London and southern English culture/the monarchy (historically speaking).\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that there are some Welsh speakers who are understandably frustrated and annoyed by this attitude, and so aren\u2019t always encouraging to people who don\u2019t speak the lingo or make an effort. This can put a lot of people off and make them feel \u201cjudged\u201d.",

They fear that their children will be left behind in school due to the fact, that multi-lingual children throw words from different languages into the same sentences before they realize that they are distinct languages. That problem usually corrects itself by the age of 4 or 5, though.\n\nI even know one mother who teaches her 4-year-old English with a terrible accent and grammatical errors in every single sentence instead of talking to her child in at least one of the three languages she's fluent in. I wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it myself.\n\nAnd local dialects are even more endangered because way too many see them as a sign of being uneducated instead of kinda sorta having half a foreign language (partially different words, grammar etc).",

I grew up only speaking Spanish until like 4 ish and then my brother who at the time was 6 had problems learning English so they decided it was best to just start speaking to us only in English and putting us in an English speaking pre-k. My Spanish now isn't too good I would say it's ok but Cubans expect you to speak perfect spanish it's very frustrating. I asked my dad why they thought it was a good idea at the time and he just told me how he was bullied and held back and pretty much put into the 'special' class because he didn't really know English too well when he was younger. My grandparents have been here since the 60s and they don't really speak English so he had to learn through school. I would say it's very very frustrating both that I don't speak Spanish and how rude everyone is when I don't speak Spanish fluently. Also there are people who when they move to another country to have a better life for their kids they kind of want to remove any association of where they came from and the only way to do that is to never teach their kids their language.",

Either because they deemed it unnecessary or because they saw it as pandering to immigrants or, *worst of all*, trying to \u201cturn America Mexican\u201d.\n\nThese are the same people who view colleges as institutes of indoctrination, and are scared by nothing more than the idea that (specifically Black and/or Brown) immigrants are coming to steal their jobs and replace \u201creal Americans\u201d. Their children learning Spanish (or any other language) is viewed as a ploy by \u201cthe left\u201d to make that easier. They believe ***all*** immigrants (even naturalized citizens) should be forced to completely assimilate, too, so in their minds, their child learning Spanish is completely unnecessary. (Obviously, they aren\u2019t taking the benefits of easier communication when traveling into mind, but most of the people I knew growing up who were like this had rarely left the *state* let alone the US.)\n\nNow obviously, most people (even in rural America) aren\u2019t like this, but they do exist, even as a loud minority. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s *extremely* common, just it\u2019s much more prevalent than you\u2019d think.\n\nAlso, u/CamGoatMan wrote:\n\n>*\u201dNever heard of anyone who DIDN\u2019T want their kids to be multilingual, with all the neurological benefits that it brings\u2026\u201d*\n\nI was replying to that, not the original discussion regarding Welsh specifically.",

No language is better or worse than any other in any way that can be meaningful. There are many, many worse ways to spend human endeavour than to encourage the growth of a dying language.",

I was really lucky with a gifted teacher, he was fluent in six or seven different languages and colloquially in another 8 or so. he graduated high school into the army language school and became a spy translating intercepted messages during ww2 I believe, or maybe Korea hahaha. was a really awesome old teddy bear of a man. :) probably one of the smartest men I'll ever meet.",

There's also the fact that Duolingo is pretty good at teaching you sentence structure - the weird things they ask you to translate get memed on, but it's better to understand \"Where is the \\[blank\\]\" than to memorize \"Whereisthebathroom\" as a phrase.

I am doing Japanese now and I'm not finding any additional relevant information when looking it up that I didn't learn either through the tips or from common sense while doing the lessons.\n\nDuolingo tends to prefer to teach you through implicit learning, which is probably where you're finding trouble.

To say that the law affects both equally is to *completely* ignore any externalities. \n\nThe real question is whether or not the presence of these language laws are necessary to preserve the language. And I think at worst the answer is *maybe*, given we know damn well that the anglophone is more than capable of wiping out languages, and given we know that English is the world's lingua franca. At the *very least*, I think it's safe to say that Quebeci fears of french erasure are substantiated.",

I pointed out that there's no need to negatively enforce the language when positive reinforcement works so much better. The idea that a culture is disappearing and needs defending is one of the foundational principles of fascism. Of course, I'm not saying Quebec is fascist. However, I feel like those policies make fascism easier to mask under the guise of defending the language and culture. I'm not worried about Quebec anglophones being oppressed. They aren't the only people that exist there. However, I do think it can be a difficult position to hold for a minority to maintain its equal footing in a nation as large as Canada without garnering some resentment. \n\nTake Israel, for instance: all polarized politics aside. If Israel were to ban Arabic, that would be considered hateful and racist and some might say cultural genocide. Despite the fact that Palestinians speak Arabic and Arabic has a massive 600 million strong native speaker population, making Hebrew with its measly 9 million by far the minority. So I'm failing to see why it's ok in Quebec. Also, I'm not saying it's racist or any of that I'm just attempting some kind  comparison. Don't rip it apart because the situations are obviously profoundly different. \n\n But I would like to thank all Canadians for not resorting to terrorism about the debate. Merci",

Is it illegal for a business to greet customers in any way other than in german first followed by another language? \n\nFurthermore, Germany only has one official language: German, no shit you have to know German to live there, a comparison would be like if there were a German province that had an 90% demographic speaking bloody Cantonese and they effectively banned any other language INCLUDING GERMAN. Fuck the 10% German speakers and everyone visiting from other German provinces, we speak Cantonese and that's it. Also, it's Illegal for anyone but native German speakers already living there to send their children to any school other than Cantonese immersion. Why? Fuck you, that's why. \n\nOf course you should learn the language if you want to live there, it would be stupid not to but in Quebec it's ILLEGAL not to- that's the controversy. 20% of Canadians speak French. Most of them are in Quebec. Going by Quebec's logic, since the vast majority of Canadians speak English, the official language of Canada is English and if you don't like it, don't live there. Sure Quebec can add French to the official language of the province but everywhere else is exclusively English. Now if you don't like it, live in Quebec. But no, the official language of Canada is... oh, wait there's two: English and French. That's weird. \n\nThe language and customs of Quebec is not French only, it's 90%  French, 10% English. Both languages are present along with a whole host of other languages brought to Quebec by immigration but we all know how Quebec feels about immigrants. I'm not asking why the signs are in French, I'm not asking why I'm greeted in French, it's 90%, that's obvious. I'm not even asking why the official language of Quebec is only French as 10<20, all these things make sense. After all, the official language of Ontario is English with only 4.7% of the province being francophone yet they STILL have bilingual signage in french-dominated areas like Hawkesbury with same size font. \n\nI'm asking why it's ILLEGAL to have signs in English, why it's ILLEGAL to be greeted in English. It's the LAWS that are stupid and discriminatory, I love the fact that I get service in French, it means that the culture is alive, especially somewhere where the demographic is 1.3% anglo like Quebec city but when I go somewhere like the West Island in Montreal where the demographic is 42% English, 31% French and 27% other and I still get service in EXCLUSIVELY, that's a problem. After all, \"if you to live in a region(,) you talk their language.\" They could be doing it because perhaps even in the west island, 100% of business owners and employees are francophone- that's technically possible but not the case. I'm greeted by Anglophones speaking French with French signage in an area that's majority Anglophone. Still not a problem, they have the freedom to do that. The problem is that they don't have the freedom to do anything else and you won't find that in Germany. \n\nVaccines have nothing to do with language, absolutely. Human rights regarding vaccines have everything to do with human rights regarding language; human rights are human rights. Just like discrimination against people of colour and antisemitism have everything to do with each other, in fact, they're both types of racism, Whoopi Goldberg.",

If you need to use the notwithstanding clause to opt out of the Charter of human rights, you're violating human rights and you're wrong. PERIOD. Eliminate everything? The entire government?

Both became vulnerable after the\u00a0Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms\u00a0took effect in 1982. Soon afterwards the\u00a0Supreme Court of Canada\u00a0ruled that \u2018Bill 101\u2019 must be brought into conformity with section 23(1)(b) of the Charter, which guarantees Canadian citizens who received an English education in Canada the right to educate their children in English (see\u00a0Quebec (A.G.)\u00a0v.\u00a0Quebec Protestant School Boards, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 66). In 1988 the provision relating to signs was struck down as a violation of freedom of expression (see\u00a0Ford\u00a0v.\u00a0Quebec A.G., [1988] 2 S.C.R. 712), but the Bourassa government promptly used the notwithstanding clause to re-enact it in a modified form, a measure that caused three anglophone cabinet ministers to resign. In 1993 a further modification allowed English to appear on signs posted outdoors provided the French words were more prominent.\" \n\n- constitutionalstudies.ca \n\nBasically the Bourassa government opted out of that section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to pass Bill 101.\n\nThis is literally done to control the population of Quebec into speaking French. \n\nThis is literally oppression by definition",

Here in Spain we have Castilian as the main official language, but some regions have a second official language, the only ones officially approved being Galician (my own), Basque and Catalan.\n\nThose regions have had a history of nationalism and independentism, some of them for centuries, so many Spaniards see the language difference as something that divides the nation rather than enriching its culture.\n\nAs such, those languages have been viciously attacked through history, most recently during Franco's dictatorship, who forbade them.\n\nNowadays those languages are, as I said, considered coofficial, and have survived and thrived in their local regions, some better than others (Catalan is widely spoken in Catalu\u00f1a, while Galician is mainly spoken in the most rural areas of Galicia, and just a few of the towns and cities), but we still have movements stating that learning any of those languages is a waste of time, and that it endangers the survivability of Castilian in those particular areas, which is absurd.\n\nWelsh people, fight for the survival of your language, and your right to speak it.",

We just want to exist, the way we are, without oppression, with freedom of expression, and culture. It\u2019s too long to explain in a reddit post, but to have an English person state that we need to respect each other more - whilst good-natured and correct - is like a kick in the face to Welsh people (and other Celtic nationals). We haven\u2019t oppressed and attempted cultural decimation, we haven\u2019t - unknowingly - been arrogant, and ignorant to the English, whilst we are constantly barraged with micro-aggressions, structural attacks, abused as a nation and as a people. It\u2019s a big conversation. Living as a Welsh person, currently going through gentrification (it\u2019s a big thing the English media love to spin).\n\nThere\u2019s too much to talk about here, but if the English government taught their history correctly - about insular UK activities - then Welsh people would have an easier time. The English are arrogant out of ignorance, and lack of education (in this instance, re: Welsh-English relations). I got told to \u2018speak English\u2019 when I attempted a conversation with a foreigner (assuming tourist), when I initiated a conversation in Welsh (it\u2019s like you using English, instead of Japanese in a small English village), and that\u2019s off the top of my head right now, there\u2019s many more.\n\nIn a generalised sense, you\u2019re obviously 100% correct. In this instance, under this topic (shown by the picture), the onus shouldn\u2019t be on the Celtic Nations, it should be on the English.\n\nLove reading your opinion though, it\u2019s very refreshing to see.

Though yes, people will be quick to bring up the Welsh Not, this was not as widely used as many have been led to believe. England, and by extension, the British state *does have a long and tested history of oppression of culture and language* but I'd make the compelling argument that the Welsh language was not one of them.\n\nWelsh survived for such a long time, unlike Irish, due to the fact the Welsh didn't really rebel all that much after it was conquered. It just didn't make any sense for the English at the time to invest resources in destroying Welsh culture, because well.. it was never really ever a threat once the rebellion of Owain Glyndwr was put down.\n\nWelsh started its decline around the 18th-19th century due to middle class and affluent Welsh folk seeing that *not* teaching their sons and daughters English was a huge disadvantage and the language saw a relatively natural fall of. You can check the graphs on this.. Welsh almost completely died out by the 1920s. Around this time, Welsh started to see a recovery.. which can largely be attributed to the work of political parties and pro-welsh policies of the Labour movement and Plaid Cymru.\n\nI'm very happy it didn't die, it is my mother tongue after all!  But please don't let revisionist nationalists tell you differently.  \n\n\nI just want to add a quick edit here: the current situation regarding self-governing, devolution and modern political ideas should not mask our history. Modern Wales may want to go down its own path now, but historically (as in after Owain Glyndwr!) we have not.",

This figure equates to 883,300 people.\n\nWelsh is spoken mainly in Wales, though large groups living in neighbouring England (110,000), Argentina (5,000-10,000) where it had a colony called Y Wladfa, and pockets between 10,000-20,000 in Canada, USA, and New Zealand.\n\nA few examples of the Welsh Language\n\nEN: My Name is SionAbes, and I come from Wales!\n\nCY: Fy Enw i yw SionAbes ac dwi'n dod o Cymru!  \n\n\nEN: Hello! How are you? Isn't the weather pleasant today!\n\nCY: Helo! Sut wyt ti? Onid yw'r tywydd yn braf heddiw!",

Somehow they'd been given the bilingual signs that say \"Bread\" and \"Eggs\" or whatever is in each aisle. They had signs that said: \"Bread / Bara\" and \"Eggs / Wyau\" that were supposed to be used in Welsh branches.\n\nThe staff decided it was better to use the bilingual signs than to have no signs at all. Maybe they wouldn't get many customers that would understand the welsh half but at least the sign has the english words too so it's not the end of the world.\n\nBut the locals flipped their shit, they were furious that the signs had some dirty foreign language on it. Even though the signs also had the English and it was only temporary and it's just some signs telling you where to find potatoes, it's not a big deal. They went absolutely nuts over it for some reason.\n\nThe closest I had to this phenomenon was using a cash machine in Morrisons and discovering a bilingual option on the touch screen, I assumed it's easier for their IT systems to offer welsh as an option at ALL their cash machines, sounds sensible, I pressed English and went on about my day. Who cares if there's an additional optional language that you personally don't need but others would? It's not a big deal.",

It is possibly the consistently worst taught subject in the entire Welsh curriculum, with most of the teachers seeming to be complete bottom of the barrel picks.  Welsh kids are embarrassingly far behind the rest of the UK in terms of reading age. WJEC (the Welsh examination board) is, in my experience, the worst examination board in England & Wales, with far more mistakes and mismanagement than I've come across anywhere else, and a few years the Welsh Assembly decided to make it the only available one in Wales. If the Welsh Assembly wants all kids in Wales to learn Welsh, fine.  But show it some actual respect in that case, make sure it isn't affecting kids' English ability (as, while Welsh isn't a dead language, its about as useful as Latin in most of the country), and don't lock them to WJEC, which is about as accurate a reflection of the Assembly's attitude to education as you could ask for.",

I'm saying the Welsh you \"learn\" while going to a school in Wales where the main language is English is very little leading it to feel pointless. But in schools where the main language is Welsh you learn both English and Welsh fluently. The reason is probably the same for your father where he went to an English speaking school so of course he doesn't understand it. You don't learn a language if your only going to do an hour a week for maybe 16 years. Making it mandatory to learn before your even old enough to understand the fact you are actually learning a language is perfect because you'll be conversationally fluent before you even realise it. \n\nAlso side note, do you think you such at languages because you were only exposed to English at a young age?",

In general, the Welsh equivalents of technical language/words, which are often derived from other languages anyway, aren't particularly different - they're just spelled/pronounced in a way that makes sense in Welsh. So, for instance 'isoscelese' is 'isosgeles', 'quantum physics' is 'ffiseg cwantwm', 'treble clef' is 'cleff trebl\" etc.\n\nJust like English uses borrowed words a lot in technical/scientific topics, maybe with some changes to spelling or pronunciation, so does Welsh - generally speaking, if there isn't an English word for something technical then there's probably not going to be a Welsh one either!\n\n(As an aside, by 6th form people should be doing their own independent study too, so if somebody reaches that age without having ever encountered English words by reading or talking about a subject outside of lessons then I'd wager that's not something they were ever going to be particulalrly invested in anyway!)",

      "text": "Tbf Welsh is basically close to dead across significant parts of Wales and I'm not saying that to be disparaging. If you were to bet against someone from Wales being able to speak Welsh, unless they were raised on Anglesey or the Llyn peninsula and the surrounding areas (basically Caernarfon), the odds would be in your favour. I was born and raised in Wales and out of every single person I know, only 2-3 people out of my entire family, all my friends and pretty much anyone I grew up near or went to school with (basically everyone I know from Wales) can speak Welsh fluently. This is me talking from a Northern Welsh perspective, so might be different across the south however (although even my South Walian family can't speak Welsh). A lot of people will claim they can speak Welsh but it's the level of \"Dwi'n hoffi coffi\" that they learned in school or they post statuses on Facebook that they Google translated, something that is almost always immediately obvious. It's to point where the village I lived in from about 16 isn't even pronounced in Welsh by the local populace because they cba making the double L digraph sound so just read it in phonetic English and if you asked them to pronounce it using the correct Welsh, they wouldn't be able to, and that's the same for a lot of places. The amount of times I heard Llandudno pronounced Clan-did-no by the average person. Being able to pronounce Llanfairpwll is basically a party trick even in Wales. The problem isnt that people don't want to learn it, there's clearly a desire to be connected to the language with the amount of people who say they are able to without being conversational or Google translating stuff to give the impression of it. The main problem is that the education of it is so piss poor that nobody knows enough to be able to make any use of it outside of school lessons and unless they make a concentrated effort to learn it in their own time just for themselves, they don't retain anything and therefore it isnt perpetuated because basically nobody at home can speak it. When I was taught it in school, it was 2 hours a week of repetitive sentences that are basically useless out of the classroom. \"Dwi ddim yn hoffi fi ardal achos mae'n ddiflas\" over and over again is not useful in most day to day conversations, especially when it's in overly formal language that first-language speakers don't necessarily use, there's different dialect across the country (particular north v south), and the lessons are so mind-numbingly boring. Aside from mutations being quite tricky to learn the language itself is relatively easy to learn once you get used to the different pronounciations and different object-subject-verb order, but even that isn't enough to get people actually learning it any useful capacity. They often would prefer to learn a different language they deem more useful even if it's harder to learn. One of my friends went to a Welsh language high school and when I asked him about he said everyone just used English if there were no teachers around because it was easier and he hasn't used any of it since leaving over 10 years ago. Welsh can definitely be saved, and there seems to be renewed interest in it lately (especially with controversies around renaming lakes in Snowdonia to English names, or even trying to get Mount Snowdon to be referred to as Yr Wyddfa), but it needs an educational overhaul and perhaps even a cultural one, because currently as it stands there just isn't enough motivation for people to learn it beyond a few words (and then pretend they're fluent) when resources for it are as bad as they and there's no use for it in many places. Some jobs require a C equivalent GCSE in it (e.g. police, fire dept, certain council jobs) but a C is basically introductory level and isn't really going to serve you byond a basic introduction and a couple of adjectives, so even there it's not really being used when English is so much more prevalent",

I know quite a lot of Welsh speakers, and hear it spoken quite regularly. Lots of Welsh language arts, festivals, etc. and I've had to be able to speak and write fluently for most of the jobs I've had (in third/public sector) with Welsh being the primary language in a few of those workplaces. Lots of adults I know are learning, and lots are choosing to put their kids in Welsh schools (even if they don't speak Welsh themselves - several non native English speakers even have kids in my son's school!). \n\nSo there is a cultural shift happening, and increasing demand for Welsh language education - but as you say, there are big differences in different cities and the level of fluency kids come out with in English-medium schools isn't all that useful. Obviously I live somewhere with several Welsh schools, and somewhere close to the Senedd so my perspective is skewed by that. But I'd say Cardiff feels a lot more Welsh language friendly than it did 20 years ago, so perhaps I'm being optimistic but I'd like to hope that extends to other areas as time goes on!",

I live in one of the more multi-cultural areas of the city but still hear Welsh around me daily.\n\nAlso important to consider that the Welsh language shouldn't be viewed simply as a way to succeed in life - there's lots of reasons to want skills/language other than economic value, and cultural heritage is important. However, that said, being a Welsh speaker has been massively beneficial for my career and is actually a requirement and the main language spoken in the office in more places than you'd imagine.",
