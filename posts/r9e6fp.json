The cop has the kid in a judo side mount which is not a choke by any means, but the shear weight difference against a muscularly underdeveloped boy is where the dangers actually are. But, from a purely positional standpoint, the only people who actually are aware of the body weight distribution are the boy and cop. \n\nHere is my thing though, how is an officer supposed to apprehend someone without some type of weight and body control. I'm not commenting on this situation particularly, but just as a larger topic of conversation. People will be able to say that any control position is dangerous. Cops do need to be able to control a person for their own safety.",

Actually the word poor doesn't even address the level of inadequate training. It is my belief that if Police trained/drilled daily like firefighters do, we would have some movement in the right direction. The #1 opposition to better training is police unions. They want killology training over, de escalation training. \n\nAs a citizen we should all be pressing our LOCAL cities and municipalities to demand better training on how to work with citizenry rather than look at them as the enemy.",

It\u2019s about power. Cops are taught that they are always right, even when they are wrong, and that the only thing that matters is control. They made a decision, they chose to arrest someone, so anyone who gets in their way is a problem. Any problem that arises his dealt with by becoming more aggressive and more assertive.\n\nCops are taught to turn their logical thinking off. It\u2019s not about who their arresting or why. It\u2019s that they decided they are arresting that person and that\u2019s all that matters. \n\nAsk yourself, when cops pepper spray peaceful protestors, is it because they are afraid? When cops shoot protestors in the face with non-lethal ammunition is it because they are afraid? When cops openly support white nationalism, is it because they are afraid? When cops shoot a person in a wheelchair or a person on their knees, is it because they are afraid? When cops beat a mentally disabled man to death with their bare hands, is it because they are afraid? \n\nNo. They are expressing power. They are flexing their privilege and letting citizens know they are in control. That is all that matters about their relationship with us.",

This cop obviously thinks this type of behavior is still very much acceptable! As 95% of cops do and they all think they are above the law! Current police officers will try to argue this: yet this happens once a week! Hence why they should be completely disolved. Need to come up with a completely different way of policing. Like Camden, NJ or the UK. \n\nIt's an absolute fact given human nature and the personality types that are attracted to being a police officer sadly are not the type of people we actually want policing us! Oh and also you're allowed to retake the psych evaluation an infinite amount of times till you pass in most states as well which is a precursor to even being allowed to apply to being a police officer. This is why we have crazies on our police forces and nothing has changed.\n\nFor instance: My college roommate actually took the psych eval for the police force 7 times before he passed it. You let me take a test 7 times I'll pass it to!!!!",

While I am in no way giving UK police a pass right now (Sarah Everard is way too raw in our hearts and all the other women failed by the police) it was striking how fundamentally different the two are. I can't remember all the details (I may go listen again right now) but part of it came down to the UK's emphasis on crime prevention and policing by consent and upholding citizen's rights, while the US emphasis was on catching criminals. The result is extremely different attitudes as to what a police force should be doing and how they do it. If you're focussed on catching criminals it sounds good but actually isn't about victims and society it's about assuming guilt and getting people in jail. \n\nI do agree about training but training alone can't fix this. When policing is about controlling the public and catching criminals at any cost all the training in the world  won't help. The fundamental purpose and philosophy of policing in the US has to change. If policing was about upholding citizen's rights then suddenly victims of crime are placed fore and centre and the emphasis is on investigating lawfully and thoroughly with the accused being given due process. What a different world.",

Yeah NWA wrote a song about it in '88, and the black panther movement was earlier than that, but Trump made the public messages daily about doing it to *WIN* and doing it to \"hurt the snowflakes etc.\" And regularly talked about how police weren't hard enough on people and had his full permission to use whatever kinda force they wanted. \n\nI mean that shouldn't take away from the decades of corruption and police action, but I feel is more of a highlight that pierced the veil for a lot of people. Which is why Trump is always brought up. Because he was their eye opener for them. \n\nI think instead of taking a hardline against people that bring up Trump, maybe highlighting those other things *in addition to* what the people bring up would be more helpful in helping people understand how fucked things have been for so long. \n\nUnless you're a big Trump fanboy ofc.",

Stay on topic or else you're just attempting to justify drumpf's pedophilia and child trafficking when it is impossible to do so. \n\nNope, it literally couldn't have been anyone but drumpf. To be fair, Putin gave him the actual order since drumpf is too weak to make a call like \"execute my friend\" in front of the nation. \n\nAny placement of blame for Epstein's murder outside of the ones with direct control and influence at the time of Epstein's death (drumpf and Barr, NOT ONE \"Clinton and other wealthy politicians\" made that call. Did they want the same outcome? Of course. They were clients of Epstein's too. But did they have the authority and ability at the time? Absolutely not\n\nContinuing to insist anyone other than drumpf and Barr killed Epstein is doing nothing but covering for them",

And in Colorado they are better performing than traditional public schools and serve community members in areas that traditionally would have to go to a shittier school.",

You\u2019re right they don\u2019t have to follow IEP\u2019s and free school lunch, but all chose to do that here because it\u2019s a charter friendly justification. The main argument for charters is they are not 100% beholden to state funds. For traditional public schools they make their money by the number of students enrolled. More students means more funds. So the union has no monetary incentive to close a  close school because it would reduce school income and reduce teacher union dues. Charter schools are also paid by the student from public funds but also can raise money other ways. So if a school is underperforming they have no reason not to fix it or uptime close it, even if it means reducing enrollment.",

Make sure, to have a lesson plan that meets all the narratives required by all the diversity you see in the parents, students, administrators, state policies. \n\nMake sure you can teach to accommodate all learning styles in your classroom. \n\nMake sure to keep in mind that in that classroom there maybe a Crumbly being encouraged by his money and mother to check out gun ammo, all the while hiding his phone from your view. \n\nNow multiply that by the the other 30 kids in the classroom  with other 'needs' that they have besides learning, let's say Algebra 1.\n\n Good luck. And try not to think about a mega Christmas Party or a huge end of the year bonus check. There won't be any. \n\nThis is a classic defense case of hiding behind, 'oh but what about the kids?'",

A stray bullet from that gun fight hits a car belonging to a bystander. Because both the cops and the criminal are using the same caliber, and the stray bullet was obliterated by striking a hard enough object, there is no way of proving who fired that round. The bystander and their insurance company then sue the police for damages, ignoring the penniless criminal. \n\nUnfortunately it has gotten totally out of hand with broad applications such as \"the officer will not be charged because he was executing a search warrant at the time, and stealing thousands of dollars in cash was not specifically prohibited by department policy.\"\n\nI hope that one day we will be able to accurately divide criminal acts from things that aught to be done to serve and protect. \n\nEven a hypothetical good cop will likely be occasionally involved in a situation where some damage occurs and be the subject of a civil lawsuit. In such cases, if it can be shown that everyone acted in good faith for the public peace and justice, then the hypothetical good cop shouldn't be held personally responsible for the damage to an unlucky car (though perhaps compensation is due from somewhere). \n\nAside from that, however, cops should be judged on a much stricter standard. If a cop chooses a course of action that no reasonable person would think is going to promote peace or justice, such as ending a verbal argument between two people by starting a wrestling match with the darker of the two, then criminal charges and civil *personal* liability is in order. \n\nAlso if a doctor or lawyer can be held personally responsible for malpractice, why not cops? Settlements are always paid out of the city fund, and suing a cop person to person is verboten. Liability can only go to a department, which shields the individual cop.\n\nThese are just my musings on the subject. Thanks for reading. I'm still open to input.",

Hell an electrician minimum pay is $35 an hour.. we can pay some treaty to f****** sit around on his phone all day and run like four or five feet of wire we should at least pay the same for cops to protect everybody... And I actually hate cops but I definitely do feel for working your whole life towards a career that just doesn't pay. So that's why police stations will hire cops with bad records because it doesn't pay no one wants to be one and no one wants to sign up. \n\n\nIt's literally cuz there's a police shortage so they hire whoever. Technically that should cause some sort of a wage increase you know anytime there's an electrician shortage they increase the wages but no that's only for union jobs jobs in the real world they don't increase your wages.",

              "text": "Why are you assuming that the police officer just showed up out of the blue and immediately tackled the kid in an unnecessary and punitive way? The only reason I'd expect that you would is because you want that to be the case in order to affirm your confirmation bias. \n\nWhy would you not expect the tremendously more likely scenario that the cop was given a description of a suspect, and then found someone who fulfilled that description, and attempted to detain that person in order to identify whether or not he is the suspect, but he, knowing that he is not the person, refused to cooperate with the cop, who was then left with the choice to either just let the person walk away, despite the fact that for all he knows, he very likely could be the suspect, or to forcefully detain the person to counteract his resistance? \n\nSuspect misidentification is an inherent imperfection of contemporary policing. Cops are given skeletal descriptions by radio-- approximate age, race, sex, noticeable articles of clothing, whatever the person who called the cops happened to take note of-- and then have to run around looking for someone who fulfills that criteria. It's inevitable that they frequently won't find the right person on the first try. That they don't doesn't necessarily mean they're doing a bad job. It is fundamentally irrational to misconstrue a structural problem in policing itself as the poor performance of an individual cop.\n\nThe above video is explained either as a bad cop, ready to deal out retribution, overly certain he has found the bad guy (in which case he should be executed,) or as yet another instance of culturally rooted resistance to policing, resulting in a necessary use of force.\n\nHundreds of videos of equivalent scenarios having exploded in popularity in the past, there is every reason to expect latter. Nonetheless, in lieu of a more expanded video of the event, from the beginning of the interaction to the end, there is no reason to be certain that is the case, which I'm sure will turn up some time after everybody's already gotten their rocks off by demonizing another cop despite the fact that they only have a snippet of an obviously more complex story.",

They aren\u2019t there to lay their life on the line or be a civil servant, all they are legally required to do is punish people who break the law.  \n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/justices-rule-police-do-not-have-a-constitutional-duty-to-protect.html\n\n\u201cCastle Rock vs. Gonzales, the supreme court has ruled that police agencies are not obligated to provide protection of citizens.\u201d \n\nCombine that with just raw corruption \n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-still-so-rare-for-police-officers-to-face-legal-consequences-for-misconduct/amp/\n\n\nAnd it\u2019s clear why we have cases like this on a weekly basis, cops are buddies with Judges and prosecutors  and DAs so even in the RARE case they get charged with a crime it doesn\u2019t stick or the punishment is a slap on the wrist. It\u2019s the same shit when you see the Catholic Church moving pedophile priests as it is police departments that shuffle around racist murderous cops, they think they are the absolute authority and they can do whatever they want, it\u2019s authoritarianism through and through.",

Upon his thorough search he finds 5 bags 3 of which are empty but have some shake in it, and the other 2 are big bags that weigh about 9 grams just the bag. The officer weighs all the bags to see how much \u201cmarijuana\u201d I had. It comes to 37 grams, I ask him over and over not to do that because he is making it look like I carried a misdemeanor amount when I know it\u2019s 8 grams. Cops kept saying they are following procedure, and not answering why they are fucking me. Basically saying because they can. I asked to put it all in 1 bag and weigh it, they say they can\u2019t because it could have fetanyl in it. At the end of the day I had 8.5 grams of weed and 28.5 grams of plastic bag, and now I have a misdemeanor charge for literally following the law in my state.",

You need to be very accurate or else the \"opposition\", whatever that may be, will probably successfully argue against you. Say two people are in a shouting match, arguing about something. Then one of them gives the other a slap to the face. It's all on video. If the guy that got slapped were to start claiming \"That guy punched me! Tried to knock me out with a haymaker!\" And then a third party sees the video they will become rightfully suspicious. There's a significant difference between a slap and a haymaker, one generally causes much more damage than the other. So making such a mistake is quite suspicious and the guy who got slapped will get more questioned than he would have otherwise. Especially if the video only shows the slap there will be questions for other parts of the story. All of that would be avoided if only the situation was described correctly. And the third partly correcting that it wasn't a haymaker it was a slap doesn't mean slapping people over verbal arguments is ok.\n\nA headlock and a chokehold are significantly different. And the type of headlock the officer performed is worlds apart from a choke hold. Since one restricts someone's airway that WILL lead to death if there's any intent and the other keeps the other person pinned with very little if no risk of dying. The officer has his arm under the kid, on the back of his neck instead of the front. That way the officer can rest his weight on his elbow that is touching the ground. In contrast to the officer putting his arm on the kid's neck and resting his weight there like in this image: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gNuhgEZrcQY/maxresdefault.jpg That small detail makes a HUGE difference.\n\nThe officer is of course an absolute tool, he's using the highest level of safe restraint on a god damn kid, when much much less force would work too. I think he should be fired. But the officer isn't trying to kill the kid. He's just trying to pin it in an overly forceful manner. The situation is still fucking crazy while also being accurate. There's no need to exaggerate. And I don't think there's any malicious intent by those calling this a choking attempt. They just don't realize how the mechanics of that type of headlock work, and mix that with generally getting emotional with such a terrible sight and misunderstandings happen.",

He's asking the public to contain their outrage because he doesn't want Baton Rouge to be the next Minneapolis.",

About 30 minutes later, however, the fight ramped up again and this time officers arrested the 13-year-old boy and another 13-year-old girl, according to WAFB.\n\nBoth were charged with resisting arrest, but the boy was also charged with battery of an officer and disturbing the police, according to reports. He was jailed for a few hours at a juvenile detention center and then released to his family, The Advocate reported.\"\n\n\nNotice how at no point, is it stated that the teenagers were fighting with baseball bats or assaulting anyone with bats. It only says they were wielding bats, which could either mean they were hitting each other with them or could easily mean they were playing baseball before a fight broke out. Either scenario is likely, only one of them is being implied.\n\nAt no point does the article say that the boy was involved in the fighting, or that he was ever wielding a bat, or that he hit anyone, let alone an officer with a bat. He got charged with resisting arrest, battery of an officer, and disturbing the peace. The video is too short, and nothing can be assumed. Even the officers actions, shouldn't be assumed as racist, but they damn sure should be investigated, because that is NOT a good place to end up in (choking out a 13 year old).",

Why the way he was holding him down? Didn't need to do that. It ain't like the kid was gonna upchuck venom on him. I mean, damn. And jackoffs all over the country would delve into his history, trying to justify that another black kid was killed on the damn street. \"Oh he stole a snickers out the dollar general, he had it comin\" I mean do some of y'all even hear yourselves?  I ain't got a problem with keepers of the peace, at all. There's a line. The cop crossed it. Bottom line is the cop should excercise the same treatment he would expect if he accidently killed this kid. The cop would want and he'd get the benefit of the doubt.

Inequalities in risk persist throughout the life course.\n\n\nWe estimate an overall mortality rate of about 1.8 per 100,000 for men between the ages of 25 y and 29 y. This ranks police use of force as one of the leading causes of death for young men. Between these ages, police violence trails accidents (which include drug overdoses, motor vehicle traffic deaths, and other accidental fatalities) at 76.6 deaths per 100,000, suicide (26.7 deaths per 100,000), other homicides (22.0 deaths per 100,000), heart disease (7.0 deaths per 100,000), and cancer (6.3 deaths per 100,000) as a leading cause of death.\n\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793\n\nETA: We focus exclusively on police use-of-force deaths and exclude cases from the analysis that police described as a suicide, that involved a vehicular collision, or that involved an accident such as an overdose or a fall. We provide sensitivity analyses that explore the impact of these inclusion criteria in SI Appendix, Fig. S12. Mortality rate estimates for all groups increase substantially when all recorded cases are included in the analysis.",

I just don't know if this is an innocent, unarmed civilian. I also don't know if this is a guilty, armed civilian. A lot can happen between the initial mididentification and what we see in this video, and I don't feel like this happened for absolutely no reason. I always want to know what lead up to this because both sides will cut a video and tell a story to make themselves look like they're right, just like \"look at this choke\" in this video.\n\nThe thin blue line guys get pretty overboard about it, but I feel like BLM supporters do as well. I feel like no one looks at the situation itself and its circumstance and just throws it all into the same box. Police supporters throw it into the \"cop is right\" box and police haters throw it into the \"cop is wrong\" box.\n\nI also just come here to argue, so I may not be entirely worth engaging.",

The more training you can provide, the more equipped officers are to do their job. That is true across industries and jobs. \n\nThere is one other aspect which makes the US different and that\u2019s the armed population. Police officers in the US are more at risk of death at the hands of citizens than in Europe because anyone could have a gun. Much easier to deal non-lethally with a criminal who has a knife than one with a gun. This shouldn\u2019t be ignored as part of the problem with policing in the US, if the stakes are higher then there is less room for restraint.",

So, the probably millions of other interactions between police and people in need of mental health assistance that don\u2019t end up in a physical altercation are just thrown by the wayside in your argument? These handful of partial videos everyone posts are such a minuscule amount of the total interactions. Even in your situation, I\u2019m sure a lot more patients are brought in by police that are not harmed. I get it, we\u2019re fed these videos and this narrative so it\u2019s just natural to fully buy in, it\u2019s easier. But in most cases, people dictate whether or not force is going to be used in an interaction, not the cops. That\u2019s the hard reality that no one is ready to accept, it\u2019s much easier to have a villain available to scoop up all of the blame.",

If all we're going by is the video, then there is zero choking happening.\n\nThe restraint in the video is unable to produce a choke without the cop either laying down next the kid and rolling so that the kids arm presses against his neck or raising the kids head so that his arm presses his neck. If you are curious, or if my explanation didn't make sense, then what you would Google to see what I'm talking about is an \"arm triangle.\" \n\nWhat is seen in this clip is a body control technique (and a shitty one because his base is weak) and not a choke.

However, this *is* the reality for a lot more people in America than *anybody* should feel comfortable with. Obviously it\u2019s not like, the fuckin Holocaust or life under a militaristic junta 24/7 dystopia for all, but I feel like people\u2019s lives and well being being fucked with often enough to have a never ending supply of new videos documenting these incidents is distressing to say the least. \n\nIt\u2019d be callous of me to tell kids that recently underwent the tragedy of a school shooting and tell them that statistically speaking, most schools *don\u2019t* get shot up and it\u2019s generally a fairy safe time to be schoolchildren. That sentiment, while true, wouldn\u2019t change or help the reality for many traumatized families. It just kinda reassures the call for semblance of control and order in life, which is understandable I guess.",

At no point in the real world can a man twice your size pin you to the ground if he wants too. \n\nLet\u2019s agree to disagree since you can\u2019t understand human rights, child psychology, or body autonomy, or justice.",

They need to be held responsible for every single person they bring in, not just the innocent people, but the guilty ones too. How they treat every person they interact with should be scrutinized and held to the highest professional standards, standards that are missing or ignored proudly across America. \n\nThey need to be scared to touch a civilian without cause. They should shake in their little cosplay boots over the thought of pulling a gun on someone. They should be absolutely 100% sure and able to prove it to a real court that anything they do is necessary to protect not only their own life but the lives of everyone around them, including the so-called-perpetrator.\n\nLife is not a TV show.

I feel safe when I see the Belgian forces paroling the train station. It sends a message, but is not threatening because they are not acting threatening. \n\nAmerica is the only place I have ever seen where cops behave like this. Ever.

They are doing their jobs which is not to attack and choke little kids. If that ever happened in Europe there would be an outcry. This is just another day in America.",

I'm not saying it never happens, or you're wrong, I just have a very positive view of the police here versus the police in America, based on my experiences in both. Tell me, have you spent a substantial amount of time in America like me?  I spent 25 years there, and 13 years here in Europe.\n\nI also am not saying that the police looking appropriate for their jobs means they have been more effective in other areas. I think the police should look like they're ready to respond to a threat, it absolutely sends a different message than wearing the silly uniforms you described, and I don't see having professional uniforms as militarization- I see it as appropriate. If they start behaving like militants then I will have a problem with it. You haven't described any behavioural issues in your post, you're talking about their outfits.\n\nI have had only positive interactions with police in the places I've been outside of the US, so I don't see things the way you do. I can only speak to my experiences, and I'm certainly not invalidating your experiences, though you haven't actually shared concrete examples, just your fear of scary costumes.

Racism permeates every society and is something I see an empowered and energized community around the world doing their best to eradicate. We must all participate however we can in making this world a better place and holding bad people to account, and support those who are willing to put themselves out there to fight against injustice. \n\nBut...\n\nWhat police brutality in Europe are you talking about? I'm saying I don't see brutality. I have asked you to enlighten me because I would genuinely like to know. Clothing is inanimate, that's not brutality. I am asking you to provide me with stories I should look up, cases of the police brutality that have frightened you so? How do we fight against something that we have no information about? What is all this police brutality in Europe that is somehow not covered in any major media source? \n\nExecuting people in the street? Where the hell do you live? America? Prisoners in Western Europe get to leave during the day. They have nicer rooms than my college dorms, with flat screen TV's. If anything, the police are too soft! \n\nAmerican police brutality is not something new, it is not a recent development that happened while we were sleeping, like you seem to think. We just see it more because everyone has a camera attached to their hand at all times. \n\nI remember the Rodney King case happening when I was a child in LA, 30 years ago. That is only one example. Police brutality, specifically against POC, is as American as apple pie. It isn't happening more, or happening just because we Americans did nothing about it. We didn't see every case of brutality across our huge country until the internet and smart phones happened. Exactly how people in other parts of the world are now seeing it when they didn't before.\n\nWestern Europe has become more and more humane by comparison. Also, there were already police executing people in the streets here. They were called Nazis. They are not around anymore, because the European community has refused to allow it. I think it's silly to suggest some major regression would happen after all the conscious effort that has been done to prevent such a thing. Never say never, but I am an optimist. \n\nYou have it very good on this continent, and you shouldn't take it for granted. To me that is a bigger threat, complaining when you have it so good. You have no idea what life in America is really like and if you did, you'd likely thank your lucky stars if you had the option to leave. I thank my lucky stars every single day. My friends in LA would come here in a minute if they could. Many of them are trying to leave the country.  \n\nI know this isn't a perfect place, and citizens have the right and duty to criticize and fight back when needed, but complaining from a place of fear is ineffective for anything.

US firearm culture is heavily ingrained in the American zeitgeist and will be for at least another 150 years(random ballpark number, loosely basing it on household firearm ownership) \n\nBTW, the whole narrative around WHY the US needs a gun culture change is dishonest as FUCK.\n\nMost(66%) of firearm deaths in the US are due to \n\nA: handgun\n\nB: suicide\n\nmake it about doing it for the kids will never enact real change because most deaths aren't kids getting shot in schools. Most gun deaths are people killing themselves, and the rest are largely gang reacted. \n\nHonest discourse leads to real change. Dishonesty leads to more damage.",

Looking at the states where I am licensed to practice law Virginia has pretty limited waivers of sovereign immunity.

No arrests or citations were made but the officers returned an hour later to take two minors into custody on charges of battery of a police officer and resisting arrest.\n\n>The full footage of the body camera has been petitioned to be made public since it involves a minor. The family was given it on Monday and has also retained a lawyer Ron Haley to represent the boy. Haley confirmed that the teenager was charged with the battery of a police officer.\n\nThose were all from the first page of my google results.\n\nBoth the chief of police, and the family's attorney have confirmed that charges were filed.\n\nBecause the case involves a minor, we do not really know the outcome of the charges.\n\nHowever, and this is pure speculation on my part - the fact that the body camera footage was released to the family, and the family chose not to share it (despite being willing to share their own own curated footage of the event) leads me to believe that the body camera footage supports the actions of the police officer.  Were the footage to favor the boy, they would have shared it in a heartbeat, like they did with their own footage.",

When some minorities say it happens to them all the time you just assume the cops are honest and the minorities are criminals making excuses. \n\nEven today police abuse is excused. \"don't break the law and comply and nothing bad will happen.\" Nevermind dozens of incidents of 100% innocent people fully complying to the best of their ability and still getting assaulted or killed. \n\n\"A few bad apples\" first ignoring that the rest of the statement says \"spoils the bunch\" and is emphasizing the need to actively root out and remove \"bad apples\" also ignoring that almost all videos of egregious violations of rights include half a dozen other cops either doing nothing or basically slapping high fives. \n\nPolice represents the governments ability to intervene with force in everyday life of citizens. That force should be limited to when absolutely necessary and held to the highest standards. \n\nBoth of those are a far cry from the current implementation of offering low pay, low training, and almost complete immunity for acting in bad faith.",

That means you can't go to court and sue over some nit picky, back of the book bullshit like \"the officer stood on my lawn after 3am and I have a legal right to have a clear lawn after 3am\" or some shit like that. Look up the YouTube channel \"audit the audit\" they review police interactions and a lot of them end in legal recourse, you can absolutely sue the police and win.",

If the choking was being done was some random person off the street, that would be different because it's far more likely that the choking could end dangerously or even lethally.\n\nPlus, this isn't even a real chokehold. If there A) *was* a real chokehold, and B) it went on for a dangerously long time like with George Floyd, then shooting the cop would be justified.

But with recent events it makes you think, kids of the similar ages are being bullied and then when having mentally destroyed shoots up innocent kids, kids of the same age as this boy are being killed by mentally deranged psychopaths which were clearly created by the school system and the irresponsible parents. And here we have a african american kid who was humiliated and might have been killed just for existing, so overall the kids and young adults are getting the worse treatment ever. The society overall gives zero fucks about them. Gun people wanna sell more guns, police want to get paid and commit crimes to keep that illusion intact of them keeping the bad black kid away from your rich neighborhood. I feel sorry for all kids and teenagers.",

The guy's dad showed up and he was standing on the sidewalk across the street and recording the encounter. Another cop showed up and the first cop told the other cop to arrest the dad who was like 20 feet away.\n\nSo whatever happened happened and I'm not gonna argue about once the arrest actually started. I'm with you on letting a lawyer deal with it. But I'm specifically talking about that order to arrest. Now he was ordering another cop, not a citizen, but it was a completely unjustified arrest and there's no question about it.\n\nMy question is was it legal for the cop to order another cop to arrest an otherwise innocent bystander, regardless of relation to the subject of the traffic stop?",

Did you become a police officer so you could impress your father by being like him and make others feel the pain he inflicted on you as a child?  Was your mother over controlling and you now have a need to control others with excessive force.\n\nYou seem to have a problem with seeing the difference between a something as dangerous as a hostage situation and a bunch of teenagers having a faceoff.  When my own children were young and the few times they got in trouble, kind and caring police officers were called and they took care of things without the need of excessive force.  They were in control without pinning people to the ground and putting a choke hold on them.  \n\nI don't know about England but here in the US we need to cut back on the duties of police officers to their core duties of actually protecting people.  Than maybe retrain some of them into more of a social service role.  Than when there is a situation that actually needs a noble and brave man or woman to put their lives on the line and respond with a weapon to protect others, a well trained police officer will respond. On the other hand if they just need someone to do a lot of the other uncomfortable things we ask our police officers to do, they would send someone trained for that, instead of a person with a weapon. \n\nIt is police officers that think like you that have made me leary of even speaking to one and I am a 66 year old white guy,",

Most barely have a high school education. If you are given the power to enforce the law with deadly weapons, you need to have a background in studies in psychology, sociology, anatomy, and the arts. Instead, you have an overwhelmingly large number of former high school bullies who use their authority to oppress and terrorize the public. \n\nIgnorant people should not be allowed to enforce the law.

      "text": "fuck all that noise... got a close family member who is a 25+ year high ranking officer in the Army, which is irrelevant except for the fact that he\u2019s very respectful of uniformed authority figures and law enforcement. But he\u2019s stated on multiple occasions now that he\u2019d end up arrested or worse for fucking throw hands if anybody manhandled his children like that, like the fuck ppl thinking. Don\u2019t give a fuck WHAT fuckin authority you say you have, the child hasn\u2019t done SHIT you don\u2019t get to just tackle him and demand everybody to roll over. These family members are showing a lot of restraint and when these kinds of important videos are posted, it shows in the comments how much disdain a lot of people have for minorities and the way people *demand* their submission to authority, even when they\u2019re fearing for other\u2019s lives/well-being. \n\nthe cops are choking a 13 year old child, who is literally just living life as a grade schooler playing basketball with his family *peaceably* pleading for the officer not to harm him any further physically. (Promise you this kid is traumatized, that shit would give a grown man anxiety, we ALREADY failed this poor kid.) they don\u2019t even have the right guy, fuckin flagrant and disgusting behavior. Idgaf WHAT my neighbors did, can\u2019t tell me I deserve to get abused bc of where I\u2019m misfortunate enough to live, bc of where I work, or where I\u2019m just living life at. Even if the cop wasn\u2019t applying pressure, you tell me you wouldn\u2019t be furious at a police officer wrestling your baby like that, especially after all the videos of this same situation leading to death of the pleading suspect/crowd to deescalate. \n\nit really don\u2019t matter how you put it, I think America broken, jus throw the whole thing away fam bc this shit is infuriating.",

Insider has chosen not to republish the video and is blurring the boy's face in screenshots.  \n>  \n>\"You're choking him!\" a bystander can be heard yelling in the video.  \n>  \n>At the end of the 23-second clip, another officer is seen coming to help lift the boy up and put him in handcuffs.  \n>  \n>In a statement, Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome of Baton Rouge said she had seen the video of the [\"concerning encounter\"](https://www.insider.com/police-brutality-imagery-social-media-trauma-mental-health-2020-6?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) and promised a \"prompt, transparent review,\" according to [The Advocate](https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/crime_police/article_145e787c-74be-11eb-bdac-cf850648f7a8.html).  \n>  \n>Broome said she requested that police body-camera footage of the arrest be released, but that would require court approval since the incident involves a juvenile, [WBRZ](https://www.wbrz.com/news/watch-mayor-broome-calls-video-of-altercation-between-brpd-and-kids-concerning-/) reports.  \n>  \n>Chief Murphy Paul of the Baton Rouge Police Department said the department was investigating whether the officer followed protocol in the boy's arrest, according to WBRZ.  \n>  \n>A police spokesman told Insider on Tuesday morning that as of Monday, the officer had not been placed on leave.  \n>  \n>Paul said officers received a call Sunday about a group of teens arguing, with some holding baseball bats, according to [WAFB](https://www.wafb.com/2021/02/22/mayor-broome-speaks-altercation-between-brpd-officer-juvenile/). Officers were able to calm the children and left without incident, the outlet reported, citing the police.  \n>  \n>The fight had resumed 30 minutes later, however, and officers returned to the scene, where they subsequently arrested a 13-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl, according to WAFB.  \n>  \n>According to WBRZ, the boy was charged with resisting arrest, battery of a police officer, and disturbing the police, while the girl was charged with resisting arrest.  \n>  \n>Only the boy was booked into juvenile detention, but he was released to his family hours later, according to The Advocate and WBRZ.  \n>  \n>The boy's family has hired the civil-rights attorney Ron Haley to represent him, according to local reports.  \n>  \n>Only the boy was booked into juvenile detention, but he was released to his family hours later, according to The Advocate and WBRZ.  \n>  \n>The boy's family has hired the civil-rights attorney Ron Haley to represent him, according to local reports.  \n>  \n>\"If that officer did not have a badge or a uniform on, and was an adult on the ground with a child [in that manner](https://www.businessinsider.in/international/news/us-police-used-excessive-force-at-least-125-times-in-the-10-days-after-the-police-killing-of-george-floyd-according-to-a-new-report/articleshow/77348951.cms), he'd be arrested,\" Haley said, according to WAFB. \"Nowhere should an unarmed 13-year-old, who is not a danger to himself or others, be treated like a grown-up.\"  \n>  \n>Haley called for the body-camera footage to be released immediately.  \n>  \n>\"I appreciate the swift response from Mayor Broome and the promises made by Chief Paul. However, too many times in our community we see obvious police misconduct go unchecked and unpunished,\" Haley said in a statement, according to The Advocate.  \n>  \n>The Baton Rouge Police Department has faced multiple race-related scandals in recent years, including letting a white man \u2014 [who admitted to killing a Black panhandler](https://www.insider.com/police-release-white-man-fatal-shooting-black-panhandler-baton-rouge-2020-8) \u2014 go after questioning in August.

It\u2019s OBVIOUSLY not working, will never work. Don\u2019t cut police budgets. Fix the root problem first, then transition. Why isn\u2019t this being done. The solution really is obvious. Expensive, yes. But isn\u2019t this cost on society enough?",

Also even in the same force some are just assholes with a complex and others take their job more seriously but it\u2019s rare to see a cop stop another when they do something wrong and I can\u2019t figure that out. Are they worried about losing their job for telling on the bad ones. Do they lose trust of all the other cops. Also I can understand why cops would be on edge in some cities not dismissing what they do but it\u2019s a crazy job. I\u2019m just trying to figure out the best way to fix this stuff. It seems the biggest problem is no accountability.

Bad OP. That's a no no. \n\nPolice in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, are investigating the Sunday arrest of a 13-year-old boy after video posted to social media shows a white officer with his arm wrapped around the black teen's neck.\n\nAn investigation was launched after the video posted by the boy's aunt went viral with Baton Rouge Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome promising a 'prompt, transparent review' of the 'concerning encounter'.\n\nBroome has also requested for the full body-cam footage of the incident to be made public.\n\nThe 23-second clip of the arrest shows the unnamed officer pinning the boy to the ground while others gathered around are heard shouting 'You're choking him!' and 'He's a boy, get off of him!'   \n\nThe officer hasn't been placed on leave, officials said, as it's being investigated whether he followed protocol. \n\nAccording to The Advocate, Baton Rouge police said that the arrest was made after multiple complaints were made regarding a disturbance involving two families fighting in the area. The group was said to be holding baseball bats, according to WBRZ.",

We get residents that JAILS don't want to take, residents that are too much for hospitals and psych wards to handle. I've had literally hundreds of kids far bigger, older, and more of a threat than this kid here. I've been punched, kicked, bit, headbutted, and spat on more times than I can count. We as staff had no guns, or batons, or mace, or stun guns, or restraints, or even adequate staffing at times - all we get is a walkie talkie. Our rooms have no locks, no bars, nothing. Even our observation room (when shit really hits the fan) has no locks - it must be intentionally held manually shut by staff. This is by design. It isn't possible to just leave a kid locked, alone, and unobserved left to their own thoughts and devices. We're there with them to help guide through their worst moments.\n\nDespite all that, I've NEVER felt inclined or threatened enough to start CHOKING OUT A CHILD. The mere thought mortifies me. We are specifically trained for de-escalation and CCG safety holds. All physical interventions require at least two staff, for our safety and theirs, and all restraint is on the arms if standing, legs/ankles as well if we have to go to the ground. No pressure is ever put on back, chest, neck, or head. In my time there, we've never endangered a child like police do regularly. With all the money, backup, equipment, EVERYTHING in the world available to them, why do they feel so threatened that they have to endanger the lives of children to do their job? We never had a fraction of a percent of resources that they do, and daily face worse threats than they do, and yet we never had even one instance. Why?",

There was appropriate use of force.  There was trust.  Television and film depicted the police as a benign force of good standing in the way of crime and evil (Die Hard for example).  It was also respect and an identity for those joining.  That was then.\n\nNow the police just instead show brutality, unprofessionalism, and act with impunity.  We've seen the news reports, the cell phone video, the police own bodycam video.  Not even those work within have misgivings of those fellow officers around them, but silence.  They've isolated themselves and are resistant on hearing any criticism of what they are doing from police brutality to the simplest public protection -- we've seen it in the police officers who do not want to vaccinate in places like NYC and Chicago where they protest.  It adds to the erosion of trust as much as this video of choking a 13 year-old.\n\nWho can blame any of the public of never trusting the police ever again?  Public perception is going to plumb even newer lows.\n\nIf America is to ever recover from its current long period of turmoil, it will need to repair the relationship between the police and the people they have sworn to serve.  Will it ever happen?  I only wish I knew for certain...\n\nnote:  Die Hard is a Christmas movie and for the two interactions I have had with law enforcement officials in the US around 25 years ago, one was way cool and the other started out scary weird but ended with okay, cool.",

Plus add to it, that we just had a very medialized instance where a black man was choked to death.\n\nWell done to you.
