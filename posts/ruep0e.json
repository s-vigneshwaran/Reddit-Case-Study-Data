Meaning that if a 7/10 girl goes on tinder, she gets hundreds of replies while a 7/10 guy barely gets a chance, even if it's a 5/10 girl. Of course that's mostly because tinder is a trash hookup service to feed the ego of people, but this is just disgusting.",

What if we flipped it? \n\nWould giving an ugly woman a chance make her so conceited that she thinks she rules the world? I can absolutely guarantee you that Eilish would say no; that means she's implying only men would exhibit this behavior...  But, since that's hypothetical I'll go with EXACTLY what she said and exactly what you said. \n\n \n\"Give an ugly guy a chance and he thinks he rules the world\"\n\nFor argument sake, let's categorize men into \"Ugly\" and \"Not Ugly\". (This is obviously not the case, as I agree with what you stated in \"beauty is in the eye of the beholder\") \n\nThis implies that all \"Ugly\" men are inherently so low self esteem (like your ex), that if given a chance (Note- she simply said \"given a chance\", not any sort of specific chance) they will now be so conceited to \"think they rule the world\". \n\nSo what does this mean of \"Not Ugly\" men? Are Not Ugly men impervious to this conceit? Are they so used to being treated nicely that they don't have that conceit? Or do they already have such a high opinion of themselves?\n\nAs you said, your ex had low self esteem and turned out to be a cheater. So was he Ugly? Or did he just have low self esteem? Or both? Because I know plenty of men that are handsome as fuck and have low self esteem. \n\nIn your own words, beauty is in the eye of the beholder... Okay, so that means literally any and all men can be put into the Ugly category, since it's subjective, meaning that any and all men have that in them to become so conceited they think they rule the world. \n\nSo are ALL men just waiting for \"chance\" so they can feel like king of the universe, or is that only the ugly ones? \n\nShe threw out a blanket statement over men, not people. This is a sexist statement. You agreed with her argument, because of your anecdotal experience with ONE man. \n\nPerhaps I'm looking too far into it (I did write a novel lol), but do you really not see how this could easily be denigrating all men, implying men are so easily corruptible that as long they are ugly, they can be convinced they are \"ruler of the world\"? \n\nSorry about all the downvotes, if you even care lol. \n\nI hope you reply, I'm genuinely curious about your take.",

Not to say if the roles were reversed an equivalent wouldn't happen, but usually the equivalent would be something like \"the hoe phase\". I do see the blanket statements though, usually blanket statements are horrible but from my own personal expirience, it is very much true except for the use of the word ugly.
