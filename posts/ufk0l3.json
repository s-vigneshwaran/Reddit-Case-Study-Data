It might be protestant/catholic, christian/muslim, black/white, north/south, postcode A or B, zipcode X or Y, Ukrainian or Russian...\n\nDon't get me wrong, for many people on the 'ground' level they really do buy into the idea they are superior due to the way they interact or follow God, but the problem en masse is possible in any scenario where tribalism can thrive within a larger group and nestle itself into the political workings of said place.",

It\u2019s an annoying vocal minority and as a Native who spends a lot of time on the Rez it makes me cringe every time I see it online. \nStupid people are everywhere, and our culture is no exception. Yes our people have been majorly fucked over both in the past and in the present for those who can\u2019t escape the Rez, but these people just make us look bad and harm racial tensions",

This will be met with force from the U.S., Japan, Korea, Australia and Europe and most likely plunge us into world war\n\nI know some jingoistic Americans and Chinese would love to a see a war between both countries, but I guarantee if it happens we all fucking dead.

Whether we live in the U.S., China, or anywhere else, the fallout and effects on climate and food production would ruin the planet. \n\nChina could play the long game where it builds good will around the world, builds great things at home, and slowly reaches world hegemony via a good international reputation. However, China has burned most of that good will in the last 6 years with the ramping up of nationalism. Which seems to indicate that they are gunning for Taiwan, which will cause ww3.",
