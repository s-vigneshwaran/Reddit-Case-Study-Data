  "text": "TIFU: Gave my friend a boner\nSo I (F) have a friend called Scott (M). He\u2019s generally very comfortable with me and  the physical contact in our relationships pretty adequate. \n\nNow this happened about 2 weeks ago. I was with him and a bunch of friends at some gig. It was late night and we both had smoked a couple joints before hitting the road. So we\u2019re at the back of  the car wondering how we\u2019ll fit six people in the back. We decide I will sit on top of my other friend Jade. We\u2019re pretty far away from home and the area we\u2019re driving through is a bit sketchy. Also the roads haven\u2019t been done up in years so it\u2019s a pretty long drive (45 mins on average). \n\nI\u2019m sitting ontop of Jade and her legs were starting to hurt so I move onto my other friend and finally Scott. We have 30 mins of our ride left and I\u2019m sort of on the edge of Scott\u2019s knee, so i scoot backwards. Now my ass is kinda on his thigh but nothing crazy. As the road gets bumpier I keep getting tossed around, so I lean back trying to press into the window but there isn\u2019t enough room for me to make the adjustment and I end up right on top of Scott\u2019s dick. I try not to make eye contact and adjust forward but this on top of the bumps in the road make it sort of like a bouncing/grinding motion. Scott asks me to get up for a second so he can adjust his lap but that only makes it worse.\n\nWe sit like this in silence for 10 mins. \n\nAnd oh my god.\n\nI felt it grow...\n\nNow I don\u2019t know if Scott knew I knew he had a semi but he out of the blue asks if he can place his hand anywhere since it\u2019s getting uncomfortable and ends up placing it on my thigh. \n\nOh cherry on top. We\u2019re both soaked from the rain. I mean dripping wet. \n\nNow my back is pressed into his chest and I can feel his breathing a bit more intensely but I hold back a comment. And then the throbbing starts. I can feel Scott\u2019s dick literally throbbing below me. \n\nHe starts shaking his leg and clenching his thigh but I don\u2019t know what that would do considering I am literally on top of him and it\u2019s only making me bounce up and down on it. \n\nAnother 20 mins of sitting like this.\n\nFinally we pull up to our friends house and when we finally get off the first thing I see is him adjust his pants before walking hurriedly inside.\n\nTLDR: Gave a friend an unintentional boner making it the most unusual car ride of my life.\n\nEdit: Gender added.\nEdit: the driver and everyone else was sober, only Scott and I had smoked.",

So there's 6 of us and we have to cram into the back of a pick up truck the units van was being serviced or some shit thats not important. Anyway we almost manage to fit us all in but there's one female specialist who can't fit and she ends up sitting in another female soldiers lap. The one she was sitting on had a hip problem that's why she was a hold over so mid ride she can't take it anymore and we tell the drill sergeant who told us to just figure it out and the specialist ends up on my lap!\n\n Now I'm not usually so sensitive but I haven't touched a woman beyond a handshake in almost 7 months at that point and ended up getting a rager boner. I was actually really good friends with this specialist to the point where people used to joke that we were secretly dating (we weren't) and it made it even more awkward.\n\n\n Anyway long story short me and her are married now.",

The kind of girl who knows you well enough to sit on your lap will likely not be overly judgemental in such a confined space. If OP actually felt overly awkward, I\u2019d assume they would have just moved back to the first two laps of their other friends and either quietly explained the situation, or said Scott was now cramping as they had previously.

All those other things ended up not helping to counteract the medication hardly at all, the glycerin unblocked everything with 10 minutes every time I used it.

Sounds like they both feel bad about it right now (she made a TIFU post, could just as easily see him making one too if his reaction to the situation is anything to go off of).

Driver died the very same day, my other friend in the back survived only because his skull actually opened up so it did not hold the pressure for an oedema to grow. He stayed in an artificial coma for a month and never recovered, he's barely the shadow of what he used to be. Friend in the passenger seat was mostly ok.

If you're interested....why the hell not? If not, you are under no obligation to broach this subject with him as we men have little to ZERO control of our erections or what causes them between the ages of like...13-35.  \n\n\nIf he's cool-bro, just be cool-bro back and be discreet. If you think discreet is not doable cuz you liked it, then here's an opportunity to see if good stuff can happen.  \n\n\nTake it however you want, but something in him at that very moment thought you were attractive enough to warrant an erection. I ain't gonna lie, one way or the other, my erections have ALWAYS meant interest either physical or emotional. No other results over 38 years of being a dude. YMMV.",

The car hit a bump and his hand lightly brushed my mound while his boner rubbed against me and I gave a little gasp.

Let's just say we took advantage of that bumpy road and both of us reached our destination at the same time.",

So he may have been making a valiant effort to pull blood away by clenching his thighs.\n\n  \n\n\nMiddle school boys, take note. Fuck that waist-tucking nonsense, if it pops up randomly while you're sitting, flex everything from butt to toes, it should work its way out. But don't wait until the teacher calls you up, it does take a bit.",

It's just polite to do that here, it's not a big deal. \n\nI have plenty 100% platonic female friends that I have a lot of physical contact with, pretty normal around here, and nothing sexual at all about it.\n\nThere's this girl I used to have a thing with, stuff happened and today we absolutely hate each other.

But hugs, holding hands and caressing their hair is pretty normal and innocent around here if you're friends, even sitting on laps depending on how close friends you are (though when you're in a relationship this is very frowned upon). It may or may not evolve to something sexual, depending on how distant and attracted you are to the person, but it isn't the reason for it, nor a sure cause of it.\n\nIronically, on my experience the closer two friends are, the harder it is for them to get something going on out of just ordinary touch. I myself have a female friend who I feel comfortable enough with to sit on my lap, but I would never have anything sexual with her.\n\nWhat I mean is my culture is relatively free regarding touch, so it isn't really seen as a sexual incentive in most cases, and of course depending on the kind of touching.",

And they block it- that\u2019s why even a well-fitting one is dangerous to keep on for long. \n\nAnd Okay, then, explain what you mean \u201cactually cutting off blood flow\u201d, because that sounds very dangerous the second it starts.\n\nYeah, but- \u201cHis hand on my thigh\u201d. And yes, I read the clenching part, that doesn\u2019t mean squeezing with your hand. Like when you clench your jaw that doesn\u2019t mean you put your hand on jaw and squeeze. It means you flex and tighten the muscles- she was feeling him go from a relaxed thigh to a tight thigh. That\u2019s why she said \u201cit was making me bounce up and down on him\u201d. Clenching his thigh firmly was making her raise up, then releasing and relaxing it was making her lower down on him. Put a box on your lap. Then flex your thigh, and it raises, relax it and it lowers. \n\nSo she said \u201cidk what that was doing except making me bounce up and down on him\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not overcompensating for anything, i legitimately have no way of knowing if you have a penis. I make adult content for a living. That\u2019s what my name is referring to. This kind of control is a universal thing and understanding for men that can be coached and learned, it\u2019s not like \u201cevery man controls his penis differently\u201d. It\u2019s like learning to breathe with your diaphragm- there\u2019s one main muscle at work here, and the way you position your posture and the order in which you expand your belly and chest for maximum efficiency, is pretty much universally the same for everyone. It\u2019s not like a full-body baseball pitch with 500 things happening at once. \n\nI\u2019m, genuinely, just trying to grasp what exactly you\u2019re referring to when you differentiate things like \u201cpartially blocking blood flow\u201d and \u201cactually blocking blood flow\u201d, while he has no device or hand literally around his penis. Because, for example, that\u2019s not what a PC muscle does, the way it restricts blood flow is similar to a cock ring in that it allows blood to accumulate while reducing the rate it can leave. \n\nIn the industry, much of the work for a man is simply erection maintenance through different periods of intense stimulation, and lack of stimulation, and even discomfort. Sometimes (but usually not, unless I\u2019m streaming or something) for very extended periods. Understanding and being practiced at how that works is essentially the difference between a man who\u2019s good in bed, and a man who is a good and capable adult actor through a day of various sets. \n\nThat\u2019s the only reason I spoke up- I don\u2019t speak up when I don\u2019t know about something unless I\u2019m asking a question or making a joke. I\u2019m sorry if that seemed offensive to you.",

In this situation, it was just an unfortunate occurrence because it was unintentional.\n\nEdit: Don't let it hurt your relationship with the guy. I don't want to say take it as a compliment, but obviously what happened turned him on in some way, so there's that. If it's someone like me, I get hard very quickly from that sort of thing. Once again, it's natural and we don't have any control. If I were that guy (and if you're close enough with him friendship-wise) I would respect some reassurance like \"Hey, don't worry about the other night\" sort of stuff though.

My one eyed snek kept going, she got up, gave me a look.

Why we were taking them to the half pipe was kinda beyond me. It was night. Not exactly midnight fever, but I didn\u2019t try to control it. The clothes weren\u2019t exactly sheer. Corduroy shorts on top of surf shorts, uh, well, let\u2019s say part sheer. The sittee tried to dodge as I wasn\u2019t their first choice either. But, that\u2019s tiring. They settled in\u2026but I\u2019m not that nice. I wiggled it\u2026eventually, the person had enough. The weirdest sensation occurred. The tense spot gave way. It was like a balloon deflating around me. I didn\u2019t say shit. We got out of the car, and walked separate ways. We didn\u2019t stack on the way home. As we dropped off the remaining people, one of the girls approached my older friend. \u201c[Redacted] says she kinda wants to get fucked.\u201d My friend, I think, took care of it. I was already heading home a few cul de sacs over, a perfectly sweet, memorable experience unspoiled by expectation. At school the next day, she saw me and gave me a big smile. Her friend walked up to me and hit me on the nose with a rolled up magazine while laughing. That\u2019s the one and only time anyone brought it up.",

So a little clown pops out of your zipper and proceeds to pitch a circus tent on the front of your pants, and the whole time you are sitting there screaming at yourself in your head \"DEAD PUPPIES, GRANDMAS DENTURES, LATE STAGE CAPITALISM\", literally trying to kill your boner through sheer force of will and imagination.
