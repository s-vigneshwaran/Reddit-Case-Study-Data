They are both going to get out of school suspensions at the minimum.\n\n2. The boy will probably get a slightly worse punishment, bc he's a boy, like that's just how the bias works. What did you expect? They're going to assume he has more strength.\n\nMany schools have zero tolerance policies, they just don't care who starts fights.\n\nEveryone gets punished. They don't care about the internal drama, who caused the fight, bullying etc.\n\n3. They will see his reaction and the extra kick as disproportionate force compared to her push.\n\nEither way, both get disciplinary action. School will probably side with neither of them.",

You're probably a woman and defending this psycho bitch in the video, because you believe a woman should be able to swing on a guy with no repercussions whatsoever...\n\nEdit:  He 'leans into her at the start'?  LOL How about when she walks up to him and gets in his face?  Yeah, THAT was what started the whole thing.  If you walk up to me and get in my face, you'd better fucking believe I'm going to interpret that as an act of aggression and be ready to knock your teeth out when you move an inch.  He should've punched that bitch in the face the moment she pushed him from the start, rather than wait to punch her after she swung at him.  Serves that stupid bitch right.",

Knocked him out cold, I thought I killed him in the moment. \n\nHe ended up with a concussion, broken nose, and a fractured eye socket. When the coaches ran over, they didn't even ask what happened. They knew the kid was a troublemaker. However, we both got in-school-suspension for 3 days after the school counselor found out. \n\nThis video just brought back some shitty memories from gradeschool. I got tired of being the kid who was shoved and learned to fight back.",

What do you think? \n\n> he leans into her **when she gets close** (she even looks down to make sure she's close but not touching)\n\nSo you yourself understand she closes the gap and escalates first. \n\n> He closes the gap **after the push**\n\nExactly, he closed the gap after *she escalated to physical force*. \n\n> He keeps kicking while she's down \n\nI've already stated that this is wrong. You shouldn't kick someone who's down. \n\nAll that said: Growing up and even now, I would never get in someone's face and put hands on them without fully expecting to eat a fist, because this has always been the rule of physical escalation, a very obvious rule at that. \n\nGenuine question: If this were two boys or two girls, would you still try to claim that he's the aggressor? Because you seem to think that getting in someone's face and shoving them isn't the escalation, but I wonder if that's because of the genders involved. \nThe only reason I can imagine you'd think this is that you don't believe men should ever react physically toward a woman, regardless of her being the one to break the physical boundary, but of course I don't want to straw man you.\n\nLet me give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it's not about gender to you unless you say otherwise, it leads me to some questions. Do you not believe a shove counts as physical escalation? You've mentioned that the shove didn't move him much. Do you believe the strength of the shove determines whether a physical boundary has been violated? Do you believe someone shouldn't react physically to a physical boundary being violated?\n\nTo show good faith, I will answer them first:  \n1) a shove is physical escalation, while I do not consider closeness itself to be consider physical escalation, but still a type of escalation. Either of them moving closer is escalation, but it is only physical, to me, when there is a shove. \n2) strength of the shove is irrelevant to me, because the situation isn't about pain or how far you move, but about power. I.e., allowing someone to violate a physical boundary and shove you is allowing them to exert power over you. \n3) I believe we always have a choice whether to react physically to a violation of a physical boundary. While you can potentially avoid a conflict in the short term by not responding physically, my experience has been that that ends up being worse long-term, so I believe a physical response is almost always warranted.",

She put their bubbles together, no need to shove to create distance, as she could have either not reduced the distance to begin with or simply backed up after. Besides, it looks like she shoved in response to him picking about her smell rather than about distance, considering she didn't shove him when he leaned but when he waved his hand in front of his nose. \n\nYou're basically saying that since we aren't the kids in the video that we don't know anything at all, so all scenarios are EQUALLY plausible. Just because we don't know everything doesn't mean we know nothing. The clues we see here tilt the likelihood, so that not every scenario is equal. Your scenario presupposes things  that are blatantly untrue and the only way your scenario works is if we say, \"everything the girl did is innocent and should be completely ignored, but we do need to consider everything the boy did in response.\" \n\nThis isn't all to say my scenario is 100% the case, but I'm not just making shit up, I can see it happening in the video and i've given a description of each. In almost every argument you've had, you've complained about how he responded, meaning there was something to respond to. Arguably, deep down you're probably not even confident in your scenario. \n\nEvery time I mentioned the girl did something first, you quickly point out, \"but he reacted to it!\" No shit he reacted to her invading his space by leaning in and not cowering. He reacted to a shove by shoving back, perhaps too hard, but a shove *was* warranted. He reacted to a swing by putting her on the ground. He got overly worked up and screamed like an animal and kicked her when she was down, and this definitely shouldn't be tolerated. She started it, she got consequences. Bam. End of. \n\nShe either thought there would be no consequences or didn't care. You think there should be no consequences either because you don't feel she started it or you feel that her level of physical escalation was acceptable, as you've demonstrated by ignoring how every escalation in this interaction was initiated by her and by downplaying every escalation she made while exacerbating him leaning in 1 inch.",

Everyone watched in silence, including the teacher who only quoted stuff from the textbook because she didn't understand computers.\n\nI told him one last time, \"Don't do it, Charles. I told you what will happen.\" Another kid even warned him, \"Charles, don't do it. He knows karate!\"\n\nI didn't. And I'd never been in a fight. I had only shown the kid a couple joint manipulations and pressure points, but when the rumor of martial arts started flying around, I hadn't corrected anyone.\n\nCharles yanked the cable and I landed a single half-grown fist in his stomach.\n\nHe just bent over in pain and looked up at me with the most pristine expression of surprise and bewilderment. No one messed with my computer ever again.\n\nAnd to this day, there are adults in this world who *think* they remember a kid in a computer lab who knew karate and held himself back from using it because he was above that.",

I knew a few girls like that at school. The second that someone stood up for themselves either verbally or physically, they would snitch to the nearest teacher. They usually got away with it too. \n\nOne time, one of them pushed a kid who was sitting on a fence railing & he fell back & split his head open. Before he realised, he threw his water bottle at her. Teacher only saw that part & tried to drag him to detention. Fortunately we all protested & one kid had managed to get it on camera (thank god camera phones had come out that year). It took several of us arguing with the teacher to allow him to go to the first aid office.

The sort of people who initiate violence only understand the language of violence.  You can not reason with them.  You can not sit down and discuss things with them.\n\nThis is true whether it's interpersonal violence, or at the national scale.  An overwhelming response to the initiation of violence is the only thing that a person or a nation can immediately understand.\n\nThings like legal sanctions or punishments are largely meaningless because to someone only thinking in the moment, they are abstract and have no bearing on their behavior.\n\nIn fact, such things may actually be counter productive.  The person or nation facing sanctions/punishments almost certainly \\*WON'T\\* admit to fault, and will blame the circumstances they find themselves in on others.  This happened to Germany after WWI.  And it happens with bullies at the personal level.\n\nBut immediate pain is a great teacher for the impulsive and those who can't foresee consequences, along with the rest of us.   Do you often pick up a hot dish that just came out of the oven with your bare hands?   Why not?  Because you likely learned your lesson by getting burnt at least once.   We learn not to do things that cause us pain.\n\nAnd that's what this young man taught this young lady.  You start a physical fight with him, it's going to hurt you.   I can guarantee that she will never do that again, because she will understand what will happen to her again, despite her size and weight advantage.\n\nPerhaps you were poisoned with the saying \"Violence never solved anything\" as a child.  I never taught my child that.  I said \"Violence is almost never the answer, but sometimes, \\*VERY\\* rarely, it's the only possible answer\".\n\nWisdom is knowing when those very rare times occur.  This is why I told him I didn't want to hear that he threw the first punch in any fight he got into.  Initiation of violence is always wrong.\n\nBut by the same token, I didn't want him to stop until the fight was clearly over, and to fight as hard as he could.  Just like this young man.\n\nAs I also said, you don't have to win, you just have to make it too expensive for the other side to win.  At some certain point when I was a young man, I started fighting back against the bullies.  I usually \"lost\" in the conventional sense of the word, but you know what?   After a few of those \"losses\", I stopped getting bullied.  It became too expensive to bully me.\n\nNow, perhaps you find this vulgar and neanderthalic, and you believe that we should \"give peace a chance\".   And I'm with you on that.  But when that fails, righteous violence is the only way to fix it, whether it's the bully at school or Nazi Germany in Europe.  This is simply human nature.\n\nMaybe not in your Utopia, but you must recognize that \"Utopia\" literally means \"nowhere\".\n\nNow, why don't you post another barely literate sentence with profanity and another puerile Internet acronym in response, telling me I'm wrong.",

It settles the score on the bullying in his mind. It might also be a sign that he can't limit his aggression when it isn't needed. Either one could be the case, we just have an internet video, not a diagnostic clinical psychology session, so it is hard to tell. I wouldn't be making definitive statements either way.",

YOU clearly did something to anger them at this point. And for parents permissions ? kind of hard when it is LEGAL to record in public and everyone has a camera in their pocket. Anyway most parents would just be mad at their child to act like they did or congratulate the victim on not being an asshole. Those who would sue have probably some problems between them and their Childs to address first. At the end of the day it's only about justice for the victim.",

However, in spite of that, he still falls flat on his face because it\u2019s so over the top ridiculous to be in that circumstance.\n\nYou, on the other hand, went way too deep and started considering the moral ramifications of having a male adult at women\u2019s high school sports practices\u2026 in a show where they commit felonies regularly and nobody faces consequences\u2026 in a show where the adults risk their schools, lawsuits, businesses, reputations, and lives to win at who can teach karate the best. There\u2019s a middle aged character having a mid life crisis, hanging out with teenagers and supplying them alcohol, hosting underage parties, literally beating up other kids at the school he worked for and no repercussions were seen. \n\nEven the school demographics require a suspension of belief. You want me to believe that in this CALIFORNIA county in the valley where Daniel and has wife have all but monopolized car dealerships (what?) and can afford a home with a yard thats large enough to put a dojo, training grounds, AND expand to include a sparring deck, Miguel would go to school with LaRussos kids?

I rushed at the main instigator, just tackled him to the ground and started wailing at his face. He didn't show up at school for a few weeks, and his boyband of bullies were way too wimpy to do anything without him.\nWhen he finally did come back he was calling him names again until I just looked him dead in the eye.\n\nMy friend was never bullied since.",

His eyes were huge and he said he wouldn't have believed it if he hadn't seen it. I jumped up after being thrown, ran over to the fence, grabbed it, and swung my legs up and over in one movement.

I had no chill and was already 6 feet tall (not sure how they failed to notice that). So I grabbed my trumpet case with one hand on the handle, the other on the end and proceeded to smash one of them in the face repeatedly with it.

You don't want to bring that home and feel the shame again. Being bullied is emotionally isolating.\n\nWhen a kid snaps though, it isn't quiet, they aren't trying to be sneaky, they charge the kid and swing and scream and fight unhinged.\n\nThe teachers don't see what happened, they don't know the full history. The vice-principle knows even less then nothing and bullies are master liars and usually other kids say nothing because often they are afraid of the bully, or it's the entire class that has participated. The bully knows how to play the game. \n\nSo in the past it was the kid who swung first that got punished. Many places it became understood that psychological torture is the cause of the outburst but the adults involved still don't know what happened so now they go with zero tolerance hoping to have some result but it doesn't work either. Bullies don't care about staying home for 3 days.\n\nWhat does work is smaller classes. Restrict class sizes and bullying disappears because the teachers can be more present but no one wants to hear about paying teachers well, let alone hiring 20-30% more teachers per school.",

Schools are too big in proportion to the \"caring\" teachers so these things happen frequently and go unnoticed until the victims are forced to defend themselves the best way they know how",

They know how to do stuff when teachers aren't looking and they often have \"friends\" who will say they didn't see anything when the bully is called out.\n\nNo, schools don't love to ignore bullies and punish victims. Bullies love to get away with tormenting someone until they finally explode and then watch that person get in trouble because the teacher was never witness to the bullying.\n\nThis is why zero tolerance policies ended up being made, because so many times the person who looks like an aggressor to the staff is actually defending themselves. And of course half the students lie about what is really happening because the bully is popular or scary.\n\nSchools KNOW that bullies are doing what they do. They KNOW that victims are the ones who are bad at getting away with stuff. But there's what you know, and what you can prove. If they go after a bully without being able to support their disciplinary action, they're just asking for a lawsuit.\n\nSource: Married a teacher, best friend is a teacher, way too many teachers in my life.",

I watched as some teachers even chimed in on dissing students by egging on the bully. I've lived through teachers and school security shouting \"aye\" at bullies clearly in the violent acts of bullying while going straight Defcon 4 when a victim simply pushes back.\n\nSchools simply do not do enough for children's physical and mental safety.

Walked away and shown the girl she can keep doing this punishment free?\n\nThis looks like a U.S. classroom where there\u2019s typically a zero tolerance policy for fighting. Under this policy, if the girl hit him and he walked away and the altercation was reported, they would both suffer the same consequences (suspension).\n\nFurther, U.S. classrooms provide no support from the teachers in this situation because if a teacher interferes and accidentally injures a child that is a HUGE lawsuit with the teachers career over. This also includes if a student hits a teacher- the teacher really can\u2019t even defend themselves unless they want their career completely ruined.\n\nSo you\u2019re in an environment where you\u2019ll get ZERO support from any authority figure, you walk away and that girl knows she can mess with him and he won\u2019t fight back, and if she beats him to near death  WITHOUT HIM FIGHTING BACK they\u2019ll get the SAME PUNISHMENT? I\u2019m telling him to swing away (if that\u2019s my kid).\n\nThis might be a cultural difference. Teachers in the U.S. have ZERO authority because their higher ups are too scared of litigation. It\u2019s kind of sad that teachers need to pick between doing the right thing and being able to afford food.",

This can be one of many causes in the video.\n\nAt the end of the day prisons have stricter policies because in a prison a guard at least has authority to stop these fights. Teachers do not.\n\nedit- As I hate to just provide points with no solutions, here are my thoughts:\nThe U.S. has the ingrained idea to sue for ANYTHING. I think having a qualified immunity for teachers/staff in some way needs to be incorporated into their position. Set up an adjudication committee that looks at any physical altercation a teacher is involved and decide whether the actions were justified in that instance and qualified immunity is still intact.\n\nOddly enough, prisons don\u2019t worry about this as prisoners don\u2019t really have rights like children. I think teachers who are physically capable of stopping fights should be allowed to without fear of retaliation.",

Well I flipped on him or rather flipped him then kind of just went rage mode on him. I don't remember much of it until a teacher joined the other kids trying to pull me off him. \n\nLuckily I already knew the principal since I did the morning announcements with her on Mondays and Fridays so she believed me when I told her what happened. But I did leave his face literally black and blue and I think he may have lost a tooth but I'm not sure it may have just gotten loosened. So we both got a week suspension. \n\nAt home I was welcomed home as hero for standing up for myself and enjoyed my impromptu vacation. The icing on the cake was he lived in our neighborhood and his mom came over full Karen style to bitch me out and get my parents to punish me. My mom and step-dad( only good thing i remember ever doing) literally told her to fuck off since her kid was the one that attacked me. The only thing they would let happen was a fair rematch. She ended up storming off then but still spread rumors around the neighborhood about how we were all delinquents and should be in jail for what happened to her baby.",

There was a girl in his class, (that also road his bus) that was bullying him, and trying to force him to kiss her. \n\nWhen he told the supervising teacher about the bullying at recess she told my son that can't be true because *girls CAN'T bully boys*. I was fuming. Of course no one knew which supervising teacher he told, and my son didn't remember her name so I couldn't have a conversation with her. \n\nI had already been at the school earlier that week because they were trying to rug sweep a different incident with this girl that happened on the bus. So I was already pretty angry at this point. \n\nThe bus attendant had grabbed my son by his arm, off the seat and put him aggressively in a different seat after he hit the girl in question for trying to forcefully kiss him after he had told her to stop multiple times, AND told the bus attendant and driver about it and asked to be moved before the hitting happened.  \n\nMy friends eldest road the bus at the time and immediately called me from her cell phone when it happened, and all the kids who got off at our stop also told me. The attendant wasn't fired. I made a police report though and the cop said that unfortunately nothing could happen because the word of the driver and attendant, two adults, was seen as more \"credible\" than a bus full of kids. The cop said he didn't agree with that assessment, but the report could help the next parent if/when the attendant did something similar to another child. \n\nI told the school these incidents were unacceptable, and if the situation was reversed the girls parents would be up here citing sexual harassment for the bus incident and saying my son deserved the hit he got, and be demanding something be done for the bullying. I told them if these issues continued I would request a meeting with this girls parents, and take legal action if necessary. The issues with the girl stopped after that. \n\nThankfully we moved and he doesn't go to that school anymore.",

They are the ones who can physically break up fights. Teachers have no formal training to safely do so, and in my opinion should not be expected to put themselves at that kind of physical risk anyway. \n\nThe odds are just too great that the physical intervention would result in additional, avoidable injury to anyone involved. That, or a female student accusing an older male teacher of sexually assault. Both could spell legal trouble, reputation damage, and heavy expenses to the school.\n\nThe biggest downside, of course, being that the security staff need to be summoned and nothing can be done until they get there. A lot of injury can happen in a short time. but still, it\u2019s not like we just let them duke it out until someone dies or the police show up.",

If there isn't a shooting you get all the smart ass kids acting up \"What are you going to do about it? Shoot me?\". Even just the teachers knowing is horrible. They'll call you to come investigate any suspicious circumstance. \n\nNow imagine the stars align and there's an active shooter situation and you're there with your gun. Do you think you, a person who's entire career revolves around nurturing children, could shoot a child? Without hesitation? And let's say you do. You \"saved the school!\". There's no way you're ever teaching again. That's the end of your career. Because no school out there is going to hire a teacher who's shot a student even if you don't lose your certification.",

The shooters all avoided the people with the guns so they could maximize damage in the smallest amount of time.  Getting in a shoot off is going to be counter productive to this goal.\n\n>Even just the teachers knowing is horrible. They'll call you to come investigate any suspicious circumstance.\n\nlol, what?\n\n>Do you think you, a person who's entire career revolves around nurturing children, could shoot a child?\n\nYou're fucking kidding me right?  If one day my favorite student walked in and started to try to kill me and my class and I had a gun on me I absolutely would drop that monster and sleep like a baby afterwards.  Sorry I'm going home to my dog that day, not a hard choice for me at all and I don't think it'll be a hard choice for the other teachers around me who have families that need them.\n\n>There's no way you're ever teaching again. That's the end of your career. Because no school out there is going to hire a teacher who's shot a student even if you don't lose your certification.\n\nAssuming the person wanted to keep teaching, why not?  Far as I'm concerned they stopped being my pupil at the point in time they tried killing me and everyone else in the room.  I'd bet a year's pay they would be able to retain their job if they legally were allowed to carry and could get hired else where if wanted.\n\nWhat contorted fantasy anti-gun land do you live in?  I've carried concealed for over a decade in public, haven't ever been busted \"printing\" or any of the likes.  I hate to break it to you because it goes against your narrative but as a result no one has been hurt and no kids have been shot as a  result of me carrying.  You probably have been around many people who carry concealed and are non the wiser.  \n\nJust because you're paranoid and feel inept with firearms doesn't mean you should project to the rest of us that wouldn't mind an option for staying alive if we are attacked trying to make a living.",

Teachers are very explicitly told never to touch students, ever, for any reason. \n\nWent to college for 8 fucking years minimum, debt out the ass, making 30k, have to babysit hundreds of kids a day AND teach them how to be humans, you want them to risk what little job security and health insurance they have to stop kids from hitting each other?",

Buddy I don't think you get it. In the US, the minority Republican party has all the power. They have no platform, their only job is to obstruct, and they've done that for 30 years, which is why we've fallen so far behind. The ONLY progress we've achieved is through compromise which either actively sabotages things like the USPS or Healthcare, or includes tons of poison pills. \n\nYou can't \"compromise\" with an obstructionists. Because they don't WANT anything. They just want to obstruct, which is why they've been blocking voting reform with their infinite filibuster. \n\n>US you try to say \"lmao your opinion doesnt matter sucks to be you\" and then wonder why shit doesnt go very well\n\nIf their opinions were good or popular, they'd win elections. But they don't. Things aren't \"shit\" because we've been going with the majority and ignoring the minority. Things are shit because 35% of the population, living in overrepresented rural areas, controls 95% of the policy in the country, screwing over everyone in the process.",

Teachers are overworked, paid less, have to manage more students on a tighter budget, and lots of working second jobs just to afford a living. \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to argue that teachers should break up fights without discussing the issue of training and pay. Are teachers typically trained to de-escalate fights? Maybe, but I doubt it\u2019s extensive. Pay them more and they may be willing to take care of their students better. \n\nLets not forget many of the teachers today are my generation - millennials.

Now you\u2019re just skewing my comments.\n\nI\u2019m saying your obligation goes out the window when you can be fired for the exact reason you\u2019re stepping in the first place. It\u2019s a risk reward calculation. \n\nWhy the fuck would I risk my 4+ years of schooling, possible career suicide, and getting fired because two kids are fighting? Should I try to stop it? Maybe. It would be the right thing to do, but if the school admin doesn\u2019t have my back and actively advises me not to get involved, why would I do otherwise? \n\nDidn\u2019t mention anything about getting congratulations, but if that\u2019s how you read it, sure. At the end of the day, good luck paying your bills with respect when you can\u2019t work as a teacher after getting your ass fired.",

The only difference in our opinions is that you think self-interest justifies taking the morally wrong course of action. And that's just a fundamental question of empathy, so no amount of debate will bring us to a middle ground there.",

She tried to get them to stop what they were doing by using a stern voice. She threatened to call for someone. She called to the girl. I assume when it got physical, she called for someone. The physical part happened really fast, and there's no way I'd get in between that. You saw how strong that boy was. I'd be floored in 2 seconds flat. Those kids don't respect adults. If they did, they would have listened when she said to sit down. They wouldn't even be fighting in front of the teacher. Do you really think they wouldn't have turned their violence against the teacher too? So tell me. What would you have done differently here being a female teacher? Not a salty macho male who's intimidating just by existing?",

Possibly lose your job. Be a male and touch a female student to break up a fight, haha, good luck with that one. You just groped her. Her word against yours. You're kinda screwed there buddy. Better find another job. Teachers are advised not to try to physically break up fights. My sister was advised not to physically break up a fight, but to call the campus police to do so (Georgia). My friend from high school is also a teacher and was also given the same rules regarding fighting (NYC) I don't know about schools where you are from, but in at least the 4 schools (my sister was at 3, my friend at 1) they have worked in, that was what they were told. You say untrue. Maybe in your parts of the world. Maybe in your schools, but here and in many other schools, teachers are not allowed to do so. It protects the school from lawsuits, protects the students from untrained staff trying to handle a situation they are unprepared for, and protects teachers from getting injured (and removes their liability from putting staff in danger.) \n\nBack in my mom's days, teachers and anyone out on the street could beat your child, and if your child came to you after being beaten, you'd get beaten for being beaten. My mom left my older 2 siblings in that country for a few (3ish years) and even then they were allowed to beat the kids. Here in America, teachers never beat me, but they had more control and more respect still. When I was in high school, I didn't actually witness any fights. I was in the honor house, and security guards were always around patrolling. I had after school sports and such, but teachers still held authority. These last few years, teachers have less and less power to do anything and students walk all over them. Students talk back, they fight, they swear, they hit and then they ask, \"whatchya gonna do about it?\" and laugh. They know teachers have no power. Teachers know they have no power. So, what did you expect the teacher to do? She can't grab the students. The most she could do is call for help. (Unless she's in some part of the US or wherever that teachers actually still have that power to do that...which seems unlikely given how the students were acting...)",

Where did I say \"caring for others is excused if you feel unappreciated?\" Find one post of MINE where I said that (other than where I'm quoting you right here). Can you? No? Then pull that stick outta your bum hole and read what I wrote. And...you clearly weren't listening to the audio in the video.\n\nI heard someone verbally saying something (sternly) \"Sit DOWN\" \"Do I need to call someone out here?\" \"Allie\" She was doing something and trying to take control of the situation. Those kids don't listen. The teacher is a joke to them. Had they actually respected her, they would have listened. And what now if the teacher got in between them? Do you think they would have held their punches because they were worried they'd hit the teacher? Be honest here now. Do you? So the teacher now puts herself in harms way ignoring what her superiors tell her about fights. If she goes to break it up and grabs someone and it leaves a bruise, she again did something wrong and the parents will go for her. Do you think the school will back her up there? She laid hands on a student. The parents are out for blood. The school wants to settle. Who do you think will take that heat? The teacher disobeyed them. Why protect them? \n\nSoooo... what did you want her to do all while not touching the students? All while not putting herself in harm's way? That boy is hella scary strong. Do you think that teacher could get between those 2 students and not get injured? Can't grab them. What does she do? Just stand in between them and pray they stop? That fight happened way too fast for backup to arrive and it was over just as fast. She used a stern voice, she used threats. They ignored her and it escalated quickly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, all this is us speculating while not actually SEEING what the teacher was doing or where the teacher was. All we hear is the teacher in the background, if that even IS the teacher. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, tell me what she should have done. She's a female, not a male and we don't know how tall/short she is. My friend who is a teacher is petite. She could pass for a 4th or 5th grader. So that intimidation crap wouldn't work for all teachers. So, without knowing how short/tall or small/big this teacher is, tell me what she should have done without touching them, because we don't even know that the teacher was even still sitting, or if she was getting help, or what she was doing. All we see is that short clip and hear her in the background (if that's the teacher.)",

So, tell me what you would have done to deescalate the situation in the 10 seconds it took them to go from her telling Allie to sit down, the 7 seconds from her asking if she needs to call someone down there to the time it started to get physical. She called to her again at 11 seconds (3 seconds before it started to physical 4 if you want to start when she actually made contact.) So, her warnings didn't work and she had 3-4 seconds from her warnings to do something. It got physical now. She has 14-15 seconds before the video ends. Do we know what she did after the video finished? Nope. Do we know what she did Before the video started? Nope. Did this video show the teacher? Nope.",

You throw a lot of judgement around about a whole profession based on a boy and girl fighting in a classroom that is possibly occupied by a teacher/substitute teacher, who we never see. How do you know what this teacher was doing or what they did before and after the 29 seconds that this video took to be filmed? Do you know that nothing happened, or that the teacher was sitting on her butt? No? I sure as heck don't know what this teacher was doing. I don't know anything about this teacher or these students. Cam you tell me with 100% certainty that this teacher was sitting on her butt not doing a thing during the whole incident? Can you tell me what happened after the filming finished taking place? Remember, it wasn't even 30 seconds. That is a lot of judgement there for something that wasn't even half a minute long. What all can you safely get done in 29 seconds? That amount of time isn't even enough to call and finish telling a security guard where you are. And the actual PHYSICAL altercation being less than 5 seconds. Come on man, can you run at the speed of light in that time to even stop someone from fighting?",

Um, I've been going outside every day since the pandemic started and then some. I have a job, so while you were on your bum all day doing nothing, I had to go out and take care of those who didn't believe covid was real, all while not having enough protection to safely do my job. All while not knowing if I could safely do my job and keep my family safe. \nI stayed away from my family for over a year not seeing anyone but those at work and those patients I took care of. You tell me to go outside. Do you even know me? Do you know how much I've been going outside? I go out so much that I'm sick of outside. Why don't you go out into the real world and see how quickly things can escalate with children and tell me how fast you can react and step in from the front of a classroom to the rear of one. You must not know how fast they can be. Also tell me how you do this without touching them or while gently touching them without leaving a mark on them. Too gentle they can still swing and punch and kick and bite. Not gentle enough, you leave a mark. They're not as weak as they used to be when they were small. You have to hold tighter if you want to prevent them from fighting... if you even can. Doesn't have to last but long enough to take a photo of that mark you left while holding them off of said victim. You don't even know what it's like in schools anymore. You don't know teenagers. My nephews 15 & 17 are stronger than I am by a landslide. We just arm wrestled and they threw my arm back so fast I could hardly even blink first. My 13 year old nephew is not there yet, but I give it a year and he'll be there too. \nWe were chopping a tree to move it out of our neighbor's yard and they tossed them like they were nothing. I picked up a noticeably smaller log I could hardly lift and threw it... it landed right in front of me. Don't try to tell me teenage boys are so weak every adult can use force to get them to stop fighting. I'm even scared to get between my nephews when they fight and have to call their dad to use his strong man voice (that even startles me) so they can stop attacking each other. Do you really believe every single teacher has a chance at stopping a fight even IF they were STILL allowed to physically grab a student to protect another one? Reasonable force is out now. My sister literally fears some of her special needs students because of how violent they can get when they have an outburst. She literally gets injured when they have a fit and throw tables or chairs and they're in freaking elementary school. I'm guessing you're a large male, so you never knew a thing called fear in your life. But you can't let them know you're scared of them hurting you again or they'll take advantage and walk all over you. 29 seconds...11 seconds of actual physical attacks, but you want this teacher to be fast like the flash to end it before the video ends. \n\nIf you wanna say she should have gotten physical before the first hit, what excuse would the teacher have to lay hands on the students before they started to get physical (even back when teachers weren't told not to physically intervene.) I did hear words being used. I'm sure you did too. \n\nSo, go re-read my \"essays\" and actually address them rather than say something stupid like \"you need to go outside more\" I bet you didn't even read. I'm actually kind of questioning your reading comprehension skills if I'm being honest. But that's irrelevant.",

He would be at lunch every day talking to students and holding a trash can for trash etc... But I think he was mainly on the lookout for fights because every fight I saw in the cafeteria he broke up. \n\nWhat most students didn't know is the man was a D1 football player, as a middle linebacker, and, I'm told was damn near good enough to go to the NFL but had too bad of knees at the end of his college career. He was in his 50s at the time and no one would suspect the god-given abundance of athleticism.\n\nIt made sense because he walked with a limp the whole time I knew him, but when a fight broke out he was on it like a cheetah. One time I saw him tackle a student that had actually fucking suplexed our assistant principal. The AP was getting his ass kicked by this big dude that must have had a beef with him. The AD came from no where and absolutely tackled and pinned the kid with the most perfect form tackle. As far as form tackling goes it was a chefs kiss of tackles. The whole thing blew my mind, the suplex, the incredible tackle. The man was an absolute unsuspecting ninja. \n\nSo, teachers and admins definitely used to fight students! The good ole days lol!",

And guess how much teachers get paid?** \n\nThen they shove 36 kids in a classroom meant for 24 while well-meaning but misguided activists for reform demand that schools quit using punitive measures against kids because it disproportionately impacts certain groups. So kids act up like this and nothing happens to them, so they get worse and worse. Try to call home on these types of kids and the parent just gets angry and aggressive at you for it. \n\nSo you *try* to teach. You stand up there and kids ignore you, jeer you, throw things at you, cuss you out and laugh.  You write them up and nothing happens. It's tragic because most of the kids, even at \"bad\" schools, aren't like this. But it only takes two or three in a class to ruin it for everyone.   \n\nYou are also expected to complete mountains of useless paperwork. Legal documentation for kids in special services, lesson planning, parent contact logs required by Admin, ongoing training modules for the new fad your Admin thought was cool. Usually these want you to tear your entire curriculum apart and rework it entirely. You are promised this will be worth the payoff after doing it for several years. This new fad changes every other year.  After teaching for 15 years I even had the pleasure of seeing a few that had been abandoned previously brought back. Oh, and that doesn't even include grading!\n\nYou're given a single 45 minute conference period per day to do all of it, and it's probably 4 hours of work per day just by itself. So to survive you try to do it during class time while the kids are *supposed* to be working on something.  And you still end up taking hours of work home with you every evening and on weekends.\n\nSo when you see these classes where it looks like no teaching is taking place there is a teacher probably frantically trying to keep their head above water in that room, and they likely assigned work to those kids which they are ignoring.",

So what we need in part is yes, more funding but it\u2019s also gotta be accompanied with serious auditing and shaking up of school district staff, and probably a lot of new rules.\n\nOne new set of rules needs to codify the consequences students suffer for misbehavior, and require staff to investigate them. And by investigate, I don\u2019t mean \u201cask the culprits and hope they tell the truth\u201d like what they do now. This is to prevent kids lying their way out and prevent their parents from stomping into the school and screaming at staff until they get their way and escape consequences. I\u2019m a huge proponent of parents not being allowed on-campus without specific reasons.\n\nRegardless of the means, schools are in the dark ages, and bringing them out is gonna require a lot of things a lot of people won\u2019t like. Probably because they benefitted from the state of things as they are now.",

From my experience getting in fights in school, most of them can be prevented by separating the students and letting them cool off. Obviously I don't think teachers should have to break up fights, but I think they should be allowed to do *something*. Sitting there doing nothing as the only adult in the room is kind of ridiculous.\n\nEdit: I shouldn't say most fights can be prevented that way. I think most fights can be prevented, but I don't expect the teacher to be physically present in the lead up to every fight.",

I worked with Pre-K kids in an elementary school and I was only in that school 3 years and had 2 parents threaten to sue, one actually hired a lawyer and we went to mediation. One was because she found out her son had lactose intolerance, didn't tell us, and was mad when she found out we'd been giving him dairy (she expected us to keep track of all of our students medical records even though we do not have legal access to that), the other that went forward before jt was dropped was because she felt that her child fell too often on the playground and that having a skinned knee a couple times a month was abusive. Implied that the teachers must be intentionally tripping him or pushing him. Thankfully we had cameras that faced the playground and were able to show every instance of him falling via tripping on his own feet because he was a beanpole of a child with giant puppy paw feet that he just couldn't control. So if that was average then you'll have a lawsuit threat almost annually per classroom?",

Do you think literally every infraction is reported?  \n\nNot every incident is \"sued\".  We get into major shit at our school sometimes that isn't sued.  You're guaranteed a write up and bad eval if this happens and you dare defend yourself against the threat of a lawsuit.  That's what youre not seeing.  \n\nMost don't go through...but you definitely still have a court date.  \n\nAs far as \"preventing fights\".  I'd love to hear your plan to remove the student from the situation.  Hint ..as a teacher there is no recourse other than words.  They aren't listening at that moment.  So you can only call the office and hope help comes before all hell breaks loose.  There will be 10+ cameras on you as all the kids start filming.  Itll be on the internet before the end of the day.  Here's the plan I advise teachers to follow in any school:\n\n1.  Verbally make it known it's not acceptable behavior \n2.   Call office or admins\n3.  Stand in the doorway so that the hallway cameras can see you.  \n4.  Verbally tell kids not to tape it. \n5.  Pray another student breaks it up.",

We had a complaint levied against us by the aggressors parent because we both grabbed him ( and not the semi conscious kid who was on the ground) and finally, another formal complaint by the kid who got beat up because he got hurt.  \n\nIt's a no win situation that no one has answers for.  \n\nIt was 2 court dates.  Luckily in NJ, our union is somewhat strong so we had representation.  Both were dismissed immediately...but not the best way to spend a Tuesday.

He was actually in the same dojo and class as I was, just on different nights (adult class). The word got around about this and somehow it got set up that we were going to clear out the lunch room and spar for the school. All the students and teachers were there and we went at it - bare knuckled - for about 6 minutes. I came away bloodied and with a broken nose, while he had a little mouse above his eye. Then we went back to class and everything was normal.  I can't imagine a student and teacher going at it full speed in today's world. I imagine that teacher would be jailed.\n\nFun fact: my electronics teacher (same year) was an Air Force Master Sergeant (ret) and kept a pistol in his boot and an assortment of rifles and shotguns in his truck. Everyone knew because he warned everyone not to fuck with him. His exact words were, \"I've survived two wars - I'm not going to let one of you little peckerheads take me out.\"  No one cared.\n\nMy how times have changed.",

This one incident, a little Mexican boy went up to a smaller black boy and told him \u201cI\u2019m going to beat you up later, then go to your house, rape your mom and have little Mexican babies with her.\u201d (These kids are just about 8-9 hrs old.) well this Mexican kid had no idea that this black kid had an older much bigger brother in school. Well the boy told his brother and shit went down. The two kids waited in the bathroom and according to my mother who watched the security video. You could watch this Mexican kid walk by the bathroom door, the door open from behind, the older brother grabs him and drags him into the bathroom. This kid gets his ass beat by these two boys. Well of the schools finds out immediately and gets to the bottom of it. The two black kids were suspended for a day plus detention, and the Mexican kid got suspended for like 4 days because he basically started it. So my mom catches wind of what happens and decides to reward the two black kids. So these kids are terrified because they got suspended, yelled at by the school and now on their first day back have to go see my mom in her room. My mom was kind of scary to these kids. So these kids walk into her room with their heads down and sad. To their surprise, my mom had drinks, and snacks for them. She sat them down and said \u201clook fighting is never the right answer but you should always standup and protect your family no matter what.\u201d Lol so these kids got to enjoy snacks and drinks in my moms room, and then she sent them back to their class. The principle now hears about what my mom does and calls my mom to the office. The principle goes \u201cMrs.X you cannot teach kids things like that, you need to take control of yourself\u201d or something like that. She yells at my mom basically. My mom turns to the principle and goes \u201coh you just need to get laid and fuck off\u201d. She said a teacher spit out her coffee and another one started crying laughing. My mom didn\u2019t give a fuck her last year.",

My mom is a small person in her mid 60s and weighs about 120 lbs, so she's basically a defenseless tiny old lady and this 13 year old kid threw her around like a ragdoll.\n\nLuckily my mom didn't end up with any serious physical injuries, but it could have easily been a lot worse. She had a sprained wrist from breaking her fall and she was pretty bruised up, but that's about it. The more serious injury was to her mental health. She was traumatized and terrified to go back to work for the longest time. She developed PTSD from the incident and has needed years in therapy work that out. \n\nSo yea, I don't blame any teacher for not trying to break up a fight.

I am there to teach, not risk my way of providing for my family. If these kids want to beat the shit out of each other, I am not getting in the middle of that. I only broke the fight up this morning because the very small female teacher in the room couldn't handle it by herself.\n\nSo yeah, I usually do nothing but what I'm contractually obligated to - keep the other kids safe and call for the dean and the cop to come break it up. \n\nBesides, I also fucked up my knee breaking up another fight years back. I am not risking my health or my career for some stupid ass kids that want to fight instead of learn.",

Sometimes breaking his nose or a finger or something but he would never fight back because he believed that \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t use force against a girl\u201d\n\nThe only reason he was able to get out of that situation without eventually getting beating to death is because the owner of the company he works for figured out what was going so he bought a cheap trailer, put it on company property, and told him he could live there for free as long as he stopped seeing the person beating him up.",

Places with more than enough fat tissue to completely absorb a quarter hearted foot tap like that.\n\nAnd no one who celebrates these guys who fight back are \"desperate to hit a woman\" that is an absolutely absurd accusation.\n\nWomen need to learn that it's not fucking okay to attack man. And frankly words don't work, so unfortunately they have to learn the same way every little brother learned why its a bad idea to physically challange their older brother. Through consequences.\n\nI will not live in a society that normalises the public abuse of men by women because \"men stronger they can take it blah blah\" no thanks.",

This is blatantly false, the term \"based\" has been around for a much longer time, originating on 4chan near the commonly known \"trump era\" to describe anyone who was \"based\" in their beliefs.\n\nAs the times change, and this \"boomer\" never adjusts, they will be left behind, in their archaic beliefs and time. As someone who is even older than this commenter, the only thing I have to say is:\n\nGet fucked, kid, quit acting like some kind of \"high and mighty\" rich kid acting like everyone is somehow below you. Times change, get over it. You're acting like the old fucks I work with that nobody likes. Unlike them, I hope you learn, and don't die alone and unloved.",

So you\u2019re telling me I have to stand back and not attempt to stop him from getting up and coming at me again?

I just know the real world is not that easy. Let\u2019s say I turn to run and the dude gets up immediately, chases me, and tackles me? Cool, i could\u2019ve prevented that by probably giving him some nice kicks to his legs or something, but instead I had to turn and run because Im the bad guy if I were to try and make sure he didn\u2019t get back up. I assume if I somehow got someone on the ground with my zero experience that they are probably still in relatively good shape and unharmed and I just got lucky because I for damn sure am not throwing out knock out level punches im just a chubby dude. Real world scenarios with real world adrenaline and fight or flight responses does not equate to calm and collected reactions. Again, don\u2019t fuck around if you can\u2019t bear to find out. The real world does not operate like a dream scenario where a guy falling immediately takes you out of danger and allows you to run. If you don\u2019t want to be kicked on the ground, do not attack someone. The way I read your comment is like kicking the attacker on the ground makes you worse than the attacker who just you know\u2026 attacked you?",

Someone who, something you haven\u2019t commented on, could very possibly get right back up and finish the job. Turning your back and running isn\u2019t really being the most aware. You can\u2019t see if they\u2019re pulling a weapon and about to fire on you, grabbing a brick and about to throw it at you, running faster than you and about to grab you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to take your eyes off the road because of the potential danger, or where you\u2019re walking, or power tools that you\u2019re working with, just like I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise to turn tail and run from an aggressor without making sure he isn\u2019t simply going to continue aggressing you. Ive been knocked down a lot in my life and Id say the percentage of knock downs that i didn\u2019t get up from relatively quickly have been pretty few, maybe 20%. You live in a state where you have to retreat, which seems to be the minority. I live in Idaho where you have a right to stand your ground in any place you\u2019re legally allowed to be, like your house or a public sidewalk, there is no duty to retreat. Also, this is all an entirely hypothetical situation wherein im trying to factor in adrenaline and fight or flight response, which I cannot adequately do because I have no prior situation to reference. I most likely would not attempt to keep attacking, I would most likely run and seek help, however let\u2019s say Ive got a friend who decides to fight back and happens to kick the assailant on the ground a few times, or let\u2019s say he\u2019s not my friend and he\u2019s a stranger who was walking next to me to remove any bias, then I would be greatly appreciative of that guy and would be appalled if he got criminal charges. I would be telling Law Enforcement he did what was necessary. I bet there would be witnesses who say, \u201cyeah that dude was getting attacked and he just fought back\u201d. I can\u2019t imagine a world where said stranger is a criminal. I suppose in a duty to flee state. \n\nOn a related side note: I saw a video of a man chase down a thief who had snatched a woman\u2019s purse. He proceeded to lay down a whoop ass on the purse thief where he whacks him on the ground two or three times with some strong hits. This man was applauded and got to meet with the mayor and police chief on the news where he was celebrated as a hero. Would this guy also be fucked if you were on his Jury?(which would never exist because he wasn\u2019t charged with anything)\n\nhttps://youtu.be/q_cobUOMYPY",

Particularly since almost every fight is getting video recorded nowadays. I hear a lot of parents basically priming their kids to use a bullying/assault situation as a way for them to just go ham on that person which can lead to some negative outcomes, especially once they're no longer minors and that mentality is well established.",

There should be some sort of counseling arrangement in place to figure out what\u2019s going on and address the problem directly. There cannot be any tolerance for it and the problem is, most schools have historically let it go.

One of the girls becomes combative with a guy who is recording and tries to grab his phone from his hand. He stops her. She then decides to hit him. He hit her back. She ran off to tell, presumably the dudes she was with, that this guy hit her. The three guys decide to jump the guy. Guy pulled a gun from under his hoodie and shot and killed all three guys.",

My point is that you do not know and cannot control how others react once you start an altercation with them, so try not to do it unless you are ready for what comes after. I 100% think that what he did is wrong and overboard, but do you think the girl cares about right or wrong once his foot is in her face?

Back in freshman year of high school, I asked the teacher if I could move to the front seat of the class because I broke my glasses that day and couldn\u2019t see from my usual seat which was the 2nd to last row. My teacher always arranged the seats so that the \u201ctroublemakers\u201d would sit in the front row so she can keep an eye out on them and you know how troublemakers are, they get along well.\n\nAnyway, my teacher switched my seat for just a day with a black student who\u2019s seat was in the front row. Lets call him Jim. Now, before you call me racist, read my story first. Remember when I said trouble makers get along? Jim sat right next to his friends and got upset he couldn\u2019t be with them for just a class period. You know what he does next? The moment the teacher steps out of the class, Jim walks up to me, swipes my laptop right off the desk, causing it to crack the screen. I got upset and yelled at him, provoking him even more to which he called me slurs regarding asian people (Im asian) punched me in the face multiple times to where I got up and got into a fist fight with the kid. Teacher walks back in, breaks up the fight then sends us both down to the principals office.\n\nHere\u2019s is the fucked up part. An investigation is done and the outcome? I get suspended. Reason? Racially motivated assault. Jim gets detention, for breaking another students laptop. My school is extremely diverse but is a crazy BLM advocate since the principal was also black, along with most of the superintendents.\n\nFast forward 4 years to senior year, Jim gets arrested in class and expelled for stealing over $1000 of cash from the locker rooms during PE.",

However i will admit the kick at the end was not necessary. I do remember seeing this a while back and gearing that she was bulling him for a bit before the video but with the internet being the internet it could be untrue. If it was though I would say that he just had enough and the adrenalin got to him and in the heat of the moment overreacted. You can almost hear it in his voice when he says \"don't fucking touch me\" it sound a lot like someone who has had to put up with something like this be for.

Thank you for your time.\n\n\nEdit : sorry for some grammer mistakes.",

You can believe what you want and think everyone\u2019s just an incel women hater. to be honest you are probably right, there are probably plenty of them in this thread\u2026 but just because someone says the statement \u201cequal rights equal fights\u201d and defends the guy for what he did doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are projecting anything, but rather just sticking up for equality when it comes to self defence.",

Not a good move, morally or in terms of being punished. \n\nUnfortunately I do believe he will get punished harsher. Which only feed this behavior in girls that are about as troublesome as boys, make no mistake about it.

Sad this kid is clearly bullied to the brink of absolutely losing his shit and I don't care how shitty she is it is sad to see a kid get beat up, bully or not.

The unoriginal comments and use of certain internet catchphrases flags them as incels, as does their snarky suggestions that women who ask for equality are getting their comeuppance by being brutalized.",

Stance, posture, everything would be incorrect for a hard shove. We also do know the shove was in response to him making fun of her breath in front of the whole class so saying she instigated it is not really true. Lastly, there is no way someone can realistically argue that his response was only the force necessary to stop the violence. It was way above and beyond the force necessary especially when after she pushed him she actually took a step back and went to refold her arms. Any physicality on her part ended after the push. His physicality kept going including lunging at her and throwing multiple punches and pushing her against a wall and a desk till she\u2019s on the floor. \n\nAgain, neither is in the right here and they both did things wrong but seeing so much of Reddit treat this like it was a reasonable and justified response is frankly disgusting.\n\nEdit: people keep reading further and commenting that I somehow missed something (which if you read my posts you will see I didn\u2019t) or that I am saying that physical violence is okay if someone makes fun of you. Neither of those did I say. If you are one of the many people that replied trying to pin on me then the only advice I have for you is start working on your reading comprehension and stop trying to make strawman arguments. It isn\u2019t worth my or anyone else\u2019s time to even respond.\n\nAlso, the girl literally stopped after the push and curled her arms.

She assaults the boy, who then retaliates by pushing her twice.  She then responds by throwing a closed fist punch and misses, after which he punched back.  As I said before, the kick was unnecessary.  He only throws a punch after she escalates the conflict, not the other way around. \n\nYou\u2019re coming across as a bit unhinged, and I can only hope that being upset has made it difficult for you to think clearly.

Certainly men generally are capable of causing greater harm to women (although not all men are strong and not all women are weak) and domestic violence is a massive problem globally that effects predominantly women, but it also makes men who suffer from abuse and violence by women feel helpless. We've normalised women slapping, pushing or hitting men and it's honestly fucked up that for as progressive as we are now, we still let that attitude slide.\n\nHow about instead, we teach kids that hitting **anyone** is wrong, and that if you instigate physical violence you aren't protected from retaliation.

At that moment, he was (literally) kicking me in the butt while we were in our desks, you know the kind where the chair and desk are attached and you can only enter from one side. It wasn't painful, but after weeks of dealing with varying degrees and methods of being picked on, I was over it. I got up to grab a drink from the back, walked along the side where the desks are attached and tipped the desk over with him in it. Explained to never touch me again... it worked for a while.\n\nUltimately, the bullying continued and he started shoving me while in the gym locker rooms. I pushed back, he slips and  his head ends up in an open locker. Took the locker door and smashed it into the side of his head a few times. We both got suspended, but the bullying from him and everyone else stopped on that day.\n\nI'm not a violent dude, but grew up getting in fights with my brothers all the time (I'm youngest). Sometimes, overwhelming force is the fastest way to show someone that you are not fucking around anymore. \n\nPoint being, we don't know the full story on this clip. Either way, a shove, scramble, and punch in the face seems to be approoriate.",

      "text": "School administration and teachers do nothing to help this. At all. If anything, they play a long if it's a student they like. And they wonder why kids don't ask for help or go the guidance office. Zero tolerance policy is nonsense and nothing more than victim blaming. Why they don't just fix the problem in the first place to avoid it getting to that point is beyond me\n\nSome of the popular kids were in my homeroom with my friend and I. We were the rock band kids and they were the preppy/rich athlete kids. One of the told us to go slit our wrists and listen to Slipknot. The teacher just laughed.\n\nIn middle school we had to, for some strange reason, go around the room and say what we wanted to be when we grew up. I said that I wanted to be a dentist. A guy that had bullied me stood up and told the whole class that he wouldn't want my dirt hands in his mouth. I asked the teacher after class about it. She told me that he was going through a hard time and to be understanding.\n\nGot verbally harassed in gym class in from of everyone. Teacher told the kid he would lose his points for the day which he replied that he didn't care. Nothing else happened.\n\nSomeone said in front of the class I had a knife (which I didn't). Teacher repeated it in a joking/sarcastic way. I got suspended for making threats from another teacher next period that heard about it.\n\nMany times told \"Didn't see it, can't do anything\".\n\nGuitar case broken into. Got a note saying I didn't deserve it. At least the band teacher let me keep it in his office. Nothing further as to who or why.\n\nCouldn't walk down a hall without getting hit in the arm or told I had big nose (I don't). Football players so they can't get in trouble to miss a game.\n\nParking lots were monitored before and after school. My car got spit on every day. Apparently no teacher ever saw it either.\n\nGot punched in the face in gym. Teacher never saw it. Same kid called me and my band \"f\\*\\*s\" too.\n\nGuidance counselor met with every senior. Asked what I was doing. Told them college. They asked if I applied to any. Told them 1 and that I was accepted and proceeded to walk out.\n\nWe all had to do pull-ups in front of the class in gym. I had my arm in a sling as I hurt it and couldn't put more than 15lbs on it. He told me to put only that much weight on it for the pull-up. Very embarrassing.\n\nThe point is that this stuff happens all the time. When the school fails you, you just kind of give up and let it happen. And what do you when it's the school making it worse? Who is going to help you at that point?",

Probably would have ended after some shoving if she hadn\u2019t attempted to strike his face with her fist.  This reason I don\u2019t find it funny is she probably got injured when her head hit the table and the kick afterwards for him was unwarranted.  That was letting anger get the best of him and not really a self defense action.  She could have gotten very hurt and I hope she it ok. \n\nThe other reason I don\u2019t find this funny is alluded to in the post title.  She didn\u2019t expect him to fight back for a reason.  Males are expected to take assaults and abuse from women in today\u2019s society unfortunately.   Many times males are the victim of female bullying,harassment, and abuse but it isn\u2019t believed or taken seriously.   She didn\u2019t expect him to do anything because society conditions us to assume he shouldn\u2019t protect himself and that he couldn\u2019t possibly be the victim because he is a male.  She knows this so she feels she has the freedom to bully and harass him all she wants.   She knows she holds all the power in this situation when it comes to how people will react because today in society being male=bad, woman=victim.  She abuses this dynamic for her own gain and satisfaction.  Ends up with a bad outcome for both parties that I wish neither had to experience.",

She was someone in charge, not a teacher though. Probably some after school program person. Their method to deal with an (what I assume was) an unruly student was completely incorrect. You do not approach and attempt to intimidate a student by stepping into their personal space - you never know what the kid will do and it is incredibly rude. She had her arms crossed so that it would be obvious she wasn\u2019t touching him, but then she pushed him\u2026 because she couldn't handle kids being stupid\u2026  at best she gets away with assault, at worst\u2026this.

It is more than half a decade old and I sit the front page a half dozen times at least.  Every single day for the last 2 months there has been at least one front page post about a man being morally justified (and I'm not saying the most of them circumstances they're not) to hit a woman with comment threads filled with \"equal rights deserve equal lefts\" all while be moaning the fact that women are allowed to get away with violence while men aren't.  That is an obsession with the idea that women somehow get away with violence while men don't.  I would wager that most of the men commenting in these threads are not identifying with the victim (s) of the violence, but instead identify with a theoretical perpetrator who, in their minds, can't get away with doing whatever it is the woman was trying to get away with.  Which is ironic because in virtually all of these videos the woman does get severe consequences for her violence.\n\n\"By your logic Reddit is obsessed with yelling at men for defending themselves, i.e. yourself. \".  I'm not sure what you mean by that, or what \"yourself\" refers to in this.  Could you explain?",

The dude who won was significantly larger than the dude with the bat, so for all we knew he might have grabbed it to defend himself.\n\nThis sub can be pretty barbaric with how they view justice, and often cheers for disproportionate violent responses to mundane actions.",

When a boy bullies a girl, he obviously likes her, so it's not really bullying it's just harmless flirting (wtf?).\nThat would explain these disgusting responses: he can't be the bully because he's 1) a boy who would never bully a girl and 2) sooooo much smaller than her! She's a heavyweight champion and he managed to beat her! What a hero! /s\n\nI can't with these misogynistic commenters!\n\nAnd the mentions of her size, fuuuuuck me. Do they not remember primary school? Everyone was small and then in like a month a couple of boys and most of the girls outgrew the whole class. Most girls were taller than most boys for like at least a year. I remember most of my male classmates (who are now like 5'8\" or 9\" at the shortest) being 5'3\" tops until they were 15. They were tiny in primary school.\nThis girl is just taller, she really doesn't look like she weighs more than the boy.\n\nAlso, how do these commenters not hear the hate in his scream at the end? That doesn't sound like a frustrated kid defending himself, it's definitely way more hateful. Like he was pissed she dared push him after the \"your breath stinks\" gesture (which he obviously made towards the classmates to get a laugh) and make him look bad in front of the class. Can you not see that she's cornered? He can walk away any time, she's standing there with her back against the wall and him in the way of her only exit. What are these people on?",

A response worth waiting for!\n\nAnyway, we don't know what happened before this altercation, but I remain firm in my interpretation. I've seen way too many bullies who were \"only\" taunting their victims (this usually happens when a boy bullies a girl: the abuse isn't physical, it's mental) get away with it, just because the victim fought back after long periods of mental abuse (and not immediately after bullying started). The victim of bullying snaps and then the bully is the victim, because they were just defending themselves against this crazy person who hit them.\n\nI didn't want to pull the I-actually-know-what-I'm-talking-about card, but I actually see situations that are almost identical to this one in my line of work all the time and I know that it might be very difficult for you to understand, but I'm telling you, this is basically textbook. She snapped. The boy is the bully. He's exhibiting the type of agression that victims of bullying usually don't. They don't know how to fight (back) and so when/if the do, it doesn't end well for them most of the time. See: girl on floor.\n\nReally loving the pile up and the mysogyny, tho, makes me feel SO great knowing how many of you guys are so proud of this poor little boy for fighting back. Yay, you beat up a girl! Way to go, kiddo! You show her! How dare she stand up for herself?! She's a girl! Her place is on the floor, getting kicked! Nice practice for further relationships.

I jumped up from the table and backed off, didn\u2019t even think of hitting her like this guy did, I\u2019d always been taught you could never hit a girl. She continued after me, swiping the compass towards my face, I continued to back off and then the teacher noticed and called my name. The stabber sat down, and the teacher told me to go back to my seat. I asked to be moved, explained what had happened, and showed my bleeding hand. The class laughed. The teacher said that I deserved it and told me to sit back down. I refused, and was thrown out of the class. My parents got a letter, and then I was given shit at home for weeks.\n\nI hold no ill will towards this girl. We were probably 13/14 years old and you do stupid shit at that age. I do hold ill will towards the teaching staff who thought that behaviour was okay, and my parents, who failed to do so much as to tell me my life was worth something when I was really hurting.",

Because *that* actually goes way past a rage moment into pure malevolence, with a very real risk of permanently damaging someone. \n\n\nA finishing kick in the side as that piece of shit is on the ground seems like a fair end of the non-verbal discussion in this case.

His response was disproportionate and he didn\u2019t stop even after she was immobilized. You can catch a aggravated assault charge even for one punch if you seriously injure someone. It mostly depends on circumstance and the prosecutors mood at that moment. Just because you don\u2019t know your arse from a hole in the ground doesn\u2019t mean you have to be rude. Have the day you deserve.",

As far as equality goes, yes, I believe in social equality for all. That, however, does not mean that the average woman is suddenly equally as strong as the average male. Are there instances where a man might have to physically take down a woman? Of course. But the majority of these videos show some little piss ant dude who only fights back because he knows he's dealing with someone physically weaker. It doesn't make the actions of the female okay, btw. But any real man who isn't completely insecure in their masculinity could figure out a way to deal with a woman who has simply pushed or slap him. Bear hug, pen down, walk away -- lots of options that don't involve punching AND THEN FUCKING KICKING her when she's down. JFC you piss ants are pathetic.",

Could this be months or years of pent-up rage against a bully who has never stopped? Yes. Could this *also* be a bully with a short fuse exploding loudly and violently the moment he encounters any minor retaliation? Also yes.\n\nI got bullied in school. But it was always the jokester asshole doing the bullying with snide remarks and mean comments to try and get people to laugh. I realize I'm the one projecting now, but I see this kid and think back to my bullies over the years and I wonder if he's actually the bully in this situation.",

Many would call the kick at the end excessive as a technicality, but after watching it a dozen times, I would argue it was a preventative intimidation threat to prevent her from getting back up and attacking him again. People have a subjective argument at that point, but I personally don't see him losing control or being excessive. He had her prone and could have 'curb stomped' her and done serious and permanent damage and he didn't. He warned her- but that's my interpretation.   \n\n\nYour example moves the goalposts and again relies on exaggeration and hyperbole to make it's point. It marginalizes the victim calling the original assault no big deal. I'll humor you though...  \n\n\nIn your example, is my child with me? I am seldom in public without him. Is the assaulter escalating violence against me? If I perceived a continuous danger to me and my child, if I let the assault continue to the point of being incapacitated then my child is in mortal danger. I would have every justification in using deadly force. I would walk free, and sleep like a baby.  \n\n\nIn your example, am I carrying a concealed firearm? If I am incapacitated, will the assailant acquire the firearm and go on to either dispatch my unconscious body or use the weapon to assault or kill someone else? I would have the responsibility to defend myself, using deadly force if necessary to prevent that mayhem and further loss of life.  \n\n\nIt is absolutely wrong to lay hands on someone else.

So if someone shoved me even if it was malicious- we'd be fine. If they continued an assault where I felt I was in mortal danger, or others were in mortal danger I wouldn't serve a day of time.   \n\n\nHere's the kicker- I think that kid in Wisconsin (Rittenhouse if you want to look it up) that got off after killing two people and injuring a third- he should be in jail serving 25 to life x2 consecutively.

I don\u2019t understand the rest of your words, but I stand by the fact that a man should never hit a woman. It doesn\u2019t mean that a man can hit another man, it means a man is almost always much stronger than a woman, and that would be a really really stupid thing to do. Be careful, that doesn\u2019t mean I am saying it\u2019s OK to hit a man, it only means a man CANNOT hit a woman, a man should never hit anyone, but a woman is an answer to this problem. I could say a man should never hit anything or anybody, but (again) I was answering the statement.

Long story short Licking county school board is corrupt and profiles people based on their gender and looks, they expelled him barred him from coming back the year after. So, I found out who the girls were, found out where they hung out, and warned them that if they didn't come forward and tell the truth some very bad things could happen to them (Mayor owed me a favor and my friend and I had a lot of good friends on the police force), they laughed and said, \"Wow that gay little bitch has to have his brother fight for him?\", so the next week the main girls parents were arrested for drug trafficking.\n\nThey were real quick about coming forward after that.",

Don't remember my tone, just that I said no.\n\nShe got really pissy and decided to charge up and kick me in the balls. I screamed out in pain and in the haze managed to punch her with my pillow hands. She cried bloody murder. Teacher did not care that I got attacked first. I was written up, sent home and suspended for hitting a girl. My mom came and got me and beat my ass for hitting a girl. She didn't care that I was attacked either.

Long story short, this dudes taking the fall for it, so I tell him to get the F out of my house.Hes telling me to make him, so I push him out my front door \ud83d\udeaa he laughs comes back in, I push him again he comes back in, and the third time he supposedly hits his head in the doorway, and tees off on my little R.L.Stine Goosebumps face ass, my couch is right behind me, so when I try to walk back I\u2019m tumbling over the couch \ud83d\udecb I got haymaker\u2019d a good 4-5 times, and immediately lunge back to my feet....and that\u2019s when I realized how much bigger this dude is than me.(it never really Registered because we were supposedly friends) and I\u2019m standing there looking back at him (pain hasn\u2019t kicked in yet, at this point I literally don\u2019t feel any pain) but it\u2019s that moment anyone who\u2019s ever been a fight or contemplated fighting has considered.....fuck do I really wanna fight this guy?

Nope \ud83d\udc4e I\u2019d be getting off the \ud83d\ude8c bus and I\u2019d hear my friends yelling from the bus, watch out! Watch out !

Not because I was in pain, I wasn\u2019t, at least not physical, but here I am in sixth grade dealt a shit hand, prior to moving here, I had blown in a breathalyzer, tricked by my pops because he had to \u201cpay a coworker\u201d watched my pops get arrested for buying crack, living with a single mother working her ass off night and day, rocking hand me down clothes, and this redneck fuck wants to choose me to fuck with not anyone his size or anything but me.....I\u2019ve been looking forward my entire adult life of getting to \u201crun it back\u201d with this fool.",

As a kid, I loved martial arts movies, especially the Jackie Chan ones. So, I decided that day to bluff. I warned him that I knew karate, and I didn't want to fight but I would hurt him if we did. I was absolutely terrified. He didn't believe me, and charged straight at me to tackle me. In a panic, I dodged to the side and tried to push him away from me, and it resulted in me accidentally flipping him onto the ground over my leg in a singular smooth motion as if I did in fact know karate. I was never bullied again, and I still wonder to this day how many of my classmates think I was secretly some martial arts legend.",

Then they touched me. A slap to the back of my head. We all learned that's where my full rage button is. I stood up and knocked that kid flat with four knuckles to his nose. He was also a big kid so the takedown was admirable. Then looking at his friend who always ran his mouth at me I slowly raised my fist and said, \"Do you want some too?\". Intant respect from that moment forward. Nobody messed with me and I was free to be my gentler self. On many occasions I came to the aid of others who didn't have the size to physically fight as I did. It never came to a fight. Bullies just want an easy target to dump their own feelings of inadequacy on. I'd challenge them by saying things like, \"Don't add more ugly, nasty, hatefulness to the world. There's enough of that. Just be kind.\"",

The thing is when you\u2019re the target of a bully you absolutely have the right to defend yourself. She started it.

He took it out of the arena of interpersonal argument and took it right to embarrassing her in front of everybody. I can fully understand her snapping and shoving him. I don't in the least agree with being shoved being sufficient to initiate a fist fight and then when she's down kick her.

And each step he adds a level of escalation.\nI\u2019m not saying she won\u2019t get in trouble too.\nBut if you do this shit in real life. As an adult.\nYou will go to jail.\nEvery city is filled with dozens and dozens of bars and pubs and nightclubs.\nWhich are full of drunk people. So conflict happens. \nPeople have to learn to deescalate conflict. \nHigh school (?) is hard I imagine because you will be around the same people for a long time and they are immature and you won\u2019t be rewarded for walking away from conflict.\n\nThe victim blaming thing won\u2019t work. It may feel unfair.\nBut once the kid hurts her significantly more than he was hurt she is now more of a victim.\nHe may be a victim of bullying, which is bad.\nBut the other person is a victim of assault. An actual serious crime.\n\nBut I am just saying real life isn\u2019t road house, it isn\u2019t an anime or an action movie.\nYou will get in trouble for fighting. Particularly if you are dominating the fight and don\u2019t relent. \nIt sounds like she hit her head on the table on the way down.\nIf you hit someone in the jaw or temple with some snap. It can bounce there brain against their own skull and knock them out. Which is cool. But an unconscious person falling can\u2019t protect their head. And can lead to serious injury or death.\n\nIn Australia we call a haymaker punch, a KING HIT, cause it is such a big devastating punch.\nThe government had to rebrand it as the Coward punch. Because people getting hit kept falling and hitting their heads on the ground and dying. Or being hospitalised.\n\nAnyway there are ways to stand up for yourself without knocking someone out in class.",

      "text": "Some misconceptions here. Self-defense isn't anything goes. Self-defense is a **legal concept, established by law.** It's the minimum force necessary to defend oneself from an immediate, physical threat. It's not anything goes. It's not a *ding-ding* fight bell ringing for a no holds barred fight. It's not a return to some kind of lawless, primal state. Self-defense merely allows you to a previously established allowable conduct under the law. Because nothing, even the other's lawless conduct, allows you to act lawlessly. And *anything goes* retaliation is by definition lawless, and if you're relying on the self-defense **law** to justify your conduct, your response cannot itself be **lawless.**\n\nAny time you escalate force, you risk falling outside the allowable confines of self-defense. Any time there's any a large gap in the ability to do harm, you risk falling outside the allowable self-defense. Saying that it doesn't matter whether the participants are men or women simples ignores the biomechanical differences between men and women and their ability to inflict harm on the other.\n\nI know people will react viscerally to this, but as a man, if you punch a woman as hard as you can because the woman punched you as hard as she could, you risk getting in a lot of trouble. Because an average man's hard punch has much greater potential for damage than an average woman's hard punch. Of course, there are individual differences. A woman boxer's punch may in fact hit harder than a frail man's. But generally speaking, a man is going to hit harder than a woman, and since self-defense must be predicated on *equivalent response*, a man is liable to get in trouble.\n\nA weapon throws all this right out the window, of course, unless she's throwing a slipper at you or something. I'm talking knife or gun or even a sturdy stick.",

The middle school fight is kinda fuzzy to me still but the high school one was clear as day. It was the last week in my senior year and we were all just chilling out, waiting for the bell and stuff like that. I see my two classmates, one pale skinned ginger and the other who was Mexican with black hair. Now look, I never knew what the reason behind what happened was\u2026\u2026but I can sure as hell tell you it happened out of fucking nowhere. I\u2019m sitting in the back of the class, near the door and on my phone waiting to leave. Suddenly I see two random desks move pretty harshly, next thing I see is the two dudes going AT IT. The ginger even got slammed into a nearby filing cabinet and they didn\u2019t stop. Teacher got in there pretty quickly to break them apart, he was a retired officer so he got that grapple in and ended it fast. But I won\u2019t ever forget the face of the ginger guy when he got punched in the nose, just staring with daggers as blood ran down his nose\u2026.Jeez\u2026.",
