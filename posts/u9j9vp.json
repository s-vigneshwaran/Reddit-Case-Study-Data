Calling a lawyer about corruption in the system will just be met with laughs.  Anyone who isn't a complete moron knows that our system is beyond correction through typical means.\n\nEven the very few agencies taking this approach, say Veritas, Judicial Watch, etc... Have been having VERY LITTLE success despite having millions of dollars in donations to accomplish their goals.\n\nAnd, even when they do win?  Well, the media and social media are complicit with the corruption and tell almost no one.\n\nJust look at how much the news has covered the Pf.izer Vac FOIA paperwork.  Zero coverage.\n\nOr Hunter Bidens/Joe Bidens business dealings, which have been known about prior to the election.  Censored to help control the election.\n\nI don't think you fully grasp exactly how far gone this is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Otherwise you were, and are,  just as screwed as the rest of us as soon as Citizen\u2019s United passed, and was later upheld by the party who says the want to uphold personal freedoms.\n\nI had never claimed I was any less screwed.  Not sure why you jumped to that, as if I had somehow claimed I was immune to this corruption (I am not).\n\nFurther, Citizen's United has done nothing except force donations from rich oligarchs to be 'clumped' into groups which contain mostly rich oligarchs.  An example would be the donations Biden received through Alphabet, and various schools which were revealed to have been channeling donations from Russia and China to Biden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>We are so beholden to never giving an inch on 2A or Abortion, and so easily riled up by people\u2019s sexuality and religious choices, that we are watching our freedoms get stripped en masse.\n\n2A should never be touched, just like religious freedom and freedom of speech, and idiots should be educated on what our forefathers actually thought and understood rather than parrot what CNN tells you your point of view should be on it.  \n\nUNALIENABLE RIGHTS.\n\nAbortion is an emotional issue which effects very little unless you are such a frivolous slut that you constantly are getting knocked up and need to exercise that right enough for it to have a huge role in your life.  Most pro lifers care very little what you do with your own body, just like most pro-abortion people care very little that other people want to keep their babies.  It is a very vocal minority that wants to control the other side, on both sides.\n\nSome, almost too vocal, like Bill Gates.\n\nThe whole point of this being the United States is there are states which support your opinions where you belong, and you are welcome to go there.  There are states which do not, and you are not welcome there and should not attempt to change their way of life simply because you do not agree with them.\n\nThe Fed was never meant to control the beliefs of others, or work against our Bill of Rights.  The only reason we created the United States was an agreement to uphold our constitution and Bill of Rights, and undoing that will likely result in dissolving said union and inciting a civil war.\n\nI get some people are too stupid to get any of this, and merely want their way at any cost.\n\nIt is my personal belief anyone attempting to stymy my 2A rights should be dealt with violently, as they are corrupt and attempting to limit my rights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>If we want a true government for the majority of the people, \n\nNo thanks.\n\nThat is what is called the tyranny of the masses.  Which would likely lead to a lot more issues than we currently even have.\n\nWhich is why we aren't really a democracy, but instead, a democratic republic.\n\nThat has its own issues, which is, elected officials have to be kept in check.  Which we are doing a very, very, poor job at.\n\nThe fact people are more upset about the Jan 6th riots than the corruption which has been demonstrated by the CIA, FBI, and DEA speaks volumes as to how lost this nation is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>we will all need to recognize that we actually have to respect one another\u2019s freedoms, religious and otherwise.\n\nThis is true on both sides of the argument, yes.  People need to be educated on their ability to relocate to a place where people agree with their way of life, like they used to be.  \n\nIf you have Mormon views, you are very welcome in Utah.\n\nIf you have left wing, anti-gun beliefs, Southern California will always take you in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I don\u2019t see that happening given the cesspool of twitter, FB, Instagram, Telegram, and the echo chambers like Reddit and parler.  We are so consumed by having arguments like this one, that we will never get past them.\n\nFacebook has 2.9 billion active users.\n\nTwitter has 206 million.\n\nReddit has 48 million.\n\nParler has 1 million.\n\nThere is no real place for the right, and that is the real issue here.  Even Parler isn't that great because it became quickly over-run with the more extreme people on the right, which drove a way a lot more of the centrist groups.\n\nFacebook, Twitter, and Reddit are EXTREMELY liberally minded, which tend to outright ban anyone espousing Conservative or Republican views.\n\nSo you have a mostly politically left set of websites which is doing its best to brainwash youth into the shittiest ideologies every devised by man, at the expense of everyone else.\n\nThat is the issue.  Which is far past being a mere echo chamber.",

This may be true\u2026but you still haven\u2019t pointed out Pelosi\u2019s treason. \n\nDo you know how serious treason is? MTG, a congresswoman, screeched into a microphone that Pelosi committed treason and treason deserves execution. \n\n\nYou ramble on about many treasonous politicians \u2018on both sides\u2019. \n\nThe fact is: MTG called for an execution, \u2018because treason\u2019.

What are the chances Reps, who deny that Jan 6 was bad and call the violent riot \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d - are going to look out for the country over looking out for their criminal enterprise?",

When presenting evidence through discovery, both sides are to submit exhibits labeled by either a number or a letter. When trial testimony starts, counsel needs to give grounds as to why a certain exhibit should be entered into evidence.\n\nJust cuz a witness is being shown an exhibit, doesn't mean it's already entered as evidence. However, because the judge allowed counsel to read directly from the exhibit and had the witness use it for recall, I'm assuming it was entered as evidence prior to this line of questioning.\n\nOtherwise, as I said before, it would be hearsay.\n\nI see this is taking place in Atlanta (I think?). If this case is being ruled under state law and not federal law, her attorney could site Georgia Evidence code sec. 24-4-403 as to why admission of that article as evidence should be disallowed. Which I know only because it's word for word the exact same as CA evidence code sec. 352, and I work in legal in California.\n\nEdit: The judge overruled the defense's objection of relevance. Meaning it is relevant, but it still may not be admissible evidence. The line of questioning from counsel requires her recall from the exhibit, and then the judge rules \"asked and answered\", which means they are taking her answer of \"do you recall saying this?\" as \"yes\".\n\nNow that it's on record that she admits to it, it's no longer a question if it's relevant evidence. It's party admission now. So the guy got what he wanted from his cross.",

However, if she affirmed that she could not recall ever saying that, it would be hearsay and most likely disallowed as evidence until they could prove she was lying.    \n\n\nThe judge asked her directly if she recalls saying it. First she partially denies it, then partially admits it when the judge clarifies his question.   \n\n\nFirst she says: \"According to the CNN article I did, I dont remember...\"  \n\n\nJudge: \"Do you recall saying that?\"  \n\n\nGreene: \"I don't recall saying all of this, but \\*I DO RECALL HAVING SAID THIS\\*   \n about....\\[nonsensical and irrelevant\\]\"   \n\n\nHer saying \"...I do recall having said this...\" regardless of the bullshit context she put around it is enough to qualify as a party admission. Judge takes that as asked and answered so no need to worry about hearsay.   \n\n\nIf she continued just saying \"I dont remember\", it could be thrown out because then its hearsay. Even though we all know shes blatantly lying, they would have to prove that she's lying later on. I'm sure theres a video of her saying those words but they'd also have to examine the video for tampering and make sure its admissible under a bunch of other qualifying things.   \n\n\nThe guy crossing her got exactly what she wanted. She didnt want to lie to the judge's question and admitted it.",

Greene said this statement well before Jan 3rd.  \n\n\nSo yeah, state of mind/intent. And on the surface, you and I can agree it should get in as evidence pretty easily. But you go through enough witness testimony and have a skilled enough attorney, much more damning statements can be dismissed with enough reasoning.   \n\n\nIt could be ruled that her calling Pelosi a traitor does not have enough relevance to prove \"desire to engage in insurrection\". And you can see thats what Greene and her attorney were trying to do by claiming she only said those things because she disagrees with her politically.   \n\n\nIf the judge rules that statement as one made in the heat of the moment while disagreeing with policy and not relevant for that reason as well as being not within the date range in question, it could easily be thrown out.   \n\n\nThankfully this didnt happen, but Im just saying, hearsay can get really great and damning statements out very quickly if the judge doesnt buy it.",

                  "text": "Oh. man. these two fuckers, both boebert and majorie tayler green...If you're a lobbyist at the house of representatives you hear all sorts of shit about them but the general public doesn't hear about them since we generally don't talk to the press because it fucks up our relationships with lawmakers.\n\nI'll give this one story though.\n\nI'm Facebook's lobbyist and I need to lobby politicians FAST because of upcomming anti-Facebook legislation but we only manage to sway a handful of lawmakers because most of their constituents hate Facebook.\n\nAfter reporting my failures to Mark Zuckeburg he decided to come to DC to talk to politicians directly. But the only ones willing to meet with us are Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert. At the meeting Mark makes a passionate pitch, but when when we turn to MTG and LB, they look bored and deeply unimpressed. But then they eye each other, smile, and nod.\n\n\"Oh, we can get the republicans to help\" said one.\n\n\"But we need some 'help' from you first\", said the other.\n\nAnd they pass a note to Mark. I don't know how to describe the look that he gave when he was reading it, but for a second I panicked because I legitimacy thought he was going to throw up. He then told me I could leave now.\n\nI was surprised, but I knew better to ask questions, so I left.\n\nHalfway to my car I realize I was still holding Mark's very important notebook so I go back to return it and when I go into the meeting room, I see mark getting double cowgirled by them! They were high fiving and Mark noticed me and managed to push boebert's buttcheeks off his face to scream 'IT'S THE ONLY WAY' before she forcibly removed his hands, repositioning her butt back on his face with a loud fleshy slam with enough force to make me wince, followed by a fart which I could only assume was further punishment from Lauren.\n\nI got in my car. And drove. All the way back to Silicon Valley. I quit federal lobbying for good. I sent Mark my resignation. His only reply was a single word 'received'. I hoped to avoid seeing Mark because it was just too awkward for me. And I think he felt the same because he made no request to see me.\n\nI got a job as a state lobbyist for Cisco. I was in a much better place mentally and emotionally. State politics isn't as crazy as federal, and the capitol at Sacramento was only a 3 hour drive from my clients compared to the half a day travel going to DC.\n\nBut as someone who works in the tech lobbying world, it was only a matter of time before I run into him again, and that time came at the annual silicon valley big tech lobbying social. It's an opulent secret party in an isolated mansion in the Santa Cruz hills, where the top tech companies execs, politicians, and lobbyists meet to establish their secrets channels of favors.\n\nI noticed Mark and he seem to avoid me at first but them he came up to me with a nervous smile. \"I heard you saw my stunt double getting Eiffel towered by MTG and LB. I have a stunt double in DC btw\". And then he looked at me nervously, as if he was unsure if I would believe him. Did Mark think anyone would actually believe this?\n\nBut I humored him 'Oh yes. He looks exactly like you. I thought he was you tbh\". A big wave of relief spread through Mark's face and body.\n\nWe then caught up, and our conversation ended with a job offer to lobby for Facebook once again, at the state level, with a considerable pay increase from my current job.\n\nAround midnight the party was ending and people were starting to trickle out of the party, giddy at the new channels they established. 10 minutes into my drive I realize I left my coat. I go back to get it. By then the mansion was empty but all attendees are given a key card that lasts for 24 hours. I go to the coat room and open the door to find Mark getting double cowgirled by then senator Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi. Mark yells 'I'M THE STUNT DOUB' but I slammed the door before he could finish his sentence.\n\nI forfeited my coat, got in my car, and drove, non-stop, all the way to my hometown of Boulder Colorado. I arrive at my parents house, who were surprised to see me as I didn't tell them I was coming. I went directly to my old room, and slept, for 14 hours straight. When I woke up, I re-evaluated my life. I now work at a non-profit cancer research organization, and I am now at true peace, both emotionally and mentally.",

Ignorance is simply not knowing something, and every single individual on this planet is guilty of that - no one knows absolutely everything about everything.  I doubt most physics professors can compile their own operating systems and for the few of those that exist, I doubt they can rebuild an automatic transmission without a manual to show them how to do it.  Everyone is ignorant about some subject and there is no shame in that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStupidity is different.  I define that as \"ignorant and unwilling to even try to learn\", and that's what a lot of people are also guilty of.  I have no patience for those who are stupid about government when they aspire to an elected government office, and it absolutely should not be allowed to happen.  These are the individuals who write our laws, and many of them seem to have no grasp at all about how any of it works and they apparently don't give a single damn about learning how the process works either.  We have people that couldn't pass a 1970s high school civics class that are in congress right now, and that's just making a bad situation even worse.  I don't mean that they should all be lawyers, but they should at least have a very good understanding of how government works.  Senator Tuberville from Alabama can't even name the three branches of government - how the hell is he supposed to be an effective legislative member when his civics knowledge isn't as deep as a parking lot puddle?",

Every time it's obvious the lawyer is setting them up to say something that will hurt their case, and every time, instead of attempting to mitigate, or even just decline to answer, they declare \"yes I did the bad thing\" \n\nand the lawyer asks \"so you admit you did the bad thing? You know the bad thing was bad, right?\"\nAt which point they splutter and try to backpedal, which is hilarious to watch, because they are all pathologically incapable of admitting fault, so they have to try to say they didn't mean what they said without being able to say they didn't mean what they said.",

It would be nice to have a justice department that actually does the job as it was conceived.  Equally for everyone,  regardless of their income. The wider point would be dissonance between the intended role of institutions how they are applied. Sadly, there is a two - tier justice system and politicians and the wealthy never face justice ( at least, I haven't  seen that in my life -  time. It is a long discussion to have, but for various reasons the department  of justice can not hold everyone  in a position of power to a degree of responsibility they should be. But we should  strive for it and expect it from the people who supposed to be public servants. \n\nWhat I did not appreciate in the post you mention is the lazy, cynical 1984 reference, that equates  even the idea of department of justice with the Orwellian, authoritarian regime. This attributes not miscarriage of justice but malicious and deceiving intent to the institution.  Typical government = bad.  It reduces anything down to \" yeah but government, so corrupt  amirite? Taxation is theft!\" and so on.\n\nAnd I never get any sensible response from full - on libertarians. Because if we assume that any form of government what do we do?  No matter what we do, we will loop into some form of government, no matter what we call it.  \n\nPerhaps I did not word it in the most charitable way  I could in the other comment, but there. Hope it makes sense.",

I might see jail time, likely only for a few days though (then, you know, probation, community service etc)\n\nIt was the first time I've ever been to court and it was WILD. We had four completely random jurors just judging me based like 90% on mannerisms (and I'm a very nervous, awkward person). \n\nI honestly can't complain because my case was one where there just couldn't logically be much absolute evidence unless someone caught it on tape, and if that was necessary for every case, a huge portion of the law could never be exercised. \n\nBut like, the attorney and prosecutor were basically just... I don't know, gossiping. Trying to make me look bad, then the witness look bad. Not even unreliable so much as... dislikable lol. It was all just appeal to emotion. I really thought law was much more rigid and about appealing only to facts. \n\nBut yeah I don't know, I guess the facts did make me look pretty bad, there was a series of unfortunate coincidences. If I had been on that jury I may have convicted me, too. They deliberated for hours. It sucked though because I feel like with some juries I would have gotten a not guilty. It's just like... eh, what do you think, does she seem guilty? \n\nI'm a white blonde girl in a racist community. Had I been black I'm sure they wouldn't have deliberated for thirty seconds. However, I had been proven to be drunk at the time (I fully believe this is the only reason I was arrested and charged, even though being drunk itself is not a crime) and i live in a very heavily mormon community. It's difficult to overstate how incredibly taboo drinking here is. Mormonism RULES Utah and mormons never ever drink booze- i know a lot of religious people pretend not to drink but might have a glass of wine here and there. Mormons do not. Ever. And once they knkw youre not part of the cult, you are immediately An Outsider and untrustworthy. The fact that i am clearly a utah native raised mormon (you can tell by my accent, mannerisms, even facial features) actually probably made me look like a traitor and felt like betrayal because it was clear i had chosen to leave. It's stuff like this that makes it all so unfair and senseless. \n\nI really thought I'd get a not guilty because well I didn't do it but even if I had there was no solid evidence, so I thought it would just be thrown out before I even stood trial. I didn't know how law really worked.",

                                          "text": "So, it was a Friday night. \n\nApparently, a witness saw a white car (he kept emphasizing that he KNEW it was white) drive erratically, hit a parked black truck, then drive off. \n\nThere's a bar not even two blocks from my house. Some friends and I were down there and I admittedly got completely wasted. I walked home. \n\nI went downstairs, drunk af, got into my bed and before my drunk self could even shut my eyes, I heard POLICE!!!!!, dogs barking, panic. \n\nMy boyfriend (whom I live with) had been working upstairs on his laptop. He ran downstairs, confused, and took me upstairs. \n\nThere was so much confusion and I was so drunk and it's such a blur, but they took me to the police station and kept asking me if I had driven drunk. I told them, no, absolutely not, i havent driven since I came home from work at 5, but I'm definitely drunk (it was obvious anyway). They breathalyzed me, I was at .19 something. I'm a 115 pound woman, it doesn't take that much to get me wasted. \n\nThis of course elevated a hit and run into a DUI hit and run. \n\nIt was all very confusing but they let me go and my boyfriend picked me up from the station. I thought that was that. \n\nI was wrong. I was charged.\n\nSo, between the police report and the witness: \n\nLike I stated, the witness apparently was at a party nearby and stated he saw a white car hit a black car, then drive off. Apparently she was \"light orange haired, appeared to be in her 20s, and was wearing a flannel.\"\n\nHe said he then went inside his house to grab his cell phone. When he came out, he saw a similar woman (me) in the same general area stumbling into a nearby house.\n\nI have blonde hair, but it was the middle of the night and I can see how that might be confused. I don't own a flannel. I was wearing a black shirt. But there's no real way to prove that to the court. \n\nSo, parking in my neighborhood is really difficult and annoying and i had indeed (after work, sober, hours before this happened!) parked just down the street in the same direction the witness claimed he saw the woman drive. Honestly, kinda my bad for parking there but it's not blocking anyone's house and I've been doing so for over 2 years and nobody's complained. \n\nWhat was unbelievable though and I thought would save me... MY CAR IS GOLD. Yeah, so again, this happened just at the start of COVID, just over 2 years ago (trials were delayed), so I guess you could argue gold might look like white at night and memory might fail you. But he was adamant. \n\nBut the prosecutor showed images of the damage as evidence... \n\nTHE PAINT LEFT ON THE BLACK TRUCK WAS WHITE!! \n\nMy car is one I inherited from my older brother once he could afford a new one. It has some dents, they took a pic of the ones on the front right, but none of course had a trace of black paint. My dad owns a used car business and originally gave this car to my brother; he's been in it his entire life, starting as a mechanic, and he's now in his early 60s. During lunch, he agreed with me this made no sense. At first he was very skeptical of me but this made him like... okay hon, you're telling the truth. There would be paint left on both of those cars.\n\nThe prosecutor just boldly insisted that paint doesn't always leave residue in collisions. That's a hell of an assumption to claim to begin with, but the fact that it DID have white residue, which coincided with the testimony that it was a white car?! \n\nAlso, did I mention my keys were hung up in a separate room in our basement where I keep them the entire time? I feel like that should have indicated I hadn't driven in a while. \n\nMy attorney was brilliant at pointing out the logical inconsistencies, but I just don't think he was speaking quite as definitively as the prosecutor. When I talk about how it turned into \"gossip,\" well... \n\nAt one point, my attorney was essentially just like, \"You seem like you really want this to be true, and her to be convicted. Is there any reason why?\" (I'm of course paraphrasing haha.) \n\nI'm still not sure if my attorney had known this beforehand, but the witness eventually admitted that his older brother was a DUI cop (you probably know the actual name; I don't, but I know he's a cop who specializes in DUIs). He said he does ride alongs all of the time with him and aspires to be one!! \n\nI... okay I'm sorry but it's very obvious why this guy pointed at the first woman who had lightish hair and was walking home. \n\nThis will greatly compromise my career prospects and honestly feels unjust. \n\nBoth attorneys were speaking very quickly and I kind of think the jurors didn't catch all the facts and were going off of gut. They were likely exhausted and not really keeping track of every contradictory detail in their minds.",

Green (R-Moscow) didn\u2019t remember any of the many times she called Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, et cetera \u201ctraitors\u201d, her lawyers knew there was video in evidence of her doing exactly that. My guess is that she\u2019s so used to telling bald-faced lies that she forgot that lying under oath is a felony. In Georgia, perjury carries a prison sentence of 1-10 years.\n\nIt\u2019s hugely telling that MTG claims she doesn\u2019t remember anything she said, saw, or did while participating in one of the most important events in American history. If she really doesn\u2019t remember anything that happened on January 6th 2021 that\u2019s prima facia evidence that she is medically unfit into hold office.",

                  "text": "I don\u2019t know anything about a stenomasks per-se but my mom was a court stenographer for 30+ years. I could listen to her at home reading back her steno notes to voice recordings and it is incredibly detailed stuff. Every paragraph return is explicitly stated along with every comma or punctuation mark. Even who is talking. This would be my assumption for why there is a voice stenographer over or along with a recording. A recording doesn\u2019t give you a transcript. Even if there was a speech to text to go along with the recording it would just be one huge word brick with no discernment for who is talking or breaking out paragraphs. So the voice stenographer in this clip might be saying something like: \n\nDefendant colon quote no i didnt say that end quote state colon quote let me show you exibit a end quote paragraph quote the court colon lets take a five minute break. \n\nThe result when speaking into a dictation software is a transcript:\n\nDefendant: \u201cNo I didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\nState: \u201cLet me show you exhibit A.\u201d\n\nCourt: \u201cLet\u2019s take a five minute break.\u201d\n\nThis takes a lot of practice and I used to ask my mom how she was able to type in shorthand so quickly while listening to a conversation or even a debate back-and-forth between multiple people. She said it just took a lot of practice and you really had to get in the right frame of mind to do it each day. I always equated it to getting really good at playing an instrument where it doesn\u2019t seem so much like work anymore as it is second nature or just very fluid and natural.\n\nFun fact: steno machines now are much better. Even the manual ones where you type, which are the most common. They have a digital feed and can do much of the transcription for you. The way my mom used to do it was with a steno machine writing to short hand on long thin paper that looked like accounting paper. If you couldn\u2019t read the short hand it just looked like random letters on a weird sheet of paper. You couldn\u2019t read it unless you knew how to. She would then bring that paper home to a reel tape dictation recorder and read it like I described above in excruciating detail. Once she had the short hand into a voice recording she could then play the voice recording and begin typing it out with a typewriter. Once there was a typed transcript, that would be filed. So the stenography part was just part of the job.\n\nedit: I\u2019m glad so many have enjoyed the explanation. Thanks for the awards. Have a great weekend everyone.",

They're just broadcasting exactly what is happening, there's no journalism going on, no interpretation, no commentary, no explanation. It's just an unfiltered feed of video and audio of the proceedings with a minimal amount of editing to cut back and forth between different speakers and some on-screen graphics to inform the viewer who's speaking.\n\n\"The press\" operates very differently to that, wouldn't you say? Pundits, talking heads, editorial opinion pieces, news coverage that puts events into context, interviews, reporters, vox-pops, investigative journalism, advertising...\n\nI'd say CSPAN is more akin to publicly available CCTV than it is the press.",

Or maybe your belief that \"We the People\" can do anything about it. \"We the People\" includes plenty of bigots, idiots, and assholes that are happy with her in power, and happy with at least some of the status quo (the authoritarian parts). If you think a populist uprising is necessary, it seems to me their side is going to be willing to be a lot more violent and brutal than yours. Which is besides the fact that the corrupt establishment has a stranglehold on the United States - what was the percent of policy and legislative actions that align with donor interests in lieu of the public? 90%? I don't mean to sound cynical, but the United States Supreme Court legalized bribery of elected officials - the corruption is out in the open. So ya, the MTGs and Trumps are frustrating to me, but they're just an externality of decades of polarized politics and anti-intellectual fearmongering deliberately designed to disenfranchise and disengage voters.",

First of all, I was not talking about people that voted for her in 2020 - I was talking about people that look at her and her conduct in office and think she is clever. In an average of three polls last year she got a 15% favorable rating from Americans, with two of the polls including American adults in general and one focusing only on registered voters. Either way that represents millions of Americans that are happy with her conduct. To be fair, we don't know they all also think she's smart - I was speaking hyperbolically to emphasize how sad I think it is that \\*anyone\\* thinks she's smart - but it's quite clear at least that she has the support of millions of Americans.",

All I said is that millions of Americans look at her and think she's clever, and are glad she represents them. To be fair,  I was exaggerating for effect - certainly a subset of people that polled favorable are in her camp because their whole identity is trolling libs, and another subset supports her because she is cover for  corruption. What we cannot know for certain is how many fall into which camp, but however many do think she is clever - that is sad.

Keep in mind I did not say the tell was about her lying.  I said blink rate is an indicator of nervousness, and the research supports that.    \n\n\n\"Everyone\" doesn't react differently.  There are patterns exhibited from the way we're built cognitively that allow us to form predictive associations.  There are also outliers, people who do not follow those patterns.  It's important to keep that in mind, and I do my best to do so.\n\nWe're not talking here about a poker tell, like scratching your nose when you've got a shit hand.  We're talking about autonomic responses that happen in response to threat perception pretty consistently in humans.\n\nAfter I connected blinking to nervousness, I said she's lying because she literally just lied.  She stated that she didn't say it, then the lawyer introduced the exhibit, and she totally backtracked.  There's no extrapolation there.  She lied.  Seems like a reasonable connection between A and B in this case, but maybe I'm being unfair.  I'll reflect further.",

She won the race as soon as she won the republican primary. She is there because people in her district want her there. She may be  a bat shit, insane, racist, homophobic, antisemitic, anti intellectual dumb ass that probably should be DQ'd from running. But that's just a representative of her district (sorry to the sane people there that didn't vote for her).",

Looking at the fresh stock of their fellow party representatives (their own replacements) wondering if perhaps they have made a mistake. Thinking that maybe they pushed it too far. However, it is too late to remedy. The machine must continue to operate. If they pause to look back, or attempt a repair, then they will lose what precious ground they've gained.\n\nThis of course leading to the ultimate demise of the Republican party.

In reality genuinely forgetting and intentionally lying but pretending to forget can be indistinguishable without evidence that you knew the truth the whole time.\n\nIt's obvious to anyone with half a mind that she intentionally lied in this scenario but that's only due to the context and what we know about her. And this is a court of law and not a court of common sense. \n\nThe bottom line is perjury is meant to be a difficult charge to nail someone on, and giving witnesses the benefit of the doubt is important because people are stupid and they do forget things enough that otherwise we'd be throwing people in jail for giving bad testimony every day.",

I've since dedicated myself to learning and trying to understand things better.

Since both political parties had already fallen under the control of the wealthy (thanks, Reagan) the resulting gutting of public infrastructure and programs went largely unopposed. We have finally reached a point where the neglect can\u2019t be ignored by the public, so the GOP, and it\u2019s many tentacled network of dark money, seeks to channel folks\u2019 anger against LGBT+ or immigrants or abortions or whatever gets the most attention. Their tactics at this point are antagonize, sabotage, demonize. And it is depressingly effective. They\u2019ve managed to even counter being called out on it; anyone who points out what they\u2019re doing is \u201cpart of the woke mob trying to cancel me\u201d, they have co-opted language of the oppressed and use it to rally their base. \n\nFrankly, I think they should be purged from the country\u2019s political system. Many would call that extreme, but I think continuing to let them openly sabotage our country would itself be a fatal mistake.",

Does this automatically prove that in this particular case, racism is involved? No. The original comment did not specify that either. The comment was alluding to the proof that disenfranchised minorities are more likely to face harsh penalties than white millionaires, this statement is based on the information I just provided. So based on this fact, it's a reasonable assumption to say there is a different legal system in America for white millionaires. Hope this helps you.",

I've laid it for you, you may not believe there's a disportionate number of poor minorities in prison, but the numbers are fairly clear. This requires some deduction you are refusing to engage in, which is perfectly fine and your right. To be clear, the deduction is that MGT is getting a pass because statistically poor minorities are more likely to be imprisoned. Considering she's a white millionaire, it's reasonable to assume she won't face the same consequences as a poor minority, just strictly based in the numbers I have happily provided you via the link. \n\nIts ok if you don't agree. Maybe you think this is an outlier. Maybe it is. You wanted facts and I've provided it you. I can't make you believe it though, at the end of the day who really give af.

If Republicans get their way, make no mistake, they want the U.S. to be exactly like Nazi Germany. They hide behind things like innuendo and rhetoric, but that's their ultimate goal. Which is why they're always crying about things like \"White-replacement\" and \"Reversed-racism\". A recent poll I read said 30% of republicans think equal rights has gone too far and 70% say things like racism towards minorities isn't real. These are the same folks who absent any proof at all still say the election was stolen. 80% of republicans now believe it was stolen. And more than 50% support using violence to further their goals. \n\nAnd all over the planet, Democracy seems to be in trouble, with the rise of autocracies, and even there, people polled said they prefer authoritarian rule over Democracy. They love people like Putin, Duterte, Assad, Jinping, Kim, and Trump. That's some scary shit.",

Or maybe just maybe are you looking at it from a lens based on the preexisting ideas you have based on a minority of the group?\n\nBecause it's very easy to group people up in one profile and say fuck X group they believe in XYZ all of them because they identify with that group so they're immoral.\n\nWell that's like saying liberals are all commie pieces of garbage who enjoy wasting money on useless policies that don't work and encourage people to not work, alongside trying to force diversity to the point that people are chosen for a roll in a company based on the color of their skin rather than based on their work and experience which again is judging someone by the color of their skin rather than the contents of their character.\n\nIs this an accurate assessment of the entire liberal ideology? Absolutely not.\n\nPeople have different ideas, they may identify with an ideology because there's 2 ideologies in the states maybe 3 if you want to consider libertarianism as well but that doesn't mean you agree with everything that different parts of the group believe in.\n\nNot every democrat is a communist, not every republican is a racist.\n\nAre there issues? Fuck yes there are issues welcome to having only 2 parties in the USA when you have a binary system prepare yourself for a shit show and since you support one side and demonize the opposition you're directly aiding the divide between Americans congratulations you got played by both main parties.\n\nSeriously you're part of the massive group of Americans who are blind to the truth that you're just toys, they want to keep you on opposite sides doing the dirty work for your own party while people who don't agree with you get pissed off as well and demonize you it's a vicious cycle.\n\nI have a problem with the people who are too self-centered to realize that their party and ideology isn't always correct and that you can agree with points of both sides but for that you need to stop for a second and see others as people rather than your damn enemy they just don't agree with every single point you believe in, welcome to living in a society everyone has their own ideas but you won't get anywhere as long as you keep demonizing others.",

The poster is defending conservatism which is inself indefensible because of its baseline ideals of upholding the status quo.

If this is sounding scarily like captialism to you you wouldn't be the first to realize that. Conversatism at it's absolute best is still not worth the harm it does to any one individual. There is no argument because this person is basing their entire thought process off the statement \"normal conservatives\" when in fact there are none. And thirty more paragraphs of waffling around his original point doesn't come off as a good argument it comes off as someone that has never been marginalized never been let down by the system a child that can't accept that they may be wrong or that no is the answer.  \n\nThe only rebuttal needed here is please reconsider your stance because by believing that there are kind conservatives \"somewhere\"  that wouldn't jump to support someone like Greene if given the chance you are doing yourself and the disadvantaged marginalized people that you claim to care for a disservice.",

This both sides are different but equal argument is so banal not worth the data used to send the text. Everyone in America knows the party system has issues but if you can sit here and tell me a group of people agree that they should have control of someone else's legal autonomy in any regard but they're not so bad if you get to know them, then you've lost me. I don't think you know what individualism is honestly you can be free to be your own person but also contribute to a community and society as a whole.\n\nIf someone is an asshole and has hateful ideals that could hurt others you have every right as an American to dislike and disagree with that person. Stop getting so theater with the demonizing bullshit. You're no better than the people standing on either side of the fence when all you do is stand in the middle and tell them to get along.",

So conservative. Family values. So fiscal. How could *anyone* be against that?\n\nI bet you vote R or whatever the other \"don't tread on me\" party is, no matter policy. That's the problem. Democrats and green actually hold some good policy and have grass roots donations but idiots won't vote that way because they need to be one party or the other. This country is doomed because of the absolute ignorance and disregard of solid policy. Clinton was a policy wonk that had her hand on what this country needed and actually thought about those needs, but we got an absolute moron instead. It's Idiocracy.",

Let's widen the lens to illustrate my point. I am looking at a video of MTG, an ELECTED official, behaving like an oaf. I can find videos of her doing this stuff easily. As it stands right now, Americans have become the GQP whether they admit it or not. The sheer fact that people like MTG are in government, along with many other lunatics like her, is proof that the American people won't vote her out. This is just who Americans are.\n\nNow you might say \"oh but there are republicans and democrats. The democrats don't support this.\" But I say no. There are Americans.

He also put in Sandra Day O'Conner who refused to condemn Roe vs Wade and became more moderate over time. I am sure they love his memory, but he was nothing like Bush Jr., Trump, Abbot, or Desantos. \n\nIf Reagan came back in another name right now do you think he would beat Trump?

Use some not-quite-truth-but-close variation of the truth that incites more of an emotional response than the actual truth. \n\n2. Provide a source that *almost* verifies the claim, but not quite. You want the difference to be close enough that people will fall prey to their own implicit biases/preferences but not so far off that it can be easily disproven. People who are already of the opinion already won't bother verifying and people on the fence may not catch it either. The latter being the primary goal.\n\n3. Repeat ad nauseam or until social unrest. \n\nEventually you end up with two groups that are literally talking different languages. Particular words to group 1 mean completely different things to group 2. \n\nE.G.- Critical race theory, BLM, Occupy, lgbtq rights, etc etc etc.\n\nWorth noting that she clearly made it pretty easy to make herself look dumb here though.",

Lots of courtroom and deposition testimony has been lost due to malfunctioning equipment.  A live reporter can still be recording testimony even if the electricity goes out; a machine can't do that as 99% of all recording programs are run by electricity, not batteries, for long daily use.  \n\u2022A live human being can clarify words that are slurred, garbled, mumbled, or otherwise unintelligible.  A machine can't alert you that something wasn't understandable.  \n\n\nBottom line, if you've ever compared a transcript done by a transcriptionist after an AI recording versus a transcript done by a stenographer after being there in person, you'll know the live human being wins, hands down.

I think it's less she is an idiot and moreso she knows exactly who got her elected and what they want from her - a calculated tactic making her so much more insidious than just an attention-seeking loon. \n\nShe is a disciple of Trump's playbook. Never admit a mistake, never apologize, and the truth becomes what gets said the most. So say the same thing loud enough and bombastically enough, drowning out (or suing) anyone who dares contradict, and eventually you control the narrative (\"I am a great and successful businessman\"). Trump is the master at it, with 40 years experience at exactly this, and everyone of the tag-along GOP fringe candidates who has tried to play this has come off ham-fisted  and remarkably lacking in self-awareness. But Trump is wildly popular in her district, and she is seen as a martyr to the liberal elites. It's very possible she will be re-elected, even though she has been removed from every committee and is essentially a wasted candidate.",

      "text": "This quotation of Dietrech Boenhoeffer perfeclt captures the past several years in American politics:\n\n\"Stupidity is a more dangerous enemy of the good than malice. One may protest against evil; it can be exposed and, if need be, prevented by use of force. Evil always carries within itself the germ of its own subversion in that it leaves behind in human beings at least a sense of unease. Against stupidity we are defenseless. Neither protests nor the use of force accomplish anything here; reasons fall on deaf ears; facts that contradict one\u2019s prejudgment simply need not be believed- in such moments the stupid person even becomes critical \u2013 and when facts are irrefutable they are just pushed aside as inconsequential, as incidental. In all this the stupid person, in contrast to the malicious one, is utterly self-satisfied and, being easily irritated, becomes dangerous by going on the attack. For that reason, greater caution is called for than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018If we want to know how to get the better of stupidity, we must seek to understand its nature. This much is certain, that it is in essence not an intellectual defect but a human one. There are human beings who are of remarkably agile intellect yet stupid, and others who are intellectually quite dull yet anything but stupid. We discover this to our surprise in particular situations. \r  \n\r  \nThe impression one gains is not so much that stupidity is a congenital defect, but that, under certain circumstances, people are made stupid or that they allow this to happen to them. We note further that people who have isolated themselves from others or who live in solitude manifest this defect less frequently than individuals or groups of people inclined or condemned to sociability. And so it would seem that stupidity is perhaps less a psychological than a sociological problem. \r  \n\r  \nIt is a particular form of the impact of historical circumstances on human beings, a psychological concomitant of certain external conditions. Upon closer observation, it becomes apparent that every strong upsurge of power in the public sphere, be it of a political or of a religious nature, infects a large part of humankind with stupidity. It would even seem that this is virtually a sociological-psychological law. The power of the one needs the stupidity of the other. \r  \n\r  \nThe process at work here is not that particular human capacities, for instance, the intellect, suddenly atrophy or fail. Instead, it seems that under the overwhelming impact of rising power, humans are deprived of their inner independence, and, more or less consciously, give up establishing an autonomous position toward the emerging circumstances. The fact that the stupid person is often stubborn must not blind us to the fact that he is not independent. In conversation with him, one virtually feels that one is dealing not at all with a person, but with slogans, catchwords and the like that have taken possession of him. He is under a spell, blinded, misused, and abused in his very being. Having thus become a mindless tool, the stupid person will also be capable of any evil and at the same time incapable of seeing that it is evil. This is where the danger of diabolical misuse lurks, for it is this that can once and for all destroy human beings.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018Yet at this very point it becomes quite clear that only an act of liberation, not instruction, can overcome stupidity. Here we must come to terms with the fact that in most cases a genuine internal liberation becomes possible only when external liberation has preceded it. Until then we must abandon all attempts to convince the stupid person. This state of affairs explains why in such circumstances our attempts to know what \u2018the people\u2019 really think are in vain and why, under these circumstances, this question is so irrelevant for the person who is thinking and acting responsibly. The word of the Bible that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom declares that the internal liberation of human beings to live the responsible life before God is the only genuine way to overcome stupidity.\r  \n\r  \n\u2018But these thoughts about stupidity also offer consolation in that they utterly forbid us to consider the majority of people to be stupid in every circumstance. It really will depend on whether those in power expect more from people\u2019s stupidity than from their inner independence and wisdom.\u2019\r  \n\r  \n\\-Dietrich Bonhoeffer, from \u2018After Ten Years\u2019 in Letters and Papers from Prison (Dietrich Bonhoeffer Works/English, vol. 8) Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 2010.",

This whole \"regular person\" thing is a right-wing fever dream.  \"come off the farm and served for a few years before going back\" has never happened with any regularity in the history of humanity.  The house of representatives is the only place that's really happened, and it's someone like Cori Bush, who's an idiot.\n\nEvery argument for term limits is really a compensation for big money in politics. If 80 year olds shouldn't be making laws, they wouldn't get elected.  If you're arguing how they get elected, your probably arguing about campaign financing.\n\nIn actual practice, term limits just transfer power to lobbyists.",

All conditions wished upon conservatives by liberal Democrats, famous and ordinary, trained to hate by political leaders who blame Trump for the ills of the world while themselves obtusely accusing him of hate and death\u201d. \n\n#THEY ARE ALL EVIL\n\nNot to mention Schumer did threaten 2 SCOTUS by saying, \u201cYou have released the whirlwind, and you will pay the price.

Guessing he doesn\u2019t randomly break into a sweat wearing a suit.  More importantly he looks capable of still being able to see his own dick so I\u2019m guessing he is also capable of giving it a good washing.  \n\nTrump on the other hand is fairly fat and in poor physical shape. Guessing he gets those fat guy sweats quite often and has trouble seeing his dick making it difficult to give it a good wash.  Throw in the tanning oil/spray mixed with the sweat and unwashed taint you got a pretty nasty mix on your hands down there.  My understanding is that Melania chooses not to share a bed with the Donald anymore so clearly he\u2019s got some funk about him.",

You liberal democrats got what you wanted right, Child abductions and human trafficking is up, crime has skyrocketed in every city that defunded their police, gas is ridiculously high, thousands of illegals and criminals poured across the border, country is good n fucked up just like yall wanted.

This is why questions are typically answered as either yes or no in legal proceedings. The post and video are misleading viewers by omitting the alleged evidence proving that she said \u201cNancy Pelosi is a traitor\u201d and labeling the video with a conclusive statement. The video is leading the viewer to come to a particular conclusion without any evidence by manipulating very specific video snippets. That\u2019s extremely bias. I don\u2019t know anything about the circumstances surrounding the video and what\u2019s going on in it so from my perspective the person who posted this video seems to be purposely foregoing their due diligence to convey the facts.",
