Having said that, I think you are living in basically a feminist bubble. And a very small, western bubble at that. So, allow me to educate you. Western women are probably the most privileged group on the planet. Far more than western men. Not saying this was always the case. In fact, I would say this has been the case for maybe a couple of decades. \n\n> Feminism is about taking one step at a time.\n\nFeminism in this day and age, particularly in the West, has proven to be nothing more than a path toward female superiority and the vilification of men. It is also clearly about self aggrandizing rather than giving a voice to the voiceless, i.e. the marginalized. Feminism during the first, second and to some extent, the third wave, had clear and noble goals, which centered around establishing an egalitarian society. None of that is a hallmark of feminism today! \n\n> If you really do care about gender equality in middle eastern countries, please help spread awareness about it.\n\nSo, I assume you don't?",

It has to be an us versus them kind of thing, because that is the only solution they will respond to. It's not like I like war, or the idea of burying millions. Makes me sick to my bones, but it's the only way manhood and masculinity comes out of this standing. All other avenues have been explored, and have been dead-ends. Going our own way, did not work. Reasoning with them, has not worked. Sometimes, when the cancer is too persistent, you cut off that diseased limb, and engineer your children to never face such again.\n\nDrastic, yes. Extreme, yes.

They have already made up their mind about men, we have a penis and balls, or maybe not depending on your viewpoint, but we are men and by nature of being men we are warmongers and rapists and no amount of truth or facts will change their views, that they benefit from and openly enjoy benevolent sexism and do not see the hypocrisy is irrelevant. \n\nIt's not them who we need to change but those who's views are open to change, that is usually those who are listening, undecided, that's where good women speaking up can make the difference because try as we might speaking up does nothing but get us shut down.\n\nThe end result though is always going to be a race to the bottom, too many women enjoy men and enjoy the collective of feminism, too many enjoy the benefits of benevolent sexism and enjoy the sense of belonging to a group calling themselves feminists who will not speak up but at the same time will claim they actually don't hate men. \n\nThen of course there are the women who don't hate men just some of the things some men do, goes the same for some women, they will not speak up because they believe their views are irrelevant, inconsequential and don't want to face the accusations of being a pick me.\n\nEventually the squeaky wheel gets the grease and these women will lose out, data shows its already begun to happen and will get worse, when it crosses that tipping point who will they have to blame, you guessed it.",
