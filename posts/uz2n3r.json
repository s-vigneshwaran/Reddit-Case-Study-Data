  "text": "TIFU: by thinking peanut butter was supposed to be spicy\nObligatory: this happened a few months back.\n\nEver since I was a kid I loved how peanut butter used to taste. Not only did it taste good, but it had this weird \"spice,\" to it that wasn't like a chili pepper type spice, but wholly unique that I never tasted in other foods. It was the perfect accent when mixed with jelly, as the spiciness and the sweetness went together perfectly. Sometimes I'd \"eat too fast,\" and have a bit of a hard time breathing, but I never thought anything of it. I also remember getting some weird looks a few times as a kid talking about spicy peanut butter, but didn't think anything of that either.\n\nOne day a few months ago, I (25m) was staying at my parents house and went to make myself some lunch. I saw some peanut butter in the pantry, but no jelly so since I was hungry I slammed about an inch of peanut butter between two slices of bread and remember thinking \"wow, this is the most peanut butter I've ever eaten at once,\" but then got to work devouring my creation.\n\nThis is where the fuckup starts. A few bites in I got that \"ate too fast,\" feeling again and had to take a break to catch my breath. I started eating again and immediately got the ate-too-fast feeling again. *Damn, it's going to take me forever to eat this sandwich* I thought, so I became determined to just power through and finish it no matter how uncomfortable it was. Big Mistake.\n\nI made it to about the half way point before I knew something was wrong. It felt simultaneously like there was a rock stuck in my windpipe and like somebody had filled my lungs with peanut butter. Weezing and struggling to breath, it fucking *hurt*. The amount of time it took to take a full breath was causing me to panic and felt like I was trying to fill up a hot air balloon with a straw. I immediately started googling \"heart attack symptoms,\" but they didn't really match up. I then googled the symptoms themselves and results of \"symptoms of allergic reactions,\" started coming up. Some of the main symptoms were difficulty breathing, chest tightness, and wheezing. Then I scrolled further down and saw a section about \"things to watch out for in children,\" and the top one was... the child says their \"mouth feels hot,\" or that they say non-spicy food is spicy.\n\nAfter a painfully long period of time I started being able to breath again and suddenly all the weird looks I got from talking about spicy peanut butter made sense! Peanut butter wasn't spicy, I'd just been poisoning myself all these years! I now use peanut butter alternatives and mix my jelly with \"sweet Asian chili jelly,\" I pick up from the store and it's just as good, but doesn't almost kill me.\n\nTLDR: I thought peanut butter was supposed to taste spicy, turns out I'm just an idiot and allergic to it.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards! Also glad I could help some people realize the signs of allergies. \n\nEDIT 2: A lot of people were asking why I didn't immediately call an ambulance. Remember, this was something that happened all the time and I thought was normal, so it took about 30 seconds of me waiting for it to go away, then realizing it wasn't and drinking some water (40-120 seconds now), before I even went to get my phone. By this point it had actually started to get better (slowly, but noticeably) so I knew I was in the clear. This is why I googled 'heart attack,\" as it was my understanding that some of those symptoms can be transient.",

It was all things we encounter like cats, dust mites, grass, trees, etc. But at my follow up appointment I may ask if they can do something else. Because the more I think about it, the more it seems like my reaction to honey was more of an allergic reaction than it was a sensitivity. Maybe I should present it a little bit stronger than I did before. I guess it\u2019s possible that she didn\u2019t fully understand what I was saying about my reactions. I did go into details about other issues that I have had with food but those issues tend to be stomach related which she said is not going to produce anaphylactic responses generally. But if I focus on the things that make my throat burn, maybe she would understand that as an actual allergy and test for it. And if all else fails I\u2019ll just cut myself and put some honey in it as you say haha",

It's caused by an enzyme, I think bromelain, that dissolves the protective mucous in our mouths, letting the acidic fruit eat away at your tongue and gums. Canned pineapple has much less bromelain because the canning process destroys it. So if it still tingles when you eat canned pineapple, you're probably allergic.\n\nPS- bromelain is very anti-inflammatory and of you drink a gallon of pineapple juice the day before a surgery, like wisdom teeth removal, you can have a much faster recovery. I had my son try it for his wisdom teeth removal and he was basically healed up in three days.",

This is info I used to know, but have forgotten, but sure Google can help better than I. \ud83d\ude05 Stay safe!\n\nEdit: Fine, I googled. Latex-fruit syndrome. There's a bunch of fruit and veg that contain the same proteins as latex, so latex allergies tend to cross over with these. I get the tinglies from strawberry and kiwi, more kiwi, so assume there's something slight there, but avoided them for a long time now, just in case / not a big fruit eater anyways. \ud83d\ude02",

I don't know if it's me or if a manufacturer changes their formula... for the longest time, only Wal-greens store brand fabric bandaids didn't react, and every single Band-aid brand did. Now, I can't use the fabric ones, but the expensive new Band-aid flex something or others don't give me a reaction. Got blood drawn last month, they used paper tape over a cotton ball: huge reaction inside my elbow, skin went all scaly and peely once the welt went away. Got a cheap plastic bandage at a first aid stand in the park when I scratched my leg slipping of a rock: no reaction. I once got a sewing machine needle through my thumb (just through the skin to the side of my nail) - too longer for the bandage reaction to heal than the puncture (got to get a tetanus shot, too!).",

Sometimes she would eat a grape and have an allergic reaction and sometimes she would eat a grape and she wouldn\u2019t have a reaction. Idk, might be related might not be but couldn\u2019t hurt to look into it. People who have this condition typically have a hard time pinpointing their allergies",

I totally get having an initial response and if you can smell it I get having a negative effect but beyond that they need to get over themselves.

Milk on the scale of foods people find odd has some basis for himself but in general a strong distaste for a food seems to either mean and allergy or a possible gut biome issue. If their body has trouble digesting a food your body will usually start giving you weird vibes about that food and lots of people have trouble with lactose so it makes sense on a biological level. Not saying his issue is definitely chemical in nature but sometimes realizing the reason we take issues (like disgust towards milk) is subconscious and if we recognize the mechanics going on sometimes its easier to get past a hangup.",

Not to get all \u201cOh that\u2019s a red flag!\u201d at the drop of a hat like half of Reddit, but I\u2019ve learned to be wary of people who habitually insist that other people\u2019s experiences/tastes/neurological configuration must mirror their own, and if not, it\u2019s because those people are \u201ccrazy\u201d or \u201clooking for attention\u201d. \n\nEven when it\u2019s something small \u2014 in fact, _especially_ when it\u2019s small \u2014 I think an inability to believe that other people\u2019s tastes and experiences are terribly different from your own is, at the very least, a barrier against having fully three dimensional and healthy connections with people. The best people I know are _fascinated_ by the subjective, interior experience of others, and put creative, enthusiastic energy into \u201cemulating others\u2019 brains\u201d to better bridge the gap between themselves and others, instead of just assuming \u201ceveryone is just like me, with different skin\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s something everyone _thinks_ they\u2019re good at. But in practice, it\u2019s a rare and wonderful \u201cmental muscle\u201d to develop. \n\nFun real world example: Supposedly, Fred Rogers was notoriously \u201c[the hardest interview subject on television] (https://youtu.be/z966lQ4KZwc),\u201d because he would invariably turn the conversation around on you, and get even the most professional journalists talking about themselves.",

Then our brains are wizards and will convince us it was a conscious choice form the start.  \n\n\nNot to say the vegan aspect can't happen, maybe he is really pro cows, and that makes sense, but the \"adult\" part is what makes me think it may have more to do with his gut biome than he realizes. Lot's of people instinctively do things then rationalize it after the fact. That was what I mean by knowing the behind the scenes sometimes helps us move past things. IF all he can see is \"milk in adulthood is iccccky\" then there is no room to unravel that but if he starts going \"oh hmm... maybe the reason I feel this way is the thought of drinking milk makes me feel like my stomachs upset and maybe that's because when I had drank milk in the past it upset my stomached and my brain never forgot deep down but on the surface, I forgot. So now, when I see milk, it makes me feel disgust\" and the conscious brain goes \"yeah, obviously it's disgusting, I mean, look at it! It's milk, isn't it obvious?\" Not realizing a surprising amount of things that are \"obvious\" only seem that way due to natural instincts making them obvious (don't quote me on the surprising amount, I am not an expert, I know it accounts for lots more than zero, so give this to me please lol).  \n\n\nSo, it still may be the case, he just doesn't think of it that way. Again, this isn't by any means the only thing ever and it doesn't by any means account for every food aversion. I do know lots of people dislike foods they are allergic to long before realizing they are allergic to them. Like I never cared for tree nuts really, they taste like nothing to me. I can taste nutty, especially because peanuts are fine for me, but whenever I ate almonds as a kid, they had literally zero taste besides the salty. It's likely my allergy is related to the lack of tasting anything from them and I never liked them much growing up. My allergy only hit me when I was 25, and it was after eating 5 pound tins of cashews for a while (I get some flavor form cashews, and it was like $15 for a 5 pound tin and they are healthy so I ate a bunch. Eventually I developed the rash this thread is about (the burning eventually becomes a rash if you just keep doing it like it seems a ton of people, me including, did.) I thought I must have cancer because I had never been allergic to anything that I knew of previously. Finally before calling the doctor and telling them I was going to die I decided to give the 3rd, \"dumb\" option a try, stop eating the cashews (the rash was itchy so I would chew them up and use them to itch the roof of my mouth... yeah... didn't help, but felt amazing). And the rash that had been developing slowly for weeks, went away overnight.   \n\n\nSorry, that was a lot.",

                  "text": "My beloved mother is allergic to coconut. She was sick last year because of a mystery condition that causes her body to just lose sodium. We still don\u2019t know why but mostly manage it with daily sodium pills, but she was trying to find water alternatives with some sodium in them to help balance things early on, while we were still operating under the assumption that this was a \u201cnormal\u201d low sodium issue. So she was trying sports drinks and electrolyte mixes and such. \n\nSomeone brought her some Body Armor, and she *loved* it. I had never paid attention to it so I was just like cool we found something she can drink that will replace at least some of the sodium. Awesome. Then she asked me to get her some more when I went to the store. \n\nThere I am happily getting a variety of bottles off the shelf when my eye catches on the \u201cmade with coconut water\u201d and I think \u201cohhh not that one\u2026 better check the others.\u201d\n\nYeah. All of them. So I took a quick snap of the label and sent it to mom and said \u201cI love you and I want you to be happy but I am NOT buying you death juice, and also this probably explains the mild shortness of breath you\u2019ve been having that you were going to ask the doc about at your follow up.\u201d\n\nShe was very sad. Also very happy that she didn\u2019t go into anaphylaxis and die thirty minutes from everyone. I also texted my oldest nephew to let him know because he was doing grocery runs sometimes too, and one of the symptoms of low sodium is cognitive problems\u2026 I didn\u2019t want mom to forget that it was poison and ask him to get it for her instead! \n\n*That* conversation went a little something like this:\n\n\u201cHey, Nephew, I just figured out that Body Armor is made with coconut water, so if grandma forgets and asks you to get some, don\u2019t \ud83d\ude02\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026. Duh, that\u2019s Body Armor\u2019s whole thing. But why can\u2019t I get it for grandma?\u201d \n\n\u201c\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f grandma is allergic to coconut, kid.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh, sh$&.\u201d \n\n\u201cYep. She\u2019s fine, we got away with it, but\u2026 yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny other allergies I should know about?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell I thought you knew about the coconut, but it\u2019s just coconut, cantaloupe, sulfa drugs and her doc told her to claim a Vicodin allergy because it makes her feel like she has bugs on her face. She\u2019s not actually allergic she just trips balls and wants to play in the snow and then gets face bugs.\u201d \n\n\u201c\u2026. I want to hear that story later.\u201d",

Washing them suuuuuuper well (2-3 times, with soap) reduces the effect but doesn't eliminate. Organic apples are fine. Likewise raw walnuts and almonds make my mouth/throat hurt, but toasted are fine. I have an aunt who developed an awful allergy to fruit skins when pregnant with her 2nd kid - she's super allergic to the peels of both tomatoes & peppers, but can eat them with no trouble if she peels them. So you don't necessarily have to give up the whole fruit, you might be allergic to a component that's not always present, present in one part but not all, or denatured by cooking :)",

But I just chalked it up to eating too much in one sitting. Like a whole 10oz container of fresh pineapple at once. Lol\n\nA few days ago, I finally got to cut the pineapple I'd bought last week and stuck in the window to ripen. I was so excited to eat this pineapple! It was a beautiful golden color and smelled amazing! \n\nAfter spending way too long cutting up this thing, and coming close to severing some fingers, I finally get to take a bite of this glorious pineapple. Before I had even finished chewing it I felt a tickle in my throat. So I hurried up and swallowed it so I could clear my throat and take a sip of water.\n\nWithin seconds my entire mouth was prickly and I couldn't stop (what I call) the \"tickle coughs\", those little involuntary coughs when there's a tickle at the top of your throat or back of your mouth. The prickly feeling in my mouth quickly intesified. After a few minutes I swear I could feel the pricklies from my mouth all the way down to my stomach. Another few minutes after that, my face became itchy. I ended up having to take a benadryl.\n\nI've never had a reaction from one bite of pineapple or even one this bad after eating a whole container. I think I can almost certainly say that was the last time I will ever taste pineapple. Lol",

In fact the enzymatic process as it rots increases the part you're allergic to.\n\nI'm mildly allergic to pineapple too but the fresh ones don't seem to bother me at all. It's once they're past their prime that they start to bug me.\n\nSo buy your pineapples fresh as possible, keep them in the fridge, and eat them as soon as possible.",

It was originally a Martha Stewart recipe I found by googling \"upgraded ramen\" in 2014. \n\nCook noodles a minute under done and drain water. \n\nBase is 3 tablespoons of peanut butter and Sriracha, 1 of soy sauce. I add like half a seasoning packet, but it's up to you. \n\nAdditions can be either powdered or fresh - onion, garlic, ginger, bell peppers. A great option is to saut\u00e9e it in sesame oil in a separate pan, adding the base (and gochujang) to that. Once mixed - add the noodles. \n\nTo balance it out, I highly recommend throwing all of that on a bowl of steamed broccoli or spinach. Adding some scrambled egg is always nice too. \n\nWhen I cooked it this while interning in DC, I got my food budget under $100/mo - because I couldn't even finish half a packet of ramen this way. It reheats really well too, the noodles somehow get more springy. You can make a large batch in advance (with seasoning packet, just keep adding spices and peanut butter until it tastes balanced) and fridge it, then just spoon out a bit and reheat in a bowl, then throw noodles on that. 3 minute meal. \n\nI don't know what it'd be called though, if there's a dish close enough to it already (it's too different from pad Thai IMO). Spicy sesame garlic noodles? Spicy peanut sesame garlic noodles? The only thing I make more regularly are the J Kenji Lopez Alt best roasted potatoes.",

Also in the original \"recipe\" (it's like one paragraph) they say to keep a bit of the water, but I basically only use as much as what comes in from the noodles naturally. Ive seen it done with a good amount of the water and it just seems like the same thing, different form.\n\nHeating up the PB makes it less viscous. I guess by saut\u00e9ing aromatics, it might help the texture with the additional fat and veg water content. I might add a splash at the end, but only a little at a time. It might be the whole 'breaking the sauce' thing where there's no emulsification\n\nI'd imagine the flavor would be dispersed in the broth, compared to an ultra rich condensed sauce that has simmered for 30mins -- which adds a sort of heaviness that I don't get with normal ramen in a broth. Also gets a bit of a toasted flavor\n\nhttps://www.marthastewart.com/349053/ramen-noodle-upgrade",

                  "text": "Edit: tried this. Was delish. Added the cooked ramen plus a bit of water to a pan of sesame oil, peanut butter, sriracha and soy sauce on med heat for a min. Stir and serve. OP is correct, a ratio of 1:1 between peanut butter and sriracha works well. Added a splash of lime juice at the end. (Also added some scallions and frozen veggies, but that's whatever). Tastes filling as fuck, too. Thanks!\n\nEdit edit: I did use a 2 tbsp:2 tbsp:1 tbsp ratio of peanut butter:sriracha:soy sauce as 3 tbsp would have been too peanutty for my tastes for one ramen packet.\n\n---\n\nI am intrigued by this proposal.\n\nQuestion. You say you add 3 tablespoons of peanut butter and 3 tablespoons of sriracha. The original recipe you linked suggests a ratio of 2 tablespoons to 2 *tea*spoons.\n\nDid you just up the sriracha amount because the original wasn't sriracha-y enough? Asking because it's a pretty big deviation so I'm curious how you settled on that so I can adjust my first attempt if necessary.\n\nEdit:\n\n>Additions can be either powdered or fresh - onion, garlic, ginger, bell peppers. A great option is to saut\u00e9e it in sesame oil in a separate pan, adding the base (and gochujang) to that. Once mixed - add the noodles. \n\nThat sounds delicious and I think I'll try it tonight!",

They also keep a good bit of the water so it's more like a peanut broth which I don't like\n\nHowever the best way to make it is to taste and adjust the ratios as needed (when making a large batch of the sauce in advance), so the number of tablespoons is kinda irrelevant IME\n\nHope you like it!",

And then there's mead-making, which will explode the glass bottles if they get capped before fermentation is entirely ended. And then he built a semi-portable furnace for melting metal, complete with propane tank for fuel, with the whole contraption on wheels so he can push it out on the porch before using it.  \n\n\nHis latest puzzle is how to set up his gem grinding machine in such a way that, if the glue fails and the stone flies loose, it doesn't smack him directly in the face.  \n\n\nPretty sure he survives on pure luck. With all the possible explosions he plays with, most of his injuries are just broken toes from keeping his workshop area too cluttered.",

I've given up on the kitchen table, it's a lost cause, but at least I finally got the linen closet back after husband got bored of using it for a mead brewery!  \n\n\nI know all this sounds like complaining, but it's a good thing. The mead is delicious, the metal work beautiful, the tools come in handy for my own stuff sometimes, and he can fix most problems at home with stuff on hand and a YouTube video.

I feel you though, I\u2019m also allergic to some pollens (birch and true grasses), developed as a teen, and then the OAS followed. Apples, cherries, peaches, apricots, hazelnuts... plus a bunch of seed allergies, hemp, flax, sunflower. Sunflower has gotten bad enough though that I can\u2019t eat it cooked or uncooked without throat swelling, so that\u2019s a no-no now. They started out being just mouth itchy, and over repeated exposure, have become much worse and now it\u2019s immediate Benadryl if I eat them and lots of GI pain. Avoiding some it doesn\u2019t become immediate EpiPen if ingested. Hazelnuts also don\u2019t do nice things, but if extremely well cooked and processed, I can eat it. For now anyways. I also have (anaphylactic) allergies to cashews and pistachios. So fun /s. Anyways, there\u2019s my cautionary tale of not repeatedly exposing yourself to the thing that makes you allergic lol",

It's less about the colour and more about the shade and consistency of the colour. Peanuts have variation in the colouring, extra highlights and lowlights that help inform what it is even if you're colourblind. Peanut butter is just one uniform colour, and if you're colourblind it's mostly similar in shade to a lot of greens, so it's a super easy mistake to make.",

I grew up with cats and have never not had cats in my home in my 35+ years of life.  About 5 or so years ago, I first started noticing that I\u2019d get a stuffy nose sometimes during spring shed and It\u2019s been getting gradually worse ever since. Now I get swollen lips or a small patch of hives on my neck if I have them hanging around my chest or face too long, and I have a perpetually stuffy nose without nasal allergy meds. Now during spring shed, I avoid cuddling at all because I\u2019ll get wheezy and difficulty breathing. It\u2019s devastating! I never knew I could develop allergies to pet dander after being constantly exposed to it my entire life so I was really surprised when it started getting bad enough that I had to start keeping my distance a little bit and limiting how long I can let them sit on my lap. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m always giving them tons of love and attention, but definitely fewer kisses and no more letting them sleep near my head and face. I have an appointment with an allergy specialist in weeks to explore allergy shots or something more effective to treat it. But I recognize that even with effective treatment, I might just have to accept that I\u2019ll be in some level of discomfort around cats and so be it. My cats are my babies so they\u2019re not going anywhere ever, I would never consider rehoming them for even a second.",

I had epi pens in my purse but wasn't thinking well enough to realize I needed it. My kids realized it though.",

And your allergy can progress to this point without any indication until one day your throat is closing from a kiss within minutes. This is why zero tolerance policies for peanut allergens exist and why people with peanut and bee allergies are given emergency injectors to use. These are the two most common ones to see a sudden massive increase in reaction with. \n\nThis is completely random. Your immune system might give you a mild reaction to peanuts one day then a massive anaphylactic response the next, then back to mild reactions. Contrary to common belief it does not progressively get worse either. It's literally random. We don't completely know why this happens or what other factors may make it worse, or why peanuts seem to do this more often than other mild allergies. There is even massive debate among doctors about the effectiveness of allergy therapy treatments vs the risk of random responses to the treatments themselves.\n\nedit: clarified bee stings comment",

My kid is a picky eater so I used Google to translate the ingredients. It would go between fish, Eel, and squid.\n\nI said if I'm brave enough to eat this weird fish meat, you can probably handle whatever it was at the time that he hated.\n\nIt was really salty, smelled awful, tasted ok. I let him have a few more peices of candy and we went to bed.\n\n\nI woke up and felt weird. I went to the bathroom and as I was exiting the room I walked past two mirrors. The one on my left made my face look crazy in a side profile so I turned and looked. My lips were huge and red, the back of my throat was scratchy. I went to the er. They gave me 2 epipens and some Iv meds.\n\nTurns out I'm mildly allergic to squid. It's weird because I can eat almost every other shelfish but I had never eaten squid before. I slowly went through the whole shellfish collection that I cared to try again. Lobster, shrimp, crab, etc were all fine. \n\nIt feels super weird to not have eaten a certain food your entire life and to accidentally bump into something you're allergic to.",

                  "text": "This is how my fish allergy started as a kid. My parents didn\u2019t make me eat it because they honestly didn\u2019t like fish much themselves. It also isn\u2019t that weird in my culture for kids to not like fish because it is something that isn\u2019t eaten all that much in my region. It is always available but not a main staple or anything unless it is lent and then Lake Erie perch is suddenly EVERYWHERE along with other fish offerings. \n\nAs I got older, I started trying more of the foods I have disliked as a child because I figured my taste may have changed. Lots of things were still nasty other things were fine. I tried a fish stick and I didn\u2019t dislike the taste or the texture or even the smell, but there was still something about it that just made me really not want to eat it. Even as an adult I couldn\u2019t really say what it was that was turning me off. After eating one bite of a cod fish stick, I had tingly red lips. For some reason, this wasn\u2019t a red flag to me. I then spent hours in the bathroom with my body purging out both ends. \n\nI thought \u201cmaybe I\u2019m allergic to fish?\u201d and then moved on with my life of continuing to not eating fish. A couple weeks later, I noticed that my lips would tingle and get red and puffy anytime my boyfriend ate fish and then kissed me. I also noticed that mozzarella sticks sometimes make my tongue tingly in the same way. That is super weird because no part of mozzarella or the breading or anything is something that I am allergic to and I can eat those things without a problem in different contexts. It also only happens sometimes and not others. One day, my brother pointed out that mozzarella sticks and fish sticks are probably fried in the same oil at some places. That seems pretty reasonable so I think maybe cross contamination is something I actually need to worry about for my allergy. \n\nAt this point, I assume actually eating fish again would result in a much more severe reaction then I had the first time.",

That's crazy! Is it spicy like salsa? No? Is it spicy like soda (I always described carbonation as spicy as a child)?

Thankfully with my allergist giving me fexofenadine 2x day at 180mg and taking at least 2 piriton/Benedryl I can function. I don\u2019t eat fruit or veg, and since being on a Keto diet I\u2019ve also had less reactions.

Oh sure, they're everywhere but they especially seem to like to concentrate in your sheets and on your pillow case.  It took me a while to figure out why my sinuses hated me whenever I tried to sleep.\n\nOn the topic of sleep, I have sleep problems and have been sleep deprived my whole life and only thought I was \"lazy\" the first 2.5 decades of my life.  It was in my late 20s that I finally got a sleep study done and found out my sleep quality was pure shit.  Waking up just as tired as when you went to bed is not normal.  Being tired 24/7 regardless of how much or how often you sleep is not normal.  Having never experienced a \"rested\" state in my entire life, I had nothing to compare to.  What's worse, being chronically sleep deprived also deprives you of the ability to think in general, much less do critical introspective thinking about your current mental state.\n\nWe really need to start handing out manuals to people explaining what \"normal\" is supposed to be.  I swear, I wonder how many of us have problems like these and just never figure it out.  Figuring this kind of thing out on your own is really hard.",

That's even if the serving I eat has no kiwi, so a small fee drops of juice are enough to trigger a tightened throat, but it was milder at first.\nI remember the second time I ate kiwi complaining it scratched, and it was hot making my throat hot. Not believed of course, like others say kids don't get believed at first. \nBut spicy... that really sums it up I think in a way others can understand.\n\nIt's also reminded now of the only thing I've ever seen anyone else react to that was even vaguely similar.

Had never experienced it before but I was having to consciously decide to swallow my spit and knew something was immediately wrong. Went up to the teacher and asked for a pass to the nurses office and she wrote me the note without question.\n\nIt's scary stuff. Having a nut allergy is serious. You have to be careful about what you eat. At some point you'll get good enough to be able to eye ball most foods and know, but you'll still get a surprise every once in a while. Get an epi pen asap and carry it with you in a backpack everywhere. I'd also carry benadryl everywhere. Can't tell you how many times benadryl has saved my ass.",

I didn't know about this so I started panicking that I was having an allergic reaction, while driving, in the middle of nowhere. I think my panicking was making the tingling feel worse that it was as I have had the same ginger beer after that and it's very mild tingling. I pulled over and started googling (because that's my first reaction to what I thought was an allergic reaction lol) and found out it can happen with strong ginger ales/beers.",

A couple years ago I was in the break room with all of my coworkers, including several doctors, eating lunch brought in by a drug rep. There was a big bucket o\u2019 guacamole and damn right I helped myself to several scoops of that shit, seeing as I don\u2019t typically have guacamole type money so I tried to inhale as much as I could for free. My whole life I\u2019ve always disliked how guacamole tasted \u201ccarbonated\u201d and made my mouth feel like I ate a sunburn. I always assumed this was some preservative added by restaurants to keep the guacamole from turning brown. (Doesn\u2019t make sense, considering I\u2019ve had it made fresh in front of me at restaurants and it still tasted carbonated.) But if you\u2019re born and raised in California, daily life typically involves avocados of some sort. I\u2019m no coward. \n\nThis particular batch felt extra bubbly and I made a comment to the doctor I work with about how carbonated it was, in between coughs. (Again, I\u2019m a dumb woman, I know) several of my coworkers stopped eating and stared. I felt my neck and chest get flushed but I was embarrassed in that moment, so whatever. My throat hurt, I felt itchy. My skin was red and splotchy. My doctor said \u201cyou\u2019re an idiot. You\u2019re allergic. You need to stop eating that,\u201d gesturing toward the chip loaded with guac headed toward my stupid mouth. He went and grabbed Benadryl from the emergency kit and I took it. Felt a lot better and my mouth didn\u2019t feel so sunburned. Blood test confirmed the allergy. \n\nI still eat avocados on occasion, and I know I shouldn\u2019t. I know it could get worse. I don\u2019t live in California anymore so my access to avocados has been limited, which is probably prolonging my stupid life for the foreseeable future.",

There are some recommendations to give your young kids common allergy-causing foods in very small amounts when they're first starting to eat solids. The thought there is to watch for reactions and also on the theory that exposing them to minor amounts when they're young will help prevent any potential allergies. But if someone has a confirmed allergy, at any age, the exposures they do are much, much smaller than you could do by actually preparing and eating the item. I'm currently getting allergy shots for some environmental triggers, and I have to get four shots weekly for the first eight months, then every 2-4 weeks for at least another year, and up to five. They start with incredibly tiny doses, like micrograms' worth, and slowly build up over time. Unfortunately, some people try to self-administer or put their kids through DIY exposure therapy by just consuming small amounts of allergens, which can easily trigger a dangerous reaction. So it's definitely not recommended to do at home!",

Separately, I also kept getting self diagnosed 'food poisoning' every time I tried lobster (everyone insisted it was so good I just had to try it at such-and-such).
