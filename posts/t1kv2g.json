The few others take the shit seriously and follow it for real because they feel part of something. \n\nI mean, that's how it was back in the days when I lurked (way back during the cockmongler days). The mantra was always \"Don't take the internet seriously\". That was before every old redneck uploaded their fucking asses into the grid with FB in their hands.. The old ways collided with the new, and you can't tell it apart. Used to be a place to vent, or say the worst shit you could imagine, just because you could, not because you necessarily meant it. Now, the internet is reality. You say it, it's you.. I've come to terms with it, and go the earnest route as an adult. It is what it is. Shit's too fucked up now to be duping ignorant people into following ignorant ideals. It's not fun, it's tiring. \n\n...and of course OP (if being serious) would piss himself silly with his little Vienna sausage if he was in a war. Anyone \"excited\" for shit like that has no connection to the reality of it.. at least not yet.\n\nEDIT: I'm really tired so I hope some of what I said made sense.",
