He\u2019s getting revenge directly on the one who wronged him which in my opinion makes it more okay",

Feelings? Words? Fantasies? Actions? Lack of action? And who or what is responsible for someone being evil? \n\nLike all humans, Frankenstein\u2019s monster isn\u2019t wholly a product of either nature or nurture. Nature may seem to be responsible (since he was made unnaturally, with a \u201ccriminal\u201d brain) until we realize the monster is not wholly evil, has the capacity to reflect, feel shame, and know what evil is. This isn\u2019t different from many psychopaths who have insight into their condition, but an inability and/or unwillingness to change how they act. And if Frankenstein\u2019s monster is evil because of its brain or some other \u201cpart\u201d of it, then that it is part of its humanness that makes it evil. \n\nBeyond that, its evil deeds are no more unusual or evil than those perpetrated by any \u201cevil\u201d human. When we look at him closely, he is entirely human, and that is what horrifies us. We all have \u201cthe monster\u201d inside of us. If we didn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t be here because our ancestors wouldn\u2019t have had the ruthlessness and grit to survive back when life truly was nasty, brutish, and short for just about everyone. \n\nThe monster, like all of us, has the ability to kill, to hurt, to harm; or to do good, to love, to care for. Most humans do both: we harm people intentionally sometimes; sometimes unintentionally. We also love and care for people, even if only incidentally.\n\nSo I think that if we stare at the monster long enough, we may realize we are the monster and the monster is us. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t write anything about the role of nurture because in Frankenstein because I\u2019m too lazy and don\u2019t remember a lot of details from a book I studied almost 20 years ago. Most of what I\u2019ve written comes from my memories of Young Frankenstein.",

The main cause of it was the police letting too many people into the standing terraces. More and more people piled in, more died. Adults and children alike, suffocated to death mainly. \n\nThe Sun then published stories alluding to stereotypes of people from Liverpool - that they are thieves. They constantly published that the fans caused the events and then while it was happening they were robbing people's possessions from then. \n\nThis was a city in utter grief of the situation. Families torn apart. And then that utter scum rag of a \"newspaper\" was pointing at them and lying about them to sell papers. \n\nNot to mention the police coverup they gladly took part in. \n\nSo in short no it's not \"banned\" it's boycotted.",

There was a stand allocated for the Liverpool supporters where it was all standing, no seats. To ease crowd control at the entrance to the stadium they decided to open one of the gates at that part of the stadium and it caused an influx of fans coming in to these stands. Well there was a human crush and 97 people died. \n\nThe Sun newspaper claimed that the Liverpool fans robbed people who were laid injured/dying on the floor and even urinated on them and stopped the police doing their job. Basically blaming them for the disaster. This wasn't true and fans actually helped paramedics get injured people out of the stadium. \n\nIn the inquiry into the disaster, which took almost 30 years to conclude, it was legally determined that the lax security and crowd control was to blame. Kelvin Mackensie, the editor of the sun at the time had refused to apologise for years even after the Liverpool fans were absolved of blame. Eventually he, and the sun gave a weak apology, which by then, too little, too late.\n\nSince then, The Sun has sold very badly in Liverpool and as I said some shops don't even stock it or refuse to. The Sun has been truly gross in some of its stories through the years, but this is the most infamous.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the silver whoever it was.

                          "text": "It's also important to note that Frankenstein had several outs when it came to the Monster. Initially, he could have simply just not freaked out and neglected it when it first animated, thus avoiding the situation entirely. When he was confronted by the monster on the mountains, he had the option to accept it in spite of it's horrible appearance, having full knowledge that the monster is an intelligent and emotional creature after listening to an extremely lengthy monologue from it. Finally, the Monster asks him to make a second female monster, promising to leave him be if he had made one, but Frankenstein destroys it. Notably, Victor also knew that the monster had killed his younger brother, but instead of admitting to the monster's existence and potentially looking like a madman, he chooses to protect his own reputation and allows an innocent woman to be executed for the crime instead.\n\nThe monster was not inherently evil, and a huge chunk of it's monologue is about how it tried to befriend a rural French family, even helping them from the shadows, but their rejection of him upon seeing him fucked him up mentally. Victor could have avoided the murders entirely if he had just done his duty as a creator and either taught the monster to live peacefully, or if he had killed it at first.",

The one thing I want to point out if the idea that creating a wife for the creature isn't actually guaranteed to solve the problem at all. Mostly because there's no guarantee that they would get along. It's a small point, but still worth bringing up imo.  \n  \nThe monster was not inherently evil. That being said, some people go too far and portray the monster as innocent. Which isn't true. Neglected and abused, yes, but the monster was still really calculating and knew about morality. He did evil things knowing they were evil. But that probably doesn't happen if Victor (and/or the rest of the world) treated him better. He was a blank slate capable of both good and evil, just like people in general. So really, the story is about how one horrible person ended up creating another horrible person despite it being entirely avoidable",

He wouldn\u2019t just make a slave for him. At any rate, Victor (and several critics) believes that the act of creating the Monster was an atrocious and unfair act, and repeating that mistake wouldn\u2019t solve anything. The Bride could have suffered in this world just as much as the Monster, if not more so\u2014 and what if she didn\u2019t even want to be with him? \n\nAt any rate, Victor wouldn\u2019t shelter or care for her any more than he cared for the Monster. In fact, both of the monsters becoming estranged outcast was part of the initial deal. \n\nAs to say whether or not Victor deserved it? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s entirely relevant; Elizabeth, Clerval, the maid and Victor\u2019s little brother\u2014 those four certainly didn\u2019t deserve to die for Victor\u2019s actions.",

Guy couldn\u2019t work eyes on his crime against humanity and abandoned it\n\n\nHonestly it\u2019s one of many great analogies in the story, (my favorites are the ones that contrast victor to Prometheus and how victor is a failure in compassion) \n But it\u2019s supposed to tell you how chasing perfection is bad and it will only make your flaws more and more obvious.",

So if Shelley is following Greek Tragedy, as she appears to be, the situation was destined to end in tragedy, and the moral is the same as it is in Prometheus - don't take things from the Gods and allow the \"natural order\" to prevail.",

The Monster eventually takes shelter in an abandoned woodshed owned by a French family. He hides in secret and imagines the day he reveals himself and they love him. In reality, they are horrified and beat him up. He flees and resentment for his \"father\" grows until one day he murders Frank's young brother and pins the murder on a housemaid Frank considers his sister. She is executed. The Monster then demands Frank make him a bride or he'll keep killing people. Frank refuses and the Monster kills his best friend and pins it on him. Luckily he has an alibi so he isn't charged with murder. Frank gets engaged and the Monster tells him he'll see him on his wedding night. Frank assumes he will die but instead the Monster murders his bride and Frank's father dies of grief as the Bride was basically an adopted daughter to him. Then Frank vows revenge and the Monster says \"good fucking luck, douchebag\" and flees. Frank chases the Monster to the Artic until he nearly dies of exposure and exhaustion. A passing Explorer's ship happens to save him long enough to tell this tale to the Explorer. Frank dies and the Monster appears to the Explorer and basically says the feud is over now that Frank is dead and he's going to go kill himself.\n\nSo while the Monster is a victim of abandonment I don't think that justifies very meticulous and planned serial killing for revenge. He's definitely the bigger asshole.\n\nIf you want a modern comparison it's basically The Joker except Frank is Society.",

In him, I saw a reflection of myself, as someone who had been neglected and bullied. I wrote the paper before we even got around to discussing the book, because I had a serious research paper for another course due on the same day.\n\nMy paper got an A and praise from the professor.

The point of the book isn't that one's the monster and the other is innocent but rather that they're effectivley the same person. That's why they're both effectively \"Frankenstein\". They're both people who deny the monstrosity of their own actions and yet refuse to see each other as people and in the end they not only ruin each others life but also their own.",
