Imagine if, by common law, all the shareholders of a corporation had to be the employees of that corporation. That would bring wealth to the workers themselves, to the point where each of them has an opportunity of owning capital.

But they go to the root, and help th widows and orphans.\n\nThat's what's wrong with a lot of this. People don't love their neighbors, because they dont love themselves. And it trickles down as well.\n\nStop hting on people with different views. Take an inward look. Be the better person. Shits got you divided without realizing it.

Religions aren't always \"comprehensive and flexible\" because that varies person to person.\n\n\"If there's no afterlife then why does it matter if your religion gets it wrong, it's not like you'll go to hell or anything.

I don't believe in the principles of any religion so I don't believe in any afterlife. I don't think life has any meaning because you have to get that on your own. Religion holds no meaning to me and is not a way to get meaning but that's my opinion on it. It may be meaningful to someone else",

Think of this, the human body consists of 90% water, there's calcium, iron, and other elements and molecules that make up your body. But lest not forget, when you break down molecules and elements, you have atoms. Everything you eat, every time you breath, etc., you are introducing new atoms that make up your body. Some of atoms in the air you breath or the water you drink have been shared with the dinosaurs. When you consume things or breathe, they effectively become you do a certain degree. The things you ate as a child allowed you to grow in atoms to be physically larger. You have acquired more mass because you comprise of more atoms. Again, the atoms did not come from nowhere. So how much of you is even you?\n\nEven crazier is that electron transfer is happening all the time, everywhere, all at once (lol). This means that the electrons that are inside the atoms that create your body are transferring in and out of you from objects, people, and materials that are all around you. There is no such thing as 'you' in a sense. The hippies did kind of have it right, we're all one, man. Or \"we're all just stardust.\" Bits and pieces that have once been part of you are literally littered all around the world. SO, you don't really vanish into nothingness, you're pretty much being recycled all the time, even when you are... idk sitting here reading this Reddit post (ie. your skin cells are constantly shedding). \n\nAs far as consciousness, who can really say. But since the brain does rely on chemical and electrical signals, and:\n\n\"First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The total amount of energy and matter in the Universe remains constant, merely changing from one form to another.\" \n\nThen I suppose you're just converted into a new kind of energy, but you won't be destroyed. (probably).",

Later, I lost someone very important in my life which understandably made me pretty sad. Without religion to fall back on, it was just a senseless loss. My family felt comfort in their belief that they'd see them again, but I had no such comfort.\n\nI probably wouldn't call myself atheist today, but the way I've sort of reconciled it is this: there's nothing that can be done in this life about loss or what happens after you die. All you can really do is try to make your life the best you can, and help your fellow humans do the same. \n\nI'm kinda splitting the uprights of \"Don't consider an afterlife in how you live, just be a net positive to the world\" and \"If I live my life the best that I can and whatever God doesn't accept me, that's not a God I want to spend eternity with\". I find these to lead to basically the same decisions. \n\nAs for yourself -- I don't personally think there's any harm in having some sort of belief for yourself if it brings you comfort. Maybe you're not right, but that's likely going to be true for 99.99%+ of humans ever. As long as you don't use your religious beliefs to push views onto others or act like a dick, I say what's the harm? Keep believing in reincarnation.",

None of the authors of the books of the New Testament are believed to have directly known or spoken to Jesus and Jesus didn\u2019t write down anything that has been found. All of his teachings reach us through layers of oral tradition, heresay, and multiple conflicting authors. We really don\u2019t know what he said, believed, or was like.\n\nOdds are he was a Jewish preacher who believed he was a Jewish Messiah, as messianic thought was popular during his time when foreign Romans governed Jerusalem.

              "text": "Some certainly do believe that. Others I think believe in some sort of judging based on the rules at the time (near-term, Jewish rules or \"The Old Law\"). I think the Catholics believe Jesus went down to the \"realm of the dead\" and did the same thing for everyone who came before him there. I've also heard that not having had the chance to hear about Jesus was basically a free pass to Heaven, which has me wonder why anyone would do missionary work. You've basically damned them to hell lol.\n\nAs far as religions go, I actually find the Mormon church to be the fairest in that regard weirdly. After death, everyone's spirit goes to either \"Spirit Paradise\" or \"Spirit Prison\", depending on your faithfulness in life, collectively just called the \"Spirit World\". The idea is that those in spirit paradise try to \"spread the good word\" to those in spirit prison, and it's still up to them to accept it or not. You remember your life on earth, but not the \"premortal life\" (which is a whole other thing that most Christians don't believe in).\n\nThat's where baptisms (and other ordinances) for the dead come from. They do religious ordinances as a proxy for those who didn't have them done during life, but the dead people still have to accept it. There's also the end days where (as I understand it, I wasn't exactly a scripture scholar when I was in), Jesus rules over earth and everyone gets resurrected, you have a final chance to do all of this. Then everyone gets \"Final Judgement\", and sorted into the different tiers of heaven, where you then remember the premortal life as well. Mormons don't *really* have a concept of hell, so nobody is going there. \n\nThe way I understand Mormon Hell (called Outer Darkness) is that it's only for people who have a perfect knowledge of God and reject him. Which is like 5 people in the scriptures and nobody today.\n\n(I know there's nuances to a lot of this that I've missed, but that's the general idea)",

              "text": "yes - also related to lead poisoning. You can track the changes over time relative to when abortion services change and also when lead in gas was ACTUALLY removed in each region. Strong correlation. \n\nAnother strong correlation is maternal death (e.g. moms dying) and restricting abortion services. \n\nWhen Texas restricted abortion services maternal mortality (e.g. moms dying) skyrocketed (doubled). That's just mom's dying - that didn't include maternal morbidity (e.g. kidney failure, massive bleedouts, sepsis, nearly dying, years of recovery, etc)\n\nWhen Ireland removed abortion restrictions in 2018, Maternal mortality went to zero every year since.\n\nPart of the reason is that the fetus attaches to the mother using a immune-system avoidant technique and a pre-nutrition lock to blood supply that is similar to how parasites attach. If all goes well - then that's fine. If, however, there are any issues then the mother and fetus fight for survival. If there's a miscarriage (e.g. spontaneous abortion, that's why the reported rates in the US are so high, because miscarriages are counted as abortions) that's not going well, and if you don't act immediately, that's a risky death sentence for the mother.\n\nIn Ireland, [Savita Halappanavar](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-20321741), a dentist, in the 2nd Trimester went in with complications and was told by a government contractor \"Because of our fetal heartbeat law - we cannot perform an abortion\" and that statement, killed her.\n\nWhat's going to happen in the US now that Roe-v-Wade is destroyed is that all the states that ban abortions will have more women die.\n\n---\n\nRead on for supporting citations to the above statements: \n\nAbortion statistics in the US include miscarriages.\n----\n\nState laws in places like Florida and Texas have been changed to create more stats for babies being \"alive\" after \"abortions.\" That's not a misquote.\n\nI was just debating someone on reddit and they made a really odd claim. It was\n\n> In 2018, the [Florida Agency for Health Care Administration reported 6 infants born alive after an abortion attempt.](https://ahca.myflorida.com/MCHQ/Central_Services/Training_Support/docs/LiveBirthsByCounty_2018.pdf)\n> \n> .... Do you believe it's OK to kill a child born alive after an abortion and/or deprive the child of adequate medical care?\n\nand I was like ... wait ... is that really a thing? So I looked at the above link and as you'll see it is nearly completely blank. No stats, no details, no links to methodology, ... just a number.\n\nI looked for the source and it turns out that this claim is repeated on Qanon-like blogs and websites all repeating the same thing over and over again about all these babies \"surviving\" abortions without evidence.\n\nSo I started searching through the Florida dept of health, etc and I finally found this document: https://ahca.myflorida.com/MCHQ/Health_Facility_Regulation/Hospital_Outpatient/forms/ITOP_Report_Guide.pdf [archive site in case it disappears](https://archive.is/jAuzb) which mandates both how to fill out the ITOP report and as part of that **redefines** what \"alive\" means AND includes as a *definition of \"abortion\"* the FL legislative definition to **include** miscarriages. Quoting from the text\n\n> Select the appropriate response.\n> \n> \u201cBorn alive\u201d is defined in 390.011(4), F.S. as: \u201cBorn alive\u201d means the complete expulsion or extraction from the mother of a human infant, **at any stage of development**, who, after such expulsion or extraction, breathes or has a beating heart, or definite and voluntary movement of muscles, regardless of whether the umbilical cord has been cut and regardless of whether the expulsion or extraction occurs as a result of **natural [labor]** or induced labor, caesarean section, induced abortion, or other method.\n\nSo medical providers are *mandated* to define a baby \"born\" without a brain as \"alive\" according to this definition.\n\nAlso medical providers are *mandated* to define an expulsion event as a result of **natural labor** (e.g. miscarriage) as abortion.\n\nRemember the woman in Texas arrested for a miscarriage as attempted abortion? Mandated reporting.\n\nSo a miscarriage that results in a baby twitching once ... fits in this definition of both \"alive\" and \"aborted.\" Baby born without lungs and barely any brain? \"Alive\"\n\nMore on Texas and statistics in the next section.\n\n----\n\nMore women die (including Texas doubling mortality rates) when abortion is restricted and fewer when abortion is allowed (Ireland statement):\n----\n\nTexas:\n\n[And maternal mortality spiked](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/20/texas-maternal-mortality-rate-health-clinics-funding). Something that wasn't seen in adjacent states, or from the article ....\n\n\n>   the **doubling** of [maternal] mortality rates in a **two-year period** was hard to explain \u201cin the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval\u201d. .... No other state saw a comparable increase.\n\nSo something unique to Texas. Something dramatic changed there in 2011 that was not also seen in the other nearby states. That rules out climate and immigration (AZ & NM) and immigration as a cause is further ruled out by knowing that  [immigration rate has decreased](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/flow-of-illegal-immigration-slows-as-us-mexico-border-dynamics-evolve/2015/05/27/c5caf02c-006b-11e5-833c-a2de05b6b2a4_story.html)\n\nThe only thing that was different between Texas and all the other nearby states was this:\n\n> The researchers, hailing from the University of Maryland, Boston University\u2019s school of public health and Stanford University\u2019s medical school, called for further study. But they noted that starting in 2011, Texas drastically reduced the number of women\u2019s health clinics within its borders.\n\nWhich strongly pointed the finger of death and disease at the people who created this \"experiment\" \n\nIt got so bad in 2014 that Texas decided \"hey - our rates are toooooo high! Let's *redefine* how to calculate Maternal Mortality Rates with a new [enhanced method](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/legislative/2020-Reports/DSHS-MMMRC-2020.pdf)\"\n\nIn the traditional Maternal Mortality Rate calculation, Texas is at 32 moms dying per 100,000 births. In the \"New and Ehanced\" method they are at 20 moms dying per 100,000 births.\n\nSo Texas is now at either 32 or 20 moms dying per 100,000 births (depending on if you accept how the QOP politicians are attempting to redefine \"alive\" and \"deaths\")\n\n\nBut it wasn't just Texas and Ireland:  In [country](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629620310596) after country, [around the world](https://bmcwomenshealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12905-018-0705-y), when abortion is legal, maternal morality (e.g. DEATH) goes down and the opposite (more death and morbidity) when abortion is blocked.\n\nIreland:\n\nAfter the investigation from Savita Halippanar's death they found other women had also been killed because of the foetal heartbeat law in Ireland. The national uproar ended up changing the law in Ireland and made abortion legal. Ireland already had one of the best maternal care records in the world. But it got better as Ireland's maternal mortality went to 0 for each year after.\n\n|Year | Maternal Deaths  Per 100k Births: Complications of pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium (O00-O99) | Context\n|--- | ---|---|\n2007  | 2.80  | Abortion Illegal\n2008  | 3.99     | Abortion Illegal\n2009  | 3.97     | Abortion Illegal\n2010  | 1.33     | Abortion Illegal\n2011  | 2.70     | Abortion Illegal\n2012  | 2.79     | Abortion Illegal\n2013  | 4.34     | [Abortion Illegal: Savita Halappanavar's death caused by law and a \"fetal heartbeat\"](http://cdn.thejournal.ie/media/2013/06/savita-halappanavar-hse-report.pdf)\n2014  | 1.49   | Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act of 2013 passed.  abortion where pregnancy endangers a woman's life\n2015  | 1.53    | Abortion only allowed with mother's life at risk\n2016  | 6.27    | Abortion only allowed with mother's life at risk\n2017  | 1.62    | Abortion only allowed with mother's life at risk\n2018  | 0   | [Constitutional change, Abortion Allowed, 2013 Act repealed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-44256152)\n2019  | 0 | Abortion Allowed if mother's *health* is at risk\n2020  | 0 | Abortion Allowed if mother's *health* is at risk\n\nDeath Data Source: https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/VSD09/JSON-stat/2.0/en Birth Data Source: https://ws.cso.ie/public/api.restful/PxStat.Data.Cube_API.ReadDataset/VSA18/JSON-stat/1.0/en from the Ireland's Public Health records at Ireland's national data archival.    https://www.cso.ie/en/aboutus/whoweare/ and stored at https://Data.gov.ie\n\nNote: I linked to the raw data and it only goes back to 2007, because Ireland's OWN data scientists state: [\\[prior to 2007\\]  **flaws in methodology** saw Ireland\u2019s maternal mortality rate fall \\[without justification\\], and figures in previous reports \\[prior to 2007\\] should **not be considered reliable**](https://www.thejournal.ie/maternal-deaths-mortality-rate-ireland-pro-life-campaign-statistics-2921139-Aug2016/)\n\n\n\nNote this is ONLY *mortality* and not also *morbidity* (e.g. kidney failure, hysterectomies, etc.).\n\nIf it was one year it might have been a fluke but it was 3 years running.

While the US ranks either [first or second](https://www.businessinsider.com/countries-largest-antidepressant-drug-users-2016-2) with Iceland in surveys other developed countries are not that far behind. Antidepressant use has significantly increased in European countries in the last decade.\n\n>When almost 100% of mass shooters are on some type of SSRI we need to at the very least question why.\n\nThis is [simply untrue](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/aug/16/whats-behind-dubious-claim-psychiatric-drugs-fuel-/). It is a claim the Church of Scientology has been making for 25 years regularly publishing 'studies' to gain headlines with the actual data they produce not supporting the claim. \n\nIf SSRIs were the problem, and it is hard to see how given how they work, you would expect a rise in violent activity in all developed countries since 1987. In fact the opposite is the case. Taking [murder rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate_by_decade) as a violence marker there has been a significant fall even in the U.S. from 9.4/100,000 in 1990 to 5.0/100,000 in 2018 and this is also true of other developed countries\n\n- [The myth of school shooters and psychotropic medications](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bsl.2429)",

Its claims are BS. Scientology actually grew from L. Ron Hubbard's [Dianetrics therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics) scam. Hubbard essentially plagiarised that other charlatan, Sigmund Freud.  Demonizing psychiatry and psychology is part of the Church's business model. It began by preying on the mentally ill and continues to do so.\n\nIf SSRIs are the problem then how do the CCHR, and you, account for the murder rate nearly halving since SSRIs were introduced in 1987?\n\nPS: The first recorded school shooting was [in 1840](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States_\\(before_2000\\)),  147 years before SSRIs. They have continued with monotonous regularity ever since.",

My version of atheism is more absolute apathy to the whole religious concept and little to no influence of religion in my daily life (except for the like 500 religious paid public holidays that Germany has each year. In this case I find religion not so bad). \n\nAll that being said, the idiots in America currently using a very loose interpretation of cherry picked parts of some old fantasy book to attempt to control not only their own life or their own body, but the lifes and bodies of all americans, leave me speechless. \n\nFirstly, what does a random book that you like have to do with my life?\n\n I personally love trashy historical romance novels, read them daily, research them endlessly. Love them. But it's never come into my mind to try to force people to dress in Regency english dress or go and fight the French on horseback with a sword. Nor do I advocate for love at first sight across a crowded ballroom or any of the other obviously unrealistic (and honestly slightly toxic) concepts around choosing a life partner. \n\nWhat makes their book so special? Why does their book get to decide laws? And, like you said, if they are going to follow the book then why not all of it? No mixed fabrics and the rest of the madness. \n\nJust cos you like a book doesn't mean you get to make decisions about my life based on it.",

The real decline is the fact that we haven't moved forward as a society. We're caught between the rasicm of the 50's and the progression of today. I don't think that we should force people to do anything like give up their ideals, but I do believe that we need to take huge leaps to move forward. Revise the constitution, remove the older generation from politics by setting age limits and mental health evaluations for all members so we know the people leading us are the right people. So much stuff needs to be done but no one who is qualified, because I very much am not, is willing to step forward and actually fight for what needs to be done.",

      "text": "Christians want to blame societal chaos on a lack of adherence to their own version of their own faith, whose leaders have told them that their god punishes those who turn their backs on it. It's a cop-out. They have either no ability to see cause and fault beyond this or are simply dismissive of bad things that happen to other people.\n\nLeaders of their faith make really poorly arguments that tragedy is due to a backsliding of Christian faith in various ways after the fact and from a distance. They make callous and outrageous arguments that god doesn't protect people from these tragedies (shootings, natural disaster, etc) because they are not Christian enough. These statements are not a warning being delivered to the heathens in an effort to get them to change their ways, they are being delivered to their congregations as a warning; another attempt to place fear into them to prevent them from following others away from the church.\n\nWhat is most alarming to me is the backflips of reason they go through and break their own rules to asset this hateful rhetoric:\n\n1. God (or Jesus) is love- this hippy jesus freak mantra doesn't fly any more. There is no real love for others being shown by their followers and throwing their lot in with politicians bely their intentions. God is control and the illusion of safety in numbers. Churches are businesses that make a few people very wealthy. They will play their god however they need to maintain their cash flow and to bring in more wallets. This notion of a soft, squishy, happy god is a bait and switch marketing ploy.\n2. God protects his followers- natural disasters, school shootings, etc indiscriminately takes the lives of believers and non-believers alike. If a heathen dies in a flood, it was obviously because god was angry; if a christian died in the same flood, god had a plan for them. There's no ability to have any real discourse with people who ignore reality in this fashion.\n3. Bad things are because a formerly \"Christian nation\" has turned it's back on god- pure propaganda and historically false, believed by those eager to deny truth, stay uneducated, and maintain control. We currently have access to more information and education at our fingers than ever before in history. Churches have to use no less than outright mind control to veer people away from the truth and keep them in a delusional fantasy world of magic and nonsense. It is scary how well this works.\n4. Schools are a target for violence because prayer has been removed- historically false, grossly callous and disgusting, an excuse to avoid political and social issues. If putting god to the forefront in schools makes kids safer, why are priests, preachers, and other church adults molesting children in the church so easily and with almost no consequences? You would think that a building full of people protected by god would come under his wrath for abusing the innocent. Leaps of false logic are used to prevent NRA members, church goers and funders, and the hateful from asking simple questions about their choices and how they may be influencing actual tragedy.",

The right get to the media first, with their BS, because they dont need to deal with pesky crap like facts and evidence. Its like in 2008 when the housing crash hit, the entire conservative machine went into overdrive blaming a law from the carter years, and jimmy carter.. for a crash in 2008.. due to a law that was modified 3 times under bush.  a law that had exactly dick to do with the crash. now the actual post mortem of the crash took a good month to work out a good idea of all the bits, though we knew a lot of it was the right winger idea that banks would self regulate.\n\nso when the barely paying attention public turns on the tv, they are inundated with the right winger explanation first. and the left have to explain that no it wasnt that all the poor people in the US suddenly decided together to buy too much house, and no it wasnt a law made in the 70s suddenly blowing up the economy.\n\nand they do these things because the real answers says bad things about them and their ideology.\n\ntax cuts to billionaires dont trickle down.\n\nbanks do need self regulation.\n\nspreading of hate, mainly from the right(along with all their scary imagery, some of the ads for these fucks this year are mega disturbing, where if we posted that shit as individuals we would get a visit from the ATF and FBI) and unwanted kids and the fact we have more guns than people and really shit laws and regulations governing them, is why we have these things. \n\nAnyways, its easy to point to the flaws in their ideas.\n\nRED STATES by far, have the most crime. including murder. BY FAR.\n\nand yet red states are the most restrictive when it comes to abortion and LGBT... in fact most right wing ideas could be fought this way, like the fact that red states are low tax states but blue states blow them away economically. Shouldn't it have trickled down more and all theri citizens being rich?\n\n[every negative stat, looks like an election map. look at this one and realize you do not want to live in a red state, especially dont want to raise a family there.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/homicide_mortality/homicide.htm)\n\nthe most murderous state is Mississippi, followed by Louisiana.\n\n\nand [that map is nearly a mirror of the map of states by religiosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_religiosity)\n\nwith the exception of utah, the mormons go to church a fuck ton but dont murder a lot of people. go figure the people who got their religion out of a hat, appear to be the least crazy.",

Also no money for mentap health programs and you get women hating online connected disillusioned young men with a hate for society and women who wish for old traditional societal norms to make a comeback. As a cherry on top, the number of unhappy women is also at an all time high, because of these developments... If we as a modern society like it or not shame was used as a successful barrier for this problem for centuries.",

The issue with shame is that it was a tool which caused much pain in healthy sexual development but was also a barrier to what is happening now. If you remove shame like society did in recent yeara without teaching people, that there is no such thing as free sex ( free as in free from responsibility and free of ill effects on society and personal development) Then you are simply ignorant of the facts of modern times. Having loads of incels in your popilation is not a good thing. Men giving up marriage is not a good thing. Yet many of you guys here see the evil religious boggy man in such news. How about thinking about solutions to these problems? And news flash: screaming destroy tue patriarchy is not one of them. This is not about religion at all for me, as I am leaning towards harcorde atheistic thinking, but an unstable society is simply not a good thing.",

We changed the way our society works, without proper care for the bad side effects this has. This goes for men and women. If sexual promiscuity is not shamed but praised this leads to many sexless average guys, many unhappy average women who can't find guys the like get into steady relatuonships with them. (instagram and tinder skewed their perception of the dating market because the guys who are willing to have sex with them are not the same group in social media who are willing to go steady with them) And after that whole trouble for a majority of people, there comes the aftermath for many girls, who too late realize these dynamics and try to catch a husbad (e.g. I am ready now for marriage) and then find out not that many stable sane men want a girl which had a body count as high as a mountain. Please note that I am not shaming girla specificall for this. In my experience man AND women change psychologically if they have too many note: casual sexual encounters. They have a real difficutlty forming stable relatuonships and not running away at the first sign of trouble, because in their unconcius mind the next better partner is a swipe away. To me these are not religious but psychological factora for which society needs some way to deal with them. playing the blame game will not help these people and will not help society.\nTLDR: Like it or not shame waa useful to keep society and sexual markets stable, since we abandonded it we as society need a new tool, since unhappy unmarried older women and many sexless young men are not good for us.",

Women having the ability to be discerning is not the reason that your numbers (if they are verifiable) on sexless men are so high.
