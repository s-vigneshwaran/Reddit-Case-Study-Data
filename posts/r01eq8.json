You can choose to believe that when 12 random people who have a select amount of some of the facts and evidence surrounding a case say someone is innocent or guilty, that makes it absolute fact. I don't. I believe our justice system is corrupt from the bottom to the top. And I feel like denial of that fact is naive.\n\nSo, feel free to think it's unfair to call a rapist a rapist. Brock Turner, the rapist, WAS convicted of sexual assault but his sentence was 6 months in jail because the judge felt prison would have a negative effect on him. He only served 3 months. The amount of time he served doesn't make him less of a rapist. Just because you feel there's a clear difference between rape and sexual assault, doesn't mean you're right. Rape is rape. Calling it sexual assault, even in the eyes of the law, is splitting hairs. He's a rapist.",

IN GOD WE TRUST was first used on paper money in 1957, when it appeared on the one-dollar silver certificate. The first paper currency bearing the motto entered circulation on October 1, 1957. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) was converting to the dry intaglio printing process. During this conversion, it gradually included IN GOD WE TRUST in the back design of all classes and denominations of currency\"",

It\u2019s the separation of institutions that they were going for. They were setting themselves up for political power and didn\u2019t want to have to share it.\n\nThat said, they were all Christians and of course they wanted (and likely needed) the legitimacy of being religious. God is mentioned right in the Declaration. \n\nNothing was done in those days without it being evaluated on religious grounds. Does god hate all slavery? Or did god create black people to be beneath white people? Hm. [debate for centuries]\n\nBut the founders never had any illusions that the government would be entirely free of Christians or Christian influence. To them, Christianity was ubiquitous. Of course the government would be entirely populated by Christians. And while they managed to depart from the idea that supreme executive power derives from the divine right of kings, they never departed from the idea that *moral righteousness* derives from God (and people at large still have not made this leap).\n\nSo in short, we absolutely have the separation of church and state that the founders intended: a separation of the institutions. But they couldn\u2019t even conceive of a world without Christianity, or where its influence is moderated, let alone eschewed. They literally *couldn\u2019t even imagine* that.",

Splendid, abortion is now a spiritual rite and must be respected as a religious practice.\n\n\nOur mission will finally be over when religious organizations are held to the same standard as everyone else; we HOPE our tax-exempt status is removed, because it will mean we've won.\n\n\nPS- I know this isn't common knowledge, but, be cautious throwing the word \"goof\" around, it means \"child rapist\" in prison.",

Democracy is not the problem; the model of human nature underlying our conception of democracy is the problem. I refuse to believe that people can't be trusted to live their own lives while following their nature.\n\nIdeally, those people that *are* able to think rationally should be able to govern society without being affected by the ignorance of the hoi polloi, but the hoi polloi should still have their grievances heard and addressed without being dismissed by an elite, and there should be some sort of control to ensure the elite aren't just preserving their own imperatives, or those of other powerful forces in society. The problem that's become apparent over the last five or six years is a) the hoi polloi aren't very good at even identifying their grievances, let alone voicing them coherently, especially if malicious actors direct their rage towards the wrong target, and b) I don't know if there's ever been a society where the hoi polloi aren't suspicious of rational and logical people, or if one is even possible. Then again, the age of modern democracy has been marked by the rational elite assuming everyone thinks and acts like them and disdaining anyone who doesn't fit their model of human nature, accidentally exalting the sort of psychopath that's the last sort of person that should be trusted with power and acclaim in the process; a more accurate model of human nature could get them halfway there.\n\nMy ideal system of government involves groups of 20-30 people who each choose representatives to groups of 20-30 people who choose their own representatives and so on until you have a group of people who between them represent the entire planet but each of whom are members of groups whose membership totals less than [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number?wprov=sfti1), somewhere less than 200.\n\nI don't know if any of this actually addresses any of your points, I'm largely thinking out loud.",

Considering what it did to his mentor, Plato had reason to be very distrustful of democracy.\n\nOf course, few would consider Plato's republic to be the model of how society should be organized, though much of the history of political philosophy seems to have been \"how close to it can we get without ending up with something repulsive or unacceptable to what we perceive the masses to be?\"\n\nI do think we should be teaching logic and critical thinking more than we do now, it's just that I'm not sure there's a path to get there, that people would make use of it even if they were taught it, or that it could overcome their cognitive biases, which is a problem when our model of democracy depends entirely on a significant majority of the masses using it. Right now democracy seems to be self-defeating, unable to defend or enforce its most basic premises and actively opening the doors to its enemies, and blind to these problems by clinging to its flawed model of human nature.\n\nA good model of democracy and government should be self-reinforcing, able to instill the character it asks for by its own nature and repulse any attacks on it. It should achieve a maximum of desirable outcomes with a minimum of investment from the people at large, because freedom may not be free, but it shouldn't be enslaving. It should be able to detect unrest and vulnerability to demagogues among the people and correct its root causes before it gets to the point of inhibiting its functioning and threatening its structure and existence. To the extent it demands rationality and critical thinking from the people at large, it should actively incentivize it rather than merely assuming its existence or that the people will know well enough to promote and safeguard it. In other words, it should be able to ignore the ignorant ramblings and conspiracy theories of the hoi polloi, but still be incentivized to work towards their betterment and address their legitimate grievances, without being prone to being hijacked by those that would exploit those grievances towards their own ends, and it should be open to everyone willing and able to contribute productively to the discourse.\n\nI don't have any concrete solutions for what this system might look like, but besides what I already suggested, as a relatively simple, less radical change I'd like to adopt [range voting](https://rangevoting.org) for single-winner elections. This would prevent elections from devolving into a simple binary choice and would incentivize people to actually look into the candidates and assess their desirability. At least, it would incentivize the election of candidates broadly desirable to a large cross-section of the electorate over candidates with a passionate base of supporters unacceptable to most other people but, in most other voting systems, potentially able to bring along enough of the people in the middle to edge out their competition.",

And it's also a nightmare. Every presidential election during the first term we have about 8 choices of candidates, but you know what happens? Polarization and colligation, because that's politics.

How can we get this movement going for real?\n\nEdit: I have tons of ideas. I would go to local schools and provide introductory critical thinking courses, providing simplified study packets on epistemic issues like what counts as evidence, how we get knowledge,  what the most common logical fallacies are, how we evaluate the reliability of a historical source, how to form a deductive argument, etc. This would be a dream come true! But only if I can also simultaneously afford to live (and print those packets).\n\nEdit 2: We could have our own Vacation Bible School in the summer, and it would actually study the Bible... along with all other holy books and some atheistic literature, too! It would be a survey of world religions and cultures mixed with introductory science (evolutionary biology, chemistry, anatomy, astronomy, geology) and philosophy (epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, the philosophy of science)... We'd look at things under microscopes, we'd have physical activity (and learn about its benefits, both physical and psychological)... There's so much you could do with this if you had some funding!",

It's a concept that the things you hold to be true are actually true and is a valuable way to find meaning/purpose/whatever. Obviously many people have capital F faith, but to a degree it's erroneous, because there's as much proof that there is some sort of higher being as there is proof there's not.

      "text": "This kid will almost definitely be going to jail/prison at some point.  Here's what's glossed over in most articles about this, for some background:\n\nHe pled guilty back in 2019.  He was placed on what's called \"interim probation\" for two years, with a promise that if he were successful - that is, if he doesn't get in trouble or violate any of the terms of probation, he will get a promised sentence, in this case 10 years probation (with credit for the two he already did).  It's not clear if he was supposed to get a youthful offender adjudication but that seems likely.\n\nSo then he screwed up by violating interim probation by viewing porn on his computer which is a violation of the terms of his probation (sex offenses get additional restrictions).  So since he violated his interim probation, typically the judge can sentence him to anything he wants, up to the maximum possible sentence (here, 4 years on each of the felonies).\n\nThe Judge decided to stick with the probation sentence, but to sentence him as an adult instead of as a youthful offender.  The practical effect of this is huge.  If he were adjudicated a youthful offender, his convictions are set aside and replaced with youthful offender adjudications, and the records are SEALED.  \n\nBeing sentenced as an adult, he gets no such protection, so he is a convicted felon for life (NY sealing laws don't apply to sex offenses).  Additionally, a youthful offender does NOT register as a sex offender, but an adult offender does.  So in a few months he comes back to get his risk level determined, and he may be on the sex offender registry for the rest of his life.\n\nHonestly, he would have been much better off keeping the youthful offender adjudication and going to prison for a few years, it would be rough but after it's over his record would be clean.  Now, he's fucked.\n\nBack to the going to jail part.  He's still on probation for another 8 years, with all the regular conditions of probation plus sex offender conditions.  If he screws up again, which seems likely, he will be back in court, in front of a different judge (this one is retiring in a month), who can sentence him to up to the maximum.  Given the case history he'll be going to jail or prison for sure.  So if/when that happens, he gets locked up and still has lost his youthful offender status.",

He raped 4 people, it's still completely crazy not to just send him to jail for 16 years, 4 years for each crime. Why would anyone decide to give someone probation rather than 16 years in prison, just in the hopes he'll mess up his probation and end up in jail anyways? Why is the maximum sentence for rape even only 4 years, that's crazy low for raping someone.",

My grandfather was taken into custody by the police once years ago, when the cops called my father they told him he was supposed to be registered and had never done so. It turned out my grandfather had been a child molester and did time in the 30's, 40's, and the 50's. My mother knew about it and kept it to herself, he also molested my adopted sister.  He never registered even though it was required in 1947 onwards in my state. I fully believe he molested several other girls that lived near him until the 70's early 80's. He's dead now but my regret is I didnt kill him and my grandmother when I had the chance.",

But knowing the US justice system I have a pretty strong feeling that this just grew out of some judge's personal prudish beliefs about porn being evil and/or sick punishment fantasies. Now, I'm not saying that rapists shouldn't be punished, but criminal justice punishments should be regular and ordinary (e.g. jail time, community service, fines), not random shit a single guy gets to make up on the spot. Pretty sure there's something in the constitution about this, too.\n\nSex is a normal part of life and porn is a normal (and legal) expression of sex. Sex offense is a crime that should be punished with ordinary measures, but outside of that punishment the state has no right to go and interfere with the normal (non-offending) sex life of the convict. The probation terms for sex offense can't be \"you have to be abstinent for 10 years\", that's ridiculous... and it might just as well hinder the convict's chance of rehabilitation by denying him the outlets that every normal person is supposed to have. (Again, if there's credible psychological evidence to the contrary that may be a different matter, but just as a \"I feel we should make him not watch porn for 10 years to prove that he can hold it in\" it's bullshit and potentially encouraging reoffense.)",

If the decision includes a finding of guilt, then it cannot be appealed (unless by the defendant), except in exceptional circumstances (for example, SCTOUS has outlined only one situation where a finding of guilt may be appealed by the prosecution). \n\nEssentially double jeopardy means you cannot be tried for the same crime twice. In other words, you cannot appeal a finding of guilty or not guilty. However, if found guilty, you can appeal the sentence in certain situations, because the finding of guilt is not being challenged. If an appeal changes the sentence, it is remanded to be resentenced--they do not send it back to be totally retried.\n\nThere is a caveat that the accused may always appeal a finding of guilty (and obviously will not appeal a finding of not guilty). It is the accused right, so by appealing, he is waiving his right against double jeopardy for the appellate court to consider the appeal.",

The fine described in verse 28 is a penalty for consensual activity between adults that went against the patriarchial societal norms.

As someone who has studied a lot of Jewish law it goes like this. A girl  becomes obligated in keeping the laws when she becomes bat mitzvah at the age of 12. From here until she is 12.5 she is a naarah and her father or her husband both have a limited degree of authority over her (can annul vows she makes that affect their relationship with her and her father can marry her off by power of attorney) once she is 12.5 she is a fully independent woman and her father can no longer marry her off (though he may be able to annul vows she makes that affect their relationship) and anyone who wishes to marry her must go through the process with her and her alone. \n\n>So a woman didn't have the right to consent to sex without her father's consent.\n\nAgain see above. If this episode happened with a girl over 12.5 it's simply considered licentiousness which whole forbidden, carries no penalty unlike statutory rape.",

That judge in the rittenhouse trial, this judge here, both of them are not outliers, nor are they even the worst I've heard tale of. Horrible judges are all over the place. Horrible everythings run for their offices and said offices thus are filled with horrible people. If you don't like them, run to take their offices. Many of them run unopposed. Granted, most of you aren't lawyers, neither am I cuz I like my immortal soul, but some of you are. And I hope, nay,...I pray...that you'll take yourselves and put yourselves into the ring. You've nothing to lose, I mean, maybe you win? It's not like they shoot the loser in a political race like a horse with a broken leg.",

But someone stealing money will get years or someone dealing weed decades. Which would of been a better question or comparision.
