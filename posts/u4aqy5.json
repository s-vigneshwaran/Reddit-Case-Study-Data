          "text": "Actually the word Algebra comes from the Arabic word Al-Jabr (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u0631) which in a medical sense means the reunion of broken parts/ bonesetting (forcing bones together). And in it's broad linguistic meaning means subjugation/ forcing your will upon a thing. The word for tyrant is Jabb\u0101r: one who strongly subjugates his subjects. Stemming from the same root as Jabr. This is because the man who formally codified it and turned it into a major field was an Arabic speaking Persian who called it that in his math book. I've also heard that he did that to make easier the inheritance laws of Islam. He was the first to treat algebra as an independent discipline in his treatise on it and by that treatise it became popular, so it took the Arabic name.\n\nThe word algorithm comes from his name. In Islamic/Arab culture, a person may be known by his location. For example, \"the American\"/Al-Amr\u012bk\u012b (\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a). He was from Khwarzm (a town in between todays Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (forget which one it lays in). So he was called Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b (The Khw\u0101rizmian). And so Algorithm comes from Al-Khw\u0101rizm.\n\nEDIT: Al-Khw\u0101rizm\u012b in Arabic looks as such: \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0632\u0645\u064a",

Whilst mean and median are a type of average, it's common for average in English language to be used as a synonym for mean. So it's not unreasonable to assume a quote is referring to mean when using the word average. However as many have pointed out with a normal distribution then mean and median are the same. Though it must be said, they're mathematicians and shouldn't be trusted. :)",

Most people will swing between 85 and 115, the system is supposed to have theoretical boundaries of 0 and 200. But you can have people to frighteningly smart that they score absolutely bonkers on the scale of IQ like 450 ot 600. So right off the bat we can make the note that the distribution of IQ is asymmetrical this makes it very likely that the mean is higher that the median (or, applies to Carlin's quote: more that half of people are stupider that the average person). Then, let's assume the asymmetry is negligible, we assume, without any reason to believe so, that IQ is shaped like the bell curve (Gaussian Distribution) AND that the Central Limit Theorem applies.\n\n So the question becomes, are the variables independent, and are the samples measured representative for the population as a whole?\n\nWe know intelligence is not a hereditary genetic trait, but that children with intelligent (or rather well educated) parents become more intelligent/realise their potential (it's a huge privilege thing). So the variables aren't quite independent, and even if the intellectual potential is an independent variable, the realisation of said potential (let's call it the resulting intelligence) is very much not in independent variable.\n\nThen sampling. The tests are bad and should feel bad. We try to test a very narrow definition of intelligence which is in great part also very culturally dependant. Simply put, we are judging all animals on wether they can climb a tree, even the fish, birds and cows. Furthermore, people aren't tested at random, people are tested when there is a reason to do so. Either when you are too intelligent for your current school level, or when you are not intelligent enough. Again, these tests are rather narrow and have few capabilities of factoring in circumstances like learning disabilities, mental health issues, mood, sleep, diet, general emotional state of being. These factors (and many more) all have an impact on your performance on an IQ test. So again, we can't assume the outcomes of IQ tests\n\nSo what about school levels? Well, school tests wether or not you can do well on a test. It can't really test wether you are smart in general or what you are smart at. \n\nSo we can't apply the CLT, we can't assume the Gaussian Distribution to apply, we can't trust the outcomes of IQ tests and school can only five a very vague indication of what passes of for smart. \n\nAnd that's all without diving into IQ isn't close to the ability to see through bullshit from manipulative people, nor is it related to emotional intelligence, neither does it have anything to do with social and political insight. Sure, it's not completely unrelated (though correlation is not causation and for some areas you might notice a negative correlation). Not to mention that information is really overabundant these days and given a set of coherent data you can make anyone believe anything these days. \n\nStatistically speaking we are dealing with what Taleb calls Extremisten conditions where we try to apply Mediocristan tools. If you want to know more about the limits of statistics I can wholeheartedly recommend Taleb's books Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan.",

The concept is really easy to understand though. It states a property of a special kind of (man made) grouping scheme called a \"set\".

          "text": "I had a shirt with a silkscreened \"Hello, my name is\" name tag on it with, in a handwriting font: Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die.\n\nOne day, unthinkingly, I happened to be wearing it on a day I had to fly across the country for work.\n\nGot through TSA line without even realizing it.\n\nOn the plane, though, it was a different story.\n\nI'm sitting in my seat, headphones on, waiting for takeoff. Flight attendant walks up to me.\n\nHer: \"Nice shirt\"\n\nMe: <oblivious to what I'm wearing, abruptly realize, and smile> Thanks\n\nHer: ...\n\nMe: <why is she still here?>\n\nHer: Tell me about your shirt?\n\nMe: It's a movie reference.\n\nHer: I know\n\nMe: so... ?\n\nHer: ...\n\nIt went on like that for an uncomfortably long time. after several seriously uncomfortable, totally baffling back and forth exchanges...\n\nHer: Does it come off?\n\nMe: My shirt? Of course it does\n\nHer: The nametag\n\nMe: No, it's silkscreened on. Permanent part of the shirt\n\nHer: Can you take it off?\n\nMe: My shirt?\n\nHer: Yes\n\nMe: Of course. It's a shirt.\n\nHer: Right now. Can you take it off right now?\n\nMe: Sure, but why would I?\n\nHer: We had a complaint from a passenger about it. They feel threatened\n\nMe: And taking my shirt off will fix that? Like, it's ok in a bag but not if I'm wearing it? And never mind that I was wearing it?\n\nHer: Yes\n\nMe: that's ridiculous\n\nHer: Please take off the shirt\n\nMe: Seriously?\n\nHer: Yes\n\nrandom passenger: change your shirt, it's not worth getting arrested over\n\nMe: I'm not wearing anything under it\n\nHer: Do you have anything else in your carryon?\n\nMe: Yes\n\nHer: Where is it?\n\nMe: In this overhead bin\n\nHer: OK\n\nMe: <takes off seatbelt to get to overhead bin>\n\nHer: WHOA!!!! Fasten seatbelt light is on, WHAT ARE YOU DOING???\n\nMe: <sigh> ok. so you tell me when it's ok for me to get my shirt and I'll change it\n\nHer: ok\n\n(thirty minutes later, in the air>\nme: <asleep with my headphones on>\n\nher: <jostles my shoulder quite vigorously>\n\nme: <patient, but annoyed> to whom on this plane do you report?\n\nher: huh?\n\nme:  to whom on this plane do you report?\n\nher: what?\n\nme:  who's your boss here?\n\nher: I answer to the pilot\n\nme: can you please have him confirm that I have to change my shirt? because this is absurd\n\nher: <incoherent and angry>\n\nme: fine. whatever. I'll change my shirt\n<I just sit there>\n\nher: <continuing to stand immediately in front of me> well?\n\nme: it's in the overhead bin. I can't even stand up with you being where you are, it's the space I'd have to move into to get out of my seat and at the bin\n\nher: fine <storms off in a huff>\n\nme: <grab shirt, head to bathroom at back of plane- realize crazy flight attendant is there, so change course to the one at the front of the plane>\n\nOn my way to the front of the plane, I see another flight attendant who looks... you know... not deranged. So I ask for a moment of her time and explain the situation to her.\n\nOther Flight Attendant (OFT): <jaw dropped, stunned, mouth literally agape>\n\nrandom passengers: that's ridiculous! no way! that's a great shirt! \n\nOFT: this is fine. don't worry about it, you can just go back to your seat. you don't have to change your shirt\n\nme: can I sit in a different seat? I'm really not comfortable sitting in that other flight attendant's section at this point\n\nOFT: the plane is full, I'm sorry, there are no other seats\n\nFrom the back of the plane, the power tripping idiot comes tearing up the aisle in a rage\n\nRaging Flight Attendant (RFT): <angry sounds, flailing arms>\n\nOFT: No\n\nRFT: But...!\n\nOFT: No\n\nRFT: !!!!!\n\nOFT: leave it alone\n\nrandom passengers: <cheering>\n\nme: spends rest of flight with the raging flight attendant being as passive aggressive as possible\n\n\nAnd that's how, in 2012, a power-tripping flight attendant single handedly ruined my perception of JetBlue, throwing it down from my first choice and sending it plummeting through the bowels and out the sphincter of hell.\n\n~~And that's how and why, 12 years ago, in a single flight Jet Blue went from my favorite airline to one I'll never again use under any circumstance.~~\n\nedit: rewrote last paragraph courtesy of an idea I liked in the comments.",

          "text": "For a couple of semesters, I had to fly back and forth from home to college during my breaks with my molecular modeling kit for my organic chemistry class in my checked-in luggage. The first few times, TSA kept taking my molecular modeling kit out for \u201cinspection\u201d and would \u201cput it back\u201d by scattering all the little pieces in my suitcase while neatly placing the box these pieces came in neatly on the top. And added a little note telling me my luggage had been checked by TSA. If you\u2019ve never seen an organic chemistry molecular modeling kit before, these can have 100s of tiny little pieces that need to be organized into little compartments so it can be easily used. It was also very clearly labeled \u201cMolecular modeling kit for organic chemistry students\u201d. I was already so stressed out from my classes and seeing the neatly organized set being casually strewn around each time just kind of broke me a little and had me in near tears. Ain\u2019t nobody got time to reorganize after every flight. So by the 3rd time, I had finally had enough. I was tired, sleep-deprived and stressed out, and decided that for my next flight, I\u2019d attach a handwritten plea begging for mercy to the box for the next TSA agent. In the note, I explained that I was a tired, sleep-deprived student just trying to  survive and learn organic chemistry to help create new medications for people and maybe go to med school to heal people. I said I understood why they felt the need to check because it looked foreign and they\u2019ve probably never seen an organic chemistry kit, and that they were welcome to check and test it, but I begged them to at the minimum, just put the contents back into the box. It didn\u2019t have to be super organized, but at least, just back in the box. I begged  them to have mercy on my poor soul. Added some tear-streaked words for extra emphasis. I taped the note to the box and hoped for the best. After my next flight back to school, I picked up my checked-in bag, arrived at the dorms, and tearfully started to open my bag expected chaos to stare back at me. As I opened the bag, I once saw a note from TSA announcing that my bag had been checked. But to my joy and utter disbelief, the blessed TSA agent had not only put all the pieces back into the box, but it was also organized correctly! The contents had shifted to slightly different compartments, but each compartment had only one type of piece like it was supposed to. I literally cried from joy. I only had to fly a few more times with that same box, each time with that note attached. It was always checked, but in one piece and neatly organized afterwards. I think I was so pitiful that even the calloused TSA agent felt bad for my miserable soul. Fortunately, I no longer need the kit at all, and can do it well in my head. And now I have computer software just in case lols. Anyways, apparently chemistry is scary, but TSA does have a heart buried deep down or I\u2019m just that pathetic hahahaha",

I was pulled out by a flight attendant on delta because my t-shirt was offensive. it was a white shirt with a skull printed on the back. no swear words or anything on it but it had some like viking runes. some fucking Karen felt the shirt was satanic and threatening. I had to remove my shirt and put it in my bag and wear my hoodie without a shirt on or they would kick me off my flight. it was so stupid. it made me so mad that this random lady could force me to change clothes. I knew she was having a power trip by making my life a little more frustrating. these Christian nutjobs have so much say over other people in America. I wish I could have looked my accuser in the face and had some choice words with her but they hid like cowards behind the flight attendant.",

And these all share the world view of a people the world over who never leave their town, or are sheltered to only see a world that looks and acts just like them. Its why universities are such a Liberalizing force because for the first time many people see people from other walks of life and interact with them. It's why cities that are so densely packed and have more mass transit are more progressive. Because they interact with people. \n\nAnd bigotry in communities comes from tribalism and fighting for life. And it ends with envy and greed trying to make up reasons why it's ok to take and abuse others to get what scraps you can get. This is something I think italy knows very well as well. The whole world knows this but we don't like to think about it.",

After a short greeding I continued with my stuff as I noticed her suddenly starting to huff and curl her nose in disgust, looking around half panicking waiving for the train personal.  \nI took out one of my headphones when she started aggressively looking at me and started, half way shouting and spitting \"what an indecent piece of s\\* and a scumbag I would be\", etc etc.)  \nI was... dumbstruck as well as the train personal (a young woman) when this old \"lady\" started to panic and told/halfway screamed at us, that she was scared for her life, since \"this evil boy practiced satanic rituals and tried to steal her soul\".\n\nIt was fluiddynamics....\n\nWell the guy in the isle next to us almost cried for laughter as we (me and well as the young women from the personal (a fellow student as it turned out) explained that I/we felt sorry that she felt intrigued by this calculations, and that we are sorry that she, as he said herself, \"had never seen such a uncristian thing\", but this would not hurt her or steal hers, or her dogs soul. - I mean, like wtf??",

The \"differential\" comes from the fact that the equation may contain derivatives of the function. So for example,\n\nf' = f \n\nwould be a differential equation. The solution would be any function whose derivative is again that function.\n\nThey are useful when studying phenomena where its not so easy to describe the quantities themselves, but how they change. For example, if there is a virus spreading among a population and its doubling its duplication speed, its hard to say how many more cases that will lead to precisely because its exponential growth (if you start with 10 instead of 5 cases, the difference will be much higher than 5). However, its fairly easy to see that this doubles the speed at which the amount of new cases increases. So we know that f' turns into 2\\*f' because the derivative describes the speed at which something grows. \n\nOnce you note down how each aspect youre modeling affects f' and subsequent derivatives, you can try to find a function that has this growth-function by solving the differential equations.",
