The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Ichthyology  most of the jokes will go over a typical gamer's head. There's also Tom Nook's Capitalistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Adam Smith's literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Animal Crossing truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Tom''s existential catchphrase \"yes, yes,\" which itself is a cryptic reference to Ayn Rand's dystopian American \u00a0epic Atlas Shrugged. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Aya Kyogoku's genius wit unfolds itself on their Nintendo Switch(trademarked and sole intellectual property of the divine Nintendo Entertainment Company). What fools.. how I pity them. \ud83d\ude02\n\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Gyroid tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid \ud83d\ude0e",

Nope.\n\nBanking?  Nope.\n\nOil Industry?  Nope.\n\nTrading partners?  Not really - maybe India, China, and countries who use the Russian banking system to get around sanctions, e.g. Venezuela, Guatemala, Cuba, etc.  Those last few are definitely hobbled.\n\nTrading rubles for Yuan or Rupees will be fun.

Your bespoke tailor can use the same kevlar/aramid fabrics in their own creation.\n\n\"Only\" being useful against handguns is still a lot more protection than a cotton/wool suit. When a VIP is exposed in a location where a long gun is a threat you'd use higher end armor, but for regular wear in areas that would generally be hard to get a rifle into hangun protection is likely seen as good enough.\n\nThe weight difference is not all that significant. A heavy wool suit jacket weighs around 3lb, while a similar jacket with an aramid layer weighs around 6lbs. Yeah, it's double the weight, but on a well fitted piece of clothing it's not going to be a big difference. If you live in a cold climate your heavy winter coat is likely 4-5lbs, so again, we're not talking much of a difference.\n\nPeople who use this level of protection don't make a point of bragging about using it, so I'm not sure what source you want me to provide other than more links that you can have a suit made like this.",

It seems unlikely that a local tailor knows how to work with Kevlar, especially since it's so strong.  Also cutting Kevlar makes it weaker and less built resistant. \n\nYou mention that a VIP would wear stronger armor in open areas, but most world leaders give speeches in the open, and they never wear rifle resistant body armor - which is much heavier and more obvious.  The only exception is the rare occasion when they stand behind bulletproof glass.\n\nAlso your last point seems to totally wrong.  Presidents normally wear suits from Brooks Brothers and Trump wears Brioni suits.  Also for Trump especially, you can see the thickness of his suit jacket from the loose fit - it's not thick enough to be lined by anything but canvas.",

Im sure there have been plenty of thwarted attempts on his life that we\u2019ll never hear about because the would be assassin just gets black bagged and executed. \n\n\nAs far as nuclear war, Putin wants to keep his power. That\u2019s all he cares about. Russia as a country will collapse without the west. We\u2019ve already seen analyses of how these sanctions will affect the economy over the next few years, and it\u2019s not good for Russia at all. If Putin turns the west into a crater, he has no stimulus coming into his country. In a scenario of mutually assured destruction, he\u2019s left with nothing when Russia is a smoking crater.",

How can you talk about rhetorical fallacies and then make one in THE VERY NEXT PARAGRAPH BAHAHAHA. Might wanna be careful trying to sound smart, then contradicting yourself lol.\n\nAlso, I took political science. I have had plenty of political debates. I also took rhetoric, of course. Now if you're going to cry your heart out in disbelief because I called you out on obviously being a little kid and it being ad hominem, please I encourage you to do so.

But maybe it's just me so brainwashed to see the faults of my own country vs. Russias. \n And I am dumb for pointing out the Ukranian president is jewish or the Russian Goverment is dumb for using this denazification line on a country that likely has the largest jewish population in Europe?

As the President, he has to priorise his energies and rely on his Cabinet and Chiefs of Staff to do the more detailed work within their own portfolios.  Were I elected President of my country -- or Prime Minister in our case -- I would rely on the Commander of the Armed Forces to organise and supervise the army.  If I were *really* focussed on defence issues, I might tell him/her to, say, step up recruitment and take a really close look at our borders, or to manage a troubled battalion by judicious use of transfers.  \n\nThen I'd leave it to him/her, and go back to working on the priorities of my office.  Among other things, Zelenskiy campaigned on fighting corruption in government, and that's not exactly an easy fight.  Further, he inherited an 8 year war in the Donbas -- another good reason not to interfere with his Chief of Staff's running of the Armed Forces -- which has strained the country's economy and society.\n\nI am not saying Zelenskiy is perfect, although he has clearly come into his own as a war leader, one who understands how to play the role and how to use modern digital media, and I agree with you that Putin and cronies are the villains in the piece.  I am saying that I have still seen no evidence that he actually, in any way, at any time in his life or in office, is actually a supporter of neo-nazis, and the mere existence of the Azov Battalion is not that proof.",
