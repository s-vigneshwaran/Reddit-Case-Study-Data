When she\u2019s fighting with Depp, she gaslights the hell out for him. It\u2019s too reminiscent of an abuser. At best, I think he hated her because of what she did to him. When I was in an abusive relationship, I used to fantasize about killing my partner because I thought it\u2019d help me cope with feeling like a coward for not leaving. But that\u2019s just me.

It honestly would feel more damning if she said his hand was in his pocket searching for his keys to drive to the store and buy ice cream.\n\nThis whole fucking case is hearsay. If she had a few hours of video of him being a drunk, maybe. But fuck man, I bet my friends have that much of me combined. If her claims are true she\u2019d have a damning video of him being incredibly aggressive towards her. Conveniently she only has pics of him. They were together for years. I know that\u2019s problematic to say, because many women in that situation may feel that filming it and get caught would put them in danger.

Hard to tell, but sometime it seems that Depp is winning over jurors with his funny responses to  Rottenborn and Rottenborn is not shutting it down but playing along.

It\u2019s not clear to me whether one of them was the main instigator or whether they are equally culpable. Both teams could argue they were reacting to the other\u2019s behaviour. The key difference so far is that Amber has admitted, on tape, to hitting him. But the trial isn\u2019t about whether she was abusive or not. So he could still lose.",

Several questions could have been hearsay, or irrelevant, but I let him just tell the story. Didn't need a whole lot of cross- the fellow admitted he was in breach of contract several times.\n\nIn closing, opposing counsel argued there was no contract because no money had been exchanged, when the fact that this guy hadn't paid for the airplane was the issue the entire time.\n\nWe won money. I won a headache and some disappointment.",

(if it's just your opinion as a layperson, then yes it's a good point but there's a limit to it that usa goes well beyond) \n\nIf defence are encouraged or even permitted to be as unscrupulous as they are currently, there's immediately massive mistrust in what even an honest and scrupulous defence counsel says.  This immediately robs the defendant of their right to presumption of innocence to at least some extent.\n\nAnd when the prosecution are considered in this context they no longer pursue the truth, simply convictions. They have to offset the defences lies after all.\n\nLawyers need to have duties to the court first and to their clients a close second.  Meaning if there's evidence clearing the defendant it must be brought (which I think is just an ignored law and not altogether missing) and defence counsels job is not to get their guilty clients off but to ensure they are fairly sentenced for the crimes they can be proved and nothing more. (much more to it)\n\n\nAnd speaking to your opening sentence about hearsay.  I agree yes, I'm just saying it seems to have fewer exceptions to the rule against admitting it. Ie. More evidence is excluded by it than i expected compared to what I'm used to.\n\nI jumped rashly to criticise that difference when in truth I should have been neutral on it given that I've not read any textbooks on the pros and cons of stricter/broader hearsay rules. \n\n\nExcepting the above, my reaction/opinion on every *other* aspect of US law that I've learned about and actually been qualified to compare and contrast with mine, has been at worst:\n\n* wow what a fucking archaic draconian system and the product of unchecked corruption.  (2A, citizens united, no consumer protections, civil forfeiture, judges don't need law degrees, judges are elected, sherrifs are elected, military ind complex,  letting any random person add any random clause to a bill rather than one bill per purpose, etc etc)\n\nAnd at absolute best:\n\n* oh, well I guess that's a system that arguably works given their gdp/population but there are alternatives that would serve them better (e.g. Intellectual property laws, namely re-patenting drugs.)",

All authentication is is a person saying the item or thing is what it is purported to be. So, if I took a picture of a crime scene and the prosecutor wanted to admit that picture he would need to call me or another witness to come and testify that that picture is a fair and accurate representation of the crime scene on the day of the event. None of that is related to hearsay. Similarly, for security footage, a witness would need to come in and testify to the accuracy of the footage - usually someone testifies about the security cam, how it operates, etc.\n\nThis is just a longer and more specific version of what I said, which is helpful, but I brought up how the video needs to be authenticated and/or testified to for this reason; videos aren't hearsay then\n\nBut I'm probably not clear in how I word things",

It needs said outside of court, outside of the context of having them under oath. So testimony from this trial is not hearsay. And for the truth of the matter. If I use a statement to explain how I felt and my motivation, the truthfulness of the statement asserted itself doesn't really matter.\n\nThe complicated stuff comes from that third part, the truth of the matter and all the exceptions. Hopefully the first two elements of hearsay (whether it counts as a statement made by someone and whether its made in or out of court) are clearer.\n\n\nThe idea behind hearsay is like this. If I say x person told me about y thing. Why are you relying on me to relay that? Its better to get it from X person's mouth.\n\nThe other part about it is that the whole point of court is to get the truth out of witnesses by questioning them (under oath to not lie). If you can't get the person into court, its unfair to use their statements.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/jpcyi5/making_memes_instead_of_outlining_for_the/",

That's because you are, let's assume, testifying about what the defendant said in order to provide evidence that there were, in fact, aliens flying around\u2014which, if true, would make the defense more credible.\n\nOn the other hand, let's say the defense's argument is that the defendant did kill his wife, but he's not guilty by reason of insanity. If you're testifying about his flying-saucer remark to establish that he was a delusional nut, that is not hearsay. Because you're not trying to establish that what he said was *true*, but that he's saying nonsense. (Basically, that what he said was obviously false, so he must be losing it.) thus, the defendant's out-of-court statement is not being offered as evidence that what he said was true, which is a crucial element of hearsay.",

From what I can tell the questions coming in the second half of the video are from the other attorney, so it's presumably in cross-examination. Which means it's perfectly fine to ask leading questions.\n\nHowever, listening to is fully, it doesn't seem at all weird that he asked him four times. I'd like to listen to the entire recording. But, as an example, when I question police I will ask them the same question half a dozen times if it's something I think is important for the judge to retain. For instance:\n\n> So, at what point of the intervention did you inform the defendant he had a right to counsel?\n\n> At the police station.\n\n> When did you arrest them?\n\n> On the road.\n\n> Before you informed them of the right to counsel?\n\n> Yes\n\n> When did you search them?\n\n> On the road.\n\n> Before you informed them of the right to counsel?\n\n> Yes.\n\n> When did you begin questioning them?\n\n> On the road.\n\n> Before you informed them of the right to counsel?\n\n> Yes.\n\nAnd so on. I don't have to repetitively ask them whether it was before they informed them of their rights because if it was on the road, it's obvious. But, I want the judge to have it drilled into them so I ask the question. It also makes the police squirm, which is a nice bonus.",

Questioning doesn't always occur at the time of an arrest either. So you are clarifying when 3 distinct actions happened in relation to informing someone of their right to counsel. \n\nIf instead you were to go, I have an affidavit about the events on the day in question. Can you confirm that is your signature on this affidavit?\nYes. \n\nIt says you arrested the defendent at 9am. \nYes\n\nThat is your signature on this affidavit?\nYes\n\nIt says you searched the defendent at 9:30am. \nYes\n\nThat is your signature on this affidavit?\nYes\n\nIt says you questioned the defendent at 10am. \nYes \n\nThat is your signature on this affidavit?\nYes\n\nIt says you read the defendent their rights at 11am. \nYes\n\nThat is your signature on this affidavit?\nYes\n\nThe signature hasn't moved, you just sound like an ass. Now if there are signatures/initials by each entry/page or something like that, now you're confirming a new piece of information each time. Once for an overall signature of the document, and then another of initials to confirm each line (like you often see in leases). \n\nThe way worded the first time, may lead ti someone who has a bit of charisma, as Depp did, \"is that the same signature that I have already indicated you are currently asking me about?\" Specially, if it happens enough times to be noticeable. \n\nTwice, sounds like you're just confirming. Five times, you either sound like an idiot or an ass hole. Especially if the person you're talking to keeps composed.\n\nAnd if they aren't composed, it probably would lead to another lawyer going \"asked and answered\" as many others have stated here is common in situations like these.",

The editing makes it seem as if the lawyer asked him the same question 4 times in a row one after another. But, that doesn't seem likely.

I had been in a relationship with a woman, who hit me really hard on my arm, when I did something she didn't like. While it wasn't meant to be aggressive and it really didn't hurt that much, the same behavior in opposite direction would have been seen as abusive behavior at no doubt. It is a thin line between \"joking around\" and abuse.",

I often see men using the instances where they've been discriminated against in favor of a woman as a talking point to say that feminism is bad, that women have their equality and that now they want \"more\" etc. but I never see them actually doing anything about their own rights, and it's infuriating to see.

Eventually, he was instructed to plead the fifth to all of OJ\u2019s lawyer\u2019s questions, including the final \u201cdid you plant evidence\u201d question, where he plead the fifth.\n\nThat evidence seemed pretty rock solid, this wasn\u2019t a coverup, certainly not by 1990s LAPD standards, and that legal team looked downright ridiculous through the whole process but holy shit did they sell the narrative",

The whole glove thing was just another part of that tactic, to show that the evidence was questionable.\n\nNow, that didn't change the fact that absolutely nothing else about the whole event would have made sense if OJ wasn't the murderer, but they put on a show and controlled the narrative to focus narrowly on that issue in an attempt to sow doubt.\n\nFrankly, though, I'm not actually sure it even worked. At least one of the jurors has all but said that she knows he did it but voted to acquit him just to spite the police for their treatment of the black community.",

He was a hero to a lot of people and had kindof transcended race (in fact, it seems like he himself didn't really want anything to do with being \"black\")\n\nFurthermore, and unsurprisingly, the police had a very bad history with the black community in LA, which crystallized in the Rodney King beating and the ensuing riots a couple of years before the OJ trial. \n\nSo, as a defendant, OJ was someone that was very likeable and well known. He didn't come across as a violent, dangerous person. The defense seriously distracted from the brutality of the murder itself, and placed the issue is police racism front and center.\n\nIn the end, I think that at least some of the jurors were able to say okay, he killed his wife because she was cheating on him (or at least he thought she was), but he's not a generally scary or dangerous person, and you know what? Let's see how the police and the white community of LA like it when the system doesn't do what they think is justice.",

For example if an attorney's examination isn't going well they sometimes will start to circle back in the hopes of stumbling upon something that helps them. If the questions are truly repetitive the judge will almost always sustain the objection, and it can force the attorney to conclude the examination if they can't think of anything new to ask. It's not the type of thing that's really going to be important on appeal.",

Well, exactly what this lawyer did, it's just clarification of a question which happens a lot in cases. It's an official question after all.\n\nOr, like the other two tactics people pointed out.

So the attorney keeps repeating himself. A good defense attorney will never ask an obvious question (eg so you lied?) because the person can then try to explain their way out of it. Instead he will get the witness to agree to conflicting statements and then sums up all the contradictions, lies, mismatched testimony in closing. Depp talking as much as he is just giving them more ammo, not less. And as a general rule, the more a witness has to explain things, the less credible they become. The truth doesn\u2019t change and is obvious. These text messages about him cutting off his finger are a good example of him having to work way too hard to explain something that would be obvious if she had caused it.

Any time something is not phrased in at least a neutral way he should rephrase it.\n\nFor instance he was asked if he was drunk on the plane after having said that he wasn't on direct. Both yes or no is a bad answer here so he did well when he instead answered that he had a glass of champagne.

He obviously would've brought up the same text messages to impeach that a no.\n\nA \"no\" on the drunk question and then a \"yes\" on the  2 bottles question that would've followed would've made him look like a liar, and a \"yes\" on the drunk question would've contradicted his direct exam and again look like a liar. Instead of what transpired: \"I had a glass of champagne, and I was hyperbolic in the text\".\n\n>He also could have just said I don\u2019t recall as the attorney had clearly set up that Depp was inconsistent in his recollection of 1) how long he had been sober for (it was less than 18 months) and 2) how much he had drank that day.\n\nWould've been decent.

What could happen is that the judge admonished Depp in front of the jury if he pushes his quips too far, but I haven't seen even a hint of that.\n\nThe only ones who should worry about the judge's opinion is the attorneys. If they annoy the judge then they are less likely to make legal rulings in their favor. But this judge seem very chill and the attorneys competent so that shouldn't be a factor in this case.\n\nBut yeah how this jury will rule is a complete crapshoot. Very shaky case for defamation, and the majority of the testimony given is about the shitty behavior and character of both parties. So will likely come down to likability.",

The fourth one was the only one separate from the first three, however it was all within a minute and thirty seconds of each other. Between the first three and the fourth he just notes the \"Joint statement for both sides to release\" statement regarding \"Neither parties made false allegations for financial gain.\" and \"You signed this 2 years before she made her op-ed\". Then he askes a fourth time if he was the one who signed that. Your argument does have merit, but how they asked and how many times they asked in such a short time. He ends the piece after the op-ed. It was a very small thing, just trying to establish a singular notif on the document at the very end of that setting.\n\nIf not for the fact that it was simultaneous. Though, I guess it could just be bumbling on their part. It's why I think this one's the highest likelyhood. Emphasis comes close second for me, but the point he'd be trying to make on it didn't actually hold much weight other than saying \"Amber signed this legal document. It was apart of the cross-examination setting which the judge let them close with. Only a few minutes, that all stood out as 'odd' there.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFDw2a-Ydf0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFDw2a-Ydf0)\n\n1:10:45\r  \n1:11:05\r  \n1:11:23\r  \n1:12:20",

It was separate from the prior document. Listen to the statement from about 1:10:00 onwards. It was disjointed. I gave you the context. He asked three times in a row, stating it differently the second time, and re-asserting his original question the third time then moving on to regard the \"No financial gain\" and \"No false accusations\" clause. Then asked him a fourth time if he signed it.\n\nIt was essentially divorce papers. The cut, as I said in another reply, was pretty much concerto with the actual occurrence on this portion. There was a lot of quiet sections as the examiner tried to find, pick out, and amend statements and questions he was asking/making. If this was actually his method in this scenario, it was extremely poorly done and seemed to serve absolutely no real point other than to say that Amber and He agreed they didn't lie, or do this to make money (Or make future money off it). Which, personally, seems like it would hurt Amber's case moreso to point this out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I did not in fact give you context. I thought this was under a different reply schema, my apologies. The link is there for you to listen to however, if you so desire. The cuts however, were just skipping a few seconds of silence or him asking to present the document. Mostly, there was what I stated before between the third and fourth, and after the fourth he says 'thats all for today'.",

Most trials are won in the heat of battle during each parties case in chief, but closing is where you tie it all together.

I can guarantee that, in order of importance, it\u2019s a combination of three things: \n\n(1) The most likely option is over emphasis for the jury\u2019s sake. The attorney believes that this point, that Depp signed this agreement, is key to his case. I\u2019d put money on this being a part of his closing statement. He wants to be able to refer back to this moment and say something along the lines of \u201cbecause of THIS document. That Depp willingly signed!\u201d He might even quote one of the individual Q&A\u2019s and read it verbatim from the transcript to drive the point home.\n\n(2) Also somewhat likely, but the attorney was looking for specific wording as others have suggested. Sometimes we\u2019re looking for a \u201csound bite.\u201d We want a clear question and answer so there is no ambiguity both for the jury and also for the transcript in case of a potential appeal. \n\n(3) He may be trying to draw more out of Depp. I can tell you from experience that nothing is more off-putting or disorienting to an attorney during a deposition or direct/cross examination than individuals who provide short, concise, and on point answers to questions. Think about taking an examination like a date. It\u2019s easy to get into a rhythm when there\u2019s a conversation going on between the two individuals. When the witness talks more or over elaborates, it gives you more time to think of your next question and also gives you more information to ask even further questions about. A person who gives short and concise answers, though, is a bad date. If you ask a girl on a first date \u201cso how was your day?\u201d and she says \u201cfine\u201d then you don\u2019t really have much to go on. The attorney may have been trying to draw him out to elaborate further, either out of frustration or confusion as to why he\u2019s being asked the same question multiple times.",

Just happened that i had the two big pot dealers from my town in the car at the time(yes, i had just given them a ride to re-up from their guy) but in the few moments before had to speak with the police we discussed and decided that when i stopped my car we were gonna step out of the car and lock the doors and stand right next to our respective doors. Nothing illegal about that but it does start the whole interaction with them wondering why we would do this. \n\nFast forward about 10 minutes and there are 4 cruisers and 6 officers for a basic traffic stop. The one who initially stopped me pulls me off away from the others and then proceeds to ask if can search my car.....\n\nOfficer- can i search your vehicle? \nMe- no you cannot \n\nOfficer- are you sure i can't search your vehicle? \nMe- yes I'm sure\n\nOfficer- so you don't want to us to search your vehicle? \nMe- no i don't want you to search my vehicle\n\nOfficer- so you are saying, that in no way you want us to search your vehicle? \nMe- yes I'm sure i don't want you to search my vehicle\n\n\n\nThis goes on for about 5 minutes before my friend goes \"damn, i just lost a bet with my father. I said you couldn't tell police they aren't allowed to search without probable cause\"\n\nThe officer looks at him, looks back at me and says \"i know why you don't want to us to search your car so you better get them home and the car off the road before i decide to write you up for no tail lights\"\n\n\nWas told they were doing that to hopefully get me to slip up and answer wrong to one of the questions so they could search my car. Wonder if it's the same thing here? Get Depp to just one time on record to answer that it wasn't his signature",

Semantics is about the meanings of words  not moving them around to have no meaning. If someone says 'that's just semantics\" in an argument - you've got a huge problem, because... if you have a semantic argument pn your hand, you're arguing different things and NEED to have an semantic arguments anyway.  Saying \"that's just semantics\" is never a way to dismiss an argument unless you're an asshole who doesn't know what semantics means. \n\nAnd if someone does want to continue an argument after arguing semantic differences - they aren't interested in the argument, they're interested in only bring perceived as correct or winning or submission... not for truth of an argument.\n\nThe issue with depp isn't a moving of words it's a question of clarifying the position of whether his signature was put there by himself. The very fact that the argument of forging a signature explicitly denies the implicit position that agreeing that it's \"his signature\" means \"I signed my signature\"... since a forgery of the could exist which is someone signing \"someone else's signature\", ie misrepresenting the style and name of the writing to obligate them without their intent or knowledge. Someone can forge \"my signature\"... that's the point. The existence of a signature is not a guarantee it was signed by the person. Saying \"yes that's my signature\" says - \"that is a signature that by all appearances is identical to the signature I write\", it is not \"I have explicitly signed this document with my signature\". Of course, signing a document doesn't also therefore imply consent anyway for a similar reason. I could hold a gun to your head and say sign the document, that's your signature by your own hand, likely without your consent (assuming you're not doing some machivellian shit to puppeteer the action to later dissolve responsibility.)",

And there are a lot of exceptions to the hearsay rule, where certain out-of-court statement more likely to be trustworthy are allowed. For example, \"Jim told me he deliberately drove into a bicyclist, killing him.\"\n\nMan, evidence was a fun class!",

I don't know what the document is or says, but whatever it is, it's probably not good for Depp. So the lawyer's idea is to keep reading pieces from the document, and after each piece, he makes Depp confirm again that, by signing, he was affirming that the thing he just read is true.\n\nSo here's a hypothetical example. Let's say (I'm completely making this up, just to demonstrate the point) that in 2016 Johnny Depp wrote a letter to Amber Heard apologizing for hitting her. The lawyer would first establish that the letter was actually from Depp, and that Depp signed it.  Then he would make Depp read it out loud, piece by piece. Hypothetical colloquy:\n\nLawyer: You wrote here that you were \"sorry for the way I yelled at you,\" right?\n\nDepp: Yes.\n\nLawyer: And then you wrote: \"I know I shouldn't have hit you last night.\" Right?\n\nDepp: Yes, that's what I wrote.\n\nLawyer: And again, you signed this letter, right?\n\nDepp: Yes.\n\nLawyer: Ok. In the next sentence in this letter, you say, \"I just get so angry sometimes.\" Correct?\n\nDepp: Yes.\n\nLawyer: Then you say: \"But I know it was wrong to hit you.\" Right?\n\nDepp: That's what it says there.\n\nLawyer: And those were your words, right?\n\nDepp: Yes.\n\nLawyer: Because you signed this letter, correct?\n\nDepp: For the third time, yes, I signed it.\n\nEtc....you get the point.",

You can see the judge state that it is of no relevance if Amber abused Depp (ruling out any possibility of self defence). You can see the judge look at texts in which Depp begs for help getting out of the house because Amber had hit him 10 times, and the judge states that he won't comment on this incident because Amber was not aware those texts exist and it wasn't fair to her. You can see the judge state that a woman who claims Amber abused her was \"lying out of spite due to Amber firing her\". You can see the judge take every word Amber and her friends say as truth, whilst stating that Johnny and his witnesses are lying because they are friends with each other. You can see the judge state that everything Amber says must be true because she stated so under oath and so she couldn't possibly lie. And if memory serves correctly (take this one with a pinch of salt) when given evidence of Amber admitting to abusing him, the judge decided she was \"being sarcastic\".\n\n> The judge has connections to both The Sun and Amber. Courts aren't always right. They need to be questioned and examined and scrutinized.",

So, for example, a judge wrongly allows a police report into evidence when the officer should have been called to testify because the defendant has a constitutional right to confront and cross-examine the accuser. Edit: I've worked on numerous high school mock trials and seen rulings by the judges go both ways on the same issue. I just scratch my head. I've also had around 400 jury trials where I view the variations in rulings to be much more political.",

It needs said outside of court, outside of the context of having them under oath. So testimony from this trial is not hearsay. And for the truth of the matter. If I use a statement to explain how I felt and my motivation, the truthfulness of the statement asserted itself doesn't really matter.\n\nThe complicated stuff comes from that third part, the truth of the matter and all the exceptions. Hopefully the first two elements of hearsay (whether it counts as a statement made by someone and whether its made in or out of court) are clearer.\n\nThe idea behind hearsay is like this. If I say x person told me about y thing. Why are you relying on me to relay that? Its better to get it from X person's mouth.\n\nThe other part about it is that the whole point of court is to get the truth out of witnesses by questioning them (under oath to not lie). If you can't get the person into court, its unfair to use their statements.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/jpcyi5/making\\_memes\\_instead\\_of\\_outlining\\_for\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/jpcyi5/making_memes_instead_of_outlining_for_the/)",

It means \"I heard someone say something about something that I didn't see.\" You didn't witness it yourself, but someone told you. That's hearsay and it's not generally admissible in court to give as testimony something that someone else told you. You have to have witnessed it yourself or the court would need to get the person who did on the stand. Mostly because the other person isn't the one under oath, so they don't have any obligation to have told you the truth. So what if you repeat hearsay, you might not be lying intentionally, but if the information you heard was wrong then it makes a big sticky mess and gives you plausible deniability to lie while avoiding repercussions by saying \"hey, that's what I heard.\"",

Can't actually hear what's being said in some parts, so the humor of the moment is lost to confusion. \n\n\nSide bar: I recently learned from someone on an IG reel comment that had a similar issue with the background music being too loud, that people do this on purpose so the viewer will watch it over and over trying to make out what is being said.

A few months later my friend and I got summoned to court to testify. \n\nWe were sitting outside the courtroom and some guy walked by and asked us each a few random small-talk type questions. We didn't really think anything of it. A few minutes later, the bailiff (or someone like that) came out and looked at the two of us and then asked my friend to come in to testify. \n\nAfter like 20 minutes my friend came out of the courtroom and was super sweaty and nervous. He said the questions they were asking got his brain all turned around and he couldn't get his words to come out right and he totally screwed everything up.\n\nIt turns out that the guy who talked to us in the hallway was the defense lawyer. The prosecution lawyer later told us that the reason he stopped to talk to us so he could gauge who might get more flustered under questioning and chose my friend instead of me. \n\nThe guy ended up being let go with time served (I believe he'd been in jail for about 30 days waiting for his court date) and either 1 or 2 years probation, I can't remember which. \n\nThat got a little longer than I planned but your comment reminded me of that experience that I had sort of forgotten.",

              "text": "I had to defend myself in an unemployment hearing to continue receiving that pay. I remained calm and respectful. The HR manager constantly interrupted me, made claims of a complaint letter that they couldn't find and that wasn't submitted during the discovery process (I'm 100% sure it was a lie), and even went so far as to yell at me. He even interrupted the person running the hearing. The former employer pushed it so far that I didn't get to submit my side of the case during our one hour allotment. I had so much ready to slam them with. Writeups because I would stop to snack occasionally (I get hypoglycemic easily), a writeup because I stopped to stretch while moving equipment (I have multiple back injuries), and one exceedingly ridiculous writeup where a coworker refused to help donors as she was playing with her phone. I told the supervisor and in the writeup *I* was written up saying I didn't keep up a required pace. No one can draw blood on 2 people simultaneously. I can prep the other person while the first is filling up the bag, but there is no reason to make that second person wait when the other employee is just playing with their phone avoiding work. She was one of the favorites, buddy buddy with a manager that was known for playing favorites. In the writeup lazy employee's own statement even admitted to playing with her phone and not helping. So they wrote me up for her incompetent behavior and it was all in the writeup, clear as day. There were a few others that I don't remember off the top of my head.    \n\nI waited for the reschedule but it never happened. I got worried and checked the letter that was sent a few days after the hearing. Turns out I misread it. They defaulted to siding with me even without hearing my statement. The former employer's volatile and inappropriate behavior contrasted with my calm collected demeanor only served to reinforce my side of the case. I think they must also have a record of this type of behavior from that company to make such a decision. It was quite satisfying in the end. Got me away from a toxic work environment and allowed me to progress my career after some other hurdles were dealt with.",

I explained that i was merely joking by repeating the same joke.

(which would be true) Then you say that you will disregard the other lawyers because they presented their thoughts through a YouTube video rather than a reddit comment like you?\n\nOther lawyers seem perfectly fine with youtube, having posted videos and everything. So clearly the \"dont take anything on youtube seriously\" is not a lawyer thing.

There was some audio/video/photo evidence where Depp came across as agitated and drug addicted but it wasn\u2019t particularly interesting. \n\nI thought cross was going to do better based on how they started yesterday so today was a surprise. Monday should be interesting though. The last evidence they entered was an audio recording of Depp potentially threatening to or trying to self harm. Amber doesn\u2019t come across well either though. She\u2019s heard suggesting he would need a sharper knife so I\u2019m sure Depp\u2019s team will fire back on that.",

The second is not... the reason for this is that if *you* say you saw what happened, the lawyers can question you further about that and try to find out if you're telling the truth or not. If you say *Kelly* saw it, the lawyers don't have the ability to question Kelly about what she actually saw, and we can't just take it on faith that her description of events is accurate, so it's not allowed as evidence.\n\nThere are exceptions of course, but this is the basic idea behind the rule.",

Neither of these events are isolated incidents, it seems like they were physically/verbally abusive to each other over a long period of time) but depending on what social media site you use, onlookers seem to think there's one person who is innocent. Reddit is in the camp that Depp is being framed and Heard is the only abuser.    \nThey both seem like they have issues and are now locked in a zero sum game and will probably continue this fight until one of them declares bankruptcy imo.",

Lawyer is attempting to pin depp with an affirmative statement. Depp has been advised by his lawyer to not actually give the opposition anything. Classic court BS that has to be done.\n\nHere-say: in court it\u2019s important because you cannot *prove* that that is what is being said. You want words? You have to have those words in writing or repeated from the person in front of the court of law. Essentially it\u2019s to stop \u201che said she said\u201d problems of what people did or did not say. It\u2019s why writing stuff down is fucking gold for court stuff.

The judge concluding he 'probably was abusive' in the first case did no one any real service, not him, not the law and not even her, ultimately. Neither of them should be negatively impacted professionally, based on this. Even if either were convicted of a particular criminal act, they still shouldn't be prevented from working unless something about their conduct actually impedes their ability to perform, or the safety of others. This is and should remain a private matter. The supplemental notion of social media 'justice' sitting separate to the courts is a growing illness in society. The same issue applies with people like Kevin Spacey and Geoffrey Rush.\n\nIn your example, I mentioned assuming such an accusation was sincere. I would not assume a rape accusation is sincere just because it was made, but would expect any person making such a claim to be treated as if it is, unless shown otherwise.

He confirmed that the article was earlier, and went even further talking about how he was sure Disney had been considering their options earlier.\n\nBut I could hear in the background someone saying \"Judge, this article is from the Daily Mail\". It's a fucking tabloid magazine.\n\nI'm sure we could find a thousand articles claiming the same with no basis in fact, even from more reputable sources than a tabloid rag.

A lawyer could show Weekly World News to a jury as proof that Bill Clinton shook hands with a space alien, and the jury is not even allowed to research it until the case is over.\n\nOur legal system has no filter in the age of misinformation.

And I was not suggesting the judge or jury would base their verdict on his dress, but instead could be influenced by it.\n\nIt's strategy. Humans will judge based on appearance, well i would make sure my appearance was neutral so to speak.  This is what attorneys tell you when you go to trial. it's why women, or smart women, don't wear mini skirts or cocktail dresses to court because people will make judgements about their appearance and that could influence the outcome.   Well its the same for men, only men aren't seen as \"sluts\" from their appearance but there are other wrong conclusions that can be attributed to appearance. \n\nand DUDE - a black man sits on the witness stand in a navy suit, white shirt, and nice tie.  Now take the exact same black man and same circumstances and put him in a white wife beater, a black hoodie, some gold chains around his neck  and tell me his appearance is NOT going to affect the jury/judge.  THAT IS MY POINT :-)",

Oh and I became a better witness very quickly.   \n\nAnyhow, Depp was poorly coached from what I can see.  \n\nI explained Depp's fashion choices in another reply in this thread. \n\nCourt is not a stage for a cool guy, or a cocktail party for a rich dude, nor is it a place to wear sunglasses inside or show your mad fashion skills. It's where you want to look innocent, act innocent, not piss off or frustrate the judge nor spar with the opposing attorney.  Judges hate that shit.  Rule number 1 - do not piss off the judge, you want the judge's sympathy, even if you lose.  Cos if you lose and the judge doesn't like you there aint gonna be any mercy. If you lose but the judge has some kind of respect for you, it till be less painful.",

I think a jury trial would be a bad move because both of these people are insufferable in their own way and the jury would not be sympathetic to either one.  A judge is trained to be objective, to the best of their abilities, so if I was her I would not have asked for a jury.  I mean a typical juror is making 45k a year, trying to feed his/her family, wondering how long their car will last before they need to buy another one meanwhile they are listening to super rich rockstars/movie stars saying \"you're a bitch\" \"no you're a bitch\" \"you suck\"\"no you suck\"  plus all the bed shitting drama, physical abuse, excess, drugs, etc.  If I was on the jury I'd be all fuck you both lol (joking)\n\nYeah a jury would not be the way to go on this one. Neither is very likeable or a sympathetic person, in terms of the case not in terms of their respective celebrity status.\n\nps: sorry I didn't just answer you with \"I don't know\" lol Court things fascinate me",

I hope it opens the eyes to more people how much of an issue this type of domestic abuse is. It's severely underreported but evidence point to it being very close to 50/50 more or less globally.",

D.' next to 4 lines of universally agreed cocaine. He was asked whether that box was used to store his cocaine, Depp said 'no'. During his testimony in the UK he did say that box belonged to him and was used to store cocaine.\n\nThis video only shows the highlight of Johnny Depp being comedic during cross examination.",
