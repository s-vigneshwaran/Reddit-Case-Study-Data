The article says that Japan is unusual in that about 100 years ago they changed away from their traditional approach and started writing their English-version names in the Western fashion: PersonalName FamilyName. Apparently in 2020 Japan officially changed it back to their traditional version.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* **Kim Jong-Un**: Family Name = Kim, Personal Name = Jong-Un\n* **Kim Il-Sung**: Family Name = Kim, Personal Name = Il-Sung\n* **Xi Jinping**: Family Name = Xi, Personal Name = Jinping\n* **Abe Shinzo**: Family Name = Abe, Personal Name = Shinzo",

Beg for me is a tense vowel, right on the edge of a diphthong and definitely not the same as \u201ceh.\u201d In my accent, the vowel in beg is very close to face or hay. Bet is the vowel sound that gets the closest to the Japanese for me. I think where we\u2019re getting our wires crossed is you seem to be focusing on lax vs tense, while I\u2019m focusing on monophthongs vs diphthongs. \n\nSince Japanese doesn\u2019t really have a phonemic distinction between tense and lax vowels the way English does, I wasn\u2019t really coming at it from that perspective. To my ear, the Japanese e\u031e (using IPA now to minimize confusion) does sound closer to the lax than the tense, but it\u2019s not a particularly important distinction. My main focus is the fact that it doesn\u2019t close to the \u026a the way English e\u026a does. Also, my Japanese teachers focused really hard on teaching us not to use diphthongs since that was probably the most common mistake we were making with vowels (other than rounding when they shouldn\u2019t be lol), so that may color my perception as well.",

If you don't speak Japanese distinguishing given names and family names isn't obvious. \n\nIf you really want to bake your noodle Abe the Japanese surname is pronounced differently from Abe the short form of Abraham. \n\nJaoanese Abe is pronounced ah-bay. Japanese vowels are pronounced a lot like Spanish ah, e, ou, ay, oh for a,i,u,e,o.\n\nWhich is why a lot of weeks wind up mispronouncing  the word anime. It's ah-knee-may not aaaa-knee-may. That nasal a we use in English like in \"and\" doesn't exist at all in Japanese.",

My OB just told me to eat less carbs and left it at that. \n\nLast summer I was having some other issues with iron, but my A1C came back in the higher 5s twice, which again if I was in the US is in pre-diabetes land but in Canada is not. \n\nI did proactively get a glucose monitor and my sugars are pretty normal, but I do have some trigger foods, like mashed potatoes, but pure sugar cake does not. \n\nI am currently going to be starting Saxenda (liraglutide) to try to get some of my excess weight off to see if that helps. Another reason I think I\u2019m dealing with insulin resistance is that the weight is just not coming off after my last child, and I did successfully lose weight after my first. \n\nSorry, I feel like I\u2019ve vented here a little too much, but I really do appreciate your comment and I totally agree between age/some pregnancy changes and blood sugars is why my vision is acting up.",

My prescription that I've had worsen since I was 9yo got .25 better which is a worse script than some people have with reading glasses. My partner's mom had a bunch of eye exercises docs gave her when she was going through chemo & they genuinely help. For instance the patterns game SET was one of the ones that they gave her & you just try to do them more quickly.",

It's under control, for the time being, but like almost all human eyes, there's a limited lifetime for \"really good vision\", and retinopathy sort shaves a few years off because, well, you know, diabetes is kind of a \"fuck you\" disease.  \n\nThe problem is basically that \"because diabetes\" blood vessels start growing inward toward the macula, which can (and will) either themselves start blocking vision, or bleed which will cause blurry vision, and lead to a host of other problems (including retinal detachment, for instance).  \n\nThe treatment is a process call \"pan-retinal photocoagulation\".  \n\nIn an outpatient fashion, the doctor fires up a green laser (I know it's green because I *saw* it), presses a focusing lens against your eyeball, has you lean forward into the slit-lamp thing, and then starts playing \"Space Invaders\" around the perimeter of your retina literally shooting blood vessels to make them stop growing inward.  \n\nYou can see the laser every time it fires.\n\nYou can _feel_ it burning in the back of your eyeball every time.  The laser fires very quickly, for a total of about 500 - 1,000 times per eye to get all the way around, in a series of 2 - 3 sessions.  \n\n It took one round of that torture to really drive home how important blood sugar control is.  The second two sessions I had get high as fuck, pop like 3 xanax and make someone else drive me.  Anything less and I'd just turn around and go home.",

The fact that we can define them as \"old people\" is part of the problem. \n\nThey're out of touch. MOST politicians on both sides of the fence are already at least a little out of touch since most did not grow up in a true \"working class\" household. Most never had to scrape by on meager paychecks, knowing that they have to move because the landlord has increased the rent again and they won't be able to afford it, but also having trouble finding a place that WILL rent because even the cheapest apartment requires 3x the monthly rent in income. They don't know the stress that millions and millions of Americans face when making the decision between food and gas. They can't understand that when our car breaks down, it's not always as easy as just \"oh, put it on my card.\" Or that when gas prices increase, we can't just buy an electric car to save money on gas. Neither side understands that because they haven't lived remotely close to it. And the farther they get up that bureaucratic totem pole, the farther out of touch they get. \n\nAnd then there's the age issue. Once people reach a certain age, their mental faculties generally start to decline. The rate of that decline obviously varies greatly, but that's only part of the problem. Have you seen how stuck in their ways most older people are? How hard it is for them to understand newer things? Not just technology, but societal norms, mindsets, changing political and economic situations? It wasn't until 2010 that I was able to get my mother, who was 60 at the time and is highly educated and very smart, that the Soviet Union was no longer a thing anymore. My father, at 70,  cannot comprehend the idea that 15 an hour is not actually a lot of money in the area I live. Neither of my parents get the fact that just because a lot of people are hiring doesn't mean that there are a lot of good job opportunities. I know, I know. Anecdotal evidence and all. But these are two of the smartest and most highly educated people I know, but there are some things they just can't grasp. \n\nPoint of all this is to say: I genuinely do not think any president or politician who grew up when overt racism and sexism wasn't just allowed but ENCOURAGED and has never known anything but comfort growing up will be very likely to have the best interests of the average American at heart, and we really ought to look into term limits for congress and changing the requirements to become a politician.",

And let's be clear: Biden is not a perfect president. He's arguably not even a great president, but he's worlds ahead compared to Trump. Yes, America deserves better. The US should get a genuinely great president. Right now a descent to a theocratic hellhole is unfortunately a realistic fear. Trump will try to run again and DeSantis is even worse, since he's actually competent compared to Trump. So, right now, it's entirely valid to compare a president to Trump and to be better than him. Again. The US deserves a great president, but beggars can't be choosers.\n\nHaving said all that, there is a lot that you can criticize Biden for, but attacking his speech is low. Especially since the right wing loves to use it as a popular attack while projecting Trump's failings unto Biden.",

They al come down to \"it's obviously silly because no one else believes this\". Everything, even Snopes, completely fails to put forward any kind of EVIDENCE. \n\nNone, NONE of the articles on the subject tell me what the demographics of people dying in their sleep in S Korea vs other nations.\n\nSince no one else shares this belief, no other countries would track \"fan deaths\" so how do you even compare? \n\nIt seems like a form of racism to just assume something is silly. Arguments of \"lots of people sleep with fans on their face and live\" are like argunents that say \"lots of people get covid and live\". Yeah. So? \n\nWe all know lots of babies are put on their stomach to sleep and don't die. We also know a small subsection DO. There are peoole walking around alive today because their parents put them on their back to sleep, even though most of us would have survived just fine in a crib with blankets and on our bellies. \n\nGood science doesn't work so dissmissively. \n\nThings I want to know, which maybe non-English sources could provide:\n\n1. Does Korea have an unusual rate of unexpected death while sleeping compared to other populations?\n\n2. Have any metastudies ever been done on this effect?\n\n3. Have \"fan deaths\" been studied by scientists to see if there are commonalities in the post mortem findings?\n\nI think it's most likely that fan death is a superstition based around heat-related death (someone who is too hot would point a fan at themselves right??) but we also can't rule out the possibility that S Korean populations have a genetic quirk, like SIDS babies, that make them more prone to fan death. Maybe there is even a correlation between SIDS and fan deaths in families. But all I can find are articles going \"fan death is a superstition\". \n\nIs it? Then why dies the government officially endorse it? South Korea isn't some backwater country. Surely if the government endorses this they have science behind it that white sources aren't discussing?\n\nThe whole thing seems very weird. Surely some basic demographic statistics should disprove it but I can't find any.",

If you read through all my answers, at NO point do I suggest that fans are a cause. \n\nI am a curious person who asks a lot of questions. My first  thoughts on hearing this superstition were:\n\n \"do people really die in their sleep in Korea?? Because that's virtually unheard of where I live except the very old and very young. I wonder if dying in your sleep is more common in South Korea than in Canada? Maybe it's due to hot weather in poor housing? We sure had a lot of heat deaths during that heat dome last year... but again that was mostly the very old and infirm... maybe it's like that thing in the Phillipines where people die in their sleep? Could it be the same thing?? Maybe it's kind of like SIDS and it's a combo of genetic and environmental factors? Or is it really nonexistant and a big hoax?\"\n\nLiterally, the above is a summary of my thoughts when I read about the superstition. So I googled it and found zero answers to my questions. So I posted my questions here and am getting downvoted for... what? Curiosity?\n\nYour rocks speaking french thing is nonsensical and mocks my basic curiosity about existing things (ie a widespread cultural belief). \n\nUnlike rocks speaking french there IS a known and scientifically accepted phenomenon of unexplained nocturnal deaths in south asian populations. \n\nUnlike rocks speaking french there IS a possibility that fans are getting the blame for a genuine phenomenon that could have a real scientific basis, such a genetic propensity or environmental factors. Unlike rocks speaking french, there is a genuine posibility that lives could be saved. \n\nAlso if an entire country did believe rocks speak french I would absolutely ask \"well has anyone spoken french to see? Maybe that kind of rock type echos certain consonant combinations better than others...\"\n\nBecause I'm curious.\n\nSo \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

You ask for statistics, but statistics are inherently uncertain, and I think you and I know you are not going to get any sort of confirmation that rises above the level of uncertainty anyhow so fundamentally the application would be fruitless \n\nAgain\u2026 there has to be plausiblity. You said the rocks example is no good, but every one of your counter examples denies the premise of francophone rocks, while you simultaneously beg the question of possible fan deaths. Fan death research can only potentially save lives if we suppose that it\u2019s a real phenomenon. I can just as easily say speaking rocks could save lives if they could give you helpful dietary advice or warn you of nearby dangers.",

You\u2019re confusing childlike wonder with scientific curiosity. \n\nYour points are all entirely false and based on your inability to read what people are telling you. You are twisting multiple responses into your own narrative:\n\n1.\tliterally nobody is doubting SUNDs or the possibility that heat prostration may be a cause. We are denying fan death as a premise, and you are off on a completely different subject, trying desperately to tie them together. You are working entirely backwards. We believe the heat theory\u2026 it refutes the fan theory. We are only denying the fan theory, not heat prostration. Your first point is entirely invalid.\n\n2.\tThis is the same as point one. I *strongly* believe the cause is SUNDs, that they incorrectly attribute this to fans, and are worthy of mockery for such an asinine and falsifiable belief. Your second point is invalid\n3.\tAgain\u2026 the same exact point. And invalid\n4.\tYou have fundamentally misdiagnosed what people are saying, and playing a victim. Your fourth point is embarrassing.\n\n\nIf you do get data verifying fan death is completely real and is in fact the reason behind SUNDs and not the other way around I will build a statue in your honor in the town square. If you merely mean you find SUNDs affects Koreans perhaps as much as studies show for people of the Philippines then nobody will be surprised. In fact casual googling shows several studies, in Korean as well as English, purporting exactly that. \n\nStop for a second and look at the comments and see that they are directed not on your wild side tangent about the possibility of a real problem that is being misattributed *to* fan death, but are targeted specifically at that being a preposterous notion, regardless of there may be a real and tragic unexplained medical phenomenon as an impetuous to concoct such an explanation.

But for something like this, you have entirely too many variables for even those death statistics to be correlated to anything meaningful.\n\nLet's just say you had data on the time of death for every death certificate in South Korea, and similar sets for every other country on earth.  Go even further and assume that South Korea had a statistically significant increase in overnight deaths, when compared against either the global average or other comparable countries.  Do you think the presence or absence of a fan would be noted anywhere in that data? Along with everything else you'd have to control for - room dimensions, local weather, fan speed, relative fan position, absolute fan location, duration of fan exposure, fan oscillation characteristics, demographic and medical factors, and a million other things?\n\nBecause again, you simply MUST come back to the simple, basic question of the harm vector. By what specific mechanism is it even remotely possible for the presence of a fan to be harmful in *any* way?  Aside from electrocution and amputation due to direct physical contact, you'd still have to have some effect that conforms to the laws of physics.  A fan doesn't doesn't have any effect on the surrounding environment that couldn't also be accomplished by opening a window on a breezy night.\n\nThe only explanation I found with a quick Google search that even attempted to ascribe this to some physical phenomenon suggested that the presence of the small electric motor was putting out some sort of EM field that interfered with people's hearts. To which I say, that is clearly absolute poppycock - any reasonable person can simply look around for a thousand examples of why that is so insane.  If we were susceptible in any way to field strengths that minute, we'd all be dead by now a hundred times over.\n\nHowever, you don't even have to use logic or reason, because there ARE many scientific and medical studies on exactly that topic, and they've rigorously tested the threshold at which there is any impact on humans.  Everyone from NASA to your local power plant and radio station has to know exactly what sort of EM transmissions can have medically significant impacts on humans.  Do you think every single one of those studies is wrong?\n\nSo unless that is your position, or you have some other non-mystical explanation, I really think your fan question is very easily resolved with information that is already readily available.",

What people believe and what is true often have no real correlation. It isn't scientific evidence. Science is not determined by majority opinion. So yeah, the weirdness of the superstition makes it unlikely to have any merit but that's not science. \n\n2. No one needs to do controlled studies. Like I said, a quick check of demographic statistics should show whether Koreans suffer sudden death in sleep at a different rate from those who commonly sleep with fans on their face. That should be quite sufficient. \n\nPersonally my theory is that fan death could be a matter of heat death. People who are overheated are likely to point fans at themselves right? Seems like an easy basis for the superstition. In which case a quick look at post mortems of fan deaths should show whether my theory has merit or not.",

But the grid theory makes sense too \ud83e\udd14 Again, as I said this should be easy to figure out based on demographics of unexpected sleep deaths. If Korea has no higher rate if unexpected death in sleep than, say, Canada, then I think it would have to be a government hoax. \n\nBut I know that in the Philippines there is a syndrome called Sudden Nocturnal Death Syndrome where people die suddenly in their sleep.

You can't say \"Prove that it has never killed anyone\", that's obviously an impossible task. \n\nSo if you think that fans kill people, find a source, or do the research.

The question is not \"is this superstition true?\" Because that's impossible really to answer when phrases like that. Think of stories of cats sucking babies' breath when it's clearly a matter if cats sleeping on babies' chest leading to SIDS. Like yeah cat in crib is bad idea but not because of paranormal cat powers. \n\nMy question is,\n\n\"Is there an endemic problem of people dying in their sleep in Korea, often while fans are pointed at them? And if so, why?\" \n\nScience doesn't dismiss things out of hand. Science asks questions and looks for answers. \n\nSo, does Korea have a provlem with otherwise young and healthy people dying in their sleep? Because that's possible. It's actually a common problem in South Asian populations and we don't know why yet. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404490/\n\nThen, if the answer to the first questjon is yes, my question becomes \"in cases of sudden nocturnal death, what is the percentage of people who have fans on them at night?\" If the answer is a large percentage I would ask \"is this a statistically significant percentage compared to the regular population?\" \n\nThese three questions in themselves could give us some clues. If sudden nocturnal death is higher in the phillipines where noone fears fans, than in Korean populations where people do fear fans, then is that coincidental or correlated? \n\nIf, say, (totally imaginary statistics here) 90% of SUNDS victims have fans on them at night, regardless of country, and yet 75% of Phillipinos sleep with fans while only 25% of S Koreans, do, then now we have discovered something significant. \n\nIf that were the case I would THEN ask, \"has anyone run longitudinal studies of people who sleep with fans routinely and people who don't? And can we compare rates of SUNDS in both populations over time?\" \n\nBy contrast, let's imagine different statistics. What if South Korea has the same rate of SUNDS as the Philipinnes does but tallies them differently as \"fan deaths\"? \n\nOr what if the number of SUNDS cases is completely unrelated to fans? In which case we can theorize that fans are being falsely blamed for SUNDS cases. \n\nAnd of course what other commonalities exist? Do these deaths tend to occur on very hot nights? Do post mortema show signs of heat stroke? So many questions to be asked.",

I'm seeing a decent pitch for a K-Drama, some weird ghost from the animistic trend that is pretty popular right now. \n\nSometime in the early post-war era, some guy/girl who is from a lineage of shamans  is stuck in an untenable situation of saving a family member from the orwelian fascistic dictatorship from being killed with a fan, at night, and fails.  This family member turns out to be our villain, and is communing with an even angrier spirit of an ancestor who is well known as the evil progenitor of this chaebol family that has ties to the yangban societies that happily gave their allegiance to  Imperial Japan during the Occupation. In his anger at being killed, by a fan no less, his frustrated ghost rampages across in Korea in a soju fuelled shotgun of violence, wavering between the land of the living, and the land of those in-between. \n\nHis ghastly method of crossing back into our world? \n\nA running fan at night. \n\nNow we flash forward to today, people still dying from fans. The descendant of the person who killed him in the first place (don't forget the shaman lineage), becomes interested in the whole 'fan-death' theory. They follow a trail of bread crumbs that lead to a to a story involving the first documented fan death: Their great uncle.\n\n\nThey then research into the uncle, find out he's a total bastard, dig further, find out grand dad way back was a traitorous crazy immortality obsessed shaman hoping to use Japanese magic to achieve his goals.\n\nBy luck, find a branch of the family that still keeps the shaman tradition alive, and holds the lore of the family. From this interaction and an emotional moment reminding them of the responsibility they hold, they embrace their destiny. \n\n After an episode or two of learning the ropes of being a shaman, they make a discovery!\n\nThe ghost of the crazy uncle is using fans left on at night to suck the life force from his victims so  he can return to his corporeal form! No-one in the whole of South Korea is safe from this ghoulish undead fan spirit!\n\nTune in next week to find out what our hero will do!",

Whereas, in Japan, where social hierarchy is much stricter, co-workers don't foster that kind of relationship to begin with so they communicate on a last name basis?\n\nHad there been a more pronounced hierarchy in American workplaces, I'm sure even you'd call your co-workers by their last names with Mr / Ms, just as you'd do with an exec maybe. Right?\n\nSo technically the formality of using last names still exist in both places. It's just that formality is more prevalent in all aspects of life in Japan.",

And in politics, I honestly usually see them being referred to with both first and last name.\n\nin sweden it really feels like a matter of ease of identification, instead of a courtesy-based system. in the workplace youll likely only have one person named \"Johan\" so you can just use that cause theyll respond to that more naturally. But in politics or sports there may be a lot of Johans out there, so using last name to identify them is likely more effective.",

This weird scenario where a Japanese person asks you to use their family name as a first name isn't going to happen.\n\nYour name wouldn't get reversed unless you were physically in Japan, and even then, there's a cultural imbalance in the world where Japanese culture isn't so well known. Reverse it there.\n\nAny \"if they asked me to\" is just trying to show off that you know a fact about Asian culture in general for a scenario that isn't going to happen.

This is in contrast with Chinese folks, who typically still use the surname first, and personal name last, even when written in English.\n\nedit: Others linked this, but it appears now Japan is moving towards surname first in English:\n\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2020/09/abe-shinzo-or-shinzo-abe-whats-in-a-name/\n\nBut big deal... It's a recent change and customs for awhile have been personal name first, surname last in English. I'm cool respecting Japanese culture but it's going to take a few more years to get the habit ingrained. Personally, I'll try to use the surname first going forward but I am sure I will lapse into misusing it.",

From the Left, I'm being sarcastic saying it. Which is funny, cause I'm told daily in the media that he's doing a great job. Most votes in history, not a single scandal or mistake. Just a glowing score from every one. So is he not the best then? I keep asking for clarification, but all I get is hate or like you, I must be the enemy. \n\nOn the right, it's equal hate. One sentence and I'm a leftist commie. I'm the enemy...\n\nSee? I'm the enemy of both sides, because both sides are fucking stupid sheep who only think in their own terms. Only care, about thier own concerns, only hate those who disagree. \n\nMy motivations we're quite simple. To expose just how simple it is, to make social media users mad. One simple sentence. No derision, no nuance, no trick of the words. Just one simple sentence, to expose just how simple the mind is.",

This made you seem like you were trying to make people who voted for Biden out to be a cult, I appreciate the social experiment, but this is probably not the way to go about it",
