  "text": "TIFU by sending a call from the International Space Station to voicemail\nThis happened two days ago (Sunday). A friend of mine is currently on his second mission to the ISS. I saw a call come in on my iPhone and the caller ID said \u201cUs Gov.\u201d I first had that thought / feeling you get when the principal calls you to their office. \u201cCrap. What did I do that I thought I got away with but maybe I didn\u2019t?!\u201d I was in the middle of something with a bunch of people and showed them what it said on my phone and everyone was all \"Don't answer it!\" Between everyone's suggestion and my gut feeling of being in trouble, I sent it to voicemail. Turns out it was my buddy calling from SPACE. I had a chance to speak to someone that wasn't on Earth and screwed it up. First thing he said in the voicemail was \u201cYou probably saw a call from Us Gov and turned it down.\u201d I know he\u2019ll call again, but damn I feel like an idiot right now.\n\nTL;DR My buddy called me from the Iinternational Space Station and the caller ID said \u201cUs Gov\u201d so I sent it to voicemail and missed a call from space.\n\nEdit: He called back tonight! What a fascinating and amazing call! I asked where he was flying over and he said the Western coast of Africa. I asked how the ride was and he said smooth and awesome. He said the second stage acceleration was incredible and that they hit over 4Gs, then at SECO they got thrown into their straps from the deceleration, and bam\u2026orbit. Took roughly 8.5 min to get into orbit. They have a couple of days off (not because of Memorial Day). The conversation was 12 minutes long but we had to end it because of a satellite issue that was about to happens (exact reason is out of my wheelhouse). Ironically, I made him and I laser engraved rocks glasses and I was drinking out of it when he called. We also joked about some funny stuff that happened when I went out for the launch. He was cracking up about the situation with the first call that I shared here and said that\u2019s a common occurrence :)",

A day there is 1.77 of an Earth one. That's not going to mesh well, so either they make life there a living hell to conform to Earth ones (having a day and night cycle that long is already going to be hell, since we're made for 24h days), or they decouple entirely and it becomes entirely up to electronic systems to know how time zones fit together everywhere.",

Nobody had to go into the field to replace an antenna.\n\nOf course it makes sense to charge for it, so that they can invest in new tech for the future and because it made phones more popular so they did eventually have to grow the infrastructure, but the cost of a text was usually equal to one minute of call time. Call time was at that point a much bigger factor in how much infrastructure was needed than a text, so that price must have been based purely on what they thought the market value of a text message was.",

The acccess was traced back to the ISS. However once the investigation was concluded Ms. Worden was charged with two counts of lying to federal authorities because as it turned out she never actually withdrew permission for Ms. McClain to access the account and improperly stated to investigators that she had changed account password earlier than she had actually done. This meant that the old password McClain knew was still valid at the time she accessed the account, in essence accessing the accounts with Ms. Worden's permission.\n\n**However:** I can't actually find the source that the caller ID and IP addresses trace back to NASA through which it is routed.\n\n---\n\nSo here's a source about an astronaut accidentially calling 911 from space:\n\nhttps://futurism.com/the-byte/astronaut-accidentally-dials-911-in-space-iss\n\nI am still working on a source for the internet access being routed through NASA.

While astronauts have a lot to do, they do get down time. Especially if you consider that they are up there for around 6 months. Having them on a schedule without time to decompress and relax for that amount of time is a recipe for disaster.",

If you WANT people to be unclear about what you mean in situations where your sarcasm isn't super clear, then sure, never use /s. I delve more into why it's important below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The /s is boring**\n\nQuestion marks at the end of sentences are boring too, but they don't get in the way of anything and can help understanding things, even if sometimes you'd have to be stupid not to understand something is a question. \"What time is it\" is very clearly a question with or without the question mark, while \"You're a stripper\" can either be a question or a statement so the question mark is needed. /s is pretty much exactly like that. Which is why I think the below statement is stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Adding it for some stupid people is stupid**\n\nHere's an example for you. Say I hop in a discord server where people debate things. There's 2 opposing sides coming at each other with several people jumping in. One person from one side could say something sarcastically that the other side means sincerely. If you don't know this person well enough to know their thoughts on the matter, it can be a coin flip whether or not they're being sarcastic, and in situations like that, would you really call someone stupid for not knowing whether or not they were being sarcastic? I'd also fight against the idea that it's \"some\" people in this case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo be clear, I think the /s that started this was unnecessary, but I feel like you're being overly critical of /s when it's just a tool that's used to aid in communication.",

Onboard was the Russian Oleg Kononenko, Japanese Kimiya Yui and the American Kjell Lindgren.\n\nLindgren, who represents NASA on his voyage, has roots in Sk\u00e5ne and is a descendant to Sam Dahl, a priest of Osby, according to Sk\u00e5nska Dagbladet. When they reached Kjell Lindgren he tells them that he hasn't spent much time in Sweden despite his roots but that he's well aware of them.\n\nThe swedish astronaut Christer Fuglesang, among others, have wished him good luck on Twitter: \"Probably the most swedish name in space ever. I say: Good luck, Kjell!\", writes Fuglesang.\n\nThe delayed launch of the space shuttle Soyuz was successful. If everything goes according to plan then the three astronauts will be onboard the international space station ISS (sic) early morning on Thursday Swedish time, since the expected travel time is about six hours.\n\nThe trio has been active on social media in preparation of the voyage, and among other things it's been brought to light that they're all \"Star wars\"-fans. They're using the robot R2D2 from the movies as an indicator for weightlessness in the shuttle, and NASA has even published an image in which they appear with light sabers.\n\nIn an interview with StarWars.com Lindgren tells that he saw \"A New Hope\" as a child and that the movie series is one of the reasons that he gained an interest in space. He also recounts that he himself has met David Prowse who plays Darth Vader in the original trilogy.\n\nNow we hope that the force will accompany the crew on the Soyuz all the way to the ISS.",

I find out that astronaut Mike Finke is from the region and that he took a Terrible Towel with him to the ISS. So I suggest we reach out to NASA to see if we could interview him from space. Everyone laughed at me, which made me more determined to make this happen. I don\u2019t know how I did it, but I got NASA to agree to a call and even offered us video. I then had to call the ISS, which involved having our engineer reposition our satellite for the call, which was super awesome and nerve wracking at the same time. So yeah, I got to call the ISS and talk to three astronauts in space. \n\n[here\u2019s the link of the video](https://youtu.be/5Cvw31XwoFQ)",

NO ONE, THAT\u2019S WHO.  \n\nWho sees \u201cUS Government\u201d on the caller ID and thinks to themselves, \u201cGee, what a lovely surprise!  I bet this will be a delightful conversation!  I should stop what I am doing right now, and happily answer this.  I\u2019ll happily stop in the middle of my workday.\u201d\n\nNo way dude.  I\u2019d be thinking, \u201cOMFG WHAT COULD THE US GOVERNMENT POSSIBLY WANT WITH ME?!?!?  I\u2019M DEAD.  I\u2019M GOING TO PRISON FOR SURE.  What did I even do???  Maybe the IRS is going to audit me for tax fraud\u2014dammit I KNEW I shouldn\u2019t have tried to write off my startup expenses on my taxes\u2026. Or wait\u2026maybe I accidentally smuggled drugs over the border on my vacation last month???  Is it even possible???  OMG YES IT IS!  That is the plot of Orange Is The New Black!  OMG I accidentally smuggled drugs, probably someone put them in my luggage when I wasn\u2019t looking\u2014OMFG I\u2019m going to die in prison\u2014OMG wait what if it wasn\u2019t me.  What if one of my friends committed a crime and now I\u2019m going to be called to testify at their trial in front of a grand jury\u2014who the fuck could it be\u2014Kyle\u2014dammit I bet it was you Kyle!\u2014you bastard, I kept telling you go easy on the bath salts mixed with Ketamine but nooooooo\u2026 you said it helped you concentrate on driving your public bus\u2026. OMFG WHAT COULD THE US GOVERNMENT POSSIBLY WANT WITH ME???  *THIS CAN ONLY BE BAD*.  I WILL DEAL WITH THIS LATER.  DECLINE DECLINE DECLINE.\u201d\n\nSo\u2026..who\u2019s fault is it, really? Did they really expect you to answer that call???\n\nThe US Government can spring the money for a damn rocket ship to space\u2014but they CANNOT spring the extra $25 a month to add a separate phone line with separate caller ID???? \n\nOr maybe they can afford it, but then they couldn\u2019t figure out how to do it?  After all, adding another phone line is so damn difficult, right?  You have to spend a whole 20 minutes calling the phone company and everything.  Or have a damn IT department, and the US Government doesn\u2019t have one of those.  Gee.

From inside the cockpit it blinds absolutely everything and that\u2019s not a good recipe for something carrying thousands of pounds of passengers or cargo. And don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m under the impression you do that or that pointing lasers in the air at all is irresponsible or something. Your comment just made me think of it and it\u2019s something many people don\u2019t consider. In fact a lot who have been in trouble for it never even knew the situation so I\u2019m just trying to spread awareness. You\u2019re absolutely right flights are pretty easy to track, all I\u2019m trying to add is two takeaways: if you\u2019ve never thought about it before, and most people never have reason to, shining a laser at a plane is a felony and despite whatever reports you read planes can be anywhere at any time and lasers can have a longer effective range than some people might realize. It\u2019s just an assumption of risk thing and whether what you\u2019re trying to do might be worth it if there\u2019s a plane you\u2019re unaware of in the area. Remember there can also be little GA aircraft that could be much harder to spot up there too\u2026\n\nhttps://youtu.be/J1xdgE4xz-o",
