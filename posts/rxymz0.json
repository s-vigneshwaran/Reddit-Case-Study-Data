It was typically just the 8 students (4v4), the substitutions (usually 2-3 people), moderator, coaches, and whatever small amount of parents who woke up early on a weekend who decided watching paint dry at home was too exciting. I wouldn't say we were amazing, but not terrible. But a small classroom with no one there was pretty alright.\n\nWe were invited to do a televised quiz show by a nearby university. It wasn't a major production, but man did that camera in the face just make me lock up. It took a while to get used to it. And that was also just a tiny studio with no audience.\n\nI also did a history bowl at a convention center. They set it up so it was like half of a basketball court for the quiz bowl and they just did one team at a time. The first few games it was pretty empty. That big space with no one in it was pretty unsettling. By the final round, the seats were pretty full and it was now unsettling in a different way.\n\nIt's easy to make fun of them from behind a keyboard, but I totally get how some people can just lock up or say something really dumb in a weird environment doing something pretty stressful.",

Continents are based of tectonic plates, you can see central America is on its plate and should be its own continent, that would help with avoiding confusion. Same with India, and the middle east. \n\nCentral America is part of the North American continent. \n\nYes because Europeans are from the same continent. \n\nThats why Middle Eastern people say they are from the Middle East and not usually Asia. Its for the purpose of avoiding confusion and distinguishing yourself to a region that most represents your identity. \n\nThis is not a white person problem, don\u2019t be racist.

There is actually a canal in Nicaragua so technically there is no longer a  land bridge. \n\nThe purpose of saying where you are from is for purpose of communication, large enough groupings of people and area into the language of grouping totally diminishes the whole reason for doing so. This is why you are objectively wrong.",
