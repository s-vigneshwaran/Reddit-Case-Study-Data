The surface make the water moves so fast that the pressure drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid and cause a void. The void rapidly collapses causing a shockwave. This happens because as fluid speed increases pressure drops. The fluid then rapidly loses speed as it leaves the surface and the bubble of vapor collapses. \n\nAs to your question: Water vapor is compressible. There is probably some very small change in water column height but it is likely very small.",

The Hawaiians called the fish that because when caught they would swim so fast that the fishing line would start to smoke as it ran over the gunwhale of the boat. \n\nThis is a small ahi. Full grown, they exceed 7' in length and 400 lbs. Small compared to their cousin the bluefin tuna, an apex predator that reaches nearly 900 lbs and 50 years of age, but still big enough to be a serious threat to their prey. \n\nTwenty something years ago, some unlucky bastard, a newlywed, rolled his rented kayak several miles offshore from where I lived. With no means of communication, he was in the water all night and succumbed to the cold. When the Coasties finally located and hauled him, he'd been chewed up pretty bad, but little deep bites, not like a shark. Nobody knows for sure obviously, but most folks on the island suspected yellow fin. I never thought about them the same way after that.",

Well one year, she comes waltzing out with FOUR cubs. Amazing. What\u2019s not so amazing is the level of confidence people just feel taking pictures of animals as if they\u2019re at the zoo or aquarium. \n\nI go out after work one night around dinner time (mamma bear is on a strict feeding schedule) and sure enough she\u2019s walking the bank with babies in tow. There\u2019s probably 20 RVS in the parking lot and maybe dozens of cars and 100 people just *flash *flash. No big deal, they\u2019re back far enough on a hill, she\u2019s famished, and she\u2019s pretty used to seeing bipedal dipshits cooing over her. \n\nAnd then, a Darwin Award. I overhear someone go \u201comg that man is going to feed her\u201d and I think, surely, I overheard wrong, there\u2019s no way man. I look down about 500 yards to my left and sure enough, there\u2019s a man, salmon in hand, outwardly dangling this thing and walking towards her and all her cubs. \n\nI won\u2019t lie, my first thought was, that guys an idiot, he deserves what\u2019s coming. But being a wildlife professional for so many years (not bears) I immediately acknowledge that when, not if, that man gets mauled, she and her 4 cubs are being put down by the authorities. That\u2019s common practice in these scenarios. \n\nI literally start throwing rocks from the top of the hill at him and heckling him. At one point I think I yelled \u201cdo you run 35 miles an hour you idiot?\u201d Lol dumb but it\u2019s all I could get out. Everyone else? Stood behind me and *flash *flash *flash. \n\nI\u2019d like to think I saved 5 bears that day. The man? Probably fell into a zoo enclosure shortly after.",

Relative to some rock flying through space somewhere we are also exepriencing a 1000g acceleration. This is just as real as the acceleration experienced by the fish in the original post.",

It's difficult to visualise because being subjected to a body force that doesn't also produce a surface reaction force essentially means that you're in freefall, and most humans don't spend a significant amount of time in such a state; however, there is no mechanism by which a uniform body force alone can cause damage.\n\nAs an example, imagine you're in space above a giant planet that has no atmosphere or radiation emission, but the planet is massive enough that you experience 1000g of acceleration.  Then you'll be safe during your freefall toward the planet (though you'd go splat upon landing), but you wouldn't be able to stand on the planet because you'd be crushed due to the reaction force.  The former is the effect of a body force, the latter is the effect of a surface force.",

So I know for a fact *he* left during sleepovers... and I don't think any other staff came in. I... just realized how odd this all is. You can have sleepovers at the aquarium and there's nobody from the damn place even there. I'm gonna have to ask him now",

I have been a rude bitch on more than one occasion by asking if someone was having a hard time reading the \u201cno flash photography\u201d signs. \n\nAnyway, hands down the best aquarium in the US and maybe the world.

Lastly, because of the aforementioned cellphone mode, handheld and larger digital cameras are able to shoot in low light situations too, who the hell uses a flash these days unless you're shooting a wedding or some other kind of party/event and you really do need that extra light. That tuna didn't have to die, someone doesn't know how to use their device properly. Just my opinion, don't have to jump all over me if you disagree.",

On most modern digital cameras, it's usually recommended that you don't use your \"pop-up\" flash and that you at least use an external flash. I guess I'm not really answering your question. Maybe it's just force of habit or what people are accustomed to? Also depends on what mode you're shooting in. If you're shooting in A mode on any digital camera, then it automatically enables the flash in low light settings  but if you use anything in program mode settings or above, such as Program Mode, Shutter Prority, Aperture Priority, or Full Manual mode,  usual the flash is disabled unless you in able it. You usually have similar modes, sort of, on your cellphone, you just need to look for them. Hope this helped some.",

I now have one of the most advanced phones on the planet with that function built into it and I'm interested to see what it can do.\n\nLet's break this down. We're not dismissing the low-light capability of a cell phone here in some situations.\nBut we need to know how it works. You mentioned \"most phone cameras have settings for low light situations like this\",\nthis is likely referring to a mode that the phone shots a lot of frames in a burst and then align them and take averages of them.\ni.e. it is almost like doing long exposure, except that normally in handheld long exposure you'd get motion blur\n(where the motion comes from your hand in this case). Here instead it is taking a lot of sharp (no motion blur) but noisy photos\nthen align them (so that your handheld motion is minimized), and possibly detecting movements and mask them out\n(to remove motion blur from actually moving objects as you are now effectively taking a long exposure),\nand then average it to reduce the noise (just as long exposure would.)\n\nSo if you do that in an aquarium, the moving creatures (mostly fish) would be either blurred if this is done naively by motion blur,\nor noisy as the algorithm is detecting that there's motion and they mask them out before averaging.\n\n> As for the smaller sensor argument, isn't that the way things are going anyways? We're not tying to make larger sensors. In the 80s we thought the future was going to be bigger and bolder the 90s came along and showed us that the future was going to shrink things down and minimize lots many aspects of life.\n\nI'm not sure what your argument is here.\nBefore going further, let's layout the basics first,\nthe resultant noise level is determined by the size of the sensor, aperture size, and shutter speed.\n\nLet's make some assumptions first.\nWe assume sensor size scales perfectly.\nWhat this statement means is that if there's a sensor twice as small\n(which is twice as dense given same megapixels),\nand somehow you can gather the same amount of light that were going to shine on the fat pixel in the original sensor\nto now shine on the twice as small pixel,\nthen they should have the same noise performance.\n\nThis is not a perfect assumption as there's other electronics on sensors.\nBut this assumption is practically correct if you use the scientific data measured by DxOMark.com\n\nAssuming we are talking about the same view of field (a.k.a. effective focal length such as 28mm equiv.),\nthe first 2 factors (sensor size and aperture size) can be combined to a single number: the physical aperature size, the larger, the more light onto the sensor, the lesser noise.\n\nIn all of our discussion, we should keep shutter speed constant,\nbecause if you are shooting a 1 second shot on the phone, you should also be shooting a 1s shot on the camera (say with a tripod.)\nYou might say this is not a fair comparison as the phone can do it handheld,\nbut assuming you have moving creatures, you probably want to shoot at 1/30s or even shorter, now that handheld long exposure factor is gone.\n\nThen now just look at the size of the physical aperature on your phone, and then that on your camera,\nI bet the one from the camera is much larger.\nIf it is 5x larger in diameter, then the light gathering power is 25x larger.\n\nSo by the law of physics, the one with larger sensor wins.\nTechnically the camera+lens combination wins, usually the larger the sensor size, the bigger the physical aperature,\nwhich is not always true as you move from Full Frame to medium format, the largest Full Frame lens (say F1.4) often has larger physical aperature comparing to those available in the medium format market.\n\nSo you are correct that there were some point in the history that they keep goes larger (when still using film)\nbut now the smaller sensors wins, by smaller we mean full frame, because that's the format you can now buy a lens with the largest physical aperature size (given same field of view.)\n\nP.S. above is claiming scientifically the smaller sensors on smart phone will never win those from an actual interchangable lens camera.\nWhether the quality from the smaller sensors is good enough is another story. That depends on viewing conditions, how well-lit, how much is moving fast, etc.\nIn practice \"good enough\" is good enough, and depending on the situation, even if you pick the best camera avaiable, it is difficult to get a \"good enough\" quality.\nThe lighting condition I've in mind for what an aquarium would looks like probably also is a lot dimmer than you're thinking too.\n\nBy my eyeball guesstimate from the video in the OP, it is a very tough situation as I said before, low light, fast moving objects, reflection surfaces, etc.\nIt's very hard to get a non-blurry photo out of that situation. But torrelance of blurriness is also subjective espcially given most viewing condition nowadays are social networks.",

For some of the more sensitive species like octopuses and assorted deep-sea creatures we had to have someone stand there and tell people not to use flash. Even though there were MULTIPLE signs.

Once you actually tell them, they always apologize and fix it. People are just flat out unaware of their surroundings. Especially when they're on vacation and have a million other things on their mind. Which isn't an excuse, and the animals suffer from these people's stupidity. But it's not malicious. One of my current jobs (at a different facility) is to tell every group that comes in the place that there are no dolphin shows. Directly after they walk past two different signs that also tell them that. And even after I tell this to literally every group, people sit by the dolphin exhibit for half an hour then come over and ask me when the show starts.\n\nAnyway, if people read signs I'd be out of a job.",

I think this was taken at the Osaka Aquarium - easy to narrow down because there are only a couple places with whale sharks - and I'm not very familiar with how Japan runs their aquariums. However, at aquariums in the US (at least the good ones) every animal that dies goes through a full necropsy and is then disposed of as biological waste. Animals in these facilities are regularly given lots of medications (for example, antibiotics) and veterinary care that'd make them unfit for consumption, especially by humans. I'm not super familiar with this side of things, but food given to animals at aquariums is regulated by the FDA and generally needs to be the same quality that could be fed to humans. Which makes me think they wouldn't feed it to the other animals either.\n\nAgain, this is just based on what I know about facilities in the US. Perhaps things are different in Japan. But a well-respected place like the Osaka Aquarium is likely to follow protocol something like this.",

I would view it similar to having a wristband at an event. Sure, you can get around not having one, especially in a big crowd. But it helps the organizers a ton.\n\nI'm also pretty sure that a solid 50%+ of people over 50 don't even know how to turn their flash off.

On the way out they check your stickers and if they say VOID that's straight to jail for you. \n\nIs it possible to scale this up and have someone at the exit of the museum checking stickers? Probably, but seems very difficult is practice. How do you know who has a phone camera and who doesn't? Sure, most people do, but some still don't. In a government building it is recorded what phone I came in with, but a museum can't do that. You could just lie and say you never brought a phone in. \n\nThe best thing about the sticker in a museum is it *deters*. You can never regulate 100% of humans. Humans are dumb and selfish. But at least the stickers eliminate accidents and make many people second guess themselves. Plus you can make penalties way harsher because the warning is so much clearer.",

Also, people will just take it off because they don't know what part is what and put it over the camera lens instead of the flash.\n\nUnfortunately most of the time the answer to \"why don't we do this simple thing to fix this\" is simply that people are shitty.",

We installed safety nets and barriers to catch dropped items in the gator pond and people would try to throw coins around them or bitch that they ruined a photo op. People would constantly pound on the glass at our enclosures, especially the alligator snapping turtle (or they'd tell me he was dead because he wasn't moving, despite signage explaining this behavior). My favorite example was when I got called out to an altercation at our tortoise yard because a visitor had asked some children to stop throwing rocks at the tortoises and the parent started yelling at them for telling their kids what to do. The parent then started yelling at me when I asked her to please keep her kids from throwing rocks because the sign in the tortoise yard simply says \"please don't throw coins in the tortoise pond\" and says nothing about throwing rocks at the tortoises.",

Thing is, hunters often only receive a single buck tag and several doe tags- meaning they can only hunt a single buck- instead of the other way around. When fishing, if what you catch is out of season/too small, you must release it. In some places, you must release female crabs/lobsters. \n\nThis in turn aids in preserving the species and ecosystem while helping keep populations in check. \n\nPreserving wild spaces is no doubt at least partially motivated by wanting to make sure there are enough to hunt- Teddy Roosevelt, who was a pioneer of conservation of nature was also an avid hunter. Hunters and fishers depend on the conservation of wild areas to hunt. Hell, even in FL there is gator season- a time of year to hunt the American Alligator and keep its population in check after finally getting it to stable levels. Should it drop back into endangered or threatened status, there is no doubt that most will abide by the restrictions placed on hunting them. Many already take part in hunting invasive snakes in the Everglades threatening the native species and therefore threatening hunting them. \n\nAll in all, many hunters/fishers I've met love the outdoors and want to preserve these spaces.\n\nSorry if this is me going on a tangent.",

(I honestly feel completely horrible just writing those words down.  I'm tempted to delete, but I think it explains what I mean very clearly, so I guess I'll keep it.)  The argument could be made (sorry, I still feel yucky, but I'll stop apologizing and just carry on with the thought experiment, anyway) that this is benefiting the \"orphan population\" as a whole.  Still, there is something deeply morally repugnant that would make any one of us refuse to even contemplate the idea.  \"But,\" someone could say, \"what's our other option?  Let the orphanages go bankrupt?  Let the orphans starve?\"  To which my answer is:  I don't know!  I have no idea!  But not *that!*\n\nTo me, saying \"people's desire to kill animals is good, because it motivates them to protect the animals' habitats\" feels a little bit like saying \"people's desire to abuse orphans is good, because it motivates them to fund orphanages.\"\n\nAgain, I'm not commenting on any actual person's choice to hunt or fish.  I just think that there is something really, really tricky about trying to defend what is done to one individual (child or animal) by appealing to the impact that a perpetrator's motivatedness will indirectly have on the well-being of other individuals.",

The percentage of hooked pelicans in person versus pelicans who end up hooked or ensnared from from fishing line is definitely skewed",

They've been able to successfully breed vulnerable species like the white and black rhino, Giraffes, sumatran tigers, akapi,  and African elephants. All while educating their guests about said animals.\n\nI agree that some aquariums and zoos are terrible and need to be shut down but there are many more good than bad.",

Some aquariums are terrible but others are great for the fish. If the tank is too small or overcrowded or dirty with a ton of ammonia, that should not be allowed. If the tank has good stocking, live plants/coral(depending on fresh or salt), a good filter, a good heater(if needed), the fish will be very healthy and live longer than in the wild, since they won't have to worry about predators or pollution. Cories, plecos, goldfish, mollies, guppies, bettas, kuhli loaches, shrimp, snails, discus, angelfish, and certain pufferfish do incredibly well in aquariums. (I can't really speak for saltwater tanks, as that is not my area of expertise, but I know there are many freshwater fish perfect for aquariums.) If you want more information about aquariums, visit r/aquariums, r/aquascape, r/goldfish, or pretty much any other aquarium sub.",

There's a big difference between accidentally leaving your flash on, which is especially easy to do if you don't use your camera all that often, and just not giving a shit and taking a photo with flash anyways.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere may be signs around saying no flash photography but your sentiment seems to cover photography in general.  And telling people they shouldn't take pictures and just enjoy life, is meaningless and pointless.   You're on reddit, and most of these posts are from people doing just that, enjoying life while taking pictures.  \n\nSo what if you can find better pictures online?  Are we supposed to just leave it at that?  Yeah it sucks that this caused a fish to die, but making a weird blanket statement because of a single incident seems odd, but not out of place on reddit.",

Although it depends on the staff member I guess, as I've seen shy ones be less aggressive, but in general they're more attentive than any other aquarium I've been to. Still, every single time I'm in that room, several idiots are using flash photography, so this goes on day after day, all day. \n\n\nIf you see this shit as a guest, do know that you can tell the person to stop yourself. I've done that to people using flash photography on mummies and it really jars them for a fellow guest to confront them in any way, far more than if an employee politely tells them to stop. So take advantage of the fact that it's socially outside the norm and speak up. \n\nBut of course, to tell someone to cut it out, they have to have made the attempt first. And then the tuna is already dead. \n\nI hope this person feels immense guilt. And/or faces fines/charges, whatever can be thrown at them. Saying this is shitty behavior doesn't even begin to describe it. Humans are such stupid, self centered assholes.",

And at the touchpool, a guy listened to the very clear instructions to only use two fingers and let the rays and bamboo sharks come to you if they want to be touched, said he understood, then reached in and tried to pin a bamboo shark against the side of the pool with his hand. (He was told to leave almost immediately) At the zoo there's a central grassy area, with a pond, that often has a lot of wild ducks and geese fly in. And for a quarter, you can buy a good handful of waterfowl food, so of course they come up pretty close to people. And I've seen a family there where the parents were teaching their kids how to kick the geese and ducks! Encouraging them to see how hard they could kick the birds. They got escorted out of the zoo by security really fast.\n\nEdited to add, these are not common incidents, those three took place over the last half dozen years or so.",

Equally, we would tell people they couldn\u2019t have their dogs in the car with them if they were driving themselves through (and had kennels with water to temporarily keep dogs if people had a pet with them) and would warn them that one of the male lions also liked to eat spare tires attached to the front of cars.. so to remove those before driving through. But people would find ways to ignore us anyway, then game wardens would have to go help them when the lions wouldn\u2019t leave them alone. \n\nThere was a lawsuit (before I worked there) brought against the park by some idiot who decided to roll down their window and give the lions steak. Shocking to no one with a brain, this resulted in the lions trying to enter the car and mauling one of the occupants (the occupant only suffered minor injuries). Even though they entirely ignored park rules, they still got a payout for their dumbassery.",

An average of anything is not the center of that thing, unless there are only two numbers you are averaging. \n\nFor example. Let's say there is a group of three people. The average IQ is 100.... Two of the people have an IQ of 75 and one person has an IQ of 150. That means 2/3 or 66% of the people in that group have below average IQ. That is a lot more than half. \n\nYou could take this logic out to any number of people. \n\nA good real world example is if you go and compare the median household income to the average household income in the US. The average is a bit higher in 2019 at about $52k compared to the median which was about $34k because there are people.who just make soooo much money it skus the average upwards. That means more than half of the US makes a below average income. \n\nThat's why when they talk about incomes in a country they usually use the median. Because that is exactly half the people below and half the people above.",

Since 100 is the middle of the bell curve it will be on both sides of the middle the group. meaning 50% can't be 99 and below while also having 50% being 101 and above. So if 50% aren't 99 median and average are not the same. So 50% are dumber than the median person (who has an average IQ of 100), but 50% of people are not dumber than average (100iq) because that's the largest group. In reality, I think it's around 45-48% being below an IQ of 100.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification",

Your phone detects very subtle subtle movement and will keep the shutter open for a max of ten seconds if it is in your hand. But if it\u2019s on a tripod, it will stay open for 30 seconds. With this you can take pictures of the night sky and catch all those stars you can\u2019t see with your naked eye. There has to be absolutely zero other light source coming from any direction though to get a shot like that. I tried doing it once while camping.

Multiply that by thousands of visitors a day...\n\nYou already have to show your ticket at the entrance, why not just have a sticker that goes over your flash mechanism - you hold it up to show the ticket checker - and you walk in. Sure, some people might take it off, but that would probably take care of 90% of the problem with a 10-cent sticker.\n\nAt the louvre there was an insane amount of flash photography happening.

They are told by command not to fire their weapons there and they instruct the sargent to take all of his soldiers ammo. Well 2 marines are like \"fuck that, why would we go in defenseless?\" and secretly hide a few clips of ammo. The reason they shouldn't have any guns is because they are under the cooling plant to the nuclear reactor that powers the terraformer and they could be in deep shit if anything gets shot up down there. Well command negectled to relay any of that information and the reactor gets fucked in the crossfire.

Mature tuna are not reproducing quickly, and you're not restocking them quickly, so if old tuna + flash photography = splat, every time, or even every hundredth time, to keep mature tuna in a tank you need to cut the odds that they encounter flash down to almost nothing.  Or you just can't keep them in a tank.\n\nYou cannot assume with exotic problems like this, as you might with a lot of problems people encounter every day, that the thing you are doing to intervene is inside of the sufficient range of efficacy to accomplish a solution.",

It's not reasonable to expect most people to know that something like this could happen.  The comment thread here is proof enough of that.\n\nIt's like if I were in a fancy restaurant and I accidentally spilled my glass of water just as a server walked by carrying a tray full of hundreds of dollars worth food, slipped on the water, and spilled the food everywhere, I wouldn't be monetarily responsible for that food.  I made a mistake, and an accident happened because of it.  The risk of accidents happening like that is on the establishment, not on the customer.  Nobody forced the restaurant to have slippery floors instead of carpet, and nobody forced the aquarium to have fish that could charge bright lights in a tank like this.",

People who accidentally start a forest fire by failing to extinguish their campfire should be held fully responsible for the fire because everybody knows fire = dangerous and possibly deadly. Everybody knows car = dangerous and possibly deadly. I highly doubt most of the population is walking around thinking flash on my phone camera = dangerous and possibly deadly. I have no doubt in my mind that this person left their flash on by accident. Was it negligent? Perhaps. But did they likely have any idea doing it could kill one of the animals at the aquarium? No. Similarly, most adults over 50 who I know seem prone to leaving their flash on. Unfortunately it\u2019s a technology curve that the world has to age out of.",

Does a few acres of forest being burned down from negligence make you an asshole?\n\nWho decides at what point the severity of negligence makes you a bad person? \n\nInvoluntary Manslaughter is a crime?\nIs accidentally starting a forest fire?\nUsing flash in areas that state not to use it is probably not but it certainly goes against the establishments policies. \n\nSo why do you get to decide whether negligence makes you an asshole or not because of the consequence?\n\nGuilt for being an asshole doesn\u2019t remove your title of being an asshole either.\n\nCausing a negative outcome from something due to negligence should make you an asshole. \n\nNow I don\u2019t mean outcomes that really have no negatives or only affect yourself, for example you accidentally cut the wrong cable in your car because you didn\u2019t read the service manual. You can\u2019t be an asshole to yourself really. Negligence that only affects yourself is more of a lesson learned.

There are signs everywhere for this, that doesn't mean everybody immediately thinks to check their flash beforehand.  If you watch the clip, like actually watch it instead of injecting this weird context, you'd notice she took the picture with flash, immediately turned it off and then took another picture.   When I went to the aquarium in Atlanta, there definitely were signs posted, but nobody ever actually said anything until we were at the dolphin show.  They were adamant about it, and a few people got kicked out.  But they were purposefully doing it.  Intent is absolutely important here.  \n\nsince you are so hardcore on how aquariums work, you'll notice the thick glass/acrylic between the people and the fish, have you looked at those from any angle, you are not seeing the thing you are actually looking at.  She probably didn't even see the tuna, got embarrassed by the flash, and just turned it off.  That totally makes her an asshole right?  Negligence doesn't make you an asshole. Intent does. \n\nI'm not denying that this rule exists or that people should follow it.  But sometimes my flash is on and I have never used it once.  Sometimes it stays off, sometimes it doesn't.

After the fourth, the guide walked up and swore at them. 30 seconds passed, and they took a 5th photo and the orchestra stopped.\n\nThen they acted like they had no fucking idea what happened. As if not only had they not read any warnings, but as if they hadn't been directly addressed numerous times AND sworn at by the guide.\n\nI geniunely couldn't tell if they were intentionally obnoxious and ignorantly brain-dead.",

I don't blame the animal for its instinct, and I don't blame the aquarium for giving it a safe environment if the rules are followed.\n\n> Shouldn\u2019t they have the burden of providing adequate signage and warnings that would prevent such incidents\n\nThere are a few comments identifying the aquarium and the amount of signs it has for doing this \n\n> The actual death was more likely caused by its own confinement and motions\n\nIf it was a human who reacted like this, sure. But as an animal who can't control instincts, we have to take more responsibility on our own actions. She took the picture, which caused the fish to react instinctively, and it died. I genuinely don't see how that can be debated without disregarding almost all ideas of animal protection. \n\nI also am confused by the idea that the death was caused by it being in (apparently) the third largest aquarium in the world. There is, what, a single see through wall as clearly the most dangerous part of the exhibit? If you obey the rules, nothing gets harmed. She disobeyed the rules, and something died. And it's a very easy rule to follow.\n\nDo you think it's a fair example to equate this to someone putting out dog food or meat laced with blades or something dangerous? I don't think one can blame the dog, as it saw food and ate it. Much like this Tuna thought it was doing. Should the dog have thought ahead and checked that the food was safe?\n\nObviously in this hypothetical scenario, the INTENT of killing the animal is there. But here it was an accident. But you can and often should still be held responsible for the consequences of your own accident.\n\n\nOr what about if I am in a china shop and there is a sign saying \"no backpacks\" but I forget I'm wearing one (I've forgotten before, so I don't think this is unreasonable.). If I see and obey the rules - or even use critical thinking and consider that nearly every aquarium, zoo, pet shop says to not use flash - then everything is fine. But I accidentally left my backpack on, I take a turn and CRASH, I knock some china down. The china was left out there and had the possibility to fall, but I think it's still entirely my fault. \n\nThe obvious exception being if the china was placed so poorly and dangerously, then I would be frustrated that it was designed so badly. I would think the shop bears some responsibility, BUT I still have the easy majority of blame because without me and my actions, nothing would be broken.\nAnd I believe that the aquarium did not have its enclosure outfitted dangerously or recklessly. It's, by all accounts I've seen, a great place for the rescued/studied fish. The fish would be safer in the sea, sure. But the dog would be safer at home, and the china safer locked away.\n\nCan you explain why you think the woman should bear no guilt for her action here?",

But thats not how i saw it, experienced it, so why would i want to look at that?\n\nEdit: To be clear though, i dont really take photos for others.

      "text": "I literally just got recommended [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-tlKGjU2RE) a few days ago and one of the comment mentioned that the fish didn't die from the flashes, as the aquarium uses refractive glasses to prevent the lights from going in which really makes sense because why wouldn't they. The fish also didn't seem to be swimming towards the source of the flash. There are also other comments that said the fish was scared and tried to swim away from something that's why it had such high speed. Now there is one jp comment I found that said the fish did die because of the flash but all of the replies to the comment essentially said \"no it didn't\". Some dude even got ratio'ed in the replies when they said \"how can you say it wasn't the flash?\" to which someone replied to him \"the aquarium said so\".\n\nEdit: I scrolled the replies even more and they guy who ratio'ed the flash guy got ratio'ed even harder by someone who said \"To hide the fact that the aquarium didn't ban flashes, they stated that the cause of death was not a flash.\" So apparently we got some sort of Aquarium conspiracy theory going on??\n\nedit: They were having a sort of argument in the replies and some of them were also just meme-ing? I can't really tell. Can someone who speak japanese reveal the truth?\n\nedit: Further down in the replies and we got a fish expert. \"The Kuroshio saltwater tank at Churaumi Aquarium uses a special acrylic bark that is different from that used at other facilities, so general flash is not prohibited (although some powerful strobe equipment is prohibited). (We do prohibit some powerful strobe equipment.) We only allow flash in some areas, such as the deep-sea zone, and have prohibited it since the opening of the aquarium.\nIt is not unusual for a tuna to suddenly recoil and increase its speed, and cases of tuna colliding with and dying from loss of control are not uncommon. (Even in nature, the most common cause of tuna death is collision death. Some people have commented that tuna cannot recognize acrylic surfaces, but tuna have better eyesight than other fish, and their well-developed lateral line organs allow them to recognize acrylic surfaces to a certain degree. Also, even if tuna have positive phototaxis, it is difficult to imagine that they would rapidly accelerate to the surface of the acrylic surface in response to a single instant of light.\"\n\nlast edit: I did some digging and found [an interview article](https://nlab.itmedia.co.jp/nl/articles/1705/01/news103.htm) of the accident. It's deleted now but according to a comment one of the aquarium workers said \"It's not because of the flash. It's regrettable that the wrong view (died because of the flash) spreads.\" And amongst the jp community, there are some who believed that the fish died because of other causes (getting chased, got scared of something, etc) but there are also some who believes that the aquarium is lying to cover their own ass and the fish did in fact die because of the flash. At this point I don't even care anymore someone else can continue the investigation for me. Oh yeah and the channel also has a follow up part 2 vid in the desc so you might want to check that out.",

Besides, the tuna didn\u2019t crash anywhere near where the flash went off, so I\u2019m challenged to believe it was heading towards it. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not the cause, but I\u2019d prefer some other explanations to choose from.

As for why it didn\u2019t go directly towards the flash, my best guess is because there are a lot of other fish between where the flash went off and where the tuna originally was. Alternatively the tuna didn\u2019t take a direct path because it may have thought the fish was headed in that direction and moved to intercept it? I\u2019m no marine biologist though",

I feel like if it were true that flash photography = fish suiciding into the glass, the internet would have fuck tons of videos of it, both by aquarium-goers who ignorantly/accidentally used their flash (like the vid posted) and by people doing it on purpose to get a crazy video. Also, aquariums would enforce the no-flash rules very strictly if it caused thier animals to die. \n\nI grew up going to Monterey Bay Aquarium at least 4 times a year, and I saw a ton of people using their flash cameras. Never seen anything remotely close to what happened in this video. Not saying the OP is wrong, but it's fully reasonable to be skeptical.",

A good indicator of that is that they live longer lives and breed in captivity. That's the main goal of conservation and you should absolutely support the places that strive and achieve that.",

I'm not a fish expert, but I do know a few things about light...most of that flash did not make it into the tank, it was reflected back at the camera. Secondly, these fish know that they get fed from the top of the tank...they're not looking for food in the same way as they would in the wild. There's also this scientific paper, that details findings that point to no discernable effect caused by flash photography on fish: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37356-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-37356-2). \n\nI am totally open to the idea that I am wrong, but until I see more substantial evidence, I don't think this single flash caused that fish to kill itself.",

If you look when it\u2019s announced, the majority of the time there\u2019s glass between you and the subject. Therefore the glass will bounce back your light and you have a nice dark picture or a nice picture of your flash. \n\nMy favorite was a guy using a flash to take pictures of Disneylands Main Street light parade. I was a teen, kept chuckling every time he took a shot. Eventually, I leaned over and asked \u201cwhy are you using a flash to take pictures of light?\u201d He thought about it, replied \u201cyou\u2019re right\u201d turned the flash off.",

She said she did not know how many have died since the exhibit, which also features hammerhead sharks and sea turtles, opened in 1996.       \n\n>Aquarium experts and researchers have worked for years to devise ways to prevent open-ocean fish like the bluefin from running into walls. In Monterey, the thick acrylic wall between fish and visitors is veiled with a \u201cbubble curtain\u201d at nighttime, a sensory and visual signal to prevent fish from hitting the window, she said.",

If that is correct then they list the size as \"5,400 tons of water\". Not sure why it's listed by weight, but ok. Well then thats 10,800,000 lbs of water. Saltwater is 8.55lbs per gallon so thats 1,263,157 gallons. I highly doubt that is exact, but gives a really close estimation at least.

But refraction isn\u2019t as dramatic as I think you are assuming it is. certainly not enough for the light to have shifted enough so that a whale shark in your way wouldn\u2019t block it anymore, especially IF as this post assumes the light caused the tuna to think it was food, naturally it would go to the source of the light rather than a random spot in the direction of the light. These fish see camera flashes all the time, I think it\u2019s unlikely given the angle of the light vs where the fish targeted, and the fact they they\u2019re used to light flashes to have been an artificial factor. Personally I think it\u2019s more likely it was charging the other fish in the background for one reason or another just based on what I\u2019ve seen some fish do in the wild, and after the other fish moved, or because it had no intentions of actually following through with the charge, it changed course to get away from it and didn\u2019t Process that it was approaching a barrier, similar to how goldfish in a bowl behave. The spot in which the tuna crashed into the glass and the spot in which the light originated are a great distance apart, and would be a very steep angle for the light to refract at in my experience. Not one I\u2019ve seen done before.  the link you sent shows a pretty good example of how refraction works. That\u2019s about what an angle of refraction will look like. It will slightly adjust the angle at which light enters the water, not bend its point of visibility by 70 degrees or more.  Now let\u2019s see a source since you want to be a prick",
