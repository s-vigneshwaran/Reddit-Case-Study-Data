He also talks about how striving to be good enough is much healthier than striving to be perfect, obsessive perfectionism commonly being a consequence of traumatic upbringing. And my therapist hasn't read the book so the good enough concept seems to be just generally popular among therapists.\n\nAnd, that same book discusses how a lot of people from traumatic backgrounds end up in people professions. Apparently one form of dissociative behavior, what he calls \"fawning\", where you become hyper focused on other people or person while suppressing your own feelings, can be quite useful for this type of work. But it can also be problematic especially if you're not aware that this is a traumatic adaptation (as many of our parents or older generations don't), and where it is combined with other traumatic adaptations (e.g. \"fawn-fight\", where you drown your child in affection but become abusive when they don't express love in the way you want).\n\nTLDR good book, I recommend",

That's what they're for: a starting place for the long work of rebuilding a broken relationship.\n\nThere are also a lot of people that think an \"I'm sorry\" is a magic \"you can't be mad at me, i said i was sorry\" phrase.

I eventually realized this was emotional abuse (after he said he didn't want me to associate with his children) and vented about it on Facebook, trying to set privacy standards so they couldn't see it. Of course, someone screencapped it and sent it to them and I got one hell of a phone call the next day.\n\nBut that was basically it. I grieved losing them for a long time, but that's done now. I've said I don't know if I could feel sorry if I heard they'd died.\n\nA couple years after it went down, I saw he'd unblocked me on Facebook and considered re-friending. Then I decided to go ahead and block him so to keep that voice out of my life. Because if you forgive someone, **it doesn't mean you have you go back to where it was before it went down**. You're allowed to forgive but set boundaries, even if that boundary is \"keep the fuck away from me.\"\n\nAnd oddly enough, no other family really fell out with me, just them. Any friends who fell off, I'm doing okay without. Meanwhile, they lost me, and I'm a goddamn delight.",

My husband often retreats away from our two young daughters, hiding behind his desk or in the bedroom and become frustrated when interacted with too much. He's autistic and can't always handle the amount of noise the kids bring to the house. I try my best to pick up the slack, staying present and engaged, but also become overwhelmed when playing 20 questions with a kid after playing 20 questions with my junior technicians at work all day. I worry that one of those days where we both are emotionally drained and unable to give ourselves to the girls is going to be the memory that sticks, in light of all of our combined efforts to be good parents.\n\nIt's not excuse and forgiveness is earned, not required... but I think understanding that many folks are oft unequipped to actually raise kids correctly is tantamount to understanding how this kind of withdrawn behavior happens. Raising a child is a full time job, in a world that has been asking everyone to be engaged full time *plus* for the past several decades (and even double/triple full time for people on lower income spectrums). It really takes a village, and a lot of parents are more isolated than ever with few true support structures to lean on for relief other than school/daycare and just letting the kids loose on the house with minimal supervision.\n\nNo parent *wants* to be a bad parent. I'd be remiss to think that there's a single parent who doesn't worry about what they could or could have done better.",

If you're implying I'm a narcissist I'd wonder where even the fuck that comes from considering the entire point I'm jabbing at is that empathy for people who are struggling is important. If it's informational, disregard the previous - I do think spaces like this are super great and important for helping people sort out this kind of stuff.\n\n\"Don't breed\": This is clearly posted from a position of anger and I gotta say, this rhetoric is harmful to people are are trying their hardest and failing at best. I could (and did, thanks reddit) name off dozens of reasons someone might become a parent and then either become unable to parent properly after the fact, realize they were never ready to begin with after the fact, or be socially pressured into it (especially teenagers living in places that have poor sex education and contraceptive availability). Telling them \"just don't breed\" doesn't help anyone - most certainly not the kids who are suffering because of the troubles their parents are experiencing.\n\n\"as for the village shit\": You're clearly not a parent if you don't understand the context of this saying and what it means. We are social creatures. *Nobody,* and I mean ***nobody*** exists in a vacuum. Your mom didn't raise you alone. Nobody does. But there is an increasingly large number of people who exist in situations where they don't have social support structures. People who are essentially isolated - especially after having a kid. Nothing but them and a baby that will wake up every 2 hours every day on a fucking cycle screaming and shitting itself. They wind up having to lean *too heavily* on things like school systems and daycares just to make ends meet and not suck-start a shotgun.\n\nIt is *not* about shunting parental responsibility to other folks, and people who turn it into that are disingenuous. Shoving your kids off on someone else isn't \"the village raising the child\", it's called \"abandoning your responsibilities\".\n\nFrankly all of the above doesn't even come nearly close to fully encapsulating how I would have liked to respond and I still wound up spending way too long on this post. Your rhetoric is *incredibly* toxic and ignores the basic humanity and empathy - it ignores the fact that's we're all regular folks trying to get through out days and sometimes *shit happens* \\- and that shit can happen fast. Yea, toxic and narcissistic parents are very real and very problematic, but lumping them in together with regular-if-subpar parents as this monolithic concept you seem to be so pissy with is... well, it's just fucking immature.",

But more interesting when you think about it... Children grow a tiny bit every day and eventually they'll grow enough to exceed your strength capacity.... But at the same time, you're getting a little bit stronger every day. So I guess it boils down to can you gain enough strength each day to accommodate the next day's worth of growth?\n\nCan our muscles adapt a tiny bit every day and always be strong enough to lift the kid? Or do kids grow faster than our strength can increase (without spending extra time lifting)?",

I want them to think \"Oh shit, I need to call my mom\". I've put that into practice with my younger kids, I set boundaries and rules but I don't get mad at them when they mess up, I acknowledge that they've made a mistake and help them figure out how to do better next time. We have a wonderful close and loving relationship and I am looking forward to having the same relationship with them as adults.",

          "text": "> Blood relations don't make a family\n\nI agree!  \n\nWhilst I am close to my Mum, sister and nieces & nephew - I haven't spoken to my father in over 2 years...apparently he still thinks I care about him though? (After he told my sister he hated her, she was a slut and he'd rather see her and the kids homeless than move back home for a few months?! Nah mate.)\n\nAnywhoo...Mum was always willing to listen to anyone and offer help to whoever needed it - or even just a proper mum hug.  Both my sister and I have had friends tell us they wish she was their mum!  \n\nI'm kind of taking after her.  I have currently acquired 2 strays lol\n\nThe first is my daughters girlfriend.  She came to stay just after Christmas 2021 for a few days and her mum basically told her not to bother coming home.  Soo...she didn't.  She's happy here, she's not a bad kid (well, she's 18 in a few weeks time).  I'm pleased to say that she is now back on talking terms with her mum - there were underlying issues that she has managed to work through.\n\nThe other is a random girl my wife, daughter and her girlfriend found at a Comic Con.  The theme for my lot was Resident Evil.  They found a Lady D at the con and invited her to join the group.  My wife is known as the \"ComicCon Mum\" - there's about a dozen people who aeek her out at cons.  Anywhoo...\"Lady D\" didn't have the best life at home (narcissistic, abusive father and mum who just seems oblivious).  I converted the box room into a reasonably functional bedroom and kow she lives with us too (she's 20).\n\nThey aren't my lodgers - they're our extended acquired family and I love them all!  The one that really choked me up was when I was told I'd done more than their own father ever had! (Daughter is my step daughter, the girlfriend agreed that I was \"pretty alright\" - cheeky git).",

The original saying gets changed over years, and when the original starts 'coming back' it is thought to be a modern thing. \n\nSorry about the wall of text, I find stuff like this fascinating.",

However, the full quote is actually \u201cthe blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\u201d, which has the exact opposite meaning. The original meaning actually doesn\u2019t refer to family at all and instead comes from the idea that a bond made with someone that you\u2019ve shed blood with (in the past this would have been a literal reference to battle) is stronger than one had with someone you\u2019ve shared the womb with.\n\nhttps://www.helpforwriters.me/etymology-series-history-proverbs/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CBlood%20is%20Thicker%20Than%20Water%E2%80%9D&text=However%2C%20the%20full%20quote%20is,has%20the%20exact%20opposite%20meaning.",

I remember having a good conversation with her about how I was my own man now and I needed to be able to do my own thing without having curfews and whatnot. She agreed, I don't think she meant to try to be pushy or anything by it to begin with really.\n\nAnyways she was so cool about it I ended up just giving her a courtesy call almost every night after work anyway to let her know I'd be home late. You know just because she was cool about it all and I know she was just worried.\n\nI hope you can get the same thing going with your son! It's definitely possible, and it sounds like you guys are on the right track so keep at it! Remember things will get a bit different as puberty hits lol that's a strange time. But we all did it so we can relate",

I myself didn't have a rebellious stage during puberty, so it's hard for me to imagine what it's like, I only know how it's portrayed in pop culture (so I know nothing, hehe).  For now, I just want my kid to be able to tell me how he feels without being afraid of the consequences. And that includes how he feels about any aspect  of our relationship.\n\nWould you say that the respect and considertation your parents showed you influenced your own standards? As in you know how it is being treated with dignity and you wouldn't settle for disrespect, abuse and such?  Some people tell me that our approach will leave our kid unprepared for the world, not knowing how to deal with all sorts of unpleasant and just bad people, but I think it's the opposite. I'd love to know your take on this.",

I know how good life can be and in my opinion that makes it a lot easier to notice when people are treating you wrong. I don't understand how some of my friends put up with what look like miserable relationships with their spouses, if I found myself in that situation it'd be a hard no. Either time to fix it or time to leave, life isn't long enough to be miserable because of someone else. I'm perfectly capable of making myself miserable already if needed lol",

And for as long as the child in question is below 18/ is still studying, they will keep receiving said money. The more children you have, the more coins you\u2019ll get. So yeah, it\u2019s not uncommon for people of a lower class around here to get children and then neglect them and run away with the coins they were supposed to use for caring for them.

I'm about as far left as you can get and I still found my mind infected with the insidious thought of - ugh I don't know how to say it without feeling gross - *social duty.* So I subconsciously used that to justify greater risks and wound up with kid #1 on the way before I was emotionally mature enough or financially ready for a kid. Wound up dropping out of college on my 3rd year and joining the US Air Force in order to make ends meet. Now don't see that as me saying I regret my baby girls - I love em to bits and they drive everything I do - I just know I'd be able to provide for them better if #1 had waited about a year.\n\nI think it's something that stems from old culture that's deeply rooted in our social memory - and for good reason, it's kind of the biological imperative. But I really wish that on a broad social scale that we could move closer to framing raising kids as a life decision rather than a social imperative that everyone is expected to go through. Not everyone needs, wants, or should have kids - if someone wants to be happy with their cats and plants, fuckin let em. Socially pressuring folks and making em feel bad for not wanting to dive headlong into one of the, no shit, most difficult things anyone can even do in this day and age is gross.",

His father was very abusive but learning from my grandma the kind of home my grandpa came from, he was just acting the only way he knew how. I hear he did finally turn his life around before he died.\n\nI had a serious talk with my dad about a year ago telling him that he's kind of been a shit parent and that myself and my siblings were a little over it and he could either step up and be a father or, don't, we don't really care anymore. Thankfully he took it to heart and listened and he's been the father I wish he always was. He's finally learning how to express himself better, he's showing up when he needs to, he's learning to actually have fun again with us, all kinds of shit.\n\nI'm not saying everyone's parent who acts like this is going to get better but, if you lay down an ultimatum, be prepared to walk away.

Some of them actively didn't want kids, but for one reason or another were forced to give birth and raise a kid. \n\nI'm sure things won't get worse now that people are being forced to give birth, especially those who don't have the means to travel out of state for an abortion. I'm sure this will only result in good, and that child abuse won't increase, and that post birth murders (you know, when the baby is actually out of the womb and alive) won't become more common. fucking /s",

In my early 20s I wasn\u2019t making enough to live in the city on my own. I stayed with my mom to save. My dad would come to visit us (my under age sister, my brother and me) on Sundays to my mom\u2019s and called me a leech for not getting my own place. They owned their own place since they were young and dad couldn\u2019t understand how I couldn\u2019t afford to live on my own. He was against me renting, he wanted me to own a place. Like I had a good credit history for my age, but no bank is going to give you that type of credit and I didn\u2019t want that type of debt, knowing that it was more than half my salary at the time. Eventually I took all my savings a move to a different country. I occasionally text in the family group. Just generic stuff. The less they know about my life the better. My younger sister is also in another country now. My brother NEVER got called a leech even though he is the older one. And he is still at my mom\u2019s even though he owns an apartment now.",

We do have someone who effectively lobbies for your everyday man, called chamber of labor and various unions (which are mandatory by law after a corporation reaches a certain amount of employees etc).\n\n\nIn the US corporations did a great job lobbying your regular worker to be against unions. Which is just madness (but I feel like there is now coming a trend in the right direction, but time will tell)\n\nThe 2 party system doesn't help either, though. \ud83d\ude11",

I never once met someone who took a loan for living costs. If they couldn't live at home or living costs where included in the stipendium (those are rare, but exist), people work part time 2 or 3 days a week for about 20 hours. But that money certainly does NOT go towards the university and as I understand it, you would have to live while not studying too. Full disclosure, though, if you are nitpicky, Uni costs 300-400 Euro/Semester (depending on which branch). But as I said, you have to be a total dickhead to not get Stipendium if it's your first education path OR you simply don't  meet the requirements to enter the uni in the first place (regarding pre-education) OR its like your third branch your studying. And even then there are still multiple ways ro get some of the more exotic stipendium. \n\n3. Never once did I say I was studying at a uni. All I said is you can get advanced education while beeing paid 1000 euros. And that's a fact, my degree matches a Bachelor which is like a few years of university. Also: not sure if we understand the same under \"apprenticeship\" because again, I did not work a single hour during my fachkr\u00e4ftestipendium. And apprenticeship, as I translate it, would kind of imply working while learning. It was pretty much a Kolleg run by an HTL. Full time school. 100%. 1000 Euro/months. No strings attached.",

We have the KFW Kredit for that, and additional baf\u00f6g - that's all basically loan systems.\n\nNobody could ever pay for a room plus living costs with a part time job, which are limited to 450\u20ac in Germany. If the parents don't come up for it, it's the states in some way or private.\n\n> But as I said, you have to be a total dickhead to not get Stipendium if it's your first education path\n\nIn Austria, for non university studies. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> All I said is you can get advanced education while beeing paid 1000 euros.\n\nThat is not advanced education, it's basic education. Advanced education are masters and PhD degrees.\n\n >And that's a fact, my degree matches a Bachelor which is like a few years of university.\n\nNo it doesn't. I don't think it's a degree, it's a license or a diploma you got. Just because it took the same amount of educational years isn't equaling the academical relevance or value.\n\nA bachelor degree in finance is totally different level as an apprenticeship at a bank for 3 years. It's neither by education curriculum nor by financial compensation similar.\n\nSomeone who has an apprenticeship for something like mechatronics engineer is nowhere close to someone who studied the same topic.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>And apprenticeship, as I translate it, would kind of imply working while learning.\n\nNot necessarily, usually it is accompanied by a workplace to learn hands on. Not necessary though. Don't know about Austria, but it's simply not studying on neither a university nor college.",

Even though he's more of a \"dose of harsh reality\" type, he's never stopped encouraging or supporting me.\n\nIn some ways I subconsciously wish that my Dad wasn't a \"hero\" in my eyes, because I still don't have the mental fortitude to cope with the inevitable loss of him, even as I near age 30.\n\nI'm happy that you at least seem to have a great Mom who can try and make up the difference and that you treasure her. Make sure to hug her tight.",

There's no law degree at PSU, but there is a direct admission pathway to Williamette Law after 4 years at PSU.\n\nhttps://www.pdx.edu/student-finance/four-years-free\n\nhttps://willamette.edu/news/library/2021/02/new-law-program-portland-state.html#:~:text=Portland%20State%20University%20students%20can,based%20on%20certain%20academic%20credentials.",

All four of my parents' kids left home at 18, some returned, some came and went for awhile, but they were gone early. A few years after my dad died, my mom & I had a falling out. I'm talking screaming matches for days until finally she left the state we were living in and moved to be near my siblings. Afterwards I had the realization that I no longer had to have her approval for everything, I no longer had to worry about her judging me (which she was very good at doing). And after that parent role was dropped, I realized there was nothing left. That friendship she had avoided for so long was, unsurprisingly, not there. And so we talk on the phone maybe once a month about the weather. I have a better relationship with the owner of my favorite Chinese restaurant than I do with my mom.\n\nBut with my kids, my husband and I are definitely their friends. They come to us with problems, and we even hash out our problems with them occasionally, I think it's healthy to learn how to get through tough times together. I respect them, I love them, I am quite sure the feeling is mutual. They are polite, funny, kind, but also have boundaries. \n\nAnd yet, maybe I'm too easy on them. Just like your mom, I am a stickler about cleaning/organizing and I figure it's easier to do it myself than to tell them how. I suppose if that's the worst thing they are saddled with when they leave, it's not so bad.",

A number of us were joking around and I felt his comment crossed the line from joking/ribbing to mouthy/disrespectful. I couldn't give you an exact quote, and I'm willing to admit my response may have been due to some feelings of inadequacy or failure in the topic he was joking about. I got a little less joking in tone and said something along the lines of, \"Hey now, you're crossing a line. I'm still your dad.\" He got a bit of that \"Oh shit\" look on his face and toned it down while we all kept joking around.\n\nIf he was to say something similar today, the discussion would be different, more like when a friend shits on you rather than when your kid is disrespectful. And we've talked about some pretty hard things.",

It's not rare for parents like that to talk loud and proud of their children's achievements with other adults, but treat the kids like shit. \n\nIt has everything to do with this \"it happened to me and I turned out fine\" mentality as mentioned above. They tend to accept this thoughts because it's a pretty easy way to cope with dissonances like \"I want to be a good parent\" and \"I have no idea what I'm doing\".",

I feel for anyone who grew up with a parent with a mindset like this. It really sucks.",

          "text": "The books/talk shows/etc my mom used to consume were filled with this sort of just generally hateful authoritarian rhetoric. We were in Mormon Utah which absolutely did not help, but the stuff she was listening to was shockingly mainstream (not even just among Mormons- I mean, mainstream among Americans). it wasn\u2019t some obscure stuff. This wasn\u2019t too long ago either; I was born in \u201894 and my entire childhood she was listening to this stuff, I\u2019m sure she still does actually. \n\nBut one of their favorite phrases was, \u201cYOU ARE NOT YOUR CHILD\u2019S FRIEND.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m a woman and that made my mom treat me 10x worse. These sorts of ideologies are strict hierarchies with men at the top, then women, then children. Kids are treated with constant suspicion; parents are told to just assume their kid is a pos doing everything they do for the worst reasons possible. Like if a kid can\u2019t sleep or is doing poorly in school or is even just expressing an inconvenient emotion such as sadness, the consensus is that they\u2019re doing it because they\u2019re shitty entitled weasels and you should stop them with \u201ctough love\u201d rather than, like, actually finding out if your child is struggling. These are the people who always say to \u201cignore bullies\u201d and will punish the victim for getting themselves into that situation. If your parents weeent like that, I\u2019d bet you had a handful of teachers who were, at least. \n\nThis applies to women in general as well; the stereotypes are that they\u2019re manipulative and dramatic. It\u2019s mostly women consuming this stuff, and much of it is women writing this stuff- but the messaging is constantly straight up just \u201cSo, women are evil and stupid. If you are angry at your husband, remember that he\u2019s been working hard all day (it\u2019s irrelevant if the woman has a full time job on top of everything she does around the house, she\u2019s a woman and therefore doesn\u2019t do anything worthwhile) and is brilliant and logical. If you are unhappy, it\u2019s because you are innately a stupid, frivolous, hysterical woman who does everything for attention. Ignore your emotions and thoughts because they are wrong. Be obedient.\u201d I am barely exaggerating. \n\nSo when my older brother was a super abusive bully, I\u2019d be the one to be blamed because I was lower on the hierarchy, being female and younger, and that\u2019s how these people operate. \n\nThese fkn shows would also tell people to do awful shit like steal all of their kids\u2019 stuff as punishment, or, the best one: humiliation (also hitting your kids, but that was always the easiest to endure imo). You know all those posts you see where parents are making their kids hold signs in public about how awful they are? Yeah, that kind of stuff is actively encouraged by a lot of these conservative suburban groups. \n\nA lot of these groups- Mormons especially- pressure people to have children to an extreme degree, and as many as they possibly can. people who don\u2019t like or even actively resent children have like 10 of them and that breeds a culture where parents are doing the bare minimum to keep their children alive and out of the way, and lazy brutality is the easiest way to do so. It becomes completely normalized. I worked at an elementary school for a while, and practically all of the teachers were women with children. It was horrible the kinds of stuff they would say about their own kids and laugh off. Like they did not try to hide that they truly hated them. \n\nI left the church but still live in Utah and it\u2019s truly horrifying how mainstream this type of parenting and worldview are. People blame it on NPD or whatever but it\u2019s so much greater than that. It\u2019s an entire culture",

You learn to listen to those friends because as you mature you start to realize who always has your back, and isn't just there for you when it's time to party, but is there for you when it's time not to. \n\nThe opposite of that is to just enforce behavior through fear of punishment. No discussion about maybe why poor decisions are being made, no listening with empathy after a mistake has been made, just \"Don't do this, because I say so, or else, end of discussion\". This person is *not* your friend, they only serve to punish. So if there is some underlying issue that lead to a poor decision,  you're not going to bring it up with somebody with no interest in being your friend and being supportive, and only interested in *laying down the rules*, you'll just hide it.\n\nMaybe you overdrank because you're depressed, but you won't tell someone about the depression, if you're afraid of the reaction and punishment to Breaking A Rule. But if you bring it up with a friend, the friend will listen without judgement, talk about the reasons behind it, and maybe start to talk about how to avoid it in the future. \n\nYou're framing a \"friend\" as a negative person who encourages bad behavior. It's setting up Friends = Bad vs. People Who Tell You Want To Do, Or Else = Good. Instead you could be the example of what a *good* friend is versus a *bad* friend. They'll gravitate away from friends who ridicule mistakes or try to pressure them into activities through negative reinforcement (do this, or you can't be our friend), and gravitate towards friends who try to help fix problems, understand and talk good sense.",

They're gonna be an adult like the rest of us one day and you need to be able to see them as an equal - and that will never happen when you treat your kids like slaves from the outset. You can be a mentor and a guide without being a fucking slavedriver or restricting their privacies and freedoms. Gah!\n\nMy take on it with my girls is this: In my eyes, they're people - just like you and me. The difference between me and them is some brain chemistry and about 24 years of life experience. They're smart as hell and they learn *fast*. I'm here to mentor and guide and to provide a stable foundation from which they can leap when they're old enough. As long as I've done that - who gives a goddamn fuck if I play Smash Bros with them or some shit like that?\n\nI don't see how people can come off as so resentful to their own kids. Like, have some goddamn empathy, they didn't choose to be your child. \n\nSide-note: Why the heck would someone say \"fuck you\" for wanting to go to uni??? The hell?",

I'm more worried that I'm gonna find a completely different way to fuck my lil' ones up - but that's the concern of every parent I think. (or every parent that cares, at least)\n\nBest thing I can say is learn on the people who *do* support you and give back where you find positivity. Rarely do we get to choose who raises us, but we can always choose our crowd once we're out in the world. One of the biggest mistakes I've seen anyone make was continuing to try to rely on a toxic family just because there was a blood relation. (<- my Mom gave so much to her own blood-related family who only know how to take that she had nothing to give to me in turn)",

And just as tragic. For all concerned. \n\nSo, thanks but no thanks for your advice. I'll not bother trying to give any to you.

Etc etc...\n\nThen, well,  you'll be much more open to listening to others.

While always a parent first, there are so many other roles you must fulfill throughout the course of your children\u2019s years.  For trust and respect to be earned and lasting, it also has to be given. I\u2019ve found that the most important thing is consistency. Regardless of what role I needed to fulfill for my kids for a given situation or a particular stage of their lives, I tried my best to consistently do so from a loving perspective. Being a dictator will never produce lasting positive results.  Sometimes I needed to lovingly allow them to fail because in failure is when we learn how to solve problems and deal with adversity.",

Until you\u2019ve done it, you truly can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019s like. Anyone who actually has children knows they can and will exhibit troubling behavior - extreme selfishness, total narcissism, lack of empathy, aggression, etc. And it\u2019s the job of the parent to frame and mold their behavior away from these tendencies. And it\u2019s fucking hard. And compassion doesn\u2019t always work - sometimes you just have to be the enforcer.\n\nSo when I tell my kid that my wife and I aren\u2019t his friends, I further explain that it\u2019s because we have to make hard choices that he may not like. My job is to parent this kid, and try and make him a decent person who I can be friends with later in life.",

I wish to god I could adopt her because she's the sweetest girl ever and her dad is just a massive asshole for seemingly no reason. One example, we were playing DnD (I run a kids campaign) and it was going a little late. I had told her that it would end between 6-6:30 and it was 6:25. She was visibly nervous and asked if we were gonna be done soon (we werent). I asked why and she said she didn't want to walk home. Apparently her dad said if she wasn't outside on the street(he doesn't talk to the other parents, another red flag) that she van just walk home. She lives more than five miles away and this was only the second time she had been to my house, so she probably didn't know her way back. There's other worse stuff, but it just makes me sick you can treat your child like that.",

MySpace was around in the early 2000s, [as were many other social media sites/tools](https://www.businessinsider.com/aim-myspace-club-penguin-social-apps-popular-2010-decade-2019-11). LiveJournal came out before N'Sync's album did. \n\n2. \"Social Media\" in the late 90s and early 2000s included everything from MySpace to early-Facebook to AIM chat rooms to Friendster and all kinds of other places.\n\n3. CD players were around for a long time in the 2000s. I was a freshman in high school in 2006 and more people I knew had CD players than they did iPods or (something most people have completely forgotten about now because of phones) \"mp3 players\". Only the \"super rich kids\" had iPods. (At least, that was our perception as kids)\n\n4. All of this is moot because it doesn't matter when the N'Sync album came out, if it was banned in OP's household in 2001 when it came out it was still banned 5, 6, 7, 10 years later. So I don't see what \"social media\" as a term has anything to do with it.",

I remember in 1998 bying one of those cool carry cases for your car so you can keep your discman and cds together in one convenient carry case. \n\nThe social media were mostly messenger boards but we were forbidden from using them.

None of those children wanted to grow up to become abusers and victimizers.  They suffered just as we all suffer.  They made mistakes just as we all make mistakes.\n\nThere is a line to be drawn and you are correct.  But there is also a level of existence one can reach where you can experience multiple dimensions of a situations simultaneously.  It is empowering and if matched with the right skill set it can give you a powerful way to take control of more than just your own life but your parents.\n\nThere are deeper truths that are hidden from us that are beyond what I am desribing in the previous paragraph, truths that reveal all of us as being vicitmized in all sorts of ways we don't even realize.  For example, we believe that we are free to make political, consumer or health choices, but we are not.  We are under the thumb and influence of so many special interests one wonders if we are little more than cattle.\n\nWe can even victimize our selves without realizing it.  Places like reddit, by virtue of it's self selection bias has filtered out ALL critical thought and conversation in favour of a kind of homogeneity of acceptance and inclusion.  On the surface of it this seems like a great thing, but it isn't.  As this thread is an example, reddit really fosters a kind of congretation of self flagulation to the point where it has become fetishized like a prize at a fair.  \n\nOn the one hand, I appreciate the need to JUST SAY SOMETHING TO SOMEONE and have someone echo those needs back.  I get, I was there, I am there, we are all there.\n\nBut, there is literally no one balancing any of this out.  No one is giving any of you tools and ways of escaping some of these scenarios, especially those we create for our selves.\n\nIn an obtuse way, my point is just that people would be surprised at the power of hello.",

Probably. See Wikipedia for more, apparently it's complicated.\n>The urbane Irish nationalist Robert Wilson Lynd published an article, \"A Defence of Superstition\", in the 1 October 1921 edition of the New Statesman, a British liberal political and cultural magazine, regarding the theatre as the second-most superstitious institution in England, after horse racing. In horse racing, Lynd asserted that to wish a man luck is considered unlucky and so \"You should say something insulting such as, 'May you break your leg!'\"[10] Thus, the expression could reflect a now-forgotten superstition (perhaps a theatrical superstition, though Lynd's 1921 mention is non-theatrical) in which directly wishing a person \"good luck\" would be considered bad luck, therefore an alternative way of wishing luck was employed.[11][12][13]",

When he was 17 he told me he had a secret but he didn't want to tell me, in fact, he had promised not to. I said, \"Ok\" and let it go. At one point he and my roommate's son were whispering in the living room and my roommate was badgering him to know the secret. He looked at me and said, \"Fine, do you want to know the secret\"?! \"I said, \"Sure, but can you help me off the couch first? It's basically sunk into the ground and I have to use the restroom\"? In the restroom, I realized my roommate was being nosy, and I still didn't care because I trusted him\". When I came out, there he was looking all stressed, prepared to reveal his big secret. I grabbed him and whispered our oft-quoted family rule, privacy being a gift, apologized, and let it go. Years later I found out that he and another one of his classmates were in love and he bought her a ticket to attend prom but she had told her parents she was attending with a group of friends, which she did. But he was part of that group and she was really there as his date. Her family was very strict, from the middle east and would not like to know that she was friends with him much less in love. No harm, no foul. Actually good parenting and faith in him that was clearly earned.",

I've worked with children and have fostered great relationships as a mentor/authority figure as these children have grown, I can say that if my child doesn't understand respect and that everywhere in the world there is a hierarchy where when push comes to shove you have to listen to the person in charge or face consequences....then I've failed. If they want to blame me for teaching them that and not letting walk all over people in the house, and they want to stop talking to me, good riddance because they are failures that are too selfish to think about those around them. They'll never be abused in their life, but they'll never have complete free reign while under a roof I pay for and while taking advantages of services that I pay bills on. Even their phones will be confiscated if they fuck up bad enough and aren't helping pay for it. Hell, given public schools and how trash they are nowadays, I have the ability to home school if I wanted to go that route so I'll even use that if they want to fuck around and find out.\n\nP.S. This take is also based around personal experience with child development, so it's just as valid as anything anyone else is commenting to say that \"all your kids are going to hate you for not letting them do what they want wah wah wah...\"",

No job with no car, etc. \n\nWhen it came time to leave for college, I had never experienced a party, never been exposed to alcohol, I was basically dumped out into the world with way too much money from student loans and scholarships, and what happened was predictable. I spent my whole first semester chasing women, getting drunk, and playing video games, basically doing 18 years of stuff I wanted to do before college within 5 months. Almost failed out of college, has to switch majors, should have been arrested or even dead a few times, etc. \n\nI won\u2019t blame all of that on my mom, I was a shit head, but she didn\u2019t do me any favors either. Let your kids experience stuff while they still live at home, let them go to a party and see what a hangover feels like. If they fuck up, at least they have you to fall back on, if they are at college and fuck up they are basically on their own. \n\nI didn\u2019t talk to my mom for about 5 years after I left for college. But after that I think she realized she was too strict and she became a lot more friendly. Now I finally have a great relationship with her, but it\u2019s also been 13 years since I left home.",

But a parent OWES their child respect, they were the ones to decide to have the child. The child did not choose to be there.\n\nThey owe their child to listen to their opinions and greivences. They owe them the respect to understand when they are overwhelmed. Finished eating, tired, need a moment alone... And Privacy.\n\nA child should love and respect their parent if they are good parents. If their parents respect them. Any kind of respect should be returned.\n\nWhich no parent should have a problem with... If they are good parents, all respect they give us owed back to them. Giving your child the respect a parent should have for a child, in turn, will make the child owe you that same respect. It's really that simple.\n\nChildren of abusive parents do not owe their parents respect. Children of good parents do.\n\nWhen I have kids, I don't worry if the child will owe me love and respect. I don't need to. I know that I will give my child the love and respect I owe them for bringing them into such a hard world, and in return I hope they will be good people and share the same love and respect to me and to my grandchildren one day.\n\nThis is an abstract concept though, so it's different for everyone what respect means to them.

      "text": "Some people want to be loved too much, so never discipline their kids or make them learn valuable lessons by introducing them to limitations, rules and boundaries, and simple tasks like chores around the house. So there is some wisdom in the \"im not here to be your friend, im here to make sure you grow up properly\" way of thinking. It is important to show love and empathy too though because its also just as important.\n\nMy partners friend is such a loving person, but she has a lot of problems with her children because they have no boundaries and never have. The eldest rules the house now because she cant physically make him do anything he doesnt want to do. She cant have her own friends round for a brew in the house because \"he doesnt like them in the front room\", they have never had a bedtime. He will eat nothing other than grated cheese sandwiches with the crusts cut off, and has his whole life. He might love his mother, but Ive never seen any evidence of it - mostly contempt and zero respect. He will push her and hit her if she attempts to stop him doing anything, hes 16 now and a big lad.\n\nLikewise ive known parents who have lots of stricter rules and boundaries and their kids still show lots of love for their parents. You can love your kids and still discipline them, the two are not mutually exclusive. The hard part is that children, particularly teenagers will naturally test and push their boundaries, and its not easy. They might adapt to anything you do, the naughty step or grounding them from playing out etc might not always deter them, so punishments can escalate to stupid measures like a weeks grounding for something minor that sounds incredibly petty. What do you do then if they do it again after you sitting down and calmy explaining to them why they shouldnt do something? Ground them two weeks? Tell them they will lose something dear to them? Asking nicely doesnt always work.\n\nI can almost guarantee that most of the posts on Reddit where someone got called \"parent of the year\" for taking their kids door off or smashing up their games console, and theres loads of comments about how people dont speak to their parents any more because they did stuff like that..what they dont realise is that its hard, and theres often a long road of frustration before it gets to that. It doesnt mean its okay to do those things as a parent, but good god I understand getting to that point.\n\nIt doesnt help if nobody elses parents seem to do any parenting either - my teenagers friends all seemed to be allowed out till gone 11 at night, playing on the streets in the dark, staying up talking on the phone till two or three o clock in the morning on a school night. So we looked unreasonable and strict by telling him he had to be off his devices at 10pm and asleep by 11pm. I work shifts so two out of three weeks I couldnt enforce it, and half the time my partner would be asleep before him so he would stay up - so the only way I could stop him was by taking his phone to work and setting up an internet blocker. I tried grounding him first but he did it any way, so I grounded him longer, took his phone off him for weeks etc..still did it anyway. He probably still stayed up when I wasnt there(I suspected he was watching dvds instead), but theres only so much you can do without being there. It sounds extreme, but thats how it can be. As a parent I felt I had to do something as he wasnt getting up for school and it was affecting his work because he was too tired - I couldnt have that when he was sitting his exams.\n\nIts not easy, and theres no blanket fit all guidance other than \"dont be a dick\". You will feel like one often though.",

Setting boundaries does many wonderful things for the relationship, including establish clear roles and communicate needs. And yes, this also means the child sets boundaries as well. \n\nThis asshole in the tweet has an authoritarian parenting style. His children might fear and love him, but they\u2019ll never respect him. Everyone has a right to privacy, and that includes adolescents. They are growing and evolving at a rapid pace in so many ways. They need to be able to explore themselves and the world around them. They need the freedom to make choices and experiences the consequences of said choices. It is important to trust them to make some decisions.",

You don't get to hide from me or mom all the time because you're not feeling social or because you know we are expecting you to get your chores done. I also teach my kids they need to face things, when I knock on their door it's not because I'm checking on them usually. Most of the time it's because I need something from them or need them to do something and I'm sorry, privacy does not mean you get to hide from responsibilities.\n\nI also do believe that parents have authority over you in some way. When I tell you to clean your room, I'm not asking, you don't have a choice. You're going to clean your room. Now if you're in the middle of a game ok, finish your game, then clean your room, but you don't get to put a lock on your door and refuse to do anything mom and I ask you to do because \"privacy.\" You're the child and I'm the parents, there is a hierarchy here and you're at the bottom of it when it comes to whether or not you have a say in chores and other household responsibilities.\n\nSo I get the guys point. You can lock yourself in your room and ignore the stack of dishes and piles of dirty clothes once you move out and pay your own bills, until then there are certain things you don't have a say in and you don't have a choice of whether or not you have to do them, until you move out and support yourself.",

My children are doing good, I\u2019m there for them all the time and encourage them to develop, I love them dearly and they know it.\n\nMy mom is great on the other hand, they also aren\u2019t together anymore for a long time, and she met an awesome guy who I consider my father now, even as an adult. My kids call him grandpa, and he\u2019s always so happy and engaged.\n\nI can never respect anyone who can take the words like above in his mouth. I hope he gets to life through the consequences of that because these aren\u2019t wounds that you can heal later on.",

I didn't have great role models growing up, and neither did my wife. So we chugged along doing the best we could, but when push came to shove, we reached down into that toolbox we grew up with and pulled out a hammer more often than not.\n\nNow, here's the thing... One thing we did NOT have when our kids were growing up were involved grandparents. Our parents were not involved in the raising of our children. I will be damn sure to be involved in the raising of our grandchildren. With age comes maturity, and sometimes parents and children are too emotionally close to each other to take a breath and relax.

My grandma who I love dearly is my mother's mother and she not only doesn't believe me about the beatings, but keeps insisting we patch things up. Almost every time I speak to her she mentions how sad she is that we're not speaking to each other and she's 83 years old and that she might die soon and we still won't be speaking and it breaks my heart, but for a long time, even seeing her would give me nightmares and I know she hasn't changed. She has tried communicating with me or fixing things, if you listen to her she's the victim. Thank you for the opportunity to vent.",

There's a difference between friendly and friends.\n\nI love my kids, I do everything I can for them, give up my own things if they need something.  But at the end of the day this is not a democracy, it's a benevolent dictatorship.  If I say that the house needs cleaning and to pick up toys/dirty clothes or that we're going grocery shopping, or out on an errand etc. Then I give at least a short warning and a reason for going but we are going.  No, we're not discussing it, I'm sorry if you don't want to go, no it's not unfair, no you can't stay home with Grandma AGAIN. You're. Coming.\n\nThat isn't a relationship you have with your friends. \n\nA lot of people here seem to be thinking that you're either friends or you die alone in a hospice...\n\nAs a teacher I'm not friends with my students either, I give an instruction, a reason, and an expectation of completion/time and then THAT'S IT.  I might give options, a choice of assignments, personal stake in shaping the project etc. I'll take your input and may think it's great and include our alter my plan.  But in the end my decision is the one that stands, I'm not accepting \"nah I'm not doing it\".  I would however tell my friend \"nah I don't feel like it\".\n\nTl;Dr Parents of minors can be friendly but not friends.",

Like, I agonized over that.\n\nNowadays that child is now a complete adult and always gets mad if somebody else carpools on his rides to work with me, because he sees those as quality time with his mom. He is my go-to for anime recommendations since he can tell me what to steer clear from, since I desire NO fan service in my stories. He brags to his friends that his mom became a Minecraft wizard in order to spend quality time with him while he was a child, and can make sorters big enough to collapse whole chunks... so yah smug.\n\nThen I process the idea that I became a Minecraft wizard while also working 12-hour days so that my single mom ass could also afford a nice life and enough computer equipment to even know how to collapse chunks... And to take him to all the zoos, and to take him to all the movies, and I kind of literally killed myself to make sure he had the kind of childhood a loved child deserves... So yah angry (not because I had to do all those things, but because there's parents out there who treat their kids like optional chores).\n\nI mean, your kid is supposed to be the most important project in your entire life, you're technically making another human being. I have never been able to wrap my mind around the idea of kicking ones offspring out just at the moment where they start figuring out how to adult. Seems insane. Just as stupid as not treating them like human beings.",

They\u2019d barge in on me while I was taking a shower if they thought I was taking too long or if they needed something from my bathroom. They completely enmeshed me, used me as a tool to help settle disputes with eachother and to help them cope with their own issues, all while completely dismissing any of my troubles. So I never felt like I had anyone to go to, and never felt like any of my thoughts or feelings were valid. I was just a vessel for helping others accomplish whatever they were looking for.\n\nIt\u2019s left me continuing this cycle where I distrust those who show me genuine love, and instead pursue relationships with people who don\u2019t really care about me or respect my feelings. Humans long for familiarity and tend to repeat the past until there\u2019s some conscious intervention, and luckily this is something I\u2019m working on in therapy now.

Instead, an unwaivering attitude of \"I'm right, and my kid is wrong as long as I pay the bills\" is adopted, which is a pretty good indicator of the father's character.

At first, things were ok. However, my step mom came into the picture and she and my dad literally started to hate us. Like, no joke they would go around yelling in the house how stupid we were. They would wake up early and then turn all the lights on and slam the doors so that we woke up. It was an actual hell. \n\nWe also had a very strict schedule. We woke up at 7, breakfast at 9, turn on electronics at 11, lunch at 12, turn off electronics at 1, turn them back in at 3, start making supper at 5, supper at 6, turn off electronics at 8, and go to bed at 9. \n\nThe meals lasted an hour, so if you tried to eat past the hour (like at 10), you would be in trouble. \n\nI am the oldest, so they raised by bedtime form 9-10 when I turned 17, but I couldn't do anything in this time besides read.\n\nAll day. Every single day. Untill I turned 18\n\nI don't know if it was my dad realizing that he might not see me again or what, but it's like a switch was flipped. They both suddenly became a lot nicer to my  other siblings, the schedule was suddenly alot more flexible, it was mind blowing. \n\nI also was suddenly able to do whatever I want, according to my dad. The rules just didn't apply to me anymore. I think this has something to do witht plan when I turned 18. I had a house lined up that I was going to rent, and I was just going to move out in the middle of school year. \n\nMy point is, that there is a difference between treatinf your kid as a friend, and treating them like they are an object for you to control. You are right, where it is your job to set boundaries, but you are wrong where you can't be the kids friend. My dad is now closer than ever to my other siblings. They are all friends. I'm honestly in a weird position because I don't just want to not see my dad again, but at the same time, everytime I'm around him, I think about the hell I went through....",

I would never do something stupid as a schedule like you had. They have their curfew, but we are flexible with it. They have their rules and limit. We can be strict in some cases, but never pressured them unreasonably.\n\nLike we enforce a daily media usage limit, at least before COVID. We try to get it back now. 4h a day are more then enough for 14 year old. and that is even too much.\n\nWhen they meet friends, they mostly have to tell us (they do that anyway without any input from us) and stay as long as they allowed. If they wanna stay longer, they ask and usually we are ok with it. They ask if they can go to the city (like half an our away by public transport), at least for now with 14 years old.\n\nWe are no helicopter parents at all, they always had a lot of freedoms. Hell, they went to the playground etc. By themself when they were 4 or 5. I mean, they had to go to school alone too later on. \n\nAs a parent you have to set boundaries. I know kids with parents not caring and the kids show really no good behaviour. Or mom's discussing with a 2 year old with terms, even a 14 year old would have problems to comprehend. It can work, but so far, I only know of one couple that did it right in a way.\n\nI try to keep a balance between being a friend and parent. I want them to see me as someone setting the rules, be open to talk about anything, can be fooled around with and so on.\n\nThe older the get, the more this changes and changed. At one point they won't be my kids anymore. They will be adults. On the same eye level as myself. That will be the time I'll be more of a friend then a parent. Helping and giving advice, but not enforcing anything anymore. We can only prepare them as much as possible. :)",

She would go through my backpack and and search my room when I was showering so she could read my personal journals and it got to the point where I would take my school bag into the bathroom with me so she couldn't do that. She continued to do this until my dad took custody of my sister and I in high school but (surprise surprise) would also rifle through my things when I would visit for her weekends of parental visitation.\n\nMind you this wasn't like peeking through my school assignments or looking to see what books I got from the school library. It was a cycle of \"you're a quiet kid. Instead of being a parent and taking to you, I'm home to assume you're lying about something\" > goes through my things > I hide what's going on so I get quiet > \"you're quiet so you must be hiding something serious I better go through your stuff\" \n\nI thought that was behind me when I turned 18 and stopped visitation.\n\nWrong! She did this until I moved in with my wife and I've since cut almost all contact with her. Because I had zero privacy (as an ADULT IN MY LATE TWENTIES she went to my house, read my current journal, snooped through my closet and found my sex toys, and then stole them to see how long it would take me to realize they were gone because how dare I have a sex life as we an adult) I do not trust her at all. \n\nShe doesn't know I'm gay, she doesn't know I'm trans, she doesn't know I'm married, she doesn't know I even moved in with my spouse and we own a house together. Is that really what you what to end up being to your kids?\n\n(I am running on no sleep and typing this on a phone so I hope it makes sense. All I want to say is Please don't push away your kids like that. You literally won't know what you're missing once they realize your trust and love is conditional on being able to invade their privacy and they decide to cut you off)",

That doesn't mean that you have to watch their every move and it's possible that the request for privacy that this dad is responding to is totally valid.

I walked to elementary almost every morning and walked home almost every afternoon. I was a latchkey kid.\n\nThere's parents that suck. This guy MIGHT be one. Or he might just be a dad trying his best to navigate raising children, which is not and never will be a one-size-fits-all gig.

The most basic thing I can direct you to is maslov's hierarchy of needs. \n\n\nFirst come physiological & biological needs as well as safety. Those are basic needs.\n\n\nThen are psychological needs, such as love/belonging and esteem. This is where privacy is. Those are needed for *growth*.\n\n\nLast comes self-actualization, which is finding your purpose in life etc.\n\n\n\nSo basically, by not giving kids any privacy, you're disturbing their growth.\n\n\nI hope you actually read this and become a better parent, you won't regret it.

And the kids are really okay with this?\n\nLook, what is the truth\u2026\n\nFrom the moment the child is born till the day they move out, the parents pretty much pays for every stitch of clothes they have, that warm and comfy bed they sleep in, the house they can call a roof over their heads, the gas they spend carting the kids butt around till they can become independent enough to do it themselves, etc. Sorry that not all parents are perfect and provide all of this, but for the ones that do, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s cool to disparage them for any reason. The ones that failed, then the child must survive and then move in. Carry the hate, you carry the weight. It\u2019s time to just let it go. \n\nFind a way to let bygones be bygones, and either love your parents and be appreciative of their sacrifice, or the other option is to just cut them out and move on. Quit carrying all that hate around, it ain\u2019t worth it. Either way, you\u2019re an adult now, you must take responsibility for what you do now. Just relax, and breathe. Find some love and put it where it will do the most good. \n\nIf you can\u2019t, then that\u2019s your problem, not the parents. You dig? Just a humble opinion\u2026",

I\u2019m just trying to open the eyes of some who believe that their truth is the only truth. \n\nI am open to the fact that I am not perfect, and that I didn\u2019t make a million mistakes raising my 4 kids, or my 4 step girls and now raising my 4 grandkids because of the abuse that they endured from a pair of shitty parents, one being my step daughter. \n\nI don\u2019t know what anyone else\u2019s truth is, but parents who actually love and care for their kids make a HUGE amount of sacrifices in order for their kids to be successful. Even to the point of putting their own hopes and dreams on hold or sometimes to be completely forgotten and discarded. Going poor to get that prom dress, or using their last $5 for gas to get their kids to school for a couple of days. \n\nWho knows. The kids usually don\u2019t, because the parents that try, also try to hide those pains from their kids to spare them that pain. \n\nYes, I may not be humble, but I sure loved my kids and grandkids and am sad when they forget me. Which has happened. Parents have feelings and wants and desires as adults. That\u2019s all \u2026\n\nI am sorry if my dumping has caused anyone pain. That is not my intention in the least\u2026",

Don\u2019t miss understand me though, the give your child everything attitude that we see more these days just leads to spoiled, entitled, arsehole children and is just as bad as the other extreme.\n\nJust remember, we start our lives shitting and pissing all over ourselves, needing someone to take care of us in full, we end our lives the same way.

Each child will present you with totally different challenges. A small percentage of children do not need stern discipline or correction in their lives. Most will succumb to the power of pier pressure, no matter how wisely you have informed them. You must step in with whatever it takes to stop your child from following a pier pressure path that will ruin their lives. It is so much easier to be best buddies no matter what. We all hate confrontation.  It is very hard & heart wrenching to correct or discipline a child to verify their safety and  keep them from stepping over the clear boundaries. Each child is different. The absolute most critical years to make sure they understand the boundaries are from 1 to 6 years. If you were their best friend without any correction during those years, you and the child are in deep trouble.",

Two children can be raised in the same family and one can be an upstanding citizen and one can be a heinous criminal, one child can love their parents and one can hate them. The other problem is children need different supports. In the case of a defiant and trouble making kid, parents need to be more strict, but for a kid who is self driven for success, follows rules, and sees the benefit of working towards goals, the parents can be more relaxed. Some kids cannot have privacy. I have a friend whose parents had to remove her bedroom door routinely because she was trying to smoke, drink, and have sex at ages she was far too young. She credits her parents from keeping her from getting pregnant or addicted to anything because they did this. I have a medical condition and my parents begged me not to lock doors like the bathroom and my bedroom because they were afraid I could have a medical emergency and not be able to reach me in time. Parenting needs to be based on what will help the child grow into a strong adult. There are bad parents, I am not denying that, but the idea parents need to treat their children identical is wrong, children need individual parenting as they grow.",

It took a completely off the rails heroin addiction to give a completely break down and reset of the relationship to get us to a more healthy one. Unlike a lot of others on here I believe it came from a good place out of fear but it had the opposite effect. Who knows if maybe I would have come to them when I started using opiates if it was a more open dynamic. I do know it made it much easier to hide things because I had been hiding stuff for years before hand and it made me feel little guilt because of that. I still have trouble talking about my mental health with them because they can attempt to be controlling and prying about my life and have a huge response instead of a one on one talking type response. I think that\u2019s because of the style relationship we had started from when I was in 6th grade.",

My philosophy is to live the best, most fulfilling life possible and BE HAPPY. That is my goal of living and I'm sure many people would say something very similar. Ma y of these types of parents say that it is to prepare them for the \"real world\" (whatever that is), but again to what end. \n\nIf sacrificing happiness and affection for those around you is what it takes to be financially successful (which, spoilers, is really the end these parents are attempting to go for), then why be rich and successful. In the end, money doesn't mean shit when your relationships with others are strained or non existent.\n\nAll this reminds me of one of my favorite little parables.\n\n\"One day a fisherman was lying on a beautiful beach, with his fishing pole propped up in the sand and his solitary line cast out into the sparkling blue surf. He was enjoying the warmth of the afternoon sun and the prospect of catching a fish.\n\nAbout that time, a businessman came walking down the beach, trying to relieve some of the stress of his workday. He noticed the fisherman sitting on the beach and decided to find out why this fisherman was lounging instead of working harder to make a living for himself and his family. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to catch many fish that way,\u201d said the businessman to the fisherman.\n\n\u201cYou should be working rather than lying on the beach!\u201d\n\nThe fisherman looked up at the businessman, smiled and replied, \u201cAnd what will my reward be?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can get bigger nets and catch more fish!\u201d was the businessman\u2019s answer. \u201cAnd then what will my reward be?\u201d asked the fisherman, still smiling. The businessman replied, \u201cYou will make money and you\u2019ll be able to buy a boat, which will then result in larger catches of fish!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then what will my reward be?\u201d asked the fisherman again.\n\nThe businessman was beginning to get a little irritated with the fisherman\u2019s questions. \u201cYou can buy a bigger boat, and hire some people to work for you!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd then what will my reward be?\u201d repeated the fisherman.\n\nThe businessman was getting angry. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand? You can build up a fleet of fishing boats, sail all over the world, and let all your employees catch fish for you!\u201d\n\nOnce again the fisherman asked, \u201cAnd then what will my reward be?\u201d\n\nThe businessman was red with rage and shouted at the fisherman, \u201cDon\u2019t you understand that you can become so rich that you will never have to work for your living again! You can spend all the rest of your days sitting on this beach, looking at the sunset. You won\u2019t have a care in the world!\u201d\n\nThe fisherman, still smiling, looked up and said, \u201cAnd what do you think I\u2019m doing right now?\u201d\"\n\nLet your children enjoy life, enjoy you, enjoy healthy relationships.",

      "text": "I mean I honestly have two sides to this on how I feel :/\n\n\nDad abused me, mentally tortured me.. most of the damage he did to me was psychological/emotional/mental. I fucking hated it. Every day since I was around 5-6 he started with it. It was hell, and it didn\u2019t stop until I left the house a few years back. He tried saying he\u2019d call the cops on me if I left or that I\u2019d never see him again if I left. Last time I even said a word to him was right after HS graduation in 2018. I was still underage, but I ditched my parents. I didn\u2019t want anything to do with them. And let\u2019s not even get into privacy. Privacy to my dad meant nothing. He said, and I quote, \u201cPrivacy is a privilege you\u2019ll earn when you uphold the responsibilities of the house, and when you start behaving the way you should\u201d (for context, I\u2019m part of the LGBTQA+ community and he\u2019s Roman Catholic). So yah, privacy was nonexistent for me. Hell, to me it was normal to have a camera in my room all my life (or well when he started treating me the way he did).\n\n\nAnd now onto the other side of the coin..\n\n\nIt\u2019s like, I can also understand it (The img, not what my dad did to me). Like, privacy is a privilege. Not to the point where it was like my dad, or to the point where you have no privacy at all. Ofc! Kids and teens need privacy and their own space, but that\u2019s only really if they earned it :/ yes ofc human decency in terms of privacy is required like don\u2019t put a camera in your child\u2019s room. Or don\u2019t remove their door. Or some other shit that keeps them fully exposed. Nah. Don\u2019t do that. But be more.. just there for your kid. If they\u2019re behaving bad at school like bullying kids/teens or harassing, or doing something they shouldn\u2019t/illegal, then well yea. Some of your privacy won\u2019t be private anymore. Bc I\u2019d be concerned about my child/teen. I wouldn\u2019t just idly by let my child/teen have all the privacy in the world while they\u2019re doing shit that\u2019ll get them in trouble or if they\u2019re doing something incorrect. Like nah. Prove to me that you deserve that privacy then you can have it back. I don\u2019t mean I\u2019m taking all their privacy. Just the stuff in relation to the bad shit they\u2019re doing. Bc like I said, I\u2019d want what\u2019s best for them. I wouldn\u2019t wanna sit there and not do anything to correct them or to teach them better.\n\n\nSo yea, I def get the post from past experiences, but like also.. Just give them sufficient privacy, and if you see/hear they\u2019re doing something bad then teach them what\u2019s right instead of what\u2019s wrong, or doing nothing at all, even if it means relinquishing them of SOME privacy just to know what exactly they\u2019re doing wrong/illegal.",

Going through their phone when it is unwarranted. Barging in through doors and attempting to control every aspect of their lives will make them anxious, lead to them inventing ways to circumvent you and still do what they want, and cause conflict between the two of you. \n\nYou have to strike an intermediate position as a parent. Willing to step in when necessary, but still allowing them to fall down and learn to get back up. A parent\u2019s first intuition is try to prevent their child from making the same mistakes they did, but that really doesn\u2019t ever work. What does work is when they are allowed to grow and go through life learning. You can tell them how it worked out for you, but understand that they may do it anyways.

My parents sent me to this country to study. I actually didn\u2019t even know i was going to Florida till 1 month before i was supposed to leave. Though i am grateful for the financial help it has created a relationship whereby they believe that because of this they own my life. They try to dictate everything from my major to who my friends are, who i should marry in the future and even how i dress and wether i should have pets or not. They make me apologize even when they are in the wrong and when i was a kid i would be beaten till i had injuries if i ever did anything wrong. I feel dissociated sometimes. Like I don\u2019t really own my life because i haven\u2019t been responsible for who i am today. I am quite literally in a mental jail. I know how much i can offer the world if i was just given a chance to be myself. I am an excellent songwriter and also an honors student so i know I\u2019m good at somethings individually. My brother is 26 and they do this to him too. They forced him to work for them and now he\u2019s nearing his late 20s, still lives in our childhood home and is basically becoming their errand boy/ minion. I dread this life. I dread going back to our childhood home. To all of the psychological abuse. I\u2019ve began to really have feelings of hate for my father because he has created a system where we all depend on him or are fucked. I recently spoke up about this and now i am stranded in Florida with thousands of dollars in tuition debt and will soon be homeless and possibly deported for failure to enroll in my last year. When i have kids I\u2019m going to make sure i do my best to raise them to become individuals. I want to discover who my children become given the right love and respect. Rather than force them to become something i want. Lately I\u2019ve honestly been contemplating ending it all but I don\u2019t want to give them the satisfaction of being right when they call me weak and useless. I also feel the anxiety of detaching myself from them.. where will i go? How do i cope when I have no one.",

Instead of just being a selfish prick yourself and go live your best life for years without even calling your mom or dad, you could freaking take them out for dinner or visit them whenever you can. At least call every once in a while, have laugh, buy them presents if you're able to. Is that too much to ask for?
