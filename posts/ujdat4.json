And those careers tend to be lower paying. And obviously a higher paying job is going to mean less student debt. \n\nAnd then, of course, there are the idiots who do things like in the story above. \n\nIt's kind of funny. A lot of people have me shit for getting married and having a baby instead of spending years and years in school. Yet I'm now I'm more successful than most of them. Turns out professionalism and a hard work ethic is a lot more valuable that a degree in gender studies.",

As for going to college, if you can't afford it...you likely don't need it. I mean, why go learn to do something if you think (delusionally) that you won't be considered for the job? You know why? So you can start your own business. History is filled with men who wouldn't be considered for jobs, and started rival firms that beat the OGs. So if, feministically speaking, we are equals...then the same measure applies to every la femme in existence. So deal with it.  \n\n\nPS: I guess American women owe their society...and the men who built them a lot. If we go by the debts they owe, it's literally colleges built by men, run by systems built by men. Essentially, none of them are actually self made...their success lays on the backs of their father, brothers, husbands sons...etc. Which makes their significant majority's fanatic hatred of men, just friggin weird. But let's hear more American opinions, cause it's the shoe wearer that knows where it pinches most.",
