We had a dispatcher who did the same thing to a couple people who called to report smelling smoke in their apartment, she hung up on the first one, downplayed the second one and then half assed putting in the call on the third one. The whole apartment complex ended up burning to the ground. She was fired, sued and icr now if she also went to jail for a few days. Fortunately nobody died. I always kept telling our supervisor she was going to get someone killed one day but nobody higher up would do anything about it. Very frustrating. I think/hope an outside person filing a legit complaint would have more power which would hopefully follow an investigation and tapes pulled into the 911 operator who is being negligent and the 911 operator who hung up on Twinkkitten would be fired.",

Sucks that this is the result but I guarentee you this wouodn\u2019t happen if they kade $30 an hour, something i\u2019d say is pretty reasonable considering people wantthem to be responsibility for life and death as you say\n\nThey could fire them but it would jusr get worse for you.

But speaking as a former dispatcher, so many of our calls are completely time-wasting and ridiculous. You probably don\u2019t realize how many people call law enforcement about squirrels fighting each other or to ask how to pay a parking ticket or to just ramble. Most of us are abrupt and \u201crude\u201d because we learn to be short in order to get the information we actually need and quickly ascertain whether the call is a priority- if it\u2019s not, then we are quickly able to redirect our time and energy to actual emergencies. We are also speaking to our officers on the radio at the exact same time we are on the phone with you- you may not realize because our line mutes when we key up on the radio, but we very well could be working through emergency situations on the radio with our officers, all while processing what you are telling us on the phone. It is possible the dispatcher could not hear her or understand her due to the whispering and made the terrible mistake of assuming it was not a priority call. I\u2019m not justifying the dispatcher hanging up on the caller, as that 100% should not have happened since the caller was in a real emergency situation, however, there is a lot you don\u2019t realize to the job and unfortunately a mistake was made. I do not at all believe it was malicious or due to the dispatcher being an \u201centitled piece of trash\u201d",

And then decides its not an important call and tells you that someone will be there when they aren't busy. And then you have to call back later to tell them the house exploded.

It's like going into surgery. You accept the fact that even if the doctor proceeds professionally and takes every precaution, you might still be done in by the anesthesia.\n\nHowever, if the doctor shows up blackout drunk screaming \"let's fucking do this bitches!\" And fucks up your surgery, your family ain't exactly going to be like \"he couldn't have done it much differently\".",

This wasn't a man who attempted to do everything correctly and unfortunate circumstance meant it just wasn't enough. It seems to me (and apparently to the court that ruled the grandparent's favor) that the social worker was confused, frightened, and frazzled, and the dispatcher seems to be annoyed by her lacking pivotal information and his own misunderstanding of her role (which she was fairly clear with from the get go). He doesn't make many efforts to calm her, he even seems to scold her at one point, and he ignores when she provides key details that this is a dangerous situation (She smells gasoline, it's a high profile case, a child inside is crying.) I absolutely understand where you're coming from and that we can't go pointing fingers because a tragedy happens and not every mistake is worth termination, but I certainly believe what this man did is worth termination.",

And it wasn't all downloaded CP that he had. Some of it was pictures and videos of children as young as 8 taken in his house. And pictures of Susan with her head placed on other bodies as well as pictures of him masturbating to a video he had taken of Susan. Dude was a class A creep. Wasn't a previous owner of the computer but it was a computer that had been in the house from before Josh and the kids moved in. So Josh, as far as we know, didn't have anything to do with the CP, but the kids were present when the FBI stepped in and found the CP so they were removed. But Josh was still under investigation for murdering his wife at the time.\n\nI think the appropriate leniency would have been to move the visitations to a conference room at the family services office or a different 3rd party location. Not just a full shift from public park to Joshs house.",

The pornography had been cached when viewed by the previous owner of the computer, which had been purchased by Susan secondhand. However, Utah authorities misled the court and accused Joshua of having viewed the images.[48] The images, while not illegal due to their being in a hand-drawn or cartoonish 3-D format, were cause for \"great concern\" to Manley, particularly given Joshua's earlier denial of possessing any such material. Joshua was recommended to receive a more thorough psychosexual evaluation and polygraph test, but Manley suggested no change in the visitation schedule with the Powell boys.[7]   \n  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Susan_Powell#Developments_in_2010%E2%80%932012",

I imagine the investigation into any of that was closed when Josh killed himself and the kids.\n\nIn 2011, Police were conducting a search for information into the disappearance of Susan Powell when they found images of child pornography in Steve Powell\u2019s home. The children in the images were his former neighbors. They seized computers, hard drives, discs, a camcorder, videos, and notebooks during the search. One disc seized from Powell\u2019s bedroom contained numerous photos and videos carefully cataloged into folders.

                      "text": "It gets worse.   \n\n\nSunday December 6, 2009 the Powell family is seen at church.  Monday neither Josh or Susan shows up to work. Eventually someone goes by their house to check on them and finds the house empty, the family vehicle gone. There is a spot on the floor that is wet from being cleaned with a fan blowing on it, but no sign of the family. Everyone is freaking out, reports them missing. They aren't answering their cell phones, etc. Monday evening, van pulls up to the house and Josh and the kids get out, but not Susan. Josh is taken for questioning and says he decided to take a spur of the moment camping trip(in Utah in December) with his 4 and 2 year old sons, and Susan was sleeping so he didn't wake her up. Completely forgot what day of the week it was so he didn't think about needing to call in to work. He has no idea where she could have gone. Except the kids say Mommy came with them but didn't come home with them. Obviously the police think Josh killed her. But they can't find her body. Turns out she had been planning to get divorced.   \n\n\nJosh got fired from his job and he and the kids moved in with his dad, Steven. Police think for sure Josh's brother was involved in Susan's death(or the cleanup) but are investigating everybody. So they end up searching Stevens house and found a bunch of creepo stuff, CP of his neighbors kids in the bath, videos of Susan, pictures of Susan's head on other peoples bodies, pictures of him masturbating to videos of Susan. Since the kids were present at the time CP was found in the house, the state was able to take custody of them. Judge ordered only supervised visitation in a public park. Josh/his family started a smear campaign against Susan's parents to try and make sure that only Josh got custody of them. Josh found a more sympathetic judge and cried to him about how everyone at the park recognized him from being on the news and it wasn't fair, wah wah, I need to have my kids alone in my house, judge agrees. The very first visit with his kids at his house is when he kills them and blows up the house.   \n\n\nHis dad was sentenced to 3 years in prison for CP, released after 2 years and then died of a heart attack. His brother jumped off a parking garage. Susans body was never found.",

Found a few old articles that mentioned that the dispatcher \"received a letter of reprimand\" as punishment. Pretty well known case among true crime buffs, but outside of that I don't think you are going to get anyone to care all that much.\n\nThe whole case was wild though. I'm surprised there aren't movies made about it.\n\nBasically Josh and Susan moved away from Josh's dad Steven because he was a creep, and thought Susan wanted to sleep with him, was overly sexual with her, etc. Josh himself was really controlling and Susan had thought about leaving him. So he killed her. While under investigation for murder, Josh and the kids moved in with his dad. The FBI shows up and finds that Susan was right about Steven being a huge creep. He had CP, videos of his neighbors in the bath, videos and pictures of Susan, pictures of himself masturbating to videos of Susan. Kids are removed from custody as a standard precaution since CP was found in the house they were all living in. Original judge orders that Josh can only have supervised visitation in a public park. Well this doesn't work for Josh so he asks a different judge to move the visitation to his new house because people look at him funny when they meet in public because of all the news stories about him. The judge agrees with Josh because gosh by golly he's just a normal loving dad who wants to have his kids alone for some reason, totally not suspicious at all. Very first visit at his new house and he murders them with a hatchet and blows up the house. Steven Powell gets sent to prison for the CP and then dies in 2018. Susan's body was never found.",

The first time my wife was with me (I didn't have an epipen at this time) and she called 999 (I'm in the UK). The operator stayed on the phone the entire time until the ambulance arrived.\n\nSecond time (I had an epipen and used it) I was in no state to talk to the operator before I took my epipen. Again my wife was there and did all of that for me. They again stayed on the phone with her and told her to put the phone on speaker phone so I could hear them. They also asked if I had a second epipen (I didn't but do carry two now) and to take it if I did.\n\nThe NHS ambulance and 999 service saved my life twice. Also, adding in that my wife is a god damn hero who acted so fast both times for me.\n\nAmongst the fear of an unknown allergy, I also have the fear that I won't be able to communicate that to the 999 operator. But I have every confidence that they won't hang up. I know that they have the ability to dispatch someone to my location even if I don't talk.\n\nI hope you are well and that this never happens to you again!!! If it does, I hope the emergency operator does their job first time and you're not having to call again!",

Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. Make a fist, grasp it with your other hand, and rest them in the center of your abdomen right below where your rib cage ends but above your belly button. This will be over the diaphragm.\n\n2. More or less throw yourself, fist-over-abdomen-first, at the edge of a kitchen counter or other hard surface at approximately waist height. (Backs of chairs also work.) When you hit the edge of the counter, it\u2019s going to make you basically punch yourself in the diaphragm, which will send a VERY strong puff of air up your windpipe that\u2019s pretty effective at dislodging stuck objects.\n\nLike they say, forewarned is forearmed!",

Lady called asking for a pizza, dispatch read between the lines \"does he have a gun?, yes I would like pepperoni\" etc.\n\nTried something similar once, and it failed miserably: one night I was on watch, guarding the entrance to the road of a mine, but my boss warned me the authorities had warned us the house right in front my spot had somebody broke in earlier, and they could still be in the area.\n\nAnd don't you know, the dude who broke into the house earlier shows up next to me like \"Yo, sup man? What you doing?\" (he was high or drunk) I acted casual (I legit didn't know if the guy was dangerous or not). So I stayed calm, and after a minute I pretended to call my brother (but called 911) and spoke to the operator as if she was my brother (cause the dude would stay close to me), telling her where I was, address and all. The operator never picked up on the situation and thought I was telling her I was with my brother, so I had to walk nervously away of the dude and quickly explain to the operator what was happening. Police showed up minutes later.\n\nI was lucky, the guy wasn't a huge threat in the end, but man...",

She didnt know who she was, she didnt recognize where we were (downtown in her hometown), and she was making up characters and talking about hurting people. I was 16 at the time and had no idea what to do, so I called the police (not to get her in trouble, but just so I could get her to a hospital because she wouldn't listen to me that something was wrong) I pretended to be on the phone with my mom asking for a ride, and the cop was just flat out ignoring this. \"I'm not your mom, this is the police station\" \"why are you calling if you just need a ride home?\" All this shit. Super frustrating. I also did the awkward walk away from her so I could whisper to the cops that my friend is having a breakdown and is talking about hurting people and then they came and she got the help she needed. Moral of the story is cops are dumb as shit.",

But my SO explained the situation calmly enough to be believed, and the elderly woman backed them up.\n\nYeah regardless the system needs to be fixed one policeman a couple of years back remarked that 97% of the force are focused on wealthier areas and that is what I have observed, my wealthier friends got WAY more police and way better treatment when calling police to their area. In contrast even my middle class friends have encountered unhelpful police for crimes as serious as rape.\n\nFor now, if you are in an ongoing longterm situation and the police aren't helping at all it may be an option to get private investigators, private security, a lawyer, or a camera. The police are way too stretched out in regular areas. If that's not affordable to you, that is why the community take the law into their own hands in some areas, ie get friends and family to watch over you.",

If anyone else witnessed what happened that is on your side that may be evidence you still can use.\n\nAgain, it may be too late, Idk the law in your area, some things have a legal timeout. I assume if it is too late to sue just keep doing what you are doing today which is tell other people so they know what to do when encountering the same, maybe read up on your rights where you live so you never have to experience such a thing again, at least not without the knowledge in your mind of what to do about it, which can feel powerful in a way.",

He calmly manipulated them and told a bunch of lies. I told them what happened, but after a bit of questioning about how exactly everything played out I said I couldn't remember certain details. Even though I was the only one beat up and clearly distraught they believed him and just left. It took two more years of physical and mental abuse to finally get a restraining order via a women's help center. He then violated the restraining order attacking me again. Called the police, the officer told me he couldn't do anything to help as this was still his residence as well. He attacked me again a few days later. I ran from the house and called out of pure desperation thinking they wouldn't help anyway, but this time I called the non emergency line and told then it was about a restraining order violation. This finally got me a sherif, and he told me that the other officers were wrong and should have gotten him out of the house.\n\nI have no trust in emergency services and would only call again if I was actively bleeding out",

Because young and pretty and white didn\u2019t do it for her here, because there were injuries on him, because she was kind of a mess when they came,\u201d\n\nThis perfect victim thing applies to rape victims as well. From [this](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/an-epidemic-of-disbelief/592807/):\n\n>\u201cThey only allow certain victims to go to trial, where they feel they have really rock-solid evidence,\u201d Campbell says. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to have the perfect victim, the perfect crime, the perfect witness\u2014and anybody who deviates from that is not going to have their day in court.\u201d Maybe the woman has a checkered past. Maybe she had too much to drink that night. Maybe she knew the suspect, triggering the nearly bulletproof defense of consent.\n\nPolice, in general, are too prejudiced to trust women. \n\n>In her 2015 report (a 550-page postmortem of Detroit\u2019s rape-kit scandal), detectives often said that women \u201cgot what they got\u201d if they knew the man. She asked one detective whether a man can rape an acquaintance. \u201cTruly rape?\u201d he asked. \u201cSometimes. But not most of the time.\u201d",

Thankfully he didn't have it in the end, but the paramedics were incredibly kind & gentle, knew exactly how to talk to a neurodiverse, tired, sick 4yo, & talked us through a couple of other more reliable tests than the rash/glass one. They spent ages with him. \n\nI've called the police & given up after 30 minutes on hold. But I've also called them because two men were breaking into my kids room with a crowbar & they were there in four minutes flat with dogs & three cars. Two officers sat with us for an hour afterwards until they were sure it was safe & we were OK. They were amazing. \n\nThe ambulance is the one that scares me most I think.

The call takers get several national and international certifications that have to be maintained and renewed. They have to spend a certain amount of hours training with a CTO and run a shift supervised before they are released to take calls on their own (and many have to train longer than the required amount of time, so it's not just an hour requirement). There is PD that is required to maintain their certification and to be promoted. The call center as a whole is certified with something that is quite rare. I wish I could remember the exact details.\n\nBasically, the director is very aware of the bad reputation that many call centers have and wants to ensure that 911 is the best it can be, because they are the first line of defense/help for every call, and because the profession is not taken seriously and they want to keep high quality people in that first line of defense, so the also advocate for call takers to be classified as First Responders.\n\nBut call takers like the one described in the news report. Those are the kind of people that make us disappointed.",

I think we all did it once when we were very young and didn't think anything of it. But I do know that phones can be tracked and if someone hangs up they would usually send a patrol car there soon after... 10 years ago. 6 years ago buddy got his ass beat up in my bar, I called the cops and before they got there i got the instigator out, without any hassle either. Sounds uneventful and it was. So when the cops show up 2 hours later they are asking for names. I handled it. they want names. Nope, took care of it. Well they still want names eh? Lol.

The dispatcher could not clearly hear him and when police arrived, they were unable to locate the car. While the police were on-scene, he called again and shared the exact color make and model of the car he was in but this information was never relayed to the officers. The search ended and he was found deceased by his father several hours later.

The dispatcher, who was overwhelmed with calls due to the flood, was impatient with the victim and berated her for getting into danger and not knowing her exact location. The victim drowned and the dispatcher did not face any consequences.

I don't want that on my conscience, so instead I got a job as a janitor and get paid minimum wage.\n\nHowever, I'm in a position where I can earn a poverty wage because I have nearly no expenses, no SO, no children, little rent...but imagine being a single mom, being out of options, and then you find this job where you're paid 70k a year, full medical and dental for you and your kids, good vacation days, AND they pay for your preschool. If I were in that situation I wouldn't be able to say no to the job, I'd take it, the stress would get to me and maybe someone would die because of it.\n\nIt's a bad position to be in for everyone...all because quite frankly it's one of the few jobs out there for people with no experience, training or (most importantly) connections that actually pays a decent wage.",

The method only works if it is secret enough that abusers don't know about it, but has to be recognized enough for non-abusers to notice. It's almost impossible to spread awareness to one group and not the other, so it's either a secret code that abuse victims are mostly unaware of, or it's a well-known code that abusers are aware of and is no longer safe to use.",

I am annoyed with myself that I never called police on him. He should have been taken in to custody right then. But they have you under control and it is hard to make decisions that hurt them in any way.

I think you\u2019re right - you do become conditioned to violence.

Initially, I didn\u2019t know he was a \u201cstraight drunk\u201d.  You couldn\u2019t tell he was drunk.  But that\u2019s when he lost all common sense.  He\u2019d hit me, I\u2019d close my eyes and I was 12 all over again and it was mother hitting me.  It felt so normal.  It was like a part of my life had been missing for so many years, and now it was back.  And that\u2019s why I tolerated it for the six months I did - which isn\u2019t long by most abuse stories.  He met another girl, got her pregnant, he married her, hit her while she was pregnant. She had another kid with him before she divorced him.  I never went out with another guy after that.  I didn\u2019t trust my judgement in picking men and I refused to put myself in that situation again.",

Since once we got married he ramped the abuse up. I mostly was subjected to narcissistic abuse. i.e coercive control, gaslighting, trauma bonding, threats of harm or or sometimes self harm, guilt trips, constantly being accused of doing everything wrong. I basically walked on egg shells. If it got physical, I always defended myself. I don\u2019t know, I just became like a damn robotic shell in the end. \n\nAnd it was the same with alcohol with him. He was one way one minute and after one single can he was a complete sociopath. He would spoil for a fight almost immediately. He couldn\u2019t handle me being okay, couldn\u2019t handle me improving myself or being generally happy. \n\nFair enough about relationships, I know that feeling. For some time it was that way for me too. But I trust my judgement now and there hasn\u2019t been anyone good enough to join our family again. I do often dream of having a partner in my life, someone who will value me the way he\u2019s supposed to? But I can\u2019t see that dream being a reality. I am not vulnerable anymore, not naive and I see right through most people upon meeting them. I just am now that person who never makes excuses for people to be poisonous. Everyone has their own responsibility to be a good person. We don\u2019t all share the same values, world views and beliefs and some of us lack a true moral fibre of any kind. I don\u2019t go around blaming anyone or judging harshly because I know that people all have their reasons. But I won\u2019t sit back and be a door mat and I won\u2019t be silent anymore. \n\nThe current state of the world is such that most men go through a traumatic childhood and honestly don\u2019t have the tools it takes to be a husband and be monogamous. I am raising two of them. I\u2019m doing my best and that\u2019s my way of giving to this world. We don\u2019t need men to be valuable as women. And vice versa. The best connections I have a with my two children and then within my community. If we all served one another in love and good deeds, we can all be fulfilled. :)",

To be beat up by a guy and say it felt normal because your mother did it, is not healthy. Your friend is used to be treated like this because that\u2019s all she knew growing up.  She accepts it because she\u2019s used to it from her mother, and this is her normal.  My heart breaks for her because it\u2019s no way to live. When my mother died, I hadn\u2019t spoken to her in over 30 years. To this day, I haven\u2019t shed a tear.  There was no funeral because of Covid - if there had been, I would have gone just to spit on her grave.  \n\nI did the same thing your friend is doing. The first time he started hitting me (and in my mind it was my mother), I almost let out a sigh of relief (welcome home) it was such a normal feeling that I hadn\u2019t had for so many years.  All that did was make me hate her more (if that was even possible). Your friend needs to break the cycle, but she has to do it herself. \n\nWhat really got me was when my mother said she couldn\u2019t understand how anyone could ever hit a dog.  So\u2026\u2026it\u2019s ok to beat the shit outta your kids, but not your dog.  This does not mean I condone hitting dogs, I\u2019m trying to grasp this convoluted rationalization my mother had.  \n\nTo the day she died, she didn\u2019t understand. She told my brother that her mother was abusive towards her, she sincerely didn\u2019t understand why I was so upset just because she hit me.  It was more than that.  The verbal abuse was degrading.  I know I\u2019m messed up. But my dogs keep me sane now.",

It\u2019s not about ordering a pizza in the middle of a kidnapping, I just never thought about using it as a means of getting help.  To think of \u201cpretending\u201d to order a pizza is a brilliant idea, my question is how do you think of ordering pizza as a means to get help as you\u2019re being driven off to never never-land?  Unless this a planned thought ahead of time for a \u201cjust in case\u201d.  I don\u2019t do the nightclub scene anymore, but I never went out in groups - I drove myself wherever and met my friends there.  I never got in a car with anybody else because I had my own, so I never thought down these lines, but now I\u2019m seeing hand signals that mean someone needs help - I did not know this!

I asked if they could send someone and she said \"you need to ask the local police\". I had no idea what that even meant so I asked if she had the number so I could call, and she said \"we are not a phone book service, people could be dying while im trying to get you off the phone\".\n\nSomeone possibly was dying! And she wouldnt listen. I did try a local police station number but it just said to call city office to set up an appointment. And city office is only open mon-thur 10am-2pm. \n\nWhat is even the point of all if those tax funded services?",

Funny how we have the staffing for that when the pay is decent (not great but on track to get better) and provide heavy incentives to attract experienced candidates; and none of us are upset at the work because we have enough staffing that even during peak times we have at least a few seconds to decompress between calls.\n\nI don't want to say pay is everything, but it's a whole lot.

Then the same thing happened when the apartment complex security guard showed up the same night. He just took the guy's word for it. \"Oh don't mind the noise, everything's fine.\" Like, are you kidding me?\n\nIt's a long, personal story but things happened that definitely could have been prevented had the 911 operator or security guard been more intuitive.",

They had called the suicide hotline after taking a bunch of pills to the point they were intoxicated, and the person on the other end of the line told them that they refused to talk to them, that they had to give the phone to someone else and that they were lying about killing themselves before hanging up. As fucked up and wrong as that was it was also serendipitous, as in frustration/hopelessness they jumped off a roof and someone saw it happen and called them an ambulance. If they hadn't my friend would have died from an overdose, instead they got away with a bunch of broken bones. I feel like stories such as these are all too common and there are too many people without a shred of compassion working these emergency call centers.",

Again, it\u2019s a waste of time to sit on a call with someone berating you instead of giving information that allows you to send help. \n\nSo you have to wonder how many of these situations involve just cursing, and how many involve callers being abusive because they are stressed out.\n\nCursing during a call is not the same as cursing AT the dispatcher.\n\nAnd, of course, there are plainly inept and/or biased dispatchers, like the one described in this newscast.",

That is just one story\u2026it took a decade and 3 doctors just to get endometriosis diagnosed, too.

(It didn't show up on the CT scan because it was tangled up behind my intestine probably by an endometriosis adhesion). They finally called the surgeon on call because I was screaming at them to do that, doubled in half because it was the position that hurt the least, and he chewed them out after taking one small poke at my side and wheeled me into the OR immediately. I'd never been so relieved in my life! I had been in torturous pain for three days because they kept sending me home, telling me it was probably just a ruptured ovarian cyst.

Hindsight is nice and all but when you\u2019re living the situation out it is so incredibly difficult to make the right decision.\n\nI\u2019ve had a gun pulled on me and we had a stalemate from about 11pm until the sun came out.. in September. We were on the second story and my shoes were by the front door so I had to contemplate jumping out he window and running to my car or I had to think about using the knife I keep in my bag. Dude was tall and his girlfriend was the mediator but he would get past her at times. I hid in the bathroom connected to their bedroom for most of the time. I was afraid he\u2019d start blasting through the thin door so I was crouched up on the counter with my knife out ready to pounce and do what was necessary. Every so often, when I tell this story, I hear someone say \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you just call the cops?\u201d As if I didn\u2019t think about that one in the moment with my phone on my person the entire time.\n\nMy point is- do not regret. It is not your fault. Survivor\u2019s guilt is a bitch but you were not the one who fucked up and caused someone to die. That is entirely on the person who\u2019s job it is to be the one to get emergency services there. You have zero obligation to make sure the dispatcher does their job even as an upstanding citizen and a wonderful person. You did what was necessary while she could not. It is entirely on her.",

                      "text": "I called 911 once because my mom was having an episode where she wasn't able to breath properly at all and was going into some kind of shock essentially. (It turned out to be a severe allergic reaction, unknown to her at the time, to a type of mold that is sometimes formed on wet cut grass. Had to inform our close neighbours not to mow their lawns on rainy, foggy or super humid days, closed the windows in case someone further down the street had mowed, etc) \n\nAnyway, I'm a 12 year old on the phone with 911 trying to describe what was happening, they start asking questions about my mom's health, her age, etc, normal stuff. They ask me if she has any allergies, I said shrimp and some medication that I can't remember or really pronounce, but I know it has a really long name. She asked me about the medication and I said all I know is it's something they use at hospitals because she has to wear a bracelet that says it. The dispatcher then berated me in the most rude way \"well you don't know very much about your mom then do you?\". Idk what came over me other than adrenaline because at the time I was such a shy kid, but I snapped back at her and said \"are you gunna argue with me or send an ambulance?\" \n\nLike she expected a child to remember the unpronounceable obscure medication that is only used in some forms of anesthesia while that said child is panicking and watching their mom borderline dying in front of their eyes. Despite me answering every other question on point, THAT was proof I \"didn't know my mother very well\".  Even if I didn't know her that well, what's the point, should I have not called and let her die or something? Did she want me to try to prove I knew her well enough or like confess that I didn't or something? \n\nAnd what would have happened if my mom had have died while I was waiting for the ambulance? Like, imagine a 12 year old not only having to cope with a dead parent but also the memory of an adult, who is literally supposed to help,  trying to guilt them about it. \n\nShe prioritized basically dunking on a kid instead of dispatching an ambulance in a life threatening situation.",

Buddy called 911.\n\nShe had a series od seizures without more than 10 seconds between them for 30 fucking minutes and 911 hadn't even answered the fucking phone yet. We got connected once and were disconnected after an automated voice told us to try calling again.\n\nThis woman was in full status epilepticus for 40 minutes, no answer from 911, no one driving by wanted to stop.\n\nWe only got free because people who knew the woman showed up, piled out of the car and started shouting threats at us thinking we attacked her. We picked her up, ran at them shouting \"drive to highland right fucking now. Do not stop for anything. Tell anyone you can there she has been having a seizure for over half an hour. Go right fucking now. Go go go go go!\"\n\nNo idea if they made it.",

Of course we do not absolutely know, but that isn\u2019t the point of moral and ethical philosophy.

So putting your head down, getting to work, and taking everything at face value means a very different thing if the flash flood meant that a lot of people were potentially at risk to drown, or whether the flash flood miraculously just targeted this single driver and was the only call the dispatcher received.\n\nIt\u2019s like the conundrum with self-driving cars. If a child runs out into the middle of the road and a self driving automobile can\u2019t stop in time should it hit the girl or swerve and potentially hit nobody/more people on the sidewalk. It\u2019s literally the same scenario. Whether we know the call volume the dispatcher had is not as important as we can assume the dispatcher needed to help other people. The question is how much time can you spend on a person in trouble at the expense of others?",

You start dehumanizing people and you eventually end up hanging up on that wailing mother because she hasn't said a goddamn word in 5 minutes because she's been too busy wailing.\n\nI'm not saying you haven't encountered horrific shit, and people cope how they cope, but as someone who has also encountered some really fucked up shit both working in a huge hospital and in recovery, I don't see how dehumanizing people could make me any more effective at my job.\n\nI just think its a shit take, and in my experience I don't even think you fully believe it. At least its hard for me to comprehend how you could.",

I think dehumanizing is a strong word for it\u2026but we have to maintain a strong emotional separation from the job and not dwell on anything for too long. If you start to let one call echo in your head and eat at you, you won\u2019t be on the top of your game for the next person, and it becomes a domino effect that is difficult to recover from. Unfortunately, once you\u2019re done one call, it is on to the next, and you have to mentally block out everything you just heard so you can stay focused. While on the phone, you always want to give the caller 100%, but it becomes equally jarring when you have callers with trivial/non-urgent complaints berate you and horribly verbally abuse you because in their mind, their \u2018emergency\u2019 is the biggest problem in the world, with no perspective of everything else going on in the world around them.  \n\nMy time in the call center led to alcohol addiction that I am currently in recovery from. I\u2019m attempting to get into therapy now for job related PTSD\u2026and our insurance is going to barely cover any of it. I found myself \u2018self medicating\u2019 because of how many nights I couldn\u2019t get the voices out of my head. Couldn\u2019t let go of the radio traffic. Couldn\u2019t shake the screams from some callers. We\u2019re not even considered first responders, and you\u2019d be amazed how many people, even in our own field, feel that dispatchers (and other first responders) that experience these emotions/addictions/psychological traumas are weak. In a way, by embracing the dehumanizing aspects, we are trying to safeguard our own humanity.   \n\nI\u2019ll still never be able to shake dispatching the call to my friend\u2019s suicide, or my own uncle\u2019s traumatic death.

But that isn't what they are saying, just that she should be held accountable for poor performance, and hostility to a dying person does qualify as poor performance. \n\nA nurse can give a patient all the right medicine but if they berate them, that terrible bedside manner is still a fireable offense. \n\n>no other caller could have done better since the victim was impossible to locate and wasn't listening to reason.\n\nThat's if saving the person was the only metric for performance. No other operator may have been able to locate them in time and get responders to them sure. But another operator could have comforted them rather than demeaning and berating them in their dying moments, and *that is doing better.*\n\nYou've dug your heels into a weird, unnecessary, pedantic denial of all accountability of someone who was an asshole to a dying person, as if that's not a bad thing in its own right.",

But there was an ask for money in those calls. That didn't happen here. It felt real.\n\nI figured it could still be a scam, but decided to call the non-emergency police number. I figured it couldn't hurt to report either way. I will never forget the person's response when I told her why I was calling. \"What do you want me to do about it?\" This was said in the snottiest tone possible. Really? \n\nI told her a kid could be in trouble. I have the number that called. She told me they can't do anything with that number, and there is literally nothing they can do. \n\nI said, well at the very least you can make a record of it in case a kid turns up missing, or if other calls get reported. Or if it's a scam, there is a record of that and the number. She said it doesn't work that way.\n\nAnd maybe it doesn't work that way. But her entire attitude was that I was a ridiculous person, wasting her time. She wasn't kind about it at all. She was snotty  and condescending. \n\nIf I'm not supposed to call and report a strange phone call from a child in distress, what is acceptable to report?",

But you can't get merit increases, because the pay steps are all laid out by years of service. So it just is what it is. \n\nFor most of my time, I worked by myself. That means that I was the sole person in charge of dispatching for over 100 square miles. A police department, 6 fire departments, and EMS. \n\nIf a bad accident happened, here's what I did: handled all 911 and regular phone calls that came in about it. Dispatched police and EMS for it. Dispatched advanced life support, because NJ has a 2-tiered EMS system. Dispatch fire for extrication. If the fire department of that area didn't have the jaws of life, I had to dispatch them plus the next closest department that did. \n\nBut wait, it's really bad, so they need a helicopter. Now I need to determine a landing zone. I figure out the closest viable landing spot, look up the map coordinates, and call for a helicopter and give them the coordinates. Tell them what radio frequency to switch to. Dispatch yet another fire department for a landing zone assignment, because they need to clear the area of debris and provide lighting assistance. Then I patch their radio frequency with the one I assigned to the helicopter, and monitor those. \n\nMeanwhile, the police are calling in license plates and drivers license numbers for me to record in the computer. If anything needs to be towed, I need to call the tow truck and record the tow log in the computer. Does someone need to be run for warrants? There are 3 systems I need to check by name, drivers license, and social security number. Does someone not have their license on them? I need to search DMV by their info to find the number. Is someone lying about their name/DOB/all of the above? It's my job to dig for info until I come up with their identity. \n\nIf someone was pronounced dead on the scene, I need to call the medical examiner and call out the accident reconstruction team. Was someone arrested for DUI? I'm opening the Sally port when they get back to the station, monitoring them on camera, and listening for the alarm in case the officer gets into trouble. Once they're run on the alcotest box (new form of breathalyzer), I'm the one that runs the numbers through the computer to make sure they're within an acceptable tolerance. All the whole, I've been time stamping every unit's response, arrival, and departure to the scene. \n\nOh, and by the way, other calls don't stop during this time. This is just one accident. Grandma still might have chest pain and need an ambulance. Greg might have a fender bender a few miles away. Kristy might come home and find her house was burglarized. \n\nDo I need to pee? Too bad, because I work by myself. Do I need to use my breast pump? Guess what? I did it while I worked. That's literally what I was told to do. So yes, I've give CPR instructions while using my breast pump. \n\nAll that, by myself, for $37,000. Oh, and a lifetime of PTSD from the 9 year old I got to listen to while her uncle bludgeoned her to death while she was on the phone with me. And the 2 year old I lost to a drowning. And the suicide victims I couldn't save. And the family members of mine that I couldn't save through the phone. It's a great job.",

In fact, the evidence shows that while Operator Reneau spoke rudely to Mrs. Stevens during the call, she actually bumped the call up in the order of importance shortly after receiving it,\" the department said in a report released Friday.",

But all in all, the caller didn\u2019t have much info to get the help to her sooner and the operator was trying to figure out where she was.\n\nNot defending this at all, it was really horrific and tragic to listen to, and really angering to hear the operator being so condescending when someone is in a life or death situation.

The comment I originally responded to was \"usually there is no reward for good actions or punishment for bad\".  I'm guessing, she's talking about being a good person or a not-so-good person.  \"What drives me?\"??  To be a good person?  I guess it's a combination of my upbringing, respect for others and my conscience.  I feel like all the kids that won \"participation trophies\" have all grown up and now they want rewards.  I know that I'm a valuable team member at work, my pay reflects that.  Getting rewarded for doing the job I agreed to do is called \"salary\".  Do I need to have my picture on the wall saying \"employee of the month\" like at a fast food place? No.  If you hired a contractor to put a new carpet in your house would you bake him a cake and write \"#1 Contractor\" on it as a reward for him doing his job?  LOL!  Anyway, have a great day.

She should have been nice but the report said that they were getting slammed with calls and she was asked to get on other calls. There were a total of 20 stranded car calls that night starting at 2:55 AM with and the victim as caller 15 @ 4:33 AM.  The 4 person team and limited graveyard shift police and fire prevented them from being able to help quickly. The department conducted a report that found that although she was rude...she had correctly called in all the help she could and was asked to respond to other calls coming in...the report just stated she could have been nicer in doing that and they would train the people still part of the team. I will link the report below.\n\nThe difference is that the story you linked the dispatcher did all she could before getting off and getting another call...in this case the dispatcher simply was rude and hung up.

It was a 22 minute phone call, which is a little different than the image being projected of a woman in pure panic being coldly denied help. That article actually says the dispatcher *did* violate policy, but she had resigned 2 weeks earlier and was literally on her last shift. The dispatcher was rude but that day they were overwhelmed and it was her final shift, and she spoke to the woman for 22 minutes, only rude in certain moments.\n\nWhy did she resign? No idea, but I worked as an EMT in the past and I know many dispatchers, many of them develop mental health issues from their work. \n\nSo two things here, the first is that the dispatcher obviously didn\u2019t want to be doing her job in the first place, for whatever reason but likely burnout. The second is that if the woman had already resigned and didn\u2019t actually break any laws, what the hell do you want them to do?? Write a stern letter? The attention of the media probably fucked up her life more than the justice system could anyway",

When you panic, sometimes it helps for someone to tell you to shut up, suck it up and do things one, two, and three you know?   \n\n\nMaybe she should've taken the other approach, maybe if she knew it was the woman's last moment she would've been nice. But she stayed on the line the whole time and never stopped trying to help her. I think that's not even close to this dispatcher hanging up on someone in an active shooter situation.

When the in-laws/grandparents called the cops to report that the dad was LITERALLY hacking the kids to death with a hatchet the operator told her to stop lying and hung up on her. Both kids were killed. Nothing happened to the dispatchers. Happened in Pierce County, WA and the dipshit PIO officer at the time is now the Sheriff.

I punched in at least 2 phone numbers...I only remember that both were about 7 digits long. One of them was my home phone. But for whatever shitty reason, one of my classmates decided to claim that I called 911.\n\nTL;DR version: Teacher believed the asshole-classmate and sent me to the principal's office, which was the first (and only) time I had gone there. It felt like I had been sentenced to prison, so I broke down into hysterics, bawling my eyes out in between trying to tell the principal that I really didn't call 911. And it must've worked because police never showed up (at school nor my house) and the school never called my parents about it.",

They're rarely face punishment of any kind, even for serious transgressions, and now they're not even expected to do their jobs in some cases. There is a class of people who are virtually untouchable, no matter what they do. The rest of us have little power to fight that.

Just because I'm not blindly antipolice doesn't mean I subscribe to cultist conservative ideologies. \n\nI'm just a normal left-leaning guy who tries to provide actual facts and reason when people jump to the usual tired one-liners and regurgitated statements about law enforcement. I'm reminded of a statement I read someplace along the lines of how quickly you realize that people in general on this site are just talking out of their ass once you see them talking so confidently yet incorrectly about something you know very well. Well, I'm a cop, so imagine the literal thousands of mental facepalms I do on the monthly reading people's ignorant and, frankly, clearly naive takes on law enforcement and just policing in general.\n\nWith that said, I never stated that you were wrong about certain workers being covered under qualified immunity with regard to civil lawsuits; I merely provided a clarification for the one or two open minded redditors who don't just accept anything that agrees with their worldview at face value.\n\nFor anyone reading this and wanting a more nuanced take on what qualified immunity is and isn't, [here's an excellent read](https://grahamfactor.substack.com/p/what-qualified-immunity-does-and?s=r) written by a former police officer.\n\nEdit: Added link.",

And when you've got the next one or two calls coming in and waiting to be answered that might be real emergencies, you have to judge whether it's worth delaying other potential real emergencies for the call you're on. Dispatchers have both standards they have to keep up to and also a lot of flexibility to make judgement calls and adapt to what's needed. Like, we're supposed to compete calls quickly and move on so we're available for the next one, but in a serious situation you can stay on the call as long as needed if you're able to.\n\nWe still have to consider though the new calls on hold waiting to be answered. Say you're on the line with someone who's hiding from a domestic abuser. Is the next call waitingon the queue just a McDonald's situation, or a mass shooting, a five-alarm fire, someone bleeding out, or another domestic abuse situation? You don't know until you move on and grab the new call.\n\nIt's not always that stressful or critical, but it can be. The dispatcher in this situation definitely fucked up though.\n\nEdit: How can a random citizen help make the process better? Help your local dispatchers out by not calling us to resolve your refund issues at a store or to be your personal racism service. Don't call us with bullshit. It's like going to the ER for a splinter or an upset stomach, while people who are dying are in line behind you waiting to be seen. Don't tie up emergency services on non-emergencies, and you might indirectly be helping save lives.",

While texting is more convenient for people in many cases, having a text conversation is MUCH slower and less detailed than a voice conversation; and in many cases the background of a 911 call is just as if not more important than the conversation itself. Tone and urgency are other things that you cannot pick up over a text conversation.\n\nBut back onto the slower part, many agencies struggle to answer 90% of 911 calls in 10 seconds or less. Now add in the fact that you have to pull more and more dispatchers to answer 911 texts? The same already low staffing is now even lower. Not to mention due to human nature, the ease of texting will cause there to be more 911 calls as it did back when mobile phones were just becoming a thing (just the convenience of not having to go to the room that had the landline in it was enough for the medical side alone to have to respond to more ridiculously menial calls).\n\nAs for ADA compliance for deaf/hard of hearing, TTY/TDD has been integrated in 911 for quite a while without the need for texting.\n\nAs unfortunate as it sounds, forcing people to call over text is a good way to vet 911 calls. I've only ever had one legitimate emergency on a text to 911 line and the texting was unnecessary that it ended as a phone conversation.",

Man in car politely declined to answer her question about what he was doing when lady asked him. She calls him out for taking photos of kids .,yells he's a pedophile ,other people come over.Police are called ,guy with camera get his photo taken ,put on facebook with the comment \"guy taking pictures of our kids ,etc..Comments start coming in ,everyone sharing his photo to keep an eye out for him.some of the macho dads  want to go beat the guy up.... Police arrive ,it gets sorted out..The guy is a Real Estate appraiser/didnt have any photos of kids on his camera..\n\nWe can chalk it up to a misunderstanding ,but the social media postings ,and threats could have been avoided,and are there forever now.\n\nWe will have plenty of time scream for the persons job when the facts come out.\n\nWe tripled up on Richard Jewell years ago.

Sadly there are just trash humans out there who find themselves in such jobs. There are seas of accounts of medical workers, social workers, police and other people in positions which call for a little empathy degrading folks and treating them like shit. I can believe it!",

The amount of pushback the industry STILL has about things as simple as making sites screen reader friendly is infuriating.\n\nBut here's the thing.  Things structured for accessibility are typically structured better in general, so everyone - not just those who need the features - benefits.  Screen reader optimized sites are easier to use without a mouse, usually easier to style because the elements are ordered well, etc.  Color palettes optimized for color blind people?  Guess what, they're easier for everyone to see too.  Wheelchair ramps?  You won't mind those when you sprain your ankle or your knee hurts from running too much and stairs suck.  Also, great for moving furniture on coasters!\n\nThe list could go on and on, but yes - making things accessible for those that need it almost always helps those who don't too.",

Gotta say this sounds to me like a racist dispatcher saw a name that came up for the number, a location the call came from, the lady's speech, etc that tipped her off and she probably just hung up. Either way we have a white supremacist shooter in a nation that has a white supremacist police system so even if I'm wrong about this individual dispatcher it's a little irrelevant overall.",

What are the way this would be done?\n\n1. Malice - lying to hurt the person accused, or to make oneself look heroic, or thinking that faking things is best for the community.\n\n2. Incompetence - pursuing the wrong outcome by mistake.\n\nEveryone expects the dispassionate starting point in the court of law. Innocent until proven guilty is no insult there. A victim is well aware of how things go legally.\n\nBut in public, or private, to take that stance, is to say, \"I don't believe you.\"\n\nVictim: \"This horrible thing happened to me.\"\n\nPerson: \"I'm going to take a step back and not say anything at this juncture.

I guess, just to add, it comes off as more awkward because it's essentially a live interview and typically we expect a bit of empathy when hearing about an unfortunate circumstance in a [semi] intimate setting.\n\nI'm a classically trained broadcast journalist, and while I think cold reporting is certainly something we could use more of in modern times, I also understand that when you're trying to do an empathetic piece, with someone who went through the traumatizing event, I don't think there's any fault in saying something like, \"Thank you Laetitia for telling your account of the situation.  I'm sure we all can understand how frustrating this must have been for you.\"  Honestly, sounds like the guy stumbled at the gravity of the situation and just dumped to a generic, safe, \"well, that sucks\" response.  I'm not faulting him, I'm just saying I don't doubt even he, upon review, probably wishes he used slightly different language to round that thought out.\n\nWhile that isn't full-on cold reporting, I feel that it's not too out of line to have some broad-strokes empathy neutrally applied to a situation for the sake of the traumatized interviewee, and the audience listening in, who most, assumingly, feel compassion for this victim and don't want to see them traumatized further.",

Chances are you're in a moderate-high call volume area where if police responded to every 911-hangup they wouldn't be able to respond in a timely manner (if they even can in the first place) to confirmed calls.\n\nI've worked at an agency where if there's nothing on the other line or it's a hangup, you disconnect and move onto the next call since the phone is constantly ringing and the next 911 line you pick up has been ringing for over 30 seconds already.\n\nI work at an agency where if a phone dials 911, you dispatch police to whatever location you can figure out for them (sometimes a wireless phone ping, sometimes a landline, sometimes we just know the phone number and know where the caller lives) and you keep calling back until you can speak to someone and confirm there's no emergency.\n\nNow take a guess which one the agency underpays and doesn't give a fuck about you and can't hire anyone of value, and take a guess which one pays decently and attracts more experienced dispatchers and officers.",

Not much they can do if your phone goes straight to voicemail and we cant ping your phone location unless we know its an emergency..great way to lose your job during the audit",

I've heard crazy shit like \"Mind your business\" when reporting a cab driver for repeatedly crossing the line on both sides of the street, going head on into oncoming traffic and hitting the curb on the right to \"Why didn't you stop and move it\" when I called to report a mattress in the left lane on the down side of an overpass on the Interstate at night with no shoulder to stop on.\n\nI asked the operator if I should wait to call back when the cab hits someone and she said \"Yes.\" I told the operator who asked why I didn't stop to move the mattress on the road that's why we have DOT motorist assistance trucks and State Troopers with flashing lights and the authority to stop traffic.\n\nThen there was the domestic situation on the road side in Texas. I told her I was taking my mother-in-law to the cardiologist when we saw a domestic dispute on the shoulder where the man was chasing after the woman. She asked why I didn't pull over to stop him. Like, bitch! Are you fucking crazy? Domestic disputes are one of the most dangerous calls cops go on and you expect me to stop taking my mother-in-law to the doctor with a life threatening condition to interject myself into a domestic dispute with not gun to defend myself and no authority to make him stop?\n\nStupid bitches. All of them should have been fired. They have no business handling emergencies.",

She said I'd need the case number which was written in the living room, where he was. She kept telling me to speak up while I'm whispering so he doesn't find me.  She said I'd have to call back with it and just reported it as roommate's fighting. Fortunately he didn't search the whole house because he cut an artery reaching through the window. There was blood everywhere. We were still finding blood drops when we moved out years later. I had time to sweep up the glass and sit on the porch for a long time before a cop showed.

Horrifying. I call 911, but I'm new to the town and didn't know the name of the cemetery. I gave cross streets, figuring they can find it, it's an enormous cemetery, I'm sure they'll see it. Then just roll down your window and listen for the screams! \n\nShe said she needed an address, like I was a fuckin moron. So I gave her the address of my apartment complex, and said to be sure to tell them that's not it though, they have to go to the cemetery behind it. She asked for the name of the cemetery. I lost my fucking mind at that point, yelling that I hoped she had at least started the dispatch, because this man is going to die while you fuck around! \n\nAt one point she said she could Google it (!!!!) And then LAUGHED about something, I don't even remember what. My blood pressure went through the roof, I'm surprised I didn't have a stroke. \n\nPolice ended up coming to the apartment complex, of course. Then they had to try and scale the fence, failed, and got back in their cars to circle the block and go to the cemetery. Then they had to call an ambulance, because the stupid bitch hadn't considered that a beating victim would also need medical attention. \n\nSomehow, amazingly, despite the absolute incompetence and disregard for human life shown by the entire law enforcement group, that man survived. Modern medicine is fucking amazing. \n\nAnd I had to move because I was now known as a snitch. Thanks, bitch.",

Anyway, definitely read the article and don't listen to my dumbass.",

Either something is worth getting upset about & the reporters get upset. Or it's not, so the reporters don't. And, no, I'm not advocating that they get all emotional on-screen. But normal empathy for someone who has gone through a traumatic experience - or even someone who *thinks* they have gone through a traumatic experience - should be standard. Otherwise, the reporters aren't just spreading news. They're spreading the concept that such things don't NEED empathy and shouldn't GET empathy.",

We have a saying in the biz, \"never be the dispatcher who ends up on the news\" because the ONLY time a dispatcher ends up on the news, its because they fucked up.\n\nI'm not here to defend dispatchers everywhere, because I realize that there are bad ones out there who do not deserve their headset. I also have no idea how Buffalo runs their dispatch center b/c I worked in North Texas.\n\nI was trained that if a caller is whispering, it is an indication they are afraid their life may be in danger. There is no reason that I would ask a caller to raise their voice, not when I have at least 3 tools at my disposal to communicate with a caller who can't/won't speak.\n\nThat being said, in an active shooter situation, I was very specifically trained that once I have gathered all the information the caller can give me, I am to hang up and answer the next call. If I have an active shooter in my jurisdiction, we will recieve so many calls it is not physically possible to even answer all of them. We cannot stay on the line to comfort victims or keep people calm. In the case of my center, we have a max of 6 people working at a time. With a population of over 200,000 people. That is six people who have to answer incoming emergency and non emergency calls, dispatch fire, police, and EMS responses, and coordinate those responses on the radio.\n\nThe one time I actually did have to handle an active shooter, not only was I answering 911 phone calls, I was dispatching and coordinating every police response in my jurisdiction that was NOT the shooting, as well as running names/license plates/driver's licenses/ warrants for ALL the officers in my jurisdiction. I had 4 other coworkers at the time and they were just as busy.\n\nLike I said, I am not defending this particular dispatcher in any way. I am just providing a bit of prospective from someone who was on the other side of the phone.",

Spoiler alert...she died.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhwjC3oXwlQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhwjC3oXwlQ)\n\nThis is just a newscast with parts of the call. If you want to be absolutely gut wrenched and possibly traumatized, heres the full call.  Just completely breaks my heart esp with how polite she was and how she kept apologizing for being scared cause of how annoyed it was making the dispatcher. And that this was the person she had to spend her last moments in life with.  Effing gut wrenching.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=731o6Djjtz4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=731o6Djjtz4)",

The 911 dispatchers in my country had very good training for the most part. This needs elaboration which I\u2019m happy to give.. it can be confusing so stay with me. I will just speak for my county, but many places are similar. \n\nFirst off of you pick up the phone and call 911, it\u2019s routed first (no matter what) to the sheriffs office. From there, (depending on the nature of the call) it stays there or is re dispatched to EMS/Fire. Which was the same where I\u2019m from. That\u2019s why if you ever call 911 and tell them what\u2019s going on and they put you on hold for a moment\u2026. They are kicking the call to EMS services most likely. Anyway, from there, you will speak likely to a call taker (possibly a dispatcher, just depends) at first. The call taker will figure out who and where you are and the nature of the problem. While this happens the call taker sends the info to the dispatch her (literally as you speak to them) you probably won\u2019t talk to a dispatcher from where I\u2019m from. The dispatcher uses the information to route an ambulance or fire truck, both for all priority 1 calls (life threatening) this is because float firefighters are EMT certified or at least MFR (medical first responders) and if they beat ems on scene, they can begin rendering care. that\u2019s the nature of call taking and dispatching in a nut shell. \n\nHere is the part people want to know, about the training. Where I am from, ALL CALL TAKERS AND DISPATCHERS ARE EMT-B at a minimum before they even qualify to be a dispatcher. As well as having many hours of ride alongside in the field. We did so many ride slings and I loved it so much. This is a very very high standard being adopted more and more across the country. The dispatch schooling is very intense and pays more than all senior medics around here. And for good reason. They need to have (at times) the ability to talk to many people at once, read and write while they do it. NEVER MAKE BIG MISTAKES, reading maps, programs, dispatching calls, moving units around ETC\u2026 It\u2019s a very very hard, high stress job, that takes real professionals that are paid well to do it. The dispatchers I know personally are awesome people and badass at their jobs. I love them. They have saved my ass more than once. Literally my life one time. Another story for another day. \n\nOk here is the bad news, many many places in this country need the bodies in those dispatching rooms, therefore the standards are much lower in some places over others. The inner cities, poor communities in general, the standards low. Dang where from 122-232 hours is the average. That may seem like a lot, but I had to do over 1100 hours for EMT-B, EMT-S, and then Paramedic. (EMT-P). Along with my other 3 out of license Certs (accounting for about 350 of those hours.) I was working through this and it\u2019s a very very high standard where I am from. Not the norm. \n\nIt\u2019s like anything, there are some places that I would be happy to have medics come save my life, other places I know I\u2019d rather drive to the ER and hopefully not die. It\u2019s sad but true. \n\nThe person hanging up on her is sick and ducking bullshit. That person (if this is true) should be criminally held accountable for her actions. Anyone having questions please hit me up. Happy to answer anything related to this. (It\u2019s my little wheel house)",

Many PSAP's use a protocol system to avoid situations such as this, and while they can be cumbersome they provide specific instructions to provide for callers in danger to help them stay safe until help arrives in a standardized fashion that can be given the same way everytime by any dispatcher regardless of skill level.",

People were scratching at his windows (I ascertained he lived on the 3rd floor so not possible). Through all the gibberish I kept listening for any signs of, well, anything. I kept asking him where he was, he kept saying locked inside. But I could hear external noise like he was outside. The veteran operators started cracking it at me as i exceeded the recommended 20mins to wrap up the call and the call queue was high. But something wasn\u2019t right, and he kept talking about the roof which made me edgy. Anyway I trusted my gut and hit the escalation button. That alerts the remote supervisor who makes call to send details to cops or not. He wasn\u2019t buying it but I pushed hard. He alerted the cops and they responded about 7hrs later. They found him stuck on the roof, 5 floors up, dehydrated, and having \u2018probed\u2019 himself with a screwdriver. He survived.",

I apologize if I trigger anyone.\n\nI was held at gunpoint by my (step)father over 20 years ago. This was back in the before times of landlines. My mom got a bad feeling when she called home to tell me to start dinner one afternoon when I was a teenager and called 911. They called the house instead of just sending police. I answered the phone while my (step)father listened on the other line. Which is why landlines were scary back in the day. They didn\u2019t pick up on my distress and told my Mom I was fine. She insisted I wasn\u2019t and they called me again. Crazy, right? I tried a different \u201cvoice\u201d more robotic, like the actual impression of a robot, while last time was very formal with yes Ma\u2019am and no Ma\u2019am. What teenager does that with a scared and shaky voice? Not sure how I didn\u2019t get shot after that. Anyway, 2nd Dispatcher that called was the same woman. I was hoping she\u2019d notice the change in tone. Nope! No one came for me for more than four hours. I don\u2019t know who my Mom convinced to come get me eventually but, the police finally did and (step)father immediately surrendered on the front lawn. That whole day is still a blur.\n\nEven as an adult, I don\u2019t like calling 911. I\u2019ve had to do it a few times since then and it\u2019s always been weird. So, I\u2019m getting to the point where I\u2019m not surprised anymore.",

She had no way of defending herself. I put myself in between her and the dog, and kicked at the dog to dissuade it from coming closer. It did not get dissuaded til i actually kicked it when it tried to bite me. Now, the dispatcher had hung up...in the span of what took maybe 5 seconds. Multiple people had been bitten already and multiple calls to police and animal control but neither had shown up after an hour. What finally stopped it, was the store owner coming out with a shotgun and putting the dog down. After biting what seemed like at least 10 people, the police finally showed up after someone called to report the store owner shot the dog after it bit many people and police and animal control refused to show up. After he shot the dog, they were there in what felt like 30s.",

Their negative dialogue and rhetoric toward the black community resonates at their home and continues on the job. I hope that prejudice is not the reason she was rude to the caller, but its hard not to think otherwise. If you look up police misconduct on the Buffalo force, it is alarming, and continuous. People who live in the community are not serving the community, they are commuting to an area to serve with a predisposed notion of, \u201cit\u2019s a bad part of town.\u201d",

Being silent on the line makes sense obviously, but it also makes sense that an operator would be frustrated and trying to move to a call that can provide information. This is NOT, even under stress, how an operator should behave at any point, but there are factors here that do make this a big deviation from the norm for all involved.

All of a sudden I see long black poles flying down the freeway coming towards me. I managed to swerve and dodge them but I could see more of them falling off the back of the truck. I called 911 and then they redirected me to a police officer who was on patrol in the area. The line cuts and I hear \u201chello?\u201d I say \u201chi is this the police department?\u201d  He replies \u201cUHHHH YEAHHH!? YOU CALLED ME!?\u201d \nAt that point I was thinking like why the fuck did you answer the phone like that? I wasn\u2019t about to argue with this dude tho so I just I told him exactly what was happening and he asks which way the truck was going. I tell him I\u2019m not sure but he\u2019s going towards this town so most likely north. He goes \u201cWELL THATS IMPOSSIBLE THAT FREEWAY ONLY GOES EAST OR WEST AND IF YOURE GOING TO THAT TOWN ITS DEFINITELY WEST\u201d I really wanted to tell this man to fuck off but I kept it cool and said \u201cwell you got the information you needed. Have a good day\u201d I was so livid on how he handled that shit. Like sorry I almost got killed by some cast iron pipe and I\u2019m still in shock so I\u2019m not gonna know what fucking direction this car was moving. He was being such a smart ass.

You can send them your info and the situation and they will call the police or any service needed, or in case of following and stalking they'll just pretend to be your friend and you talk to them until you are safely at home, because if at phone or video call a stalker or follower is less likely to attack you cause there's a testimony.

I ended up being protected somewhat because my mom had fallen into me and then grabbed me, kind of like a shield. The only people in the house were myself, my mother, and my younger brother who was a year and a bit old, and stranded at the top of the stairs. My mother was stuck on the floor and couldn't move. I had to go call 911 and talk to the operator by myself. I don't remember much of what she told me because I was a toddler but I remember she was basically just refusing to send over an ambulance until she was sure a healthy adult could be with the kids. I don't even think I need to explain how stupid that is considering we called because our healthy adult wasn't healthy. Eventually my mother whispered to me to tell her someone was coming for the kids. \n\nThen the paramedics arrived and were even dumber. We still didn't have anyone with us and they were incredibly annoyed when a little kid answered the door. They started attending to my mother and one of them sat me down on the stairs to inspect me. My wrist and head were hurting but the paramedic told me I was fine (I wasn't) and then the paramedics refused to take my brother and I on the ambulance with them. I don't know if there are rules about that kind of stuff but seriously I can't imagine they couldn't have taken us with them. So then I had to call up all my relatives to see who could watch us. Thank god we had all the phone numbers hung up on the fridge because I really don't know what we would have done then. I got through like six relatives before my grandfather was able to come watch us. \n\nThe people at the hospital released my mother on THE SAME DAY despite her being unable to fucking walk (and later we found out had broken a rib). My grandfather wouldn't stand for it and took us to our family doctor (who was also related to us). He told us what was wrong with my mother and found out I had a cut on the back of my head and had bled some from there. \n\nThankfully my mother can still walk and move around but she's always struggled more because of what happened. Some people truly are idiots.",
