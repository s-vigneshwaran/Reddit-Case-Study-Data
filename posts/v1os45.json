Yes, even the women who vote for them, are against *other* women having rights. They think rules being put in place won't be applied to them as stringently, thus giving them an advantage.

They claim they need their guns 'to defend from a tyrannical government' but really they're champing at the bit to BE the tyrannical government. They love nothing more than to be deputized by the state or God to go around inflicting harm on others. They barely even care what the group they're oppressing is, as long as they get to be the oppressors, they're happy. Whether that's roving gangs lynching people of certain races, or having to be satisfied with just voting to make their lives worse with a smug smile on their faces and claiming its because 'they just like small government' when trying to maintain social status in polite company, they just want to hurt others. They view life as a competition and that means making sure others lose.",

Hell, I hold the opinion it's strictly a cultural problem in this country. It's the people, not the guns. \n\nWhether it's a member of a gang, or someone that is at the breaking point of doing a mass shooting, someone being on site with a gun is not going to stop them from attempting their actions.   All it does it force them to bring about more powerful weapons than someone may carry. Someone that is accepting of violence as a solution is not scared of someone else having a gun. \n\nIf they came with solutions on their end, the toxicity towards guns in this country, especially for those gun owners that are responsible, wouldn't be so tense. Instead the rhetoric comes down to \"don't move an inch because they'll take a mile\" in terms of guns, despite reality showing otherwise. Now they want to say it's a mental illness problem, yet they won't, and don't want to fund any programs that may address these issues.",
