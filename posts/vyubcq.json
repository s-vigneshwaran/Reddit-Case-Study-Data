You could ask him any question related to IT and he'd immediately talk word for word like he was reading it right from a book. Tested well always had a 4.0. But he was always pissed off at me cause I was the only intern for various IT classes and he was always rejected. I had maybe a 2.6 grade average. Reason is when it came to applying anything he was clueless. Needed someone to hold his hand. He brings in his PC once saying he couldn't get the sound to work. Then flops his case on it's side with out even shutting down pulls out his sound card blows on it then jams it back in like we did with the old SNES games \"see it doesn't work\"  this was 18 years ago. Today he's an insurance sellsman. I went on to work for the government for 11 years before opening my own business and am sure you can all tell I failed English. 3 times lol. \n\nWe measure intelligence based on how much a person knows and how quickly they can answer questions. You can be a pro with those and still not have the ability to tie you own shoes with out help. Btw no I didn't pass highschool. I kept failing English so I faked my high school diploma from a made up none accredited school (legal btw in my state anyways) went to collage learned nothing got a bachelor's in information systems and never used it once.",

A GPA is reflective of how well you can do what you\u2019re told, and you often lose points for being more creative than what was instructed. I couldn\u2019t stand that, constantly being told my work ethic was trash because my GPA was too. Only for me to enter the working world and get promoted for just doing what I do. \n\nHow well you do in school most definitely does not equate to how well you\u2019ll do in life.",

He got to a prestigious university and just straight up rejected the teachings of critical thinking and sociology. He said it was nonsense. People can be indoctrinated to ignore the scientific method. Religion plays a huge part in indoctrinating children away from critical thinking. \n\nI would say religion is the single greatest threat to critical thinking today. Please don't raise your children with religion. It is taking their valid questions about the universe and giving them a made up answer from 1500 years ago. And they base their entire personality on the foundations they build with those nonsense materials. If you believe everything has a higher authority leading up to god, you may have serious problems learning to critically question anything that is tied to the authority of god. This leads to people ignoring reality to protect their own belief pillars they have had since childhood. If they were never given these vague weak pillars of religion they may have developed emotional skills that more closely reflect reality, and not some vague book from tribal warfare times.",

There's also plenty that come from less diverse and educated backgrounds who embrace the new experiences college provides, which is where you get kids that go off to college then come back very different. Of course, this feeds into the whole college-is-indoctrination for those who don't like the changes that kids go through in college.\n\nIt doesn't help that the US has created a culture where people are more concerned with what they can do versus what they should do. They *can* ignore things that challenge their ideals and make them uncomfortable, so they don't care that they probably should try expanding their horizons a bit. I've got a coworker that prides himself on his low vocabulary and how he never reads. Interestingly (and frighteningly) enough, there was a conversation at work about what people would do if the purge was a real thing, and he said he'd start shooting up colleges and people with bumper stickers of the opposite political party. I bet you can guess which party he doesn't like.",

It seems like an easy choice to me but the second is illegal and will get you thrown into prison and ruin your life. Meanwhile alcohol alone is related to a weekly accident and emergency surge every weekend, what a drain on the system.\n\nPeople can throw up with too much weed, everyone is different but alcohol is extra nasty. I've yet to meet a person who has tried both extremes and prefers the alcohol hangover. \n\nI don't fault people for enjoying alcohol but it seems messed up that's the default normal drug of choice for a lot of countries. THC allows your brain to keep firing and experience dopamine while alcohol will float your dopamine system with reward. There both reward circuits drugs but one attacks the lock while the other just throws as many keys as possible.\n\nThey are both drugs but the way alcohol people pretend it isn't a drug while looking down on drugs just hits me the wrong way. I enjoy both but weed is more forgiving if you take it too far, alcohol on the other hand can kill you.\n\nTo me it's the unfairness of it. It's like there's only 1 personality type that's allowed and that's early morning workers who enjoy coffee (drug that makes you productive and ups) and then drink a downer after work to relax. Problem is brain chemistry is different, alcohol can do nothing for others while still (because of reward system) make them addicted. I just find it strange that people don't realise these are drugs that people take every day (so do I, but I recognise they are drugs so I won't judge a coke user for example).",

It\u2019s also definitely possible to have so much that you throw up or feel really unwell or uncomfortable, and tbh the mental side effects of overconsumption can be a lot worse with weed than with alcohol. I think this is also a somewhat newer phenomenon, the strength that some modern cannabis products have make it really easy to accidentally overdo it, especially if you\u2019re a novice and/or using edibles.\n\n\nI\u2019m not saying that weed is categorically as bad or worse than alcohol because I don\u2019t think it is, but it\u2019s far from being totally harmless either even if it\u2019s unlikely to kill you directly, and being honest about both the potential pros and cons is an important part of the discussion we need to have around it.",

I was more talking about how alcohol can have someone puking then \"passing out\" but they wake up not feeling rested. With weed people can sleep for 12 hours. REM sleep in both is being prevented so that's a long term use issue but in the moment I would choose a weed sleep over alcohol. Alcohol is like playing catchup the next day trying to make up for the mistake of last night. Like a single drop of water can make you sick but you need to the fluids.\n\nTo your next point you are correct but you need to remember we are basically in the moonshine days of alcohol with weed. With alcohol illegal if you're making it then if you're caught there wasn't a difference between low abv versus high so you got a race to the top and it made moonshine. Look at today and you have low abv bears and ciders.\n\nWeed did the same thing with THC which got pushed to the ceiling. How many people do you know that go straight for moonshine as the drink of choice? Same with THC and CBD, people don't have the choice and are given high THC and low CBC (which counteracts the THC). \n\nI'm fine with discussing it, I consider weed a drug and it has many negatives. I just think we already have a hard core drug called alcohol it's hard to argue it's overall more damaging that alcohol. Both drugs will have their own unique negatives to the brain, since it's an external drug after all.\n\nIf it was 10x as deadly sure I can understand it being illegal but not when we clearly have the drug alcohol around and the majority are fine with that. It's really the hypocrisy to me. It's like banning butter but saying chocolate is alright.\n\nI think the whole \"weed is harmless\" argument is just a knee jerk reaction to having to get over that high standard hill. They see drugs in society that are allowed and wonder why this other drug is illegal so an injustice has been done so they go further in the other way. To be honest people want it illegal because it smells, as if we already ban products that other humans might find smelly. So the people over selling this aren't doing any favours but I get why they are arguing from that place, because the discussions doesn't seem fair. For example I can mention all the negatives for alcohol and it's still illegal but people will use any of the negatives to cannabis to keep it illegal. Doesn't seems fair in my opinion.",

It directly affects your reward system which is why its very addictive by flooding your brain with dopamine while also sutting down your risk reward circuits so another drink at the time seems like a good idea. Dopamine is the neurotransporter that makes you want to do anything. Every completed a long term project and felt great? Dopamine, every enjoyed a nice carb heavy pasta or pizza? Dopamine.\n\nHonestly there is a reason we can't get rid of it from society and it's because it's addictive and attacks your reward circuits which drives nearly everything you do.",

During the summer I would regularly stay up until like 4-6 am because I simply couldn't sleep. My dad is the same way. He's 72 and takes Ambien regularly, the problem is that his insurance company is being a dick and wont pay for this refills so he hasn't had it in months. Weed became legal in my state last year, so I openly smoke when I'm spending the weekend there. I've suggested that he should look into weed as a sleep aid because it has worked for me for 20 years, but he always says no.",

At one of my former jobs, the CEO of a high frequency stock trading company in NYC, who was a billionaire, was a huge stoner and would openly smoke at our company parties.

It's so harmful that nearly half of the US has legalized it, and it has been shown to have medicinal properties. You've been brainwashed by the media into believing that it's some life destroying substance, youths don't \"waste their lives\" on it, that's absolutely ridiculous. The only way that happens is by getting arrested for selling or possession. \n\nWe have normalized caffeine consumption so much that you look at a stimulant, that has a defined level at which it will kill half of the subjects given that amount (that's what an LD50 is in case you weren't aware) as perfectly safe, yet you view a depressant, which has no known LD50 as detrimental/unsafe and life destroying.

I even worked in some offices where they'd occasionally drink in the office. \n\n- So many commercials for alcohol where drinking alcohol makes you cool, sexy, and awesome\n\n- People casually talking about binge drinking is pretty common, and most people wouldn't even think twice about someone telling an anecdote related to binge drinking\n\nIt's just super easy to be an alcoholic without even realizing it, because a lot of (what I believe to be) problematic habits/behaviors are considered totally normal and even reinforced.",

I mean yeah I do have friends I can go out with and just not drink and it's not a problem. It's not so much a big deal now as it was a pain in the ass in like.. college. Like I tried very hard haha. It's just mainly with new people in social situations. And yeah maybe I made it seem like it bothered me more than it does. It's mostly just annoying and I was just tryna agree in the sense that yeah... people seem to find it very difficult to accept or treat it like I'm judging them or something. Like I really don't care how much you drink or don't drink. But I think a lot of people maybe are insecure about how much they drink so find it very uncomfortable and maybe project some judgment that isn't there. Like I would be drinking with you if I could do it without feeling immediately miserable but a lot just don't seem to want to / can't get that. I think that could be part of the reason why drinking seems so commonplace / encouraged a lot of the time",

None of us realised how most of our life it was him showing up sober and we always tried to push alcohol onto him. Writing it now it sounds like pushing drugs onto someone (which is what it is) but in the culture is like offering a biscuit or a coffee to someone. People just go out drinking and it's something people look forward to as a young person.\n\nIt's hard to describe to someone who hasn't been drunk but the need for everyone around you to also take part feels like a bonding event. When someone doesn't take part its like a strange thing. Everyone drunk can be stupid and lower their guard but the sober person can put everyone on guard again.\n\nAll this is too say I don't think people who are pushing alcohol onto others realise how bad that must seem from the non drinkers perspective. Young people especially won't have a clue, at least here you are the black sheep if you don't drink after you turn 18.",

I'd declined past opportunities when I'd been sober.  \n\nThe first time I smoked meth (a drug I swore I'd stay away from) was after a few drinks.  \n\nIf alcohol isn't the gateway I don't think gateways exist.  \n\nAlso I read some studies when I was researching addiction that basically said almost every addict started their drug use with alcohol. I work in addiction services now and most of the meth/opiate users have told me they don't drink anymore because it was a bigger problem to them. They preferred a meth or opiate addiction to an alcohol addiction, before they started the journey to getting clean. Addiction isn't the substance so much as the need to fuck with your brain chemistry, that chasing the feeling of happiness that's missing from life. You take away a meth heads meth and they'll start using a different drug.  \n\nAlmost every single one started off getting drunk.",

I drink 2 cups a day max, more days none or one.

I could've worded it better, but I meant 5 or maybe even 10 cups extra after getting the shakes. So for me that could be about 11-16 cups in 6 hours. For you that might be 30-35 cups.

I have very expensive machines and the return on investment gets worse as you go up.\n\nAnyway so that's been me, I've been taking a drug for 10 years during arguably the most important brain development area of my whole life. We know caffeine basically takes what it gives to you over time. Your sleep quality and REM sleep time gets worse. What you initially experience as an energy boost over time is actually your baseline of cognition being lowered and when you consume caffeine again it's raised backup to the original baseline. You also go through withdrawal symptoms over night so that first cup in the morning is to remove the withdrawal symptoms. You would feel more rested and awake if you quit coffee.\n\nAdenosine builds up in the brain and caffine binds to the receptors that Adenosine wants to bind to. Adenosine makes you sleepy so caffeine stops that from affecting you for a short time. Adenosine still builds up and the brain recognises it isn't being depleated so it creates more. \n\nEventually (half life of caffeine is like 12 hours) it goes away and all that Adenosine suddenly binds all at once created a crashing feeling. Naturally that would of been gradual throughout the day instead of the coffee crash. That encourages additional caffine dosage which continues the cycle of being sleep and having no energy so you take a drug that over time makes you more sleepy and have less energy.\n\nThat's the addiction loop and cycle. There's no way that doesn't have an affect of brain development. Probably is people don't consider it a drug so you don't think twice about it when society encourages it (there's a reason work places want you to consume it).\n\nI'm currently going through a 1 month give up of caffeine and I'm like \"where did all the anxiety and panic go to? Oh it's was the caffeine. Road rage, I'm more patient if a light turns on me. The \"urge\" to do something is gone but it was always useless to me because I never had a clue what to do with that energy (executive function issues).\n\nHands shaking all the time? No problem I'll just supplement L-Theine to counter act all the negatives. For me caffeine gave me a dopamine hit so I would keep hitting it then I was miserable being over caffeinated, can't relax at all or be in peace. Daily dopamine fix's for years makes me wonder how the brain adapts to that, does it reduce the amount of dopamine you experience? I almost experientially think so. The world is more interesting and I'm more motivated when I quit it for a while.\n\nMy ranting is raving is just to say it's a drug and while the majority might not think it affects them it certainly did to me.",

Adenosine still builds up and the brain recognises it isn't being depleated so it creates more. \n\nI had never heard of that, and just decided to look it up because I know what ATP (Adenosine TriPhosphate) is pretty much the main form of energy for your body, then I read this:\n\n\"The principal component of cannabis delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) induce sleep in rats by increasing adenosine levels in the basal forebrain. They also significantly increase slow-wave sleep during the third hour, mediated by CB1 receptor activation. These findings identify a potential therapeutic use of cannabinoids to induce sleep in conditions where sleep may be severely attenuated.[34]\"\n\nTIL.\n\nI was/am also a huge caffeine addict, largely to combat my inability to fall asleep at a regular time. I used to take Stacker 2s in high school because it would give me a huge caffeine rush in the morning (it was like 200 mg of caffeine and like 300 mg of ephedra, as you might have guessed it was banned like 2 years later because its horrible for your body). Throughout college I would slam back Monster energy drinks and Starbucks Double Shots in the morning to wake me up. \n\nNow, thankfully, I can go into work whenever I want, so I usually fall asleep around 1-4 AM, and usually sign on at 11 AM, and then I have a single cup of coffee.",

Being addicted to caffeine doesn't mean that you're all cracked out and fiending for it. Drinking a cup of coffee every day/the typical \"don't talk to me until I've had my coffee\" is an example of caffeine addiction. It's a joke, I get that, but it's also true.  If you don't drink any caffeinated beverages for like a day or two and you feel like crap or have a headache, you're addicted and going through withdrawal.",

I have a sex drive but I also knew and was content that Id end up only marginally less sexually frustrated when I instigated. \n\nWeed has been incredibly helpful to get into a headspace where I can genuinely experience sexual pleasure/ orgasms and that was invaluable to learning how to recreate that headspace sober.",

So it's either I pay out the ass for something that is either going to do nothing to me (the usual case) or it's going to straight up knock me out after like 45 minutes. Also eating weed is way more psychedelic than smoking it, I don't wanna be that messed up every day.\n\nI have both an Herbalizer and Volcano Hybrid, (never use the former anymore, the company went out of business hence the reason I bought the Volcano). I use the Volcano often, but it doesn't give the same level of intoxication that smoking does. If I crank the temp up to release all the cannabinoids it starts to burn the herb and the resulting smoke/vapor is really hot, even with a water filter. \n\nI also have a handheld Davinci IQ2 herbal vape, and a oil vape. The herb vape takes way too long to get me sufficiently baked (like 20+ minutes since it shuts off after 6 minutes) and the oils don't do much to me anymore since my tolerance is so high.\n\nI always go back to ripping bongs because it's the most effective and efficient, but my lungs and sinuses definitely don't like it.",

There are definitely some individuals that will not benefit from cannabis, some especially that have adverse reactions.  And there are definitely long lasting effects on developing brains that still have high plasticity.  Do you have a problem with those that have a beer every night?  Or a cocktail after dinner most nights?  Do you disparage people that take antidepressants?  Both of those have far far worse side effects than cannabis.  How about caffeine, far more harmful to the body and cardiovascular system.  I advocate for cannabis use for those it\u2019s beneficial to or as an alternative to alcohol or other recreational drugs as it\u2019s massively less harmful.  I advocate cannabis over most anti-anxiety or anti-depressants (if it\u2019s effective for the individual) for the same reasons, the cost-benefit analysis leans far in favor of cannabis.  I vehemently endorse cannabis for those with certain seizure disorders or multiple sclerosis as other treatments are massively more harmful than cannabis.\n\nI suspect you\u2019re thinking of folks that take massive doses to see how much they can handle, I\u2019m strongly against any type of binging behavior, be it weed, alcohol, porn, sex, etc.  Though everything in moderation including moderation, so an occasional long weekend bender of any of these things may add a net benefit to the experience of living life.",

Eating refined carbs, drinking excessive amounts of caffeine, breathing in air in cities with air quality problems, driving more than 20 miles a day, remaining seated for stretches longer than an hour, all of these have negative health effects that far outshine anything cannabis could cause.  \n\n\nSo with all due respect, screw you and screw your weird stance on this \\*nearly\\* harmless plant.

Grow the fuck up, that's not how the world works. Sorry you were taught that drugs are a black and white issue or that your only experience with them was too much for you to handle, but tons of people are able to function in society under the influence of drugs and tons of people aren't able to function under the influence of alcohol. Idk what else to say at this point because you clearly are just bigoted towards anyone who makes decisions you don't like.

Ironically marijuana is as much a gateway drug as Alcohol and nicotine, they prime the brain for a heightened response to other drugs and are typically used before a person progresses to other, more harmful substances.\n\n[An alternative to the gateway-drug hypothesis is that people who are more vulnerable to drug-taking are simply more likely to start with readily available substances such as marijuana, tobacco, or alcohol, and their subsequent social interactions with others who use drugs increases their chances of trying other drugs. Further research is needed to explore this question.](https://nida.nih.gov/publications/research-reports/marijuana/marijuana-gateway-drug)",

Dude the problem is you, not the weed, you are smoking the wrong kind, you are smoking at the wrong time, you are smoking with the wrong people.\n\nSeems you're getting defensive already. No I'm literally not going about it the same way by doing the opposite. They were coercing you,manipulative,  and dismissive of your mental health.

Because I quit.

      "text": "As devil's advocate (I guess?) I feel like, as much as weed IS obviously not as bad as alcohol, and as much as alcohol is way more likely to get you into other drugs, I think the problem with weed is just the fact that it's illegal, from my point of view, THAT right there is the \"gateway\" I don't have anything against weed smokers or weed on its own, but in my opinion I don't find it appropriate how cool everyone is with smoking weed illegaly, and before I get there, I would like to add that I would love to see weed be completely legalized. \n\nBut my point is, young people today love weed, it is entirely acceptable for high schoolers to break the law nowadays and buy drugs from dealers because weed's \"all good\" or because they think they \"won't get addicted\" or a plethora of reasons they will find online that will convince them it's good to do it. And that on it's own is already bad, unless you have a specific condition, it is never good for you to take ANY drugs, period, as much as weed is one of the better ones, you're simply better off not doing it, again unless you have a condition that may benefit from it, and secondly, it's putting you in touch with dealers who make their living selling unregulated shit to kids, a lot of dealers will rip you off, or sell you something bad, and a lot more will also offer worse shit too, and in my opinion that's a big problem, if kids nowadays weren't so used to buying weed off of dealers and have it be accepted and cool then maybe it would be a bit harder for them to also find coke, meth, or heroin. Buying alcohol at the corner store does not give you an idea of how to get meth, buying weed, does.\n\nAnd lastly, and something more unrelated, is that many don't see that when they buy shit illegaly you are supporting people you very likely don't want to be supporting. Who do you think got those drugs to you? Where did your dealer get it from? The truth is, a good chunk of them are not growing a small amount of weed plants in their garage. There's all sorts of shit going from gangs to fully fledged cartels depending on where you're at.\n\nSo as much as alcohol is a worse drug, I still believe illegal weed is a worse thing to be involved with, I'm not gonna demonize kids for it, but that's my view anyways, I'm American, born in Mexico and let me tell you, it borders on depressing every time I see how cartels in Mexico have made uncountable amounts off cash off of Americans who don't think where the money is going to, and don't realize the hundreds of thousands of people that die through that. So in summary to this thing that nobody asked for: Yes, weed better than alcohol, but illegal weed still bad, imo.",
