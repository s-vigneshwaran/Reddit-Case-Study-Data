When I think of a charity, I think of an organization which exists only to take in donations and disburse them to the needy. That's the purpose. Not indoctrination, not having weekly services that have jack to do with helping people, not building lavish cathedrals, not aligning themselves with a fascist political party. \n\nIf churches want to be tax exempt, they can operate as apolitical charities. If not, they're not a charitable organization and not only is masquerading as one a violation of the ninth commandment but it should be illegal and subject not to taxation but being shut down permanently as they're guilty of fraud.",

The same thing happens with Eastern religions we just don't hear about the fringe groups from across the globe. We understand how Branch Davidians are connected to Christianity because we are familiar with the ideologies and bigger picture even though their theology was wildly different from mainstream Christians at the time (although the whole gun hoarding thing is started to get a little relevant). But compare that to the relationship between Rajneeshis and Buddhist, unless you're really familiar with this ideology they simply look like totally different religions but again, it's cut from the source of the larger religion.",

The Donatists, an early Christian sect, contained a fanatical group named the Circumcellions who would attack strangers on the street and attain supposed martyrdom.[8] Early Christianity established a ban on suicide, greatly reducing its occurrence.[9]\n\nIn the fifth century, Augustine wrote The City of God, in it making Christianity's first overall condemnation of suicide. His biblical justification for this was the interpretation of the commandment, \"Thou shalt not kill\", as he sees the omission of \"thy neighbor\", which is included in \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor\", to mean that the killing of oneself is not allowed either.[10] The rest of his reasons were from Plato's Phaedo.\n\nIn the sixth century AD, suicide became a secular crime and began to be viewed as sinful. In 1533, those who died by suicide while accused of a crime were denied a Christian burial. In 1562, all suicides were punished in this way. In 1693, even attempted suicide became an ecclesiastical crime, which could be punished by excommunication, with civil consequences following. In the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas denounced suicide as an act against God and as a sin for which one could not repent. Civil and criminal laws were enacted to discourage suicide, and as well as degrading the body rather than permitting a normal burial, property and possessions of the suicides and their families were confiscated.",

The Romans were wary of monotheistic religions such as the religion of the Jews, but respected it as it was old, and had a history. While Christianity was a part of judaism they didn\u2019t have a problem with it but once it started to become its own thing they were opposed\n\nThird, because the practice of the Eucharist was to never be seen by non-Christians Romans could only assume what they we occurring was cannibalism. They had no evidence of what the Eucharist was so they thought it was literally eating flesh and drinking blood.\n\nFourthly, most Roman persecution occurred after the emperor issued edicts in times of strife in the empire for a sacrifice to some of the Roman gods to offer protection and maintain the stability of the empire. I\u2019ve heard it compared to a pledge of allegiance, it doesn\u2019t have much to do with the your beliefs just demonstrates that you desire for the empire to be successful. Some Christians didn\u2019t see a problem with this one time, non-committal sacrifice and they did so without problem. They were not to be persecuted, it was the Christians who weren\u2019t willing to make these sacrifices who were to be persecuted\n\nBasically, to not make these sacrifices was to say to the empire that you didn\u2019t wish to see it prosper, which would come off as Christians wanting to subvert the state. \n\nJust as a final statement, Christian persecution was actually very rare, and tbh a lot of it was created by Christians and is basically the og persecution complex. There were some persecutions but for the most part they were not sought for persecution and desired to make the Romans seem as bad as possible.\n\ntl:dr, Romans weren\u2019t as bad as they were portrayed by Christians, and quite the contrary. Christians were the ones who were seen as bad people. And additionally, Christians were believed to be canibalistic",

I'm not trying to bash the Romans here, this is all apart of my view as to why the Romans looked at the Christians in the way they did. My point is that The Christians were counter to pretty much all of the major cultural facets of what it meant to be Roman, and that's one of the major reasons why the Romans were not friendly towards Christians.\n\nYou said that the romans weren't against human sacrifice, and then went off on some other stuff that I didn't necessarily disagree with, I was just trying to clarify what I meant with \"Human sacrifice\". They may not have been in favor of doing it religiously, but they had no problems watching someone die for the entertainment of a crowd or bloodthirsty emperor.",

Virtually all religious individuals are highly axiomatic and/or dogmatic thinkers, but religion is just an offshoot of axiomatic/dogmatic thinking. \n\nBut the thing is, we're built to do this.  Even \"I exist\" is an axiom.  I have to take that statement as true, and then I can build on top of it.  But if I really interrogate the statement, I can travel down a very unstable wormhole that makes doing or thinking anything very difficult. \n\nI believe there are a small subset of religious or spiritual individuals that an grasp axiomatic thinking and whom can see the axiom itself, and build on top of it, while being able to think *outside* the axiom. \n\nIn other words, you can be religious in the sense that you can \"switch\" into an axiomatic state of mind where you say \"God exists\", and build on top of it, while also understanding that to operate effectively in reality, to avoid tribalistic and narrow-minded thinking, you need to switch *away* from that axiom.\n\nIt's the basis of how we enjoy any story.  In order to enjoy *Ghost Busters*, I have to create an axiom \"this is real,\" and I can have emotions about it and be immersed in the experience.  But I can also put that axiom *away* when I need to, and switch back to reality.\n\nBut this is very hard to do, and typically most religion is spread via indoctrinators indoctrinating children when they're young and more susceptible to axioms, and thus they never grow out of that rigid dogmatic thought, to their great detriment.",

That\u2019s not to say there\u2019s no such thing as a stupid atheist or an atheist with magical thinking and cult like tendencies; you can be raised dogmatically atheist. Plenty of barbaric dictatorships have been nominally atheist although as Hitchens accurately points out, their mistake was not \u201ctoo much critical thinking\u201d but rather replacing one religion with another and propped up leaders and institutions with all the worship reverence and ritual of a religion. \n\nSo sure, atheists can be stupid sheep. It\u2019s just that the current crop of modern first world atheists you\u2019re liable to find in Internet forums on the topic have arrived at the position independently through some form of introspection/critical thinking rather than being indoctrinated into it by parents, community or government.  If left to their own devices the credulous will tend towards religion and the critical thinkers will tend away from it.",

Couldn't it happen in the future with what you are so sure about today?\"\n\nThis isn't valid only for the old vs new testament, it applies to everything that today is regarded as an \"interpretation\". Since those should be immutable truths, once considered true they should always be true, forever. The reality instead is that when a religion can't manipulate people anymore to believe in something, it evolves in order not to lose its power. So now, magically, they don't think the earth is at the center of the universe anymore, they don't think earth is only 4.000 years old, they acknowledge the existence of dinosaurs. Give it a while and they will say that they have always been tolerant of gays, and don't consider women as inferior, and maybe we will have a female pope someday. They've been drowning for centuries but still manage to gasp for air and stay afloat somehow.",

              "text": "I see religions as a kind of survival of the fittest, evolutionary perspective. \n\nSchizophrenia causes hallucinations and delusions. In the primitive ages of humanity, would those around a person who suffers from such conditions know that such things were just in the person's mind, or would they assume that they were in touch with a higher being? That they were touched by a god or a spirit or an angel? When you're just some random farmer who barely understands irrigation, you're not the most rational philosopher. A person says they are in contact with a god, and they're pretty normal otherwise, why would you believe otherwise? They have no reason to lie. You just have a person who sees and hears things you cannot, thus they must be special.\n\nThen, once religious beliefs is established and maintained over generations, the beliefs most suited to continued existence are more likely to survive. Religious beliefs are in competition with one another. If one priest tells you nothing bad will happen if you don't worship their god, and another says their god will punish you if you don't worship his god, you're more motivated to believe the latter. Better to err on the side of caution.\n\nThis, we get religious beliefs that seem to promote scientific ignorance, unquestioning obedience and fear for god that survive to the modern day. It's not that someone deliberately designed such stories with the intent to make more people believe, to control and have power over them. It's that beliefs/teachings happen to be created by chance and those that improve it's ability to propagate were more likely to survive and continue. Interpretations or further \"revelations\" are like mutations, and those that make a religion more convincing become more likely to be adopted en masse, making the religion more effective as self-perpetuation.",

It happens a lot because that approach, at least so far, produces favorable outcomes since opposing politicians have a more difficult time justifying the denial of child protections.  It's just a tool.\n\n\nI think the GOP recognized that if they used Christianity in the same manner they can similarly maintain support for their own agendas only with an extra benefit: you cannot logically reason a religious zealot out of religion. \n\n\nWhat they did not realize is that when they started to over-use that tool they have encouraged the most crazy to push their way to the front of the herd. \n\n\nI have no data to support this, just a random thought from my corner of the world.",

They use this as justification for some of the policies they support that can be shown to directly harm children, Like endeavoring to ban the use of any technology that may or may not, directly or indirectly, have utilized stem cells, thus leading to new outbreaks of what the previous generation considered an \"Eradicated disease.\" They claim it's all part of a greater conviction that \"all life is sacred.\"\n\nThe other group? Well, they don't make such grandiose and nebulous claims to try and justify their beliefs on important issues that rightfully require a great deal of complexity and nuance in our consideration. And because of this, within this second group it's often pretty rare to find high degrees of consensus on any one issue... Although, they certainly seemed pretty upset when Roe was overturned.\n\nYa feelin' me, homeslice? of course you are. cuz you're not fucking  insane.",

Not their relationship with God.\n\nI left the church and my bond with Christ has never been stronger and I\u2019m immune to Christian propaganda. \n\nI also find myself having amazing conversations with non-Christians, where a lot of Christians won\u2019t associate with others. \n\nReligion is man made.

I mean, most of the greatest civil rights heroes and abolitionists called themselves Christian.  Just because we know the beliefs are bullshit doesn't mean there aren't some very good people in that group.\n\nIt is important to keep your eye on the ball and recognize that things have been getting progressively worse in American Christianity.  Those with the most funding and loudest voices are brazenly repeating the mistakes which led to WWII.  Painting everyone who goes to any kind of Christian church (there are over a thousand denominations who vary wildly) with a broad brush and claiming they're all the same is shooting yourself in the foot.  There are particular people who are pushing the largest groups of those under this label to behave in far worse ways than in the somewhat recent past, and that's an issue separate from our criticisms of their embrace of woo (which the vast majority of humanity does in some form).\n\nEdit:  Downvoted within less than 5 minutes.  This is part of the reason a lot of atheists hate this sub.  Maybe try explaining what's wrong with what I said?",

If conservative Christians would just stop being political then this wouldn\u2019t happen, and then people would only moderately believe in Christianity, but because they have to get so political about non-political things like the existence of gay people and trans people that now they make it to wear people don\u2019t want to go to church because it\u2019s so disgusting with how racist and homophobic people are in the church. People who just believed in this idea of being good to each other don\u2019t really care about Christian fundamentalism, not to mention many Christian fundamentalist don\u2019t even fucking read the Bible themselves as many of them wear a mix of two fabrics while condemning gay people, without realizing that if the Christian hell exist they\u2019re going to a too because there\u2019s more fucking sin that they committed then the people who don\u2019t even believe in Christianity themselves.",

The pastor admitted that he's reluctant to preach against everyday sins; sex outside of marriage, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, divorce etc, he said that most churches that want to stay in business must preach against things that the majority of parishioners are not guilty of.  The pastor claimed that the church is in a sense a business, its necessary to keep church goers happy so they will continue donating (yes, it primarily about money and of course allowing the preacher to push his own personal views and ideas on the congregation).  Ultimately after much research on religion, I decided that I can be a spiritual personal by walking my own path, I certainly don't need to join a church to tell me what my inner self has already told me.  Nonetheless most of the members of church were really judgemental hypocrites and its very sad to see so many insecure humans that feel like they have to be part of any particular group(s).  The higher power created each and everyone of us and ultimately the higher power guides everyone of us along your unique paths (each person walks their own path as each soul has unique lessons to learn for its own spiritual development).  \"There are many paths to the light, you walk yours and I'll walk mine, we'll meet at the end.\" \u2764\ufe0f",

Personally speaking, it took me a few years to become a Atheistic Humanist person, I'm 28 soon, but I became Agnostic briefly throughout my teens & I've been an Atheistic Humanist for a few years now. I will never ever go back to believing in something that makes no sense at all and I will continue to stick with science to learn/enhance my visions and knowledge about the world. Life is well spent when you constantly pick up new and more knowledge about our world/its inhabitants.\n\nHowever I am interested in mythology and stuff to do with old European religions (Paganism and stuff) because it's part of being appreciative of my ancestors who built the European lands I live in and call home. However they're ONLY mythology and HAVEN'T GOT any hardcore evidence stacked up against them, just like all the Abrahamic religions haven't (apart from a bit of literature in the form of a holy book). If anything, I'm a cultural appreciator and believe that religions helped shape the world into what it is nowadays with laws and regulations to stop people being harmed/killed (religion used to be the way societies were run before democracy, dictatorship and a few other things became a thing, but it's also been about control and power, too.). Religion will inevitably die mostly throughout the developed world and rapidly developing world, but some of the cultural stuff will be kept such as Easter, Christmas, etc. Because these are just times to spend with loved ones and friends, etc.",

Makes all atheist look alike ignorant douchebags!  I'm amazed with all this Christian/not Christian talk. Who cares? Do atheist or Christians know right or wrong? Do they always do the right thing based on your beliefs? Why is something considered right/correct vs. wrong/incorrect? It really doesn't matter. Civilized countries require rules. Back way back in the days, it was okay to wipe out an entire country. That was the way of the living. Conquer or be conquered.  Wrongs of today was the right ways in the past. It really comes down to popular beliefs and follower's. Just like religion. Atheist is just that. New thing that is trending. Just like LGBTQ, BLM, ANtifa, etc. Who cares!",

The Ebers Papyrus from 1550 BC and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850 BC have within them some of the earliest documented descriptions of birth control, the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm.[5][6] Another early document explicitly referring to birth control methods is the Kahun Gynecological Papyrus from about 1850 BC. It describes various contraceptive pessaries, including acacia gum, which recent research has confirmed to have spermatocidal qualities and is still used in contraceptive jellies. Other birth control methods mentioned in the papyrus include the application of gummy substances to cover the \"mouth of the womb\" (i.e. the cervix), a mixture of honey and sodium carbonate applied to the inside of the vagina, and a pessary made from crocodile dung. Lactation (breast-feeding) of up to three years was also used for birth control purposes in ancient Egypt\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_birth_control#Ancient_Egypt\n\nAlso\n\nhttps://www.ranker.com/list/female-egyptian-mummies-changed-to-male/rachel-souerbry",

I went out or my way to answer your question, if your goal is to argue semantics then you can kick rocks.\n\nThe way everyone who cares about portraying their views coherently and usefully use these definitions is easy.\n\n(a)themism answers the question \"do you believe in god?\"\n\n(a)gnosticism answers the question \"do you know that god exists?\"",
