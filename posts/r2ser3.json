Yet downplayed compared to the big bad trump coup.\nThose \u201ccriminals\u201d in the coup just marched right on in with smiles on there faces, meanwhile peaceful protesters push burning cars through streets and smash small business windows.\nHonestly the duplicity in that country is just mind blowing. It\u2019s so boring. You vote for the same people every few years. Literally. It\u2019s all the same. Yet they feel free to vote for the right choice . They lap it up and love the circus, which now is so boring",

But it's not usually worth it, if there's no likely harm from it, and claims by obviously ludicrous people are often not taken seriously by courts. (Witness, for example, a recent defamation suit against Tucker Carlson, which was dismissed on the argument that no intelligent people take Carlson seriously, so statements he makes can't rise to defamation, because defamatory statements have to at least be believable to reasonable people.)\n\nIn this case, this person is so obviously ludicrous that probably nothing she says is actionable, because nothing she says is credible.",

Essentially, he created a valuing system for historical events (which fairly arbitrarily assigned values to things like whether a ruler was poisoned or whether a war lasted longer than a year), crunched the numbers, got a value that \"described\" the event, and the compared that to other events with similar values and decided that they *were the same events,* and contorted his chronology to account for it. Thus you get claims such as; the Peloponnesian War was between the Duchy of Athens and the Duchy of Neopatras in the 14th century. It is all obvious bullshit.",

How is a decision made in Iran evidence of an anti-Classics movement in Occidental countries?\n\nThe third link, which leads to an article titled: \"Whitewashing Ancient Statues: Whiteness, Racism And Color In The Ancient World\" is mainly about how ancient Roman statues were originally painted, not white marble. If anything, the article actually spends a bit of time discussing how modern concepts of race based on skin tone didn't apply in Ancient Rome, and the assumption that everyone was white was added later.  Aka, ancient Romans didn't discriminate based on what we now consider race (just by other criteria). D\nid you read this article before linking it? If you did, why did you think \"Whiteness and Racism in the Ancient World\" was an appropriate summary/title?\n\nYour choice of words in \"de-stigmatize\" and \"purify\" is also interesting, as I can't find either word used in anything you've linked here-- including in the articles that seem to be mocking the idea that racism is a problem.",

It was commissioned by Trajan around 100-110AD and inaugurated in 113AD; during the Middle Ages it was repurposed, like many Roman ruins. They added extra floors and a militia tower, and eventually a convent was built on the site in the 16th century. In the 1930s the convent was demolished by Mussolini and the ruin partially restored with new brick. \n\nThe Tiktok lady in the above video has elsewhere stated that she belives the 1930s restoration is evidence that the ruin was falsified, and that Mussolini built the thing out of whole cloth after demolishing the convent and other nearby buildings. This is silly because we have tons of evidence that the ruins existed before Mussolini; her counterargument to that is that Mussolini was a fascist and if you disagree with her you are also a fascist. She is not a very pleasant debating partner.",

They make tens, sometimes hundreds of false claims, it's no use playing whack-a-mole with them.

Either through reasoning, experience, or revelation.\n* Knowledge that can obtained exclusively by revelation is unreproducible and untestable. If revealed knowledge is testable, it can be obtained by experience and therefor tested.\n* Knowledge obtained by reasoning has to follow the principle of contradiction. Reasoning that doesn't follow the principle of contradiction allows for every claim to be \"true\", which does not appear to be the case to put it lightly.\n* Rigorous (well-defined, well-reasoned) knowledge from reasoning that follows the principle of contradiction is represented by math.\n* Rigorous experience is represented by the scientific method or other reliable forms of documentation.\n\nIf their claims cannot be tested through experience (the scientific method, empiricism) or math, then all they have is revelation and \"it's true because I/God/someone says it is.\"\n\nInstead of going claim-by-claim just ask that person \"What's your methodology? How are your observations verified/falsified?\" etc.",

His sister won a grant from the Italian government to study Latin in Italy (she ended up teaching Latin at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland until she passed away at age 33 from cancer). My dad went with his big sister for company and fun. \n\nHe helped with various tasks at the site - he was already working in construction at the time and knew his way around building scaffolding. \n\nThey did not have much money, so they lived on pasta for the summer - the cheapest meal around. \n\nMy dad often talked about this summer - and thankfully it impressed my mom - the geology nutcase - enough to get them talking before they started dating. They were together for nearly 55 years before he passed away in May 2020.",

She insists there are \"zero primary documents\" from the Roman era, which I'm pretty sure is false based on a cursory google search.   \n\n\nShe also has some interesting biblical re-interpretations(Adam was a God), and historical speculation(Alexander the Great was a woman).",

Anyone who disagrees with her is a racist, misogynistic, antisemitic, brainwashed idiot who is soo predictable and boring like you wouldn't believe. She's the kind of person who would very much benefit from the world being civilized (in order to fuel her passive-aggressiveness in a patronizing way), because if she were where I am from, she'd be smacked in the face like yesterday (not that I'm condoning violence, but some people are unsufferable assholes).",

And her have a different view that is so incredibly wrong is wrong and she is so rude and such an asshole to anyone who has a different opinion. She tears at your character if you try to say any different.\n\nHer thinking could actually hurt a lot of people...like idk all of Italy or people who have dedicated their entire career to it. Trying to change a historical event that is proven to fit your insane narrative it much more of an asshole move than the guy who debunked her. \nWhy are you seeing his video as him being condescending?",
