And they have all kinds of fucked up and nefarious ways of explaining why women won't call themselves Feminists, or worse, even actively oppose it.\n\nThey'll accuse them of internalized misogyny, they'll call them \"pick mes\", slaves to the patriarchy, or worse. It's honestly unbelievable.\n\nBut the sad part is that Feminists don't even agree with *one another* about the best way to create their Feminist utopia. There's a massive divide between Radical Feminists and Liberal Feminists on everything from prostitution, porn, trans rights, the sexualization of women, and too many other topics to list. They can't even decide if self-objectification is empowering or degrading to women,  whether trans women are actual women, or men in drag. It's fucking crazy.",
