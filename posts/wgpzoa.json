But just any old dead person sounds insignificant.  Who's afraid of a random skull?\n\nDeath, as a personified character, is much more widely known as a specter and a symbol of our mortality.\n\nWhich sounds scarier or more symbolic to you?\n\nA) The head of some dead guy\n\nB) Death's Head\n\nSo I think the cool factor honestly plays a role here.  Even in German they elaborated the scariness by using a more detailed description rather than just calling it der Sch\u00e4del.",

It\u2019s also 100% natural, biodegradable and simply beautiful.\nSo, around the globe it is completely normal for people to celebrate this beauty by displaying skulls at their walls.\n\nEven if the skull would look perfectly the same as the official trademark of the \u201cTotenkopfverb\u00e4nde\u201d, the part of nazi Waffen-SS which ran the nazi concentration camps, infamous for killing millions of civilians, mostly women and children in their gas chambers. While healthy male civilians were purposely saved from the gas chambers, just to let them starve to death while being forced to slave labor.\n\nSo here you have it:\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc The svastika is a Buddhist sign.*\n\n\ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc A skull is so beautiful, people put it on flags on their wall, even if they\u2019re forced to use a nazi-flag**\n\nSo I\u2019m 100% sure your teacher is not a Nazi.\n\n*(Even though it\u2019s often pictured being held in the claws of the official nazi-eagle trademark. Come on, coincidences happen!)\n\n**(Even though they have to use a flag displaying the official nazi-skull trademark. Come on, it could\u2019ve been the last skull-themed flag they had in the local store? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f)\n\n(/s)",

The north was basically defending itself.  \n\nA large reason the civil rights movement was an issue in the south was because the US government just allowed the civil war to end without any punishments or reparations, with winks and nods that allowed the south to keep oppressing black people \u2013 slaves had to be \u2018freed\u2019, but they were allowed plenty of loopholes to keep the spirit of slavery.

Places like New York, Chicago, Boston, etc were bringing lots of money to their regions with industrial progress, but the south\u2019s revenue still relied primarily on agriculture \u2013 which was heavily dependent on the free labour provided by slaves.  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t crippling for northern states to say hey, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be treating black people this way, because manufacturing and other newer industries weren\u2019t relying on that. But in the south, taking away their slave labour would mean radical changes and possible bankruptcy.  \n\nThat\u2019s why legacy southerners still say their family was fighting for their way of life. They literally were \u2013 slavery was the backbone underpinning their industry. Honestly, some places never recovered their industry and are still wastelands today.",

It was more that agriculture was more deeply entrenched in southern vs northern states as their main industry \u2013 its easier to grow crops and keep cows in warmer climates, especially before electricity was a thing.  \n\nYou\u2019re right, it\u2019s horrible that we ever treated people that way, and we\u2019re still not really over it.

                          "text": "Early war ambitions for the Union were more geared towards maintaining the Union itself (although you cannot discount the numerous abolitionists and the pull of Radical Republicans). However, many Union soldiers did fight explicitly for abolition. By the time that slaves in Union possession were declared contraband, the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, and the Union reestablished a southern government in Louisiana (not immediately after it was retaken), the narrative and the motives just across the board had begun to shift (early proposals in Louisiana attempted to implement universal suffrage, which was overruled by Lincoln directly). By the wars end, I think it\u2019s fair to say that a major aim of the Union was to end the so-called \u201cpeculiar institution.\u201d Hence why we have our 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments. \n\nContrarily, the South, from day one, was focused solely on maintaining and expanding slavery as they had been for the previous like 30 years. This included several near constitutional crises (like the only good thing Andrew Jackson did was perhaps push the war back a few decades). The Mexican-American war nearly broke the states as the States almost claimed far more of Mexico than it actually desired; the South launched several attempts to claim and colonize Cuba as a slave state (expanding slavery westward and southward were main goals of the south); and we had the Compromise of 1850.\n\nEdit: my take on Lincoln is that his primary goal was crushing the confederacy to bring them back to the fold before he quickly became focused on ending slavery as a means to defeat the South. But even more quickly, I think his ultimate goal shifted to just outright ending slavery entirely. Lots of people criticized Lincoln (including Frederick Douglas) for hedging at times. But I honestly think the nucleus was set by like 1863 and then you just see his policies piecemeal marshaling towards just gutting slavery entirely. One of our biggest tragedies as a nation is that we didn\u2019t get a full second term of Lincoln.",

The union didn't go to war to protect the rights of the slaves. Plain and simple, they went to war to prevent the confederacy from seceding to keep the country unified.\n\n>I just don\u2019t believe that they would do so to help black people\n\nThey didn't. Once again, the right to own slaves was the primary reason the South wanted to secede, and the North went to war to prevent the secession. It wasn't about slaves or slave rights for the North; it was about stopping a challenge to the authority of the federal government.",

So it depends if the grandpa of your coworker was actually awarded the iron cross and if your coworker knows what it stands for. But combined with the 88 i lean towards nazi cause who tatoos their birth year, especially in association with a large iron cross? He was either absolutely oblivious to the association, or it was intentional, otherwise no one would do that.",

One of the first things the Nazis did after seizing power, was getting rid of the black-red-gold flag of the Weimar Republic (and the democratic revolution of 1848). Todays Germany is using black-red-gold again because it is a symbol of democracy.\n\nBut all the other Nazis flags and symbols are proof that this teacher in fact is not only a Nazi, but also an idiot who has no knowledge of the history and meaning  of at least one of the flags she(?) is displaying. Nazi and being an ignorant idiot is a pretty common combination.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:** To be clear. I don't blame anyone, especially people who are not from Germany, to not know the history of black-red-gold.

The Scandinavian version can be found here and there in old viking carvings.  I believe Hitler actually derived the swastika from that symbol, which was supposed to [depict the hammer of Thor in flight](https://norse-mythology.org/symbols/swastika-ancient-origins-modern-misuse/).  Being as how Thor is/was the protector of the world against the forces of chaos it was a very positive symbol, however it had fallen out of use by the 1930s.  Hitler brushed it off as part of his \"Aryan\" narrative.  And it will never be a positive symbol again.  \n\nThe Hindu version of the symbol probably has no connection to the northern European one.  Maybe in pre-history, but how hard is it to come up with a modified cross?  There's a version [among American First Peoples](https://www.warpaths2peacepipes.com/native-american-symbols/swastika-symbol.htm) also.  \n\nHonestly, it's a bit like the pentacle star.  The five pointed star has been up and down the occult ledgers so many times in can stand for bloody anything by now.  The world is full of modified crosses, each one meant something at the time.",

They use talking points like , \" actually, anti racism really means anti white\".   They think a white genocide is coming to America \"the day of the rope\"(d.o.t.rope is taken from a fiction novel by neo Nazi leader William Pierce under the pseudonym \u201cAndrew Macdonald\u201d).  One of Timothy McVeigh's favorite books too. \n\n\"In the novel, white supremacist rebels, having taken control of California, engage in mass lynchings of purported \u201crace traitors\u201d such as journalists, politicians, and women in relationships with non-white men. These murders, which take place on the same day, are referred to in the novel as the \u201cDay of the Rope.\u201d\n\nBy the 1990s, the \u201cDay of the Rope\u201d had become a concept well-known across the white supremacist movement, even to the extent that a white supremacist business selling white power music CDs and racist paraphernalia named itself \u201cDay of the Rope Productions.\u201d  A 1994 song from white power band Bound for Glory contained the lyrics, \u201cPoliticians to Pope, there\u2019ll be no hope/There is no escaping the Day of the Rope.\u201d  During the early 2000s, the term was borrowed for a series of white supremacist music compilations from Eastern Europe.\n\nWithin a few years, \u201cDay of the Rope\u201d became a popular white supremacist slogan on social media websites, as did the phrase \u201cThere is no escaping the Day of the Rope,\u201d the latter even appearing on a white supremacist flyer created by the neo-Nazi group Atomwaffen. Another variation is \u201cThe Day of the Rope is coming.\u201d\n\nTaken from https://www.adl.org/resources/hate-symbol/day-rope\n\nWe saw that \"rope\" on Jan 6th too.

It was either used as a symbol of mourning the dead, as a symbol of defiance against death, or as a warning that they were bringing death with them. It wasn't until it became commonly used by the Freikorps (the German militia forces that formed in response to demilitarization under the Versailles Treaty) that it became associated with far-right wing aithoritarians. Many of the Freikorps were already or would become radicalized to become the Nazi Brown Shirts with the party's rise.\n\n Most of the guys honoring Prussian and German Imperialist culture are usually cool with the Nazis as well so it makes sense to solely view it as a symbol of the German far-right regardless of how it is being used.",

The country is a non arian but Nazi country, and now all the rights comment section say they fought the wrong enemy so much they hate communism, why really? Because it gave opportunity to other type of people, and they hate that so much, all they do is think racially about everything all the time, the nukes on Japan didn't make them bat an eye. Yet no one Nuremberged the US. They now talk about Russia war crimes \ud83e\udd26\ud83e\udd26, like nuking two who cities of an overpopulated island is ok or was ok, Vietnam was also a war crime but no one addresses it because all the time they think racially, since the effers started the shit show vile country\n\nEdit : I wanna add, the \"3rd world\" countries they dislike are just countries that are genetically different from them, they don't think about the poor Balkan countries or poor countries with a population that looks like them because they think about it racially",

The stars and bars is a blue square in the left corner with a circle of stars in it and filling out the rest of the flag are red and white stripes [seen here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c8/Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_%281861%E2%80%931863%29.svg/1920px-Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_%281861%E2%80%931863%29.svg.png). The confederacy actually used a lot of flags, my personal favorite from an aesthetic standpoint being the [Bonny Blue Flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_Blue_flag#/media/File:Bonnie_Blue_flag.svg) which was actually incorporated into the flag of the state of Texas. Also notable is the Blood-Stained Banner which [looked like this.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#/media/File:Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_(1865,_variant).svg) but what is typically seen as the confederate flag [that we're all familiar with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#/media/File:Confederate_Rebel_Flag.svg), that all the rednecks hang in their trailers is really just one battle flag. The actual national flag of the CSA was a white flag with that design in the upper right corner [as seen here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America#/media/File:Flag_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America_(1863%E2%80%931865).svg)\n\nThey all represent the same evil though.",

I liked it better when we just accepted someone was a nazi when they told us so.",

So that's why people need to be careful.\n\nTough I actually endorse the use of Nazi symbols.\nNobody suspected Ted Bundy would commit mass murder, but a guy with a swastika is like a warning sign \"dumbfuck likely to commit hatecrimes\"\n\nJust like Aldo the Apache, I like to recognize Nazi's.

To be honest, given a 2D plane, one could draw Swastika in any orientation/angle and it'll still remain Swastika. If you look at a Swastika drawn on a paper from either sides and consider that whichever side you are looking at is the correct way/orientation to draw that symbol, you'd technically still be right since it's still a Swastika, no matter how you look at it!\n\nBut to differentitate it from the original, one could do simple changes like tilt it or remove the dots, similar to Nazi's symbol hence, calling it Nazi Swastika.",

On its side not tilted like how nazis used it. \n\nShortly told that symbol came from the Swedish Count Eric Von Rosen who had painted it to the side of the plane he gifted to \"whites\" (Nationalists) who fought against Soviet reds in Finnish civil war. Which broke out after Finnish declare of the independence 6th of December 1917. This plane Von Rosen gifted (Thulin Typ D) was the second or first (if broken down plane is not counted) aircraft for the Finnish Air Force. \n\nBlue swastika was ancient symbol of sun and of good luck, white backround originated when Finns painted white paint over advertisements of Thulin Air Academy. Thus symbol of Finnish Air Force was born. \n\nCount Eric Von Rosen was there in Vaasa (Capital of whites, during civil war) when he gave the plane to whites 6th of March 1918 making Finnish Air Force one of the oldest air forces in the world.",

It has been around since the late neolithic period.  \n\nIt isn't just confined to Asia, the Romans, for example (multiple Indigenous American groups, Persians,  and the precursors to the Swahili people all also developed it independently as far as we can tell). It tends to have about the same meaning wherever it pops up.\n\n Nazis used known and iconic symbols. That was purposeful on the one hand - they were trying to create a culture attached to its own built world that masqueraded as tradition and history.  \n\nBut,  on the other hand,  it's also because iconic symbols always have been and always will be useful at creating a short hand between complex ideology and cultural dissemination/ integration - for good or ill.   \n\nThey used the eagle,  too, just as the Romans did,  just as Americans do, to again stand in for roughly the same ideas. \n\nI would teach this to my students so they could start seeing patterns that would make it easier for them to create useful research questions. An eagle might not mean the same thing in every culture (an expansionist,  militarized government), but if you know it often does, it's a place to start.",

They are required to have served a minimum of 48 months with an honorable or medical discharge.\n\nI've had veterans as teachers myself in the past.

We\u2019ve all come across people that are absolutely devoid of humor and subtlety, that they 100% mean everything they post, they're not trolling, they're not playing dumb, they are incapable of saying anything that isn't literal. That's how I saw the post. Initially you'd 100% think they knew that it was obviously a nazi flag and that they\u2019re just shitposting. But the more time I spend online, especially Reddit or Twitter, like the above, I  have grown to see everyone who posts this sort of stuff as genuine. They\u2019re much more likely to be one of those hyper-literalists, incapable of shitposting, on the spectrum types.

I have not the slightest idea why people honestly believe that a christian like Hitler would go to a different religion, pirate one of their symbols and use it as a centerpiece for his propaganda.

The oldest artifact depicting a swastika was found in modern day Ukraine. \n\nHitler's choice of the swastika was based on the fact that he wanted to revive some of the old Germanic symbols and one of the ones he chose was the swastika. Buddhism has absolutely fuck all to do with it and I'm tired of hearing about it. Our history is weird and fucked up enough as it is, you don't have to make shit up.",

The fact that it was found in archaeological digs across all Indo-European peoples (including Hindus) was seen as proof that a great \u201cAryan\u201d empire had once stretched from Western Europe to India and Persia. Some Nazi ethnologists also believed that because it was found in Peru and the American South West that ancient \u201cAryans\u201d had travelled to the Americas. The German preoccupation with the sun wheels really took off with Schliemann\u2019s discovery of Troy and the finding of tens of thousands of sun wheels.\n\nSo it\u2019s not derived from the Hindu/Buddhist symbol, it has the same ancestor however as the Indian sun wheel. And it\u2019s connection the the Indian symbol was played up as proof that there was once an \u201cAryan\u201d empire.",

      "text": "The Swastika (cw points/ccw rotation) and the Sauwastika (ccw points/cw rotation) are symbols used in Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism. They are very common sights in India, out of which all these religions come. The key difference with the Nazi Swastika bastardization: the Nazis rotated a Swastika by 45\u00b0. The symbol at large has had many meanings throughout all Eurasian cultures, and though it varies in its importance, has generally been seen to be at least a good luck charm.\n\nWhat's more interesting about how it was used in the 20th century was how Hitler, Nazis, et al used a theory developed by linguistic scholars to purport that the German peoples were the true descendants of the Arian (Ah-rye-ann) people from the Indus Valley, who were know by archeology to have vanished from the valley a long time before. Arian roughly means \"honored people\" in Sanskrit. Those linguistic scholars had found trace similarities in the languages spanning from India back through the Middle East over to Europe over time, and devised a theory that Sanskrit and other more ancient ancestors to languages like Greek, Latin, and Farsi were connected somehow by a [Proto-Indo-European (Wikipedia link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Europeans?wprov=sfla1) language spoken by many different subsets of people's whose particular languages broke off, just like French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Italian all derived from Latin. The theorists specifically stated that there was no racial/ethnic based claim to be made for these as this common language group would have been spoken by many different Neolithic peoples for which we have no great account, but that didn't stop Nazi assholes, who took it as a theory of Proto-Indo-GERMANIC language, from putting a whole bunch of dots together the wrong way to give a rising populist movement its grandstanding horseshit cornerstone of justification for racial/genetic superiority and ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe Proto-Indo-European linguistic theory is pretty good and makes a lot of sense, kind of like the Indian Swastika symbols. Like many other things, the political turmoil of 1930's Germany distorted all of it.",

The swastika is also a Sanskrit word, which is the holy language of the vedic people and their defendants (now called the Hindus). \n\nBuddhism was an anti movement against the (by then aging) Vedic religion. It reestablish the siddha religion (like tantra and yoga) which lived side by side with the Vedic religion but took a back seat in the later stages of the vedic age (as priest starter to keep the people dumb to preserve their power). \n\nBuddhist didn't use Sanskrit since Sanskrit was only reserved for the learned back then (in order to keep the \"sacred knowledge\" away from the unworthy, and later to keep it away from the public and keep them dumb/enslaved to the priest classe). The Buddha was firmly (and rightfully) against the varnas or class system, and so rejected all components of it, including using Sanskrit as the language for their scripture.\n\nThat said, the Buddhist as the Jains, as other religions from India use the swastika symbol as a symbol for prosperity (and as the symbol for the sun or the four wind directions).",

It was originally supposed to be in World at War but it was cut due to time constraints. Thankfully, Treyarch was able to finish it up, polish it up, and release it with Black Ops, cause it was good. Really good. So many iconic weapons. Layout was a perfect blend of simple and complex and the enemies were all unique and fun to fight. Plus, Kino had some of the best music in any COD Zombies map ever which made it even more addicting to play through and grind over and over. Call me old school, but I think Kino is the absolute best zombies map ever released and I could play it a million times without ever getting bored. There you have it my friends a trip to 50 to 1. I know were not gonna all agree, let me know what you think, ill see you soon. \n(*Puzzle - RetroVision Playing*)",

Once the swastika is rotated 45 degrees, it's no longer a Buddhist or peaceful symbol representing anything religious and is now a Nazi symbol representing racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism among other things. Similar to how displaying the confederate flag no longer represents the pride of southern states and the confederacy. It now represents nothing but racism and slavery. Anyone trying to argue differently is simply a racist using the flags original purpose to hide their racism.   \n\nOn top of all of that, she's straight up displaying a Nazi flag that has the imperial eagle and iron cross all on the same flag together right next to what looks like an SS flag and the German flag, so even if what the person is saying is indeed true, what this racist bitch is doing has nothing to do with religion. \n\nDisplaying those three flags together isn't a fucking coincidence and if this really is a teacher, I hope someone took a screen shot of this and forwarded it to the school administrators.  This person should not be teaching anyone anything although they could probably benefit from a few history classes themselves or perhaps a class on not being a racist  P.O.S. \n\nTL/DR: Hanging a Nazi flag with a swastika rotated 45 degrees that also has the imperial eagle and the iron cross on it in addition to an SS flag and the German flag has nothing to do with religion or Buddhism symbolism. Its called racism and anti-Semitism.",

That's not fit for a history class, because none of that is history, but happening right now.\n\nIf it's to talk about white supremacist movements, then why the Germany flag when they've done everything they can to stamp out any Nazi symbolism? Why even have the flag at all when you could, I don't know, just talk about it instead of having to remind people what modern Germany's flag is?\n\nFinally, if it's just some random adult having those flags behind them on the wall, then they're definitely a Nazi. Besides which, there's no reason to put them up when you can just share them in the call itself and not put it up on the wall behind you where they aren't even all in frame.\n\nYou can go ahead and give me a context where it makes sense, but you'll only come up with an easily disproven one.",
