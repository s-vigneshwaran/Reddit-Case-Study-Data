      "text": "A couple of months ago an Air Force chaplain did an AMA on /r/airforce.  They explained the religious exemption process from submission to approval because you have to go through their office to ask for one.  In that thread they stated that they fully expected none to be approved because there wasn't a medical or legal reason to oppose them.  It would also be really hard for someone in the military to show why a COVID vaccine is against their religion but all others are fine.  I'm glad to see they were right.\n\nEdit: [Here's the link to the AMA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/paduwg/chaplain_here_ask_your_questions_about_religious/)",

I said, I'll take it.

Since the FDA included a provision in the Approval Letter for Pfizer that the long term testing won't be completed until June, 2025, then they may not feel comfortable about that. Long term testing has been completed on all other required vaccines. \n\nWhen you combine that with [all of the EU countries who just recently decided to stop giving Moderna vaccines](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/11/10/germany-france-restrict-modernas-covid-vaccine-for-under-30s-over-rare-heart-risk-despite-surging-cases/?sh=10d408f22a8a) to males under 30 (prime military age), then you can certainly make the case that not enough long term testing has been completed.",

If you believe covid is caused by 5G, you interpret this as permission to not get vaccinated. \n\nWhy look at the science when the church can tell you what you want to hear?",

You can be exempt from having to take the thing; you can't be exempt from taking responsibility for the fact there's a pandemic still ongoing.\n\n(I'll explain why if anyone is genuinely curious in a PM; I won't explain here because my religion does not require proselytization and I have no intention of spreading an anti-vax agenda.) \n\nAll these people who want to get \"exceptions\" and then go on about their lives like nothing has changed are hypocritical as fuck. You don't get to have it both ways. Either you take the vaccine, and then you can go back to things being mostly normal... or you can not take the vaccine, in which case YOU STILL NEED TO QUARANTINE, SOCIAL DISTANCE, WEAR A MASK, etc. etc.\n\nAnd if you have a job that forces you to be around other people, you need to quit. And if you are in the military and can't be granted an exemption *and* can't quit... then you go to military prison for dereliction of duty, and highly likely solitary confinement due to the danger of a pandemic... and that's a choice you're allowed to make. (And if your reason is ACTUALLY religious and not political then that's a sacrifice you should be willing to make.) You may be legally exempt from the vaccine... but you are not exempt, NO ONE is exempt, from the pandemic itself, and if you reject one prevention measure for religious reasons, you need to **double down** on all others, not reject the entire concept of prevention.\n\nI wish people would realize that \"you have religious freedom and cannot be forced to engage in an action that is against your beliefs\" and \"you are allowed to freely infect whoever you want and disregard pandemic prevention measures entirely\" are not the same statement.\n\nAs someone with the most basic modicum of responsibility I am still quarantining to the best of my ability and intend to continue doing so until this is all over. Anyone failing to do so is not asking for a religious exemption to the vaccine - they're asking to be allowed to have no personal responsibility for anything they do, and telling the rest of the world to suck it.\n\nI know this will likely be downvoted... and I understand why... but I really wish it wouldn't, not for karma reasons but because I really think this is something a lot of anti-vax people need to hear. Their hypocrisy is getting people killed, and while everyone is constantly calling out their refusal to vaccinate... in lieu of any chance of them changing their minds about that, I think we should be calling out their hypocrisy in ALSO refusing the pandemic prevention measures that might end this and keep them from having to take it in the first place.",

Meaning you shouldn't draw a figure on a flag, and moreover an actual US flag, like a physical flag that exists in 3d, not a dang tattoo.  \n\nOnce again, a tattoo is not \"against\" the Flag Code no matter how much you want to stretch the meaning.",

And I brought up the whole \u201ckilling is wrong thing\u201d , hurting innocents is wrong, and possibly/probably invading another country for war is wrong.

The military can, in fact, force you to take a vaccine.  You give your consent when you VOLUNTARILY enlist or are commissioned as an officer! I had to go through a round in bootcamp like EVERY OTHER RECRUIT!  Then a second round for my over-seas screening.  Why is something that the military has been doing for literally DECADES or longer now such a hot fucking issue?\n\nI had to explain to this jackass that refusing orders is insubordination that is punishable under the UCMJ.  That he'd KNOW THAT if he actually served\n\nWhat I really don't understand is that these right-wing, military bootlicking, cum-stains can't suck off the troops hard enough.  Praising them for their sacrifice.  They go on-n-on about how much they allegedly give for our freedoms.  Hell, many of these right-wing vets wear shirts and share cringy posts about how \"veteran\" is a \"blank check a service member writes to the USA that is payable up to and including their life\".  So if they're OK w/ service members dying, then why the FUCK isn't this seen in the same light?  Just another \"sacrifice\" on part of the service member.  \n\nI wish they'd stop whining about the shot and just share another useless post reminding people to suck off the next service member while thanking them for their service instead.",

Then the Cheeto in charge basically said \"lol fuck those people rite guys!\" and refused to do anything because it helps democrats. So when it started spreading to everybody (as predicted by every not moron) he could never admit he was wrong, he just doubled down on claiming it wasn't a big deal. Now combine that shit with the already festering general anti-vax movement...\n\nThat is the TLDR of how fighting covid got turned political.",

We only got it because we were deploying to Iraq and Afghanistan, where I guess there is a chance we could get it or at least a bit enough chance that the military thought catching it would be hard on force readiness capabilities because it could spread very quickly if one of us got it overseas and just decided that was enough to make sure we all received that vaccine.

Many viewed military service as a means to protect the friends, families, and communities. Only later did they learn that Iraq, and Afghanistan were not the noble missions they thought they had signed up for. \n\nMany of them did a ton of humanitarian work while they were in the military by distributing food, disaster relief, medical relief, helping to build infrastructure, and act as peacekeeping troops in conflict areas.

Everyone who's unvaccinated has additional restrictions placed on them as to which buildings they can/can't enter, they have to cover their faces wherever they go while us vaccinated members can uncover, and they are required to self-test every week with those really invasive nose swabs. Despite this it's apparently still not enough to compel them to get vaccinated so all they do is bitch about how their rights are being violated, but hopefully I won't have to hear that much longer when they finally get the boot.",

Bill tuition benefits that she would get if she stayed another year or more.\n\n\u201cI will have to forfeit that,\u201d said the mother of three children, including a newborn. Forgoing the tuition benefit, which she could transfer to her children, is worth it, she said. \u201cI have no doubt God will provide for me.\u201d'\n\nWhile I fully agree with the sentiment that for the most part, good riddance, this is a good example of the media over simplifying something to get more outrage. Saying that she could transfer her tuition to her child if she stayed one more year is vastly over simplifying this situation and pretty misleading. \n\nFrom the Airforce website on Transferability of Post-9/11 GI Bill.Benefits:\n'Eligibility requirements include, but are not limited to, service members who meet all Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility requirements, have completed six years of service, can commit to serving an additional four more years and have registered their dependents in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System.'\n\nSo even if she does only have to serve one more year, like she's been in 5 already, she would still have to be qualified and able to reenlist for another 4 years. Even if the AF didn't kick her out now they could just bar her from reenlistment (a thing they can do for almost any reason whatsoever because the American military is a self policing body that answers to almost no one) and that benefit is gone. \n\nAnother thought I had on this is, \"what if a lot of service members are just using this as an excuse to get out?\"\n\nSeems weird but hear me out. A lot of service members either regret joining or just decide they want out before their contract is over. But the only way that usually happens is from getting either discharged for some kind of bad or illegal activity/crime such as drug use or sexual assault, or getting \"chaptered\" for being overweight or failing multiple consecutive PT tests. The problem with that first kind is that you're going to get a dishonorable discharge and everyone knows why those are bad. But here's the thing: overweight and PT failure \"chapters\" usually end up getting a \"General discharge under honorable conditions\". Which aren't considered that bad. And what lot of people don't know is that you can get those upgraded later.\n\nGuess what most of the vaccine refusal chapters have been so far?\n\nFrom https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2021/12/17/dishonorable-discharges-for-covid-vaccine-refusal-off-the-table-as-military-separations-begin/\n\n\"Punishment for failing to follow the orders could have included a dishonorable discharge designation, a move that would bar those individuals from eligibility for a host of veterans benefits, including GI Bill assistance and Veterans Affairs home loans.\n\nBut Maj. Jim Stenger, spokesman for the Marine Corps, said that in nearly all of the cases so far, individuals received dismissals with \u201cgeneral, under honorable conditions\u201d designations. Ann Stefanek, chief of Air Force media operations, said that all of the discharged airmen were assigned status as honorable or general under honorable conditions.\"\n\nSo it seems to me like some of these people might just be using this as a good way to get out of their contract early. You still retain any benefits you've earned under this discharge designation, including veteran benefits, so you're good to go. This means the woman from above can still use her GI Bill herself because you only have to have 36 months of service to earn the full benefit.\n\nAll that and even I'm vastly over simplifying a lot of this. Just don't always swallow everything in a news article simply because it aligns with your beliefs.",

Grateful as we are to live in communities where honest differences can be respected, Christian Scientists are also mindful of the obligations all citizens have to respect the rights of others in their communities.*\n\n_For more than a century, our denomination has counseled respect for public health authorities and **conscientious obedience to the laws of the land, including those requiring vaccination.** Christian Scientists report suspected communicable disease, obey quarantines, and strive to cooperate with measures considered necessary by public health officials. We see this as a matter of basic Golden Rule ethics and New Testament love._\n\n*As for the issue of exemptions for vaccination in the law, Christian Scientists\u2019 perspective on this issue may be unique. In the past, many public officials have been broadly supportive of exemptions when these have not been considered a danger to the wider community. In more recent years, public health concerns relating to vaccinations have risen as exemptions from them have been claimed by larger numbers. Christian Scientists recognize the seriousness of these concerns.*\n\n*Most of our church members normally rely on prayer for healing. It\u2019s a deeply considered spiritual practice and way of life that has meant a lot to us over the years. So we\u2019ve appreciated vaccination exemptions and sought to use them conscientiously and responsibly, when they have been granted.*\n\n*On the other hand, our practice isn\u2019t a dogmatic thing. Church members are free to make their own choices on all life-decisions, in obedience to the law, including whether or not to vaccinate. These aren\u2019t decisions imposed by their church.*\n\n*The public controversy over vaccination has produced strong opinions\u2014and strong divisions\u2014on the competing concerns of public health and toleration of diversity. Whatever the right answer may be for any community, Christian Scientists hope that their long experience as a religious minority working in cooperation with society\u2019s majority might point to the possibility of resolutions based on mutual respect and understanding in the best interest of all.*\n\n*And most of all, we hope that our collective care and effort can promote public health and healing to all affected by disease and contagion around the world.*\n\n.\n\nMost people forget that the Christian Science Monitor has been one of the least partisan and most reliable news sources in teh world for probably a century on everything *except* medicine, and during the AIDS Crisis, once they bit the bullet and published an article on AIDS, that exception went away in my opinion.\n\nIf you want to read articles on any topic by people whose religion *mandates* them to tell the unvarnished truth, CSM is probably your best source, even for medical stuff.",

I have known dozens of military members who have been medically retired due to medical issues. If they are not able to deploy they are not able to stay in the military for 20 years. Its pretty cut and dry. \n\nIf you want to stay in for 20 years and be eligible for full retirement you must do everything in your power to stay healthy. Starts with avoiding injuries and bullets, but it also.includes eating healthy and staying in shape at the gym. \n\nThere are thousands of people out there who would like to join the military but they can't because they have medical issues.",

However, they can't actually say that or have it be official policy otherwise it would be admitting that it was discriminatory to those with sincerely held religious beliefs.  \n\nA religious belief doesn't necessarily need to conform exactly to a particular dogma to be sincere and valid for an individual.  I can be morally and ethically opposed to abortion because of my religious beliefs and as a result be opposed to vaccines that are developed using technology derived from past experimentation that utilized aborted fetal tissue.  The fact that the current technology was derived from past objectionable actions might be enough to be a moral quandary.\n\nIt doesn't require being hard coded into the Bible for it to be objectionable to someone.  The pope doesn't have to make an official proclamation for it to be a religious belief.  And it's not your right to tell someone that their belief is not valid.  For fucks sake, the majority of the world's population believes in a magic man in the sky.  I don't understand why people can't comprehend that some who believes in religion itself might also have sincerely held beliefs on this, regardless if it makes sense or not.\n\nSure, I think that the majority of exemptions filed are likely BS, but to have none approved demonstrates that there is definately an unwritten policy not to approve them.  \n\nAll these comments about they knew it when they signed up, or they've had others before, etc. take the position that someone isn't allowed to learn, or change their mind, or have a religious awakening.\n\nI'm a lifelong agnostic who believes EVERY religion is fantastical BS, invented by those in power to control the masses.  I'vs also been fully vaccinated even though I have many questions in the way it was developed and approved.  Yet I find it very depressing that the current bandwagon is being OK and even giddy about forcing people into a position where they have to choose between their livelihood being able to provide for themselves and their family or ruining their career for refusing to inject something into themselves that they don't agree with, for religious reasons or otherwise.  For all you noble heros out there who just spout off the \"for the greater good\" bullshit, go ahead and give yourselves two pats on the back for being such fantastic people.  You are so much better than those nasty, stupid, inconsiderate, anti-vaccinated people.",
