Even if there is de-facto evidence of your innocence, if the state just decides to shrug it off (which most of the limp dick fragile ego AGs do), you cannot get out of prison. \n\nSCOTUS has forced the federal government to look the other way. What this *really* means is that states can imprison anyone for any reason. Even having a constitutionally invalid trial (ineffective counsel) is not enough to save you anymore. If Texas, for instance, wants to execute you, ***they are going to execute you whether you are guilty or not***. We now live in a country of kangaroo courts and the federal government is powerless to help you.",

Happens sometimes.\n\nThis was a case like that. The man was innocent of the crime he was accused, the lawyer didn't care, didn't ask the prosecutor about the evidence the guy had that proved his innocence, and the guy was found guilty.\n\nShould be a pretty easy case for an appeal. Obviously the justice system got this wrong because of a bad lawyer, this is what appeals are for. \n\nWell the supreme court decided no. If your FIRST lawyer doesn't bring up evidence that proves your innocence, that's on you, there's no appeals. Appeals courts will only look at decisions and procedure, not facts, so fuck you and die for having a bad lawyer the first time. \"Innocence is not enough\" of a reason to bring in new facts to an appeal *about a case where your lawyer didn't bring up facts*.",

Plenty of people don't have time/energy to consider voting actively - so we give then the time And we sistine then with the message. A holiday in general means things like more TV programming, more curriculum at schools, more signage on billboards and yes, even more flyers for sales that mention this voting holiday\n\n  \n\n\nYou've heard the old adage of, \"why does coca cola advertise when they are number one? They're number one BECAUSE they advertise.\"\n\n  \n\n\nIt's the reason someone like trump had traction, repetition and exposure. Humans are simple, programmable things. Many saw trump in a shitty suit on shitty TV set for years saying, \"im a real golden business boy!!!\" And after time, enough people forgot he's actually, demonstrably, the single biggest loser in history when it comes to personal wealth. He fails at everything, even things most people can't fail at like casinos. But the repetition and exposure made all that go away because the average human is simple.\n\n  \n\n\nRegardless of your politics, we all need to vote. A voting holiday would help that in a myriad ways and the impact will only grow over time. Yes we need it, we need it yesterday.",

If one state could be convinced to try it, and if they saw a jumping turnout, that would sort of prove your point.\n\nI guess a general election might not be affected in the way I see it. Not many people would want to travel at the beginning of November because they\u2019d be traveling at the end for Thanksgiving. And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a great time to go hiking or tramping around some other city. The primary though, in the spring or early summer, I just see people going out of town and not bothering.\n\nWhat I would really like to say is more voter registration drives. Stacy Adams did something really important. Maybe what we need is a fleet of like 10 motorhomes to just drive around rural communities and register people to vote.\n\nThe other thing that bothers me, is everybody on the right bitches about unsafe elections and brings up the lack of ID cards. And everyone on the left says that getting ID cards is a hardship for some people, which I totally agree. But nobody ever brings up all the other things that are much harder to do without ID cards. How about a big ID card movement? How many people are limited in their ability to go to school, apply for jobs, open a bank account, rent an apartment, get a cell phone, because they can\u2019t prove that they\u2019re who they say they are. And how many people are held back in life because of this, and how many children can\u2019t move out of poverty because their parents are hampered this way?",
