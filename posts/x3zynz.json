You don\u2019t need a strong anything party, you need a strong muscular representative democracy. The Republican Party should be allowed to extinguish itself if it so wants, if they want to declare themselves against democracy, and take on only the most fringe supremacist positions, then it is the duty of those who do value democracy and the idea of citizens controlling government policy to utterly destroy such people through the democratic and legal process. Any resulting hegemonic party will inevitably split. We saw it before in America with Democratic-Republicans vs federalists, we\u2019ve had it in Britain with whigs, the ascendency the collapse of the liberals. It is the duty of the current Democratic Party to campaign as hard as they can to preserve the democratic system, and when they have eliminated the insurrection, there will be space for them to split into conservatives and progressive, and a new party system will be formed.",

So long as millions of human beings in every country had to sell their labour-power to a small minority of owners, and to sink into the most wretched misery if they could find no buyers, the so-called \u201cequality before the law\u201d remains merely a pious fraud, since the laws are made by those who find themselves in possession of the social wealth.
