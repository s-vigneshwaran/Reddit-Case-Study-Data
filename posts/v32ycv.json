She continued taking child support and leaving me extremely stressed with money struggles. \n\nLast month I took her to court and got those payments fully cancelled, and can now go after her for three years of illegal payments taken from me for 12,000 dollars. \n\nI'm not gonna take the money on the hope that that money will help my daughter, but it's hard to describe the relief when the judge declared my victory in the case and my freedom from basically being bled dry by a cheating witch. \n\nWatching her face when she realized she wasn't gonna be taking hundreds from me a month and the further horror on her face when she realized the turns had tabled... That was bliss. \n\nThere's hope for us yet, gentlemen. We're finally getting heard.... No pun intended.",

When I was at training over the course of 8 or so months there was a woman that ended up accusing her \"boyfriends\" of rape whenever they got tired of her shit or didn't do what she wanted. About a half dozen dudes got the boot on rape charges before they finally realized it was a little suspicious and did an investigation showing that she was lying. She ended up getting kicked out on charges and I think the charges against the dudes got dropped but they still got kicked out to be homeless.\n\nSome other dude asked during one of our sensitivity/sexual assault prevention classes what to do if someone makes a false accusation and the instructor flatly said that never happens and he got escorted out to get his ass chewed over just asking.\n\n\nI'm married and I have zero issues with women in general but fuck if women's privilege isn't rampant in the military. Like 90% of the places I've been only dudes ever have to do the cleaning or manual labor bullshit, women can call out for any reason especially if they have kids, shit I've even seen women get out of doing night shifts or any other mildly inconvenient job by literally just crying about it.\n\n\nShit, technically the military says the women CANNOT consent if they've had any drinks at all. Not even \"drank until drunk or comatose\" explicitly if you share a drink or two with a girl and have sex the man can be accused of rape in those circumstances. No one cares if the man drank though, always his fault.",

          "text": "Defence attorney here:\n\nThe problem usually isn\u2019t one of \u201cbullshit claim\u201d. 99% of the time, the women truly and genuinely believe they were abused. They\u2019re not lying. It\u2019s not that clear-cut. \n\nThe problem much more usually is, \u201cis what she thinks was abuse actually abuse under the law\u201d, and you have to take context into account, because it\u2019s almost always a case of gradually declining norms over time. Like the frog in water being brought up to a boil, they don\u2019t see how bad it is until it\u2019s way too late. \n\nFor example, if your gf takes your phone away for an hour and won\u2019t give it back, that\u2019s annoying. It isn\u2019t abuse. On its own. And if she slaps you on the arm in play, it\u2019s not assault. On its own. \n\nBut if you\u2019re in a 5-year toxic relationship where you fight 5-10 times a day, and she frequently calls you a manipulative asshole and you frequently call her a useless whore and it\u2019s gotten so loud that the neighbors have called the police out a couple of times\u2026those maybe start to look like abuse to third parties. So when she goes and talks to her friends and they all tell her you\u2019re abusive and she needs to call the police and leave you\u2026she starts to genuinely believe she\u2019s being abused, and to frame all of your actions in that lens. \n\nSo then one day you get home after an insanely long shift, and she meets you right at the door with a long laundry list of petty chores she wants done, and you\u2019re tired and just want to sit and clear your head for 30 fucking minutes, and she won\u2019t back off, and after 5 minutes of arguing on the doorstep you shove past her to get in, and you accidentally shove a bit harder than you mean and she falls and gets a bruise and calls the police\u2026and now you\u2019re defending assault charges in a domestic abuse context. \n\nLooked at in isolation, it\u2019s bullshit. Looked at in the context of the relationship, it might STILL be bullshit. But looked at from the court\u2019s perspective, where maybe 10% of all cases they see are domestic violence\u2026it might not look like bullshit. The court might see a very familiar story of gradual escalation, that\u2019s going to lead to someone beating the shit out of someone else soon. So now you have an assault charge. And you\u2019re *convinced* it was bullshit, and she\u2019s *convinced* it was abuse\u2026and you\u2019re both kind of right and kind of wrong. \n\nWas Amber Heard abused? Probably. At a minimum, he was a towering asshole. It depends on how you define abuse. Was he also abused? Yes. Clearly. No question. The court got this one right, imho. \n\nBut if you\u2019re only looking at a case like this to reinforce things you already believed, you\u2019ll miss that complexity and only see injustice as a result.",

Faced with a portrait of a relationship in which there\u2019s compelling evidence of violence and toxic behavior on both sides, our culture seems unable to accept that we may simply be looking at a story without heroes. Instead, we demand a tidy narrative with a heroic redemption arc.*",

It\u2019s sad that it took all of this to clear his name - and that would be just as sad if it had come out that he was a piece of shit.\n\nHer commuting perjury to defend her outright lies is testimony to the scorched earth strategy false accusers will go through to \u201cwin.\u201d Fuck her.\n\nI also hope this will discourage more false accusers from making it worse but I have no more faith in humanity.",
