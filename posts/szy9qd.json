I mean, even 2 hours in the gym a week ( or doing shit at home)significantly improve your life.\n\nWhere i absolutely agree with, is that very few people exept actors and professional models have time to archieve this bodytype, because on top of 12-20 hours in the gym a week, a dialed in nutrition plan and most times a dedicated support staff, this requires a boatload of steroids and other performance enhancing drungs.",

You are coping pretty hard over here.\n\nWhat you said, is that \"most people with real jobs dont have time for the gym\".\n\nThat is objectively false. Most people do have time for the gym/some workout at home (seriously, squats, deadlifts and pushups work great for beginners) but dont want to do it because it takes effort. Most people dont work 70 hours a week. Most people have the half hour every two days to do something for their overall mental and physical health.\n\nI am not saying that those things are true for you personally, you might or might not be the exeption.\n\n It is objectively great for your body, improves posture, relieves stress, enhances dopamine and ahould even be encouraged by a lot of employers because even a modicum of physical activity boosts the productivity.\n\nAnd if you dont have that 2 hours a week, do an hour. You can always make time for 2 half hours a week.\n\nI worked 60-70 hours a week until a few months back. Still had time for the gym. When i was working as a paramedic, we would do stuff like pushups and buddy deadlifts in the locker rooms to keep fit.\n\nYou can choose to do nothing at all for your physical health, but it will be detrimental in the long term. If you have a white collar ofdice job, you are going to get severe posture problems. If you have a job that involves physical labour, a basic physical training prevents injuries and reduces the work effort. \n\nSeriously, get real and dont project your insecureties on other people.",

I just also know a lot of women who don't like the look and more so, don't like being with a guy physically that cut, I've been told it's uncomfortable but I don't know because Im not attracted to it lol",

A lot of women, myself included, like fit guys which can include very muscular guys, and I don't really see that as a problem? What I said was that the specific \"cut\" aesthetic can be less appealing.  Can't speak for all women but from my perspective it is just too extreme of a look, and indicates that the person will have to dedicate a lot of time and head space to their look above other things. \n\nAlso, women (and men) can have sex, date or be with whomever they choose, it's not a judgment on you personally and there's no need to post nasty remarks implying that any woman who enjoys sex or hooks up with a muscular man is somehow dishonest or shallow.   You may also be shocked to hear that people sometimes apply different preferences to casual hookups than they do to longer term relationships.",

Even Arnold significantly slimmed down for T2, and I would hardly scoff at anything he's ever done. Cavill went from a string bean to what we see now, which is pretty good. Dude is also 6'1. A lot harder to get looking like that when you're that tall. I would love to see your miller light dudes take off their shirt and look remotely like that. Lifting heavy and eating like shit isn't peak fitness and being some douchebag who works out excessively doesn't give you credentials. I workout 4 days a week and train with former bodybuilders. I would kill to look like him without having to sacrifice my entire life and pump myself full of dull meals. My friends, who have competed and won competitions, don't look like that anymore. Your view is skewed and maybe it has little to do with how you look or how you think others look, but a shitty mindset. Have fun with your future heart disease.",

You also said he only had to eat 2500 calories a day to build that physique, which is false. You said he looks mediocre, which is something 99% of people would disagree with. I'm arguing that your opinions aren't based in reality, and that just because he doesn't look like a world class professional bodybuilder, does not mean his physique is \"mediocre.\" And I use the word attractive, because to me \"good physique\" means attractive, fit, muscular physique. Which he objectively has. And you're out here crying because he looks better than you and you don't get the attention he does.",

That'll happen if you run out of fuel, but is a lot easier if you just avoid carbs entirely and are in ketosis 24/7. You can eat sugar and lose weight, but it's a lot harder because any time your body is using sugar for energy it won't use any fat for energy.\n\nPlus, to really look good you need to have less water weight, and part of that is definitely zero sugar for at least the last couple weeks before you're on camera. Though avoiding sodium is more important for that. \n\nAnd when you're pushing that level of hypertrophy multiple days off per week just isn't gonna give you enough volume. And you don't need much recovery time if you take steroids, eat enough (a shit load of) protein, and get 9 hours of restful sleep every night. \n\nIf you already have that muscle hitting each muscle once a week is enough to maintain, but if you're trying to build it quickly you're better off not having many rest days (as long as you do everything else you need to do to recover quickly).",

Your body converts carbs into energy, I believe, just like you mentioned with sugar and fat.\n\nWater weight is a good point, but as you mentioned, that's like 2-3 weeks before you're on camera, not through the whole process.\n\nWell yeah, if you're on steroids, everything about recovery changes. I've only done research on natural bodybuilding, so fair enough. Regardless though, people who want to look like him probably don't have a deadline of less than a year to transform their bodies, so they shouldn't be using PEDs, and thus should probably be working out around 3 days a week, which makes the process easier.",

This sounds like you're agreeing with me but the tone seems like you're not. If you want to lose body fat you need your body to use stored fat as energy. Whether consumed or stored, there a big difference in the mechanisms of using fat or carbohydrates as energy.\n\nAnd we're talking about looking like thor here. To get to that level, you're talking about 15-20 + hours a week...3 days a week just isn't gonna cut it. You'll only build muscle with that kind of volume if you're starting off pretty out of shape, and you'll need to up it as you increase strength and stamina. \n\nI've never taken a ped in my life and never will, but I've gone months without a rest day with like a 5-10% drop in the weight I could handle, and those were the times I really tacked on muscle. You can't do that without eating a surplus, but you're not going to build muscle and lose fat at the same time if you're starting from the point these actors do or even close to it.",

They happen to be the carbs your body can turn into usable energy with the lowest expenditure of existing energy (aka high glycemic index), but when it comes to macro calculations you should probably be rolling them into one because there's little difference between sugar and bread or pasta as far as your body's concerned. It basically just takes a little longer to digest complex carbs and they're like 3.9 calories per gram instead of 4 (numbers made up, idk the exact numerical difference) by the time it expends energy to digest them, whereas sugar is usable in it's existing form.",

What really matters is getting your body to use fat, which happens in a state called \"ketosis.\" Which I want to preemptively point out is very very different than ketoacidosis which you'll find if you look it up, I've had people confuse the two before. \n\nThere's a lot of ways to get into ketosis. The simplest is just to not eat carbs at all and you'll be in ketosis all the time, but you also have to space out protein which can be hard if you're seriously bodybuilding and very hard if you're in a bulk; I've done it but it isn't as efficient. I think an easier way, for most people, is intermittent fasting. But you can also just be in a deficit all the time, consuming less than your basal metabolic requirements for the day and spacing the calories out evenly. Different things work better for different people. \n\nBut again, the goal of any of it is to be in a state of ketosis and caloric deficit at the same time so your body directly uses body fat as energy.",

They\u2019ve got sports doctors and professional trainers who have worked together to devise the optimal program for that person. So, sure, you can do a version of it. But the Marvel version is likely going to be way more efficacious, because of the amount of knowledge that these people bring to it. Unless you have a lot of time to study all of these aspects, you just won\u2019t know all of the tricks to maximize your routine. And, you still have to do a bit of work to figure out even a basic version of this to make sure you\u2019re not accidentally doing actual damage to your body. So, sure, you can. But Marvel does it for you and does it better than you can. So just send in your audition tape already. ;)",

Anybody on the planet can do this. First thing\u2019s first: if you have job\u2014like a 9-5 job\u2014quit that. Do you like food? Forget about that. Because you\u2019re never going to enjoy anything you eat. Alcohol? Sorry. That\u2019s out. So what you need to do\u2014you have a chef, right? like a personal chef?\u2014make sure the chef makes you a lot of chicken breast. And make sure you keep your caloric intake at a certain level. And as you go to your physician 2-3 times a week\u2014just to monitor all your testosterone levels\u2014because testosterone is important to building muscle. You\u2019re good friends with\u00a0the trainer from Magic Mike? Arin Babaian. So you want to give Arin a call. And you want to make sure he\u2019s at your house and takes you to the gym at least twice a day, because you\u2019re gonna want to do your muscle-building in the morning and then your cardio in the afternoon. Now, do you have a family? Like a significant other or kids? Yeah, forget about them. You\u2019re not going to have time to deal with them.\n\n\"So that\u2019s really all you have to do. And make sure you have a studio pay for the entire thing, because it could become exceptionally expensive. So, I think if you just do all those things, then you too can have an absolutely unrealistic body type, such as me.\"",

Kind of like someone reminding people that professional photographers have years of experience, both with actually taking pictures and even more with editing pictures to look like they aren't edited (at least for nature and model photography), and that your pictures probably aren't going to be anywhere near as good. That doesn't mean you shouldn't try at all, just that you should be realistic about your goals when you do try, and to not be disappointed when you're not doing what the best in the world are able to do.",

If you look at his before and after photos, he went from \u201cguy with dad bod who looks like he\u2019s never played a sport in his life\u201d to a (somewhat literal) superhero body. \n\n>very realistic over the course of a year\n\nYeah but that\u2019s not what happened.  He didn\u2019t just lose 20 pounds.  He lost a lot of weight, and then gained it back tenfold in pure muscle, while also somehow maintaining a low bodyfat ratio.  You need to consume a lot to grow that fast in under a year.  \n\n>dehydration\n\nBruh what?  That\u2019s opposite of what you want.  Models often lift weights right before a photo shoot to get that pump, as their muscles swell with fluids\u2026 including water\u2026 I even have a pump supplement that causes the muscles to absorb more water, thus causing the user to look bigger for a few hours while it\u2019s active.  His muscles would look a lot smaller if dehydrated.  And if he was on creatine (which is basically a prerequisite for this level of bodybuilding at this point) he could  risk some serious bodily harm.  The only times I hear of people cutting water weight through dehydration is when a wrestler/mma fighter wants to make the cut during weigh-ins.  \n\n>this is more than possible without steroids\n\nOh of course, but for Kumail\u2026?  Can\u2019t say I agree.  He doesn\u2019t have the natural genetics (at least from what I\u2019ve seen in the before pictures), he hasn\u2019t been doing fitness for a long time like Chris Hemsworth (although I highly doubt that even he is natural), and the fact he\u2019s in his 40s.  You can still exercise and build muscle in your 40s but you\u2019re sure as shit not going to be able to do it nearly as fast.   \n\nAnd seriously, that pseudoscience he peddled in his men\u2019s health bit just got me heated\u2026 don\u2019t use electrical stimuli pads\u2026 your muscles will feel sore, but I guarantee you, they will make no change to your body.  There are a bunch of those ab shockers on Amazon for a pretty affordable price.  If you don\u2019t believe me, buy one, use it for a month, and tell me how well it worked out for ya, lol.",

Because it is really difficult and take a long time to elevate your body to that level of strength.  Especially when you call that kind of muscle \u201cdecent\u201d. That muscle mass isn\u2019t \u201cdecent\u201d.  Dude has 18 inch biceps.  He is jacked.  It may not sound crazy, as Hollywood paints that picture, but how many people in your life do you know with that kind of physique\u2026?  Hell, you can go to the gym, and watch gym rats busting their ass in there and still not have that physique.  \n\n>it\u2019s totally reasonable to think that an actor with a dietician, a cook-\n\nDid you see his men\u2019s health piece?  Dude mainly eats chicken, broccoli, and rice\u2026 if you know how to cook those basic things, then congrats, you\u2019re eating like Kumale.  His diet is nothing groundbreaking\n\n>and a trainer\n\nA trainer can get you over the beginner hurdles and teach you what to do, but they\u2019re not going to magically make you bigger than somebody employing exercises that work\u2026 not saying you\u2019re among this group, but I never understood why some people think \u201cthe weirder the exercise, the stronger it makes you.\u201d\n\n>lose 20lbs pounds\n\nThat\u2019s a feat in of its own.  He claims to have done intermittent fasting.  This method forces you to eat JUST the bare minimum to survive, utilizing every last calorie\u2026 you\u2019re not going to be left with much muscle after this.  With how little your intake is, the human body is just incapable of sustaining a lot of muscle mass under this kind of prolonged deprivation\u2026 but let\u2019s say\u2026 ay, it\u2019s been 2 months.  You look like you just left a Russian PoW camp, but have very low body fat, now for gaining all that muscle mass\u2026\n\nYou need to pack on a LOT of protein and nutrients to get big after that\u2026 and to make the change as drastic and fast as Kumale, you can\u2019t just remain in the maintenance zone of calories, you need to be at a major surplus for your body to grow.  Now tell me how the human body is supposed to put all those pounds from your now DRASTICALLY changed diet, into only your muscles?  You can run, sure, but if you run too much, you tire out, and your body is less able to perform anaerobic exercises (basically lifting weights).  Are you seeing where I\u2019m going with this?  Your body has to pack on all those pounds, but unfortunately, there\u2019s no such thing as simply deciding where said mass goes.  And pair that up with the reduced metabolism that men get in their 40\u2019s and you have an even bigger problem.  Do you pack on pounds, push your muscles to the limit, and crank you strength to 11, or do you push your heart and nutrition intake to its limit to maintain an extremely low bodyfat percentage?  You\u2019re not going to be able to take both routes with only a year\u2019s timeframe.\n\nEnter steroids.  Cranks up your metabolism so you can eat, and burn that fat off better than a man still in his prime.   You can also recover faster so you can run, AND lift while your average person would be home sore and unable to go further without rest.  And your growth hormones would rise in number, forcing your body to put that protein straight into building muscle mass.\n\n>don\u2019t make excuses for your health\n\nSir or ma\u2019am, I am very healthy, and have been a gym rat since 19.  I can sculpt a 6 pack during the warmer months, however, not without the cost of losing muscle mass, gained from the bulking season.  However, the fact my body can do this is because I\u2019ve been doing this for years, and it has gone through a long process of bulking up with muscle and fat, then slimming down, shaving the fat, and sculpting the body, with more muscle remaining than fat, and then so on and so forth\u2026 this is how your average person builds their body to attain that type of physique.  Now don\u2019t get me wrong, there are definitely those very select few people out there with incredibly good genetics, and there are some meatheads who will argue this (Kali Muscle being very outspoken against this, despite few people ever believing he\u2019s a natty), but is how a man achieves that physique in a reasonable, sustainable, natural, and healthy way.  Don\u2019t confuse this with me bashing another man because I want validation.",

Anybody on the planet can do this. First thing\u2019s first: if you have job\u2014like a 9-5 job\u2014quit that. Do you like food? Forget about that. Because you\u2019re never going to enjoy anything you eat. Alcohol? Sorry. That\u2019s out. So what you need to do\u2014you have a chef, right? like a personal chef?\u2014make sure the chef makes you a lot of chicken breast. And make sure you keep your caloric intake at a certain level. And as you go to your physician 2-3 times a week\u2014just to monitor all your testosterone levels\u2014because testosterone is important to building muscle. You\u2019re good friends with the trainer from Magic Mike? Arin Babaian. So you want to give Arin a call. And you want to make sure he\u2019s at your house and takes you to the gym at least twice a day, because you\u2019re gonna want to do your muscle-building in the morning and then your cardio in the afternoon. Now, do you have a family? Like a significant other or kids? Yeah, forget about them. You\u2019re not going to have time to deal with them.\u201d\n\n\"So that\u2019s really all you have to do. And make sure you have a studio pay for the entire thing, because it could become exceptionally expensive. So, I think if you just do all those things, then you too can have an absolutely unrealistic body type, such as me.\"",

Looking like Chris Hemsworth in this picture however not only requires a perfect diet, you need to work out harder than you yourself ever could 5-7 times a week. And it doesn't end there. No, you have to take a boatload of supplements, down a shitload of protein shakes, make sure you optimize your recovery, and last, but certainly not least, take steroids.\n\nGaining significant amounts muscle is infinitely harder than staying thin could ever be. Just try it, and you'll see that it takes a shitload of effort to gain even a small amount of muscle. \n\nOver time, people have realized that it's unrealistic to expect all women to look like the most attractive celebrities. Yet, for some reason, some people still don't get that it is wildly unrealistic to expect men to have the body of a movie star. Most male actors who play superheroes take steroids. 99.9% of men physically cannot look like Chris Hemsworth does in this picture without them. That's reality for you.",

Working out for an hour straight is more energizing than tiring these days. \n\nIt takes years to look very cut and that's with doing some restrictive diets which may not be all that healthy at the end of the day.\n\nA lot of people train to become cut. Hell, I do want to be more cut and I've noticed I am getting more cut...but the most important thing with training is strength..endurance...your stamina. In fact, this is the thing that will likely improve fastest and the most. Superficial looks are not the goal of working out and anyone who thinks they should be is seriously misguided.
