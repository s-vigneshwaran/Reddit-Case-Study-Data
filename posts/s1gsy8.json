          "text": "There was a recent article claiming that women are suffering in the dating market. It explained how women don't enough have quality men to choose from and it cited college graduation rates as evidence. Women are graduating college at significantly higher rates than men meaning there arent nearly enough college educated men to go around. So the advice they offered to the suffering women is that they should be prepared to lower their standards and settle for a man without a degree. \n\nThis was a very insightful article into how some of these women view oppression. Men have a problem of lower graduation rates than women and this woman still interpreted it as a way that society is unfairly structured against her. She was completely blind to the issues men may be facing and could only view it through the prism of how this negatively impacts her. \n\nIn short there is literally nothing that can ever be done to placate these twitter harpies and they will always see themselves as oppressed.",

There are studies that indicate that women typically have a strong preference for men of higher socioeconomic status than themselves when initiating a relationship. I don't think knightblue4 is correct that men prefer women of lower status, but if women usually go for men of higher status, it could look like men are selecting women of lower status. \n\nI think that's just an optical illusion, though. Most of what I've read indicates that men writ large do not give a shit about the socioeconomic status of their women. Attractiveness is the thing men select for most of the time. Physical being ultimate, and emotional attractiveness second (ie. if a girl is nice to you and gives you attention, you'll think of her as more attractive overall). How useful a woman will be as a mate and life partner is often overlooked in favor of \"she make my pp hard.\"\n\nI married my wife because she made me feel good and I thought we could grow together. I hadn't even considered her earning potential or social skills as possible factors in our relationship until this very conversation.",

Yeah, it's basically the same thing, women are the biggest supporters of eugenics.\n\nWas thinking about all that talk of toxic masculinity these days and it dawned on me, when has a woman helped any men? They like to pretend our beliefs are served to push each other down but most men who are actually virtuous will try to raise others, I've had and did help many guys through my life, it's what makes most of us strong enough to have a personality or whatever. \n\nOnly the weak spirited will put others down and it seems woman are happy to take that as the main male archetype because it serves them well to think that their sadist views are normal.",

They work on their bodies and skin and hair with a passion. Femboys rarely actually want to be women tho. Lol trans women start off not so hot. Attractive males can easily become an attractive woman. But really attractive males are the trans norm.  Lol and some trans women dont even fucking shave after the axe or try to do anything to keep their body up. Almost as if they mistakenly believe that changing genders is some magic cure all.  They no longer feel they have to do the millions of things women do to stay attractive because they are women now and thats enough. Look at poor girl on TV, Jazz. Shes like a thousand pounds now and is slowly devolving in front of our eyes its fucked up. Also im gay.",

I interact with trans people a fair bit, but once in my life have I ever met someone who qualified for sex reassignment surgery but hadn't laser hair removal or electrolysis. \n\nLike, surgeons here in the West will outright refuse to preform the procedure in a situation like that. \n\n>or try to do anything to keep their body up.\n\nThat much I won't disagree with, but at the same time it's not something that I would *expect* to see across the board, either.\n\nLike, the overwhelmingly vast majority of transgender people aren't driven to transaction out of a desire to be sexually attractive in the first place. There are going to be transgender people who don't prioritize their fitness or appearance just like there are cisgender people who do the same. At the end of the day, the central goal is to get the dysphoric symptoms to stop by providing certain structures of the brain with the set of sex hormones that they're errantly configured to respond properly too. \n\nThat's why cross-sex hormone replacement therapy has the solid backing of the medical community for use in the treatment of properly diagnosed gender dysphoria. It's reliably proven to yield both the greatest reduction in suicidality rates and the greatest increase in quality of life metrics of all methods of treatment known to medical science at this time.\n\nIt's not like the whole twink or femboy aesthetic where only people with the appropriate traits and desire to present themselves that way actually count as twinks or femboys; gender dysphoria is an indiscriminate medical condition that affects it's sufferers whether they want it to or not.\n\n\n-\n\n>Look at poor girl on TV, Jazz. Shes like a thousand pounds now and is slowly devolving in front of our eyes its fucked up. \n\nI really don't follow reality TV so my knowledge is pretty limited, but isn't she literally attending Harvard? That doesn't really strike me as something you can do while you're \"devolving\".\n\nDon't get me wrong, by no means am I arguing that you're obligated to be attracted to her or anything, and the dangers of obesity go without saying. But what makes her different than any other fat man or woman?",

I'll tune in and out and my brothers girlfriend keeps me posted. But nah she's definitely devolving. Harvard isn't a certainty anymore and her family is pretty worried about her. Shes lost all motivation it seems. She is no different than any other fat person so I think it's interesting that I get investigated when I say I'm not attracted to her.",

Do their facial features seem a bit different? It's things you might see as minor that are actually very noticeable because they're very unique. Humans are very sensitive to human facial features and body proportions, so it's not like you only find them when looking for it.             \nStill, I guess you do have more experience, so I can't refute you without seeing the people you're referring to.",

It's one of the reasons why those timelines are misleading - you can take a picture from a good angle, put some filters, and pretend that's how they appear in reality. When looking at the body, however, their proportions are weird. There's a reason why most of these pics are either only from the face or with the shoulder tilted. Most of the time the face is already weird even at a crafted angle, but things like hand sizes, hip to shoulder ratio, height, etc are very different and combine to give it away. While people won't go \"hum his h-t-s ratio is that of a male\", they do notice it even if they don't understand it. It's a series of factors that might not be giveaways by themselves, but that are all present and make it stand out. The voice is almost always a big factor, but I've seen some cis guys mimic woman voices before so I guess it's a lottery.          \nCis women may have masculine characteristics, but not in the abundance that mtf do. \nIf by convincing you mean people don't usually turn their heads as they walk down the street, then sure.

You're just visualizing a mustache twirling villain whose greatest joy is bothering transsexuals, when in reality it would be very awkward to do so. \n\n>...Isn't that kind of in agreement with their statement, though?\n\nWell, no, because they could still be right about most transsexuals being ugly regardless of their ability to clock them. The original statement implies they believe them to be ugly because those are the ones they can clock, but just because some might avoid clocking doesn't mean they avoid being both trans and ugly. Of course, that's assuming the statement about them being worse at clocking them is right, but I'm arguing that even if that were to be true it still wouldn't be enough to completely rebuke the original proposition about transsexuals appearance.",

How were rates affected when the trans people were accepted by family, friends, and work? Did that have an impact? Youve obviously read the study, so you should know the answer. \n\n>I think it's hilarious because I get to read the stories on /detrans and other platforms about trans regretting and finally waking up when it's too late and the fallout thay goes with it.

That should be all anyone needs to hear, we're still human, and that humanity is not based on whether or not were fuckable like, lmao.\n\nEventually, youre going to realize, yeah theres a lot of people coopting the trans label, but you know what? They will figure it out and move on to the next trend, and it was silly to worry about people who never had any intention of transitioning. Those that are cis that do try to transition, I hope they learn their fucking lesson. But dont pity them. They're fucking dumb. Its their life, their mistake. \n\nThe answer is not to start hating people who just want to live their life, without their existence being up for debate, and then also if their existence should even be allowed, by people who have no personal experience with it. \n\nIn fact we have the opposite problem too, cis people telling cis people what we want, like the whole genital preference shit, idk where the fuck that has come from, but honestly, no fucking sane trans person is going to think mainstream trans shit, because theres barely any actual trans people in it. \n\nIf you have a way to fix my dysphoria, dont keep it to yourself, speak up. Til then, dont judge how people handle it, it could just as easily be you, homie. I mean, ig do judge cuz people do wild shit, but judge them for their actions, not what they cant help. \n\nI'm not inherently fucking crazy because I'm trans, like, we are literally people.",

I agree we should respect others but promoting trans versus educating is not how it should go.",

But like I said originally, the movement takes any criticism, no matter how small, and blows it up to \"you want us dead\". \n\nIt doesn't matter though. You clearly don't care about what I have to say. You just want to be outraged and upset because you like the power that comes with being an inquisitor for trans rights on reddit.

Remember that it's not all transgender who act like that, you only see the ones that act crazy and deluded online because they are acting crazy and deluded. I bet you've met transgenders who you never even knew were, and they acted completely normally. In my experience, and as sad as it is for them, it tends to be the ones that don't 'pass' that are crazy and possibly creepy. Secondly you should know there is a physical known medical cause of it, it's not enough to make it diagnosable but it is statistically significant - the brains of transgender people tend to be closer to the gender they identify as over their primary characterised (genital) sex. The reason I was so specific about the words there is because not everyone has chromosomes which match their sex, which is normally irrelevant but this is already an exception to begin with. Secondly hormones do change your sex, specifically your hormonal sex. Sex is defined by a mixture of characteristics, hormones and secondary sexual characteristics being two of them - so it is not accurate to call a fully transitioned transgender woman a male. There are both sociological and biological reasons to classify them as a female, and sometimes as a male. [For example, they have cancer rates pretty much identical to a woman - in fact a lot of medical things use 'female' for fully transitioned transgender women because otherwise it gives incorrect results/effetcs/etc]. Of course, and even more so if they do this after puberty, there are always some things they can't change and should be classified as male for - but it's a lot smaller of a list of things than many seem to believe.\n\nI hope I have taught you something you didn't know, or at least made you think about your position on hating them all, or thinking they're all unstable. (Because really, there are transgender people I know who I've hated too, and some who were super nice, and those happened to be the ones I didn't even know about it until they told me [or in one case I accidentally found out])",

EDIT: this is only true for grey matter volume. See the reply for changes in different structures. Not sure if these changes are 'enough', but I certainly downplayed it due to ignorance. Second, having a different brain structure after being identified as transgender doesn't mean they became transgender because of it. It could be that the brain structure was altered either by a common factor to transgenderism or by some factor induced by being transgender.         \nSecond, sex is defined by what the individual is, and the sexual dimorphic characteristics don't make it so someone is x% male and y% female. I get what you're saying, but I can't agree that inducing changes by external supplementation is enough to change the sex of an individual just because certain characteristics change. They might modify those parts, but being male or female mostly depends on key features that we currently can't mimic, such as generating reproductive gametes and having a vast majority of your features being female.              \nOverall, I understand you care about whoever is in your life that is transgender and their well being, but I don't believe your points are that strong. I guess it's fair to want them to not be hated by the action of others, but that doesn't change my personal opinion about the issue itself - they still aren't able to become the opposite gender despite trying to, and I don't believe that they are able to support their belief of being the opposite gender scientifically (speaking of those who believe that of course).",

                      "text": "Yes, my research focused strictly on grey matter volume, which is the one I was aware of. I failed because I specifically researched only the subset I knew existed, and it blinded me to other research. Thank you for the correction, for it also made me realize a mistake I made during the search that I could have repeated in different topics.         \n\nRegarding your research, I don't have much free time as of now to look closer, but I'll try to comment on it and maybe I can learn something of it.        \n        \nIt seems that the main known effect is on the stria terminalis region. I'm not sure what to think of the apparent fact that it only becomes different enough at a late age (~22), but that's something to think about.       \n\nI don't really like the one from Garcia and Swaab, because I see the argument that post-menopause women demonstrating that hormones don't affect the region as weak. It certainly did affect the castrated males for example. Also, it could simply be that the changes are not quickly undone when concerning the hormones relevant to menopause, or that reducing all those hormones together isn't the same as increasing the ones in the transsexual treatment. If it could be shown with pre-treatment transsexuals I'd be more convinced.           \n\nThe ones that talk about grey matter are the ones I was aware of. According to this article [(link)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0004867421998801) it is only relevant on the posterior cingulate gyrus after accounting for hormones in ftm. For mtf, your research points towards greater grey matter mass on the left puttamen, while the one I found had it on the right putamen [(link)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754583/). Not sure why they differ in the side or if that has any implications, but at least it seems the putamen is affected.            \n\nOn the twin studies, while it does show that some of the traits are heritable, it also shows that it isn't purely genetic (as the last article explicitly put it). Also, having a heritable component isn't the same as the brain structure being the heritable trait. They could be both due to a trait that changes their hormonal expression or how likely they are to become transgender given a certain variable in their ambient, and the changes in brain structure is a direct consequence of that or a consequence of becoming transgender due to those traits. But I get your point - that it is unlikely that transgenderism is not caused by biological variables, which does seem to be the case. I'm not sure to what extent, however, there being a biological variable is the same as their brain structure validating their feelings of being a part of the opposite gender. In other words, does heritability imply their brains are primed to behave like the opposite gender, or simply that they are more likely to identify as transgender?            \n\nOk, that's about the time I have. Thank you for the sources. If anything I asked is in any of these studies, please tell me, for I did not have time to read most of them beyond the abstract and a few select points.",

But what you wear, who society expects you to marry, your attitudes, your name, how you interact with people--it's all gendered to some degree, but a lot of these traits (if not most of them) are gendered for weird/historical reasons, and are not actually hardwired to your biological sex. Do you think it's valid for someone to say \"I don't identify with any social construct of a certain gender. I prefer to be called by a different name and pronouns, and be generally treated as my preferred gender.\"? Shouldn't we be free to decide which gender norms should apply to us? \n\nImagine if I had been born in Washington but grew up in Florida. I might want to identify as \"being from Florida\". Would it be reasonable for people to yell at me and challenge me for asserting this just because I \"can't change the fundamental fact that I was born in Washington?\" What if the majority of my cultural ties are to Florida? What if I don't give a shit about Mount Rainier and the Seahawks? Wouldn't it be weird if people got mad that I cheered for the Dolphins instead of the Seahawks, just because I wasn't born in Florida? Wouldn't it be weird if people started gatekeeping Miami culture from me, telling me I'm not a REAL reggaeton fan and NEVER WILL BE because I wasn't born there? Sure, maybe I have to hit up the Washington state house to get my birth certificate or early medical records--can't change that. But otherwise, would it really make sense for me to identify as \"from Washington\"? \n\nSo why is it so hard for people to--at the very least--accept transpeoples' pronouns and names?",

Also, to make the comment shorter I'll comment only on mtf, but you can just switch the nouns for the ftm case.)        \n\nI believe claiming gender is separated from biological sex is pretty silly. Just because certain behaviours are expected from people of a certain gender doesn't mean your gender and it's gender roles aren't heavily tied to your biological sex.                   \n\nSo no, I don't think it's very valid because the way the concept of changing gender is framed implies that changing the gender roles you follow makes you fulfill all the requirements to be of that certain genre, when really many of the characteristics of the gender are heavily tied to both the differences between the sexes and the interest of one sex towards the other. I do not mind a man wearing a dress and going about as a woman, I do care that they assert they have become a women and that I must treat them as if there was no difference. The pronouns (assuming we're limiting ourselves to she/he/it) are a bit trickier, since it's a compromise about transmitting accurate information and being polite. By \"I do care\", I mean \"I do believe they are wrong\", not necessarily \"I do believe they must be stopped by law\". So no, not all gender norms can be decided because not all of them are independent of your biological sex.          \n\nAs a side note, many activities gendered because of historical reasons that often come to be because of sexual differences. Women didn't use to stay at home at random for example, it was because of their child rearing function, which is due to their biology (both pregnancy and hormonal profile incentivizing it). Some things like blue/pink are kind of arbitrary, but even then they have some sort of reason (aggressive colors like red/pink are more manly, which makes the current trend a bit weird. I guess our pink is softer though.). I don't think \"most of them\" are really arbitrary, specially not the ones people think about when thinking about transsexuals. For example, courtship behaviour is something that has both arbitrary traits and at the same time traits completely dependent on the relation between both sexes.\n\nYour analogy with states fails because it misses a point. There's nothing intrinsic about being born in Washington or Florida. Your analogy becomes much more nonsensical if you were someone white claiming to be black for example. You could still like rap, but claiming you're a different race would be clearly wrong. I don't think analogies are a good idea for this case, because you can create hundreds of analogies were someone is of a certain group but wants to be of a different group and have a hundred reasons why it is reasonable or not in each case.               \n\nIt's hard to accept because of many reasons, which aren't the same for everyone. Some people just hate any kind of gay behaviour for example. However, it should be made clear that being a woman and adopting behaviours that are traditionally for women are two different things, and that's a big part of why transsexuals are pushed back. Their core philosophy is at odds with what most people consider true, so any concession made comes from empathy and not from agreeing with it. Some people just consider the truthfulness of a premise more important than the feelings of others, and get annoyed when they feel like they're being forced to accept a flawed argument by means of social pressure. It's what many of the people here said - \"I don't hate transsexuals but I hate the movement\", because it's the movement that does the second part the hardest. Once they become irritated enough, they push back on the concessions made by empathy because they no longer have any to spare.",
