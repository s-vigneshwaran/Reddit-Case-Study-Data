The thing is I knew i would be alone for a long time because my mom was visiting family in another city. Anyway i get down to business and get on the verge and keep doing this for about 2 hours. When i decide fuck it and blow my load i swear it was the most amount of nut i've ever seen but it was over quickly because i passed out. I woke up with a towel over me and nut all over my stomach and my mom who was back quicker than she was supposed to and she brought the family over. It was the most embarrassing thing thats ever happened to me and there was a live audience with front row seats to the reason i can't sleep at night. I never lived it down and people still tease me to this day.\n\nTL;DR : I nutted so hard that i passed out and my mom and some family walked in on me with nut everywhere.",

When you experience vasovagal syncope, your vagus nerve essentially misfires by interpreting stress on your body as being something that is going to make your bp/hr go too high so, it over corrects and drops everything so you pass out. This isn\u2019t inherently problematic itself, but rather the circumstances surrounding it. For example: Passing out and falling/injuring yourself. More dangerous is aspirating (vomiting) into your lungs as this could trigger similar symptoms that you would normally see in a seizure. Alcohol consumption will impact this as well (like most things in life, more EtOH = more problems).",

Anyway, my buddy decided he wanted to end his night with a bang. So he asked me if I had some porno vhs on me? So as a man of culture and purveyor of such things, I said of course I have a bunch in my room. So he borrowed at least 3 to 5 tapes as he was gonna get busy, haha. By the way, this was around 3 am in the morning. So long story short, he tried to do the deed. Woke up pants down, dick in hand while his family was having lunch. Forgot to mention their vhs player was in the living room which is in a common area with the dining room. You might think nobody even tried to cover him up with a blanket, his mom did. But it was hot, so of course he threw it to the side. Worst thing about this, it was his mom who told me this story.",
