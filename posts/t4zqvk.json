This would mean 20 new power plants to compensate for no more gas.\n\nHowever, heating your home with electricity is much more efficient, with an average of 2450 KWh/year.

          "text": "THANK YOU\n\nI am a Spaniard who's lived both in the NL and the UK and 1000% agree\n\nBritish food on its own is good but perhaps a bit monotonous after a while - that being said Brits are adventurous eaters and so they've got a great variety of foods - I'd go as far as to say I've never eaten as well as in the 3 years I lived in London\n\nThe Netherlands however... Holy shit. Their food is so fucking sad. Like who the fuck willingly eats a sandwich for lunch and then stamppot for dinner, it's like they don't want to enjoy things",

The only two slow parts are the very first fireing up and cooling down 'rapidly' (open the window works just fine). Regular increasing of temperature is fast. 5\u00b0c per hour are normal in my flat.",

I thought Europe would be somewhat less hysterical in its response, Russian fuels being pretty important factors, but I guess when the power and heating bill is almost unnoticeable, it's pretty easy not to give a fuck about it doubling and forget not everyone is in the same situation. _cough_ politicians _cough_\n\n> The biggest issue ofc being Germany deactivating their nuclear powerplants, de facto best alternative fuel source.

If the interests of the general population are secondary to anything else, they _are_ fucking the general population, whether they intend to or not. And going by Fleming's \"Once is an accident, twice is coincidence, third time is hostile action\", there's no more room for the benefit of the doubt at this point.\n\n> the economy is global and you can't put pressure on one part without putting pressure on all the others, that's just the way it is\n\nTry not to put pressure on it then? Since the first Russian troop movement, I don't think I've seen a single attempt to de-escalate the situation. My memory isn't 100% and I could have missed it because I had other things to worry about as well, but as far as I recall it went from \"how dare Russia move troops around within their borders\" to \"IMMINENT RUSSIAN ATTACK\" to Russia meming about it to \"IMMINENT RUSSIAN ATTACK\" to actual Russian attack.\n\n> If paying more for gas means Ukrainians get to keep their sovereignity and Putin gets to speedrun killing himself in a bunker, I'm all for it.\n\nHaving lived on 650 euros a month + 80 ish in meal tickets while paying a rent of 470 with power, gas, heating, water and internet included, I prefer not having to ponder a scenario where that increases and I potentially have to pick between being warm and being fed, but you do you.",

It's _that simple_. to think Putin wasn't going to invade just because the west wouldn't be reporting on it in any way is stupid, this wasn't a rash decision like \"that's it, all I wanted was to move some troops along the borders of a free country for no reason at all, but now they're saying that's warmongering or some shit, THAT'S IT!\". This was planned months if not years ahead, luckily though it seems to have been planned poorly. But it has come to war and the repercussions of Ukraine just bending over are insane and will doom us all.\n\nTo your last point, I'm still comfortable financially so I get to talk shit and not get smacked. Hopefully things turn for the better for you in the future, or that you manage to climb up the ladder to comfort, or that you move somewhere else or whatever gives you a better quality of life.

Most electricity we use is gas fired. Gad fired powerplants can get up to 30% efficiency. Modern gas heating systems can approach 100% efficiency. Most people run them at 90-95% efficiency.",
