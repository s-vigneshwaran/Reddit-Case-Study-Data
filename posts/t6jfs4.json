I win!\"\n\nThe \"'logical fallacy' logical fallacy\" is on that same site, and tells them they still must support their arguments with reasoning and evidence. And it's not appropriate to dismiss someone else's argument that is reasoned and has evidence just because, \"ohh wait, you made 1 hyperbole!\"\n\nOne of my favorite \"trigger words\" for these people is slippery-slope, because it can be both. So it absolutely depends on how you structure the argument around it. An example of a logical fallacy is, \"Well if we let the gays get married, what's next? People will start marrying animals and toaster ovens!\" And a real life example would be from Nazi Germany, \"First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out, because I was not a socialist...\"",

Nazi Germany is a perfect example of it.\n\nBut per the other example, it *can also* be a logical fallacy. So really, it can be either/or.\n\nSo using \"slippery slope\" as an argument alone isn't enough to prove your position on a topic as true. Likewise, it's also not enough to say, \"slippery-slope is a logical fallacy! Your entire argument is invalid.\" It really relies on the context of the argument, how it's used. Which coincidentally applies to most of the other logical fallacies too. You can't just scream \"logical fallacy\" and declare yourself the winner. To win a debate you still have to actually *debate*: present your points, your reasoning, and any evidence you have to support them.\n\nEdit: that's why I like to pick on the \"slippery-slope logical fallacy\" in particular. The Nazi quote proves how slippery-slope concerns can ABSOLUTELY be proven true. But still, it shouldn't be the only basis for your argument.",

This example is in fact formally fallacious, *unless* it is supplemented with an additional premise: that climate scientists, taken as a whole, are a reliable source of knowledge about climate science.\n\nThis premise is strongly suggested by the initial claim. But if it is not actually implicitly contained in the argument, the argument is formally fallacious. Of course, in conversation we almost all take it for granted that climate scientists are reliable sources of knowledge about climate science; and so in conversation the argument is not substantively fallacious (albeit formally fallacious).\n\nThis is neat because it means that one who dismisses this argument on the grounds of it being an appeal to authority *must* *not be taking for granted the implicit premise*. The argument can be fallacious only if this premise is not taken for granted; so one who calls it fallacious does not believe that climate scientists are a reliable source of knowledge about climate science. At this point you have them by the balls: *they* must provide a substantive reason not to affirm the implicit premise in order to maintain their accusation of fallacy.",

If someone told you to accept some reasoning because the person is an expert you aren't wrong for questioning that. It's just that in that particular scenario it's not appropriate and makes no sense. If the guy wanted to question or contest the fundamental research that makes the expert, \"the expert\" than the proper way to do it would be to go publish his own research that proves the expert wrong. Real life isn't some TV show where you have a dramatic show down in front of a huge audience and suddenly everyone claps because they realize how wrong they were and thank you for showing them the way. If you don't want to listen to the expert, don't go to the event where people want to listen to the expert sharing his knowledge.\n\nNot every single thing is an open debate that is up for challenge. Fundamentally, I think the reason why it has devolved into this state is because of the lack of trust in each other and the basic systems of society. They feel they are right and have no way to be heard except to do it in that setting. How they've come to feel that way is something that I have a reasonable theory about. Some combination of simple 2 party systems (left vs right, right vs wrong, etc), tribalism, information overload, general abuse of power and authority, western cultural emphasis on individuality, declining socioeconomic standing of white males, etc.",

I pointed out that although the research found that there was a link to a small percentage of boys having the reaction, that the paper went on to say that the risk of getting the same side effect from contracting COVID was substantially higher, and that their findings suggested that a larger testing pool would be needed, since there\u2019s was relatively small in size and locality. My \u201cfriend\u201d said \u201cSEE, that\u2019s the world we live in now. Where everyone is saying my facts are better than your facts\u201d I knew it was pointless to continue the discussion from there.

The prosecutor gotcha'd the defenses psychologist (I won't lie to you it felt like a TV show with how slimy the guy felt), while the prosecutors psyche couldn't be shaken by the defenses questioning. After that cross examination of their (defense) psychologist they folded quickly after and settled lol.",

This means that arguments (an argument is not a debate, it is just a series of claims, i.e., declarative statements. Arguments are composed of one main claim called a conclusion, supported by other claims called premises) that use this fallacy in one of their premises are *invalid*.\n\nIn logic, arguments aren't \"strong\" or \"good\", and you dont \"win\" them. They are either valid or invalid, sound or not sound.\n\nA valid argument means that a conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, and a sound argument is both valid and has true premises.\n\nYou can have valid arguments with false premises, for example:\n\nAll bleeps are bloops.\nBlah is a bleep.\nTherefore, blah is a bloop.\n\nThat argument is valid, but it makes no sense to talk about the truth of its premises when I'm using made up terms.",

If a guy is an ancap then he's an asshole\n\n         2. this guy is an asshole\n            ----\n         3. therefore this guy is an ancap. \n\nWe can see this is invalid by considering the case where rather than being an ancap, our asshole is a neoliberal. \n\nWith informal arguments, the premises of an argument are supposed to give good reason to believe the argument's conclusion. An informal fallacy occurs when someone claims to be giving good reasons to believe but in fact is not.\n\nInformal fallacies are epistemological errors - they fuck up our ability to understand things about the world we live in . We study informal fallacies because they help us to evaluate whether or not we should believe some claim about the world is true. \n\nFormal fallacies are mistakes about the rules for the way formal terms fit together.  We study formal fallacies because they help us understand the characteristics of logical operations and expressions in formal languages.",

The kind of \"authority\" we're talking about here is authority *about* something - they have superior knowledge about that thing, aka, the most *expertise*.  \n\nAuthorities about something are supposed to be people (or organizations made up of people) who have expertise about that thing and who are recognized by other experts on that thing as having made a substantial contribution to the world's knowledge about that thing through reliable, high quality work involving that thing. In other words, they're the top experts on that topic. They're the ones who \"wrote the book\" on it, if you like. \n\nWhen experts disagree, they'll ask an authority for their opinion, and it holds a lot of weight in settling their dispute. If someone wants to convince people of some claim, appealing to an authority on whatever the claim is about is an excellent way to do it. Showing that the top experts on that topic make the same claim you're making gives a really good reason to believe your claim is true.\n\nBut, the whole thing falls apart if we appeal to the *wrong* experts when trying to give good reason to believe a claim. That's the fallacy of appeal to authority. \n\nA really obvious example of this would be saying something like, \"We should believe people who are poor are all lazy because all the top pastry chefs say so.\" The immediate, most rational response to that would be, \"So? What the fuck would pastry chefs know about it? What does being a pastry chef have to do with understanding the psychology of poor people or the causes of poverty?\" Pastry chefs and authorities on pastry cheffing don't have relevant expertise, so their opinion is irrelevant as far as settling our dispute is concerned.  \n\nBut, more often, it's not so obvious. People are getting fleeced all the time because someone with an MD tells them some fake or unproven medicine will cure them of some disease. People who aren't physicians rightly assume that someone with an MD has more expertise than they do when it comes to that disease. But, a lot of people don't realize that there is a difference between having an MD and being an expert authority on that disease. To them, a doctor is a doctor. \n\nOne way to avoid this kind of deception is to see what *doctors* say about that doctor. Does your GP say that doctor is an expert on that disease? Have they ever heard of him? Who would they ask if they had to figure out how to treat the disease? What sort of credentials would they look for? And so on.\n\nDid that help at all?",

Unless you\u2019re a damn scientist who can understand the evidence yourself, you have to, at some point, trust a scientist\u2019s authority and that they understand the data and have interpreted it correctly. And because the discipline is based on evidence, and because science is setup to incentivize competing authorities to challenge each other, you can trust that a scientific consensus is pretty solid and you can appeal to that consensus in an argument. It\u2019s equivalent to an appeal to facts and truth, but because you can\u2019t know it yourself, it amounts to an appeal to authority.\n\n\nUnless you know everything yourself and have the time and money to verify experiments yourself, you have to depend on an authority\u2019s expertise at some point. And my argument is science is the one system where that can actually be done somewhat safely (and appealed to in an argument).\n\nEdit: rereading your comment and I realize you missed my argument entirely. I\u2019m not saying scientists appeal to authority. I\u2019m saying regular people can appeal to scientists as an authority since it\u2019s designed to account for the problems with appealing to authority. In a way, because you\u2019re right that scientists themselves don\u2019t appeal to authority, they themselves can be the authority you appeal to.",

He, in fact, stumbled his way through mental gymnastics trying to denounce credible evidence without supplying any of his own to back his claims.\n\nRemember, just because everyone in this video speaks with a British accent does not make them intelligent.",

She bought into the Trump nonsense about conspiracies and over the course of a year, became MAGA. Then covid happened and because of my job, I was recieving medical updates and press releases, being in the audience of the first press conferences in the country. I told her straight up \"This is going to be bad, here's what you need to do-\" and was told that I was being a pawn of the liberal agenda to destabilize the Trump administration; like she went full nutter. Broke up with her, just washed my hands of that. Three months later, she got covid because she decided \"I'mma go to a covid party\", was laid up for weeks, with her mom dying from covid that she infected her with. Messaged her with my sympathies and was told her mom died from pneumonia, not covid but the big pharma has to inflate numbers on their fake virus. A year passes, she starts dating this other MAGA nutter, get engaged, get married at a big event and it's a super spreader, like four or five of her guests die. \n\nAs cruel as it sounds, I don't feel sad or scared, I don't even feel pitty.

I'd question how close any of the people you're talking about were to you, cause turning your back on people that are basically your family as easily and casually as you claim isn't the trait of a particularly nice person, in my opinion.",

The majority of their questions could likely be resolved, those that don\u2019t could lead to other questions, and maybe they\u2019d even find a point where there wasn\u2019t a good answer.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what these people do.

There is no control group either\n\nThe participation rate in vaers at times has been really low or really high depending on the prevalence of a disease.  For instance, in the swine flu outbreak it was very high (somewhere around 70%) due to the perceived importance of rereporting.\n\nThe anti-vaxx groups finds a study from a time of low reporting and then argues that because at time x there was only a 10% participation rate that it must mean that vaccine side effects currently being reported are under reported by a factor of 10.\n\nSo Vaers shows say 100,000 cases of myocarditis from the vaccine, they argue the true number must be 1 million.\n\nThe other thing they miss is that vaers doesn't ask for causation.  You know what else causes myocarditis?  Covid and a lot of the commorbidities associated with covid hospitalization.",

The concept of \"appeal to authority\" just refers to the fallacious rhetorical strategy of trying to convince someone of your argument based *only* on them acknowledging you as an authority. An example would be if a random guy wearing a lab coat were to make an argument and choose the back that argument up with, \"trust me, I'm a doctor.\" then *THAT* would be a fallacious argument. The argument may or may not be correct. And the guy may or may not actually be a doctor. But it's a bad argument regardless. \n\nHowever, if you are sitting across from someone whom you are fully aware actually **is** an expert in the subject at hand, and they choose to make their argument by *explaining why you are wrong* rather than just leaning on \"I'm an expert in this subject and you are not, and that means I must be right.\" then that is not remotely an \"appeal to authority.\" In fact, that's about as far removed from any logical fallacy I'm aware of as you can get. \n\nImagine being dead wrong about your own supposed field of expertise while you try to apply it to \"debate\" someone else in their own field of expertise. Absolutely humiliating. I'll never understand how dogmatic idiots keep getting platforms to try to ideologically bulldoze actual good faith actors that they happen to disagree with on a certain topic.",

You haven\u2019t provided any of their evidence. \n\nYou are literally taking a list of non-expert\u2019s words for it while dismissing the statements of actual experts and then claiming that those of us who actually listen to the evidence are the ones not listening. That is textbook cognitive DISSONANCE (fucking pathetic pedant).\n\nYour stance is the same because you refuse to actually listen to or accept evidence. \n\nWhat evidence have the experts \u201cflip flopped\u201d on? Wait wait wait, let me guess - someone at the beginning of the pandemic said you don\u2019t need to wear a mask so now every scientist in the world is stupid and doesn\u2019t know anything, right? \n\nDo you have the slightest idea how any of this works? As new evidence is presented, recommendations change. It is literally that simple. If there was evidence that the vaccines caused harm, recommendation would change. If there was evidence the vaccines did not work, recommendations would change. If there was evidence that masks didn\u2019t help, recommendations would change. If there was evidence the virus wasn\u2019t dangerous, recommendations would change. And guess what? As the pandemic has gone on, recommendations have changed based on the new evidence. That\u2019s not fucking \u201cflip-flopping\u201d you stupid ignorant fuck, that\u2019s exactly how science works. Just because you\u2019re too fucking stupid to understand the process doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not working or wrong. It just means you\u2019re fucking ignorant. \n\nYou have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. You are being conned by assholes who are taking advantage of morons. \n\nI am once again asking you to just. Fucking. Stop.",

What they did was merely extended upon. You can't say the people who work on and make mRNA suddenly don't get credit because some other guy did the research that allowed them to learn about it.

Not to mention all the ordinary Doctors, Nurses and Paramedics how are sceptical of the Covid vaccines but everyone out there think's they're wrong too.\n\n5 years ago if you spoke out against vaccines you were mocked for using 'facebook science' and thinking you know better than the experts. Now you have plenty of experts voicing their concerns about these new vaccines and all the ordinary people band together on social media to tell them they're wrong. It's the same logic FFS.",

MaCollough is a cardiologist, which, again, has nothing to do with expertise specifically regarding vaccines.\n\n99%+ of doctors are fully supportive of vaccinating.  Taking the less than 1% who object and saying we should listen to them, but ignore all the other 99% is flat out absurd.",

This technology (along with thousands of other medical technology advancements) made mRNA vaccines possible, but he wasn't involved in the research into how to use his technique in vaccines. \n\nAs far as I'm aware though, he hasn't even actually claimed that he invented mRNA vaccines.  I've listened to several of his interviews, and he talks about how he advanced the field of the use of mRNA in medical technology which would eventually make mRNA vaccines possible, but he doesn't actually say he invented mRNA vaccines - he just jumps straight into talking about vaccines like he has some kind of authority in that area, and people who are looking for anything they can use to criticize the covid vaccines about jump to the conclusion that he invented mRNA vaccines.  I haven't listened to every interview he's given though, so maybe he at some point started repeating the lies other people were telling about him, but either way, it's not true.",

That\u2019s just not how science works. You can always challenge every scientific study. That\u2019s what peer review is. And peer review never ends. That\u2019s why Eistein is still getting things right, wrong, and there are still people saying we should wait and see. Nobody just says \u201coh he\u2019s the guy who knows space he\u2019s right\u201d it\u2019s a new vaccine.

If it has not been peer reviewed don't believe them. If they say the science is settled laugh at them. If they believe themselves to be correct, tell them they are wrong. Science never stop.

The guy was being really respectful, and questioning the knowledge of people who are or seem very knowledgeable is quite important. I haven\u2019t seen the whole discussion but from this clip I can\u2019t really see what\u2019s the issue. Best case is the young man learned from the scientist. Questioning all truths is how we learn, it\u2019s how we grow. I disagree with people who will get offended or look down on others when they ask stupid questions. Don\u2019t you agree that our world can be sooo confusing? \n\nOne way or the other, I don\u2019t think you will be able to change peoples\u2019 minds by looking down on them. You will make them feel alienated and thus, push them further in the direction of conspiracies, misinformation, and non-compliance. So show some respect, show some compassion. Give people time and understanding. I know quite a lot of people who were reluctant to get the vaccine, and who were getting and believing a lot of misinformation. Trust me, they were laughed at and insulted, excluded and belittled. Many of them changed their mind and got vaccinated once they were met with compassion and understanding instead of ridicule and snobbishness. \n\n(yes I am vaccinated, yes I believe the scientist etc., that\u2019s not my point so don\u2019t come at me with that)",

Mostly Covid/anti-Covid stuff.  I'm very neutral about the whole pandamic.  I've been vaccinated 3 times, I wear my mask indoors, I social distance.  Whatever I'm being mandated to do, I'm just playing along.  I try to get my news from a variety of sources and I try to use my critical thinking skills when I'm listening or reading.  I don't argue with people about what they believe to be true, I don't push my views onto those around me.  But one commonality between these 2 co-workers and my former boss is the words \"I know, I've done my research!\" Is this something they're being told to say to people?  It's just odd these three people don't know each other but say those same 6 words.",

      "text": "He is correct. We do not rely solely on an appeal to authority. But we aren't being asked to.\n\nAn appeal to authority is FALLACIOUS if the main point of an argument rests on the authority of a person and nothing else, or the person is not an authority on the topic (rather an authority on a different topic, or a fraudulent expert), or the authority does not convey relevance to the point being made. It is a complaint directed at the process or method by which you arrived at the information, not a complaint against the validity of the information. We could have an expert with false information, and we could have a fraud with true information. It is only a warning that your information MAY be wrong. That your approach is not sound. Not that it actually is wrong.\n\nIf he wants to complain about an appeal to authority (not a fallacious one) that's fine, argue the points and facts being made by the authority. Just because the expert is an authority, does not make what the expert says true or untrue. It only makes it more likely to be true if the discussion is open to an audience since another expert could offer an alternative or expose a false statement. The only way to actually assess it is by evidence that supports it. If he makes this complaint about appeal to authority, he needs to demonstrate why it's a problem in this case. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with \"appeal to an authority\". We all do it all the time, when we call a plumber or an electrician or a doctor. A \"fallacious\" appeal to authority, on the other hand is a problem. If you call an electrician to explain how your kidney works and then claim it is true because your expert said so. The electrician could be right, but it is fallacious to say the REASON it is true is because he is an authority.\n\nIf we were to toss out the validity of what experts say, there would be no point in asking an expert what he thinks about a topic he knows alot about. Would he propose we pay no attention to experts at all? Resumes should be banned when applying for a job?\n\nBy labeling an argument as \"an appeal to authority\" only warns us that expertise is not the end all be all of an argument. We should be careful putting too much trust in an expert as a person, rather than evaluate the claims the expert makes. Not that we toss it out completely. But often this appeal is used to discredit entirely a valid expert opinion. This is especially the case in science when someone doesn't understand the science or just doesn't like the conclusions it reaches.",

To \"do your part\". While I agree that they never said it would 100% prevent you from acquiring or transmitting it, it was implied that it was an essential action to stop the spread, as it would make a huge difference.\n\nEverything we are learning now is that this was completely false. It makes a miniscule difference in terms of whether or not you acquire it, and makes no difference if you transmit it once you acquire it. It helps you not die if you acquire it.\n\nEveryone that was advocating taking the vaccine as a \"personal choice\" was correct, and everyone criticizing unvaccinated as \"plague rats\" was wrong.\n\nSo in terms of the authority figures and scientists being the ones to trust... there's a pretty clear example of being dead wrong.",

      "text": "Guess I disagree with everyone in this thread. I think the student definitely is wrong but he isn't being shown to be wrong here or treated fairly in my opinion. A lot of \"bad faith\" interpreting is going on there and even more so in the comments. I will also clarify my position so that I don't fall victim for the same bad faith. I am pro vaccines, have taken all 3 doses and think the positives far outweigh the negatives. I believe the negatives to be minor and rare for the vast majority of people.   \n\n\nI still think what we see in this clip is unfair. The student is clearly in a weaker position here. It is 2 against 1 and he seems to be just an audience member with a small chance to make his case against the expert and the leader of the television show. This has nothing to do with him being right or wrong I'm just saying it is a lot more difficult for him to make his case and he is clearly very nervous.\n\nHe doesn't say he studied philosophy to claim \"therefore I am right\" or to appeal to authority. He was anxiously trying to answer a question about the subject when she, instead of listening to his reasoning, interrupted and said who are you, that we should listen to, when we have a world renowned expert here? This was a clear appeal to authority instead of listening to his argument. He had already legitimized the doctor as an expert and showed both respect for that fact and the fact that he himself was not a doctor. But you don't need to be a doctor to know logical fallacies and indeed it seems you can even be a doctor and not know them.  \n\n\nI haven't seen the whole clip but it opens with the world renowned expert simply claiming this is fact and it is indisputable. Why is he on a debating show? What is the sole purpose of a debating show? To debate the facts. Which is indeed also what science is about. Science isn't the old vatican who just tell people the unquestionable truth directly from god and people are meant to just obey. Indisputable and science don't go together. This doesn't mean that things are not what they are but the pursuit of truth and science is eternal dispute.   \nAgain, I haven't seen the whole show so I don't know if the doctor shows the evidence and facts he has or not but in this clips he simply asserts it without proof. This is another logical fallacy. The student is well within reason to question it and he does have one of the sources of the doctors data which he claims is fallible and the doctors answer isn't no that data isn't fallible but that there is other sources of data as well. Which he also asserts and doesn't mention what it is.  So we only know one of his sources and that source is argued to be faulty to which he doesn't respond that it isn't but replies that he has more sources, leading us to believe that he might agree that it is faulty but he has more sources (which for all the know might also be faulty because there is zero mention to what they are at all).\n\nBy fallible data here I mean that it seems both parties agree that it is based on self-reporting. Self-reporting can mean under-reported but it can also mean over-reported. In any case it's not verified or black and white indisputable fact by any means.  \n\n\nLet's not give anti-vaxers more reason to think they are right by arguing in bad faith or just refusing to answer their claims by asserting \"the indisputable truth\", appealing to authority etc to confirm their conspiratorial thinking that we don't care actually care about the science and just want to \"silence\" them.",
