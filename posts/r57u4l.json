He also writes regularly for\u00a0anarcho-capitalist\u00a0websites and has self-published several books. Molyneux has a group of very ardent fans, even though he is only questionably an\u00a0ancap\u00a0at this point, and is hated by a large portion of them: he is a\u00a0\"racial realist\", and says disgusting\u00a0red-pill\u00a0things about women. He presents a\u00a0crank-magnetism\u00a0chimera of\u00a0men's rights,\u00a0white rights\u00a0and some sort of fedora-lover's\u00a0Glenn Beck (or a thinking man's\u00a0RooshV) who is known for\u00a0mistreating his guests.\n\nIn June 2020, Stefan's Youtube channel, which had 930,000 subscribers and 285 million views as of October 2019, was removed from the platform for hate speech. His Twitter account had more than 475,000 followers as of June 2020, but was suspended as of July 7, 2020.\"\n\nMore here: https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Stefan_Molyneux",

Especially if you\u2019re not bringing them on to challenge their views. This isn\u2019t Ben Shapiro or Kanye, stupid and backwards as their views may be at times. This is using your giant platform to give air time and promotion to a man who employs eugenics as a means of promoting scientific racism. And to give him air time and not challenging those views is just sprouting the seeds that will continue to grow into full on racism and white supremacy in the fertile minds of those already under its influence. And more people believe him than they do their doctor. Astounding.",

He was prescribed Ivermectin by a doctor and recieved it from a regular pharmacy/chemist/drug store. He also went through a heap of other expensive treatments as he seems to have freaked out and done everything within his considerable means to recover quickly. \n\nIt's pretty fucked up that few of his listeners could afford the health care he recieved,  yet he pretends it was all Ivermectin, despite knowing the Maga idiots and the antivaxxers (a chunk of his audience) were already shitting their pants due to self medicating with Ivermectin sourced from animal grade horse deworming medication. Similar to those that died drinking Hydroxychloroquine sourced from aquarium supplies.\n\nSo sure, fuck Joe Rogan, but let it be for the shit he has actually done.",
