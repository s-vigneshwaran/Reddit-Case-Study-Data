But still: Why would a 5'1 woman reject people for being shorter than 6'? That's quite a height difference right there",

But with the height difference between 5'1 and 6'3, many things would get awkward: Kissing while standing up would be borderline impossible, for example. My brother ist about 6'4, with a wife who is around 5'3, and a C-section was necessary for the baby because of how big it was. \n\nThis is why I don't understand why a 5' woman would *demand* a partner 6' or taller. Doesn't the woman in the screenshot know how tall 6'3 actually is in comparison to her height?",

Loving someone for their mind is cliche but generally it does last longer than your body. Obviously if it\u2019s a ONS, whatever, go for looks, but for an actual relationship, it\u2019s important to consider if your preference are yours or if they\u2019re just society\u2019s. My SO was bullied for being husky and still somehow thinks being built like a brick house is unappealing. Society can be ridiculous.",

There are more men for women to choose from, and fewer women to choose from, so for women it is a buyer's market. For men the supply is limited, so the cost for acquisition is higher. \n\nBesides, what we see is not all consciously processed. There is evidence and arguments that moral character is an important factor that is being evaluated: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844019366083\n\nBut at the end of the day, it comes down to the fact that attractiveness does play a role for both men and women. And attractiveness is relative depending on personal preferences and even age. https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/20/the-perfect-partner-how-age-affects-what-men-and-women-find-attractive",

And no hate against the individual member of that group, they didn\u2019t choose that things should be this way. But it\u2019s a fact that they are the most desired group, and most dating apps, nightclubs etc. use them as bait for getting their other customers money. I have worked as a bouncer for several nightclubs, and was literally instructed to ignore the anti-discrimination law, in order to uphold my quote for how many non young white women I was allowed to enter the nightclub that hour. And yes it was that hour, not that week, that night, no it was down to the specific hour.",

You ever meet someone you found attractive and find out they are shitty and they suddenly become super unattractive.\n\nMeeting people in less superficial environments helps a lot in this regard. I've met most of my ex gfs at school and charity events.\n\nSide note: try giving a girl a genuine compliment at a bar or something and then just walk away. Almost every time I've tried this the girl will later approach me and strike up conversation. (It can't be a creepy compliment, more like \"I like your dress\")",

Female is short for biological female, which is a term used when one doesn\u2019t wanna drag amab women into a discussion on some problematic issue centering around cis women and sometimes afab men. \n\nLike when talking about suicide rates for men and women it would be much more precise to use the terms men\u2019s suicide rate vs female suicide rates. Because amab women doesn\u2019t share the privileges of having so low suicide rate as other women. \n\nSame logic applies when talking about access to refugee shelters for domestic violence. Most shelters are not women only, but female only, since both cis women and afab men have access because they are perceived as being biological female while cis men and amab women are excluded because they are perceived as being biological male or more accurately because they\u2019re perceived as simply being men. \n\nMaking it problematic to use *female and men* is one of Reddit\u2019 many terfs\u2019 diabolical tricks to foster division between those of us perceived to be men, men and women alike.",

I did wonder whether you were including parental/filial love (or avuncular, or any other great Latinate words). \n\nAnd I totally agree: I would unscientifically wager that a big part of the issue with incels is that they are touch-starved, and affection-starved, rather than specifically sex-starved. I think they specifically fixate on sex even to the exclusion of those other things, and then are surprised when hiring a prostitute doesn't make them happy.\n\nI don't know why it is that they attach so much importance to _sex specifically_. I would personally - and again unscientifically - aver that society has a lot to answer for, with its emphasis on 'getting laid' as a rite of passage, and on the embarrassment of being a (male) virgin[0], and on the idea, through the conventions of marriage, that sex is the ultimate expression of love and commitment.\n\nBut people don't really want to acknowledge that, I think. Like with school shooters and serial killers and rapists, they would sooner believe that it's a purely personal issue with these people, which just happens to have sprung up ab ovo within this specific culture and within the last 10 or so years, much the same way serial killers were trendy late last century as highways grew faster than law enforcement cooperation and kids matured who had grown up with fathers back from - or _not_ back from - the wars. People generally seem to prefer great man theories, rather than acknowledging that we live in a complex system where blame and causality are matrices with countless elements beyond just the individual. Or that's my two cents, at least.\n\n[0] What does it say to young people that _The 40-Year-Old Virgin_ was a hilarious enough conceit to make a whole film about it? And waste a great treasure like Steve Carell on it too!",

Much appreciated.\n\n> on a causal/correlational-level view, men who were genetically predisposed to think that sex would fill that empty void in their hearts had more children than other men\n\nJesus, this is an absolutely fantastic explanation. I can't believe that dimension didn't cross my mind at all. I don't know if it's encoded in such concrete form as an *idea* - I'd guess it's more like \"evolution made us obsess over sex, and in our culture we give meaning to that by linking it to love\" - but I'm pretty sure you were speaking figuratively.\n\n> I do not consider the sum of my genes\u2019 value functions to be my own value function\n\nCeeertainly not. Didn't Richard Dawkins write something about shellfish jeans? My memory is hazy \ud83d\ude09 (And in any case, setting aside concerns about the unit of selection, even genuine evolutionary fitness is very different from happiness or flourishing as an individual, I agree.)\n\n> I do think society has a long way to go before it achieves a perspective that doesn\u2019t needlessly damage people, though.\n\nAbsolutely. I think a large part is that people need to be less influenced by 'society', and more bold in thinking for themselves. The challenging part is understanding *quite how much there is to discard*, quite how many ideas are deeply embedded in our brains - so deeply that we don't even recognise them as ideas we believe - which are not there because they're self-evident or are conclusions we've drawn, but because we've absorbed them - 'introjected' them - from our community. (I'm not even talking on the level of \"the earth is round\", but on the level of \"other people have minds and think the same way we do\" etc.)\n\nThere's a recent clich\u00e9 trend of programming blog posts - along the lines of \"X considered harmful\" - of \"falsehoods programmers believe about X\". I think we could do with a \"falsehoods [or even simply apocrypha / unprovenhoods] human beings believe about X\". I'd like to think we could all execute the Cartesian process of discarding all our beliefs and reassembling our mental model of the world from scratch - I think it would do us an enormous amount of good - but I'm not sure it's necessary for each of us on an individual level, so it might have to be a societal process.",

(The whole date was rather ridiculous, but my life is rather ridiculous, so it's just one more funny anecdote for me to tell at the pub.\\*)\n\nA few years later I was standing outside the pub having a cigarette, and I saw her walking by with some fellow. I thought to myself, \"Oh, there's that woman I had that weird date with. Man, that was crazy. Looks like she's with someone. Well, good for her.\" But then she saw me, and her reaction was to grab her boyfriend's hand and start swinging it while gazing into his eyes like she'd never been so in love. Which, again, is awesome. Yay for people in love! I love seeing it! I grew up in a dysfunctional family and it makes me happy to see happy, healthy families and relationships.\n\nExcept that it was so clearly a performance for my benefit, because right up until the moment she saw me they were just walking, side-by-side, no contact, eye, physical or otherwise.\\*\\* Just ridiculous. And to me, funny. Did she want me to think she was the one that got away? because that's not going to happen. I'm just not the kind of guy who could be hurt on a first date. So we're not a match. Big deal. That's what dating is for. Finding that out.\n\nBoth of those encounters really solidified the feeling that she was just interested in playing with people and trying to hurt them.\n\n\\*Nothing untoward happened on the date. We met at a bar that was familiar and safe and comfortable for both of us: I met her through a friend of mine who was her bandmate and DJ-ed there sometimes. She brought her friend, which I didn't expect but was fine with since I was looking for something that might be long-term so just hanging out and getting to know each other and people important to her was as good as a 1:1 date as far as I was concerned. But from the get-go she and her friend proceeded to utterly ignore and shut me out. Every time I tried to participate in the conversation they'd stare blankly at me and then turn to each other to reminisce about some event they shared years past. So I went outside for a cigarette and a break and responded to a text from a friend asking how my date was going, and I told him. Now, at the time my regular haunt was a different pub just across the street that was struggling, and most of the time the clientele was just my friend group, which included management. There was also a sort of riot/festival atmosphere due to Canadian city + Stanley Cup playoffs, so once the game of the evening was over, the bars would mostly empty out onto the street.\n\nSo, after hearing about my date from my friend, the manager decided to close up and she and everyone else came over to the bar where I was having my date. About 18 people walked in, by twos and threes, all saying hi to me as they passed our table, making it look like I just happened to be friends with everyone in the neighbourhood. (I had no hand in the planning of this, but I rolled with it. A couple of well-known local actors I was acquainted with also happened to walk in and say hi as well, which only added to the effect.) After the contest of friends\u2014her 1 to my 1\u00bd dozen\u2014I politely thanked the women for the conversation and excused myself to go spend the rest of the evening with my friends. That was it.\n\n\\*\\*I considered that maybe I'd done something during the date to make her uneasy, since I'm a largish man, a bit neurodivergent (so my stories are all slightly weird, even when I'm not talking about the shiny thing I saw on the sidewalk on the way over), who talks rather openly, animatedly, and quickly. Most people, including women, feel pretty comfortable and relaxed around me, but of course my personality isn't to everyone's taste. So that might have been her motivation for her show of romantic exuberance with another man years later, and I'm not going to fault anyone for being cautious when it comes to their physical security. But I don't think that was it. And when I told our mutual friend, the DJ, about the date and the aftermath, he sort of rolled his eyes and said, \"Yeah, that's pretty much how she does.\" And we laughed. As us LVM are wont to do when dealing with ridiculous people wrapped up in an endless search for external validation. We just don't know how bad we have it.",

They're bitter because they don't have the same natural sex appeal as they did in their 20s and feel like they should demand the very best of the best in sexual partners while bringing nothing of value themselves to the table.\n\nI think it's also a defence mechanism. If they set their standards absurdly high they'll either meet them (highly unlikely) or feel good about themselves for rejecting men that don't live up to their unrealistic expectations.\n\nfor example doing [the 6-6-6 requirements for males](http://www.iwonderifyouareoutthere.com/man.html) in the US (6 foot tall, 6 figure income, 6 inch dick) you're looking at only 1870 men in the entire US between the ages of 19-35 years old (0.0005787% of the population.)",

I would wager that 99% of the flamewars would not happen if both sides replaced the term with a plain English statement of what they mean by it[0].\n\n[0] On the left: \"an abstruse legal studies philosophy scrutinising the impact of racist bias on the drafting of superficially non-racist laws, e.g. crack cocaine sentencing disparities\".

They almost play the victim.\n\nHowever people like to just use it as a blanket insult alot, and it kinda loses its meaning.\n\nBTW I might be wrong, internet likes to screw around with definitions and this is just what I've observed and what I know.",

Would you consider that this discussion has raised some strong feelings in you and that might be impacting how you're interpreting what I say?\n\nMen and women are conditioned to believe that we should value certain things when we are growing up. We might find ourselves seeking out things because we are told we're supposed to value them. Often, as we mature, we find that what society tells us we should want doesn't necessarily align with what we want. \n\nIn some cases, people likely steer away from choices that differ from the norm because they fear judgement. Again, this is something you get past at a certain point. \n\nIn short, part of the reason dating is such a minefield in your 20s is that most often you haven't really grown into your true self yet. You're still figuring out who you want to be, and that's OK. Unfortunately, both you and your peers will feel beholden to ideas and standards that may not fit who you really are. You'll have insecurities but not the emotional wherewithal to handle them in a productive way. Again, completely ok. The job as you grow is to develop emotional intelligence and become comfortable with yourself and your relationships with others.",

She needs this validation because she's insecure, and having it denied is a blow to her ego integrity.

So I do still consider people I don\u2019t really find attractive.\n\nI always take a long time in profiles because it doesn\u2019t matter how attracted I am to them, if they\u2019re religious, we\u2019re not remotely politically aligned, they don\u2019t like animals, they don\u2019t seem to have a sense of humor, their grammar is atrocious, they seem arrogant, or they seem boring or barely write anything about themselves at all, then it\u2019s not going to work (or is otherwise unlikely to and not worth the time to find out).\n\nMeanwhile, at a bar, in person, it\u2019s really difficult for me to find out those sort of things as quickly, so I feel like my standards for physical attraction go up way higher since it\u2019s one of the only things I can initially go on relative to reading a profile.\n\n\u2026.which seems like the total opposite of what you\u2019re saying, lol. Am I just completely out of touch here?\n\nAlso, every time I\u2019ve done online dating, I basically don\u2019t put a picture of myself. Just one picture of the back of my head. You cannot discern my race, face, breast size, weight, body shape, nothing.\n\nI do that because in my first experience of putting a relatively modest photo of myself, I was overwhelmed by messages in which 99/100 were creepy, low effort, or only commented on my looks.\n\nBut even with essentially no picture, my profile is always suuuuuper popular because of what I have written down. I almost get the same amount of messages as before, but they are much higher quality.\n\nI would think people would be constantly skipping over me if they were so focused on physical attributes and being more selective physically?",

But all these posts showing people screening based on physical characteristics (e.g. height) back that up. \n\nYou\u2019re right though, and maybe I should amend what I\u2019m saying to it allows people to be pickier in general. You personally focus your selectivity on things that you\u2019ve learned are important to your long-term prospects with someone. Not everyone has the goal of a long-term successful relationship, and not everyone has the emotional maturity to understand and screen for what\u2019s important to make that work. So instead of swiping based on that criteria, they screen people based on physical characteristics.\n\nSo no, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re out of touch, I just think you have different priorities and/or are more emotionally mature than the people my original comment was about.",

What it seems like is that you\u2019re projecting that fact that *you* wouldn\u2019t have this height requirement, and therefore don\u2019t think he would either. \n\nIt\u2019s also a really reasonable height requirement, he\u2019s not asking for anything crazy. 5\u20191 is pretty short for even an average height guy, it\u2019s crazy short for a guy like him. He may not have it on his bio, because he probably wouldn\u2019t need it, seeing as most people aren\u2019t as short as her.",

And he just shits on her physicality and puts her down and makes her feel like crap about herself. \n\nAmazing.",

He messaged her. She wanted to talk about how he was hot - right away - he got upset and considered that an insult because he was trying to say something else. \n\nSo , out of his being upset he decided to find something about her physically he could diss her for and ditch her over. He did this. She got very mad he did that because she was being nothing but complimentary to him and trying to call him sexy and she was hurt by the fact he decided not to reciprocate.\n\nthat's all that this is. \n\nneither one of them is particularly monstrous or insane. He wanted to talk about books and shit, she wanted to talk about his body and his hotness, he got insulted, so he insulted her, and they both left sadder. \n\nthe end.",

He  said \u201ctoo much of a height difference\u201d, which very specifically *avoids* placing the blame on her/her body.\n\nHe only got more specific than that after she went all Karen by being offended over *his* height preference and going all \u201cthe audacity!\u201d on him - and even then, he didn\u2019t say anything harsh. He wasn\u2019t like \u201cyou\u2019re too short\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t date short girls\u201d. All he said was \u201cI have preferences just like you\u201d.\n\nThen she goes straight to insulting him, physically (and what\u2019s widely considered to be the most harsh insult for men\u2019s bodies) and otherwise (incel, also an unnecessarily harsh insult and he is quite literally the exact opposite of that in the situation). \n\nAnd this is what you\u2019re defending?! Seriously?!\n\nYou have absolutely no regard for what he wants in this. \n\nShe only wants to smash, cool. Was it in her profile?\n\nIf it was, OP can not like just jumping into things and decide they aren\u2019t a good fit.\n\nIf it wasn\u2019t and OP was looking for something more serious, he can politely nope out once he realizes she doesn\u2019t want the same thing as him.\n\nRather than say \u201cwell, you\u2019re being rude, grossly objectifying me, and clearly we\u2019re not on the same page, so I\u2019m going to bounce\u201d he instead chose the nice way out and chalked it up to an incompatibility in preferences and height which specifically doesn\u2019t place blame on either party.\n\nThere is only ***one person*** who hurled insults - *multiple* insults - in that conversation - and it wasn\u2019t OP.\n\nOP is allowed to want a conversation before getting to the sexual stuff. OP is allowed to want something more serious. OP is allowed to expect he won\u2019t be straight up ignored first thing. OP is allowed to not want his height fetishized. OP is allowed to prefer someone taller. **OP is allowed to decide they are incompatible for any number of reasons and honestly and politely let her down without expecting to be insulted and attacked for not automatically participating in her creepy daddy-daughter height fantasy.**",

But that was just taller, not a specific height requirement.  For example a 5\u20196\u201d woman would prefer a man who was 5\u20197\u201d or taller.  Over time that preference grew to include being taller than her when she wears high heels.  But again, that preference was nominally based on suitable dance partners.\n\nYet somehow in the last 30 years that has morphed into specific height requirements (like 6\u20190\u201d or taller) regardless of the woman\u2019s height, and is not based on anything but, as you say, superficial standards.  There is no logical reason a 5\u20191\u201d woman should require her partner to be over 6\u20190\u201d except for superficial reasons.",

Although these interactions may be born out of superficiality I believe the deeper goal is materialistic as the long term idea is to parade your boyfriend or girlfriend around like some prize you won.

As time goes by it gets dirty, it breaks down and ultimately you get rid of it to find something new.",

This \u261d\ud83c\udffb\n\nI once had a guy send a dick pic with his dick next to a coke can for scale.\n\nNormally I\u2019d be seriously fucking annoyed since it was unsolicited, but in the photo his dick looked fucking MASSIVE. I\u2019m a sex worker, so I\u2019ve seen a few, and this looked easily to be the biggest dick I\u2019d ever seen.\n\nI was like \u201choly shit, you could make serious bank doing porn\u201d because dude obviously had something special (not necessarily \u201cbetter,\u201d but rare and niche enough to do well in porn for a male SW).\n\nHe laughed and immediately admitted it was a camera angle + prop (coke can) trick, and that his dick wasn\u2019t actually very big at all.\n\nI was pretty skeptical that a camera angle could make *that* much of a difference (it honestly looked 12\u201d so even being a few inches smaller would still be a massive wang) so then he sent another (this time solicited) picture better showing it\u2019s actual size - which was, in fact, perfectly average. \n\nThis guy lived across the country from me, so he explained, in jest, that he sent the first picture since he knew I\u2019d never actually see it in real life.\n\nTo be honest, I was pretty impressed with his candor and honesty and good attitude about it all. He quickly apologized for the unsolicited dick pic and actually ended up being pretty cool. We became perfectly platonic long distance buds for a while after that.\n\nAnyway, point being, you\u2019re absolutely right. \n\nI\u2019m not a size queen (average is good for a reason and I\u2019ve had lots of fun with smaller than average dicks too, plus I\u2019m a firm believer that genital compatibility is a thing), but now I *definitely* don\u2019t trust dick pics - even when *attempting* to show it to scale - to be any better at accurately representing a dudes size than the standard \u201cI have an 8\u201d cock\u201d that so many guys always like to claim (why is it always 8 inches??? Do they not realize how rare that is, and thus how obvious AF it is that it\u2019s not at all true once in person?)",

Maybe even more than they talk about their own dicks.\n\nSo I\u2019m genuinely wondering if women perhaps act differently in het dynamics by talking about their breast size unprompted like dudes talk about their dick size?",

I feel like that\u2019s not a great example.\n\nI would say most heterosexual men prefer women shorter than them and vice versa, and she is definitely taller than the average woman, so it makes more sense to make all of that known.\n\nShe\u2019s not even ridiculous with her request, since she would date someone the same height as her. She just doesn\u2019t want to be the taller partner.\n\nMost women 5\u20196\u201d or 5\u20197\u201d and under (who prefer to be the shorter partner) never have to even think to put it in their profiles since most men are taller than them by default.\n\nLikewise, most guys 5\u20198\u201d and up who prefer to be the taller partner never have to think to put a height requirement in their profile either, since they will typically be taller than most women already.\n\nI think this is different than a woman who is average or shorter than average having a requirement for someone ridiculously taller, like 5\u201910\u201d+.\n\nI\u2019m 5\u2019, and while I don\u2019t see a lot of men\u2019s profiles with some super short height requirement, I\u2019ve had *plenty* tell me they \u201conly date short girls\u201d - not short*er*, but short. Even if they are already 6\u2019+.\n\n*Those* type of height requirements are where things get pretty shallow and weird to me.\n\n(For what it\u2019s worth, I think the social expectation of men needing to be taller than their female partners in straight relationships is also bullshit, but it\u2019s at least understandable where people are coming from with that due to social conditioning and biology naturally making that the most common scenario anyway).",

I've met guys who will basically not look at anyone over 110lbs. That's *undeniably* shallow behavior.\n\nIf someone is saying they won't date someone because they're obese and unhealthy, that's way more defensible. It speaks to lifestyle and priority differences.

As in, if a woman\u2019s photos are consistently from certain angles or close up, most people would be suspicious.\n\nYou can either decide to chance it, decide to pass, or request more photos. \n\nI date women too, and I\u2019ve had times where I\u2019ve had to ask someone to \u201cshow me what outfit they\u2019re wearing\u201d by taking a picture in the mirror to get a better idea of what they actually looked like since all their other photos seemed like they could easily be misrepresenting themselves. If they don\u2019t do that or continually put it off, then I move on unless there\u2019s a exceptional connection that makes it worth meeting up to see if there\u2019s any physical attraction there too.\n\nMy point being, most women\u2019s photos will show a roughly accurate representation of their breast size and body weight, and it\u2019s fairly easy to find out for those who lose photos are questionable.\n\nEither way, it doesn\u2019t necessitate a guy writing a requirement for breast size or weight in their profile 90% of the time.\n\nIn contrast, you can\u2019t really get a good idea of someone\u2019s height from pictures ever.\n\nSo if you have a preference - especially a preference for someone being much taller or shorter than average - then it makes sense to include that in your profile. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen guys specify a certain height, but I have seen plenty of \u201cshort girls only\u201d or \u201cI prefer short girls\u201d.",

If one is bad, the other is also obviously bad.\n\nI don't think preferences are bad at all. They're a natural consequence of dating, I think, although they should remain *preferences* and not hard and fast rules if for the sole reason that you're filtering out really cool people you may otherwise really be attracted to.\n\nIt's why I'd never advertised my preferences while dating, because I didn't want anyone looking at my profile to feel filtered out and as a consequence I ended up marrying someone who is far from what I'd describe as my preference, but whom I love dearly.",

The social rules they follow and think the world operates by is so different from any normal logic. Any criticism against a woman is the worst thing ever but men are open field to tear down as much as they want. \n\nLet\u2019s face it, for most women it\u2019s not a preference for height - it\u2019s a standard. Your height isn\u2019t a quality of yours, it\u2019s your social currency and if you\u2019re short as a man you have social poverty.",

Normal people just think both groups are terrible. \n\nIt's entirely plausible for women to hold maladaptive views on relationships and to seek other like-minded women to form a community. \n\nYou're going to great lengths to imagine a scenario to justify *your* preconceived biases and create a simpler worldview with a clear antagonist.

Like even if u use the metric system it doesn\u2019t really matter. U know the dude is over 6 feet. That\u2019s \u201ctall\u201d. Then the rest is just subtracting super small numbers that aren\u2019t even decimals. Like subtract 3 from 5. That\u2019s 2. So u just picture 2 out of 5 to visualize the difference. \n\nIts just simple math that everyone just basically does it instantly. It\u2019s easy to picture 2 fifths of something or even 1 1/3 compared to 6. No need to convert anything and u can just instantly visualize the difference in rhe people without even knowing what they are exactly in metric. It\u2019s just basic subtraction and being able to visualize fractions. \n\nMaybe u were just so tired u were thinking about the problem weirdly but this is the method I do when I see things like this in metric. W problems like this in metric I don\u2019t convert anything yet I\u2019m still able to understand the difference. Hopefully u can do this in the future if u haven\u2019t been doing this.",

I worked in a group home with lots of pretty/handsome teens who, life-wise, had it bad from every angle. Of course, there were some that weren\u2019t blessed with looks that \u201cdo the work\u201d of getting people to introduce themselves. \n\nI also worked there because they had problems I had growing up, I just wasn\u2019t out in the system because my parents had some minor social standing that prevented it. I was pretty, I was in school, I looked fine. I was definitely, definitely not fine. \n\nI\u2019ve learned a couple of things in my 40s. One, therapy really does help. The older you get, the more likely you may be to separate who you are now from what was done to you as a child. Not easy, but distance helps. Two, with a job and a bit of cash you get to make your own choices and rules. Having options really helps people with insecure childhoods feel safer. Three, ten years from now you\u2019ll look at a picture of yourself and think, \u201cman, I looked good then.\u201d That\u2019s just true for many people. Don\u2019t waste the pretty/handsome! That doesn\u2019t have anything to do with meeting a partner. Wear clothes you like, makeup/hats/hair that\u2019s fun, go to movies feeling glamorous, whatever it is that makes you feel pretty/handsome. Because you are. And that\u2019s separate from being in a relationship or being a child. You can be pretty/handsome just for you. \n\nFinally, I didn\u2019t meet my husband until I had been single for many years. Later in life weddings are the best, because it\u2019s not your obnoxious, pretentious Perfect Pretty Princess Day, it\u2019s *Our* Thank God We Met a Functional Adult We Like Party, and it is awesome. \n\nWhatever is to come, I hope you someday can know in your bones that we were not ugly or bad or awful or a woman hater or too sick/fucked up/crazy. We got dealt a bad hand, but that\u2019s not our fault. \n\nI wish you peace and healing in the new year.",

To be able to be allowed to use a story as a script the director has to promise to keep the setting, not the theme for the story. Setting being a Christmas party. Not because it is Christmas but because of its normal to gather like that at work for a celebration.\n\nPlease don\u2019t perpetuate this shit without understanding the joke because then it\u2019s only you who become the joke!",

They realise no-one in their right mind would ever recognise them as a worthy specimen of the human race and therefore play pretend, utilising the very thing that people hate about them to make themselves feel better, their idiocy. No, it's worse than being an idiot, they are the epitome of human selfishness, entitlement and prejudice. The ones that are basically female counterparts for incels. Only they can have preference, only they can pick and choose. Because those horrendous, thick skulled apes believe they are entitled to it all, that they are the exception. They are the lowest of the low, the arrogant and yet ignorant beings that bring down the entire species of humans. I would say they are brainwashed but I'm not sure there is anything to wash. those cerebrally incompetent, IQ of a brick, bags of meat that not even the maggots of this Earth would dare attempt to approach.

One is only natural, the other is shitty behaviour.\n\nWhereas dating based on someone's material wealth is just really self centred, and putting the worth of a person in their wallets is wrong. Of course, there can be a lower limit, most people don't want to really want to be the partner of someone up to their necks in debt, or with no source of income, but that lower limit should end at the point that self sustainability starts, because after that you're just judging whether someone is \"worthy\" of you based on their level of luxury, or how rich their parents were.

There are strong trends in what a person finds attractive, and psychological studies show that a lot of these factors are basically imprinted into a person's mind from early age. \n\nBeyond a certain point though, things come down to personal preferences. Key word, *preference*. Having preferences is OK, and not unhealthy, but making these preferences criteria is wrong. The woman in the post above having a criteria of 6ft is wrong. A preference is something someone should be willing to let go off if they are willing to pursue a relationship. It's not like most women who find beards sexy will say: If you don't grow a beard, I will never date you.\n\nMost preferences are either social constructs (which IMO is wrong, things like tiny waist and big hips, because it pushes a body image into people who naturally cannot achieve those proportions, which is unhealthy psychologically and physically in some cases), or aesthetic choices, which, once again, is perfectly natural and normal.\n\nThe thing about money though, there is no factor beyond laziness or greed that would push people to only date people who have a large disposable income but shrug off anyone who is making ends meet but not much more.\n\nAlso, your last statement isn't what I was saying. Remember, finding someone physically attractive is a monkey-brain natural thing, it's human nature, but placing someone's worth on their looks is judging them, which I said is wrong to do. There is nothing monkey-brained about looking at a person's net worth and creating a mental image for yourself about how you can enjoy their lifestyle, and such, you are instantly being judgemental if you do so, which is wrong.",

If you already do define your relationship as transactional, not unlike prostitution, nobody hates that, hell most south asian cultures still follow arranged marriage where a woman's partner are chosen by her parents based on how financially secure the guy is and the groom decides if the girl is pretty enough for him. What FDS people want is literally a relationship and relationships are not transactional, there's no \"I got you a gift so now I deserve a blowjob\", relationship is based around love and not material things \n\nAnd what do I mean by attractive women? Idk? women who look good and/or are successful, good looking people don't generally have that many problems dating and hence have literally no reason to spend time on subreddits made around dating, and like you said women should be pretty if they want a rich man, I don't think majority of women who use FDS are really that good looking",

He feels that he is just too ugly/unpleasant/awkward to ever get a beautiful woman to have sex with him or be in a relationship. He is angry at the world because he was born this way. It's not his fault he is ugly/awkward. \n\nI've talked to self-described incels before and asked \"why don't you just stop trying to hook up with the hottest girl and maybe settle for an average looking girl?\" And they respond that they don't want an average girl. They don't want to settle for having sex with someone they don't find attractive. They want a hot girl, and because they were born ugly, they'll never get one, and they even understand why the hot girls don't want them; they're ugly and awkward. Why would a hot girl want that?\n\nThey generally categorize men in 3 groups: incels, normies (\"Norman\") and Chads.\n\nChads are handsome, fit, charming men who get all the hot girls. These are the men all women wish they had (because according to them, all women are shallow and only after Chads). \n\nNormies, or Normans, are the middle of the road guy. Average. Not ugly, but not a Chad. Normies get plenty of average women, and Normies are too stupid to realize they're not actually what women want; women want Chad. They might settle for a Norman if they can't get Chad, but make no mistake, every time a Norman has sex with a woman, she is thinking about a Chad.\n\nAnd then there's incels, the bottom. The ones who understand they are gross and awkward and no one will ever want them.\n\nThey hate the world, and they really hate beautiful women. They don't hate Chads because Chad is living the life they wish they had. They don't hate Normans, but they pity Norman and look down on him for being stupid enough to play the game.\n\nBut they really hate women, especially beautiful women.\n\nEdit: the female version of an Incel is sometimes called a \"Femcel\".",

I have super low standards and I'll have sex with dang near any woman, but I suppose I'm not attracted to, let's say, 87 year old women. What would my life feel like if the only women who wanted me were 87yo nursing home patients? How would I feel about the world if all the 3-10s wouldn't give me the time of day, and I had to settle for women I didn't want?\n\nI suppose that's the issue. They need to understand that:\n\n1. No one is entitled to sex or love from anyone so you may never hook up with a 10/10, and that's okay, and\n\n2. There are plenty of women you'd probably like, and they'd have sex with you and love you, if you changed your attitude (so you wouldn't have to settle for a 2/10).\n\nI mean, I see plenty of non-Chad guys with gorgeous women all the time. I've seen hideous, short, overweight dudes going to dinner with model looking women.",

That said it's not really hard to find similar and more real reactions. \n\nOn tiktok I saw some girl get turned down by a guy she wanted to make out with at a party. He was really nice about letting her down. Not overly nice, just made it clear he wasn't into her and was talking to other people at the party. \n\nAs soon as the dude leaves she starts shit talking him. Calling him awkward/creepy, and insinuating things. \n\nGranted she was on some shitty college 'let's see who we can get to make out' show it seemed. So I get she was embarrassed. But it's not exactly uncommon. \n\nI get the frustration some dudes feel. Any preferences men have is quickly made out to be \"you're an asshole\" situation. People imply you're an incel or gay way too fast. Many times it seems it's fine to think that way too.",

              "text": "I was raised by women. My grandmother and my great grandmother raised me. So, needless to say, I come from a different time.\n\nThat said, I think most of the people who comment on Reddit in general are the kind of people you wouldn't want to associate with. No offense to those people. I think everyone should live their lives and deal with their decisions. If a man decides to treat women like shit, then he is deciding to suffer himself. That's not for me to judge. He will die alone and unhappy, so he has enough trouble to worry about without me judging him. Personally, I cut those people out of my life because it doesn't line up with my personality. Most decent people do, hence the alone and unhappy part.\n\nI think the worst among us are the most vocal. It just is that way, because the best among us are likely very concerned about the impression they leave behind while the worst just don't care.\n\nI also think it takes both kinds. Without the dark, you wouldn't appreciate the light. If we were all upstanding, decent people, then the world would just be bland and comfortable; unchallenging.\n\nSo, we're left with knowing there's nothing we can do about it. We just have to live in this state. How do we help *ourselves* if that's the case. I had a conversation with a person in this same thread, I think, where I talked about filters. I have filters set up in my life that I rely on to remove people from my life. If a person finds themselves in one of those filters, it's because they've done some questionable shit. Sometimes I free them from that filter and let them carry on in my life. Sometimes I just leave them there and we disconnect over time. The point is that they found themselves in the filter, so they are responsible for finding a way out. \n\nIn this respect, finding people with basic mutual respect is easy, because the only people who find themselves beyond all my filters and close to me have the values that are important to me.\n\nI'm not rude about it. I'm not disrespectful. I don't tell them they've found themselves in a filter. I just disconnect. It saves me the headache and most people are perfectly happy just moving on. Occasionally, though, you get people who never hit a filter or people who question why you're disconnecting. These are indicators that the person you're involved with is decent in some way. Maybe a misunderstanding got them in a filter. Maybe they made a mistake they really do regret. Either way, if they want out of a filter, I give them a chance because maybe they're a best friend for a few decades or maybe they're a good partner, etc.\n\nThe result of this is that I have like 2 best friends. I have maybe 10 close friends. And I have hundreds of acquaintances. But you don't get to those places in my life unless you are decent enough to get beyond the filters. Yeah, I wish I had all the best friends to count on, but why accept people into my life if it's just going to be stressful for me?",

It's that they know a vast swath of society doesn't like X behavior they're presenting and *they just don't care*.\n\nThere's a major difference between that and what has happened here. I see this regularly enough that I've thought about it. One guy in a similar post said \"how much do you weigh\" when asked how tall he was. Lady got angry. Guy made the point that it's much easier to lose weight than it is to *gain height*.\n\nSo, I think what's happening here is wholesome.\n\nMy s/o pointed out that women want to wear heels and men typically don't like it when the woman is taller than them.\n\nSo we've found ourselves in a world where, for the last several decades, men have been asking women inappropriately how much they weigh. Now women are inappropriately asking men how tall they are.\n\nAt the end of the day, the whole thing is a vicious cycle. So, I'm happy when I see both sides get checked. Men shouldn't be degrading women when they aren't this tiny little thing that has to starve to live up to some idea of what men or society want them to be and women shouldn't be demanding men be taller than they are physically incapable of being. Yes, have preferences. No, don't call people names when you get checked on asking inappropriate questions.\n\nI think both sides need to lower some of these insane expectations. I'm 100% confident that women are missing out on good relationships because they want tall men and I'm 100% confident men are missing out on good relationships because they want skinny women. I think everyone needs to remember that we aren't looking for physical perfection. We're looking for laughter till we cry or someone you *love* spending all your time with or someone who truly gets you. The physical side is finite. It always degrades. The mental and emotional side isn't. It's what lasts forever.\n\nSo, no, I can't associate this with politics because what the alt right is doing is called gaslighting. What men and women are doing to themselves isn't gaslighting, it's more akin to masochism.",

Especially in unexpected ways such as the \u201c?\u201d representing an upward lilt in tone that we naturally use at the end of sentences sometimes. I think this originated on tumblr but if anyone knows more, feel free to correct me :)\n\nNot sure if this was the intention of the commenter, but it seems possible. If this is something they just naturally started doing, it\u2019s possible that\u2019s why they had difficulty explaining what they were attempting to do. It\u2019s also possible that this wasn\u2019t their intention lol, in that case it\u2019s at least an interesting fact",

It is definitely a double standard in this case because she does specifically state that she wants only men 6 feet and above. It's OK that he doesn't want to date someone short. It's his preference. He was not rude to her. He was not degrading or misogynistic at all. He is not an incel. That word is thrown around a little too loosely in my opinion. Having preferences for dating on all sides is not a bad thing. Like I said, you're attracted to what you're attracted to. He dodged a bullet here.",

I also mentioned that no one should feel entitled to a partner with certain physical attributes, especially if one doesn't have the attributes the other person is looking for.\n\nThen his brilliant dad explained that while we all have our preferences for external appearance, it's very likely that one day you will meet someone who isn't at all our \"type\" and find yourself totally attracted or in love with them because what really counts is what's in the heart and the mind. \n\nIt was a beautiful teaching moment about not being so shallow.",

      "text": "EWWW.. I have a few things. First: I don\u2019t understand why so many women seem to have such a hard on for super tall dudes. I mean I\u2019m 5\u20191\u201d like this girl is and I don\u2019t want to have to step on my tippy toes, a step ladder or be picked up to kissed while standing up. I want to be relatively the same height as my partner so even if it\u2019s just when we are holding hands, I\u2019m not being pulled up like a toddler lol. I can\u2019t imagine the discomfort of tall men who have to fold themselves in half to kiss or hug their partner. Your back is probably fucked up already from the normal wear and tear, but being with really short women must really speed up the chronic back pain. \n\nSecond: we ALL have preferences whether we follow them or state them out loud or not. OP Is well within his rights to think \u201cnah, the logistics won\u2019t work for me\u201d without being berated. I think while we\u2019ve made good strides in terms of inclusivity and whatnot, but everyone has our basic fundamental things that make someone attractive to us and that\u2019s okay. I like girls for our femininity (girl parts and all) and while some may scream that I\u2019m transphobic, I personally would not date/have sex with a trans woman who has not had gender confirmation surgery. I just am not attracted to penises or masculine features but it\u2019s not a matter of I don\u2019t think trans women are women, I just am only attracted to breasts, curves, soft plump lips and vaginas. Anyways, I\u2019m probably getting off track but we are allowed to have height preferences, gender preferences, job preferences (if one person is career motivated and the other is not, it can cause a lot of problems) etc; without being prejudiced or an asshole.\n\nLastly, isn\u2019t it hilarious how she seemed really into OP until he rejected her and then she insulted him and called HIM a incel when she literally made a textbook incel move??! Is there a coined name for girl incels or do we also call them incels?",

Just in the same sense that there are a lot of advantages to being male as well as a lot of other unfair disadvantages. Equality doesn't exist in today's age unfortunately no matter what gender you're looking at, but that doesn't mean it can't be something that we as people still strive for.\n\n  \n\n\n\"What feminist want, by definition, is female supremacy\" - This is wildly inaccurate, if that's true then why is the actual definition of feminism (as according to Google) \"The advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.\"? Sure you may have meet \"feminists\" that seem that way (being a \"supremacist\" as you said), but that's not what feminism really is BY DEFINITION, that's something else entirely. You can nitpick and say \"well they say they're feminist and they hate men, so they must all be like that!\" but you're just generalizing an entire movement at that point. That's like if you were to look at the Westboro Baptist Church and say \"man, these people are very hate-filled and terrible people in general, all Christians must be this way!\". It's inaccurate and you're just nitpick experiences/a radical few to fit your agenda.\n\n  \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, both genders have their own set of problems they face in life, but that's why things like feminism exists, to try and bring EQUALITY between the sexes. In your first comment you said you can't take women seriously, maybe if you treated the opposite gender as equals women would take you seriously too.",

I did my best, and it was like watching a train crash in slow motion coming to the realization that I'd never at least be 5'10. \n\nIt caused a lot of anxiety and depression in my younger years. I tried online dating because I was a huge introvert at the start of my adult years. (I'm 32 now). Because of this, I took it so literally that women only want taller guys that I never even bothered to ask somebody out in real life until my late 20s. I didn't even have my first girlfriend until I was 27, and she made me realize my value.\n\nI'm 32 now, single, and I got out of another relationship that was just not healthy recently.

Heck, give me someone 5\u20195 and I\u2019m happy! \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like I\u2019d refuse to date someone shorter either, if they were really fun to be around. I may feel like an insecure 5\u20193.5 giant because I have issues, but it doesn\u2019t ruin anything fundemental.\n\nI mean, preferences are fine. If I was building my perfect partner they would probably be between 5\u201910 and 6\u20195. But height has become the new (or second alongside it) weight. There\u2019s extremes on both ends, and weight obviously varies more and has more health implications while height is largely (but not completely) shallower, but the same applies. A slightly overweight woman is just as good a partner as a slightly shorter man, and yet people blow it out of proportion. A 5\u20192 women refusing to date a 5\u20195 man is just as ridiculous as a 175lb man refusing to date a 190lb woman.",

I dated a 6'4 guy who was *very* into the size difference and it really wore on me. It's funny- he loved it, but I hated how small I felt with him. If we were playing build-a-boyfriend I'd want someone who was maybe 5'3-5'4 so I can put heels on and feel like a supermodel lol. There's so much more to a man than his height, so I wouldn't turn down someone my ex's height purely for that... but yeah, if we're talking preferences, I'll take the short to average guys please.\n\nI totally agree that it's blown out of proportion. Not only is it pretty shallow, but 6'0 feels like such an arbitrary height too. Like, what functional difference is there between 5'10 and 6'0? I doubt most women my height would even be able to tell the difference. You're pretty much fetishizing a number at that point.",

Prior to the set up, the lady to whom I was paired had requisites and one in particular was I had to have washboard abs. The owner instructed my co-workers to stare relentlessly at my abs. I was discombobulated on how unprofessional on the whole criteria. I eventually left the company and the owner stated he would give me a letter of commendation probably for all the bullshit I had endured.\n\nI was attending college at the time.  While there was a pause, it started up again. Affiliated people of the municipal government program would stalk me and stare at my abs. I was overwhelmed and could not concentrate academically. The disregard of right of privacy and civil liberties for the sake of a ladies wishes of washboard abs is staggeringly alarming.  Consequently, I suffered anxiety and depression and curriculum activity paused. I was not medicated at the time and could not handle the horse shit. My only avenue of venting, a release was cussing privately. Some people lash out differently like going postal. By cussing, the affiliated people of the matchmaking program would vow to retaliate due to the sign of disrespect such as manipulating business as an extension of there anger to make derogatory comments at me, placing rats in my home, & toxic fumes just to name a few.",

I reacted by slamming her head into the refrigerator. LOL!!  Maybe that wasn't the best thing to do. But it happened. It was kind of a reflex after being hit in the head by a bottle, i just reacted in the moment without thinking. Cops show up, i'm on the hook for a domestic. She walks scott free. I'm gone for a week. No charges on my record. I paid a lawyer about $3,000 and he was able to get me out of the charges. Money well spent. Those kinds of charges follow you your whole life. No Bitch is worth that. But the whole time i was gone she was cheating on me in my apartment. I come home to find her and someone else asleep in my bed. Not wanting to go to prison, i took a breath, and just told them to leave. Three days later, this bitch shows up at my work, with two guys this time. Just to cause a scene. I guess she was trying to get me fired or something. I don't know. When i go home that night, i find all my stuff in my apartment had been smashed up with a metal chain. A day later she comes over all sad faced, wanting to apologize and act like nothing happened. Ummm... no... you can fuck off.  So she freaks out, runs into my bathroom and swallows a whole bottle of tylenol trying to kill herself because i didn't want her anymore. This bitch was 100% nuts. I later learned that her mother has schizophrenia, as well as her maternal grandfather. So i just needed to be as far away from this chic as possible. But she was clingy. I delt with this crazy girl for two years after that. She just wouldn't go away. Once i finally got her out of my life. I haven't dated anyone since. That was 12 years ago. Still out here living the single life. All i need is my dick sucked once in a while and i'm good. I got a friend for that. She's mostly into girls, but her girlfriend likes the D.  So they come over now and then to get what they need. No strings, no drama, no bullshit. We all get off, and go our separate ways. I've known both of these girls since high school. Class of 2003. We've known each other for a long time. Long enough that we trust each other in this type of dynamic. We keep the drama out of it. They are in the relationship. Not me. I'm just an \"Organ Doner\".  Her girlfriend wants some D, she can get it from someone they both know and trust, and who won't make an issue of it. That'd be me. I'm perfectly happy with this arrangement because.... well. who wouldn't be?  \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_/\u00af \n\nAs far as dating and relationships go, i'm over that shit. I don't want or need it. Plus being single is cheaper. My bank account was never this fat when i was dating. LOL!!  \n\nUs mechanics have a saying. It goes. \"If it has tits, or tires, it's going to give you trouble\".  No truer words have been spoken. LOL!!",

And on those sites, if you are a male, here is a reality check for you. Yes, the women there are going to be able to choose. Not you. Dating sites are not going to made out to be like it is on the commercials you see on TV and internet ads if you are a guy. The simple fact is, there are WAY more men there on those things than there are women. And I'd be willing to bet that most of those dudes are creepy af and constantly sending women dick pics and other random weird bullshit. \n\nSo a woman is hit with these messages constantly, and it gives them this empowerment where they can choose exactly who they want, because they essentially get their pick of the litter. Is it right? Is it \"equal\" because you have a pref and so does she? Well, that's the reality of online dating sites. \n\nAnd if you don't believe me, try those things yourself and see how it works out. Eventually you may get lucky, but it's more because she chose you and not the other way around.",
