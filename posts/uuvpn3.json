But I have lost other people in my life, and due to some severe respiratory health conditions, I\u2019m very susceptible to death from Covid, and have had to think about/somewhat plan that future for my partner and my kid since this pandemic started. We\u2019re all vaxxed and boosted as well, but it is a very real possibility for me. I just wanted to say that as the person at risk, if I passed, I would want my partner to keep going. I understand it would be lonely, heavy, empty, and devastating for him. I would want him to seek out support. From friends, family, therapists, whatever is needed, to talk about his feelings and keep going for my kid and for himself. I would want him to cry, to get angry, to not bottle everything up. I would want him to take the time he needs to grieve, and eventually when he felt ready, I would want him to find love again. He deserves to be cared for and loved after I am gone, and my kid deserves to be loved and cared for as well. If you can, I would recommend getting a pet to sleep with if sleeping alone at night is hard or empty. I met my bf a year and a half after my ex and I split. Post divorce, sleeping alone was one of the hardest things for me. My bf got me a cat for my birthday to keep me company in my bed, and it was one of the most thoughtful things I ever experienced. Take life one day at a time. Look for happiness in the small things, and let yourself feel and experience the grief and sadness when it comes up. The pain won\u2019t go away, but it will get less shocking as time goes on. It won\u2019t get less painful, but it will become easier to wade through when it happens. I\u2019m sending you and your family all the best for this next year. \ud83d\udc95",
