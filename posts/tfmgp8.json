  "text": "TIFU by talking my wife into getting 23&me\nTIFU Current wife and I were both married previously and both had 3 children each. We went to hs together in a small town. Both of our families are well known in the area with deep roots (both families been here a long time). Last year I got my wife a ancestry DNA kit as a gift because she wanted to know more about her European roots then her sister decided to do the same.  When their results were posted it started making family connections which included my mother, my oldest son, my uncle etc.  Wife's mom comes in the room so they ask her how we could be related. Her mom starts crying and says that when she was very young she overheard someone say \"Tom\"\" isn't your father, \"Jimmy\" is. Her mom being from older generation says she just put it out of her mind and convinced herself it's just rumor.  \n\n I call my mom asked if she's ever heard a rumor that her father could be my wife's mother's father as well.  She gets quite for a moment and says yes I have and it was believed to be true by her mom as well and that her dad (my grandfather) was a well known cheater/womanizer. \n\n We look further into the information on 23&me and it literally says that my wife and my oldest son share a great grandparent. More of us are now getting test on the same platform but it appears a WW2 Era secret has come to light.\n\nTL;DR wife gets DNA test, discover decades old secret, turns out I married my 1st cousin\n\nEdit: 1:to clear all kids are from both of 1st marriage \n\n2:my mom and wife's mom are apparently half sister's \n\n3: wife's mother is quite upset\n\n4: WW2 was hard on everyone \n     (Trying to not make a joke here)\n\nEDIT 2: At first wife was laughing about this but I'm afraid that the reality of it is caught up to her. Personally I think she's reading to far into it.\n\n I wasn't aware of how prevalent this particular taboo fetish is,  some of yall are freaks. Maybe once this is settled I can have some fun with it. \n\n As I stated all kids are from previous marriages, we're in our mid 40s and will not be having anymore.\n\n We're definitely not in Alabama but we may have to move there now.\n\n Yes we're very much in love and will be staying that way.  Although we probably won't be sharing this information with too many other people...guess we'll keep in the family.",

Just walking down the street , riding a subway, going to a shopping center, you will encounter facial recognition software that is tracking your every move even if it doesn\u2019t know exactly who you are YET. The algorithms will eventually identify you . It\u2019s some scary shit and we still have these people who say, \u201c if you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, what\u2019s there to worry about \u201c . What they fail to understand is what they are doing now may not be wrong, such as )freedom of speech, freedom of expression , gun ownership) , could very well be wrong 20 years from now if you don\u2019t do everything in your power to uphold the Constitution . You can\u2019t let them change this, then expect them not to change that. You make them uphold constitutional rights even if you don\u2019t 100% agree with them.  For instance , the response by the US public should have been complete outrage and demanded that the NSA be disassembled after it broke that they were not only spying on its own citizens , but that it was their mission to collect as much info on  US citizens more than it was to protect the country from outside threats . What happened, a couple million people pitched a fit and everyone else yawned and said, don\u2019t do it again . Absolute power corrupts absolutely \nIf you don\u2019t believe your government is capable and willing to take your basic rights away, you\u2019re naive pure and simple. They yearn for complete power over each and every one of us. If you think Putin is an isolated example of a leader gone mad , he\u2019s not, he just came to a point where his vision of total control was taking to long to happen in his lifetime and he has accelerated the process while the rest of the world makes threats and calls him a bad boy. As soon as it blows over, all will be forgiven and it will be business as usual and the leaders of the world will be patting Putin on the back for \u201c taking one for the team \u201c on the world stage. The world leader club is like a fraternity where your fraternity brothers know your darkest secrets but are bound by oath to never expose those secrets . It\u2019s like their own little MAD doctrine of mutually assured destruction . Biden is talking tough but  throws up road blocks at every turn to truly help Ukraine . Why? Maybe because Putin knows every slimy detail about Juniors dealings in the Region and daddy was a part of it.",

He was the only one who cared\u201d.\nAlso my mother had a black and white photo of her Dad and his family when he was 12. He had brown eyes, and his parents eyes were so blue they weren\u2019t visible except for the pupil. Also there was a big gap between him and his younger siblings. I mentioned that it wasn\u2019t supposed to happen, and wasn\u2019t there some story with his birth certificate not being issued until a year after he was born? My\nMother just mumbled something about a Russian guy and a midwife and a quickly arranged marriage to a much older man. Everyone is always surprised that people still got busy in those days, but it was more common than you think.

My brother answered yes and this guy said he thought Tom Doe might be his father. My brother was Tom Doe II. We all knew what a dog bio dad was. Tom Doe II, asked a few questions and said, \"well, not your dad, but likely your brother. And there's a shitload more of us from marriages and affairs.\"  Guess that was more than our new brother wanted to get involved with. We never heard from him again. \n\nHappily, all known children of the bio dad/dog learned to value spouses. Cheating has never been a thing for any of us. \n\nSome men (and women) are missing the empathy gene, the loyalty and respect needed to remain happy and strong and faithful.",

He only actually ever raised his last son with his 3rd and last wife.\n\n\nHe absolutely had no empathy, only wanted me around because he thought my mom hated him and didn't want me to be in his life. She was absolutely indifferent to him and only cared that I came home upset during my court mandated every other weekend visit. When I visited I spent more time with my step mom and half brother and the only day he spent 100% of the time with me in the 15yrs I knew him he hardly talked to me and fell asleep on the couch watching movies he picked out to watch.\n\nHe thought in his head he could put in the bare minimum and be considered a good guy. I wouldn't be surprised if I did an ancestry thing I would find extra siblings pop up. I wouldn't be surprised if amt were after he married his last wife either.",

So maybe it's a human thing and it's just more apparent in women because we don't like to look at ourselves in that light. \n\n(Yes, I know that the rest of this thread is humor. I get it, and I've had a blast reading it. Y'all are funny as hell.

Clarification of terminology, when the original term very clearly holds a different meaning and thus forms a different context, reads (to me) as a simple, necessary correction.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA pedant on reddit\n\nI'm just fucking around.",

This resulted in all sorts of issues within the family.  It is in fact, thought to be why the Spanish Hapsburgs I think it was, went extinct.\n\n[This article](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-9401315/How-royal-inbreeding-led-Europes-darkest-days.html) has a chart which uses Charles II of Spain as an example to show the close relationships btwn his ancestors.\n\nAt any rate, if you have cousins marrying cousins for generations on down, you wind up with more likelihood of some recessive genes becoming dominant and resulting in deformities and issues with the children.\n\nA one off of half-cousins marrying each other isn't really that big of a deal, but if they had children together and those children kept marrying cousins, it would within a generation or two become A Very Big Deal.^(TM)",

Like I found it pretty strange seeing people who grew up together as kids and then get married and it\u2019s fine just because they\u2019re not blood.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing if they\u2019re just causal friends, but like for example on the CW The Flash show, Iris West and Barry Allen grew up together. They weren\u2019t just friends, they were practically siblings. Barry\u2019s mom was killed and dad was arrest when he was like 6-8, and then he was raised by Iris\u2019s father. He was more of a dad to Barry than his own father was. He lived in the same house as her and they were raised as siblings. \n\nThen they go off and get married and have kids and it\u2019s fine because they\u2019re not blood related \n\nLike I don\u2019t find Leia kissing Luke that weird because they were raised apart and didn\u2019t know they were related. Obviously once they found out it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to have a relationship or have kids. But they didn\u2019t know. \n\nBut step siblings who knew each other since they were kids is so weird to start relationships\n\nI met my step sister when she was 3 and I was 5. She became my step sister when I was 10. We were raised together. I can\u2019t imagine being in a relationship with her. \n\nBut if I was an adult and suddenly my parents remarried and I got a new step sibling and the two of us were attracted to each other, I wouldn\u2019t find it that bad \n\nTo me the closeness as children is what makes relationships weird, not technicality stuff. \n\nThat being said that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m saying it\u2019s okay for siblings to date just cause they were raised apart. Even if they didn\u2019t have kids; and knew each other prior to finding out they were siblings and fell in love, the revelation alone would cause intense shock and trauma. Therapy would 100% be necessary. It would be a tough situation. Cause just knowing they\u2019re your sibling might negate all your feelings for them. Or make you feel guilty for loving them. It\u2019s a whole can of worms that I don\u2019t think has a right answer. Some people think if it\u2019s blood, it\u2019s automatically wrong. I\u2019d argue that it\u2019s up to the couple. The trauma from the revelation is enough to ruin most relationships. But if the couple decides to not have kids and realize that they fell in love before knowing and goes to therapy, who knows, maybe it could work. If they\u2019re not harming anyone I don\u2019t see it as the end of the world. Even though I wouldn\u2019t do it",

Since the generations between Victoria and Elizabeth II were all male, Elizabeth II cannot have inherited the gene on Victoria's X chromosome.\n\nAlso, since it's X-linked and recessive, males only have to inherit one copy of the gene (no backup gene on the Y chromosome), while female children must inherit two copies, one on each X chromosome they get.",

You CAN tell companies to keep your data private to at least a certain degree and not to store your sample.  That will somewhat limit you in what you can find out, but it could give a head start.\n\nI honestly don't really know what to say about folks who are uncomfortable sending their DNA in.  Don't get me wrong, on a certain level, I get it, but I can also tell you that the service is invaluable to adoptees and/or folks of uncertain parentage.\n\nAs an example, my husband was adopted at birth.  He did 23andMe and Ancestry.  Found his birth mom who was not only still alive and well but lives in the same town we do!  She was very young and was lied to about the fate of the child she gave up, so finding us was a shock but turned out to be an exciting one.\n\nThrough that we've been able to solve some other family mysteries.\n\nIn my personal case, I found out one of my Uncle's fathered an illegitimate child and I was able to connect her with her half siblings.  \n\nHaving said all that.... do you know anything at all about your parent's birth family?  A lot can depend on what state they were born in.  It is possible, depending on the state, that they might be able to write and get their original birth certificate and other records.  Some states will only send non identifying information, some will send the whole shebang, some are extremely closed and you basically have no hope.  My husband was born in one of the \"no hope\" states, so without the genetic testing we would have no idea of his parentage.\n\nIf you have the name of your other parent and certain pertinent details like date and place of birth you might be able to track down documents for them.  \n\nIt gets kind of tricky when dealing with adoption and very little info.  It's not impossible, it's just made a lot harder without genetic testing.\n\nHaving said that though, if you have at least some identifying information for your parents you could do a [Newspapers.com](https://Newspapers.com) search to see if there were any articles written, or you can do an Ancestry trial to see if a records search will glean anything.  There are also numerous genealogy groups and adoption groups out there.  You might be able to post the information of your parent who was adopted and get a hit there.\n\nI hope this helps!",

LOL\n\nSo, I will try to keep it brief for you so as to hopefully avoid your eyes rolling back in your head and you going \"Why did I ask!?\"  LOL\n\nI discovered several years ago through a cousin doing some research, that one of my 8th great grandmothers was Sarah Warren Prince Osborne who is known only because she was one of the original women accused of witchcraft in Salem.\n\nEssentially from what I've been able to piece together, is that her husband died, she shacked up with her Irish indentured servant (double no-no) and eventually married him.  They then for some reason contested her husbands will and tried to take away the property rights that her children inherited.  I'm honestly not sure to what end.  I saw something once that she and her new husband had children together so maybe it was to let them inherit?  I don't know.  But anyway.... as I recall, she died in jail awaiting trial.\n\nAnd then on the other side of my family, I am directly descended from William Leete (11th great grandfather - born in 1612) who was one of the early governors of Connecticut (possibly the 1st - again my memory is fuzzy).  \n\nTo me this stuff is absolutely fascinating and I frequently get lost for hours in research.",

This minimizing of the consequences of close inbreeding doesn't jibe.\n\nDawkins reckons humans on average carry one or two exceedingly rare lethal recessive genes (which if paired would result in death by childhood or earlier). Regardless of how rare these might be throughout the population, for any one that you carry, there's a roughly 50% chance your sibling also does (because you share roughly 50% of your DNA). If you have a child with your sibling, that child has a 50% of inheriting the lethal gene from you, and 50% from your sibling (conditional on their 50% chance of carrying it). (1/2)^3 = 1/8 chance of your child inheriting two copies of the lethal gene and being born dead or dying shortly after.\n\nThat's per gene - if you carry two or three or four, it's additive. And that's just speaking of lethal genes, which necessarily will be extremely rare. Factor in non-lethal recessive genes that are rare but not exceedingly so, and that when homozygous will make your life unpleasant but not ensure that you won't reproduce to pass them on, and sibling inbreeding becomes a dangerous game indeed. I believe the same math holds for parent-child inbreeding.\n\nAgain I'm no expert, just a guy who happens to be reading a classic book that addresses this, so if I've misinterpreted anything I'd love to learn.",

They should still be illegal for a host of good arguments, but the genetic argument just isn't a good one.***\n\n\nAnd yeh, It's no different and i'm not advocating we say incest is ok it's just a funny discussion on morality and how we apply it differently in different cases. \n\nBut personally i think the best reason for incest being taboo/illegal is the grooming issue, as if it was legal it would be almost impossible to determine if people were groomed or not. \n\nAnd even in a sibling relationship there's no way that you could say there is an equal power dynamic there that would allow for a consensual relationship",

You would find that you share btwn 984-2462 CM with your grandparents.  Granted there is a small overlap in the maximum number of CM shared with grandparents and the minimum number shared with parents, but that frequently only presents itself in situations of endogamy.  \n\nWhen you get down to cousin relationships, if you are not furthering any endogamous relationships, then the DNA relationship becomes diluted.  So half cousins can share as much as around 12% but will never share 25-50% unless there is a whole hell of a lot of endogamy going on.",

Accidental cousin marriages are well within our genetic tolerance, and unless you purposefully do it for generations it is not very risky. (IIRC it is not significantly more risky than marrying anyone.)\n\nThe reason it gets bad after generations is because each successive generation of cousins begins to share more DNA than the one prior. So after a while, even if you marry your first cousin they are genetically more like sibling genetically. If you have any genetic diversity being introduced this wont ever really be a problem.\n\nHonestly, it is fairly likely that a lot of us are married to people with similar genes to us, despite not being related, just by sheer chance. There are a lot of marriages.",

Covering up what other family members did.\n\nSecond, shame is without exception a bad thing. Guilt is great, though! Guilt says \"I did something wrong\" which means you can take responsibility and try to do better in the future. Shame says \"I ***am*** something wrong\" which just makes you hate yourself and believe there's no way to improve.\n\nSaying you're fundamentally broken is not only toxic to you, but to everyone around you because it allows you to sidestep ever taking accountability for your actions - if you're just bad, you can't improve, so why bother trying?\n\nSo yeah, people who do bad things should feel guilty. Families of people who do bad things shouldn't internalize that as them being bad people via association who need to hide the truth at any cost or risk everyone knowing they're not actually good.",

For siblings, the average shared is 50%, but the range is 38-61% (I presume the range spans +/- 2 standard deviations).\n\nlink for % shared and the associated variability for various familial relationships: [https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212170668-Average-Percent-DNA-Shared-Between-Relatives](https://customercare.23andme.com/hc/en-us/articles/212170668-Average-Percent-DNA-Shared-Between-Relatives)",

If you are aware you are first cousins, you can get genetic testing to establish if there is a high risk of any genetic abnormalities being passed on. If genetic issues are found then the cousins can make an informed choice going forward. And yes there is a lot of evidence that indicates first cousins who reproduce have a higher chance of producing disabled offspring. The chances are increased further in cultures where first cousins have been marrying for generations so they are even more inbred and tend to have more severely disabled children, and at a higher percentage than the wider population. Their needs are often complex and require a lot of medical care and full time care at home.",

And 2nd or 3rd cousins are effectively strangers.  So OP could have 10 kids if he wanted, really. \n\n It only becomes an issue if those kids then also go on to marry first cousins.  Then there is a slight correlation, but only with repetitive generations of cousin-fucking. \n\n In fact some studies suggest 2nd and 3rd cousins are actually *better* partners to have children with than complete strangers and have *lower* birth defect rates because if I recall the reasoning was that there is decreased chance of incompatible genomes or antagonistic genetics that don't pair up well",

Anyway wife and I already had a kid together and both our parents basically said not to overthink it. Our son is perfectly healthy growing baby. Although I was initially weirded out and a little shocked, after doing some research I no longer had any worry because as far as I can tell there isn't any other intermarriage that could cause any genetic issues so long as it doesn't become a regular thing with our children grandchildren, etc. Yes its taboo, but genetically it is relatively safe as long as it doesn't carry on down the line.",

He went on and married someone else and had a few kids. \n\nHe ended up straying from that marriage with his previous girlfriend's younger sister. Ended up getting her pregnant actually (at the same time as his actual wife). That was enough to get him divorced. Since he had the younger sister pregnant, he decided to go ahead and move in / marry her. \n\nNow we're all assuming that he knew his previous girlfriend was adopted and that her younger sister was not biologically related. The problem is that he didn't know (and most people didn't) that he and his new baby momma shared the same great grandparents. \n\nSo now this dude has 3 kids with his first wife, and 2 more with his cousin. Yup that's right... after they realized that they were related they went ahead and got pregnant again. Bonus: they are now antivaxers because they claim that childhood vax series made their first child \"dumb\". \n\nAll 100% true. Hopefully this gives you something to laugh about and a chance to move forward. \n\nCheers!",

Genetic problems are exasperated but not caused by inbreeding. Inbreeding doesn't magically make mutations appear, it just means because more genes are shared they are more likely to appear. But if you saw a genetic specialist, they could tell you if you have any issues.\n\nIt used to be totally normal to marry your cousin. Both Charles Darwin and Edgar Allan Poe married their cousins.",

They spent the rest of their lives together, happily. Didn't have any kids, but he was my mom's step father and she adored him. \n\nMind you, this was Kentucky, but about the same era. They moved states, and no one knew. \n\nHonestly, inbreeding is mostly a problem if it's parent- child, and or if it's continued in multiple generations. \n\nIn some cultures, it's normal. Royal families did it for years. Wealthy Arab families still often arrange marriages between cousins to keep wealth in the family.\n\nIt's culturally taboo, but. I wouldn't worry too much about it.",

Lucky for my aunt and uncle a lady from the Adoption agency adopted them to avoid them having been split up. My uncle was not so keen on meeting his biological family but eventually he came around and did meet us and the both of them and their combined 5 children (2 from uncle and 3 from aunt) also enjoy knowing us.  \n\n\nEveryone in the family who might have cared about the fact of there being illigitimate children  from grandma(not that we can be sure that they would have) was already dead. My great grandmother (grandma's mom) having passed away in 2001, and my grandfather having passed away in 2003.  \n\n\nNo one, not us, not the adoption agency, not anyone as far as I know, knows who their father is. But hey I got a cool new aunt and uncle (and their spouses) and 5 cool new cousins that day.",

For 47 years I thought I had a daughter.  When I finally talked to my daughter, we cried a lot, but we both realized in the end, she IS my daughter and I AM her dad.

There's a bit of fear mongering on one side and hand waving on the other.\n\nhttps://www.huffpost.com/entry/23andme-warnings-at-home-genetic-test_n_5c01b108e4b0606a15b54dae\n\nRelevant bits:\n\n>Let\u2019s start with the good news: Thanks to the\u00a0Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act\u00a0\u2015 aka GINA \u2015 employers and health insurance providers cannot discriminate against Americans based on genetic information. Your health insurance is in the clear.\n\n>Unfortunately, though,\u00a0GINA\u00a0does not protect members of the U.S. Military, Indian Health Service, Veterans Administration, federal employees and those who work for a company with fewer than 15 employees, Vance explained. Additionally, GINA does not apply to life insurance, disability or long-term care insurance in most states, meaning that these premiums could very well fluctuate based on your test results.\n\n>\u201cYes, life insurance carriers can adversely discriminate and rate for risks when it comes to previous genetic testing results,\u201d said Jason P. Veirs, owner and president of\u00a0InsuranceExperts.com,\u00a0who specializes in life, disability, health and long-term care insurance.\n\n>That being said, most providers don\u2019t specifically ask about genetic testing (yet) nor can they require you to get genetic testing done, Veirs said. However, if you have taken a genetic test and the insurance company asks for it, you technically need to disclose that information.\n\n>\u201cThe insurance carriers also rely on the applicant providing accurate health information, therefore, if you\u2019ve had testing that showed a proclivity or susceptibility towards a certain cancer or disease \u2015 even if not performed by a physician \u2015 then it would most likely have to be disclosed on the application,\u201d Veirs said.\n\n>Lastly, if you\u2019ve gotten genetic testing and it\u2019s in your medical records, it will pop up during the underwriting process, which can spike up your rates. Veirs recommended securing a policy prior to getting any testing done. Once your insurance is in place, the carrier cannot ding you for any positive genetic test results, he said.",

Some people care about their private information and dont want shared especially for other people and companies to profit from it. I guess you are too narrow minded, and believe the only reason to be opposed to having your information sold for profit is because you want to commit s crime which really speaks volume to how your mind works. I really do bet you think vpns are scams because good people have nothing to hide and internet companies should just be allowed to sell your data and vpns are only for people who want to commit fraud and nothing else.",

There's no way you're ever going to have every disease that you have a predisposition for and it's a way for insurance companies already worth billions of dollars, to charge people even more money. That is why they are buying this data from DNA tests. It's so they can charge people more money at the end of the day for diseases they didn't even know they had a chance of getting which doesn't mean they wanted to commit fraud it means they literally didn't know about it, but you're too stupid to realize that point.\n\nOh you have a 5% chance of getting this super rare disease so we're going to charge you 5% more in your insurance bill from now on even if you never get it.

      "text": "It is pretty much a case of \"now you know\", OP. Besides that knowledge - your situation remains the same as you said that you do not share any illnesses nor have kids together or plan more. I'd still consult a geneticist about your whole family tree, albeit if nothing dangerous ever came up in your family lines you should be fine (not that I know of anything that you and your wife could be affected by offset by that). As others said - it is a frighteningly common thing to happen to folks without their knowledge. What is done is done though.\n\nMy mum used to have a coworker who got the worst revelation (mum worked with her after she has). She grew up with her parents while her husband was an orphan and they lived on opposite sides of Poland. They both went to work in France as young adults, where they met, fell in love and married. Afterwards, they moved to England and had a daughter (perfectly healthy and still is). At some point, the girl's mum rang her that she has heard her mother (the girl's grandma) had some genetic heart defect and she just got tested herself. Mum's coworker did just that and all was fine, but then they moved on to test her daughter. It also skipped her but turns out mum's coworker and her husband were siblings. Said coworkers dad cheated on his wife with the husband's mum who has died after giving birth. The dad had no idea she got pregnant or died (I assume it was a one night stand) nor did his wife know about this or the girl's husband as his mum never listed the father. \n\nThey were just planning another kid then but dropped the idea and somehow managed to get under the legal radar presumably because the husband had no listed father and the geneticist did not want to condemn a happy family to persecution (also - they married in France). Incest is pretty much illegal on that level which is why they had no other way unless they accepted divorce and no relationship.\n\nLife's stupidly ironic and crap sometimes.",

We divorced and when my daughter was 22, I told her of situation. Mom vehemently denied it and accused me of being an awful person for suggesting it. In 2002 mom died and the truth just festered until I suggested that my daughter join Ancestry in 2017. It was revealed that I wasn\u2019t her biological father. We\u2019re still communicating and she wasn\u2019t able to find her other dad. I suggest that this \u201csecret\u201d misappropriation of paternity be ended. It causes unnecessary pain.

When they met with her she literally just cried about finally finding blood family and even stated that she only wanted to know her family.

Half-sister right at the top of the page.  I connected with her through the app, became friends on FB, and then was able to connect with my biological father.\n\nIt's only been a little over a month, but the three of us communicate every day.  We've talked about meeting up, but haven't made solid plans yet.\n\n2020 and 2021 were rough for me.  Lost my older brother in 2020 and my wife in 2021, literally one day to the year that I lost my brother.  After terrible losses, it was awesome getting some gains.  I only wish my wife was here to see this.  She was big on family and would've been elated.\n\nAs an aside, while going through my sister's profile, I found a picture of her that looks nearly identical to an ex of mine \ud83d\ude14.  My younger brother started calling me sisterfucker.\n\nEdit: I just turned 40 at the end of 2021.  Took me over 40 years to find my biological father.",

My stepdaughter had wanted to get dna testing thinking she may get financial assistance for school from the Cherokee Nation since my husband and his entire family were always told they were Native American. He sure looks it! So I sent off for our ancestry kits. \n\nHis uncle wrote a book on the Trail of Tears; his mother has a huge painting of her in full headdress and could read tea leaves when she was a child. She learned from an older aunt. \n\nThe results came back and he didn't have one spec of Native American. His ancestors came from France and settled in a little town that no longer exists - Cherokee, TX.  So somewhere along the way it went from, \"I'm from Cherokee, Hi, I'm from Cherokee.\" to, \"I'm Cherokee, Hi, I'm Cherokee!\" They were not too happy about it at all! \n\nAnd I found I am a completely different race than I thought I was which I think is hysterical. People really should decide if they are prepared for anything when they get these kits! And I do mean Anything! \n\nI hope you and your wife, blended family, well not so blended (joking!) live Happily Ever After!!",

She married my siblings Dad had the three of them and then I came along with a fling she had with my dad when he was home from the military . But since she was already married I was kept a secret. I am an adult now and everyone now knows as their dad is no longer in the picture. My siblings are still the same to me as before we found out and they feel the same way. I will say there is that little bit of resentment for the lies and I have a hard time trusting anyone now. But furthermore I just think it\u2019s important for people to know truths even if it\u2019s for medical purposes. Family history of conditions can play a huge part of diagnosis.",

I think research from prominant scientists such as Gregory Mendel and Charles Darwin helped in the risks imposed on reproduction between closely related organisms.  Even looking at dogs for example.  Purebred animals are inbred animals.  They have many  conditions and diseases inherent in their DNA from this.  First cousins in my family married a few generations back and had deaf children.  A friend of mine had two first cousins marry without knowing initially (very complicated family dynamics) and had 2 children with severe mental and physical disabilities.  It is surprising, but humans have very low genetic variability between non related individuals already, adding in relatedness, you increase the risk of death, and various conditons on your offspring.  In this instance, you already have had your children with other people.  Don't worry about it and live your life.",

This includes all the genetic material that, once sent to [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com) became THEIR property - and thus now Black Rocks?  Black Rock says \"....IT has no plans to provide the genetic material to the health insurance industry...\" but, it IS in the business and buying and selling companies, so....\n\nIf you were an health insurance company (say, ummm.. United Healthcare for instance) do you think that your organization might be interested in hundreds of thousands of  samples of genetic material from known donors - to help prevent expensive payouts of benefits on conditions such as Alzheimer's Disease or ALS which might be revealed in said material?  Do you think that you (as a top health insurance provider) might be interested in that?\n\nHummmm.",

      "text": "Wife and I got ancestry before we got married. We got it as a joke, because we are from completely different parts of the world (she's Pacific Islander, I'm European). Her's comes back roughly 70% Islander, 20% Portuguese, 8% East Asian, 1% Scottish, 1% Other. I'm 40% British, 20% Norwegian, 15% Swedish, 15% Irish, 5% Scottish, 5% First Nations. We broke it to her family that, in fact, we were cousins, because you know....we're both Scottish. Haha April fools....\n\nYears later, we decided to go down the ancestry rabbit hole. We went to the island her mother was born on and found a ton of records. Turns out, her great great grandmother was half white. Her grandmother had come from Massachusetts in the mid 1800's. I make a small comment that both sides of my family came from Mass. as well. She dismisses it, but that info lingers with me. We take our notes, and I try to write down all the info I can find on this 4x great grandmother.\n\nMonths go by after we get home before I come across my notes again. I get the itch to look stuff up and go further down the rabbit hole. No connection in Massachusetts. Then I start finding info on parts of the family that came from Britain to the Colonies early on. That only goes back so far, but I find a website dedicated to family history and family trees (similar to Ancestry, but not). I upload and find even further connections going back to the 1400's. I mention this to my wife's older sister, and she gets super intrigued. She makes a tree for her family, in hopes to make further European connections.\n\nWhat this site also does is try to find connections between people through the connected trees, connections that may not be super apparent. This is where I found out that I'm 17th cousins with Prince Charles. This is also where I found out that I'm 24th cousins with my wife's grandmother, and that connection comes from the British Isles. My 24th Great Grandfather (my wife's 26th) was the 1st Earl of Winchester.\n\nI find it funny, and take it with a grain of salt. After all, aren't we all related somewhere down the line? She wasn't amused. Either way, this connection is the only connection I've been able to find, but only represents my mother's side of the family tree. I keep telling my wife that it honestly could go either way. We're either more closely related on my father's side, someone in the last 800 years was unfaithful and we're not related at all, or the website has any number of errors in the family tree's because we are fallible creatures. And lastly, its a single connection, 26-28 generations old! There's no blood left to share.",

He would supervise the surveying and planning of the new project, but likely be transferred again before the year was up.   \nHe was between marriages and seems to have left some DNA behind after one of the transfers that sent him two states away. A few months later he had a son he never knew about. This was long before cell phones, internet or even TV, so it was not easy to track mobile acquaintances.",

And put some distance between yourselves, an all of the wise cracks your family is putting out there. I've had  problems with my narcissistic family members.

They either wouldn't laugh if it was them or go total perv with it. Give your wife the support she needs, as well as her Mom. She did nothing wrong either, nor did your Mom. I'm not sure of the size of the town you're in, but my Hometown is well over 30,000. I used to know everyone there, and heard all the rumors (some true), and just went on about my business. I was drafted into the military at age 19 and ended up in Vietnam a couple of times. I returned home afterward, and realized there were warmer and nicer places in this World before finally settling in Texas. I still get info from the folks up there, but just let it roll off. \n\nBut I'm a bad guy, because I've had two affairs. The first ended up causing a divorce, and a son was born just after I left. I was not given information about a pregnancy, because I tried to save my marriage and cut off all ties with the gal. I remarried here, and had a good life going. I became stupid when my oldest daughter was dying from cancer. I cheated a second time. My daughter died, and ripped me apart, but I decided to save my marriage at all cost. I did. I stopped everything. Then about 10 years later, my wife up and walked out, saying I had mental issues. Ok, I had some anger issues, and was still depressed. I definitely was not messing around anymore, but was accused of it. I only went to work, and back home. I was easy to follow, and I was never late or going to a beer joint or anything. Didn't make any difference. Thats been 10 years now. I'm still not married or seeing anyone. But.... My family in my hometown wanted me to do the 23 and me test. I finally did it, not knowing what to expect. My extra son doesn't show up. Neither does anyone else that shouldn't. It gets better.... \n\nOn one of my trips back to see my family, the first gal I cheated with, and I had a hookup for a couple of days. Didn't pay much attention or anything. The year before last, she contacted me because our Grandson was having health issues at age 3. She asked questions about health in my family, and I gave her the information. Then... Her daughter, who was named similar to my daughter, went into a career field I had been in with no idea by anyone that I had been doing it. Well, after discussing it, we laughed, and were talking about the birthdate. OMG!! She MIGHT be mine! As long as there is no DNA test, all is good. \n\nCrazy things happen in life. None of us are perfect. I did what I did, and I've paid the price many times over. The difference here, is that everyone knew about me, and I never denied it. \n\nAgain, give support, get counseling, perhaps in another town if y'all think you need it. Keep on loving each other, and help the Mom's out.",
