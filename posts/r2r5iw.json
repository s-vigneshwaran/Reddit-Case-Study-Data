This has never been about CFR it's about virality. Even two years in and with all the vaccine and mitigation efforts you still get local areas where hospital resources are stretched\n\nThat treatment has to be readily available to work. That's why omicron caused panic its not about if it's deadlier its about if it's more contagious and not way less deadly. Even if only X% of people need hospitalization and only X% die it doesn't take X being very high to consume all resources\n\nAdd on top this view asked hospital workers to work at full on panic mode for years and hope they don't start offing themselves at even higher rates",

Florida in all the hubbub the media made about it only had a few rural hospitals delay electives for a few weeks. Same for Missouri. You really must have zero faith in the vaccine if you think the hospitals are going to be flooded *now* after all of this.\n\n> This has never been about CFR\n\nYeah, the conversation above was literally talking about CFR. It's not my fault for correcting them being stupid. Also, guess what? The IFR and severity of the disease is actually exactly what you should be concerned with as that's what puts people in the hospital. I don't give a fuck if you catch a cold. The pandemic has been over since we got our vaccines since that's exactly what it turns into for literally everyone that isn't vulnerable. And >90% of the vulnerable are vaccinated so if they get sick the small number of them that did get hospitalized before are going to be reduced to 1/10th of that. If you don't want to worry about it you should get vaccinated too.\n\n> That's why omicron caused panic\n\nOmicron hasn't caused panic. I mean, they're trying their damnedest to on the news, but literally everyone I know is just laughing at the stupid name. Even the market analysts aren't concerned about the virus itself, they're all worried that crazy governments are going to try their objectively and measurably failed mitigation efforts again and fuck the poor and middle class *again*. All while we have a COVID opt out button available to us.\n\n> Add on top this view asked hospital workers to work at full on panic mode for years and hope they don't start offing themselves at even higher rates\n\nThey're firing unvaxxed workers in the blue states, so I'm pretty sure they're fine. Suicide and overdoses have finally started to come down since we stopped locking down and social distancing is basically over too. You won't be able to convince me hospitals are fucked since up until a few months ago I knew first hand what was going on in them and while the media was running around with its hair on fire the nurses I talked to on a daily basis were business as usual even during the spikes.",

I don't understand why you think that's okay, or why you think observing some very basic and non-intrusive preventive measures aren't worth following to prevent those deaths. \n\nWhat's more is that not everyone who survives covid goes right back to 100% normal or healthy. The more the virus is allowed to spread to new hosts the more dangerous it potentially becomes as it has more opportunities to mutate. If you can't understand these things, why am I the brainlet?",

Most long term damage comes from an accompanying pneumonia. COVID is not special in terms of long term damage.\n\n> If you can't understand these things, why am I the brainlet?\n\nBecause you don't understand them yourself.\n\nYou're also making assumptions about the efficacy of policies. In countries which implemented them \"successfully\" the efficacy of them was similarly awful. So, even when implemented appropriately your policies are shit from lock downs to mask mandates. If you blame people not following them, that means you've created a policy so unrealistic it's unimplementable and you don't get an excuse of \"nobody listened to us\" when it fails. That's the policy maker's fault not the people.",

These include, but are not limited to:\n \n* Rudeness towards other Redditors,\n* Spreading incorrect information,\n* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.\n \n## Am I banned from the Reddit?\n \nNo - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.\n \n## I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?\n \nSure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.\n \n## How can I prevent this from happening in the future?\n \nAccept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",

I know nothing about the financial side of it all, but it's fucking *Gamestop.* Their physical location have become Funko Pop stores and their online presence is just another 3rd party marketplace like Amazon, eBay, and now even Walmart. They'll give someone $2 for their trade in and then turn around and sell that new release for $5 cheaper than buying it from the publisher like the leeches that they are. They're largely to blame for the state of the physical vs digital-only games and publishers now much more preferring to sell non-transferable copies of games instead of a tangible, shareable, re-sellable hard copy, driving up the cost of anything real in comparison to their virtual counterparts. \n\nThey do run some good deals on hardware swaps sometimes, but I suspect those function as a sort of loss-leader item.",

I'd sure love if the apes got their fabled moon payday, but there's no fucking way Wallstreet lets that happen even with the direct shares. For the people who are just putting in some money for the lulz, that's fine. But people are gloating about putting 100% their portfolio into GME even this late into 2021.

That's a gross misrepresentation.\n\nSo the quarantine facilities of the Northern Territory have been used to house returned overseas travellers up until recently with the small outbreak in the Territory. What the article neglects to do is provide any context which makes sending in the army and sending people to the facility as a perfectly reasonable thing to do.\n\nThere are populations in the NT that are extremely remote. It's an area 4 times the size of Germany with less than 250,000 people living in it.\n\nHealthcare services (eg. Hospitals) aren't easily available to a significant amount of this population and many live in small communities of usually no more than 150 people. Accessibility is made even more difficult at this time of year due to it being the Wet Season. Some of the only access roads into these communities may be flooded.\n\nSo yeah, it makes sense to mobilize the army to help \"round up\" people when it's logistically challenging. And sending them to \"internment camps\" makes sense when their community has no adequate access to a facility that can give them a space to isolate and be monitored and treated.\n\nBut please, feel free to continue peddling bullshit.",
