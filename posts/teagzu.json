Die letzten f\u00fcnf Minuten waren auf Jiddisch!\"\n\nEveryone let out an audible sigh of relief because nobody wanted to be the one to admit they couldn't understand anything - but it sounded so close to German that we couldn't tell it was because it wasn't German. Kinda like listening to Dutch...\n\nEdit: LMAO someone else mentioned A Serious Man a bit lower and I'm pretty sure that was the movie!",

We are also a young nation (in the sense of colonisation anyway) and have both a strong history of immigration intermingled with indigenous culture\u2026just like the US.  Our immigration was not always motivated by the same things and our stories may somewhat differ, but we have such a rich and diverse mix of cultures in Australia - just as you do in many parts of the US.

You see where a loaded, hate directed statement can lead someone ? It\u2019s not really that hard to connect the dots when so many people just get a rage boner for hating on Americans. So I apologize for the assumption. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s still different, though I would agree that there are similarities in history. The search for identity in American culture is very strong, and civil rights issues are still problems Americans have faced since the inception of our nation a couple centuries ago. The US is massive, and we divide ourselves readily. It causes cultures to abandon their way of life in favor of the American one. This causes a widespread cultural identity crisis. That was my initial point and why I used \u201cmelting pot\u201d in quotations because it\u2019s an easy mark to target to get my point across. \n\nThat ideology is part of what Americans know and repeat, but you see it as \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d. They mean the same thing, but you see it as a negative thing to assert that Americans think they\u2019re special to assume it\u2019s different. I get your frustration but unfortunately that\u2019s how our media has led many of the American people to perceive it. \u201cBe proud we have such a melting pot of individuals, see? we\u2019re diverse\u201d. That\u2019s a good thing, coming from many years of political struggle. You\u2019re conflating a simple analogy to lots of Americans being ignorant. While you may not be entirely incorrect, you\u2019re not being fair either. This is merely a product of the nuances of American culture and how we see ourselves within the system. So close together yet so far apart, removed from our identity but surrounded by it, all of it. Surrounded by other cultures identities too. Inclusiveness is our mantra, yet in practice it doesn\u2019t work that way. Ignorance is found in all walks of life , I was merely saying that it\u2019s a very American thing to want to be something you\u2019re not, yet also are. Wanting to be a part of a culture (be special) yet you\u2019re not? Wasn\u2019t your point that we\u2019re not special or different ? I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s probably why Americans say that",

There are exceptions to the rule when it comes to clinging to your heritage and their roots across different ethnicities. (Family values, culture values? overseas bonds, etc).\n\nWhat my initial point is that when you have all these hard boiled Americans that live very Americanized lifestyles who are 4th or 5th generation American, they have a yearning to seek identity within their respective parent cultures apart from the American one. It used to be very, very discouraged to let your colors show, so many immigrant families opted to allow their culture within their families be consumed entirely. \n\nWhile you are correct that the American culture isn\u2019t particularly inclusive by design, that was not what I was referring to. That contention is part of what makes influence among the popular topics and various ideologies though. As referenced : your friend who you mentioned is a minority of Chinese descent who believe they have an n word pass simply because they are a minority. I believe that thought process is deeply American because it reflects the culture. \n\nIt\u2019s really not that different from things you see across the world, but to deny people their own culture because they don\u2019t fully understand it or are not immersed in it anymore is unfortunately the reality in the minds of many Americans and is part of the culture too. \nExamples:Mexican Americans are looked down on if they don\u2019t act or dress a certain way/speak the language. African Americans are looked down on if they act too \u201cwhite\u201d. You become ostracized until theres a complete disconnect. The \u201cwhite\u201d population is a huge mix of different people from different places, who all are now under that umbrella term. Who can blame them for wanting to feel included or be excited when they\u2019re a third Irish?  They\u2019re ignorant, yes, but they\u2019re proud.",

I love visiting my family and my mum has always enjoyed people cherishing their family history when they\u2019d hear her accent. What\u2019s your clan?\u201d Blah blah. Funnily enough we don\u2019t have one as we\u2019re all Irish Catholics. They\u2019d always get her accent wrong but it\u2019s okay. No harm, eh? Americans are the same too. They\u2019re not all like that. \n\nI think people just like feeling a \u201cconnection\u201d to their heritage. And to be quite fair, no one that\u2019s immigrated over to Canada and the USA has ever said to me (and I\u2019m friends with loads of ex-pats) they\u2019d like to move back home. They enjoy the lifestyle here, the weather. The only thing my family misses are the hills. I\u2019d be ecstatic when the day comes my kids are wanting to know about their extended family and who they are. What\u2019s wrong with being proud of that?",

I\u2019m from Minnesota and my grandparents have told me countless tales of the feuds between different European groups in their small towns. The Swedes burnt down the Norwegian church. The Germans wouldn\u2019t dare go into the Finnish bar. It was considered taboo to marry across the lines. And so on and so fourth. \n\nAnd the cultural differences have been blurred a bit between the different Nordic countries after a few generations but there\u2019s still massive cultural differences between, for example, a family with German catholic ancestry from Wisconsin and a family with Swedish Protestant ancestry in Minnesota.  The German family is probably larger, louder, and a bit warmer. The Scandinavian family is probably a bit smaller, a bit more shy, and maybe a bit more calculated. Stereotyping for sure but you get the idea. \n\nAmericans in certain parts of the country still refer to themselves as \u201cbeing\u201d Scandinavian or German or whatever often times to signal that they *do* belong to a distinct culture even if it\u2019s completely detached from the people of the origin country.",

I\u2019m a melange of whiteness, and you\u2019d think with the four different strains I got one of them would contain a bit of melanin. Nope, I got the freckly, moon tan strains that evolved in all the cold and dark places. \n\nI definitely don\u2019t claim any cultural heritage from the respective counties that contributed to my genetics although I do look for physical characteristics that might be similar sometimes. In a place like Australia it sometimes feels like there isn\u2019t a definitive culture to identify with. The fact that the country was stolen only 200 years ago and is built on subsequent generations of immigration might attribute to people looking for cultural roots from before their time - although the trend seems stronger in America.",

As far as I was aware \nall Ireland were separate kingdoms like Munster and Meath until they were conquered by the U.K.\n\nI\u2019m not pro Ireland being under the U.K. as it might sound by saying this BTW, even though I would hope you wouldn\u2019t think that anyway, I\u2019ve just seen that some Protestants are and I\u2019m interested in your perspective. I think any people have a right to independence if they want it and that boat of being the same country passed during the Irish oppression and particularly the lack of aid in the famine.

Whether there was U.K. influence or not in keeping the land, obviously the UK government didn\u2019t want to let any land go, I have only known that they only held Northern Ireland due to local support, especially since there have been referendums to allow Northern Ireland to unite which the Northern Irish have rejected.",

Anyway our man got more and more into character so I asked where in Ireland he was from.   Out came the family tree slide show, and he proudly announced his great great grandfather hailed from Troon. That\u2019s right kids, Troon Scotland.  Cue another geography class, to which he admitted maybe he\u2019d been mistaken but we\u2019re all Celtic nations anyway (his new word i taught him earlier) so it didn\u2019t matter because he was Irish at heart.  \n\nWas quite a ride.",

There\u2019s pride in relating to the American identity, sure, but along with that also comes with pride of how one\u2019s family got here and from where. \n\nthe first and second generation of immigrants from someone who moved usually have it pressed into them where their family is from and how they got there, and they pass that heritage on to their descendants to keep the tradition going. In most places heritage doesn\u2019t matter too much but places like Wisconsin are almost entirely populated by people of Swedish descent which leads to the distinctive accent there, West Virginia/Appalachia are largely descended from Scots-Irish (which most people who say they\u2019re \u201cirish\u201d in the US overwhelmingly mean Scots Irish) which also has noticeable affect on the accent. I have mannerisms such as intrusive R in a lot of words (Washington=Warshington) which are thought to be descended from scots-irish dialect\n\nLike you pointed out it\u2019s distant, but the legacy of descent is still present and in a young nation people are quick to try to relate to that legacy. Which leads to overly eager people claiming they\u2019re Irish or Italian which leads to even more cringe over here, I.e., people who \u201cItalian\u201d saying you have to try their family spaghetti recipe which is just noodles from a packet and sauce from a can.",

Everyone here knows you\u2019re American (assumedly), and a topic of conversation is often \u201cwhat are you\u201d, meaning where are you descended from. Because we all know what we\u2019re talking about, we say \u201cI\u2019m Irish\u201d \u201cI\u2019m German\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Dutch\u201d and try to jokingly (or somewhat seriously If you think it actually matters to claim a relationship to a far removed past) embody traits of that culture. If you\u2019re going to a bar with your friends and bragging about how much you can drink, someone will most definitely say \u201cI\u2019m Irish, I can drink you all under the table\u201d even though they aren\u2019t remotely Irish besides their great great great great great great grandparent. Occasional WWII jokes for people with stereotypical German last names, joke about someone who says they\u2019re Swedish being blond even though they maybe had 1 Swedish ancestor, jokes about Italians liking pizza/spaghetti or being a stereotypical NYC Italian trope even if they\u2019re far removed, etc etc etc. For most people it\u2019s a way of boosting their individuality and personality by setting them apart from other generic Americans, you\u2019re not *just* an American you\u2019re a Irish-American or German-American, and that *has* to mean something /s\n\nI think that when we go over seas we still think it\u2019s novel even though it\u2019s utterly mundane for you, and from what I hear people will amp up their \u201cheritage\u201d since they\u2019re in the place they have heard so much about being from. What do Americans know about the Irish? They like Guinness and hate English people according to everything they\u2019ve heard, so they amp it up whenever they are in a bar and taking to an Englishman. \n\nNobody in the US is 100% anything, I say \u201cI\u2019m Irish\u201d but I also have English, Scottish, Dutch, and polish heritage too, there\u2019s no real reason for me to pick Irish over any of the others besides that my family associated with it.\n\nAmerica is mundane to Americans, they want to connect to European cultures",

The rest of the world has that, too. That doesn't change that many people have lines about this stuff, and around people whose stance you don't know, it'll quite often go over very poorly. Which does make me question to what extent you were actually impacted by this and aware of 9/11 when it was actually happening.\n\nThere is also that trying to say \"well, it's funny except for in New York\" sorta misses the point. The Troubles had over 3,000 deaths in an area that's currently less than 2 million people. New York City, depending on how you think about it, is something like 8-20 million people. So saying that it's okay unless you're in NYC is basically saying if you're not where it happened, people don't care which isn't making the point you think it is, anymore than if you could point out that Italians had no problem with Irish car bombs. You've ended up saying it doesn't bother people if they weren't effected by it.\n\nThere's times and places for things if you have the emotional maturity for that; it doesn't preclude black humor, just requires knowing what places it is or isn't okay.",

The pro-treaty IRA became the national army (which became the defence forces). The defeated anti-treaty remnants continued to use the name IRA as they engaged in occasional (failed) guerilla campaigns.\n\nDuring the onset of the troubles in Northern Ireland there was a split over several key issues (abstentionisn, whether to move from defending Catholic areas to an offensive campaign, whether to align with far left groups). Some members left the \"official\" IRA and formed a \"provisional\" splinter IRA which then became the dominant faction, despite the name.\n\nIn 1986 abstentionisn was debated again, and caused another split, the \"continuity\" IRA who claim the provos are illegitimate and they are the true inheritors of the republican tradition.\n\nThen in 1997 when the (provisional) IRA agreed a ceasefire during peace negotiations another group formed who refused to disarm. They call themselves \"the IRA\" but at other times the \"real\" or \"new\" IRA because of the confusion with other groups.",

It was named because of the way the shot looks as it mixes with the pint.~~\n\n~~As for why the name hasn't changed since~~, \\[Edit: I've seen several dates for the origin of this drink since, from 1971-1976-1979. I remember seeing these on cocktail menus before Star Wars came out, so I know 1979 is wrong, but will concede that I'm not sure that it was invented before 1972.\\]\n\n\\[I also still don't see why I should care any more that it exists than I do that there are cocktails named Kamikaze, Isis, Hurricane, Bushwhacker, Jeffrey Dahmer, etc... A cocktail name is not a show of support or political statement. I don't see why I should care, or what makes an Irish Car Bomb special in this regard. Especially not an entire ocean removed from events.\n\nMy point still stands.\\]\n\n...we should all know by now that bars have no chill, as there literally are drinks named after Kamikaze and 9/11 in addition to plenty of other stupidly inappropriate names. Cocktails have historically always been like that.\n\nFor example, a Paul Walker is an Irish Car Bomb with a shot of Fireball. I am not making that up.\n\nAt any rate, the cupcake is named after a popular cocktail and is made using the liquors used to make the drink. I don't think the baker really cared to be bothered with any details beyond that.\n\nNor do I think they should really have to. I get not wanting to serve something like that in Ireland and respect any bar's decision to not do so or rename it, but don't see why anyone else really needs to be bothered about it.\n\nI wouldn't expect a bar in NY City to serve a \"9/11\" or \"Flaming Twin Towers\" cocktail, but if I went into a bar in Belfast that was serving a drink like that I wouldn't complain about it, and might even order one if it seemed interesting.\n\nI also expect that at best I would just be asked to leave even if I did complain.\n\nI have enough self awareness that I realize that not everyone else in the world gives a shit about 9/11 the way an American might because they have their own regional issues to deal with, and I don't have a problem with that.",

Saying you're Irish when you're not is meaningless outside of the US for more reasons than you aren't Irish. Clearly these people have no idea of what they're talking about. Example: do you know where the Celts came from? The answer isnt Ireland, Scotland, Wales, anything that simple. They travelled to these areas themselves from, I believe, the Middle East. Now, to claim you're Irish/German/Greek/Italian-American is fine - the culture is entirely hyphenated-American, though. The traditions Irish Americans, for example, have are not the traditions of the Irish. In fact, Ireland is NOT the same place as it was, say, 40 years ago. Ireland is a place of love and acceptance. Irish-Americans - the vocal ones - do NOT demonstrate this; they're usually referring to immigrants as \"invaders\", hell-bent on spreading bull like the slave thing. Recently seen one person excitedly share the papers they found on when their ancestor was \"sold\" to become a slave. What the paper ACTUALLY said was \"apprentice\". The person in question travelled to America, paying their way by taking on a 4-year apprenticeship, but the hyphenated Americand call that \"slavery\".\n\nIt isn't about not understanding American culture; we laugh at them because they refuse to accept they're wrong.",

The fact that I and A TON of other Americans (including lots of black Americans) only even heard of the Tulsa Massacre after the event played a role in The Watchmen TV series, a fucking comic book sequel... it's despicable. I was in college in a course specifically about racism in education before I had ever heard the story of John Punch, the first officially recognized African slave in the Americas and the bullshit reason behind that enslavement. There are dozens of historical matters we went over in that class that had never been so much as mentioned in any of my history classes throughout primary school and even in my American history course in college that largely focused on the Civil War. It's bonkers.",

The sad truth here, Stonewall was kinda racist and very much transphobic. It was mostly white gays that started the stonewall riot. Queer PoC came together with them against the cops despite how Stonewall treated them which I think shows how mature and great the Queer PoC were without having to lie about what they did just so you can remove gays and whites from the conversation.",

The Fire Department couldn't get anywhere near there.   \nAnd ascribing the motives as racist when Philly had a black mayor at the time is laughable.

The depth and breadth of the Atlantic slave trade is astonishing. *Hundreds* of years of Portuguese, British, and other colonial naval powers capturing West Africans, keeping them in abject filth in \"holding ships\" off the coast for a few months, transferring them to ocean-crossing ships, making the crossing, and selling them to slave markets in the \"New World\". \n\nMany many generations born into slavery after each individual capture and crossing. Generational ripples of the crushing impact of such a disgusting and barbaric practice, driven by opportunistic greed and misguided morals. And the worst part is it's been *barely a hot minute* since American slavery ended (though a strong argument can be made for different types of bondage -- primarily economic such as 'wage slavery'). Literally thousands of years of human history are filled with the wealthy and powerful enslaving the poor and weak.\n\nIt was not / is not a uniquely American thing but American slavery (rightly) gets a lot of attention.",

In part because the bar/club/whatever need a license to sell alcohol, and that license only covers selling for the purposes of consumption on location. In part because you have different tax rates on products taken home and products consumed on location. In both cases the place selling is liable for the crime, so they have an incentive to be pretty strict. \n\nI also think you generally need to serve food in order to get a license to serve alcohol, so no pure bars in Sweden. They need to at least have some token tacos or chicken wings or whatever on a menu. \n\nOh, most municipalities also have bans against drinking alcohol in public, outside places serving it obviously. Lund is one of a handful cities that still allow it, probably because it hosts a pretty big university full of thirsty students. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I\u2019m sorry but that last comment has confused me a bit.\n\nDurp, that was just supposed to be a lame joke.

That is thoroughly surprising to me.\n\nNope. 3 of the requirements to get a license for serving alcohol are (roughly translated):    \n\\-There must be enough seatings available for food consumption    \n\\-There must be a dedicated kitchen directly attached, which must be in use    \n\\-There must be a varied selection of cooked food. The selection must be adequate and available.\n\nBut like I said, you can get around this with a fairly bare-bones menu of typical bar-grub. And I'm pretty sure some places have like a kitchen in the middle, and then a restaurant to one side and a bar to the other, all in the same open space, and sort of get around it that way. \n\nAll of this is essentially a relic from the 1920s. Much like the US had a booze-problem and then prohibition, so too did we have booze-problems and repression. Our approach was to set up a state-run monopoly (systembolaget), and assign each individual a maximum ration they could purchase. Where prohibition failed, our approach has more or less survived to this day. And people seem to be mostly fine with it. The rationing went away in '55 though, so that part is long gone.\n\nI now realize I should note that beer and other beverages below 3.5 vol.% in alcohol can be bought in regular stores by anyone over 18.  \n\n\nI also thought of another, somewhat darker, tidbit for you: in 1971, we made legal the possession and distribution of child pornography. Needless to say it was not the smartest thing ever, and it has resulted in some pretty bizarre situations even to this day. The situation was reeled in a bit in 1980, but for a brief period Sweden was a major hub in the international supply chain of such filth.",

They were just paid poorly and had no real other alternatives than to work dangerous jobs like blowing up paths for train tracks with dynamite bc no one else wanted to risk blowing their limbs off\n\nAnyways I dont really have a point just wanted to share that while the irish have certainly been oppressed and have a lot to be mad about, even in the us, they still had rights, and werent considered 3/5th of a person as a \u201ccompromise\u201d between having human rights and being viewed as a a farm tool",

They usually go through the country, like \u201cI\u2019m Nigerian American, or South African American. I never remember the name but I have met someone being so specific even down to their tribe. But what I\u2019m saying is I\u2019m not. I\u2019m hyphenated, I\u2019m not first, second, or third generation, not even fifth. I am just and simply American. \n\nLike, it\u2019s like someone going \u201cyou\u2019re from South Carolina right?\u201d And I go \u201cno, I was born in NJ\u201d \u201cbut your grandma was born in South Carolina right? So, you\u2019re from South Carolina, that makes you a South Carolinian.\u201d \n\nLike, it\u2019s that. But worse because I have a people going \u201cI don\u2019t think reparations are an issue.

And Africans come here all the time and they\u2019re doctors and they make money and they don\u2019t have an issue.\u201d\n\nLike, no, I\u2019m an American, one that had a family forced to live as animals (and lower than that) for the sake of some lazy rich assholes. And when they got their freedom they were greeted with the hyphenated name as if they made the choice to be here. As if they choose slavery. As if they weren\u2019t set back hundreds of years in the \u201cland of the free.\u201d\n\nSo, I know it isn\u2019t *JUST* a surface level thing. The issue is that it\u2019s more of an insult than it is just a simple label. Or, at least to me it is. \n\nI\u2019m a black American, I\u2019m too far removed that continent to even pretend I\u2019m hyphenated. And it\u2019s annoying I\u2019m forced to be labeled that by my government. Especially since they\u2019ve failed me and other blacks for the last hundred years. \n\nSorry, that was a tangent\u2026",

          "text": "Every thing you're saying is totally fair. But for another way of seeing it, I'd like to add some context on the term. 'African-American' as a term is very new, very interesting, and very related to the bullshit of the video. It wasn't created to refer to African immigrants.\n\nIt's quite typical in Canada and America to use terns like 'Italian-American' or 'Italian-American'. This is because they're a unique cultural and ethnic grouping with a unique history, heritage, and values. It's a meaningful category that gives its members a sense of community and identity. \n\nDuring the later half of the 20th century, study began to be done on the effects of cultural genocide, colonialism, and slavery. The effects of \"cultural disintegration\" began to be understood in their profound and lasting severity. Without shared language or roots, marginalized communities almost always fall prey to atomization. \n\nThe problem is that the descendents of slaves lack, by design, the specifics of their history. Their languages, faiths, nationalities, cultures, names, etc,... we're violently eradicated. So organizing political movements or nation-building couldn't be done on its own terms with pride; it had to be organized solely on the terms of race and skin colour which was the language of the oppression. \n\nSo in the 80's many black liberation, black nationalism, and black Civil rights movements began to consciously use and proliferate the term African-American to provide the same unifying sense of history and continuity that white people take for granted. It was intended to instruct that your story and history did not start or end with the capture and brutalization of your family, but that you are heir to countless cultures-- an African diaspora. It was a sort of pan-african move.\n\nBut when the term leaves you feeling that it diminishes or othererizes your Americaness, it has obviously failed to connect with you. I just wanted to clarify that that was not its original intention.",

I don\u2019t know much any of them. I know they got some cool mythology that isn\u2019t tapped on in Hollywood, but that\u2019s about it. But \u201cAfrican American\u201d is no more distinct than me saying \u201cAsian American.\u201d That covers countries upon countries. Cultures upon cultures. \n\nYou do realize it was by hard detective work that people even figured out their Nigerian or whatever country from Africa they came up until dna testing was made more publicly available? The culture I grew up and experienced was one made through centuries of oppression, slavery, and activism. Only a handful are from African culture or pay respects to it. \n\nThis idea that \u201cit\u2019s self hatred to not accept African American\u201d is super short sighted. I am not first, second, third, forth, or fifth generation Nigerian, Algerian, or whatever other AFRICAN country. My mom isn\u2019t first, second, third, forth, or fifth.

But for reasons\u00b9 of which I was blissfully unaware it is called a Half & Half in Ireland (and possibly the UK).\n#\n\nWe were in the UK (where I now live...but this was 15 years ago) on holiday. I think we may have actually been in Scotland at the time. Anyway we were on a hike with friends and found a gorgeous little pub. I asked the barman if he could make a Black & Tan. He gave me a slightly startled look before saying he didn't know what that was. I explained what it was and how you made it, but said \"But don't worry, I'll just have a pint of Guinness please.\"\n#\n\nA few minutes later he dropped off a free pint at my table. A Black & Tan he's tried to make himself for the first time. The split wasn't very clean (it was mostly black) but he wanted me to have it. \n#\n\nIn hindsight I think he recognised the stupid American was saying things without knowing their meaning and took pity. \n\n#\n\n\u00b9 *However, the name \"Black and Tan\" is not used in\u00a0Ireland\u00a0as a term for a mixture of two beers. The drink is instead referred to as a\u00a0half and half. In Ireland, the term \"black and tan\" is associated with the\u00a0Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force, nicknamed the \"Black and Tans\", which was sent into Ireland in the early 1920s during the\u00a0Irish War of Independence\u00a0and resulted in violent outbreaks between the forces and the Irish people* [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_Tan]",

Irish and Italians and Blacks were all considered at some point \"non-white.\"  There's a reason places like New Orleans have an Irish/Italian day with parades.  There's a reason that Columbus day was created - to tie Italians to \"WASP America\" after the brutal lynching of 12 innocent Italian men by a white mob.  Many of the Civil War conscripts were Irish immigrants who couldn't afford to buy a Commutation... going from famine in Ireland, off the boat, and straight into forced conscription in the US.  There's a reason that the Irish had to seek out employment in high-risk, low-pay work like fire and police, hence the strong ties between police traditions and Irish ones in Boston and New York.  \n\nNo, the Irish American experience is not the same as the Irish experience nor the experience of Black America.   BUT... all of them share a common root in oppression by white, wealthy, gentry, Anglo-Saxon men.  \n\nSources:\n\n * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_14,_1891_New_Orleans_lynchings\n * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_Nothing\n * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrollment_Act\n * https://www.history.com/news/how-stereotypes-of-the-irish-evolved-from-criminals-to-cops",

I have family and friends who immigrated to western countries for the sake of assimilation and their kids still consider themselves fully Moroccan. I am indeed thinking about going to Canada and possibly raising my kids there. Their experiences will not be the same obviously but they will be learning the language and the cultural customs. We have a very interesting relationship with our foreign diaspora, most come at least yearly to see their families even second and third generations and their kids are treated the same as any other and consider themselves moroccan even when they aren't able to speak Arabic (most people speak french here and most young folks speak english) so communication is rarely a problem. We even have a number of second generation people come back to stay in Morocco (which im not gonna pretend I understand but more power to them) I don't think you'll be able to really understand how it is unless you experience it. We're very proud and attached to our roots and it's woven into our way of raising our kids. \n\nAlso why is it immigrating to Khaleej for example and raising your children there is seen as lesser in assimilation than going to Canada? Anywhere you go to and raise your kids in should be seen as an opportunity to learn the customs and assimilate with the locals to have a more easy relationship. I honestly find it quite disrespectful when I see the French and Spanish immigrants in my country not even try to learn the language or assimilate to our customs while we're supposed to do so when we go to their countries. Are our cultures less important because we're former colonies? The only immigrants I'm usually able to get along with are the Americans and Canadians cause they are always interested in learning the language even when I'm able to speak theirs. A",

You can't tell if someone was raised in Canada and not Morocco? ofc you can. Maybe it's purely because Morocco is highly homogenous. When you say 'Moroccan' perhaps you're thinking of ethnicity, when I say British it's a nationality.\n\n>Also why is it immigrating to Khaleej for example and raising your children there is seen as lesser in assimilation than going to Canada?\n\nBecause there is no immigrating to the Khaleej, there is no pathway to citizenship and not possibility of ever becoming a local. They are highly diverse countries but everyone identifies as their home country/passport wtv because they are expats, with no option of immigrating.\n\n>I honestly find it quite disrespectful when I see the French and Spanish immigrants in my country not even try to learn the language or assimilate to our customs while we're supposed to do so when we go to their countries. Are our cultures less important because we're former colonies?\n\nI would agree to an extent if they are persuing Moroccan passports (are many french and Spanish doing this? wouldn't most of them just be expatriate workers?) - is there not a requirement for them to speak Arabic for citizenship? Also, this is not hypocrisy, plenty of people in western countries say this exact thing about immigrants *'why don't they learn our language, why can't they assimilate to our customs'*, this is now seen as quite an intolerant thing to say. So you wish to go to Canada, maintain your culture, still identify as Moroccan but want full assimilation of French and Spanish, lol.",

              "text": "So the term British Isles is disliked in Ireland because it refers to the islands of Britain and Ireland in a way that implies Ireland is a part of / should be ruled by Britain.\n\nThis is very intentional. The term, as we know it today, was first created by a man named John Dee, a member of the court of Queen Elizabeth 1st, alongside the terms \"British Empire\" and \"British Ocean\", the latter referring to the north Atlantic. Dee proposed the adoption of these terms to establish British right to rule its overseas territories & traid routes and to \"encourage native cultures and identities to give way to a unified sense of britishness under the queen\". (As a side note, Dee is a fascinating individual who, amongst other things, was thought to be the queens personal practitioner of black magic)\n\nThe term while the term British Empire stuck around, the terms British Isles & British ocean did not enter common use at all when they were first proposed. It wasnt untill the debates in the English houses of parliament in the mid 19th century on if Ireland should have a modicum of self governance or remain directly ruled by London that the term \"British isles\" started being widely used by politicians & papers opposed to Irish self governence, to try and evoke an emotional response to the \"breaking up of the British isles\". It was from here that the term entered common use as it is today.\n\nSo given this historical context of how the term British isles was expressly created with the intention of erasing Irish identity and the term itself  has been used as an argument for complete british/English rule in Ireland,  I'd hope you can see why allot of Irish people dislike its use",

The name \u012aweri\u016b eventually developed into the  name \u00c8ire, the Irish language name for Ireland.\n\nSo even the Roman's referred to Ireland as Ireland, completly separate to Britain.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernia",

But he uses a different name for both in a later work..\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protohistory_of_Ireland\n\nAs you\u2019ve pointed out Hibernia is used beforehand, as well as others before that and after too.\n\nIn some searches I found the collection of islands to sometimes be called derivatives of \u201cBritain\u201d but even sometimes in those cases the isle of Ireland is referred to by other names with Britannia for Great Britain.\n\nSo at the end of the day it seems to be a case of an eventual picking and choosing of names. Not too surprising when someone wants to justify ownership. \n\nPersonally I quite like Albion over Great Britain as a name",

      "text": "I think a big issue with Americans that do stuff like this is that they dont seem to understand that American-Irish is a distinct culture to true Irish. \n\nI believe that it's possible to be in america and celebrate your heritage and ancestors without being a hypocrite or \"fake\". The problem comes when they have blood as the only connection to their heritage. How can you claim to be part of a culture if you dont know its history, participate in its celebrations or holidays, continue traditions, make the food, ect. \n\nExcluding the highly comsumerized holidays and traditions (st. Patrick's day, ect.), what do you celebrate and how? What do you hold as a moral value because of your heritage? Are you part of a community that embraces that culture? How do you keep the culture alive? \n\nAnd as seen in the video, heritage can be used as a tool to create distance between the past and yourself. The comment at the beginning of the video was making a statement about racial discrimination. The person in the video claimed to be Irish to\n\n 1) distant themselves from the past (e.g. I'm irish not American. Americans were the ones who did slavery, so your statement doesn't include me.) \n\n 2) create a false equivalence (e.g. my ancestors had it as bad/worse than yours, so the fact that you are discriminated against cant be used as a justification or is not a problem). \n\nObviously not everyone who takes a weird pride in a heritage/culture they dont maintain is like this, but it's fairly common. America has a way of assimilating people where culture has to be actively maintained. Obviously its hard to keep a culture alive when you're surrounded by a different culture. And sometimes your culture changes. \n\nTake the Texas germans for example. A culture and dialect of German that evolved and developed, separate from true German, in Texas that is kept alive by the members if that community. The result of german settlers making efforts to keep their culture alive. They recognize they're diffrent from true germans, but understand their heritage and take pride in their unique culture.",

Just because it isn't as old, doesn't mean it isn't there.\n\nBut I was OBSESSED with Native Americans as a kid. I still adore it, but I distance myself from anything cultural at all because I don't want to step on anyone's toes. I'd really like to go see the area that my great grandfathers tribe's (he was half) reservation is on though.\n\nActually... I'd really like to explore and celebrate other cultures (Respectfully of course) but the lines between appreciation and appropriation are so blurred, I don't know what way is up anymore. So... Admittedly I kinda just stopped doing research on other cultures all together, other than what I happen across here and there. I would get too excited about wanting to see the celebrations in person and all, and how beautiful the casual clothes were.\n\nIt's kinda messed up actually... I was only researching \"white people\" cultures, because I can explore them. \ud83d\ude05 I realized I was doing that after my friend invited me to an event a while ago, it turned out to be a French event, but I asked her what culture it was. I asked her because I would have said no if it was a Mexican, Native, Indian, anything \"non-white\". Why? Because I would feel like I'm invading their space.\n\nSo all this time I was spending trying to be more socially conscious, because I don't want to hurt anyone, I ended up just being more ignorant about other cultures. \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 \n\nSorry that went off in a random direction.

My grandmother won't talk about it. Her and her siblings endured a lot growing up and I think it's just painful for her.\n\nMy great grandfather (great granmas husband) was an Irish immigrant and basically threw his heritage to the trash. We still don't know the story behind that one. \n\nSometimes it's not due to being fake and claiming a heritage but bc the information wasn't provided. \n\nI look more Irish than Cherokee. Only thing that gives it away is bone structure and extra nerves in my jaw that's distinct to Native Americans and Samoans. Which I only discovered from my dentist a couple of yrs ago.",

Most Irish slaves were indentured servants, which is a type of slavery, just with a end date (though a lot of the time these end dates were ignored). Chattel slavery is objectively worse than indentured servitude, but that doesn\u2019t make indentured servitude any less terrible. As far as I know, there weren\u2019t any Irish slaves in what would become the US, they were sent to the Caribbean (Montserrat is a famous example of this). There are very few descendants of these people, because most of them died of sunstroke and similar things (pale Irish skin did not go well with working all day on a plantation), which was one of the reasons the British moved to using African slaves. In the Americas, Irish slavery happened for a few decades, African slavery happened for hundreds of years.                               \nA fun fact to end this not so fun comment: The Jamaican accent we all know and love comes from a mix of many accents, which includes that of those Irish slaves.

What about their children? Over time, their connection to their home country will dwindle. Maybe they'll be more Irish-American than Irish, and eventually more American than that. It feels like a very \"blurry\" thing too, with no strict definition, and it's probably different for everybody.\n\nI'm Canadian, and I have Irish ancestors too. But it was like 7 or 8 generations ago. Once you get that far, it doesn't count for much. I don't have family in Ireland anymore, and everything I know about the country came off the back of a box of Lucky Charms. And my Irish heritage is vastly overshadowed by my French heritage too. I'm more French than Irish. I could see it being different if your Irish family only ever married fellow Irish people.\n\nIn my case I just say I'm Canadian. My family has been in Canada for hundreds of years, that's just who I am. Culturally, I have more in common with other Canadians than anybody else, so it feels right.",

So like I don't think you have to live in said country to be from said county as long as you're raised with the culture. \n\nLike for example Conan O'Brien is a perfect example of an actual Irish American guy. His family takes great pride in their cultural background and only mingled with other Irish people to the point where he's 100% Irish per his DNA test, he's still Irish American rather than just American or just Irish and he doesn't seem to pretend that he knows more about being Irish than those living there.",

Drinking Guinness doesn't make you Irish. Hating on the British (which also includes plenty of Irish and obviously Northern-Irish) doesn't make you Irish. Hell, celebrating Saint Patrick's Day in the USA with all the green is aggressively American.\n\nThe funny thing is that if these people where to seriously study Gaelige, Ireland's complicated religious and cultural history, and why the term \"British Isles\" is so upsetting, they could \"join the club\" as it where, but for most it's just to substitute a personality. They're so hung-up on the real (or imagined) hardships the Irish went through to make themselves feel like they're part of this underdog story, rather than relate to the dynamic and young Republic of Ireland of today.",

In reality, you're boring, predictable, and have no interests I can't find in a GPT2 Cali-girl Tinder profile, yet here you are trying to make a random person feel bad. You're repellent. My aim is only to point out to others not to be like you: my interlocutor is always a lost cause, and you're no exception.\n\n**EDIT**: Little queenie linked my comment elsewhere rather than reply herself. Hopefully her friends can make her feel better about herself so she doesn't feel the need to shame people for their immutable characteristics like others did to her in the past.",

Indentured servitude *is* a form of slavery by any modern definition and the UN convention on slavery. It's important to differentiate between forms of slavery, but to trivialise one form of slavery and attempt to deny it as such is completely different (which is what you and many others here seem to be doing).\n\nThere was also penal servitude for Irish prisoners, which is worse than indentured servitude and closer to your \"definition\" of slavery.\n\n Sure the \"laws\" of the British empire at the time didn't consider it slavery, but why would they be your standard? If that's the case then you'd be denying the existence modern slavery too.\n\n>A relatively small number of Irish, when compared to Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade,\n\nThat's a bit of a silly comparison, you're comparing an entire continent to a single country. Relative to population it was not a small number at all.\n\nThis type of \"gatekeeping\" that you Americans partake in when it comes to ethnicity/ ancestry really rubs me the wrong way. It's not a competition. There were Africans who were in indentured servitude and indigenous Americans in penal servitude, but something tells me you wouldn't make a point of belittling their grief if they complained about their ancestors being slaves in that context.",

We have some people who call themselves \"Irish-Australian\" or \"Italian-Australian\" or whatever, they acknowledge their ancestry but always connect it back to being Australian, because that's what they are. But most immigrants here will just call themselves \"Australian\", especially if they weren't through the trouble of getting citizenship, gives them a sense of place, belonging, and community.\n\nLike my ancestry, besides boring British stuff, is Swiss, but I've never once claimed to be Swiss. I still have a(n obscure) Swiss surname, but that doesn't make me Swiss. I'm Australian, I was born here, my parents were here, their parents were born here.

It's still very much American, just with Chinese influences.\n\nThe guy in the video is claiming he is Irish, and then talks as though he is some sort of authority on the culture he has a tenuous connection to. That I hate. It's arrogance, which is so often typified by Americans, but yes it is not unique to Americans.",

That means you are FORCED to work for them. \n\nAs I said before, it\u2019s wrong to compare the two cases above, but that doesn\u2019t mean our treatment wasn\u2019t slave-like for a time period. \n\nYou seem to think there\u2019s a single definition, but it\u2019s a broad heading. Here\u2019s a comparison to help explain it to you: Racism can be verbally berating someone (the Irish experience), but it can also be lynching someone (the African experience). Lynching is obviously far more severe than name-calling, but they\u2019re both still racism.",

The Irish were more enslaved on the fact they were conquered or raided by another country. And while African slavery started out like that, it kind almost quickly devolved solely on the basis on skin color. White people could still be slaves but at that point in American history, they had more rights than black people and were more rare. \n\nAt least that\u2019s what I read/learned.

Ether by Vikings or put into \u201cslave labor\u201d by the English\n\nTbf everyone was at some point enslaved and slaver, slavery just ends up seen through the American prism which I find problematic\n\nSlavery of some hue is something practically every branch of humanity invented everywhere we went. Chattel slavery is obviously the worst example but you had the old Irish legal practice punishing criminals with indentured servitude, the slave raids of the Nuosu people in 20th century China, the well educated slave soldiers of Fatimid Egypt known as the Mamluks etc etc. but the nuance is lost on people.\n\nI'm part of a bunch of subreddits on here where whenever someone discusses slavery (worldbuilding, Morrowind, fallout etc) it immediately goes to anger and moral outrage at any depiction of it, which is valid but misses the point that even if something is morally wrong it doesn't stop it existing, and suppressing discussion of the topic is not a solution. We still have a massive slavery problem, their are arguably more slaves now than there ever have been in history, they're just invisible to most of us.\n\nAll the other stuff you've said is accurate to my knowledge.\n\nAs for more/less rights I think someone tried to correct me on the 3/5 compromise at some point saying that indentured servants didn't count as a person for the purposes of the compromise (iirc they did count) which I suppose is whatever new way crazy Irish Americans are trying to hold up as idk a virtue or something? Also ironically the people actually native to the Americas counted as 0 people for the compromise\n\nOverall the whole thing is fucking stupid, none of us need to be comparing what our ancestors did/went through with the ancestors of others because we're not them. Life is hard enough without carrying that kind of weight around with you",

Irish people were also sold into slavery during this period as well.\n \nIrish people somewhat were involved during the African slave trade movement, but to nowhere near the same extent. They were also sold into servitude in the British colonies. What this meant was that they were forced into being servants after agreeing to a contract, stating their master would provide passage to the free world after seven years of servitude, usually granting them property or land at the end, and their treatment varied, with some being treated so badly they died before finishing the contracted servitude, and others lived a fairly normal life. \n\nThe key factor in the differences between the African slaves and the Indentured Irish servants were that the Irish were technically seen as humans under the eyes of the law, Africans were not. The treatment of the African slaves is not even in the same ballpark as the treatment of the servants. African slaves were brutalized and were seen as actual animals. It\u2019s tough to even think about.\n\nMy point being, No real Irish person will ever bring this argument up, as the thought of undermining another races more severe oppression by highlighting our own, is ridiculous,it is NOT a competition.\n\nI\u2019ve found the only people who bring these arguments up are white racist Americans who claim Irish heritage.\n\nTL;dr\n\nSome facts were misleading. Over 1000 years ago Irish people were slaves and also owned slaves.\n\nIrish people were sold into servitude during the slave trade, but were usually treated nowhere nearly as horrifically as the African people, so the comparison is ridiculous.",

Mostly it's harmless, we get it and we don't mind. I find most Irish people are delighted when people are genuinely curious about our culture. \n\nWhat we HATE is when claims to Irishness are tied up with racist bullshit like the Irish slave myth. Having Irish suffering weaponised to minimise the horrors and legacy of the African slave trade in the US and elsewhere absolutely boils our piss. \n\n> Years wasted on Irish dance.

The Irish guy in this video even arguably made an error, so it's not like you need to be perfect in your Irishness to enjoy Irish culture or be curious about your ancestry.

You're arguing that slavery with an end-date is better than never-ending slavery. They're both slavery. They're both so far over my moral redline any difference is immaterial.\n\n\"The Irish slave myth\" <- If you're taking about the American white supremacist narrative, that's not the same thing. It's a fact, documented by the people who did it, that under Cromwell about 50,000 Irish subjugates and POWs were sold into \"forced indentured servitude\". There are two racist false narratives built on top of this fact: the one you're probably referring to (\"racism doesn't exist in the US because whites were slaves too\") and the racist white apologist one in the video (\"we didn't do slavery to other whites we did 'forced indentured servitude'\").\n\nI don't know how many Irish were sold under Cromwell to colonies that are now the US (I think most ended up in the Caribbean), but even if all 50,000 had ended up in the US that's a tiny number compared to the millions of African and Native American people trafficked in US territory, but it's still not a competition for which is better. All slavery is bad. I don't really care about the slavers' reasoning or justifications. Sex slaves \"age out\" of slavery. That's not something I consider in  my opinion on sex slavery.\n\nLet me ask you this: Do you believe black Americans would be better off today if their enslaved ancestors had been freed after 7 years? Me, I don't believe they would. Racists don't care about anything deeper than \"I see a black person\". I believe the condition black Americans find themselves in today is the same whether they're the descendant of a free black person in the North or a slave in the South, or more recent African immigrants.",

Was it grim, miserable and unethical? Yes. But it doesn't compare with the slave trade and it's not unique to the Irish by any means. It's rarely mentioned in Ireland and certainly not crowed by people trying to equate their ancestors suffering to the African slaves. Why do people keep bringing it up as some sort of false equivalence?",

What really drives us up the wall is the claim that 'the Irish weren't slaves'. while technically true its fucking semantics. we sere still sold as property by Cromwell to Jamaica as Involuntary Servants. We were still sold alongside the Africans as 'slaves with benefits' the only difference between slaves and involuntary servants was that we were given an allowance to buy clothes and extra provisions, we Still had no free will. Involuntary Servitude was abolished alongside 'full slavery' with the 13th amendment.  \nSure its true that afican slaves had it worse, and its true that in todays world the black population is still disadvantaged while the Irish population isn't\nBut claiming that we were never slaves implies that what we went through never happened and that is highly offensive as uncountable people were killed, dehuminized and beaten. \nClaiming the Irish weren't slaves is like claiming the holocaust wasn't about race, its \"technically\" true, but in reality it wasn't.",

We hate the British establishment and its centuries-old foreign policy of 'fuck you I'm taking your shit and calling it civilisation'.

Many European cultural groups have faced racism, including the Irish.\n\nIf you want to claim that they currently are not systemically oppressed because of their race, there is probably an argument for that. You cannot, however, claim that Irish people never faced racism.\n\nIrish immigrants to America, for example, were routinely discriminated against, bot being allowed to live in many neighborhoods or work at many businesses.\n\nThe reason many Irish had to emigrate in the first place was due to the tenant and absentee landlord system that was implemented by the English. They economically repressed the Irish through policies that ended up with a large majority of the population becoming unemployed, and the ones that had jobs were paid essentially nothing, inflicting very harsh poverty. They were seen as a bestial and barbaric people by many of the ruling elites, and there was no attempt to help them or change the systems, even though the government was acutely aware of what their laws were doing.\n\nAt the end of the day, its clear that Irish people have never faced the racism the Africans did, to claim otherwise is foolish. That does not mean that they never faced racism at all, and minimizing history is never a good thing.",

I\u2019ve never assumed my family being Irish meant I was from Ireland, it meant my family is descended from Irish immigrants and we have familial and social expectations and traditions that come along with that. \n\nYou\u2019re American now right? Not welsh or German because of your DNA? If you moved to another country would you try to preserve some of your American identity and pass it down to your kids?

I wanted to know the genetics of how I came to be. \n\nBut the first guy is 100% wrong. It's a common myth. Irish we're not slaves. Indentured servants maybe, but some even dispute that.\n\nEdit: let me clarify. Homogeneous in the sense that we do not trace our lineage and traditions to just America. Some are 1st generation, some 2nd, some are native (not going into the atrocities there) some have family who have been here since the 1600s. \n\nSo we focus on \"what are you\" because rarely do we identify as purely American because we have these small traditions that we inherited from our great grandparents, grandparents or parents.",

When broken down its a symbol to show trinities. The oldest usage identified is the triple goddesses forms (maiden-mother-crone) but it has been used for for everything from elements (water-wind-earth) to Christianity (father-son-holy spirit) to concepts like life-death-rebirth or duties like love-honor-protect. The meaning is directly tied to how its being used, where it is being used, and what material it is formed out of, hells even if it's meant as a protective charm, an invoking rune, or a holy symbol is fluid and depends on the intent of the crafter in creating it. \n\nNow did this guy consider any of the above when getting that tattoo or did he just see a symbol that was easily recognizable as Irish and he thought it looked cool and it wasn't to expensive to get as a tattoo (other Celtic Knots look awesome but their increased complexity makes them more expensive to get as tattoos). I would bet the latter (especially with how he shows it off) and I could see that being annoying to anyone who actually places value in that symbol.",

      "text": "I hate this bullshit justification for racism as much as any rational person should.  That being said, although this douche is 100% inaccurate, there is some history to Irish people being subjected to conditions very near 'slavery' by the English. But to be clear, it was definitely not on the same scale or breadth (as a social institution/economic institution) like it was in the Americas. \n\nAnd, it seems to have been mostly in the Caribbean, but to some extent in the early North American colonies and Australia.  By comparison, in Ireland itself, the treatment of the indigenous Irish by the English from the 1600s to 1900 was more akin to how the US treated Native Americans here in America as it expanded westward.\n\nWhat I am referring to is indentured servitude - essentially a non-terminable contract to provide labor for a period of years (usually 7-10) for no compensation other than food and shelter.  Contrary to what we were taught in school, Indentured servitude was, quite often, not a result of an adult person negotiating a contract for work, but often times involved children (especially girls) whose only other option might be homelessness and starvation.  It was used frequently as a sentence by English judges in Ireland or by English landlords looking to \"outsource\" their peasantry.  And, under the legal framework of the times, indentured servants were no different than slaves in terms of their rights, so they essentially suffered the same deprivations and living/working conditions. And, in some cases, the term could be extended unilaterally by the owner of the contract, making the servant bound to provide labor indefinitely. \n\nI have only come across one book that puts the research all in one place (white cargo). \nI found that book to be fairly well researched but I also recognize that it has been cited as the justification for these exact racist soles to make their justification, so take it with a grain of salt. That being said, if you research the Great Hunger in Ireland, or if you research the history of Barbados, or Jamaica you can see that there is factual support that indentured servitude was, on an individual basis, very similar to slavery in many respects. \n\n[The tie-in to Caribbean history is fascinating by the way and a great eye opener. It's largely why so many Irish surnames are found in the Caribbean.  And why Gaelige was still spoken on Montserrat through the 1800's, Jamaican language has so many Irish words, etc....]\n\nBut definitely it is no excuse for these racists to claim some right to be survivors of slavery. I would venture to guess that none of them could even name one of their Irish ancestors or even which town or county they came from...",

      "text": "I don't know about my ancestors in Ireland but I absolutely do know my father's side of the family came over as indentured servants in the 1700s.  Which by today's standards, indentured servants is slavery.  Its doing work for no pay, having little rights or less rights than the normal citizen, and having your servitude extended on whims of the master.\n\nAnd I know that after the war with Americans, British soldiers were granted land in Canada in order to convince them to stay in Canada.  And our family knows as a fact that what happened was they would burn and raze the legally granted homesteads of Irish people and give them to British soldiers, even conveniently burning the records of the legal holdings of Irish in Canada.  This happened to my family.\n\nNow I can't speak for Americans, but at the earliest opportunity **Canadians are taught we are not native to the land, that we are from some place we've never been**.  It makes sense to someone but not to me.  How can we be from some place we never been, a place we've only seen in pictures, but that's what we are taught in the schools.   Even on census and surveys here we are asked to identify our various ancestries and heritages.   So I grew up being made aware that I am not from here, I am from somewhere else, I am Irish-Scot-French-Italian-.... the only commonality is that my ancestors were all Catholic.   Despite most of family branches dating back prior to 1810.\n\nSo the Irish person in this video is also ignorant and has no idea nor understanding what its like to born elsewhere - to be denied as a native of somewhere else, and told you're from somewhere you've never been.  Growing up that way, with that psyche,  of course many will tend to embrace their connection to their ancestors' homelands.   And the truth is many customs are still practiced and shared in the new lands....there is am undeniable connection.   So don't be so ignorant and arrogantly piss on it.\n\nMy father did some genealogy for my late grandfather at one point.  One discovery was that one of our ancestors sailed from Cork to the Americas listed as **livestock** on the boat manifest - not fully human!  One of Canada's first international best sellers was Susanna Moodie's *Roughing It In the Bush* \\- and its really quite disgusting to read - she refers to Irish off the boats as animals as was the custom of the day - the book is from the 1850s!   This is a remembered part of the Irish descendants psyche in the Americas.\n\nOne of my ancestors has his shillelagh in our national museum collection.  You bet every generation goes to see it and is proud of our heritage.   Its a beautifully carved stick/club. I even named my second son after that ancestor born in Ireland who came to Canada.\n\nI also wonder if the Irish man in the video realizes Canada has had four Prime Ministers that were active members of the Orange Order.   Its not like the politics and history of Ireland stayed in Ireland - they exported the bullshit.  Fenian Brotherhoods also existed in Canada and I understand the USA as well - and were a threat to British North America with the goal of independent Irish State here - free from British rule.  Canada's forerunner and equivalent to secret service (Dominion Police) existed initially to target the Fenians in Canada.   I suspect none of this is taught to the Irish guy in the video.  Canada's only political assassination was linked to Fenians - that of Thomas D'Arcy McGee.   There is a huge cultural link and continued history in the Americas from the old world Europe - in particular among the Irish descendants.",

Most English and Irish do reside in the south coming from England and Ireland to America moving south because of the poor working conditions, in the mostly boating work north, creating farms and industrializing the south over time. The last dude is also kinda racist my grandmother on my dad's side was full blooded Irish a Roddy,  not some ancient ancestor, it was like two generations away, quit being so geaneral. Just because you have a wool sweater on doesn't mean you made it with your hands, like my and your ancestors made, you bought it from Nordstrom just like everyone else.",

These again aren't people who are willingly going. They were kidnapped, forced and shipped off for a crime that English law made up for them. Being poor in a lot of cases. He also has an aside that showed that Irish weren't the only ones who were penalized by this, but other places under English control too.\n\nBut hey, here's another one, the guy who started the whole 'myth that there are no irish slaves'[https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:20526/datastreams/CONTENT/content](https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:20526/datastreams/CONTENT/content)\n\nsee what he said? \"**They were forcibly deported from britain and ireland to the caribbean in the mid-seventeenth century** cannot be accurately described simply as slaves but as indentured servants'.\n\nSee how dishonest that whole narrative is? He acknowledges they were forcible deported. Indentured servants aren't. That's a fucking slave. Mr. Hogan is just so hesitant to use a word as it means because they're not black. He's complicit in minimizing it by saying that FORCIBLY DEPORTING TO MAKE PEOPLE WORK FOR YOU is just a servant, not a slave. Nobody there said it was chattel slavery, but alas. This is what your whole view is based on. This foagie. who is trying desperately to make sure everyone knows that black slavery is so much worse so that no other slavery can exist.\n\nDefinition of...Slave: a person who is the legal property of another and is forced to obey them.\n\nSo he describes slaves without calling them slaves. AGain nobody said they were CHATTEL slaves.\n\nI can find more later if you want. But I've done enough to pretty much disprove the 'myth of the myth of Irish slaves not existing'",

They lump people who accept their Irish American ethnicity and follow traditions their ancestors tried to preserve because they never wanted to leave their homeland but had to, were discriminated against when they got here, and needed to form communities to survive, with the guy in the video who considers his Irish American ethnicity his entire identity for whatever reason. The Irish guy in the video is right with this guy completely but the rest of the people here are talking about any American who calls themselves Irish or Italian or German or polish etc etc and calling them annoying for doing it without understanding OUR culture and how these ethnic traditions came about and why they are important to the families that continue them.",

It\u2019s Irish American when we usually say it to each other, idc if that annoys you. \n\nIt means something to us, it will always mean something to us.

If you can\u2019t understand that and choose to be annoyed by something that has absolutely nothing to do with you then I feel sorry for you and I hope you find better things to pay attention to then some people singing songs their grandmother taught them while eating recipes she wanted to pass down across an entire ocean.

And I would feel offended if someone called me \u201cAfrican American\u201d if I was \u201cblack\u201d, and born in the States. Like what because im black I must be from Africa? Is there no black people anywhere else? So now the documents have to say what Black-English, Brown-Spanish, White-German? I hate race. Cultures are arguably different so I understand that, but this arbitrary concept of people grouped by color triggers me. Like why are Asians referred to as \u201cyellow\u201d? No one is fucking yellow lol",
