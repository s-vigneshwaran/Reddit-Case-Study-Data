Scientists have argued for millenia over what is right and wrong. And some of the greatest discoveries in history were found by people who were shunned by their contemporaries as crackpots. Does that mean that I'm anti-corona vax? It doesn't mean that at all. My stance is against people trying to label others and demonize them for not agreeing. That doesn't build unity and a common goal. In fact, at the very extremes it promotes genocide which I will always stand against even if it is just the first step in that long road.\n\nSorry for the blogpost",

That \"low\" mortality rate can only be maintained as long as there is enough equipment and resources available for proper treatment of all severely affected patients. If the hospitals get flooded with COVID patients, which is accelerated by refusing to get vaccinated and wear masks, then people who could have been saved will die, driving up the mortality rate.\n\nYou can't just cherry pick one single statistical figure and ignore all other contributing factors, it's not that simple.  \nThen again, I'm pretty sure you're aware of that and just trying to mislead others (and maybe even yourself).\n\nFinally:\n>Also, the deaths per capita isn't the infection fatality rate. How fucking stupid are you?\n\nI never mentioned infection fatality rate, you did.

And one third of those ICU patients were vaccinated. Meanwhile the aging politicians who are telling us to freak out are most affected by the disease and least affected by the economic implications of a lockdown.\n\nThere were multiple crises, every time the was a new wave. And each time people live you claimed they were isolated incidents, yet somehow they keep happening.  \nAlso, there are almost 3 times as many vaccinated people as unvaccinated, yet they make up barely a third of the hospitalizations. Now go on and rack your brain real hard to figure out how much more unlikely is is to be hospitalized when vaccinated...\n\n>To get to the post-Covid phase we'll have to kill off all the boomers. It's not just necessary, but economically desirable.\n\nNot even gonna bother with idiotic statements like these.\n\n>Also, if you whine about cursing one more time, I'm gonna shit down your neck cooffag.\n\nI wasn't whining, I was pointing out how you had to resort to cursing because you're too stupid and misinformed to bring actual arguments, which you have just proven.

And not only health; our financial stability, our possessions like cars or houses; I can\u2019t count the amount of videos where I see someone drive straight into another person, objectively their fault, and their first instinct is to blame than take responsibility for their mistake.\n\nAnd to me, that is our real crisis; when shit hits the fan, who will take responsibility for our safety and longevity? Look at the track record for our politicians and megacorpo\u2019s and tell me that you trust them to protect you and your family when it is no longer profitable for them. We need to learn how to be diligent in protecting ourselves again before we can attempt to protect others the way that we have been. \n\nGo out in public less if you want to minimize your risk of COVID; you have a responsibility to your own life no matter how inconvenient it might be, just as how unvaccinated individuals must compromise on their health in what they see as an attempt to be responsible for themselves. I encourage thinking for yourself; I just hope that they don\u2019t needlessly hurt anyone in the process. \n\nI appreciate your effort to understand before blaming; I thing we would be farther along by now if more thought in the manner that you do.",

You actually think they can just cut years of testing down to months and no shortcuts were taken?\n\n>The mechanism of mRNA vaccines have been known for a while so what are you scared of?\n\nNot scared, don't recall saying I was, I'm fully vaxxed, because my personal decision was that the risks were minimal. But you understand that there are people dying from the vaccines? There are people getting blood clots and having limbs amputated from the vaccines? If someone believes that they are at more risk from the vaccine than the virus why should they get it?",

I totally agree, obviously I'm on the \"other\" side of the fence than you on this issue writ large, but I appreciate you acknowledging that hospitalisations and deaths are the most important (and almost exclusive) issue. My \"camp\" has been saying this all along, and personally I've always maintained that vulnerable populations should use whatever means are available to them to prevent serious disease, including vaccination.\n\n2. The claim is correct, you can fact check me if you'd like but be warned they make it a pain in the arse to find these statistics and I can't be arsed to find the pdf right now. Your points are still valid. Ontario is quite a densely populated area, and the vaccinated have been out and about at bars/restaurants/gyms/etc, whereas the unvaxxed are pretty much limited to private gatherings / grocery stores. The data for the other provinces does not show the same higher case count per 100k yet (as far as I know) but it's certainly trending that way across the whole country, and it's fair to expect those rates will converge in the following months. Would you agree that this evidence casts some serious doubt on the efficacy/necessity of vaccine passports, especially considering the costs - community cohesion, faith in institutions, vaccine hesitancy etc?\n\nI also think it's fair to assume that Omicron is much less severe than the previous strains given the data we have, especially South Africa & the UK. The \"it's too soon to say\" stance is still somewhat reasonable and even prudent, but I think that's becoming less true with every passing day,",

Ex: masks in grocery stores = muzzles or the dumb vaccine 5g stuff. But it\u2019s always important to separate the batshit from the normal, on my side as well (ex: tRump is personally responsible for every covid death, like what??). But yeah, hospitalizations and vaccines are most important. The infectivity and cases are important to keep track of though ofc.\n\n2.\tI wasn\u2019t fully onboard with vaccine passports to begin with. Didn\u2019t violently oppose it either though. I kinda see both sides of the argument, we already mandate vaccines for school/college, and it\u2019s within the society\u2019s best interest to limit spread, simply because of the possibility of worse strains, and economic repercussions of portions being too sick to work for a few days/week, or dying. and it kinda makes sense that a place like NYC, which was hit hard during the original months, would make a mandate to try to stop that from happening. \n\nAtm, I don\u2019t think vaccine passports are permanently sustainable, simply because covid has become endemic. In another 2 years, they might need to change what counts as fully vaccinated, simply because the strains have changed. If a job required a flu shot, and up to date tetanus, they don\u2019t care that you got one 12 years ago. We\u2019re already seeing the beginning with a small handful of areas (I don\u2019t even think in the US though?) now requiring boosters for full immunity. With any hope, Future strains get less severe. This is something we must keep a close eye on. At some point, most Americans are either going to be exposed and have natural immunity, be vaccinated (and still maybe have natural immunity), or you succumbed to it long ago.",

Just like other communicable diseases, getting a vaccine isn't going to save everyone all the time. The important thing about vaccines are that they severely reduce transmission to other people. If 1000 people have Covid and each person with Covid transmits the disease to 1.2 people, in 10 generations over 6000 people will have Covid. If instead everyone got vaccinated and the vaccine only worked enough to reduce the transmission rate to 0.8 people, after 10 generations only about 100 people would have it. This would be a very weak vaccine, but even that would be enough to completely end the pandemic. It has worked with measles and polio in the past. We didn't have people freaking out because \"Oh now they recommend 4 polio shots! I might as well just not have my kid get the vaccine because of one doesn't work 100% of the time, they're better off dying from polio.\"\n\nAnyway, flu shots aren't mandatory because the flu is a lot less dangerous than Covid. The flu kills roughly 25,000 Americans per year. Covid has killed over 800,000 Americans in under two years, even after very severe measures taken to prevent it. It's pretty clear why one of these vaccines is more important for everyone to get than the other.\n\nAnd the 99% survival rate is pretty meaningless. In the US it's about 98%, but that would still mean that if everyone could only get Covid once (many get it multiple times) that 7 million Americans would die. On top of that around 100 million could have long lasting health problems from Covid. And on top of that we know that the biggest issue with Covid are the problems that it causes for others. A world where we do no Covid prevention results in hospitals being full and people who need medical attention unable to get seen. This could make Covid deaths 5 times higher. Other people who need to be seen for wounds, heart attacks, strokes, or mental health issues could die or sustain other long-lasting medical issues because they're not seen in a timely manner. Seriously dude, wanting society to go this route just makes you a complete piece of shit.",

Sure, it\u2019s always good to have a healthy scoop of skepticism, but it\u2019s been out for a year, no mass infertility, or brain tumors or whatever the fuck you think happens when you get the vax. The only reason people resist the vaccine is to lie to themselves that they have some semblance of freedom and control in their life. Sad ngl",

Very few beds are currently occupied for patients with COVID. Which does include patients that are in the hospitals for non-COVID reasons. There is no threat of the hospitals being overrun. Actually, there hasn't been in all of 2021 at least according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins.\n\n> If your personal choice is so important to you and you get sick, stay the fuck home.\n\nActually, that's great advice to the people that fear COVID so much that they don't think their vaccination will protect them despite serious hospitalization or death being incredibly unlikely after being vaccinated. Not only am I vaccinated, but I'm young. There's absolutely zero reason for someone like me to stay home. My parents are getting up there in the years and are also vaccinated and also have absolutely zero reason to stay home. You on the other hand... Might need another year. My brother certainly does. I doubt I'll see him for at least another 6 months due to his newly acquired, COVID induced psychological condition. It's time we *actually* follow the science instead of squawking it in fear. The vaccine works. You're safe. Quit trying to coerce people into making medical decisions they're not comfortable with. That's their problem. Not mine. Not yours. And frankly it's none of your business.\n\n> sign a waiver stating you forfeit your right to medical care\n\nYou'd need to repeal Obamacare first. This is kind of an integral part of it, you know? Being unable to refuse insurance to people that do deliberately make riskier choices is baked into law now.",

Very few beds are currently occupied for patients with COVID.\n\nIn hospitals in my state, most of the intensive cares are filled with Covid positive, unvaccinated patients. Every hospital gets ONE patient per day to send to one of the specialty rehab facilities that are trained to take patients that need their amount of respiratory support. It sucks because not only do they need the medical resources, when they are done, they need the rehab after the hospitalization and they are bottle-necking the system there too. So not only are they preventing people from getting admitted when they are deathly ill, they are preventing people from going home by delaying their discharges.",

It almost happened to several states here in the US, but we had lockdowns, masks and social distancing to thank for slowing transmission and preventing it.

It reups your resistance to severe illness and death. It does not prevent you from getting sick. Gibraltar is having to lock down from massive outbreaks despite being fully vaccinated. New York only lets the vaccinated into public places now but has some of the highest rates of spread in the country.\n\n> You are more contagious if you're unvaxxed. \n\nThat's straight up misinformation. You are sick for a shorter duration, but your viral load is equal to unvaccinated individuals.\n\n> And hospitalisation may be the primary concern for omicron\n\nEnglish hospitalizations are extremely low right now. They're about 900 right now. In October they were about 900. Between July and September they were about 800. In January they were at 3.8k, for reference. I mean, we all know the NHS isn't nearly as robust as the US medical system, but BoJo isn't following the science and is just freaking out because he got caught with his pants down.\n\n> Jesus these antivax talking points were old a year ago.\n\nIs it antivax to tout the high efficacy of the vaccine? My whole argument is that they're extremely effective and that you have an opt-out and thus don't have to care about what the unvaxxed are up to. Also, I'm vaccinated so I guess antivax is just a pejorative without meaning.",

In fact with the risk of myocarditis elevated in young men it could even be better to get the coof than the vax since the effects of myocarditis are likely permanent\n\nIt isn't hyperbole. Going off global deaths, there have been 238 million cases and 4.82 million deaths. That's 2% death rate overall. [There have been almost 9 billion doses of Covid vaccines given.](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/#global) I'm going to be wildly uncharitable and say that there are not even 500 confirmed deaths due to Covid vaccination (there is almost certainly far less than that). That's a 5.55555556e-8 death rate. So the vaccine has a death rate 0.00000277777x of the virus.\n\nYour chances of myocarditis are higher with the virus than the vaccine. [Myocarditis occurs in about 0.146% of Covid patients.](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7035e5.htm) [It occurs 0.00213% of vaccinated people.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2110737) [Covid is also showing that it can have pretty significant long term health effects.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-long-term-effects/art-20490351)\n\n> That's outright false.\n\n[No, it isn't.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2106757)\n\nIt's getting really old fighting the Joe Rogan talking points and misinformation. *And* you just cited some dude's blog lmao.",

Use the actual numbers.\n\nWith [241 million Americans having received one vaccination](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations?country=~USA),\n\nAnd [20,622 deaths reported after vaccination](https://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?TABLE=ON&GROUP1=AGE&EVENTS=ON&VAX=COVID19&DIED=Yes)\n\nThat's a .0085925% chance of death, and .06632% chance of serious injury. Admittedly that's pretty low. However given the underreporting of events to VAERS and unwillingness of medical staff to report vaccine injuries, these numbers are certainly higher. No matter what, it's definitely not a \"5.55555556e-8 death rate\". \n\nSo my point stands - you're continuing to spout hyperbole.\n\n> And you just cited some dude's blog\n\nAn evolutionary biologist's blog - not that that should matter, I don't need to appeal to authority to make the case. His data is sound, as is his math, and his conclusion is valid based on his evidence-supported premises. You're committing the [genetic fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy).",

But the COVID vaccines really aren't effective at preventing transmission for delta or omicron because the spike protein on them is fairly different. The COVID vaccine is what you call a \"leaky vaccine.\" Plenty of vaccines for animal diseases are leaky. If they were to make a new vaccine based on omicron it would likely be very good at preventing infection of it and similar strains.\n\nThis lines up pretty well with the real world data we have on COVID spreading just as quickly through heavily vaccinated populations as it does in very unvaccinated ones. Virtually no cases left are of the original alpha variant or of similar strains. Honestly, you shouldn't be worried about this because if you're vaccinated yourself you're just going to get a cold if you catch COVID. There's really no need to be concerned with someone else's vaccination status except if you personally care about their health.",

If that\u2019s seriously what you think the Covid statistics are after all this time, you\u2019re a massive r-slur. \n\nIt actually amazes me that not everyone knows the fatality rate even after being deluged with Covid nonsense constantly. It\u2019s even sadder what polls show people think the hospitalization rate is of KNOWN cases, but it\u2019s more excusable since that info is extremely hard to find.\n\nI\u2019m vaccinated but holy shit, the amount of people who go trolling around to spread their fear porn or satiate their inferiority complex against easy targets online is disgusting.",

Specialization is how human society has gotten as far as it has today so to ignore it is kind of ridiculous.\n\nI have antivaxxer friends and the only legitimate excuse I can accept from them is that they want to wait and see if there are side effects first, but when they complain that they can't attend venues which require vaccination or their friends don't want to hang out with them, I have no sympathy.\n\nIt doesn't take a lot to understand how a virus replicates through society and a vaccine prevents reproduction. Maybe we're getting to the point where people are too young to have played that Pandemic flash game but it gives a pretty good idea how they interact and how important population-wide acceptance is important to prevent both replication but also mutation of the virus.\n\nPersonally I think we should have started executing everyone who got the virus back in Feb 2019 and closing the borders. Obviously there are humanitarian and economic problems with that but we would have ended up with a lot less dead people than we have now. And we could just let all the antivaxxers get the virus and execute them so we don't have to worry about them any more.",
