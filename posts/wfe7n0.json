                  "text": "You have a lot to learn about how feminists treat heterosexual rape of males. Feminists actively block acknowledgment of males being heterosexual rape victims, support services for them, and laws to protect raped men and boys.\n\n\n\nFor statistical reporting, rape has been carefully defined as forced *penetration of the victim* in most of the world. Please listen to this feminist professor Mary P Koss explain that a woman raping a man isn't rape. Hear her explain in her own voice just a few years ago - https://clyp.it/uckbtczn.  I encourage you to listen to what she is saying.  (Really.  Listen to it! Think about it from a man's perspective.)\n\nShe is considered the foremost expert on sexual violence in the US.  **She is the one that started the 1 in 4 American college women is sexually assaulted myth by counting all sorts of things the \"victims\" didn't.**  A man misinterpreting a situation going in for a kiss and then backing off when she pulls back, puts up her hand, or turns her cheek is counted as a sexual assault on a woman even if she doesn't think it was.  **As you hear in her own words the woman's studies professor and trusted expert that literally wrote the book on measuring prevalence of sexual violence does not call a woman drugging and riding a man bareback rape ... or even label it sexual assault ... it is merely \"unwanted contact\"** \n\nYou see she has been saying this for decades **and** was instrumental in creating the methodologies most (including the US and many other government agencies around the world) use for gathering rape statistics.  E.g. \n\nDetecting the Scope of Rape : A Review of Prevalence Research Methods. Author: Mary P. Koss. Journal of Interpersonal Violence Volume: 8 Issue: 2 Dated: (**June 1993**) Page: 206\n\n> > > Although consideration of male victims is within the scope of the legal statutes, **it is important to restrict the term rape to instances where male victims were penetrated by offenders. It is inappropriate to consider as a rape victim a man who engages in unwanted sexual intercourse with a woman.**\n\nSrc: http://boysmeneducation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Koss-1993-Detecting-the-Scope-of-Rape-a-review-of-prevalence-research-methods-see-p.-206-last-paragraph.pdf\n\nShe is an advisor to the CDC, FBI, Congress, and researchers around the world and promoting the idea that men cannot be raped by women.  There **was** a proposal to explicitly include forced envelopment in the latest FBI update to the definition of rape but after a closed door meeting with her and N.O.W. lobbiests, it mysteriously disappeared.  She has many many followers and fellow researchers that follow her methodology and quote her studies.  That is where most people get the idea rape is just a man on woman crime.  Men are fairly rarely penetrated and it is almost always by another man.\n\nMost people talking about sexual violence refer to the \"rape\" (penetrated) numbers as influenced by Mary Koss's methodologies, but in the US the CDC also gathered the data for \"made to penetrate\" (enveloped) in the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2015 NISVS studies.\n\nAs an example lets look at the 2011 survey numbers:\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6308a1.htm\n\n> **an estimated 1.6% of women (or approximately 1.9 million women) were raped in the 12 months before taking the survey**\n\nand\n\n> The case count for men reporting rape in the preceding 12 months was too small to produce a statistically reliable prevalence estimate.\n\nvs\n\n> **an estimated 1.7% of men were made to penetrate a perpetrator in the 12 months preceding the survey**\n\nand \n\n> Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetrators\n**For female rape victims, an estimated 99.0% had only male perpetrators**. In addition, an estimated 94.7% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape had only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence experienced. **The majority of male rape victims (an estimated 79.3%) had only male perpetrators**. For three of the **other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims had only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (an estimated 82.6%)**, sexual coercion (an estimated 80.0%),\n\nSo if made to penetrate happens each year as much as rape then by most people's assumed definition of rape then men are half of rape victims.  **If 99% of rapists are men and 83% of \"made to penetrators\" are women ... then an estimated 42% of the perpetrators of nonconsensual sex in 2011 were women.**\n\nBut since made to penetrate is not rape, the narrative is that men are rapists and women are victims and boys/men that are victims are victims of men. Therefore most of the gender studies folks create programs to teach men not to rape (e.g. slash r slash science/comments/3rmapx/science_ama_series_im_laura_salazar_associate/).  Therefore there is justification for having gendered rape support services which means almost none for males victimized by females.  **These misleading stats are ammo to tell men to shut up about rape because 1 in 5 women are raped vs \"only\" 1 in 71 men** and dismiss raped men because men are one group \"nearly all the men were raped by other men\" so somehow raped men are to blame because they are men...\n\nAnd before you think that was just one study, it wasn't.  The prior year numbers have been really close between the sexes most years.\n\n\n2010 survey results - \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/cdc_nisvs_ipv_report_2013_v17_single_a.pdf\n\n2012 survey results -\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS-StateReportBook.pdf\n\n2015 survey results - \nhttps://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf\n\nScientific American - https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/sexual-victimization-by-women-is-more-common-than-previously-known\n\n*data revealed that over one year, men and women were equally likely to experience nonconsensual sex, and most male victims reported female perpetrators. Over their lifetime, 79 percent of men who were \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d someone else (a form of rape, in the view of most researchers) reported female perpetrators. Likewise, most men who experienced sexual coercion and unwanted sexual contact had female perpetrators.*\n\nAnd non CDC study...\n\n*A recent study of youth found, strikingly, that females comprise 48 percent of those who self-reported committing rape or attempted rape at age 18-19.*\n\nThe Atlantic - https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/11/the-understudied-female-sexual-predator/503492/\n\nAnother non CDC study...\n\n*a 2014 study of 284 men and boys in college and high school found that 43 percent reported being sexually coerced, with the majority of coercive incidents resulting in unwanted sexual intercourse. Of them, 95 percent reported only female perpetrators.*\n\nAnd another non CDC study...\n\n*National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions found in a sample of 43,000 adults little difference in the sex of self-reported sexual perpetrators. Of those who affirmed that they had \u2018ever forced someone to have sex with you against their will,\u2019 43.6 percent were female and 56.4 percent were male.\u201d*\n\nTime - http://time.com/3393442/cdc-rape-numbers\n\n*when asked about experiences in the last 12 months, men reported being \u201cmade to penetrate\u201d\u2014either by physical force or due to intoxication\u2014at virtually the same rates as women reported rape (both 1.1 percent in 2010, and 1.7 and 1.6 respectively in 2011).*\n\n\nIf my information is not enough, try reading these five threads by problem_redditor with lots more studies and references.\n\nslash r slash MensRights/comments/oc2yp0/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/\n\nJust maybe, rape isn't a gendered issue and we should stop treating it like one.  But if we acknowledge that, then we would have to point the blame at \"rapists\", rather than \"men\".\n\nAnd it isn't just the US.  \n\nFeminists lobbied against gender neutral rape laws in India, so women are not rapists and men victimized by women are not rape victims. https://www.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms\n\nSo a woman physically forcing sex on a man is not a rape in India, but a man breaking an engagement after having sex with his fiancee is a rape.\n\nIsraeli feminists were concerned if a woman raping a man was recognized by law, a man could threaten to make false accusations against the woman after the man raped her in order to keep her from reporting. Apparently false accusations are a problem for women, so they fixed this by blocking the legislation that would have made rape a gender neutral crime.\n\nhttps://m.jpost.com/Israel/Womens-groups-Cancel-law-charging-women-with-rape\n\nNepal feminists also blocked legislation there ...\n\n> Women\u2019s rights activists had criticised the draft ordinance saying it wasn\u2019t empathetic towards the plight of the victims. They said that having a provision saying even men could be victims of rape could could further weaken the women rape victims\u2019 fight for justice.\n\nhttps://kathmandupost.com/national/2020/12/11/ordinance-amends-law-on-rape-but-fails-to-recognise-rape-of-boy-child-and-sexual-minorities\n\n**Even if you only care about women, you should still stop women from raping because the majority of men convicted of raping women were sexually violated by adult women when they were boys.**  Multiple studies in the US, UK, and Canada have shown this.  Around 10 of them cited here.\n\nhttp://empathygap.uk/?p=1993#_Toc498111528\n\nSo women not raping, and rape by women being acknowledged as traumatic and treated with compassion, would probably stop a lot of women from getting raped in the future.  That *should* matter *if* the goal is to stop women from getting raped rather than to demonize men.",

                      "text": "> Rape - Having sexual Intercourse with someone without taking their consent\n\nYour definition falls short because it does not take into consideration instances in which people are coerced into consenting to sex. According to this formulation, someone who coerces another person into consenting to sex with them by threatening a family member's life, for instance, is not raping them. \n\n___\n\n> someone who cannot give consent\n\nStatutory rape is not literal rape, if that is what you are getting at. As I stated in this sub about two months ago:\n\n> Statutory rape, by definition, does not involve the removal of autonomy, as [Wikipedia notes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_rape):\n> \n> > In common law jurisdictions, **statutory rape** is **nonforcible sexual activity** in which one of the individuals is below the age of consent . . .\n> > \n> > . . .\n> > \n> > In statutory rape, **overt force or threat is usually not present**. . . .\n> >\n> > (\"statutory rape\" bolded in original, bold added to remaining text)\n>\n> Nonforcible sexual activity lacking overt force or threat, of course, is not coerced or physically forced sexual activity\u2014it is not literal rape.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n___\n\n> Someone who is under the influence cannot give consent anymore then a person who is tied down with a rope\n\nThis is an obscenely [faulty analogy](https://www.txstate.edu/philosophy/resources/fallacy-definitions/Faulty-Analogy), which is a logical fallacy. Apropos are my comments during a similar discussion here:\n\n> >it shouldn't be called consent because both are **technically unable** to give it, it should be considered something else.\n> \n> According to what definition of \"consent\" does intoxication render one unable to give it?\n> \n> The term \"consent\" is simply defined as \"[permission for something to happen or agreement to do something](https://www.google.com/search?q=consent+definition&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS727US727&oq=consent+defi&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l2.6239j1j4&hl=en-US&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8).\" There is nothing about alcohol intoxication that makes one unable to give permission. Drunk people give permission to a wide variety of activities all the time (e.g., playing pool with friends at a bar, engaging in drunken conversation with close family at home, asking strangers at a party if they'd like to hang out). Permission given while drunk is no less \"real\" or \"valid\" than sober permission. It's still permission/consent.\n> \n> There's no need for another term for permission given while drunk. \"consent\" is perfectly suitable as it is.\n\n...and here:\n\n> > No one should be able to consent while drunk, you just can't think straight \n> \n> Even if alcohol does prevent you from thinking clearly (which isn't necessarily true), what the fuck is your point? Why should diminished cognitive faculties preclude someone from permitting others to join them in enjoyable social activities like sex? This mindlessly oft-parroted, dumbshit idea doesn't make a lick of sense.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n___\n\n> \"Women are murdered for adultery in some nations\"\n> \n> -well, akshually\n> \n> It's not murder cause it isn't against the law-\n\nThis is another bizarre strawman. I never advanced an argument even remotely resembling this.",

I mean, I personally know that I can consent to sex no matter how drunk I am, unless I'm unconscious or something. I cannot be raped simply because I am drunk, and clearly, the woman in the photo did not mean making her husband unconscious or forcing anything on him.\n\nI might, however, be a little less shy than I would otherwise be or more likely to want to have sex in the moment. That's about the only way I could be 'taken advantage of', but that does not mean I am raped. It means I am a little more willing to have fun after drinking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFood for thought: If a woman/man eats oysters and is suddenly turned on due to the aphrodisiac affects, would it be 'rape' to take advantage of the situation and initiate sex? They would obviously be more willing as they are turned on by the oysters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd before I get flamed, I'm just playing devils advocate here. I am not saying that taking advantage of a drunk person \\*can't\\* be rape, because I know some people really do pass out or lose control of their bodies and cannot consent. Taking advantage of a incapacitated person is obviously rape.\n\nI guess I'm just a little lost with the comments of people who are 'disturbed' and 'sickened'. I know this is just Reddit and people on social media love to  be up in arms over everything so they can come across as the image of perfect social justice warrior while making others look bad, but really? This lady is CLEARLY making a joke. And even if she wasn't, do you REALLY think she's raping her husband. C'mon people... loosen up. I think we all are smart enough to know she's almost certainly not.\n\nI'm with the comments saying that if the genders were reversed people would bring out the pitchforks, but maybe that has more to do with how we automatically (wrongly) assume the worst of men. Perhaps we should do better on that front too.\n\nIn the real world, most people are still quite functional when they're drinking. Most are still able to consent until they reach a certain slobbyslob drunkenness level. Every day thousands, if not millions of people around the world are getting drunk and fucking. They aren't all raping each other.\n\nAnd really... jokes. Can we learn to see jokes, take jokes, and not resort to calling people rapists for making jokes? I feel like it really waters down the word 'rape' when we throw it around for anything and everything-- even jokes that obviously are not trying to insinuate rape.",
