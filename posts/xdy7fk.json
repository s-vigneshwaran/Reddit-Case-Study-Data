  "text": "TIFU after masturbating for 6 years straight\nI (28m) started having sex in my mid teens, but stopped having sex in my early 20s, specifically after my first real relationship came to an end. I was 22. I never thought it would affect me as bad as it did for as long as it did. But from 22 until recently, I've been avoiding relationships, even casual hookups. As you can imagine, I did what most people do when they're alone and horny, I masturbated. For 6 fucking years. \n\nA few weeks ago I finally said enough is enough and decided to start dating again. After several unsuccessful dates and almost reverting back to my antisocial ways, I managed to make a connection. She was cute, funny, covered in freckles and I loved it. Towards the end of our first date we agreed to continue the fun at her place. Based on our body language, sex was definitely on the table. One of my biggest fears was cumming almost instantly due to the 6 years of zero sex. \n\nHowever, the opposite became my biggest challenge. I wasn't cumming at all. I could practically see the seasons change while I was fucking. That's how long it felt. After thrusting longer than I've ever thrusted in my life, I pulled out and apologized to my date. She seemed as relieved as I was to stop. We were both complaining about being sore. I explained my 6 year situation and made her understand that she did nothing wrong. It was all me. \n\nShe understood and said it must be \"death grip\". I never heard of it before, but when she explained it to me, it made sense. I Googled how to overcome death grip and the number one treatment plan was masturbate less. I opted for not masturbating at all and guess what? It didn't help. No money shot. I had sex with the same freckle-faced girl for 3 weeks and I think her vagina fucking hates me. Yesterday we were supposed to meet up but she called to tell me she's no longer interested in seeing me because I've made it uncomfortable for her to walk properly. \n\nI masturbated this morning just to see if I can still cum and the answer is yes. I've literally trained my dick to hate sex and now I seemed to have lost a potential girlfriend. \n\nTl;dr Avoided sex and masturbated for most of my 20s and now I'm unable to orgasm during sex and I'm losing potential relationships in the process.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**SHE CAME. HOLY FUCK. I didn't think that information was relevant until I summoned the council of female pleasure in this thread.**",

And y'know, if all the keys are fitting the locks and only one's out of place... It just takes time and effort from both of you to make each other happy, is all.\n\nI'd say give it a shot. Sex isn't always about squeezing the sausage in. Introduce toys into the bedroom, give him a handy instead, make it more about manual dexterity rather than... Seemingly extended bouts of brute force. You could be a part of helping him overcome his phallic woes.\n\nAnd I know I'm pulling a wingman here, but like... If what you've said is true, then it sounds like things can still work out.

Teach your brain that it\u2019s okay to cum while doing different things. Masturbate in different places all over your house.Once you do this regularly and it becomes easy, don\u2019t touch your dick for 3 months MINIMUM(6 is better). I know it\u2019s not going to be easy but it\u2019s the only way. Once this is done you will start to see you can cum from sex again. A long term monogamous relationship helps a lot once you\u2019re easing back into sex(she will be more understanding and monogamous sex is usually better). Never go back to porn again and you\u2019re cured!",

I call it my slut phase. I think it's fairly common.\n\nI actually met my husband on an ancient site geared less toward (but not entirely excluding) casual hookups and more towards finding friends or relationships known as planetout.com. Of course it took me five years to wear him down enough to date me exclusively, and the country another 12 years to make marriage an option, but here we are.",

By your own admission that you avoided relationships for 6 years because of the mental toll of the first breakup took on you. I would venture to guess you are a person that is very much affected by attachments and emotional connections. This is probably not all \"death grip.\"\n\nYou were initially worried about your performance and probably psyched yourself out. You also could have even been subconsciously worrying about all the possibilities of what goes on with the future relationship with this new person and even possibility of a future heartache/breakup. Compound that with 'death grip' and you couldn't finish. Now you are stuck in a feedback loop.  \nSex is also not just penetration. She could have given you a hand job just so you could finish and then you could have worked together to get to a point where you could finish from penetration. Communication is key and you are already naked and vulnerable with this person so why worry about not talking about stuff!",

It relieves my stress because I'm not worried she is having a bad time, and I am also very aroused by her getting pleasure so hearing her moan and making her cum puts me back in the mood. Plus she isn't complaining, she loves that solution.",

OP, don\u2019t stress about the finish line, focus on enjoying the journey in the moment! \n\nAnyone can practice mindfulness and grounding in a non sexual way too! \n\nMy favorite way: have a piece of fruit (or your favorite food), and engage all of your senses! \n\n- *look at it*. A peach, for example, is fuzzy and you can see the texture on its surface when you look closely. Look at the different patches of color. What color is it inside? Does the color change around the pit? \n- *smell it.* can you smell the peach before you bite into it? Describe it to yourself, then again after you bite it. \n- *touch it.* can you feel the fuzzy texture? What\u2019s it like? Is it juicy, firm, or soft? Does it dimple when you press your fingers into it? \n- *taste it.* and list adjectives about what it tastes like. Is it sweet? Sour? Mild? Floral? Does the flavor change as you chew it? \n- *listen.* what does it sound like when you bite it?\n\nWhen you practice thinking about those things, it keeps you in the moment of eating the peach. You can apply that to intimate moments too. It\u2019s a wonderful way to feel connected to your partner and the moment.",

But as the relationship went on he got more and more obsessed with being able to come from PIV and it just wasn't happening and the sex sessions would just be overwhelmingly long. I'm a gal who will happily do 3 times in a day, but if every time we so much as brush a shoulder it becomes a 45 minute to 3 hour commitment and I will be horribly sore for days afterwards... I got pavloved out of sex. Took me ages after we broke up to get over the complexes that guy gave me. I had someone come in like a minute once after he and I broke up and the guy starts apologizing and I'm like NO THAT WAS AMAZING THANK YOU",

But even when he knows it's not gonna finish him, he tends to my needs and if it gets to the point where I feel completely done then neither of us feel bad about his situation.\n\nJust keep mixing it up, and don't worry about yourself as that will make it premature or not at all.",

It's not even bad enough discomfort that it makes me show signs of it that someone else could notice.\n\nTo be fair, I've only ever been the one guy that I am, so just because it doesn't hurt for me doesn't mean it doesn't hurt for any other guys.

But your response was that no, women are not responsible for the satisfaction of the men they have sex with, because nobody should do something they don't want to do and should not be coerced into doing so. \n\nMy opinion is that if you agree to have sex with someone, you are both agreeing to communicate to make it the best you can for both of you. That is not coercion, it's part of the implicit agreement. If either partner only looks out for themselves, the other partner probably isn't going to make that agreement with them again. \n\nAnd just a heads up, if you are so drenched in toxic internet culture that you can't have a conversation without immediately jumping to accusations, you should probably step away from the platform and touch grass. But I'm not your parent.",

For gals PV may not be enough, people might need to use their hands (hello foreplay my old friend). She may not be comfortable. Etc.

If so, what you're watching can seriously rewire sexual triggers in your mind. Try laying off the porn and when you do masturbate, think back to actual sexual experiences you've had instead.\n\nAlso, sometimes you just aren't sexually compatible with someone. It does sound like you could use a bit of reframing around sex but maybe you and she just wouldn't have been the best for each other regardless. Just try to use this experience to learn from for next time. You're awfully young, you have tons of time for more experiences and to find people you connect with.",

              "text": "You're going to have to stop masturbating almost all together for a very long time. You're gonna have to take up different distraction techniques.\n\nI went through a phase where some wires got crossed in my brain and it was misinterpreting negative emotions like sadness, anger and anxiety as sexual arousal. I was masturbating *constantly* and even lost my job, not because I was jerking it on the job, but because being aroused every second of the day was very distracting. \n\nTo avoid masturbating in order to retrain your dick, you've gotta retrain your brain. When you get horny, you have to try to distract yourself with something else. Something that takes all your concentration. There's also the medication option but that's only if you have some severe addiction and distraction just truly does not help. \n\nBut be careful with medication! I had a bad effect where I was just as horny only this time no matter how long I went at it or how raw I got I couldn't cum. It was awful, and more terrifying is that that can become permanent. I'm glad I told my doctor what was happening so he took me off the pills, I probably would have killed myself otherwise. \n\nAll that said, it doesn't sound at all like You not being able to get off is the relationship killer here. It's you being an inconsiderate lover. From the way you've worded it, it sounds like you aren't even trying to get the girl off, or you're forcing her to just lie there after her big moment while you pound her into dust chasing your own. You know you have this problem and you need to take responsibility for it, and that means not treating your partners like walking fleshlights. You should probably abstain from sex all together. Now, a person who is going to be a good potential partner will understand if they suggest sex and you say \"God I really want to, but I've been single for so long, I've got death grip, so I can't come from sex right now so I'm holding off\" or something similar that makes it completely clear that it's a you issue and has nothing to do with whether you're attracted to them or not. \n\nAt that point, you can offer sex, but not sex like you've been having it. You need to get them off. You can use your mouth, fingers, toys, get them to that pinnacle and then end the night how you would normally. Or, you can have sex with them, but only keep going for a few minutes, probably 5 max, after they cum because too much after that it gets uncomfortable, and hurting your partner from sex is way worse than denying them sex altogether. Like, that girl saying that she needs to break up with you because you've made it hurt to walk is not a compliment and a huge red flag! That's a horror story she's going to tell her girlfriends probably for the rest of her life about the guy who wouldn't stop fucking her even when she was uncomfortable and in pain.\n\nGirls these days are *afraid* to tell a guy \"No\" or \"Stop\" because so many of them are being assaulted or murdered for doing so. There are girls being stabbed at school for telling their male friends they don't want to date, women being attacked in bars for rejecting the advances of drunk men, hell a woman was shot in the face because she didn't want a guy to dance with her at a concert.\n\n So it's men's responsibility now to check in with their partners and pay attention to body language as well as what they say and make sure \"do you want to keep going? We can stop, I don't mind.\" You need to make your partners feel safe to say \"Listen, I'm sorry but I'm hurting and I need to stop.\" And from your post it doesn't sound like you are doing that.",

If you\u2019re having a satisfying relationship this can still be extremely satisfying while your own member is being retrained.

              "text": "A lot of things have already been said and argument been made, but possibly this advice will help you yet:\n\nFirst, to fix your issue, you may need to adjust your view at bit. \n\n1. First and likely most importantly, sex is not about orgasm. Orgasm should not be the goal and does not need to be the end of sex. Masturbation often is about orgasm, but it does not need to be either.\n\n2. Masturbation isn't bad. Porn isn't bad. It can have affect your performance, however. If you plan on stopping masturbation or your porn viewing habits, do it out of a change in habits, but not out of shame or guild. Masturbation is extremely healthy, so don't feel ashamed.\n\n3. Most, most, most women don't reach orgasm from penetration. Most women find penetration very enjoyable, but make sure to use your hands and your mouth a lot. Her being able to reach orgasm will make sex lots more enjoyable.\n\nSo that's the mindset that you may want to repeat to yourself. Now for what you can actually do:\n\n1. When you have sex, tell her you may not be able to reach orgasm. It's you, not her. Then, do absolutely nothing to reach a climax. Focus on her body, your sensations, and make sure to use your mouth and hands on her so she may reach orgasm. Don't think jackhammer, but think salsa dancing.\n\n2. Look up \"sensate focus\". It's a method of working on sexual issues and focusses on mindfulness on the sensations that you feel. Orgasm is not the goal. You may try this method alone or (theoretically, not practically) with a licenced sex therapist.\n\n3. You may choose to watch less porn. Remember, porn isn't bad. More importantly, learn to masturbate more slowly and more sensually. Also try some sensation exercises like being mindful of your sensations in the shower. What do you feel? Is it nice? Warm, cold? If you softly stroke your upper thy, how does that feel? Etc.\n\n4. (Edit) read \"come as you are\" by Emily Nagoski. It's written mostly for women, but may help you as well.\n\n(Edit) notice that I use the word \"may\" a lot. It's your journey so you decide what works for you. And what works for you now may not work in the future. Kindness for others and for yourself is key.\n\nAny questions on the details, feel free to ask. I'll answer sooner or later. Good luck!",

              "text": "Dude you've fucked up, a bit, on multiple levels but it's going to be ok.\n\n1. **Always** make sure to give them an orgasm before you even get to the intercourse, then even if the sex is bad they still had a good time. Get good with those hands and that mouth brother.\n\n2. I've had times where I've had similarly... excessive stamina. I'm sure you realized it wasn't going to happen well before you gave up if you and her got sore, there's no shame in calling it. If it's not going to happen it's not going to happen, that's ok. Women do it all the time, sometimes it's just not going to happen. Any decent partner is going to understand. What they're not going to have patience for is you jackhammering them like you think there's gold in them there hills.\n\n3. There's no harm in not jumping straight to intercourse either: slow it down a bit and go back to making out, maybe exchanging oral, that sort of thing and ease into it. Don't skip foreplay or think it's just about the woman. If you can drag it out so long you feel like you're going to pop then your odds of finishing are obviously going to go up.\n\n4. Learn to enjoy the process and worry less about finishing, there's no shame in pulling out and popping your own cork. Just, you know, give her a heads up and ask first if you want to hit her with it, otherwise there's no reason you can't hop in the bathroom for a minute.\n\n5. Don't discount the mental aspect. Performance anxiety on it's own can be enough to ruin the fun. Now telling people not to worry about anxiety isn't particularly helpful so I'm going to suggest just being aware of it and trying to relax but know there's no shame in it. Just take things in your own time and at your own pace. I promise you if you make sure she comes first and you both enjoy the foreplay even if you have to finish yourself off it'll be a good time. It's not a competition, there's no high score, as long as everyone has fun and goes home (or not) happy it's all good.\n\n6. Giving up on masturbation should work eventually but it's not necessary. Get yourself a sex toy. I know I know people get squeemish about male sex toys, fuck 'em. There's nothing wrong with masturbation or sex toys. You want something that's doing all the gripping for you, a fleshlight or similar would be ideal. I'd suggest starting with something with an easier clean up: the quickshot (not a joke at anyone's expense that's the name of the product) has an open end and is easy to clean, Tenga makes a toy that opens in half for easy cleaning, and there are about a thousand variations of sex toy out there just keep cleaning in mind because it's probably the #1 thing that keeps guys from actually using them. Ideally you don't want to have to flip the thing inside out, scrub it, let it dry, and powder it after you're done. Normally I'd be extolling the virtues of toys with vibration but in this case you want just enough stimulation to finish so I'd avoid that. Unless you're finding the toy isn't doing the job in which case go with something with multiple settings and start on the lowest with the aim of not using that feature at all.",

After she orgasms a first time she might have a tighter grip down there and will be more sensitive as well for the following orgasms. Not sure if you're just pumping until you hurt her muscles near her pelvic area, but for me, preforming oral is always key to a good time.",

I've always had issues with cunning while wearing condoms, even the first time I had sex where I didn't cum after 3 hours of sex. The next time we didn't use one and I came as soon as I was inside of her. \n\nDeath grip isn't as common as the internet likes to claim it is.",

If refraining from jerking off isn\u2019t working try gradual progressions. \n\n\nStart by loosening your grip little by little. Then pair it with sex. If you\u2019re not gonna come during sex don\u2019t prolong it. Get your partner off then jerk off. You can make it a fun thing too. Get her excited by eating her out or from penetration then both of you finish it off with some masturbation while still being with each other. This will help build up an association with sex and cumming. I know for me a big part of the issue was, like you said, performance anxiety. Masturbation is often isolated and doesn\u2019t carry the same social pressures as sex. This may be just as big a barrier as the death grip if not more so. More than anything though don\u2019t go into sex with any expectations. Feel what you feel and if it doesn\u2019t end up in climax either you and your partner can just move on or do something that works for the both of you.",

Gives them a break and you or them or both of you might even think it's a hot change of pace. It's so much better than being this hot sore congealed lump of sweat and endless frustration.\n\nAnother favorite is laying down and having them straddle your face while you finish yourself, it's a good compromise to keep them involved and let them know they're helping you get off. \n\nIdk OP just needs to get creative? It does help to do things with a non random because they're just going to bail if it's weird before you're building any other elements to whatever the terms of the relationship are.",

Even if they're subtle, you'll hear heavier breathing and little whimpers and moans when you do it right, and nothing at all if you're doing nothing for them. Figure out what you do to make them feel good and keep replicating that. Talk and make noise, even if you think you sound like an idiot. Make them know you're enjoying it too.\n\nLastly, I have the death grip, and I've found that a masturbating cock sleeve (something like a flesh light) and lots of lube helps a lot. It's not weird, it's a tool to help you grip your dick less tightly -- with practice you will find a looser grip that still feels good and your sensitivity will come back.",

The most important change we\u2019ve made in our relationship is that it\u2019s not fair to make her responsible for my sexuality. It becomes a bit of a chore for her that she secretly resents, it isn\u2019t connecting, and it can cause her discomfort if she comes first and I\u2019m taking a while to come.\n\nSo essentially we\u2019ll just stop having sex and that means sometimes I either don\u2019t orgasm or take care of it myself and that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s basically how 60% of sex goes for most women so frankly I see no problems with a man occasionally having that same experience.\n\nAs a plus, because the obligation is gone from our sex life she is waaay more into it when she opts to surprise me with HJ or BJs. Additionally\u2026 our sex is way better. There\u2019s not any amount of stress or obligation hanging over the act anymore. We can just focus on connecting with eachother.

The good news (for your dick at least) is: She would've probably left regardless. You just gave her an easy way out. \n\nBut hey dude thats ok. Consider this: You havent had sex in 6 years. Sex takes practice. And you had none for 6 years. She was step one in rebuilding that practice. You'll get there. Just don't blame your dick for it.\n\nEdit: From your replies in this thread you seem to have good ability to reflect on things. If you make use of that I'm sure you'll come out of this a much better lover.",

Based on your other comments you seemed hyper focused on getting your orgasm. \n\nI've had issues with taking too long to cum before, but the solution? Not making a big deal out of it. \n\nFuck her properly, make her cum, and make a big deal out of the orgasm. You can even make it seem like you came if you want. Then just chill and stop. Or explore other play options. \n\nConsidering her last message was she was too uncomfortable to walk, that says you definitely didn't slow down or ease up nearly enough at her requests. \n\nIf you'd just chilled and fucked til she came and backed off and then maybe talked out some options to help you cum as well, things could have continued until you regained sensitivity. You can always go jerk off later afterwards if you want. \n\nYou were way too self focused. \n\nI'm bigger than average, and often I can last a long time. I occasionally don't have a refractory period. \n\nThis means very often I've been in a situation where I didn't cum, but it was clear she was finished. My body isn't going to get physically sore or messed up from not continuing sex in the same way hers might. So I just end it and cuddle or whatever. If I'm still horny later I can always jerk off or see if she's up for oral or something(which assuming you did your job, she's not going to blink twice over). \n\nUse this as a lesson and adjust your mindset moving forward and your next fling will be much more successful.",

Eventually things got better and i guess i retrained myself fast enough, but she told me later it made her feel bad when I couldnt finish. Like she wasnt doing it right or she couldnt make me feel good like she wasnt good enough.  Maybe thats what your girl was feeling and didnt want to go through it? Idk. Hope ya get better tho. I been where youre at and i know it sucks. Blue balled cause you cant finish and at the same time thinking theres maybe something wrong with you and desperately trying to figure it out because its actually hurting your life.

You can, after all, stop using your hand and switch to something like a fleshlight. Not only does that eliminate grip problems, but using some kind of mount or cushion prop can eliminate manual control entirely and help you get used to finishing while thrusting.\n\nThe common wisdom is to take a long break from masturbating, but IMO it's more effective to retrain yourself on something that does a better job of resembling actual penetrative sex. You can start making progress immediately instead of going cold turkey for two months and hoping everything works out.",

It must be frustrating and discouraging. Know that you are not alone and among a large number of people that are uncomfortable talking about such things. \n\nAre you open to giving oral or engaging in forms of \"outer course\"?\nSince it seems like you are experiencing additional challenges in achieving orgasm via intercourse, this kind of puts you and your partner on equal footing.\n\nI think this could be an opportunity to take care of your partner's needs first which has numerous obvious benefits. A less obvious benefit is the reduction in pressure for you to climax yourself, once your partner has already achieved climax (at least once). In my experience, a partner can enjoy a longer session after having already climaxed and in some cases can enjoy harder sex.\n\nI also wonder if you could have any success with \"taking turns\" getting each other to climax via oral or some other means. Sex might not need to start as the traditional form. Maybe you can explore multiple paths to get to the destination. The point of sex is for both partners to achieve satisfaction, so let's start there.\n\nEventually you could try sex again and have a plan for how to handle the climax part. You could discuss with your partner that, since there seems to be difficulty with climax during intercourse, that you could try pulling out and finishing on her (if she's open to it), or ask if she would be willing to help you achieve climax manually (oral or with her hands) as a finishing move of sorts.\n\nI really think your partner could be open to trying again if you communicate that you are interested in trying to find a better solution for the both of you.

Its never hurt his feelings, we've both masturbated on occasion when neither is up for going at it. Its all about what you're comfortable with and taking care of yourself.

In order to orgasm, you need to be totally in the moment and not thinking at all about when it's gonna happen. They even encourage those with the opposite of your problem to hyper focus on what they're doing and feeling as this is known to slow things down. My advice would be then to focus on enjoying sex regardless of whether you orgasm. It'll happen once you stop worrying about it happening.\n\nMost of all don't worry about this girl.

Alone you\u2019re relaxed, comfortable, in the moment, not feeling judgement or pressure, with no inhibitions or worries \u2014 all the right parasympathetic pathways firing to turn the appropriate gears. With a partner, you\u2019re worried, anxious, insecure, pressured to \u201cperform\u201d on command, and so your brain senses these stressors and fires the sympathetic neurons, aka your \u201cfight or flight\u201d system which takes blood flow to pretty much everywhere but the erectile tissue in the penis, since your dumb binary brain can\u2019t distinguish the nuance but rather just responds to the stress/anxiety.\n\nAnd beyond any possible sexual \u201cnew partner\u201d anxiety, this is the same concept with things such as depression, job/life stress, etc effecting a man\u2019s ability to get an erection. But funny enough, as you need parasympathetic activation for an erection, you need sympathetic activation for an orgasm lol",

Takes forever \n\nI recommend you continue your no-death-grip plan but the most important thing is to relax and enjoy the moment",

Also you have to switch up between penetration and other techniques.\n\nIf you and your partner are on the same page, then you'll learn to stop long before it gets tedious or painful.\n\nI went through a week like this and my partner and I fucked basically all day and night for that whole week. We took breaks, obviously, but basically the second she was horny I was good to go. It was incredible.\n\nI also strongly agree with parent: it's not death grip. The reason it's easier to jerk off than cum through penetration is because the former is just you, you're relaxed and comfortable.\n\nAs with all things the key to good sex is the closeness with your partner.

It can cause it during the refractory period, which is like 30 minutes to 2 hours for most men.  But you're not going to have any problems ejaculating Tuesday morning because you jerked off 3 times Monday.  \n\nI really wish people would talk to their doctor with these sexual concerns.  OP just says he went on google and google said it was caused by too much masturbating, and they accepted that as fact and thousands of people upvoted it and put it on the front page of Reddit.  It's medical misinformation.\n\nThey could have anxiety, they could be experiencing side effects from medication, they might need to reduce their drinking or smoking.  But masturbating isn't going to cause this.",

At that stage you just regroup and focus on her enjoyment because what else is there to do. But years of porn and beating your meat like it owes you money cannot have helped much.",

It has seemed to me that guys get more of a message that sex is something fun for them than women do. Like for women, we mostly are told to expect that sex is about the guys enjoyment, and that it\u2019s more important for them to orgasm than for us. \n\nSo like, too frequently it ends up where both parties involved think that the primary goal with sex is for the guy to cum. And when that\u2019s the case then the female partner isn\u2019t really as likely to want to stay. Not saying that this is usually anyones actual fault, I think it\u2019s more of a larger societal issue",

Sometime it may happen that my girl is going through something and though at the start she's interested and willing and maybe even she started teasing me, after a while her mind may wander and she'll have a hard time cumming. She sometimes asks me to cum cause she likes it but I don't. I really don't enjoy it. One thing is to ejaculate and running, another is cumming. And you know there are also shallower orgasms and orgasms that almost take your soul out of your buddy for a while, so the rainbow has lots of shades. Sometimes I may just cuddle with her instead cause it's frustrating to cum alone and a bit sad and I want the best for her always as she does for me!",

But that isn\u2019t the case for everyone. For some people it is a learned behavior. Not trying to suggest that either one is better, whether you have a natural inclination towards pleasuring a partner or are taught/learn how to get the most out of doing so, then you\u2019re doing great. It\u2019s just the people who don\u2019t have the natural inclination and don\u2019t learn it for whatever reason that can be an issue",

My parents didn\u2019t talk to me much about sex from what I remember, so a lot of my thoughts about sex when I was younger came from tv and movies and such. I guess \u201ctold\u201d was sort of too active and purposeful of a word. I think that in most cases sexual inequality between genders is picked up on through media and just general interactions with society than through actual explicit statements and lessons. \n\nSo like, I pretty much grew up to believe that guys (or people with penises) will want sex for pleasure and that women (or people with vaginas) won\u2019t want it as much. I didn\u2019t learn that sex can be pleasurable for women too until later (before I actually started having sex but still too late imo). And I know MANY other women who also had to retrain themselves not to believe that. \n\nAs for the orgasm thing, I didn\u2019t actually learn that female orgasms were possible until much later. Still during my highschool career but if anything I feel like I should really be aware of my own genital and sexual possibilities before anyone else\u2019s. Official sex ed and anyone with authority in my life didn\u2019t really teach me about pleasure with sex, and when they did it wasn\u2019t gone into too much detail. They never said anything about the fact that the man ejaculating does not mean sex is over. They pretty much said things along the line of \u201cman ejaculates, withdraws penis from vagina carefully and removes condom from penis, throws out condom with care not to accidentally spill semen in vaginal region of woman, then just continue on your days\u201d. \n\nI could go on for pages and pages and write a whole book on this. But my experience wasn\u2019t based on crazy religious standards or being in a less socially progressive country or just being in a super conservative environment. It\u2019s really common. \n\nI\u2019m curious what your experiences are though, since you said mine were crazy. Also if you don\u2019t mind telling me things like what area you were raised in, how old you are and just general background contributing to your sex education. I\u2019m not trying to stalk you lol, just want to know the things that contribute to sexual health knowledge",

If he can't, then that's shameful and he's not a \"real\" man.\n\nThis comes from women and men alike. Presently and for the past several decades. In person, online, everywhere. Heck, just look past the top comment in this section and you'll see no end of people placing all of the importance on his sex life on *her* orgasm and mocking OP for caring about *his*, but absolutely none of the attitude you're describing. You'll also find some people promoting a healthy middle ground of mutualism, which is cool.\n\nThe only exceptions to this rule seems to come from comically toxic douchebros. You need to go pretty far back for the attitudes you're describing to be the norm in any real way outside of niche culturally regressive areas.",

I think we should do all the things that are often called \"foreplay\" and make that the main event of the sexual encounter, because they are generally *more* enjoyable than penetration. Thinking of foreplay as a separate activity implies that it's optional, and it absolutely is not. Penetration is like cheese: It's very good, but it's most often a thing that improves the dish without being the only ingredient, and only a handful of dishes can get away with just cheese and not much else.",

The guy was using the music as his pelvic metronome. \n\nWhen he\u2019s so focused on making sex feel normal and natural to him to the point where he can\u2019t get off without listening to a very specific sex playlist that *always* included this song, it\u2019s pretty clear that he just picked a bunch of songs with a specific BPM that matched whatever the hell rhythm natural made him cum in whatever he felt was a reasonable amount of time. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to have a sex playlist of raunchy and saucy songs to set the mood, and you hit shuffle, and you quickly forget what\u2019s playing because it\u2019s more there to serve as sexy background noise than anything else. \n\nIt\u2019s another thing entirely to pretend that metronomic rhythm matching will be sexy for anybody except the person who decided it was. The guy was clearly so focused on matching his beat that his partner picked up on it even when the music wasn\u2019t playing. The guy wasn\u2019t fucking his partner, he was fucking the music.",

Just because you had no issues with sexual health as a result of excessive masturbation does not mean other people don't have issues.\n\nAnd again, nobody 'discovered' a new medical condition. They just created a colloquial term for 'excessive masturbation leading to issues ejaculating during intercourse'.\n\nI'd also like to point out that medicine is still catching up to the modern world. For most of human history, excessive masturbation to the degree we see it these days would have been extremely rare. With the rise of the internet and the easy access to porn the last few decades have brought, it is now much easier to get caught in a loop of watching porn and masturbating simply for the endorphin rush. And doing anything excessively just to get a bit of a chemical rush in your brain is not going to lead to positive outcomes.",

Aim to be an unselfish lover because someone who is selfish in bed isn't worth wasting time with.\n\nYou already know you pounded too hard the first time, and you stubbornly kept thrusting for too long the following times. It's great you were checking that she was still okay...but sex shouldn't be just \"okay\" for your partner, and it shouldn't be an ordeal for her to endure. \n\nUse lube. Seriously. Specifically, it is best to use a water-based lube that is glycerin and propylene glycol (this will keep it condom safe, silicone toy safe, and vagina safe). You cannot have long sex with enough friction to cause pain; pause for second and grab lube, it will feel better for both of you. Long sex is very fun...but only if you aren't sandpapering her vagina. USE LUBE.\n\nAlso, if PIV isn't working, move on. Take a break and go down on her. Break out some toys. Switch to mutual masturbation. Either way, taking the pressure off yourself by getting rid of this focus on PIV only *and* making sure your partner feels better than just \"okay\" is a win/win.",

      "text": "To preface what I\u2019m going to say, I\u2019m just going to admit that I am not a person with a penis, and I am never gonna pretend that I know how dicks work. They confuse the shit out of me. I\u2019ve heard of all of the fixes people have mentioned, but I absolutely do not know how it actually feels to actually have a penis and be having that problem.\n\nI would like to help you understand how to better manage dating and sex while you\u2019re figuring out how to fix this issue. I have gone a year having very regular sex with a boyfriend who never once came. That ended 6 years ago for me, for reasons completely separate from the sex, and I still am very casual friends with the guy and still have no idea what was going on on his end. So some relevant background on my experience I guess is that I was 16, he was 17, we\u2019d been dating for months, were deeply in love with eachother, and were each other\u2019s firsts. We didn\u2019t know much about what we were doing but I was basically a TA for my high schools sex Ed program so I knew a lot of the theories about how to maintain a healthy relationship and sex life. So, I tried very hard to talk about what was happening in order to fix whatever the issue was for him. He never opened up about what was going on no matter how many times I asked him questions, assured him that it was okay and not to be embarrassed, and asked/proposed specific ideas of what might help him orgasm during our sex. \n\nSo, from what I\u2019ve learned, it is perfectly possible for a woman to enjoy sex without a guy ever orgasming. Like ever. I\u2019d be fine marrying and living for decades in this situation giving certain requirements are being met to keep it from making me feel physically and mentally shitty. Male orgasm isn\u2019t a requirement for female pleasure. Just like the many times that men have sex with women even if they have 0 intention of actually making her orgasm because that\u2019s just what the patriarchy taught them, it can still be sex that both individuals enjoy even if the guy doesn\u2019t cum as well. It just involves a bit more communication and effort mostly because of the pain aspect. \n\nSo, I\u2019d suggest being honest with women before actually having intercourse about whats been going on with you. Say something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019d still like to try and I will definitely still enjoy it, but I might not be able to cum and that\u2019s fine with me. Just wanted to let you know to please tell me if/when it becomes uncomfortable for you so we can take a break or stop\u201d. If you really want to make her feel more into you, try to express how much you want her to enjoy the experience instead of making it all about your climax. And OMFG USE LUBE. I\u2019ve met many men who don\u2019t want to use lube because they think that womens vaginas are water fountains and that they can just magically be totally lubricated anytime that we\u2019d like them to be. A lot of society even makes this an expectation, and so some men think women who aren\u2019t as wet as they\u2019d like all the time are less attractive and therefore they don\u2019t want to be with a woman who wants or needs to use it anyways. Lube literally always makes the sex smoother, and less painful for a woman. Especially if you\u2019re going for longer than average periods of time. Say you\u2019re actually thrusting for an hour+ without cumming. Take a break, hopefully multiple breaks, and apply some extra lube. I\u2019m a girl who enjoys long sex. I think most do. I\u2019d love going for an hour but absolutely not without some lube breaks. If you go for this long. And do not reapply lube, her vagina will become dry, it will get painful, she will have a chafed vagina, and most likely will be incredibly unhappy with the situation afterwards. I don\u2019t know any other reasons for the girl you had sex with to be experiencing pain the way she is, unless there\u2019s additional issues on her end that you didn\u2019t mention or that she didn\u2019t tell you about, so really lube should stop women from pain if used liberally for your sexathons. \n\nThen there\u2019s the emotional reasons that this could effect women more than you realize. Basically it boils down to just communicate openly about it. Encourage her that you really don\u2019t mind stopping, that you don\u2019t  need to orgasm to enjoy your time with her, and want to make sure she feels good and is enjoying it or else you\u2019d rather stop and just try again another time. Also, idk if you\u2019d be worried about telling her that it\u2019s been an issue for you but it\u2019s way better to tell her beforehand because then she will believe that it\u2019s not her fault. If having sex with you is wrecking her sexual confidence, she probably won\u2019t want to continue. Also lots of people were basically taught that sex is about the guy cumming, and girls are frequently told that they\u2019re terrible people if they have any type of sexual experience where it doesn\u2019t result in the guy cumming. If she doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening, she will be less likely to tell you when she wants to stop, and it will become less enjoyable. She might think that it\u2019s her responsibility to give you an orgasm and if she doesn\u2019t than she\u2019s giving you \u201cblue balls\u201d which is apparently the worst thing in the world and 100% the fault of the women from what I\u2019ve heard lol. \n\nTLDR: So, overall, communicate the problem, do what you can to make sure it\u2019s comfortable physically (lube), and encourage her wholeheartedly to tell you when she wants to stop and make sure she knows stopping isn\u2019t a big deal. Honestly if you treat her well she might even enjoy the sex more than if you were able to cum.\n\nGood luck and lmk if you\u2019ve got any questions! (Feel free to dm)",

At first\u2026sometimes during \u2026 and after. There is no remedy for a huge dick. \n\nWhat you can do in such cases is start out slow and work it in to a comfortable (for her) depth. Keep things super lubed, play ur favorite fuck music, and try some dirty talk. The goal is to get her so turned on that her vagina loosens up enough to go in deeper. \n\nJust know a big dick will have you soar afterwards\u2026sometimes for days\u2026especially if ur a small woman.",

Like when my bf does something which results in me feeling hurt I struggle very hard to try to not act like a total bitch to him in response especially when I realize that he didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong and I just want to take some time to work on making sure I have realistic expectations and figuring out how to make my emotional responses more situationally appropriate. So like, if I have the choice between talk something out asap or passive aggressively act like a bitch (despite trying my best not to) until I eventually confess the entire situation as an explanation and apology for my bitchiness, I find it best to just bite the bullet and avoid the bitch stage lol. My bf is also TERRIBLE at communicating tho. Like really bad. Like in between just leaving really important information out and just flat out lying about it. I\u2019ve basically been training him to communicate openly and effectively. He\u2019s aware of what I\u2019m doing. It\u2019s kind of a humorous dynamic imo tho. Like I\u2019m a teacher irl and also acting like his personal teacher on just how to be a better human being in our relationship",

Especially if you're stressed and worried about coming, it can get in the way and make you less engorged than you might otherwise be and therefore it's a sort of reinforcing loop. I've had to stop more than a few times because it was too much for the girl and the best thing you can do is have a positive mindset about it and keep an eye out for your partners comfort and engagement. If they're just along for the ride and you can't quite make it over the hill, just call it quits and finish outside, either with the partner if they want or while you're doing the bathroom cleanup routine. The relationship is more important and you'll eventually get over whatever the block is. Just don't sweat it if every so often things don't click.",

For one thing, it seems to have been based on people's subjective personal idea of whether they have had \"problems\" with porn or not, with a specific focus on addiction. Of course people who already believe it's not causing problems will report that they have no problems. I find the author of the article's leap from the study's actual focus to \"porn is not a problem\" to be a bit much.\n\nThere are enough stories out there of people's challenges with porn -- from ones similar to this story where someone couldn't finish until they took a break from it, to couples' whose sex lives go to hell because one person seeks porn over their partner, to the [way it affects the dopamine system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4600144/) -- that I find it hard to believe there's no problem whatsoever.\n\nI will make it clear though: I'm not taking some hardline moral stance here. I'm not saying porn must have some baked in, essential component that makes it inherently bad. It could be addictive or problematic the same way anything can be addictive or problematic if over-consumed.\n\nForget citing articles at each other for a moment, and just answer this for me: If you're masturbating to porn multiple times a day, but turning your partner (who wants it!) down for sex, is that a problem?",

This is one possible explanation, but there are others too. Just pointing this out so you don't miss your own bias.\n\n>\"Dopamine\" is a red herring.

It is also a core component in most addictions. There are plenty of studies and articles out there that illustrate this, so I'll let you do your own digging, if so inclined.\n\nAnyway, I don't think we're going to get anywhere by continuing this discussion; we're clearly both stuck in our positions. I encourage you to read the study I linked, and do some open-minded research on the topic. I plan to do the same.",

The brain is malleable, and the more you do a certain thing in a certain way to get a reward, the more that pattern is reinforced in the brain. It can be literally anything.

The brain is used to the behavioural aspect of it, like taking a moment to roll, go outside, the act of holding something and taking a drag etc. If you always have a biscuit with your tea and then one day you don't have a biscuit, you'll crave one. Doesn't need to be negative either, people who frequently work out or exercise will get that itch about the time they go for their run/do their weights etc. OP has conditioned themselves so their brain has all these behavioural conditions aspects with orgasm that are nothing like real sex.",

You'll have to overcome something that you programmed into your brain for 6 years, so expect at least several month of rewiering your brain. \nWhat usually works is, obviously, less fapping, but not only that. You'll have to replace the sensation of your tight fist with the sensation of a real vagina. Which will take a whole lot of repeating.\nFor one, don't do anything sexual for a while. Let your natural sexual tension to grow. Then try having sex. Even if you don't ejaculate, relax end enjoy the moment with your partener(which is actually the most important part of sex). \nIf your partener is understanding enough and willing to put up with that then you're lucky. But as long as she feels good with you and she's not toxic there is no reason to not help you too. \nThing is... even if it sucks, resist the urge to masrurbate if a vagina can't do it. If you use condoms go for the thinnes ones for increased sensation.\nIf your partener won't put up with it and you have to deal with it alone, you can do that too, by masturbating. But you'll have to change how to do it. Forget the death grip and only use a light grip, maybe only using a few fingers, to get yourself used to something looser(also use lube or something to simulate some wetness). A fleshlight or something similar may help instead of your hand.\nGood luck! Hope you will overcome it asap\n\nEdit: spelling",

      "text": "I don't have this issue from masturbating, I just last a long time because I enjoy sex. You should start to see this as a super power; my partners do. Here's how:\n\nThe big philisophical change is understanding two things:\n\n1. Sex feels good\n2. Your orgasm means the sex stops\n\nSex stopping means she stops feeling good, you stop feeling good, etc.\n\nDoes this mean you should just fuck forever? No. This hurts for women.\n\nSo what do you do?\n\n1. Before you get intimate, let her know that you don't always cum, but it's cool because you're not orgasm focused. Yours or hers.\n\n2. Fuck in the moment. Now that you don't care if either of you cum, do a lot of foreplay, taste her, touch her, let her to you, talk dirty to her, take your time penetrating and reset whenever you need to.\n\n3. When fucking, just focus on making her feel you. Since you don't orgasm as easily as most dudes, you can really give her good penetration and really draw it out, without worrying about you.  This isn't about going hard or fast or even deep. It's just about expressing yourself on / in her body. She wants to feel full, you want to fill her. Simple.\n\n4. So learn to listen to her. Watch her breath, her body. Women are super communicative. If you learn to listen, she'll tell you exactly what she needs, and you'll make her orgasm no problem.\n\n5. Side benefit: When you're actually in the moment, you'll just randomly have an orgasm when it's good. She gets super proud because she knows it's not common with you. And, because you put her pleasure first, she won't care when it happens. She's stoked.\n\n6. Make sure you check in to ask if it's getting uncomfortable. When it does, just stop. Since you didn't orgasm, all your senses will be heightened. Take that time to cuddle, talk, touch, etc. And just enjoy each other.\n\n7. Since you have the new superpower to stay hard when you want to, now you can just enjoy those moments. THey'll be better for you and for her, and you can just do weird shit like get turned on, fuck her for a couple of strokes and then go back to the cuddle phase. This is good.\n\nLearn to dirty talk on top of this and you'll have super satisfied partners.\n\nAll this said... def stop masturbating for awhile. Reset yourself off the vice grip, because orgasms are neat. Just use this as an opportunity to realize that your orgasm isn't even the most fun part of sex for you. So don't make it a thing.",

Your just stopping the death grip which your body will still know. Second, when you do masturbate use a softer grip and if you don't use a lubricant start using one (avoid lotion as it rubs away rather quickly get actual lube and in my experience water based is 10000x better than silicone based). Thirdly, I'd recommend a Fleshlight or whatever you want to call it. It will feel similar (obviously not the exact same) and it will help with death grip because of it's more authentic feel (again you'll want lube).\n\nDo you watch porn when you masturbate? That can lead to desensitizing your mind to a naked woman which would result in less of a turn on when in the bedroom and issues finishing. Watch less porn when you masturbate, or better yet completely stop watching it and use your imagination. I watch it for just sound now and imagine the rest and it helped significantly for me.\n\nIt's not something that will be fixed in a month. It will take a few months for your body to become sensitive down there again as well as well as your mind not being so desensitized from porn. It took me about 4 months to get back to what I'd consider a good time when in the bedroom.",

It\u2019s not that bad. You\u2019re more than your dick.\n\nYeah, a lot of girls will take it personally if you can\u2019t come. That sucked but it is what it is. Before I have sex with girls I often tell them that it\u2019s hard for me to cum, so don\u2019t expect it or take it as a challenge. Every girl appreciates when I\u2019ve told them that. Some have broken up with me because of lack of sexual chemistry but more often than not they don\u2019t really care since I was up front with them.\n\nSecond, I found that going cold Turkey wasn\u2019t the way for me. Jerking off IS natural, people have always done it. Nothing wrong with it, just don\u2019t do it daily. Reserve a random weekday for it and only do it once that day a week. \n\nSecond, for me the death grip was secondary. The porn really does rot your brain, and honestly nothing in real life will be as intense as porn. That fucked with me, I was expecting it to be way more intense / erotic. \n\nSex can be awkward, it can be wholesome, it can be funny. But my fucked up head would have a hard time getting into it, because honestly with porn you usually can give it time to get mentally into it. Real life has a lot of pressures and a whole other person to concentrate on, it\u2019s way different. \n\nTHAT fucked me up a lot more. I met a girl who was porn levels of freak and she got me there every time even if I jerked it earlier in the day. This girl knew her shit though and was extra tight so it helped with the death grip a lot.\n\nTldr, relax. Your dick isn\u2019t a cum on command. A lot of girls have a hard time cumming during sex, don\u2019t know why guys are expected to fire away every time. \n\nYOU\u2019RE MORE THAN YOUR DICK. \n\nYou deserve to have sex and have a good time without having to ejaculate.\n\nGive up porn, try to jerk off once a week only and try to do it without porn. The porn itself is way more harmful than jerking it imo.\n\nYou\u2019re young, and I guarantee your issue isn\u2019t just death grip. Your expectations and experienced I guarantee make it harder for you to get lost in the sex, and that definitely makes it harder to cum. Death grip is still a great issue, but honestly one thing I found is that even if the sex was kind of meh I still usually cum now when I\u2019m straight up having a good time and are lost in the passion, instead on when I was only focusing on cumming \n\nHit me up if you have any more questions, this eventually led to ED for me and my that was way scarier until I got past it by realizing how mental all this REALLY is.",

It sounds like you were extremely nervous and stressed out about your performance before it happened, and guess what, this can cause exactly what you described. It's not always just \"Death Grip\". Sometimes you're in a bad place mentally, or you're putting too much pressure on yourself to perform, or even you aren't as attracted to your partner as much as you thought (or think you should be). \n\nYour best bet is therapy, but I know it's expensive if you don't live in a country with free healthcare... The second best bet is communication, and self reflection to try and understand what is causing the stress and how you can create a relaxing and peaceful environment for you where you aren't freaking out about whether you can perform or not. Unfortunately, new relationships aren't always great for this, unless you meet someone who is very understanding with great communication skills. In either case, I hope you can figure your stuff out. Be kind to yourself and listen to what your body is telling you.",

Most of the upvoted comments here are really terrible advice. Like you, you can desensitise your dick but unless you jerk off with sand paper, give it a few days and it\u2019ll be as good as new. People here will hate me for it but **masturbating is not bad for you and you won\u2019t destroy your dick doing so**. \n\nYour problems most likely come from your head. It\u2019s kind of incredible how many processes have to take place in your body for you to orgasm. In short and easy, your body goes into an \u201ealert state\u201c so you can have sex. You get an erection and whatnot. For you to orgasm, your body needs to leave the \u201ealert state\u201c and relax. If you can\u2019t, you won\u2019t cum. Also the reason why stress/tiredness often prevents men from climaxing.\n\nWhat you\u2019re experiencing is provably performance stress/anxiety making you unable to orgasm, because you stress so much about it. You don\u2019t feel the stress when alone, so you orgasm. \n\nHonestly? Give yourself a few days to get your head straight, when with a partner focus only on pleasuring her. Your pleasure will come eventually. Also get this in your head: **sex doesn\u2019t always have to end with orgasms**. All of the teenagers here will say that\u2019s not true, but it is. Sometimes taking part and pleasuring your partner is the everything. It\u2019s okay for you not to orgasm every time!\n\nEdit: just to expand a little, ONS are mostly terrible because good sex needs practice and communication. It\u2019s not as easy as in-out-in-out-splash-splash. Maybe she should\u2019ve done something else to get you to cum, maybe you should\u2019ve done something else. You need practice to know what you like!\nAlso a Common source of problems for men (even with average pp size, not that it particularly matters) are wrong condoms. You might\u2019ve used something too thick, too big, pinching you wrong way, too small.",

Don\u2019t get in your head about your performance \n- Keep in mind that your body may need to adjust to having sex, especially if it has been a while. Those muscles will need to be retrained, especially if you have some extra weight. \n- Make sure you are not trying to do porno moves while having sex. Those are for show and typically not that comfortable for most people \n- Ask her to get on top and put your hands on her hips to help her move. The visuals and the feeling of this combined with your relaxed posture make it really great for getting you to climax\n- Have sex preferably while sober. Getting drunk makes it way more difficult to reach climax \n- Build up having sex with her in your mind, if you like a specific girl\n- Be honest about your problem and find someone patient. It\u2019s a really good test to see if they are relationship material.",

I err on the side of experience instead of on the fantasy of deserved compassion for a problem that the OP knew existed, did one google on, and decided it would be fixed if he took an action that took literally no real effort to do. Men really need to make more of an effort to be better at sex with female partners in general, instead of women being more empathetic to the problems men cause themselves. \n\nYou read this story and think OP is the party who needs compassion, but I read this story and think the woman in this story does.

What I learned is you need to practice for what you're going to experience. So find some plastic, lube and pillows or mattress gaps to get busy with. Learn what works for you that you can use in situ with your partner. Also practice while wearing condoms, mastubate with them don't come without one until your genetles learn to come from that specific sensation. \n\nNext, sexual compatibility. You may connect with the person on all ways except you and your partners body just may not \"connect\". I dated a lot for a few years and found that what I see (Gorgeousness) or hear (smart witty funny etc) is only a portion of what will get me/us off. \n\nFocus on pleasure, not the finale. If you change the narrative from focusing on the finish to genuinely enjoying the ride you may find your partner has multiple orgasms, multiple times throughout the day while you only get off once every day or week or whatever. To some that sounds assinine to have sex without a male orgasm but holy hell you and your partner can learn to enjoy a lot of sex in snack size bites. \n\nFinally have confidence in what works for you and use that with your partner. If you gotta jerk it to cum, then jerk it! Work with your partner so they get pleasure,  but then do what you need. Pull out when she's done and you and her can work it together. This will help lead to mutual understanding of what you both need to get over the edge. \n\nHave fun and enjoy learning what works for each other. Sex is not one dimensional.",

At least until you can actually finish from sex. In that way you'll be sharing more than genitals and you both can focus on the mood and ~passion~ instead of just chasing a high. You'll connect better and you might even find yourself feeling it more. I know for me, i can finish in like 5 minutes if I'm doing it to myself, but I can't sleep with a random person, because i need to be extremely comfortable and trust the person and \"let go\" it takes a long time with a partner",

If anything, I feel like it\u2019s helped me be a better lover, since I enjoy the journey and seeing my partner feel pleasure instead of focusing on finishing myself off. \n\nJust always eat her out/finger her/etc. and make her cum first, then have sex but don\u2019t push it - usually you can tell within like 5-10 minutes whether you\u2019re actually going to cum or she\u2019s actually going to cum - if either is true, keep going; otherwise, just stop and cuddle and remind her it\u2019s just how your body is. For most women, the most pleasurable part of sex isn\u2019t penetration anyway, so it doesn\u2019t really matter. \n\nThe only slight issue I\u2019ve had have been in longer relationships when the girl really wants to make you feel that ultimate pleasure and feels like they\u2019re missing out on that experience. If that\u2019s the case, I usually just end up getting really long, enthusiastic blowjobs, I tell them I\u2019m just going to fuck the shit out of them until I cum (luckily girls I\u2019ve been with have liked the rough aspect of it), or I just incorporate masturbation into sex (e.g. after like 10 minutes of them sucking your dick, tell them to lick your balls while you stroke your cock and finish), all of which feel pretty great. \n\nObviously, every person is going to be different, so just being upfront and communicative about your feelings and checking in about hers is important. \ufffc\ufffc",

They're cool and my age and treat me like family, but there's roaches at their spot, so I tend to only stick around for a couple hours for fear of hitchhikers. \n\nI literally skate to work and come home and lay in bed and smoke D8. I hardly eat because moneys and pretty much lifelong, untreated depression. Nbd. But between the Xbox, reddit, YouTube and all the streaming services I have I'm totally fine. I've lived a crazy life that some people say I should write a book. I'll never do it because I'm a lazy POS.\n\nI just started renting out the spare room to a guy who works in a different department. He brought his gf in immediately, but that's chill too. She has tons of friends that she \"cannot wait to introduce me to\". Which is also chill. \n\nFast forward to yesterday and I am getting off of work 730a and she's got this cute girl there and we instantly click. But I've seen a woman before and sex is sex. I've had it. It's super dope and I love to fuck. But nowadays I could take it or leave it fr. ^if you think about it it's actually gross\n\nSo we are in the living room chilling out, I'm drinking and smoking as one does after work. After chatting her up for a bit, I declare it's time to kick it in my room and I'll see everyone later. Getting ready to lay down and I notice my water isn't in my room so I go through the living room to the kitchen and grab it.\n\nOTW back to the room, I stop at the couch to chat for a few. We notice her pulling her hair a bit and his GF asks what's up. Says it feels good and she could really use someone to pull it. I literally do the double finger-gun sideways towards her with smirk and a very smooth 'ayyyyye' lol.\n\nShe stands up and says let's go. \n\nUh, fr? \n\nYes. Now. \n\nI shrug and lead her to my recently picked up r/NeckbeardNests, except for all my clean clothes in a huge pile. Whatever's clever. I throw on some music and we get to it. \n\nHoly shit it was demon time. Like I'm fresh out of jail and thought I'd never have sex again. Literally the best secs I've ever had in my 36 years. I think she felt very similar because she's currently otw over. \n\nWe went to my room around noonish and after break number 3 it's apparently 6p. I never finished. She wasn't happy but I explained to her it's been a year and I've been a low-key shut in. \n\nSo Holy shit bro..not as long as you but I feel it man. I wish you luck. I might update later and I suggest you do the same! Super interested in your nut lol",

Eventually I got used to having sex with my gf and have no issues with orgasms anymore, regardless of pos. But before figuring this out, I was just not orgasming during sex, and we would just stop when either one of us got tired or sore.\n\nThat seems like common courtesy to me, jeez\u2026 guys feel really entitled to their orgasms\u2026 don\u2019t beat tf out a girl till she breaks up with you cause you have issues with your orgasms, Jesus Christ.",

That doesn\u2019t mean you need to stop masturbating.  It just means you need to stop using that type of stimulation (likely a tight grip, no lubricant).  In fact, changing the way you masturbate (using a toy or at least lubrication) will likely help you get used to different types of stimulation and get you to where you\u2019d like to be with partnered sex faster.\n\nAll of that said, there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a specific way you like to reach orgasm.  And if you\u2019re comfortable enough to have sex with someone, you should be comfortable enough to either show or tell them what that looks like.  It isn\u2019t just for your enjoyment, bringing up the topic of pleasure or what types of things you like may make your partner feel more comfortable opening up about what feels good for them.  For example, it\u2019s relatively uncommon for females bodied people to be able to reach orgasm from\npenetration alone.  Maybe that was what was making your partner\u2019s vagina \u201chate you\u201d. \n\nYou will have better sex if you involve this type of communication.",

Rather than making a frustrated effort to find someone willing to subject themselves to your kink, restrict yourself 100% to couples porn. The kind where intimacy and pleasure are the focus, not jamming big things into reluctant holes.\nYour brain will *slowly* learn.\n(I literally mean 100%- cold turkey on than nasty shit. 10 seconds of depraved twisted porn will undo hours of porn that resembles real relationships AFAIK)",

I still masturbated, but generally just when video calling my girlfriend so it wasn't analogous to watching porn. \n\nI wasn't back to my best, but I could maintain an erection more consistently and took an acceptable time to ejaculate. \n\nI've always been a fan of using my mouth, hands and toys on my girlfriend, so even when I've had penis problems it hasn't made much of a negative impact on our sex life. \n\nSo maybe try limiting porn consumption. Just my experience, but it does seem to be fairly common amongst men. \n\nI know it's different when you're with a new partner, but you could also try focusing more on oral, hands and toys.

Obviously there\u2019s gonna be an adjustment period.\n\nIn terms of what this means for sexual encounters going forward - don\u2019t give up! Sex shouldn\u2019t always need to be rough to cum and good sex doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to cum. \n\nKey to being a good sexual partner is focussing on their pleasure and if they are a good partner they will focus on yours. \n\nDon\u2019t do what I have done and let it become a source of anxiety. I have had ED for about a year now and even when I can get it up with out medication, my mind takes over and kills it, this means I have two problems to deal with. Consider yourself lucky, my ED is at the point now that I cannot cum even from masturbation, regardless my sex life is thriving because my sexual partner and I have very open communication and a fluid dynamic.\n\nAs for improving your situation - try when you masturbate from start to finish going really really slow. This helps me focus on the pleasure it self rather than the speed and building up a friction tolerance. Also suppper important is to tell ur sexual partner prior to intercourse about your struggles. People much prefer knowing what to expect prior and if they are a reasonable person they will make u feel comfortable and accomodate.\n\nGood luck on ur journey :))",

Get used to only using the Fleshlight and if you use your hands try to grip as light as the Fleshlight.\n\nIf possible, men need to stop watching porn overall.

She was super excited by that lol. We had a great 9 months together until work moved her out of state.

Which then has you going down the mental rabbit hole of \"Oh shit in lasting to long...\" stress makes ejaculating VERY difficult. Basically what OP is describing is a type of psychological ED.\n\nSource: me. I can often get in my own head causing me to last way to long. Then basically \"realize\" I'm not going to climax this time and so I don't. I've seen a doctor. And a therapist over it. I know what I'm taking about here. But there is hope.

Sometimes I'd get close but she'd have to tap out (Which is totally ok). So what we started doing was having sex until she felt uncomfortable, then I'd just jack off while kissing her and cum in her mouth in the end. That way she's still involved I suppose? An important part is explaining that having to jack myself off wasn't because I found her unattractive. In fact, being comfortable and feeling like I could do what I needed to do without feeling guilty was the sexiest thing ever. Eventually my body became more comfortable orgasming around her to the point where I could finish during sex. Hope that helps! And sorry if this comment is incredibly graphic!",

Here's a suggestion from someone who solved their death grip problem years ago and is still with the woman afterwards.\n\n1) Stop masturbating for a full week.\n\n2) Week 2 try using your non dominant hand and focusing on sensitivity more than speed. Get yourself worked up man. It's a marathon not a sprint. Enjoy the journey.\n\n3) Week 2 should still only be 2 times that week, spaced out by a few days.\n\n4) Find your triggers physically that get you going. They help more than not getting off for awhile.\n\nOh and this is all easier if you do it with your partner. Mine was understanding and worked with me to rebuild that sensitivity. It took about a month and it wasn't fun, but it worked. Maybe find Freckles or another woman and see if they'll help you fix your dead sensitivity issues.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: You killed your sensitivity. Now you have to slowly resensitize your swinger so he can feel soft touches again.",

I'm in a steady relationship and almost certainly have massive death grip from masturbating several times a day, nearly every day for years in my college years out of sheer boredom. I still fall into those habits occasionally even now. \nIt is definitely noticeable during actual sex. My gf pretty much just reads it as incredible stamina but I have to make a real effort to orgasm in most positions and it takes a while, and sometimes it just doesn't happen. However, for some reason doggystyle almost completely averts my death grip and I can cum pretty quickly after switching to that position, and it's usually how we end up once I decide I want to finish up. \n\nI think I'd just experiment more with positions, pov, different partners, and perhaps even kink/bdsm/roleplay to try and find your \"weakness\" when it comes to sex and climaxing. Think about what you like, what excites you and how you can get that out of actual sex. It isn't a coincidence that I'm a hips/ass man and prefer doggystyle for instance.\n\nI always make sure she's feeling good too so that long sessions don't end up being tedious, I think that's most important. Don't be too prideful to let her incorporate toys or whatever she needs to stay aroused. Watching porn together before sex can also help.",

As I got older it became more and more difficult, I could feel it build up but it would just disappear. If my wife and I did anything else I could climax but I just had no feeling inside of her.\n\nA lot of times people don't realize the issues that you're facing are because someone made a decision for you when you were born when they had no right to do so.",

There's only one technique when you're mutilated, and that is jackhammer. You will often see a lot of complaints as you've noted about needing lube and having to get really physically intense.\n\nI actually had a great thread a while back about the person saying that if engineers had designed sex just made it about docking and transferring fluids. We're moving on the mechanical motion. A woman had said she would have made it so that the penis adds lubrication and stimulates the clitoris. I had to give her an education on what the foreskin does and She had an epiphany.\n\nIt's really insane out here in the United States, my son is not mutilated and yet doctor visits will constantly tell me that he needs to be able to pull his foreskin back, I have to educate these pediatricians on what mail anatomy actually is and that it shouldn't retract until he reaches puberty. It's insane how many times they have claimed this could lead to phimosis. And I have to straight up ask them how can my son be diagnosed with a condition where he can no longer retract the foreskin when he's not supposed to right now?\n\nI genuinely laugh when people say how ignorant people are of female anatomy, when in reality we know a great deal. It's the mail anatomy. We are quite ignorant of especially medical doctors, at least in the United States.\n\nI also find it insanely ironic how people claim that they don't have any problems when you just start to list a few of the common basic issues that shouldn't be going on and they nod their head or their girlfriend agrees or their wife says yes. It's such a private issue. We don't talk about it and the true horrors of it thus get hidden.\n\nIt absolutely is less pleasurable, I barely have a friend you them and I twitch a little if my wife hits it, I know people who are intact who can have multiple orgasms and it's insanely infuriating.",

      "text": "Hey man just wanted to reach out to say that I went through the exact same thing. Deathgrip May also be a factor but it\u2019s most likely porn that\u2019s messing with you psychologically.\n\nI started watching porn and masturbating way before I had sex. From about 10 or 11 before I could even orgasm. I had sex from 14-22 and never ever came during sex, not once. I also had a very inconsistent erection which I just thought was normal.\n\nI beat it by abstaining from porn (soft porn and lewd images included) and masturbation for 4 months. It was honestly very difficult and that experienced made me realize that I have a porn addiction. After that 4 month period I could finally orgasm during sex, and noticed a much harder and more consistent erection. It was life changing. A lot of outlandish fetishes I had became largely unappealing as well.\n\nEssentially excessive porn and masturbation conditions our brain to associate orgasms with pornography and not physical sensation. Death grip also couples this by constant overstimulating your nerves, making them less sensitive to the sensation of penetrative sex or even oral. If you hold in orgasms to wait for certain scenes or videos for example you are contributing to this conditioning.\n\nThere\u2019s a concept called the 90-day rule which means that it takes 90 days of no porn and no masturbation to re-conditioning your brain to associate sex with orgasms. It\u2019s also recommended to lubricate your penis daily and protect your head from friction with fabric (if circumcised) in order to heal from death-grip syndrome and re-sensitize your nerves.\n\nYou can check out r/nofap for more info but please don\u2019t listen to all the delusional weirdos who talk about semen-retention and the super powers it provides. Masturbation is perfectly harmless if done in moderation and without the aid of pornography.\n\nIt\u2019s an uphill battle that gets easier with time. I\u2019ve recently relapsed and went on a 3 month long porn binge and ended up back to square one as I do have a very active porn addiction but I am currently working back to the 90 days clean once more. \n\nHope I helped!",

A man is never going to be able to perform properly in bed if he's caught up in his head and constantly worrying about how SHE feels and whether something is awkward and uncomfortable. She will communicate either verbally or nonverbally if something is uncomfortable. You don't need to explain anything. Do what feels good and focus on sharing a good time. Stop explaining everything and apologizing constantly. If you had shrugged it off and just stopped banging her after she had enough and been like \"okay that's all you get for now, you want some water?\", she wouldn't think it's weird. You don't have some weird obligation to cum wtf. Why are you just mindlessly pumping away when it isnt what either of you want? You don't gotta explain shit esp if she never mentions it and if she mentions it just be like \"I like not busting often because I can keep going for multiple rounds and find I have more energy during the day\". Your TIFU was not some masturbating or fucking her the wrong way. It's your own brain and the way you're reacting to it and worrying about it. She will feel what you feel. If nothing is wrong and you feel confident, that's what she's gonna feel. If you act like it's some problem and that you're fuckin up she's gonna be like \"welp looks like he's fuckin up! Bye!\"",

Also, after first failure its much harder and much more stressfull. So, yes, deathgrip is a thing, but pressure and stress is even bigger thing. So try to not be so hard on yourself, and maybe try to find someone who wants to be with you not only because of sex and will understand your situation more.  \n2. Sex isnt only penetration: You can have foreplay, then have some 5 min penetration, then some blowjob/giving head, or some mutual masturbating, receiving handjob and cuming that way, cum on her tits etc. There are so many options how you can make it fun for both of you, and trust me, most of the time solely penetration become boring after while, so try to experiment little bit - this will significally reduce pressure and increase fun.  \ngood luck!",

The fuck up was using her body like a fucking flesh light to the point of long lasting pain because you were focused on getting your entitled orgasm instead of the comfort and safety of your partner. Jesus Christ. \n\nSo many women have been through this. It\u2019s awful. The vagina isn\u2019t meant to be jackhammered for 10-20-30 mins like in porn. It causes *tears in the vaginal wall and even the perineum.* \n\nFor fucks sake dude imagine if a woman wanted an orgasm and her only way forward was to jam a dildo in and out of your ass for 45 minutes so she proceeded to simply do that despite your obvious discomfort *because that would be fucking uncomfortable for anyone*. Get your fucking brain into your skull instead of your dick. \n\nMOST women take a long time to achieve orgasm with a new partner, weeks and months, if ever. They don\u2019t respond to this by painfully using and abusing their partners\u2019 bodies, yet it\u2019s been *so* normalized to subject women to this. Youre not entitled to an orgasm, the fact that it seemed to be your main goal tells us all we need to know about your sexual performance. Sex isn\u2019t about jackhammering someone until you get an orgasm then it\u2019s done. It\u2019s supposed to be enjoyable the whole time regardless of climax. You\u2019re damn lucky she tried to stick with you at all. If the roles were reversed you would have fled and ghosted. If a woman had *injured you during sex in her fixation on getting an orgasm ONE time let alone repeatedly,* you\u2019d be fucking traumatized, but you think it\u2019s fine and funny to subject a woman to- like porn addicted men tend to. Get some fucking sense, and speak to a psychiatrist about exercises you can do to develop basic empathy because you clearly missed a milestone.",

If you feel like its an eternity then she probably does as well, women are more sensitive down there for this kind of thing. Consider her needs while your pounding away.. great sex lasts less than 10 minutes usually. And honestly, she probably didnt care you werent cumming, you were just hurting here every time you got down. Ive had difficulties before and every single one of my partners didnt care and asked \"did you still have fun?\". If someone wants to have sex with you they want you to be happy, so be nice and consider them. \nSecond, bruh, lay off the meat. Self gratification has a place but constant endless ringing out the cloth will leave your willy as dried up as a prune. Im a child of the 80s & 90s where the stretch Armstrong and the bendy WWF figures were all the rage. I knew this kid that played with his every day and after a while they lose their stretch/bendiness and he was all disappointed, he asked his dad to fix them and he said something to the effect of \"he went limp because you played with him every day\".. he cried, I laughed. Same concept applies.. find a reason to hold onto not slapping your monkey more than wanting to get laid because youll end up in a self  destructive loop. RIP your willy",

Just take it slow, focus solely on the woman in front of you like she is the most important thing ever and try to take in every detail of the moment - her body, the movements, her pleasure. Be 100% in the moment and dont think about what could go wrong. And try to make it as good for her as you can, don't rush. You will enjoy it too, if you see she is into it.",

You cannot masturbate no matter how l badly you want to. I\u2019m not sure if just having a lighter grip will help, from what I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s no masturbation, I\u2019d look it up. \n\nYour second option is to do all the things you usually do during sex, hands, mouth, toys and once she is satisfied masturbate with her there. Either while she\u2019s doing something to you or herself or just watching etc. If finishing is important to you right away that\u2019s you\u2019re other option but it probably won\u2019t help the not being able to cum any other way. But it\u2019s totally fine if that\u2019s what people have to do. I don\u2019t know a lot of women who like to be thrusted for long periods of time so all the other stuff is better anyways. \n\nThird option, you aren\u2019t affected by this death grip thing and you\u2019re just really nervous to be with a real person after so long and eventually it will come back once you\u2019re more comfortable. Focus on enjoying the process of sex not the orgasm and make sure she is enjoying it as well and eventually you will cum.",

I'm obviously not 100% sure because I'm not there and not in the situation, but something like that can be overcome with time and changes to how you guys have sex. Don't let it bug you too much because if she decided it wasn't going to work, then it wasn't going to work anyways. It takes two people to be committed to make a relationship work. It can't be just you that's into it or just her that's into it. And keep working on getting your feeling back so you don't rub the next girl raw lol",

Sometimes I found myself wondering if it would be rude to read a book while he did his thing (I didn't, just thought it a time or two).\n\nThe key is to change what you do. You have the combination to that particular lock down. You have a position, a grip, a bunch of little things that lead to orgasm.\n\nYou don't have to stop masterbation. Just do it differently than you normally do. Use your oppositie hand, stand rather than sit (or whatever). Put a cutoff time on masterbation. If you don't orgasm, don't worry about it. Just stop, and try again later.\n\nWith a partner, try letting them jerk you off. Again, put a cutoff time on cumming, focus your attention on giving her a good time.\n\nIt will take time, but you'll get there! Remember, it took you 6 years to get to this point, you aren't going to fix it in a day, or even a week or two.\n\nAnd a girl who likes you will be patient. Just be kind to her vagina. The goal of sex should be connecting to one another. Woman frequently don't have orgasms during sex, doesn't mean we don't like it and it's not fun.",

Don\u2019t let shame come in, that kills intimacy. Do lots of foreplay and give your dick a chance to get used to vagina again with no expectations! Don\u2019t use death grip- but I\u2019ll tell you some fits (vaginas) are better than others (find what works for you) and it\u2019s not always automatic- we expect to have mind altering sex without really knowing what works for both people. With the right person and some patience you\u2019ll get your mojo back. But don\u2019t use her. Find love if you can, but learn what works for both. I mean I haven\u2019t met a lot of women that aren\u2019t ok with having a ratio of several orgasms to their man\u2019s one. Just if it\u2019s not working try something different and work up to long lasting sex- muscles and tissue bruise! Make sure she gets hers and then rest, don\u2019t force it. It can be fun.",

Sex can still feel good even if you don't orgasm, so just let feeling good and creating a connection be the goal. With more comfort you are more likely to finish. \n\nGood luck buddy, if you and the girl have a good connection you should try to build on that rather than just letting the sexual dysfunction tear it apart.",

You expect to be able to cum and so does she so when you aren't you create a mindset that makes you unable to. The nerves of things prevent you from relaxing and properly enjoying yourself. Third, porn is problematic because it's not real. While yes, you can and people do fuck like that, it's not how everyone does, and so when you unintentionally pavlov condition your orgasm to correspond with when some chick sprays her juice or whatever, things get disconnected from the reality of the context when you would normally cum. This may not be your problem exactly but it doesn't help. \n\nGood luck my man. You've acknowledged the problem, now hopefully you can find someone who likes you enough to help.",

Sometimes, we don't even realise when we've developed this need to develop something deeper and true. \n\n2) You sorta psyched yourself into this thing cause you feel like it's abnormal for you to live off masturbation and you should \"fix\" it.

The first time he couldn\u2019t cum, but he realized this pretty early on and decided to forget about trying to orgasm himself and just focused on me. I came more times than ever before. We stopped after I started to get dizzy and I felt bad that he hadn\u2019t cum, but he reassured me that great sex isn\u2019t all about his orgasm. Lemme tell you, as a woman that statement nearly made me fall in love on the spot. \n\nThe next time went similarly but I still felt bad that I couldn\u2019t make him cum so I tried a few different things. I was worried that he didn\u2019t find me that attractive but was reassured when I realized his biggest turn on was going down on me. Anyways I was trying to give him a blowjob but he was getting softer. I guided one of his hands down and asked him to show me how he gets himself off. He was able to cum that day (much to his relief). It got easier with time but it was probably a few months of lots of great sex before he said he felt back to normal and was able to orgasm without concentrating. Oh. Also weed helped a lot. Just helps get out of your head",

You probably have 3 main issues:\n\nFirst is the \"Death grip\", meaning your dick got too used to the feel and the (probably too tight) grip of your hand. Go easier on your dick when you masturbate from now on. Also try to reduce the fapping frequency if you can, but that's secondary.\n\nPorn: If you've been masturbating to porn for 6 years with no sexual contact with actual women, then your brain is definitely out of touch with what to expect and what excites you mentally. I'd suggest dropping it for now, or at the very least shift to softcore stuff like naked pictures or short solo videos.\n\nAnxiety: Probably the biggest issue, and the most complicated to solve. I'm not sure you're anxious to come or to please your partner, but try to remember that sex is a two-people activity and enjoy the ride together, rather than race for the finish. Try to figure out what feels best for the two of you and have fun while at it. Be cool if you don't get to nut, even the Kama Sutra has a part that mentions the man should climax only in 1 out of 3 lovemaking sessions IIRC.\n\nMost of all: Be patient and compassionate with yourself. It might be a long process, but I'm sure you'll get there eventually. It took me a couple of months dating a girl to return from being a porn addicted, ED-plagued coomer back to a somewhat normal person, so talk it out with your future partners. If they're worth it, they'll understand and help out with your current condition.\n\nBest of luck, OP!",

The sex feels good but your mind is so programmed to cum to those same stimulants that you just cant.\n\nWhen u masturbate dont go to rough on yourself.

U don't, u yourself can masturbate and cum quite easily.   \nSoon after I stopped seeing this girl I had a ONS with another one.

Don\u2019t put pressure on coming and as long as your partner is enjoying themselves, it\u2019s all good. Can you cum if you masturbate right after pulling out? Or if your partner does it for you? \n\nIt might just be an issue of breaking ingrained habits and to do so you need to 1) quit jerking it (at least so often) 2) quit porn and if you do jerk it, leave the porn behind and 3) try to find a partner to is accepting of your issue. Don\u2019t rush into sex when you meet another girl (you will) and be open with her. You don\u2019t need to phrase it like you are  some sexual deviant, just say you had some bad habits that caused this problem and you\u2019re working on them and you appreciate her understanding and taking it slow.

      "text": "Good luck to you man, but as a woman reading that she toughed it out and you went until she struggled walking just breaks my heart. I don't mean that as an attack towards you, but next time you meet a gal try to be more in tune with her body and stop well before it hurts her. Your orgasm shouldn't be above a woman's health (tearing/injury down there can lead to issues). Also ensure better communication next time. She clearly struggled voicing discontent sooner and put up with the pain for you. She shouldn't have, but it happens quickly that women disregard their health for their partner's pleasure. My best friend endured her boyfriend until she repeatedly peed blood (no kidding, she had to go to a doctor cuz it wouldn't stop) because she thought that's her job as girlfriend.\n\nIt's also sad she knew more about male issues (death grip) than you. It naturally happens, but I just feel for her that she wanted to help and it came at the cost of her health, well-being, comfort and safety, and she probably thought she's supposed to be in pain to help you solve the problem you caused yourself.\n\nYou absolutely deserve sexual enjoyment so I hope that it'll get better for you and you will be able to have easy and enjoyable orgasms again, but please take it slower and make sure your path to healing isn't a path of destruction for upcoming partner(s)",

I didn\u2019t believe it would work. \n\nBut man when I had sex with the next girl. I also made sure to find a connection with her that wasn\u2019t purely sexual and had some type of connection. I waited three months. And I told her about it. She was willing to wait. \n\nWhen it happened, it was crazy. I came after maybe 30 seconds, it was like two or three pumps. And since then I can go back to back and I\u2019m well past my prime. \n\nNow sex isn\u2019t a chore anymore, it\u2019s all physical and intimate. And it fixed my issues with relationships.

Didn\u2019t jerk off for 30 days and then had sex to break it. And it still didn\u2019t work. \n\nIt could be more mental than physical. For me it was. Just gotta be more patient.

Masturbation and oral are common examples.\n\nYou need to build intimacy in your sex life. You could masturbate in front of your partner after she's done. Just make it fun for both. She needs to cum and feel good about it. Focus on what she wants and have fun so you can build confidence and grow that intimacy. Try making her come with your hand out tongue to change things a little bit for her\n\n\nOn the other hand, make it fun for you too. You can ask her to masturbate you before or after she's done. Make it part of the flow and it will become more natural.\n\nTo get out of that fixation is not easy. Imagine your partner or certain position while you are masturbating and/or get your \ud83c\udf46 inside her when you are about to come. Think on a therapist if this continues to be a problem for you.\n\nGood luck!",

I digress. I second what a lot of people have said, get out of your own head. Listen to music if you need to or engage in dirty talk. Don't think about orgasm and certainly don't think about the seasons changing. Let the girl know beforehand(consent is key and some kind of discussion should be had so let this be part of yours) and just enjoy it. Sex still feels amazing and does great things for your brain without an orgasm. Orgasms are the cherry on top, not the whole ice cream sundae. Don't throw out an amazing experience just because it could theoretically be better, and let her know that it is not her fault and you will be 100% ok with her saying \"enough is enough\". As much as people talk about it, fucking someone till you or they walk funny is only nice every once in awhile and as a \"we were so caught up we didn't notice\" not as a \"We were playing sex chicken and no one blinked and now we feel like we were in a car crash genital first.\"   \n\n\nTL;DR - Sex is more than orgasms, let them know stopping is ok beforehand, and just enjoy yourself after this long time away from companionship.",

I know a lot of people who experience ED talk about how constantly thinking about it during sex just makes it worse for them and can ruin the experience.\n\nSex isn\u2019t just about finishing - it\u2019s a great part of sex - but there\u2019s so much else that is awesome that you can focus on. \n\nTreat it like a blessing! You can become the most generous lover - and people looove that.\n\nTurning on a partner and pleasuring them, making them your focus can work miracles for your confidence and help in getting yourself off.\n\nA bi friend of mine likes to joke with me and our other male friends: \u201cYou guys gotta learn sex doesn\u2019t even need a penis\u201d. I think it\u2019s a clever point, and the perspective has changed some ways I think about intimacy.\n\nBest of luck! Worse case scenario you could try out a career in porn?",

You need to reduce your frequency ad much as possible (in a way that doesn't destroy your mind), so maybe just do it once a week. It will let yourself feel your desire grow. It will also stop you from using it as a way to control your mood.\n\nAlso, when you do have sexual experiences, do not make it a priority for you to orgasm. If you see it's not going to happen so just go for a bit, make sure your partner is having fun then stop.\n\nThe most important in all this is to not beat yourself up so much about it. You'll be fine. Just take your time with yourself and your body. Don't start getting stressed about it and thinking people will not be happy if you don't perform until the end. Just be kind and patient with yourself and you'll enjoy yourself very soon.",

It could also mean you dont match in the sexual aspect of the relationship. \nAnyways, i wish you the best and hope you can fix things.",

It really really makes a difference, coming from a girl who's uh, slept around and compared notes lol. There's a marked difference in reactions of guys who do/don't watch porn, and masturbation habits. \n\n2) Please set time limits. If you aren't going to come then don't push for it for ages. Focus on other ways to enjoy the sex minus the O and try again later. It's way more effective to keep getting hotter and hotter as you stop and go than to have a slow decline in stamina while both you and she become increasingly sore... My ex had major issues like you've described and I never was upset that he couldn't come- but it did upset me that he was upset that he couldn't, and that I basically became a human flashlight while he tried to come and couldn't... in 2.5 years it was never resolved. He also refused to cut masturbation and porn, which I still believe would have helped massively. And no, he wasn't on any meds.",

It\u2019s good to have a partner that is multi-orgasmic but even they will run out of gas eventually. Make the majority of your sessions about her and gradually stop when she\u2019s clearly running down-it\u2019s very noticeable. Keep it under 25% of the time that you drive past her abilities and when you do make sure you know what works and be willing to put in the effort to finish.\n\nThere are a lot of women who never get to experience the finish due to the men they\u2019re with, be happy you\u2019re not a guy on that side of the coin.",

When I do it the grip isnt that hard at all, its just easier to get off when I'm comfortable and alone. I couldnt get off on my first hookup after a long dry spell just because I was nervous and uncomfortable. The problem was helped by cutting back on masturbation, but it also just kinda got better over time as I became more comfortable with that partner and felt less pressured and anxious.\n\nBut yeah, if you're death gripping your dick during masturbation, definitely try a more relaxed grip. It isnt necessary to squeeze to get off.",

Obviously I masturbated a lot during that time. Then I had a few opportunities land in my lap and was able to have a bit of sex again. With first girl, it was like I always was before the dry spell. With the second, it definitely took more work (though nothing like OP says) and I was a bit confused. We did discuss it and switched to a more sensitive condom (Durex ultra sensitive ftw) and it helped a ton. In that relationship, we eventually got to the point of using no protection, and it was perfect then. Like, mind-blowingly perfect. Sigh, miss her.\n\nMy point is that sometimes people fit together differently, and also the condoms you use can absolutely be factor. I'm sure \"death grip\" can be a factor too, but evidently I don't do that (I'm uncircumcised... whenever I hear these \"death grip ruined me\" stories, I often wonder if that is a factor too).",

Porn sexually desensitizes our brains to human sexual contact because the main thrill of it is in the seeking of more and more curiosity-satisfying novelty which continuously increases in intensity the more you seek it. To the point where your mind requires more taboo or novel stimulation than your body does. Which basically leads to mental sexual boredom even while your body is primed and desiring sexual interaction. It takes both mind and body in synchrony to achieve orgasm. Maybe try taking a break from erotic material for at least 2-4 weeks. That\u2019s roughly how long the brain takes to rewrite itself to a new habit.",

Give yourself time, make sure that when you do masturbate you always use some sort of lubricant (hand lotion even) and try to really get into whatever you're thinking about/watching. There's totally a psychological aspect to it as well. I got to the point where I wasn't even enjoying orgasms, it had become more of a release for tension instead of actual pleasure. The problem will be over quicker than you think. You'll get used to a more gentle touch.\nAnother thing that might help: see if your partner would be interested in masturbating together with you. Again this will help psychologically because you'll start to associate that with someone you like. Most importantly, don't beat yourself up about it (heh) the psychological aspect is very real here.",

Unfortunately I think what really helped me was actually meeting a really understanding partner who helped me work through it. It sucks but a big piece of it is being able to have sex more regularly, cause you might need to retrain your body to the exposure, however the two big pieces of advice would be\n\nA: you don't have to finish with penetration, when you're first starting if you're going at it for that long switch things up and finishing by jacking off is a ok and you don't have to make a big deal out of it, like there's plenty of situations where that is just a pleasurable thing to do (i wouldn't recommend this every time but it helps to finish when you can't) \n\nB: get yourself a toy. Like a rubber/silicone pocket style thing. It helps with the death grip, retraining yourself to respond to a softer option where you can still masturbate but without squeezing, focus on gentler touch with yourself and you'll see results faster than you think. It gets better, good luck.",

We both laughed about it when she told me the aftermath.\n\nEdit:\n\nShould say, that yeah there's a big mental aspect to sex.

It has more to do with your mind, getting relaxed, and comfortable. You just need to let your partner know that it might take a while to get to that point. You also need to read her body and know when she is ok with being done. \n\nGood luck mate",

Better for it, even.  The rare sessions where I do get off easily wind up feeling somewhat unsatisfying, and most of the time when I go to bed with people who just fuck to cum it's disappointing, and feels weirdly goal-oriented.  But most of my partners are women, and women are way less likely to do that.\n\nFocus on the pleasure of the act, the fun, the intimacy.  Get your partner off, enjoy their body and the way they move, and the pleasure you feel for its own sake.  Sex is a WHOLE fucking experience.  Orgasm is the smallest part of it, and it can be so much fun even if you don't usually get off.  It should be centered on the people, not some goal.  Bonus: once you detach from your orgasm as the end-all, you get to fuck around and play for as long as you and your partners(s) want.  Double secret bonus: you'll probably find it easier to get off when you focus on pleasure rather than focusing on climax.\n\nYou may, occasionally, run into women who \"don't get it\".  It's only happened twice for me that someone tried to consolingly tell me \"it's okay\", when I told them I wasn't gonna cum.  In reply I just looked at them with as much friendly bewilderment as I could muster.  Frankly, nether of them was an especially fun lover.",

It was hit or miss with me cumming when we fucked from then on. One thing that helped was fucking her awhile, going down on each other, etc, them waiting awhile before trying again. A few hours. Often it'd feel even better the second time because of the buildup and I'd get mine. Having her give me handjobs always helped. So did experimenting with positions and things like that.\n\nContinued not touching myself besides with her and within a few weeks we were busting quickies out between classes. Find someone patient. Respond to their queues. Experiment with things. And relax. If something doesn't feel good to you don't force yourself to do it. Find what does feel good and lean into that. It's a gnarly problem to have because there is no easy solution. Having it makes it worse in a vicious cycle because then you're anxious. Don't make blowing your load the focus, make it pleasure.\n\nGood luck with future partners",

After we broke up I hooked up with another girl and while I did eventually get off it just didn't feel right. I got back with my highschool sweetheart and something about her love language really does it for me. She walks in the room and I'm ready to go. We are married now and have a kid. I still look at a lot of porn and masturbate and we still have lots of really good sex. Sometimes I think it's just the body doesn't want it even though you think it does. The penis really does have a mind of its own sometimes. Think about this too. You should be able to masturbate to climax with her if you felt comfortable but I bet you couldn't. You thought you wanted it but in the end you didn't. It happens to more guys than you think because men are very concerned with their self image. Women know this and understand because they too can dry up and have no idea why. I can make my wife have many orgasms easily yet she has had a hard time getting off in the past.",

You might be going at it way too hard or more likely, it's all in your head. \n\nWhen I had sex the very first time I was 23. I couldn't finish to save my life and it took over a month for me to finally finish the first time. Anytime I've hooked up with someone new, I've struggled to finish but after I get comfortable with them, it's a non issue. \n\nI think a lot of it is you are in your head too much and letting this fear of not finishing actually stop you from doing that. There should be no issue with jerking off and having sex unless you are absolutely beating the living fuck out of your dick to the point skin is becoming raw and inflamed and painful to touch. \n\nStopping masturbating does help with sensitivity but it shouldn't outright stop your from finishing during the act.",

My current girlfriend doesn't mind because we just have sex until she orgasms and then she'll usually give me a blowjob. I can ejaculate from a blowjob. I used to think I couldn't because my ex never made me cum from a blowjob. Turns out she just couldn't suck dick good. \n\nYou shouldn't stress so much. Cut back on masturbating and it might help but if you look it up is common. Just please your girlfriend and then figure out other ways to make you ejaculate. A good lover will be patient with you and teach you how to please her and work on pleasing you. You just haven't found the right girl. And if she can't make you cum from a blowjob, it's because she can't suck dick. Good luck.",

It's also fine to masturbate without orgasm. You really need to work on believing this first and foremost.\n\nI don't think abstinence will be as useful as getting used to sex with less-than-deathgrip stimulation. Try masturbating with just two or three fingers. But you need to approach this with curiosity about trying to find what feels good, and you need to be kind to yourself on the journey. If you don't orgasm, it's no big deal, try again later. If you get super frustrated over time bring it up with your doctor.\n\n\"Relax, don't do it, when you want to go to it\" <-- truth\n\nAlso, make sure you're getting plenty of cardiovascular exercise.

Of course it's the opposite, i couldn't find myself finishing at all for some reason. But i think i found a solution, which helped me personally and I'm not sure it would do the same for you. I find it difficult to orgasm when i thrust with hard force/speed, despite it feeling amazing for her and me, it just doesn't get me there. But i slowed down, tried getting more intimate, i tried going in and out, feeling every sensation slowly, and it worked. It felt amazing, it took time of course, but once I found my pace, I felt my orgasm building up and all i had to do was stick to that pace. Speed and force isn't always the way to go, everyone has a different way of getting there, so i would suggest trying new things AKA positions, pacing, kinks, fetishes etc.",

I could make my partner cum multiple times, stay hard as a rock, and keep going, but after awhile I started wondering if it was even possible for me to cum. and obviously I started to become preoccupied with that and worry if I was making her feel unattractive or unwanted, if something was wrong with me, etc. (Which probably made things even worse) But the longer we dated, the more I eased up and became comfortable with her, and with sex, with making myself vulnerable to another person, and with my body, and all of the other things I was so preoccupied with, eventually...it happened. It took a while though. About three months or so. I just had to keep trying, even though I thought it would never happen.

I loved matching her speed and getting her off cowgirl but it wasn't enough and thrusting away missionary did nothing either. It wasn't until one night she took me by the hand and bent over the desk....I barely lasted it felt that amazing. Next night we fucked she was on all fours, and at that particular moment it's not like I was close or anything so I thought I'd last,  but just a few thrusts and I was going off like a fucking fountain again. That's when I learned what worked for me specifically. Everyone has their preferences and is sensitive in different ways. If a certain position just isn't doing it for you switch it up until you find what gets you off.",

I also experienced some SA so I generally felt uncomfortable with people putting their hands on my dick.\n\nBasically, I couldn't really cum by another person's manipulation when I first started having sex. Normally that just meant that I'd hit it, and if I felt comfortable enough, after they were satisfied I'd ask them to sit on my face while I masturbated. About 9 months after I started all that I finally managed to cum while inside someone (protected sex) and it was great, and then a couple weeks later I managed to do it again with a different person. I think you're just in that one episode of the superhero show where the hero loses their powers and learns that the real powers were the friends they made along the way or something.

But I also masturbated a lot as a teen and during single periods. My advice play to your strengths and once you feel she\u2019s orgasmed enough if she\u2019s one of the ones that orgasm more than once then pull out and finish either on her back, stomach or face. In my experience if you get them off enough they don\u2019t care where you finish. Also I\u2019d try and find a high sex drive lady. They are rare and hard to come by but they exist. I found sex is more of an activity with them and it\u2019s more fun which gets you off more.",

Not only I couldn\u2019t cum, she was done after a few minutes and we were done, she was full always and I wasn\u2019t, I tried alone and was so easy to finish even without the death grip. We are still together and after two months of no masturbation I can finish myself to her after she\u2019s done, we play a lot and is not like taking turns just doing it naturally, most of the sensation is back and I hope to regain full function soon!

From what it seems, she was understanding, but not something to feel ashamed about, since you openly talked about with her. In some situations, there\u2019s an adjustment period (mentally, physically, and emotionally), which also means there\u2019s room for communication, testing boundaries, and understanding what both brings you pleasure in the bedroom.",

Also your head if way more stimulated than your shaft.\n\nDo you see the issue? Your body is unable to process the stimulation of real sex because it got used to getting of a different way.\n\nA possible solution is to reset your brain/body by stopping with porn and masturbation for 6+ months and replacing it with normal sex.\n\nThe hard part is the willpower needed to stop getting one out for the little dopamine hit it provides.",

I\u2019d do my best to make them finish and they would do their best to help me finish. After a while I just got used to the fact I could never come. I moved to a new city when I was 27. Met a girl. Early relationship passion happens. We have constant sex. I still never really come. A several months goes by. I start to come. Nothing really changed to make it happen.

I took my time and was really really thorough with the kissing, licking, nibbling and eating her out. Instead of just trying to make her come ASAP, I made sure to spend the time warming her up and making it feel really good for her, instead of racing to get her to come.\n\nIn doing so I gave myself the chance to get really worked up, so when we got to the actual intercourse I still lasted a good 20-30 minutes, but was actually able to come (really really hard too) and as a bonus we came simultaneously! \n\nSo maybe give that a try?

      "text": "Ha. Female version of this kind of..  I (24F) trained myself when I was 14 to not want anything to do with sex because I found myself consumed by porn for like a month or so and I hated that I couldn't get my mind off of it. So I trained myself to be repulsed by porn... Which turned me off to sex as well, although I'm fully aware the two aren't the same. \n\nFast forward 5 years post mental training and I had my first boyfriend. Had sex. Didn't really hate it, but found that I really could go without it. \n\nThought this was normal. \n\nCouldn't figure out why my boyfriend always wanted to have sex, it's not like it's all that great? I'm good if we do it like once every two weeks, why aren't you?\n\nStill, we had sex frequently. But it took TWO WHOLE YEARS to experience my first orgasm and ACTUALLY enjoy sex. And it wasn't because he was bad, nothing we did changed. I don't know why that day was special. But yeah. Frick me. Life has never been the same. \n\nOh, but Im still absolutely repulsed by cum and I won't let anything get near my face. I still can't seem to get my mind past that. Thanks 14 year old me.. \n\nAnyways, moral of the story, discipline is good, don't get addicted to porn. But also don't frickin train yourself to be repulsed by something that is basically the bread and butter of adult life.",

If you're Masturbating to porn you have to stop watching the porn. Keep having sex as much as you can, it will be akward, but eventually you'll be able to orgasm during sex, if you have an understanding partner it really helps. This is the process that I found that actually works. Good luck.",

Can be reversed the same way you created it. Have fun, kinks certainly make sex far more interesting for both parties. Also, if you are going to pump a girl and make her sore like that, try letting her do the work, which is likely part of your kink lol",

So it's about finding the right partner or resetting your brain, stop masturbating, and stop looking at porn. Might take months or years but you'll eventually get back to normal.",

You just met a sweet girl, but sadly, she's apparently not sexually compatible with you (yet)\n\nI would suggest you to go to a prostitute and explain her the issue with your inability to cum and make her work to make you cum until you can cum by intercourse. Then go back to her, and tell her problem has been solved. (just tell her it was a psychological issue which you got it sorted out with your shrink if you're uncomfortable about telling the truth)",

There's just no denying it, despite how hard the naysayers try because, well, they're addicts themselves. \n\nGo to r/NoFap or r/pornfree for info on this sorta stuff (though don't get sucked into the culty side of those place). Google \"your brain on porn.\" Watch TED Talks about porn addiction. A lot of stuff you see will resonate with you. \n\nAt least it does with me. I've been trying to get away from porn for like a couple years now. Just by my experience, it really is the hardest drug to break because it's so easy to relapse and too damn available everywhere.

It's irrational.\n\nI struggle to finish, always have, before excessive porn. It's just how it is for some guys. If your girl doesn't like it she's kinda dumb and obviously inexperienced. Most women I've been with love it and can't believe it can last all night if they want.\n\nIt's a gift bro. Find a girl who appreciates it. Mine does. After our first time she laughed and yest her mate \"Ever met soneone who never cuts and goes all night\"\n\nIt's a blessing. Get good at fuciing and combine it with that and you'll he fine, with a women who wants a proper fuck.\n\nIf she was sore its because you don't know what you're doing tbh or just fucked up once  just hammered her cervix. You can fuck all night without doing that once you understand it. You'll know when you do thoughm unmistakable flinch. But if she can't walk properly it's because you did you job.\n\nYou both just sound inexperienced and need to find what works in your relationship sexually I think. Honesty helps. Just literally ask. They don't mind. They're taken aback often snd like the intrest you're taking in them getting theirs.\n\nYa girl needs to experience rye most common man in the bedroom. \"5 minute, 2 pump wonders\"\n\n\"Death grip\" is a myth women spread to not feel insecure about not making someone cum. I had this long sex thing long before I used Internet porn frequently. Sometimes I just don't finish.\n\nFunny, when a women doesn't finish, it's your fault.\nWhen you don't finish, it's your fault.",
