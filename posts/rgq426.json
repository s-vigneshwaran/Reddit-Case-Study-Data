Platforms usually consist of a welcoming by a member, music, and a talk by an Ethical Culture Leader, invited guest, or layperson. These gatherings are intended to educate, stimulate personal growth, inspire reflection and action, and build a sense of community. They may also include a moment of silence, a reading of a story or quotation, a Q&A with the speaker, and time to greet each other. Themes range from ethical teachings (Ethical Culture history and philosophy) to ethical action issues (environmentalism, human rights, and social justice), to personal stories (journeys, passions, and talents). Platforms are free, open to the public, and tend to be followed by refreshments and an opportunity to socialize.",

Priests often teach Religion at elementary schools for example. Also some money to maintain museums and such. Also, anybody here can join Christian Kindergartens and schools, doesnt even matter if they are Christian or not.\n\n\nThen a small part goes into social stuff, helping the poor and the ill.\n\n\nAnd well, around 10 percent goes into administration i think.\n\n\n\nEdit: oh. Kinda didnt answer your question. The protestant church is usually very transparent. The catholic not so much.  However, because of Tebartz van Elst, catholic rich bishop, more and more catholic bishops and priests are way more transparent now",

The worst part is that normally the scam money they get is tied to attendance, stupidity, craziness and peer pressure. \n\nThe moment you pay it through something like taxes nobody will care. Everyone pays relatively the same amount that is based on how much they have to give and it seems fair. \n\nThe pastor/priest has no reason to make his followers stupider, crazier or turn his church into something as close as possible to a cult (in the religious righteous view that it is something different from religion). Then you simply wait a few decades and priests and pastors stay the same leeches on society they always were but they don't even have to do more than a token amount of work for it anymore. And everyone is happy while the churches destroy themselves. At some point they get too weak and the natural scandals like nun run child prostitution rings become public and you can actually get rid of them completely. \n\nAnd the best part is they do it themselves. Because their scum rises to the top their leaderships are people that are unwilling to sacrifice their money and instead of shrinking the useless overhead they will rather save money at the lowest level and close local churches to save money. Which will make it obviously worse and so the idiots on their thrones will still be mostly happy while they close the last church. Let's hope they don't wake up enough to change it before then.",

Being part of those communities, it's very hard to break away from that support of family friends and even coworkers. \n\nIt's also arguable that social media networks  and it's ability to transmit  general misinformation like conspiracy theories and various irrational beliefs are just as much a threat even with if you got rid of the major religions. \n\n\nI kind of agree with the theories that religion evolved to fit the need of systems of trust outside one's tribes(and even as a test of that trust within the tribe) to allow greater institutions beyond what humans had grown to socialize with (150 or so) in defining in and outgroups. \n\nI don't think it's reasonable to expect humans to ever be complete  rational actors, but we can hope to strike a healthy  balance on how we behave when we lack information :)",

I am recognizing that someone who behaves out of a fear of punishment is not a good person who should be trusted. I want a world where people do what is right on the merits. I recognize thta is idealistic but honestly, the amount of evil that has been done in the name of a religion that is suppose to punish the wicked is proof positive that it doesn't work. Plus, a not insignificant portion of the religious believe that as long as they confess and ask for forgiveness then they aren't going to hell anyway so they can do as they please.

I just take comfort in knowing that enough people are dropping religious traditionalism. IE They are not identifying with the religion they were raised with. \n\nAlthough, it is a tough fight. My wife is atheist like me and her Roman Catholic Mother can sometimes scratch little ideas into her about \"how to explain things to a toddler\", or, \"how to let them know the different perspectives, especially about why most people are celebrating Christmas.\" \n\nIt's a really easy argument to win. We celebrate it for the same reason we celebrate Halloween. For Fun. It's just ancient Pagan folk lore. For presents",

Adjusted for population that's essentially the same anyway (of course this is only scalable so far - it doesn't mean that it's enough to ask one dude in Liechtenstein to get an accurate picture from there). \n\nYes, location is important. But it's not like they do the survey in one single place or something or don't adjust it for demographics. At least that's what I hope, I didn't look into this study I particular.\n\nFor the most part however it's close to irrelevant whether you ask 4,000 or 80,000 people. The minuscule gain in accuracy is totally offset by the expenditure of polling. \n\nIt's not like they *couldn't* do this in principle or just don't *care* about producing a good result, it's just not worth it, since the results are already quite accurate. Even if were +/- 2 to 3 percentage points, it doesn't really matter that much anyway, does it? The trend is pretty strong either way.",

      "text": "Does \"no religion\" mean that they a) have no religious faith,  b) aren't affiliated with any church, or c) neither one?\n\nUnfortunately, the decline in religious identification doesn't mean that a 29% minority of Americans think rationally, hold science in high fregard, value facts over faith or base their beliefs on evidence. The MAGA and anti-vaccine phenomena have demonstrated that many Americans exalt faith over fact, rhetoric over facts and and personal charisma over truth.\n\nIn many respects, MAGA is a religious cult.\n\nPart of the decline in organized religion has everything to do with sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic and other churches and very little to do with religiosity. Many Americans - including ex-Catholics - have renounced organized religion, but still believe - without evidentiary support - that God created the universe in seven days, that the Bible was divinely inspired, that Jesus answers prayers and that we live on in heaven or hell after death.\n\nAnd oppose abortion on religious grounds.\n\nIn short, they've shitcanned the institution but they've kept the faith.\n\nOthers who \"identify with no religion\" still believe in some sort of vague spirituality or deism - the belief that all nature is interconnected by some undefined spiritual or divine force.\n\nAnd still others are superstitious, believing in good and bad luck, astrology, omens and portents, \"thoughts and prayers,\" and the power of positive thinking and divine providence.\n\nA fractional decline in organized religion is an encouraging trend, but we have a long way to go before we have a truly just, rational and secular society.",
