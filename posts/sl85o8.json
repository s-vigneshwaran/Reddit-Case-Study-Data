I haven't listened to him in a few years so I don't know how much he brings it up these days, but I remember it being a fixation for a bit. I subbed in clowns for chimps, because people were talking about fighting clowns. It's honestly an easy joke and I don't feel that proud for making it.",

That consensus can and will change at times as the research progresses and new information is obtained. But anytime a supposed \u201cscientist\u201d is going against the consensus they should absolutely be treated with a hefty amount of skepticism (which is not to be confused with either blind belief or blind disbelief) but the antivaxx crowd doesn\u2019t bother to vet the credibility of the sources that feed their confirmation bias (I mean they still love to reference the **one** study that linked vaccines and autism, which has since been **proved** was **[fraudulent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3136032/)** because the author completely faked his data (I believe because of a vested financial interest)).\n\nNot every claim his controversial guests have made is necessarily false, but they are promoting information that either is not yet supported by actual research (ivermectin is currently in clinical trials as a potential treatment, but the anti malaria drug, that was touted in much the same manner previously, failed to show benefits at that stage despite showing promise in a lab so any suggestion to start using it now is absolutely premature as it may turn out to be unsafe for those afflicted with covid, ineffective, or both during actual clinical trials) or that is patently untrue (at least one of the studies the virologist has used as sources was a preprint study that was **retracted by the authors** when a big mathematical error was uncovered during the peer review process (which is part of why peer reviews exist))",

Rogan was basing his opinion during that show off of a [deeply flawed American report that wasn\u2019t peer reviewed](https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n2251).\n\nSo that\u2019s the thing isn\u2019t it. Teo brogan was misinformed and was spreading misinformation, but was lucky enough to be saved by a legitimate study afterwards that he wasn\u2019t referring to with his claim.\n\nThat\u2019s the most important piece of context that we cannot leave out since it really shows the truth; shows what\u2019s right.\n\nIt\u2019s also very interesting that Joe zeroed in on such a thing since he doesn\u2019t think younger people need to worry about Covid enough to get vaccinated. You know, the whole 99% survivability type of rationale. What\u2019s the UK study show for increased cases of myocarditis?\n\n1, 2, 6, and 10 additional cases per *one million*\n\nI\u2019m not rocket surgeon, but I\u2019m seeing a small risk. \n\n19/1E6=0.000019   ==  0.0019%  ==  99.9981% of not getting it\n\nSeems like he shouldn\u2019t even care about it at all if that\u2019s really what his reasoning is for younger people not needing the vaccine. \n\nI can\u2019t find risk of death for younger people to compare the numbers though, which I\u2019m sure is very small like that number right up there.",

                          "text": "Everyone is so damn misinformed about the controversy surrounding him. I agree that It doesn't matter what Rogan thinks. Anyone who gets their opinions from Rogan (who took human Ivermectin btw not \"horse dewormer\" but also took monoclonoantibodies then tried to say it was the Ivermectin that worked lol) is a dumbass. I believe he should be able to say whatever dumb opinion he wants, he's not a Dr., doesn't claim to be. You're right about that. \n\nFYI: There was one abstract that said Ivermectin killed COVID in a *Petrie dish* and called for further research, but that says *nothing* about what happens in a human body and anyone who is educated would read that abstract and immediately understand that doesn't mean it works in a human body, but misinformed, dumb and conspiracy people (like Rogan) read it and don't understand those caveats. So then the follow up studies got done and it doesn't work. But he won't retract. \n\nThe problem is (and why I'm on the side of NY and Joni Mitchell and others) he has Dr. grifters on his show that do mislead and misinform the public and people listen to them because of their credentials. One Dr. he had on had already been quietly debunked by colleagues and no one really knew of him....until Rogan shot him into the mainstream and exposed this grifter to millions. There are Dr.s that aren't ethical. Depak Chopra. Dr. Oz. The Dr. that linked autism to vaccines. \n\nBut most people know to take their views with a grain of salt. Rogan will find more grifters with credentials and platform them and the public doesn't know better yet. And by the time they do, the anti-vaxxers had already latched on to the Dr., which gave them a false sense of legitimacy they didn't have before. They continued to platform the Dr. I'm referring to, further setting back progress to end the pandemic and killing people. Normally I wouldn't say it's so serious, I'm not a fan of \"cancel culture\" and I did enjoy his show. But this is a global emergency and he is so damn irresponsible to use his influence to harm people. That episode needs a warning or to be removed. \n\nIt is certain statistically that some of the millions that downloaded the episode in question were on the fence about the vaccines, heard this Dr. say they don't work and to stand against mandates, didn't get it as a direct result of that Dr. and then some of those people died. \n\nSome people he has on are already popular and we all know they're wacky, so it's whatever. But having *that* Dr. on in a middle of a pandemic was so GD irresponsible and seriously harmed people and our entire country as whole. \n\nHe harms people not just by his opinions but by finding grifters with credentials to back up his misinformed opinions, then he won't retract when the evidence shows they were wrong. That's the *real* problem with Rogan. Not things *he* says that turn out to be wrong. While researching the Dr. he platformed he would have seen he had been disgraced and Dr.s all over the world had called their colleague out. But he didn't tell his listeners that. He wanted someone with credentials to back up HIS bullshit and ofc he found it. If you're a rich celebrity, you can find someone with credentials to say what you already think, even if it's wrong and not the opinion of the medical establishment as a whole. But he presents the info as if it is, or just an equally acceptable \"alternate view.\" Bullshit, some views are just wrong because the evidence says that, even if it's coming from a Dr. He needs to be held accountable for that. Say something stupid, fine. Say something stupid and mislead the public into thinking the medical profession backs you up? Not okay. At all",

So many things I don't even know where to start - but most recently I read about how he thinks people who are transitioning shouldn't be prescribed steroids because \"there's no medical reason for it\", but he's okay with using them himself when his only reason for it is to stay buff. So, that makes him an idiot *and* a hypocrite.\n\nHe claims his use of the n-word over the years \"is not real racism, it's a joke\" - which is just plain dumb, and again, ridiculously ignorant.\n\nIn 2020, he claimed that the forest fires in Oregon were being started by left wing \"activists\", but those claims were simply untrue. Local law enforcement and even FBI agents investigated the claims and came out with nothing. The way he throws around gossip like it's factual is, in fact, stupidity at its finest. He admitted he didn't look into it before repeating what he had read in a single story.\n\nHe thinks \"cancel culture/woke culture\" is about silencing white men... I'm not even going to go into why *that's* stupid.\n\nThe man is an idiot and confidently incorrect too many times to actually keep track of. He backpedals on *so many things* just for the sake of PR. I doubt he means any of it when he apologizes. I honestly don't understand how he still has a fan base with all of this garbage.",

Given all that there is an argument to be made that it was faked. \n\nDo I believe it was? Like I already said no, but to claim with absolute surety that the only way to believe in them being faked is to be stupid is not only really self righteous, but also incredibly naive and short sighted. \n\nWhat you've said is we can disagree about personal preferences but not on historical events? \n\nThere's actually a saying that perfectly encapsulates this, perhaps such a LEARNED person such as yourself may have heard of it before, but just in case I'll say it again for you. \"History is written by the victors\"",

But when it came down to it, certain individuals were purposefully kept off the show due to the fact based and logical evidence that would have been provided and presented. \n\nI wonder why that happened... Upon further research into the topic all from Joe Rogans public perspective on the matter, as well as the individuals kept at bay regarding the topic, I found it very interesting... Extremely interesting in fact. Joe Rogan always presents himself and his show as someone who prides himself on seeming \"intelligent.\" One would assume that for sure the shape of the earth would be something that show and himself would like to dwelve deeper on, but the producers seemed to not allow it.\n\nThere are only two reason why something of such a matter would be purposefully avoided....the topic is either bullshit, or, there are actual intelligent individuals looking to come on the show that are looking to present nothing but logical, fact based evidence. Apparently, Joe wanted to show to happen, a debate with Neil degrass Tyson, but producers and Mr Tyson opted against it.\n\nThose are top player in their fields and are willfully choosing to avoid true critical and objective analysis.... Kinda interesting and alarming, and should have one's BS meter going off and raising red flags... Not about the topic, but about the host and their act on being total and genuine source of knowledgeable information.\n\nI mean absolutely no hate or anything of the such. I am genuinely curious and would like to know your thoughts from a Unbias, logical, critical, rational, objective and open minded perspective.\n\nMuch Love and Peace. \ud83c\udf33",

Obviously everybody in the room knew what was going on. They just had to modify their questions a bit, instead of asking Sacha, they had to ask \"Borat\".\n\nThere's even been some TV interviews after the movie released, where obviously even the morning TV hosts knew Borat was a character.\n\nIf he did it on Rogan, I don't think it would be that bad. My only take is that Joe likes to do 2, 3 hour interviews. If he did it with Sacha in-character they'd probably have to cut it down to 1 hr, or less. But would still have the potential to be funny.",

Its acceptance was somewhat unique among the states due to its specific laws.\n\nOregon's real issue with race is not that it's \"The most racist\" or anything, it's just that it's just about as racist as everyone else while pretending to be extremely liberal and open-minded.",

That is a general statement about the morals of an entire group that you can label with the term celebrity. So either you think all celebrities have no moral structure or it was just that, a generalization. So if it was a generalization then I wanted to know which celebrities you believe have moral structure. You knew this and are trying to change what you said now. So I will ask a simpler question for you. What do you see as moral structure and where did you get yours?",

Then there started to be more and more right wing stuff, then Joe moved to Texas, and it's been a lot of right wing grifters, it's been a lot of bad people. And then Joe tells his subscribers if they're young and in good shape don't get vaxxed, that it's a risk..but it isn't, getting covid without a vax IS a risk. Ontop of that, Joe's subreddit has always made fun of Joe, but when the_donald got banned, a lot of those people flocked to JRE and the subreddit has progressively gone right wing, same with conspiracy.",

I've said and done bad shit too man, but I recognize that you need to apologize if you fuck up. And he did that and I'm really happy he did.

My point being is they know him better than anyone else, so why not just give him the benefit of the doubt?\n\nAnd there you go \ud83e\udd23 look how easy it is for you to think someone is racist. THIS is why he shouldn\u2019t have to apologise. Because the people demanding it are just morons who jump to conclusions way to quickly and don\u2019t know shit. You aren\u2019t worth apologising for. You just have nothing better to do.\n\nAlso I can guarantee you are not consistent with your beliefs at all. Because if you were you would always be pissed off at everyone forever. Which is also why it\u2019s dumb. We\u2019re all human, we all make mistakes, we all have misjudgements etc. so just get over it and move on with your life.\n\nHe hardly preaches any racist shit. He\u2019s by far one of the most open minded and accepting and caring people who are famous. So stop hyper focussing on nonsense and see the bigger picture",

So this is still an unprecedented medical achievement, that if more widely adopted would probably have kept the US from performing the worst among developed nations in the Omicron wave for hospitalization and deaths.",

All of this uncertainty is and was out there as we went along.

I guess that's what people expect.  If we'd managed to vaccinate 80% of the planet and there was no immunocomprimised patient in Africa to kick around Covid then yeah, maybe no Omicron.  \n\nI think you'll find a lot more humility in longer articles over the pandemic.  There's a fog of war here and you can't see the best corse of action 100% in the present.  But you can recommend what will likely be a better course of action--which is getting vaccinated.",

Since he has been through the early days of AIDS, Ebola outbreaks, etc.  Biden bases things on what facts are but is still a politician.\n\nAgain, though, there are also things I read in real time from various sources that laid out the scenario we're in.  Multiple waves with Covid fatigue (which was a fear), masks being useful so we shouldn't message that you don't need, etc.\n\nI think Dr. Birx, unfortunately for her, came out looking much worse because she bent her messaging to Trump\u2019s in the prior administration.

Rogan is mostly misguided so he's not a paid propagandist like O'Reily, but he's completely committed to a position. He keeps hosting people who reinforce his position (tens if not hundreds of episodes on the anti-vax point of view at this point), with near-zero representation of the point that opposes his. This is especially frustrating when the pro-vaccination point of view is the scientific consensus (near unanimity) and has all the evidence in the world to back it up. However, Rogan is entrenched. It's part of his identity. He's going to do nothing but try to reinforce his own point while trying to prove to himself that he's neutral by hosting the rare proper scientist.",

Scientists do their debates in conferences and in the written literature. Their conclusions is overwhelmingly pro vaccines.\n\n>You may want to have totally one sided media\n\nIn the scientific community, there aren't two sides to the vaccine debate. In this case, the truth is one-sided. There literally are near-zero studies about all the crazy shit Joe and his guests talk about. Give me scientists with actual, ongoing studies and scientific output. Mainstream media is shit all the time, and they're shit at covering the vaccine. Just because they happened to say the truth once in a blue moon doesn't detract from it being true.\n\n>The only credibility he gained was he was brave enough to have an opposing voice on his show, which few people on either side of the media landscape do\n\nExactly. He gained this credibility. That was the point.\n\n>Honestly, being genuine, did you watch the gupta JRE episode?\n\nNot all of it, because Joe was coming across as super hard-headed as he usually is with this topic. He then hosted anti-vax people again after that episode. Did he actually host anyone who opposes his point of view after Gupta?",

So i don't understand why you want bill oreilly to have less crediblity as a newscaster. Shouldn't the desire to have more for all our newscasters?(i hate bill oreilly btw)\n\n\"Did he actually host anyone who opposes his point of view after Gupta?\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhonestly  this is probably the part that is most bothersome about the recent jre pushback.  You haven't watched the Gupta episode in it's entirety and you even have the nerve to ASK if he has had any opposing views on since that episode. If you are critical of joe rogan and claim him to be  \"someone committed to one point of view without even wanting to change or seek the truth\" you should know the answer to that question, and for you to be right the answer would be no, after Gupta he never had someone who challenged him on the topic on.\n\nBut you are not right, since the Gupta episode, you clearly missed the entire Josh szeps episdoe where szeps makes Rogan look like a fool, which he often is. I prefer comedy episodes for this reason, but I don't dole out criticism to episodes i haven't sought out or listened to...\n\n\"Listen before you talk\" is almost always sound advice.

I was seeing a guy I liked (Rogan) act like a lunatic. Of course I'd stop watching. I was a fan of his podcast and saw him deteriorate over time. Having a comedian on isn't good enough for an \"opposing viewpoint\" when he's platforming tons and tons of people who, otherwise, have zero credibility to go against the science. Again, there is no scientific evidence against the vaccine and tons of evidence for it, and hosting a comedian is what's supposed to be the proper counterbalance to all the misinformation? Seriously?\n\nI watched tons of JRE. I used to be a fan of his inquisitive nature. Now, he's just a conspiracy theorist who has gone mad.",

He is succumbing to his biases because he's human and he's not used to properly looking past them. He is causing a huge amount of harm by spreading this, and I do think he has blood on his hand. However, he's not paid to do it. The comparison to Bill O'Reilly was just to show a more extreme version of bias.\n\nThis whole thing will calm down once the GOP has milked it enough to win a couple of elections. Same as Benghazi.

A person definitely has the responsibility to not believe Rogan's idiocy. However, the person spreading the misinformation and strongly defending and giving credibility to those spreading it also shares the responsibility. I can't be going around telling people to get neurosurgery from a quack, pushing it, defending him, and attacking anyone who disagrees, then turn around and say \"it's not my fault that you believed me.\" That's not reasonable.

He comes off as hostile and disrespectful towards doctors and favors the guests who are absolute looney toons. When someone with a PhD and 30 years of study tries to school Rogan, Joe isn't open to listening or learning, but instead makes bull headed assumptions to reinforce his incorrect stance, and attempts to diminish his more knowledgeable opponents reputation and expertise, which inevitably leads to Rogan having to issue an apology 3 days later after all the backlash subsides.  \n  \n  The formula for the show is archaic and nobody needs this.

We like dressing nice, it boost our self esteem, it's part of being woman and being human. All women can back up my claim. Even women who wear hijab and are religious also wear lipstick, no shit these women aren't asking for men's sexual attention, they just love wearing lipstick. Jordan Peterson was just being insensitive, and using 'evolution bs' to back it up. He didn't even try to see it from women's perspective. I get offended? More like he got offended by career women with make up lol",

But also, since I\u2019m not the one in charge of these decisions, I\u2019m not hoping for it to go one way or the other regarding banning trans athletes from competition, but I find it to be a ridiculous and unscientific notion that someone who goes through 30 years of life as a male before transitioning isn\u2019t going to have an athletic advantage over a woman who didn\u2019t. \n\nAnd please, I could be wrong and I\u2019m open to the idea that my opinion on this subject could change, so if you have any scientific sources that could prove my viewpoint wrong, I\u2019m happy to read it.",

I've had people honk and throw things at me from vehicles.  I've had strangers give me fake compliments in a fake sweet voice, clearly mocking. I've had an entire group of grown adults at a theme park openly making fun of the fact that I'm a trans woman. I've had people question my driver's license even though all the info is correct. I've been threatened verbally and physically multiple times.\n\nI actually fear for my life every time I leave my home. It didn't used to be like this when I was younger and first transitioning, it's a matter of the rhetoric having gotten so much worse in recent times.

Another dishonest argument.\n\nEquating covid disinformation as a simple disagreement is the same dishonest argument it was the first time.\n\nNobody was suggesting you should agree with anybody on every single topic. Another dishonest argument.\n\nNobody is trying to shut down discussions because they \"don't like what they are talking about\". Another dishonest argument. Don't tout your fidelity to discourse when you *maliciously* misrepresent the arguments of other people.\n\nCompartmentalizing Rogan's disdain for vaccinations to himself is another dishonest argument. Covid19 is an infectious, deadly disease, and Rogan is an extremely influential celebrity with a massive following. His words matter.\n\nTo uncritically accept and promote Robert Malone is hypocritical. And also dishonest to call him the guy \"that invented the fucking MRNA vaccine\". \n\nTo dismiss criticism of Robert Malone because he \"isn't towing a party line\" is extremely dishonest. You're obviously aware that there are criticisms of him; therefore you are *intentionally* misrepresenting them.\n\nNobody is challenging the existence of discussions/conversations. Another dishonest argument.\n\nSubstituting arguments for covid19 as agreements about \"everything\" is still dishonest.\n\nThat's not what totalitarian means, but I'll irrationally give you the benefit of the doubt and say you just don't know what it means at all, rather than saying you're intentionally using hysterics like a toddler.\n\nDismissing the entire scientific community because they aren't literally infallible is still extremely dishonest.\n\nSaying that only Moderna/Pfizer employees have reason to be upset about Rogan's disinformation is hypocritical. And dishonest. Again; **the lack of infallibility does not mean that it is impossible to maintain standards of truth and reality.** \n\n> don't believe in conspiracy theories about the vaccines.\n\nOne last dishonest argument to top it all off. You've spent this entire argument equivocating covid19 disinformation with covid19 reality; by your *own* logic, there is no meaningful difference between covid19 conspiracy theorists and people who live in reality. Who are you to say that covid19 \"conspiracy theorists\" are such, if I am not one to say that Joe Rogan's \"opinions\" about covid19 aren't inconsequential?\n\nDoes \"I don't believe in conspiracy theories\" *really* mesh with this comment?\n\n> How much covid disinformation has been proven at least partially true since the beginning of 2020? Scientists, doctors, political figures, comedians, and athletes etc having conversations on a podcast is inconsequential.\n\nNo. It doesn't. Stop trying to play both sides, asshole. We can *still* see right through you.",

Even just one comment ago you were still maintaining that you don't believe in any covid19 \"conspiracy theories\". I actually had written a bit about how \"Nobody calls their *own* sincerely-held beliefs conspiracy theories\"-- but I deleted it for the sake of streamlining my thoughts.\n\nIt's an extremely bitter feeling, though. To make such an awful estimation of a person and then have that person painstakingly prove that you were right. Even though I know better, I still *want* to believe that *somehow* people like you have other's best intentions at heart. I *want* to say there's *some* reason you people act this way and it's not really your fault-- but I know it's wrong to deny you your agency.

But people saying that they thought it was leaked from a lab was deemed a conspiracy theory until it wasn't.

Lots of people should get the vaccines. Especially those likely to have a really rough go if they contract covid. But since the vaccines don't prevent the spread of covid forcing vaccinations on everyone seems silly. Even talking about therapeutics and anti viral treatments gets people labeled as conspiracy theorists or anti vaxers these days. People call out to boycott shows that talk about them. Musicians pull their music from platforms to try and get a parent company to silence those that don't tow the party line. It is disgusting IMO. The whole situation is filled with so much nuance that discouraging discussions about it seems ridiculous to me.",

Nothing in my message actually gives you clue one about how much I know about Joe Rogan. You're just *assuming* things about Joe Rogan, his knowledge, and his behavior. What's the source of that? Oh, right, Joe Rogan and press that writes fawning bios of him. Who's fantasizing now? I mean, hell, you clearly believe all the BS that he sells about himself.\n\nNice defensiveness on behalf of a complete assclown though. You're stretching your cognitive biases pretty hard already to ignore that he's selling you a bill of goods, but by all means, keep doing it.

Do you even know why you hate him now other than the news said he was a bad man? Have you ever listened to one of his podcasts when he brings on interesting guests? Are you capable of listening to someone speak with an open mind? Have you asked yourself any of these questions? Because you guys scare me. you don\u2019t think, you feel. you don\u2019t listen, you judge. Why does he need to be silenced now? Did you even listen to the podcast? From what I understand he brought the man who invented the technology used in the vaccines to talk about it, the man whom is one of the foremost experts in this field and the man was not happy with how this situation was being handled. So tell me is he being silenced because he\u2019s some crackpot who doesn\u2019t know what he is talking about? Or is he being silenced because this information is dangerous to political interests? You guys really need to start asking questions, you cannot just blindly trust anyone, not your government not the media, nobody. You need to hear both sides of an argument and go from there, if an idea cannot withstand scrutiny from an opposing viewpoint, it\u2019s a bad idea, what you are advocating here is to remove that scrutiny and have one narrative unchallenged. That is foolishness. Who cares who Joe is as a person, if Einstein was a piece of shit would that mean we ignore his contributions to science? Same goes for Joe, even if he were a piece of shit like you people claim you cannot discredit the information his show puts out there, if you disagree with what is being said that\u2019s up to you as a free thinking adult the same choice everyone else has to make. If your not happy with what is being said argue the point don\u2019t just remove it from the internet and hope it goes away that\u2019s stupidity as it doesn\u2019t address the argument, you will change nobody mind by banning it if anything you will make it more popular.",

Feels like we should probably recognize all the things he said that were true that people got banned on social media for. I mean, i got banned from like 12 subreddits just for telling the truth: the vaccine doesn\u2019t stop transmission.

It\u2019s been tested over and over and over and over and been shown to not be effective at protecting humans against Covid. There\u2019s no conspiracy among all the governments and doctors of the world to hide any Covid cures. If anything, including ivermectin, actually worked, they\u2019d be promoting it.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned any anti vax morons that want to take ivermectin instead of getting vaccinated should DEFINITELY do that. The more of them that die the better for humanity\u2019s gene pool. \n\nFrom https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/02/01/reuters-ivermectin-treatment-omicron-correction/\n\n>No, a Japanese company did not find that ivermectin was \u201ceffective\u201d against the omicron variant in a clinical trial, as Reuters originally reported on Monday. The wire service was forced to correct the article.\n\n>The actual news, as the current version of the article reads, is that ivermectin carries an \u201c\u2018antiviral effect\u2019 against Omicron and other coronavirus variants in joint nonclinical research.\u201d\n\n>The difference between the two versions couldn\u2019t be more dramatic: The mistaken version claimed that ivermectin was effective against omicron in humans; the corrected version claimed that ivermectin showed \u201cantiviral\u201d capabilities against omicron in test tubes. Reuters attributed the news to Kowa Co. Ltd., a Japanese pharmaceutical company.\n\n>The antiviral capabilities of ivermectin against SARS-CoV-2 in a test-tube environment are not a matter of breaking news: Research dating to 2020 showed that \u201ca single dose of ivermectin was able to reduce the replication of an Australian isolate of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero/hSLAM cells by 5000-fold.\u201d There were many reasons, however, for skepticism about how that finding would carry over into real-life treatment.\n\n>But ivermectin has remained in the spotlight thanks to boosters such as Joe Rogan, Spotify\u2019s star podcaster who is currently dealing with a backlash over his covid commentary. Rogan told his audience in September that ivermectin was among the drugs he\u2019d taken after testing positive for the coronavirus. Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that comes in both animal and human formulations, and the Food and Drug Administration has counseled against its use against covid, though some doctors have prescribed the human version for this purpose.",

It was awarded a Nobel because it's an amazing antiparasitic drug, and has likely saved countless lives because of it. There's been exactly 1 study done, and not peer reviewed mind you, that shows ivermectin has any effect on COVID, and the results showed that there was a correlation between ivermectin use, and reduced fatality rate of covid infections. They don't know why yet, and every single one of those patients was already in the hospital and receiving full support by medical staff. These aren't some smoothebrains self medicating horse paste at home because some thumb told them to do it. Ivermectin can be extremely toxic to humans if taken improperly, which I guarantee anyone that's buying ivermectin from some shady doctor is doing. If ivermectin is found to be effective in reducing COVID fatality rates for people already infected, fucking a, let's give it to every patient who needs it. You know what does a much better job than ivermectin though? The fucking vaccine.\n\nAlso, did you even read the article you linked, or just look at the URL and think \"yep, that fully supports what I'm saying\"? In the actual title of the article, it says that the Nobel was awarded for it's treatment of parasitic infections, which COVID absolutely is not.",

There is a certain kind of person who is prone to disbelief of mainstream narratives, and he is definitely one of them.  \n\nEarly on when I started listening to him around 2013ish I got pretty good at not listening to the podcasts where his guests were nuts. Most of the comedians were pretty entertaining (some were terrible) and I really enjoyed listening to experts he had on. Some of the experts were obvious loons, but they were a minority. \n\nHe gets a lot of hate for things he didn't do or say, or about jokes he made. I remember about a dozen times when controversies popped up surrounding one of his episodes. Most of the time the news reports got the story wrong and/or took a quote out of context. Not every time, but most of the time.\n\nHe did say the n-word several times, and I remember thinking at the time that it may come back to haunt him. He didn't say it in a mean, hateful or derogatory way, but still.\n\nYes, I expect to be downvoted for this post.",

Any of his own opinions have been formed from the information he\u2019s seen, same as any of us, and he does talk about them on his show, but it\u2019s supposed to be entertainment and he reaffirms constantly that he\u2019s not a doctor and is an idiot. That\u2019s not exactly \u201cspreading\u201d misinformation so much as just having a discussion. \n\nHowever, because he has such a large platform, and we live in the Information Age, asking questions counter to the mainstream narrative or having anyone on with an outlandish idea does allow those concepts to propagate and even flourish in some areas, especially among idiots who can\u2019t think for themselves. \n\nReally this is a problem of current times that we haven\u2019t exactly seen before. Both sides definitely have merit. On the one hand, no, he isn\u2019t intentionally spreading misinformation. On the other, his platform and medium means that misinformation is definitely being spread. \n\nSo the question is, do we censor his content and anything like it because it poses such a danger to society, and thus sacrifice our ability to discuss new ideas (even the good ones)? Or do we cling to first amendment principles and allow open discussion in our forums, but accept the risk that stupid people may misunderstand and potentially kill themselves? \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a right answer and we\u2019re going to have to find a middle ground.",

It's been used to treat river blindness since the 80's and still is, that's definitely modern as far as medicine is concerned.\n\nWrong about it winning a Nobel prize? In 2015 it won the first Nobel prize for the treatment of infectious diseases to be issued in 6 decades. (if that's not modern medicine idk what is btw)\n\nWhat exactly did he say that was incorrect? How is he disregarding science by pointing these things out?",

Their wrong decisions and fighting for their \"freedom\" is literally killing other people. Antivaxxers share the blame for all of these deaths and are murderers, pure and simple. Who needs de-radicalized again? Oh right, the plague-spreaders that are proudly keeping the pandemic going over some bullshit idea of freedom that they have concocted in their heads.

There was reason to believe it might be useful in humans as an antirviral as well, in lab studies it did kill covid, but at a very high dosage. It also has proven to have Anti viral properties with other viruses. \n\nI\u2019m regards to the lab study, there are a lot of cases where those lab studies can work at lower doses, or they can work in the lab study and not work in practice. But there is reason to test whether ivermectin was useful or not.\n\nAlso ivermectin works similarly in one way to Pfizer\u2019s new antiviral drug that had huge efficacy in stopping covid replication \n\nhttps://youtu.be/ufy2AweXRkc",

With massive anti-vax sentiment spreading, people crusading against literally ALL public health measures related to COVID, and nearly 1 million Americans dead, you're statement is just literally wrong. Like it or not, people clearly DO need misinformation stopped before it gets to them. This isn't a matter of live and let live, because the dumb fucks buy into all this anti-vax shit are literally responsible for spreading this preventable disease that has killed 900000 Americans and counting. So whether we like it or not, there's a large portion of our population that can't be trusted to not be fucking idiots, and drag the rest of society down with them.",

I\u2019m just against people doing it so irrationally and quickly without much thought.\n\nI\u2019m so sure of it because the media is so very known for being extremely biased and pushing a certain agenda to whatever fits their narrative the most.

This is also something that\u2019s not being reported\u201d\n\nAny lockdown regarding Covid-19 \u201cmakes things worse\u201d\n\nAlex Jones was \u201cright\u201d that \u201cactual microchips being injected into your arm to see if you have Covid-19\u201d\n\n\u201cit\u2019s more of a treatment than it is a vaccine, really, if you look at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cthey are letting in thousands and thousands of people who are positive with COVID.\u201d\n\n\u201cmRNA vaccines are really gene therapy\u201d\n\nivermectin \u201cessentially cured COVID\u201d in Uttar Pradesh, India. \n\nDr. Anthony Fauci and the National Institute of Health funded \u201cexperiments on these beagle puppies and they put their heads in cages and filled the cages with sand flies where the sand flies were literally eating the beagles alive.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t statements of opinion.  These aren\u2019t just asking questions.  Open mindedness has nothing to do with it.  These are direct statements presented as fact and are all verifiably untrue.\n\nMore importantly he gives a platform to people spouting scientifically inaccurate statements.  He is legitimately an expert on MMA, comedy and even entertainment generally and he has guests who are experts in those fields regularly.\n\nBut when he goes on to platform others he is positioning himself in the same manner he discusses MMA and comedy, as an expert, and subsequently that the people he has on promoting pseudo science are therefore also positioned as experts when they are purely contrarians.",

He also was one of the few to give Bernie a huge platform and agreed with him on alot of issues as well as Tulsi gabbard and Andrew yang... funny how the attacks on him started then. Also i dont think he trys to mislead anyone just belives some stupid things lol unlike every news outlet the lies on purpose because you know ratings who cares about the truth. Also all these big ppl calling for his cancelation why dont they just go on the show and correct him where they think hes wrong insteed of just trying to silence him.",

He has little remaining empathy and he's become a full on narcissist bathing in his limelight. \n\nThat's when I stopped enjoying it. Maybe he was always a douche canoe, and I'm not pretending to know the guy, but I can't fathom how some of his rabid fanbase can be so defensive to any kind of criticism.

Rogan isn\u2019t a journalist!  He\u2019s a pothead comedian with an entertaining podcast, nothing more.  Having said that, Rogan is likable because he is relatable and is someone you\u2019d have a beer with.  Other media like Tucker Carlson, Brian Steltzer, Chris Cuomo, and Don Lemon are all people I want to see punched in the face because they are nothing but bullshitters.  Rogan isn\u2019t someone we should be taking advice from, but he has a good podcast.  It\u2019s insane how much people want to highlight his errors.  He doesn\u2019t take himself half as seriously as these people are taking him.",

Thank you for your reply.\n\nMy question was specifically about your use of the term/phrase \"the left\". Somehow, you did not use the term/phrase \"the left\" anywhere in your reply. Nevertheless, I am compelled to address you directly.\n\n>Didn't think I'd have to be so specific given the context here.\n\nI *believe* when communicating through an internet text forum with strangers \"context\" *need be established*. This is always the case when outside the \"echo chamber\". \n\n>I thought it was obvious but I guess not.\n\nThings can be obvious *to you*. Things are not obvious *for other people.*\n\n>Liberal people and the major party that is closest to them (Democrats) are openly in bed with big pharma and pro censorship over the last 5ish years.\n\nI believe \"Liberal people and the major party that is closest to them (Democrats) are openly in bed with big pharma\" is true (analytically). This is because liberalism and capitalism go hand in hand.\n\nI believe that \"cancel culture\" is part of an *outrage machine* built by the capitalist. I do not believe de-platforming is censorship. I recognize a relationship between capital, political parties, big-media and \"big-pharma\", but recognizing this relationship and the feedback loops between them does not mean Joe Rogan is having his *rights* infringed. His is a business contract. Though it may include a non-compete clause preventing him from quitting and a \"morality\" clause which may compel Rogan to behave a certain way or be fired. Again, this is not censorship.\n\nFurthermore, I believe \"Liberal people and the major party that is closest to them (Democrats) are openly... pro censorship over the last 5ish years\" is false. The PMRC was co-founded by Tipper Gore. The assignment of \"Parental Advisory\" stickers on music is the same as a content warning on Joe Rogan's Podcast. Moreover, any political ideology may place restrictions on what kind of information should be available, (unless the political ideology is based upon free access to information. i.e. not the DNC or GOP, ever)\n\n>Conservative people and the major party closest to them (Republicans) have crawled out of bed with big pharma (at least for COVID well see afterwards) and are anti censorship.\n\nI recognize the GOP and \"conservative\" disbelief about Covid-19 and vaccines, but I do not believe this represents a *crawling out of bed* with \"big pharma\". Before I say more, I must ask, what do you consider \"big pharma\"?\n\nThe second part of your statement \"Conservative people and the major party closest to them (Republicans)... and are anti censorship\" is false. It is Republican governor's on behalf of Republican State legislatures and conservative school boards which are censoring books and **methods of critical inquiry** from public schools and their libraries. This is actual censorship, unlike \"de-platforming\" or \"cancelling\" which are not a forms of censorship.\n\n>As a kid of the 80s and 90s, these roles were completely reversed.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, this statement is false. You do not know your own history!\n\n>It's just fascinating and sort of sad to see the ideals I grew up with (liberalism) cozying up with big pharma and being so blatantly pro censorship.\n\nLiberalism came about after the English Civil War and around the same time as capitalism. Then, in the 1980's under the Reagan administration, neo-liberalism became the de facto political/economic ideology of the US. So, if we're being clear about the history, the US has only ever existed within the philosophical tradition of liberalism. Now, it may be possible to understand the Trump administration as breaking away from neo-liberalism by way of fascism. But, and I can't stress this enough, what you're *seeing happen* to Joe Rogan is the will of the very liberalism you have always lived under. This **is** the free market at work.",
