Persian emperor Xerxes had invaded Greece to repay an insult the Athenians dealt to his father Darius (they gave military assistance to a Persian occupied city and burned the seat of the local Satrap) which Darius seethed over for the rest of his life but never managed to get around to repaying.  \n\nXerxes gave the Spartans several opportunities not to get between his father's unfinished business and Athens, first sending an envoy to warn them that the Persian army was so great, its arrows would blot out the sun, to which Leonidas famously responded \"then we will fight in the shade.\"   \n(he did not pointlessly bellow THIS IS SPAR TAAAH and murder the messengers, because that's what an insane idiot villain would do.  he let the messengers take his response back to Xerxes.  the way sane people with impulse control do.  okay so look i really did not like that movie but i'll try not to keep harping on it.)\n\nthe greek defense force chose to make their stand at Thermopylae - literally 'hot gates', it was a tourist attraction, a natural hot springs up in the mountains that also happened to be a  a natural bottleneck - in order to delay the Persian army and the rest of Greece time to gather and organize.    \n(also they were in the middle of a religious festival during which they were forbidden to pick up arms, it was a whole thing.)     \n\nbtw contrary to that fucking movie there were actually close to 3,000 Greek soldiers at Thermopylae, plus their shieldbearers, plus their slaves, plus their supply train.   the legend of the 300 Spartans comes from the third day, when Leonidas sent the allies home because it had become became clear they were about to be overrun.   \n\nkk so the 3000 Greeks have held Thermopylae for two solid days, holding off an army of between 750,000 and 2,000,000 soldiers -nobody can agree how many, everybody agrees it was fucking huge, composed of the pledged armies of every nation under the Persian empire.  \n\nthe Greeks are holding due to a combination of a strong military formation called phalanx (a wall of big shields and long spears constantly pushing forward) and a near-perfect defensive position - the Persian army  is forced to funnel up a relative narrow corridor with a sheer mountain on one side and a sheer drop on the other, they can't ever make use of their absurdly overwhelming numbers.  \nthey are holding, but it's only a matter of time how long they can hold.  the Greeks will tire, their losses will mount and their line will eventually degrade, falter and collapse and then they will all die.  every Greek there is keely aware - *it's just a matter of time.*  \n   \ntwo full days, sunup to sundown, three thousand guys held that pass.  \n\non the third day, it comes to Leonidas' attention that Xerxes has learned about a passage in the mountains that will allow him to bypass Thermopylae and ultimately surround the Greeks.  this is it, it is over, they cannot hold any longer, they are about to be surrounded and overrun and any Greek still at Thermopylae *will* die.  \n \nso Leonidas sends everybody else home, the 300 Spartans (plus slaves, shieldbearers, etc) are going to stay behind, they will hold the pass as long as they can.\n\nXerxes sends one final envoy, offering one last chance to give up.  'lay down your arms,' Xerxes' message reads.  \n\n'come and take them,' Leonidas replies.\n\nthat's the context missing from those stickers you may have seen on the back of suvs and oversized pickup trucks. \n Leonidas was offered a choice between surrender or slaughter and he told them to go fuck themselves.\n\nthats what's happened here, on snake island.\n\nthat's what 'russian warship, go fuck yourself' is.\n\nLeonidas would have been proud.",

There was a time during the Greco-Persian Wars of Xerxes that the Spartans refused to assist the Athenians due to a religious festival. (That would be during the battle of Marathon.)\n\nSecondly. You present the Spartans (and Greeks in general) as the \u201cgood side\u201d here. It is important to note that the Greeks were no better than the Persians. Sparta was an oppressive, proto-fascist diarchy, and Athens was a failed \u201cdemocracy\u201d that was basically ruled by a council of 12 nobles. Persia, on the other hand, though an absolute monarchy, was also by the standards of the time a peaceful, prosperous, and free nation. Conquered Persian people were allowed to practice their religion and keep their culture in peace. Cyrus the Great returned deported Jews to their homeland and gave them money to build the Second Temple. And the Persian satrapy system made a very efficient bureaucracy. All in all, the whole \u201cevil, authoritarian, east\u201d vs \u201cgood, Democratic, west,\u201d is a very Eurocentric and frankly racist worldview.",
