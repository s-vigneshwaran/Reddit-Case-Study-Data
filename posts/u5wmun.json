  "text": "TIFU by letting my gf suck my dick in front of her brother\n(Throwaway because duh) \n\nSo last night me, my girlfriend (both 22) went out clubbing with her younger brother (18) to celebrate him being able to drink legally. We didn\u2019t wanna pay for a hotel so we borrowed their parent\u2019s little caravan and at about 3am we all went back to the caravan all very drunk. \n\nMy girlfriend has a habit of getting VERY horny when she\u2019s drunk, which normally is great, but she also has absolutely zero boundaries or logic when in that state beyond sexual urges. \n\nWe had to share a double bed inside the caravan, obviously I was expecting us all to sleep straight away, but literally 2 minutes after we laid down my girlfriend was pulling my pants down, and she started to suck my dick. Her brother was on the other side of the bed, he was pretty drunk and saw this happening and just laughed at it, I felt kinda weird at the time but I was also pretty drunk and just let it happen. He obviously didn\u2019t watch the whole time but he did look back and forth and kept laughing at it. \n\nAnyway it\u2019s the morning now and they\u2019re both still asleep and the regret is starting to sink in, I have no idea how I\u2019m gonna look him in the eye after this, and I\u2019m kinda just worried that this will have long term repercussions for him and her. Gonna be a fun day. \n\nTl;dr got my dick sucked, regret",

I got so insanely drunk that I asked my friend (also very drunk) who used to do Muay Thai to kick me in the thighs multiple times. He would go easy on me for the first couple ones and asking me constantly if I am okay but I was telling him 'It's nothing. Kick me harder so I can feel it' - so he did. He got 4 strong ones in since I stood pretty firmly before I sat down and proceeded to cuss him out for about 10 minutes. After the cussing session I puked and went to sleep. I woke up the next day with a terrible hangover and an unimaginable amount of pain in my left leg. My thights were swollen to about 1/3 of their original size. I wasn't able to walk properly for 2 weeks and wasn't able to train legs for about 2 months. I couldn't drive a car for a week because I couldn't push the clutch pedal to the floor fully. Worst part of it was telling this to my girlfriend. I was incredibly embarrassed by how stupid I was. I tried to tell her that we had a squat contest while drunk when I got home but eventually told the whole story. She just laughed a lot and told me how stupid I was. To this day, I don't understand why I did it.",

I did way too much for her before this all happened (100% of the cooking and cleaning, dropped her off at work picked her up at work the whole 9) and I think I was honestly sick of it which fed into my unconscious fuck up. Then I just kinda turned it up and did much more for her to make up for it. Still cooked, still cleaned, found her an apartment, moved her in, mounted her tv up, assembled the couch we bought together before the events described in that new apartment. I was fucking sick that she told her family about it but didn't say that we were trying to work things out and went into a deep state of depression. After all of that she finally told me she wanted to get back together and I said that I didn't know what to do. So I flipped a coin. It came up no, and so I drove her to her new apartment and never spoke to her again. I gave her the coin to keep.",

I looked at it for the first time in over a decade a couple of years ago and they actually just play the same boring mainstream all the other cable channels seem to show.  Really quite shocking.",

These individual pieces are much more pleasing to the palate (to me) for some reasons.  Once I started doing it it\u2019s been hard to stop, biting ACROSS the sections or slicing them ACROSS the sections just seems funny to me now.  Like if you peeled an orange, would you bite it ACROSS the sections or eat it section by section ?  I apparently barely remember the movie because I don\u2019t even remember this being in there, but if it\u2019s in there this is most likely where I learned this evidently very obscure but life changing bit of information.",

Especially if you've gone from sleeping in a queen all by yourself and then try to go to a double bed. That's miserable. Happy that you and your wife like your double bed. Whatever, good for y'all. But it would fucking be miserable for us and I think most couples agree, it isn't fun. I have some close friends that did it until she got pregnant and they decided that they hated it. Shockingly (/s), he's a good 4\" shorter than my husband. Of course it's more comfortable for him. His wife is very petite. But once she got pregnant they just couldn't do it anymore. So I think maybe you should reevaluate your stance on this. Sure, it works for you guys. It doesn't work for everyone and that's fine. But being rude is always unnecessary.",

Me and gf laid down to go to sleep, and about 15 minutes later we could hear other girl\u2019s gluck gluck noises on the other side of the room. I sort of leaned up to get a look because I wasn\u2019t sure what I was hearing at first. My boy just had his head leaned back and this chick was going to town on his dick like no one else was in the room. Good times.",

We didn\u2019t wanna pay for a hotel so we borrowed their parent\u2019s little caravan and at about 3am we all went back to the caravan all very drunk. \n\nMy girlfriend has a habit of getting VERY horny when she\u2019s drunk, which normally is great, but she also has absolutely zero boundaries or logic when in that state beyond sexual urges. \n\nWe had to share a double bed inside the caravan, obviously I was expecting us all to sleep straight away, but literally 2 minutes after we laid down my girlfriend was pulling my pants down, and she started to suck my dick. Her brother was on the other side of the bed, he was pretty drunk and saw this happening and just laughed at it, I felt kinda weird at the time but I was also pretty drunk and just let it happen. He obviously didn\u2019t watch the whole time but he did look back and forth and kept laughing at it. \n\nAnyway it\u2019s the morning now and they\u2019re both still asleep and the regret is starting to sink in, I have no idea how I\u2019m gonna look him in the eye after this, and I\u2019m kinda just worried that this will have long term repercussions for him and her. Gonna be a fun day. \n\nTl;dr got my dick sucked, regret",

It was a good party and we weren't made to feel like the kids of the party.\n\nWe end up leaving her place and go barhopping. The night moves on and she starts flirting. I was beyond intimidated, her being very attractive, her male friends being guys I would love to drink with, but not fuck with, if that makes sense, and of course, her being my friends sister.\n\nI end up missing my bus home, and I lived a good 45min by bus away, so she invites us to sleep at her place. We all end up sleeping in her bed, and she decided that she would sleep between us. As one could imagine, I didn't fall asleep in a flash. \n\nAfter a while, she starts making moves. Pushing her ass against my junk, making small noises etc. I was not very receptive. Then, she just reached back, took my hand, and put it on her til, then in her panties, and in the end we ended up fucking, subtly, while her brother \"slept\".\n\nThere were no hard feelings between them, or us afterwards. It was awkward the next few times we were all gathered, but it's all good now, and we're all friends. He did admit that it felt weird being there though. But we all laugh at it today.",

We didn\u2019t wanna pay for a hotel so we borrowed their parent\u2019s little caravan and at about 3am we all went back to the caravan all very drunk. \nMy girlfriend has a habit of getting VERY horny when she\u2019s drunk, which normally is great, but she also has absolutely zero boundaries or logic when in that state beyond sexual urges. \nWe had to share a double bed inside the caravan, obviously I was expecting us all to sleep straight away, but literally 2 minutes after we laid down my girlfriend was pulling my pants down, and she started to suck my dick. Her brother was on the other side of the bed, he was pretty drunk and saw this happening and just laughed at it, I felt kinda weird at the time but I was also pretty drunk and just let it happen. He obviously didn\u2019t watch the whole time but he did look back and forth and kept laughing at it. Anyway it\u2019s the morning now and they\u2019re both still asleep and the regret is starting to sink in, I have no idea how I\u2019m gonna look him in the eye after this, and I\u2019m kinda just worried that this will have long term repercussions for him and her. Gonna be a fun day. \nTl;dr got my dick sucked, regret\n\n-u/hmmalittlestrange",
