  "text": "TIFU by thinking getting constant UTIs was normal.\nSome backstory: I used to get a lot of UTIs. Like, _a lot_ a lot, no matter what I did. Boyfriend and I would both shower before sex, I would pee immediately after, I drank water like a camel, took urinary health supplements, everything I could think of. I would still get 8-12 of them a year, a couple of which turned into kidney infections and landed me in the hospital. I was constantly on antibiotics, and at one point I was prescribed an antibiotic to take every time after I had sex. It destroyed my gut bacteria and pH balance down there, and I was miserable and in pain constantly. \n\n\nI was told pretty much the same thing by every doctor I went to: I need to pee after sex, drink more water, etc. I told them I was already doing all of these things, and they said some women just get them more frequently than others for some reason.\n\n\nThe last time I ended up in the ER with a kidney infection, the kind ER doctor told me that in his 45+ years of practicing medicine, he had never seen a healthy young woman have that many UTIs. There is absolutely something wrong, and I need to see a specialist about it ASAP. \n\n\nFast forward 4 weeks and a referral to a urologist later, my doctor runs a series of tests. One of these tests is a uroscopy which, if you\u2019ve never had one, is where a very small camera is inserted into your bladder through your urethra and is just about as pleasant as it sounds. It didn\u2019t take my doctor long to discover the cause of my constant UTIs: there was a growth/tumor in there. It had formed a pocket which the doctor said was collecting bacteria, contributing to both the frequency and severity of my UTIs being increased. \n\n\nSince there was no way to know if this was a birth defect, a benign growth, or literal cancer without a biopsy, surgery was scheduled immediately to have it removed. The biopsy found that it was not cancerous, which I am infinitely grateful for. Since recovering from surgery, I have not had a single UTI, have gotten off antibiotics, and am able to have a normal sex life with my boyfriend without the fear getting sent to the hospital. My fuck up is that I suffered for years and years instead of getting help, thinking that what I was going through was normal.\n\n\nTL;DR My constant UTIs were being caused by a growth inside of my bladder, and I spent years suffering before getting treatment because I was told women getting frequent UTIs was normal.",

I have multiple rare illnesses as well (including IIH and an unknown connective tissue disorder) and when it's not an easy answer, doctors will be so quick to just say they don't know instead of actually giving a shot at trying to put the pieces together.

However, in the clinicians defense, it's not putting 2 and 2 together. EDS was undiagnosed and rare, and you mention chronic showing that this was not shortly after childbirth making the chance of CSF leak extremely small. So you have a suspicion of 2 and an unknown number which together add up to another unknown number. You have a wide panel of testing, do you expect a brute force approach to this?",

I know time is limited but the time wasted with so patients fruitlessly jumping around offices, returning over and over again after trying senseless treatments is probably even worse than the 30 mins of literature research one could take to at least direct someone better. No you are not proving anything but you rarely ever are, you're taking a guess based on the limited data you can easily collect and figuring out treatment. \n\nDoctors could have Dr. Googled my example above in 10 seconds to admit that no, positional hearing loss and it taking a few minutes upright for the headache to start at times is not an \"odd presentation\" (their words) for a CSF leak and that experience just left me flabbergasted and beyond words. Took 2 weeks until they'd give me a blood patch and they insisted on increasing my risk of a head cancer significantly by giving me a CT scan to rule out brain blood clots first (I was already on blood thinners, asked the doctor what symptom I described was even remotely resembling a brain blood clot, and he couldn't even answer! This was after they assessed I did not have a brain blood clot at the hospital by giving me oxycodone and seeing if the pain went away (it did so they decided not a clot, although if they were concerned why didn't they do a CT scan THEN??) and off I went for a pointless hours long procedure in the ER first, after which the blood patch fixed everything unsurprisingly).",

If spinal fluid leak is indeed 1 in 10, and we almost never do a blood patch, that means most of those leaks will solved without intervention! That's a great solution - to let the body heal itself!\n\nIf we do a 'simple' blood patch, you can have very serious consequences. The venous blood needs to tapped completely sterile and injected completely sterile as well. As perfect as we try to do this, even if only one in a hundred is non-sterile and of those, only one in ten will develop an infection, you have a 1:1000 risk of developping an spinal infection. Now, the only thing we need is the incidence of spinal leak requiring a blood patch to calculate the number needed to treat/harm. \n\nSuppose 1:1000 eventually end up actually requiring a blood patch, if you were to treat everyone with a blood patch, you will need to treat 1000 patients, while only one patient will actually benefit from it, meanwhile those other 999 are exposed to a 1:1000 risk of spinal infection. In other words, to save one person from undergoing delayed diagnosis and headaches, we give someone else a spinal infection. \n\nNow this may shift depending on actual incidence rates, but this is precisely the doctors job - to do no harm.

A doctor who's been in practice for 40 years like my former PCP should not have mistaken asthma for pneumonia for *nine months.* Especially not when i was seeing him every 3 weeks over that nine months. \n\nNone of which is touching on that fact that as a woman, im more likely to be disregarded out of the gate anyways. Im also fairly young. I was 23 when i was going through this and my doctor often patronized me for my age. This isnt the first time ive been patronized and misdiagnosed either for a fairly common condition. I had to go through four seperate OBGYNs to get diagnosed with a hereditary condition that my mom, maternal grandmother, and two older sisters all have.\n\nThe fact is that far too many doctors are not actually doing their jobs and properly diagnosing people.

                              "text": ">I don't understand why you wouldn't want to try to figure out what is actually wrong with your patients. Like none of them even seem interested. As a scientist I find it strange, and while I know clinicians have busy schedules, how is it that there are so few who even start to want to put 2 and 2 together? It's like complete disinterest - like why are you even a doctor??\n\nDamn you put my feelings into words perfectly. \n\nIn August 2019, i came down with what i assumed was some sort of respiratory something or other. At the time, my roommate had just had a cold. She, my fiance, and i all worked at the same call center so my fiance and i both assumed it was just my turn with the seasonal office crud someone had brought in.\n\nExcept it didnt get better.\n\nIt kept getting worse and worse. After a month and a half of it not going away, i scheduled an appointment with my PCP. He listened to my lungs, did a chest x-ray, said it looked like walking pneumonia, and sent me on my way with a script for steroids, antivirals, and tessalon perles. It was stressed to me to take the full run of steroids even after i began to feel better. So i did. And as long as i was taking the steroids, i was fine. But as soon as i ran out? It came right back three times worse. So i went back to my PCP. He did the same shit again. Listened to me desperately wheezing and struggling to breathe, x-rayed me, and wrote me up a script for the same meds. He told me sometimes it takes a couple rounds. \n\nThis went on until MAY 2020. For a little while, i was convinced i had to have been unlucky enough to somehow pick up an early covid infection because back at the beginning of covid, they described it as an \"aggressive recurrent pneumonia-like illness.\" But i got covid tested about 5 times and came back negative. I wasnt spreading my illness to anyone. I was just drowning in my own lungs all the time. Finally, it got so bad and my body was so weak, i passed out during work and my fiance had to rush me to the ER. They gave me an albuterol sulfate nebulizer treatment which was the first medication in *months* that allowed me to breathe normally. They asked why i didnt have a rescue inhaler since i was clearly showing all signs of being severely asthmatic. I was completely taken off guard by this and they told me to schedule an appointment with my PCP and get a referral to an asthma, allergy, and sinus center. Yeah, a month later i was officially diagnosed with severe treatment resistant asthma and placed on a maintenance medication called Breo Ellipta by an asthma specialist. My lungs are damaged af from where i suffered through almost 9 months of lung inflammation and improper treatment. My asthma specialist has told me that its highly likely i will be on my maintenance medication for the rest of my life due to how long i went without proper care. \n\nI dropped my PCP because of it. I just didnt feel like i could trust him after i ended up in the ER and with permanent lung damage because he failed to look deeper into what was wrong despite the increasing severity of my condition. Many times i told him the treatment was less and less effective. And he blew me off, questioned if i was *really* taking the medication properly as directed, and treated me like i was being a dramatic little girl. The experience really stuck with me and tbh, i havent found a new PCP since because i dont want to be disregarded like that again. The apathy i saw in the medical profession really shook me and im hesitant to put myself at risk of being treated like that again.",

I still need to do my job properly no matter how \"overworked\" I am, if doctors are too \"strained\" to do anything useful, why even exist?

I go to the ob. \u201cWow! This is fascinating!\u201d  - not something you want to hear from a doctor. \n\nTurns out, they sewed my bladder to my vaginal wall. Vesicovaginal fistula. That unusual discharge? That was pee, coming out of my vagina. Fucking bonkers. \n\nAnyway, had an exploratory surgery (& hysterectomy) to repair it. Turns out, hysterectomy also can cause same thing. So it happens again, except no doc, specialist, OB, whatever can figure out where it\u2019s at. I\u2019ve been through so much stupid testing, it\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019ve been put under anesthesia over 30x in the past 7 years. I\u2019ve had a dozen or more cystoscopies.

Collected all that and sent it in. And yes, it\u2019s fucking urine. \n\nMy last doc was super cool though, but he got really frustrated he couldn\u2019t find it and figure it out. \n\nSo, I\u2019ve put it on the back burner again because going to see docs every month and getting procedures every month or so is exhausting.

It\u2019s been a cool way to learn more about the mechanics of my illnesses! It makes me happy to let new docs see something rare, and happy that they\u2019ll reference the experience later in their career (and hopefully save someone from what I went through). Good docs are out there, remember they\u2019re people and it\u2019s okay if you two don\u2019t gel as humans.

Long term relationship is especially important as an outpatient.  Moving on to the next thing on the differential does not make you wrong. Integrating new data is how this works. \n\nOn the inpatient side we talk about a few days of progression/resolutions prior to re-evaluation.

It\u2019d be unlikely for a doctor to jump straight to the zebra until they\u2019ve exhausted all possible treatments because different treatments work differently on different people. Also, the zebra diagnoses usually require way more testing and the reason doctors prefer not to do that is actually to protect the patient from unnecessary invasive procedures and blood taking etc.",

Although, now we have laws in place such as 'Ryan's Rule' which means that if we think the doctors are being 'lazy', patients can ask for immediate review - though the reason that this rule was introduced was not due to laziness but to misdiagnosis.",

Most of the time. Not diligently. \n\nA military-ish analogy: there\u2019s a difference between information and intelligence. \n\nAn example of information is audio of intercepted radio communications. When someone qualified/backgrounded to do so analyses it the conclusion they reach about what it means is intelligence. \n\nThe job of the person monitoring radio is to collect intercepted comms. If that person decides to pick and choose what to give to the analysts we\u2019re going to end up with shit intelligence. Maybe \u2018the cat is sick\u2019 is code or maybe the analysts heard lots of audio from other places about sick cats and this adds up to a potential catastrophe (hehe). \n\nWhat you want to do is intercept and record the radio chatter. You won\u2019t get it all, that\u2019s cool. Important: a day with no radio chatter is info (coz why was no one talking on radio that day? Or was it blocked out?) Record that too. Give collected info to analysts. \n\nA good pain day or day where you feel ok and get shit done etc is a day with no radio chatter. That\u2019s info. Could be critical info that contributes to good intelligence. \n\nUndiagnosed chronic illness can mean you\u2019re used to a bunch of stuff and don\u2019t know it\u2019s abnormal. Turns out pooping clear mucous isn\u2019t normal. If you ask me if I\u2019ve had abnormal bowel movements I\u2019ll be thinking \ud83e\udd14 hmmm poop a few times a week and going through one of those clear mucous poop phases \u2018nope! all normal!\u2019 \n\nWhen info becomes intelligence the analysts come back to you and ask specific questions. Once it became obvious stuff was very wrong overall I started getting questions like \u2018ok so what does normal bowel movements mean for you?\u2019\n\nEdit: to get attention of u/DisastrousGarlic110",

If it wasn't responsive I had another type of antibiotic to swap the daily preventative with that was harsher.\n\nI also took D-Mannose (the sugar that makes cranberries effective for UTI) in its pure form about 3x daily with a full glass of water each time.\n\nIf the infection escalated to my kidneys I would go in and have antibiotics injected directly. They inject it into your glutes. It hits like a truck and makes you tired and sweaty.\n\nAnd when those stopped working because I developed a resistance to the antibiotics, I was put on a drug called Methenamine. When it's processed by your kidneys, it essentially turns your pee into something formaldehyde-esque and it burns and sterilizes on the way out. If you don't drink enough with it, it hurts so bad it's like having a UTI anyways. You need to pee constantly on it and it smells terrible and makes you smell like embalming fluid.\n\nAs a long term side effect of this, I really think I now have a systemic form of candida and have a permanent allergy to bladder pain meds (pyridium).\n\nI also still get them about twice yearly or so.

I once had a doctor refuse antibiotics even though I was having my typical symptoms. Then a week later, I went to my primary care doctor for a check up and asked them to test my urine as I was still feeling symptomatic and what do you know they find a UTI and provide antibiotics. Now, I always insist on antibiotics since like I said, I don't get them terribly often and I rather go on a round of antibiotics before ignoring it and letting it get worse. \n\nAlso low grade UTIs can go away on their own with increasing water intake. It doesn't mean you didn't have a UTI if it goes away on its own. It's a risk I rather not take.",

After the hormones of birth and breastfeeding, I was doing it rather weakly, but it would've prolonged my healing process at best and made it a life long problem at worst. \n\nI strongly advocate pelvic floor therapy after birth for anyone because you never know if it's just waiting to happen. I was pregnant with my second when it first happened, then two weeks after he was born, it happened again. Pregnancy couldn't push it back into place that time.",

                  "text": "Hm. those are definitely two different issues, although of course if you don't listen to your patients then you will have a higher rate of misdiagnosis. It's certainly very common that we are wrong about what's going on with the patient; real medicine is nothing like Dr. House where there's an \"aha\" moment and everything is 100% clear, and if only your doctor is smart and creative and sassy enough, they'll always arrive at the right answer. There's a process that we use to investigate each patient at each stage, and the objective isn't always a confirmed diagnosis, it's that we understand enough of what's going on that we can use the tools we have in the best service of the patient. For instance (and this is a  story of one of many patients like this), if a patient presents to my clinic for back pain, and I get a good sense of what's going on internally based on the history and physical exam, and have done my due diligence with the history and exam to make sure nothing is happening that's an emergency, then I might refer someone to physical therapy with particular recommendations about what I feel is going on. If they get better, then great, that gives me even more information (and of course good that the patient gets better). If they don't get better, maybe I ask different questions or do different physical exam maneuvers, and maybe if it seems like an issue may be with the hip instead of the back and throwing off the kinetic chain, at which case I might do a diagnostic injection of the hip and/or obtain imaging, and often I will have been wrong. It's the nature of medicine that you can't do every test or ask every question for every patient, and seeing how things evolve over time is *part of the diagnostic process.* With the woman above, does every patient with a UTI need an investigation for a tumor? Absolutely not. But for someone with recurrent UTIs that are not responding to usual treatment, that's a different story. Catching every diagnosis right away is impossible, and if you are catching every diagnosis right away, you're doing too much, overspending healthcare resources, wasting patients' time/energy/insurance dollars and catching incidental findings that are just further confusing your diagnostic process.",

I grew up in the medical community due to the professions of both of my parents and took to being my own advocate readily, but I know many people that are in thrall of their physician -- never asking why, or for more information, or pointing out where something seems inconsistent.\n\nIf there is a real difference between how men and women are treated, I suspect it is due to societal conditioning which has discouraged women from being more assertive about their health care.  I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I think this is worth consideration before defaulting to sexism as the answer.",

Unfortunately there is an epidemic of people working as \"providers\" misrepresenting themselves as medical doctors (shoutout r/noctor), and even educational institutions churning out cheap and easy online \"doctorates\" to enable this deception.  \n My LPT: if you are in the US, ALWAYS ask if your \"doctor\"/\"provider\" is a *physician*, no matter how small you might think your issue is - because you are entitled to be seen by a physician, **and your insurance will bill the same way regardless**.",

Turns out after many years of hearing \"you shouldn't get these so often\" and the same BS you were given, I found out I had loads of cysts in my bladder while they were doing surgery for endometriosis. This was apparently contributing to the repeated infections and no one just cared to listen when I kept saying I was trying to do everything right and it just wouldn't go away.\n\nI hope you're feeling better, and you fired your last AH doctor for not taking it more seriously.",

I used to get them all the time - I take a bunch of supplements and I found this company called Uqora that has a drink that flushes out your urinary tract. I also was prescribed the after sex antibiotic and I usually will swap between the Uqora drink & the antibiotic, depending on what the activity is afterwards because sometimes it\u2019s very inconvenient to mix a drink. I also take a probiotics so my gut and PH are fine at least for now. But anyway. It\u2019s been awhile for me since I\u2019ve had one but I\u2019m still scarred!

She kept insisting that I need to tell the truth and that \"there's no way a college aged guy hasn't had sex\" (no, she wasn't complimenting me - I'm not a good looking dude, so it's not like she was like \"nah, there's no way people aren't lining up to bone you\").  Like sure - a dude is totally going to lie about NOT having sex in America, right?  Fucking dumbass. \n\nAnyway, after I stood my ground and kept saying that I didn't have sex and that I am pretty sure I got a random infection or that it was a prostate tumor, she finally relented and said I can get a UTI test and gave me Cipro, but that she didn't believe me because \"men don't get UTIs unless they get it from sex\".  After a month of not hearing back (and feeling better after doing my Cipro about two week) I called and asked if they had my results yet because I'd been waiting a long time. \n\nShe sheepishly said that I was indeed infected by E. coli  (which is a non sexual infection).",

Less of a you fuck up and 100% a them fuck up\n\nYou're trying to tell me to take into account the context of my reply as being in a reply to a personal anecdote, but are failing to take into account your quoted \"OC\" wasn't the OC at all, it was a reply to a general statement. The person I responded to didn't offer their anecdote as a personal experience, they offered it as a *general* experience, please pay careful attention to the wording:\n\n>My partner and members of her family have and **do struggle** with getting diagnostics regardless of the gender of the doctor.\n\nNotice the tense? They aren't sharing a solid personal experience that they've had, they're sharing their interpretation of a continued struggle, meaning they're injecting a lot of subjectivity into it. We're left with the impression that they *know* it will happen again, how can they know? Compare that to my anecdote, where I explicitly talk about something solid that happened in the past:\n\n>For god's sake, I broke my arm and the doctor said it's not worth x-raying because \"if I can move my fingers it's not broken\" and I had to advocate for myself to get an x-ray, which proved it was broken.\n\nNotice how all of my verbs are in the past tense? I'm not trying to imply I am discriminated against by using present tense verbs, I'm just sharing an example of something happening.\n\n>I understand that\u2019s not what you were trying to do, but your comment was formulated in a way that flags that for most people familiar with reddit/the internet in general.

They could be currently struggling to get diagnostics, and they can reasonably assume they will continue to (given both their personal experience, and the statistics backing that up).\n\nTheir interpretation of their own struggle is exactly that. Their interpretation. Ask some American Christians if they believe they're persecuted. The difference is the statistics that back it up, which no one was providing. That's what separates the two groups, it's far past time to start emphasising it.\n\n>I feel like an easier way to bridge the gap is to avoid language commonly used by people trying to dismiss those things.\n\nThat bridges absolutely no gaps. If people aren't willing to listen to someone like myself, that is entirely convinced of the problem but just wants some rigour injected, what on earth makes you think they'll ever be able to bridge the gap to someone that isn't convinced of the problem?\n\n>No one has an issue with you sharing your experience, but the language/structure you used comes off as critical and dismissive of the OC\u2019s comment unnecessarily.\n\nOnly if you're intentionally taking an adversarial approach to my comment. Anyone keeping an open mind and a inquisitive outlook will absolutely not take anything as critical or dismissive about what I said. Especially because, again, I *explicitly* say the exact opposite of critical or dismissive. Seriously, you seem to be forgetting this point - the things you interpreted I *explicitly* said the opposite of in the first reply, that's how bad your interpretation was.\n\n>If it would be helpful, I can show you (my opinion of) a more communicative way that your original response could be phrased, that it doesn\u2019t run into these problems in the future.\n\nNo, that's not even slightly useful. I'll give you an example of why by telling you about something that happened to me:\n\nI'm extremely left wing for the Anglosphere. I'm far left of Bernie Sanders. I'm somewhere over where Jeremy Corbyn from the UK is. I'm in favour of UBI/negative interest rates, I'm in favour of people not having to work, I literally spend my life automating jobs in an attempt to push us further towards not having to work, I'm a strong advocate of LGBTQ+, of anti-racism, anti-facism, you name it, I'm there for progress. I was raised completely and utterly without any interest in race, so much so that when I was young and I was trying to describe Samuel L Jackson, I described him as the \"bald dude with the purple lightsaber\" - it didn't even *occur* to me to describe him as black because honestly, it didn't register *as a character trait*. I don't say all of this to try and convince you of any property about me except that I'm certainly not a conservative. However, [I am someone that believes in hearing dissenting opinions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/vtrdbm/comment/if980ll/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), because I accept that I am human and often wrong, and would like to learn. So I do on occasion attempt to engage with people that seem more reasonable from /r/conservative, because although I disagree with them, that may simply be because I haven't heard a good enough argument to convince me of their view. This in turn has got me banned from /r/WhitePeopleTwitter, simply by having ever posted in /r/conservative. So you see, the problem isn't \"getting along\" - I don't need help \"softening my language\". I need help getting people fucking listening to the other side. /r/WhitePeopleTwitter are *so* against even seeing a dissenting opinion *that they ban anyone that has ever posted in a subreddit they disagree with*.\n\nThe problem isn't getting along with people we already agree with. The problem is we are **so bloody polarised** that people are so used to not ever even bothering to understand anyone they think of as \"the other side\" that the discussion has completely stopped.\n\nI don't need help being liked and upvoted, I don't want it. I honestly couldn't give two shits about some random strangers on the internet liking me. I'm not that insecure and I don't need the validation. I need help convincing people like yourself, that seem reasonable, to stop \"flagging\" comments as \"the other team\" and therefore \"wrong\" without actually reading the comment with an open mind to try and understand what the person is saying.",

I tried the OTC stuff first but it got much worse in no time at all so I called my dr and they said I needed to give them a urine sample. I went in and peed in the cup and it hurt so much. My urine was cloudy with very visible white chunks and flecks floating around. They said they test in house and will get back to me in 3-4 hours. \n\n\nThat was 10 am. I waited till 3 to give them five hours and no one called back. Called and left a voicemail. Nothing. Called again at four and left another voicemail. Nothing. Called at 5 and was informed that the office was closed for the day. \n\n\nNext day they opened at 9 so I called and left a voicemail. Called at 10 and finally got the nurse who told me my urine tested negative and they couldn\u2019t do anything. I was upset and pissed and crying. Kept calling back and leaving them messages that there had to have been a mistake because I was in pain and running a fever and by that point it had moved into my kidneys and I was experiencing intense back pain. I was ready to go to the ER but was putting it off as long as I could because, well, money. \n\n\nGot home (I had to work; I\u2019m disabled and need the income) and there\u2019s a message on my machine saying that they made a mistake and called in a prescription for me. Wow. Great. Didn\u2019t even have the decency to call me on the number I\u2019d given them multiple times so I could\u2019ve picked up meds during my break and started taking them. Instead they used a landline number that I told them *not* to use. \n\n\nI\u2019m ready to look for a new dr but from what I\u2019m hearing a lot of places are like this now.

The first thing I did that helped was to try an elimination diet to figure out which foods and drinks were making things worse, if any. I basically only ate rice and water for a week and slowly tried new foods. Anything with caffeine was a no go (coffee, tea, even the small amount in decaf and chocolate caused issues). I also discovered gluten was a big trigger for me as well. I stay away from citrus, asparagus, and any spicy foods because they will cause a major flare up. Food and drink may not be your issue but it's a great place to start! Although discovering food triggers helped, it wasn't 100% so the urologist did a cystoscopy and prescribed a bladder control medication called Ditropan and a bladder pain medicine called Pyridium. I 110% recommend to keep seeing your urologist, but in the meantime try the elimination diet, only drink water, don't wash with soap that has fragrance, take otc AZO if needed, and try and keep a journal.",

Forget where I picked the term up. \n\nTo be honest the situation is ongoing but the nurses finally have a regimen dialed in to keep her comfortable as she passes and her and I got some time to say goodbye. I\u2019ve heard malpractice cases are difficult and maybe I\u2019m just looking for a villain but I feel they missed so many obvious signs. They also discharged on 6/3 missing stage 4 cancer and prescribed sodium tablets and cipro from a UTI and then readmitted on 6/21. They\u2019re lucky she wasn\u2019t a Medicare patient yet or the 30 day readmission would tear them up. \n\nDefinitely my advice to anyone is if you have a good relationship with your parents cherish it and spend as much time as possible and try for deep conversation. If you have a bad relationship that can be salvaged then do it. Also have talks and write down family stories, passwords (password manager is great), last wishes (maybe even prepay), and get your legal and financial house in order. Google how to avoid probate and set that up if applicable and have power of attorney and advanced directives in place. Keep the originals but have digital copies around. \n\nMy mom had most of this setup but not all. Thankfully I was able to get an emergency notary to get the rest resolved. \n\nAlso be prepared for plans to change. Some people revert back to rituals and beliefs from childhood as they get older. Find out what they did to soothe as a kid because you\u2019ll probably be filling in as their parent at some point. \n\nAll in all it\u2019s brutal but much worse to just have found her gone one day.",

She told me citrus is a common irritant, but not sugar. I had her look it up to see that I was right. So I paid a ton of money to see a doctor that I had to teach medical information to\u2026.\n\nI ended up cutting back on sugar and taking hydration seriously and I haven\u2019t had any UTIs since then.

      "text": "This thread is huge so this will probably get buried, but I had a similar experience with urinary pain over the past 2 years.\n\nGot a brutal UTI when I first got together with my boyfriend in May of 2020 and it never really seemed to go away. I was in constant discomfort. Antibiotics made the worst of the pain subside for a bit but every single day I would have a bout of some sort of discomfort for a couple of hours. Sometimes it would come back with a vengence and I would go to the doctor, but my test would come back clear and they would write it off as vaginal sensitivity that I was confusing with urinary pain. \n\nJuly 2021 I started having side pain and a fever alongside the pain. I called telehealth to try to fasttrack some antibiotics but the doctor insisted it was just a muscle stitch (????) and that he wouldn't prescribe antibiotics unless I wanted to go in for another pee test to be absolutely sure. I said I would do that, but didn't even make it because next morning I stood up out of bed and promptly passed out, landing myself in the ER instead. Obviously their test confirmed I had a bladder infection and I was given antibiotics again. At this point I was obsessively taking cranberry pills, peeing before and after sex, washing with antibiotic Dove, and taking D mannose drink packets. Another doctor gave me antibiotics to take after sex as well (which I didn't do, just kept them on hand in case I had another fever/side pain flair up). The daily pain persisted, and I found myself with a weird lapse in health coverage so I couldn't badger a doctor into sending me to a urologist. \n\nEarly this year I was absently browsing the side effects of an unrelated medication because I felt like it was killing my sex drive and was considering stopping it. Cue the realization that it's most major side effect is that of a diuretic, and I put the pieces together. I had been taking a high dose of a urinary tract irritant daily for *years*. I had been cutting out things like caffeine and spicy food at the order of the doctor when I was at my worst because they can exacerbate urinary issues, but this medication remained. Not a single doctor had bothered to look into my medications, or anything on my chart apparently, when I kept complaining of urinary discomfort but tested negative over and over again. I quit cold turkey and I haven't had any issues since last year and it's been a huge weight off of my daily life. Thank god it wasn't something serious like OP's issues, but being in daily pain for almost 2 years with zero help was fucking awful. The fact that I had to solve the problem myself when it would have been so easy for a doctor to take a quick peek at my history and current medications is absurd.",

      "text": "Be your own patient advocate! I complained about a strange pain that was only increasing in intensity and frequency over about 6 months. The best I could describe it is it felt like when you're a kid and you run and play in the snow and get out of breath and your lungs burn with the cold air. This burning pain would go up my neck and into my jaw where it felt like my jaw was being broken. I had nine ER visits, and three doctors who told me it was nerves, or a result of being slightly overweight, I even had my gallbladder out. I finally thought I was legit dying and called an ambulance again. I called a couple of times the previous months and it made me super hesitant to call again, they were just going to hook me up to monitors tell me that my heart was fine, they saw nothing wrong with anything, and acted like I was a hysterical girl. This time one of the ambulance attendants, who I actually sought out and thanked personally for starting the chain of events that eventually saved my life, simply told me to go to a different emergency room. He said obviously something is wrong and those doctors apparently can't find it. He drove 45 minutes away to a large Hospital who to have a cardiologist in the ER seeing another patient. He immediately admitted me and scheduled a heart cath. That's where they put the little camera and the dye in your heart to check the flow of blood. Immediately after getting the results I was told I needed emergency heart surgery. He said I was about 24 hours from a Widowmaker heart attack. I had two blockages that were 98%, and two more that were 99.5% blocked. I had coronary artery bypass graft surgery, with four bypasses. It took me nearly a year to recover and get back to normal. I'm so glad you just kept insisting something was wrong and had a doctor that listened to you. I wish you much luck.",

Sometimes more than 1 a month, and sometimes to the point of peeing blood. 1 of them landed me in the ER with a kidney infection and I had a doctor tell me if I had waited another day I\u2019d be in ICU with sepsis. (This is the UK btw)\n\n I honestly think I\u2019ve had over 30 utis total in my life. I was on antibiotics for the entirety of those 2 years as i would get an appointment every time I got one and they would just prescribe the same thing over and over. I did everything you explained about peeing after sex, drinking water constantly, taking cranberry tablets. Everything. And nothing stopped them. \n\nWhen they finally let me see a urologist after several months of begging to get a uroscopy, they told me my bladder was fine and nothing was wrong. Getting a camera shoved up such a sensitive area was traumatizing in itself and actually left me with another uti before I\u2019d even left the hospital. They also told me some women are just more prone.. \n\nEventually they just subsided on their own and I\u2019ve only had maybe 3-4 since those hellish years 10 years ago now. Everyone who\u2019s had one knows just how unbearably painful they are. I honestly wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. \n\nI\u2019m really glad you were able to find out what was causing yours and that you no longer get them and can now live a pain free life :) I truly feel that as women, our concerns are not always taken seriously by doctors and they tend to ignore us when we are trying to tell them something is not right. \n\nSorry for the essay, your story really made me want to share mine.",

Oh and I'm case it wasn't obvious by my comment, you didn't fuck up. The doctors did.",

If i had a dollar dor everytime i was tole \"its normal take advil\" id retire.\n\nSo as an adult i decides to get my tubes tied. Well when the sr was doing all his checks and actually looking adound, he noticed my uterus was crushing my bladder :) ya girl was folded over! He fixed it, tied my tubes. And i havent had a UTI or cramps since then.\n\nPeoples. If you think something is weird always ask!!",
