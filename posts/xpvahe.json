Dude would literally brag to me about helping their fellow officers out in these situations and then was surprised when I turned down future dates with him. When I told him I was no longer interested in seeing him he threatened to call cps on me (he knew only that I had I a kid but nothing about our life as I kept that shit personal to people I dated). Nothing ever happened. No\nCps. No cops. Nothing. It was empty threats. And thankfully so. How would I defend myself from this man.

They gained a reputation for causing riots nearly every weekend by tear gassing crowds after the bars closed in LoDo every weekend. They beat people in the alleys downtown and arrested people for made ip crimes all the time. I worked downtown and got locked up one night because a cop overheard me say \"What a dick\" about some dude who skipped on his tab. The cop thought I was talking about him. He hit me in the back of my neck and handcuffed me before I knew what was happening. He then took me into the kitchen of a nearby bar and threatened to really beat me with his buddies in the alley. The next day I saw the judge and my charges were dropped because the cop DIDN'T PUT HIS NAME ON THE REPORT. I was processed through the system and spent a night in jail with multiple cops processing me, knowing that there were no real charges. They fingerprinted me, and I found out later that I was never put in the database when I had to have a thorough background check and fingerprinting. The Denver cops were an organized crime ring at that time.",

I'm not quite sure how to feel about it, really. \n\nTheir property values are going up like crazy on my street because of the new construction, and the taxes are going up as well. People who are renting are getting extra screwed. But, the families who own their houses do have some economic assistance from the city available to them, so I don't think the owners will be completely screwed. I think...

For example:\n\nIt's OK to have sex with \"women children\" that are obtained in war.\n\nAnd the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites ... And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males ... And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones ... And Moses was wroth with the officers ... And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? ... Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. Numbers 31:1-18\n\nWhen thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it ... And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands, thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword: But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself. Deuteronomy 20:10-14\n\nHow shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to wives? ... And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the children. And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man. And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh. Judges 21:7-11\n\nGo and lie in wait in the vineyards; And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh ... And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught. Judges 21:20-23\n\nIt's OK to sell your daughter (no mention is made of age) to a man for him to use as a sex slave.\n\nif a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant ... If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed ... If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, shall he not diminish. Exodus 21:7-10",

I can walk to a clinic a mile from my home and buy fistfuls of it for the equivalent of $7.50 US a dose or thereabouts; even if I sent them individually by FedEx at full price it would surely be less than $150 to get it to anywhere in the lower 48 by the next day, at least somewhere relatively urban-ish.  That\u2019s still a good chunk of change for many people, to be sure, but it\u2019s a hell of a lot less than a kid costs, by orders of magnitude.   \n&nbsp;   \nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s legal to ship the pills to people there, but I would sure as hell be willing to go buy them and send them if there\u2019s any way to get them there without potentially endangering the recipient (I know the mail is a federal jurisdiction, but just because you\u2019re paranoid doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not out to get you, as the saying goes).   \n\n\nI just wish I didn\u2019t feel like you were all inching towards living in Gilead faster and faster with every passing day.

The ethical thing to do is vote the government out and bring in those who will provide proper care for women in dire needs like this.\n\nNow I don't live in the US so I am not sure about which shitshow is being run by which shitty conservative Christofascist government, but if this is one of those states that are arresting women for miscarriage then this is the best way to do it without having to involve the local government.

They have been a blessing to me, but if it weren't for men in power making decisions about women's bodies, they could have grown up with their birth families instead of believing they were 'not worth keeping,' in the words of one of my girls. Try having any semblance of self-worth knowing you were discarded as an infant. More babies in the US will be abandoned and possibly killed by women or young girls who are not mentally or financially equipped to care for them and are unable to exercise their right to terminate an unwanted pregnancy.",

The bigger problem is that in China, there is no social security system. Old people don't get money from the government to live off of once they can no longer work. Instead, they rely on their families to care for them in retirement. The problem is that girls, when they get married, permanently transfer over to their husband's family and take with them a good portion of their parents' stuff (i.e. a dowry, often a traditional expectation in marriage, as well as an insurance policy towards the bride's care in her husband's family). The parents are left high and dry as their daughter leaves their property with half their material belongings, never to return. Who will take care of the parents now? Good question. Compare this to having a son- the parents of a boy gain a family member when he grows up and  marries. Their son's wife is now obligated to take care of them, and they have access to the material wealth of their daughter-in-law's dowry. It isn't always the case that girl babies were killed or abandoned because they weren't wanted. Rather, their parents couldn't keep them because they were a huge liability (not to mention, everyone in this system living a whisker away from extreme poverty).\n\nChina's One Child Policy hasn't worked out too great for boys either. Many of them can't find wives, even with the enormous social pressure to do so, and they are left, alone, to care for their parents and grandparents.",

It's maybe hard to imagine form an US POV, but arresting/prosecuting the mother isn't the important thing for law enforcement in these cases. The mother in most cases will get offered help and assistance / care.\n\nBut then again, this happens on average one time a year in the Netherlands. (17 million inhabitants).\n\nThere's even a place in some hospitals where you can leave your baby behind no questions asked. But as said, it's almost never used.\n\n\\#\n\nBut yeah, with all the things going on in the US it feels like asking people to come forward in this case is just because they want to prosecute the mother.",

These services have customers that are allowing the information to be used to find possible relatives and to plot family trees. They are voluntarily making their personal information allowed to be used for this. If the police were to use the DNA from the dead underdeveloped fetus in the OP and submit it to such a database as trying to find possible relatives, if anyone that has shared ancestors as far back as 5 generations ago, they could be matched to the DNA of the fetus. They can build a huge family tree using publicly available information of all the people who have this shared ancestry, and whittle down the suspect list by many factors such as area of residence, how closely related they are, and likely age of the mother, and end up having an incredibly short list of suspects.\n\nMost people will have 32 great-great-great grandparents, with a few having fewer than that due to varying degrees of incest. Out of your 32 great-great-great grandparents, how many of their descendants are you probably even aware of? For most people, you probably don't know anything about people beyond your grandparents, or maybe for some families their great grandparents descendants.\n\nThe sheer quantity of people who are close enough related to you that could be used to identify your DNA as having shared ancestors is insane. And if enough of those potentially hundreds of people have volunteered their DNA information to be searchable, then someone with your DNA and the determination to find you would probably succeed. Also, these high profile cases have proven that this investigative technique can work to find people that have proven to be very good at not being found. This technique is only going to be developed more and more to make it more effective.\n\nIt's entirely possible that as this technology becomes more readily available and this technique for using these databases becomes more honed, that within our lifetime we will see this becoming a primary investigation technique for any crime scene that has DNA left behind by the person who committed a crime.",

It's maybe hard to imagine form an US POV, but arresting/prosecuting the mother isn't the important thing for law enforcement in these cases. The mother in most cases will get offered help and assistance / care. \n\nBut then again, this happens on average *one* time a year in the Netherlands.

Redditors couldn't even begin to try to empathize with the idea of what it must've been like to be a very young woman who lived in shame and guilt and was essentially forced to carry and hide her pregnancy and then abandon a baby... 1981 rural South Dakotah was not a very tolerant or progressive place and would've been exceedingly cruel to someone in her situation, and the echoes of that certainly emerged when she was arrested and sentenced for her act of desperation decades after the fact. \n\nThat thread really showed how the media and our government can normalize inhumanity and turn even Liberals into people who support some really unjust shit.",

Wade when people were squeamish.  \n\nThat can't happen. \n\nMaking abortions illegal doesn't stop abortions from happening.  It just makes the situation horrible for pregnant women, especially the poor ones.  The horribleness has always been there, it was just that it used to be covered up.\n\nUsed to be in the bad old days Ward and Beaver and Wally came home and June had bled out on the living room floor.  Ward calls the family doctor and convinces the doctor (although the doctor has done it too many times before) to falsify the death certificate to say stroke or embolism or anything but \"bled out on the living room floor from a botched abortion\".  That way the Cleavers can still attend church and school and June can be buried in sacred ground next to the rest of the family.\n\nAs ugly as it is, every raped ten year old, every dead fetus a woman is required to carry, every woman who dies because she can't get treatment for cancer from a spooked medical staff, every dead fetus in a dumpster, and all the other horribleness that keeps coming and coming - all this needs to be reported, and repeated.  Making abortion illegal has an insanely ugly cost, every day, and Republicans' noses need to be rubbed in it every single day.\n\nReally want to get rid of abortion?  Comprehensive sex education, not just this impotent \"abstinence only\" crap.  More Planned Parenthood locations.  More free birth control.    \n\nAbout 60% of women who get abortions already have kids and know how much they cost, and that's why they get an abortion.  Want to stop abortions?  More prenatal vitamins and other help for pregnant women.  Single payer to pay for the birth.  Paid time off to take care of the new baby, the way civilized countries do it.  Free school and school lunches.  Subsidized college.\n\nActually do something to prevent unwanted pregnancies rather than trying to crudely, awkwardly legislate them away.  Give women the financial ability to have another child.  Abortions will go down.",

The park had those auto-flushing toilets, and a lady was puzzled as to why one near her kept flushing, and flushing, and flushing... so she opened the unlocked stall and looked.\n\nThe toilet was trying to flush a newborn baby, but the baby was too large. The placenta had already been flushed along with the afterbirth, so there was no way for ordinary people to remove the baby from the toilet. Bystanders had to hold the baby in the toilet, head just above water. Others raced to call for help. Security and Emergency Services were called to the scene.\n\nAnd the scene was a total fucking mess, the most confused crime scene I've ever been at... A dozen screaming and crying women, a half-drowned newborn baby in a toilet, no mother in sight. Nobody knew exactly WTF was going on, and nobody was calm enough to talk about it for quite awhile. But we had to do our best in the situation we had.\n\nFrom our witness descriptions inside and outside the restroom, Theme Park Security was able to track down the young woman who had been there and to stop the family (still doing rides) for further investigation by the Orange County police within several hours.\n\n*(Side note: YES, there is an Orange County in Florida as well as in your bloody California\u2014go look it up FFS. Yes, some idiot in comments always says that every time I mention Florida's.)*\n\nTurns out a 'rather large and fat' 12-year-old girl from a VERY religious family gave birth in the bathroom. After a ride, she needed to go to the bathroom. And when she 'went to the bathroom' she lost a lot of that 'extra weight' and left it behind.\n\nSeriously, she just left the baby in there and returned to taking rides in the park with her family... but the truly awful thing (about this already awful story) is that the father of the girl was later determined to also be father of the baby...\n\nGood ol' christian conservatism at work! Women belong in the kitchen and the bedroom, right? Even your own daughters. Aren't you PROUD of your religion?",

An unborn baby does not \u201cthink\u201d or have the emotions that a baby born a week ago does.

A person who has feelings, memories, emotions and desires. A fully fledged individual.\n\nSurely it is more ethical to allow women and girls to abort a foetus than force them to undergo permenant physical changes such as gestational diabetes and emotional trauma such as having an unwanted child or having to give away a baby you feel connected to? \n\nWhat is the ethical argument aside from a foetus made from human cells being more precious than any other cells on this planet? Well now we are looking at repeating history with hidden pregnancies, DIY abortions and unsafe \u201cback-alley\u201d abortions. America really is travelling backwards and trying to turn citizens into informants for the christofacist Gestapo.\n\nEdit: changed foetuses not feeling pain until 27 weeks to 20 to 27 weeks.",

It will not be able to process the pain of an abortion the same way a baby or person would. It simply will not. The fear is not there. It will not be conscious of what is happening. Yes, abortion means the death of a foetus and a baby not being born, but the benefits of a safe, legal abortion for a woman who cannot or does not want to be pregnant outweigh avoiding causing potential pain to a developing foetus. That is what anti-abortion activists are using; the fact that a foetus is technically a baby. It isn\u2019t yet. Whereas the pregnant person has all of their own complex feelings and emotions, and so should have every right not to be punsihed for the result of sex, rape or forced to continue a pregnancy which could kill her",

The fact that the response to all the shit the Christian Taliban has been doing since overturning Wade has been so lame, makes them bold and they think they can get away with anything.

Democrats? You idiots kept voting for the morons that eventually lead to roe v Wade being overturned, you can feel disgusted by what's happening now but you should be disgusted with yourself for being too blind to realize that this would be the obvious end result of your stupid actions.",

However the people who get voted into power are either bullied by or are already part of the Christian right. If you look at a lot of conservatives that are politicians in other countries they are pro abortion in most cases. However the US has it ass backwards when it comes to who they elect into power. \n\nThe Christian backing in the US is very high financially and they are exceptionally vocal about it. Where I live you would be hard pressed to find someone who is conservative who doesn't agree that if a pregnancy would harm a mother, is the case of incest, underage or the case of rape, then it would be reasonable to abort it. However in the US it is like \"God will take control of the situation and everything will work out great!!\" and then the baby and mother both die and they are like \"Well they're in God's hands now and it's for the better.\" Fuck no it isn't you dolt. \n\nThere are not many younger conservatives that donate in large amounts to politicians in the US. It is all older conservatives. They are usually high religious and have a ton of money. The majority of the wealth in the US is held by people 60+ and they are still stuck in their ways. The financial inequality for progressive conservatives to financially boost their candidate is very evident when it comes to election time. So all you get are these geezers and Christian fundamentalists who get into power and it's disgusting.",

I'm not saying this is every case, but a lot of cases of unwanted pregnancy could be avoided by using protection or other planned decisions. In the comparisons brought up, there are some cases where you can do some planning to prevent the accident from occurring (drunk driving or horrible gender reveal parties), but most cases are from accidents. However, as im advocating for more sex education, I could understand if you want more driving education to lower those driving accidents.",

Yes, birth control isn't 100% accurate and I (and maybe the original commenter as well) am not saying abortion shouldn't be an option for circumstances in which they fail. I'm just pointing out that engaging in unprotected sex has maybe a tiny sexual benefit for those into that at the cost of a high risk of unwanted pregnancy. Driving on the other hand has a low chance of getting a car accident and is typically for a good reason like working. Of course, I think we can both agree that the fire comparison made was even more of a stretch (except for those infamous gender reveal parties and similar cases). \nI do want to point out that when I said \"high chance\", I evidently havent actually looked at any studies. I am only inferring this info, so I think it would be interesting if actual studies prove me wrong. Maybe studies show that you're more likely to get in an accident every time you drive a car than you are to get pregnant (or impregnate) every time you engage in unprotected sex. That would definitely shock me.\n\nI appreciate your response though. Sometimes these reddit conversations can get nasty because we eventually just start insulting the other person, but I really enjoy reading replies that pleasantly disagree with me. Anyways, my conclusion is that there should be increased focus on sex education so that teens and young adults understand the dangers of unprotected sex.",

It should have been unthinkable such judicial lightweights would ever be nominated let along confirmed by the Senate, but here we are. Family planning (including contraception), not to mention gay rights and possibly even mixed-race marriage will never be as secure as they were before this Supreme Court, until a new constitutional amendment is passed specifically guaranteeing those rights and other \"unenumerated\" rights that the decision struck down.",

However, people do not use condoms perfectly in the real world (*thanks* in part to the conservatives who prevent sex education in schools; if you agree with them, you are also increasing the number of abortions that you hate so much), and with typical use there is 18% annual probability of pregnancy; meaning that over a 10 year span with condoms as the means of contraception, there is an 86% probability of pregnancy, and over a span of 20 years, 98% probability of pregnancy.\n\n> The people who do this stuff are evil.\n\nPeople who force women to carry an unwanted pregnancy and give birth (one of the most painful things humans experience that damage their bodies and carry medical risks and permanent scarring) are EVIL!\n\nEven if a foetus were to be granted personhood,  why should the fetus override the woman's right to bodily autonomy?\n\nIf person A is in desperate need for a kidney, and person B was the only suitable donor, do you think it is right to force person B to give their kidney to person A?",

We can\u2019t all be like you. People have the right to enjoy life, including the possibility to have sex. Some people will get an unwanted pregnancy, but guess what? They should still have access to safe abortions because it\u2019s way better than girls inadvertently killing themselves with coat-hangers - in my opinion anyway, you maybe disagree. But if you do disagree, I think that makes you a heartless pro-death person. You have dead babies lying in creeks now. Rethink your position on abortion.",
