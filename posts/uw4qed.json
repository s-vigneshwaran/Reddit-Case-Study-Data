          "text": "Yep.  This is why the \"strong, independent woman\" is someone with nothing more than a job, car and place... like a normal adult.\n\nThe more I hear shit like that, feminism starts to really look like women are so unhappy with their choices and benefits they just want to be men.  They can't stop talking about men and their standards for being a great woman is basically being a normal, lower middle class man.  It's really starting to look like a movement of envy on top of just raw hate.\n\nThey love to say how strong they are, detailing they are just a normal man\n\nThey love to say they can do anything a man can\n\nThey love to even pretend they can compete with men in sports\n\nThey call men aggressive, but holy shit they are top level aggressive\n\nThey LOVE to say men and women are not different, but we all see plain as day they will claim differences when it suits them.  So they wanna be like men when they can gain, be line women when they can gain.  \n\nThrow on top of that in the dating world of the unreal amount of projection they toss out there.\n\nThis is why they obsess over eliminating men and doing all this shit without men (like the whole we don't need men to reproduce shit), they want to eliminate competition from men more than they want to promote women.  \n\nFeminists just wanna be men, and naturally don't know how because biology is well, biology and testosterone is a hell of a hormone, so they imitate what they think men are at their worst and covet what they want that men obtain (tech jobs, sports, childfree etc.). \n\nIMO, this is why you rarely see an overly attractive, feminine feminist.  Those women are happy being women, they don't wanna be a man, they are feminine.  I think this is why most feminists we see are so unhappy in general, they are jealous of what men have and what feminine women have (hence the \"pick me\" shit).",

I'd rather die then become your disgusting childlike view of what a woman should be. That's not me wishing harm on myself, that's me throwing up in my mouth about your disgusting comments.\n\nI think you need to do some deep thinking, ask yourself why you hate women so much and why you like to create false phrases and glorify virginity (pedophile behavior) and why you view women as some dainty little precious butterfly (again, pedophile behavior) and learn how to not be a weirdo in this little fantasy world you made up. I think it would really do u some good to come back down to reality.\n\nAnd you do wish harm on me. Pushing false narratives is harmful to women. Wishing I would be something other than I am is harmful to me. Let me be me and u fuck off about it.",

It\u2019s not anything overly abnormal like you seem to think.\n\nJust a normal conservative guy speaking his apparently repressed mind.\n\nLike, seriously, I\u2019m not someone who thinks we live in a world of equality or whatever. We do not.\n\nBut for feminism to gain any actual credibility beyond people pretending to agree out of fear while shitting on it from the sides\u2026\n\nYou guys really need to say at least some ***slightly reasonable stuff*** and acknowledge the double standards. Men suffer too, and just as much, if not more than woman, in some areas.\n\nWhile woman also do indeed suffer more with stuff like the job market and safety. \n\nFor anyone to change their views and take you seriously, you need to stop being overly aggressive and annoying.\n\nThis kind of claim is ***precisely*** what turned modern feminism into the joke it is.\n\nIf you guys want support for the cause, then most men are all for it.\n\nYou guys just need to come up with something that even remotely looks like equality instead of whatever the hell is happening nowadays. \n\nThere\u2019s a damn reason why a SUB like this even exists in the first place. It would be outlandish for anyone to ever admit they follow this in real life, and you know why:\n\nAnd it\u2019s because a fuck lot of men live in a reality of fear, since they are absolutely oppressed into shutting their damn mouthes all the time.\n\nOnce freedom of expression actually comes online and both men and woman become able to sit down and talk live civilised adults, I\u2019m pretty sure feminism will actually become relevant again.\n\nThen we could solve shit like safety and the lack of representation in the formal market.\n\nWhile also allowing man to speak about ***their*** problems, which became just as important nowadays.\n\nAnd of course, please stop trying to make the two genders 100% equal in the grammatical sense of it lol.\n\nMen and women are biologically different.\n\nFor us to live in a just society, those differences need to be acknowledged.\n\nIsn\u2019t being weaker the whole reason why safety is such an important matter for woman, after all?\n\nFor this reason, \u201cstandards\u201d for both genders will never die. They will, at best, change with time.\n\nAnd that\u2019s fine.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to live in a society without standards.\n\nIn an utopia, we could live in a place were both the standard and the \u201cdifferent\u201d would be respected. \n\nAnyways, just don\u2019t go around saying shit that discredits your own movement just because you\u2019re pissed with a random dude saying rude stuff.\n\nThis is a disservice to everyone.",
