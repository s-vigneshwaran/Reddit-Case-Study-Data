This is getting weirder and weirder if you ask me lol. Like some gaslighting shit. Literally all I said was that white people shouldn't be genocided and you claimed that's white supremacy. Like what? Can white people say they like their own race and aren't ashamed of their skin color or is even that racist to you?",

You took the genocide out of nowhere to claim something that\u2019s verifiably not true. \n\n>Can white people say they like their own race and aren\u2019t ashamed of their skin color \n\nLiterally no one said that white people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do that. Everyone can like and be proud of their ethnicity. But the 14 words are definitely not about that. For some reason you think they are. I mean \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d is in the phrase for fucks sake. It\u2019s very clear to anyone who finished school what the \u201cAryan\u201d race was about:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism\n> From 1933 to 1945, Nazi Germany, under the rule of Adolf Hitler, promoted the idea of a superior, Aryan Herrenvolk, or master race. The state's propaganda advocated the belief that Germanic peoples, whom they called \"Aryans\", were a master race or a Herrenvolk whose members were superior to the Jews, Slavs, and Romani people, so-called \"gypsies. \n\nThere is a difference between \u201cbeing proud of your race\u201d and and being racist. The 14 words are a white supremacy slogan that promotes the belief that non-white ethnicities should be cleansed out. So really your \u201cgenocide\u201d narrative was pretty backwards. \n\nI suggest you do some reading on the matter. There is really no good reason to excuse supremacy of any race.",

The post was clearly in context of dressing up fully as Kanye, including using black body paint to caricature black skin. That's black face. Putting black on your face is not black face. Putting black on your face in order to dress up as Kanye West is black face, no matter how much you admire him. It is hilarious seeing you floundering around this. \n\n>I don\u2019t defend racist.

Black face is a deliberate mocking of black people and dressing up as them to do it. Black face is racist. Being Ye for Halloween is not. \n\nYou're still being deliberately dishonest. Black face is not limited to deliberate mocking. There are dozens of examples of blackface being used as tributes to Black or dark skin figures (Justin Trudeau for a recent example). Black actors in the 18th and 19th century had to occasionally wear blackface to perform on stages. It is extremely ironic how wrong you are given what sub we are in. Do your own homework. \n\nYou have a strange definition of what counts as racism. \n\n>I\u2019ve never seen Tucker be racist either, although he is an ass and his show IG basically a bunch of yelling at kids to get off his lawn.\n\nTucker Carlson is a racist. There are so many examples of him making racist or thinly veiled racist comments that at this point, you'd have to be sticking your head in the ground to ignore them. I could show you examples, but given your track record I know what you'd say to them. \n\n>I can disagree with people without having to make them an -ist.\n\nSure you can.

Plenty of other people have shown you racist remarks by Stephen Crowder. You ignored them all. I could show you examples of Tucker Carlson being racist, and you'd probably ignore that too. \n\nAnd yea, I gave you examples of how dressing up as Kanye in blackface is racist. You just don't want to admit it. \n\n>I\u2019m not right wing myself. So that has nothing to do with it. I voted for Bernie Sanders. Hahaha you\u2019re still confused\n\n\"I voted for Bernie, but am also against 65% of the things he stands for and also I love Trump now!\" \n\nOh, you're one of those people. You're an absolute riot lmao\n\n>I have a disease on my hands and have to elders glives and you\u2019re not worth going make and checking to make sure everything is typed right.\n\nPoint is, you clearly don't respect people's opinions, so it's very strange to see you get so upset when people don't respect your opinions and instead make of you. \n\n>Bye bye now little boy\n\nBye bye daddy, come back to play some other time!",

Still irrelevant to my question.\n\n>I watched this whole episode (well I suffered through it) and I decided it was in good fun.\n\nRedundant, same as above.\n\n>I\u2019ve never seen Crowder be racist to anyone in anyway.\n\nIrrelevant to my question. \n\n>I think calling someone a racist publicly is a serious allegation and racism is a horrible thing.\n\nirrelevant to my question, and also a trite platitude. \n\n>I\u2019m sad you folks have belittled it so much now that no one is going to believe you anymore.\n\nirrelevant to my question, and also stupid as fuck.\n\nSummary: of all clauses in your response, arguably the only one that comes remotely close to answering my question is that jokes with racial elements/stereotypes are fine unless they are intentionally malicious. \n\nPresumably, a logical consequence of that is that intentionally malicious statements are racist, but you failed to say even that. All you said was jokes categorically are not racist unless they are intentionally malicious.",

At the same time, what do you mean by \"white\"? Are Jewish people not white? Well most Jewish people I've met are. And Turks, yeah maybe a bit more tan. But more akin to the tan you'll see in southern Europe in general. I dunno. White isn't really a thing in the same manner as black.",

I am honestly quite happy that you disagree with me. I would have to question quite a bit about myself if someone as dishonestly racist and na\u00efve as you didn't.

Granted they're both great actors, but it feels like skin colour is the primary factor when presenting them.\n\nCraig was criticized for being blonde, but he wasn't hired because of his blonde hair, he was hired because he fit this iteration of the character so well despite his blonde hair and blue eyes (and age). It was up between him and Henry Cavill, who was rejected for being too innocent/fresh-faced at the time.",

I watched them all. I think they\u2019re good. I wish someone from the left would do the exact same thing. I watch them too. \n\nI tried out his daily show, and realized he\u2019s a \u201ccomedian\u201d and I didn\u2019t like the show much. But I did give it a fair chance. Particularly last year during the election I wanted to see how he was covering it (it was widely popular for some ungodly reason) and what I found was disturbing. \n\nAfter that I stopped giving him a chance. I like both sides (sue me) and think they both have good ideas. But undermining the election was too much. As you can see I was right. I still like his change my mind segments (I don\u2019t always agree with him, but he did change my mind on abortion) if that\u2019s a fan then I guess you can call me that.\n\nI\u2019ll also add I spend time in the sub named after him, mostly to troll lefties that spend time there, but also to see how righties are thinking. It\u2019s less of a crowder sub and more of a right-wing subx \n\nI\u2019m also having a hard time typing today, If I have mistakes don\u2019t make fun please.",

Oh. But I thought you didn't like his daily show and found the content \"disturbing?\" So why stick around and keep making posts on the sub dedicated to a guy you just described as making disturbing comments months after the fact?\n\n\"I like both sides\" my ass lmao. First Crowder isn't racist, then he makes *disturbing* comments (totes just about the election though, absolutely nothing else), then you're a fan, then you aren't, then you kinda are again. Yeesh you could open a breakfast restaurant chain with all the waffling you're doing in this thread.\n\nI'm gonna give you some advice: if a guy is willing to sink so low that he goes all-in on election conspiracies, maybe he's also lying about the stuff you thought you could trust him on like abortion and racism? Because imo it sounds like you're just trusting him on some issues because he says what you want to hear and ignoring the fact that the dude is spreading actual far-right conspiracy theories and is very obviously untrustworthy.",

If I\u2019m being real I mostly troll on here (I\u2019m not that good at it though) and if you look through my profile you see just how wild and crazy it gets. It\u2019s almost over though, I\u2019ve been doing while I was nearly dying to really see what my flesh is like and just how nasty I am. It\u2019s worse than I thought. \n\nBut unless you take back what you said my my religion I have no plans on replying to you ever again.",

I didn't even say anything bad about your faith yet, but *now* I'm gonna. The Abrahamic God is a genocidal and torturous maniac, you're an asshole hiding behind your faith as an excuse, and I think most every organised religion, particularly Christianity, serves as a hotbed of corruption and offers nothing but an avenue to control the gullible and oppress those who don't fall in line.\n\nI look to Satan as a non-literal avatar of self-actualisation and rebellion against unjust power, far more deserving of my respect than you, your faith, or your god.\n\nI truly hope that eventually you'll become a better person, and until that time I hope you continue to be ruthlessly mocked.\n\n<3\n\nBONUS EDIT: Jesus Christ was the world's first communist and I genuinely respect him as a proto-socialist philosopher.",

Especially if Seder is so insignificant like Stephen claims?\n\nHe literally **faked a medical emergency with his pregnant wife to get out of the *possibility* he would come face to face with someone who actually knows their shit**, knows the facts and has a strong understanding of a range of political topics.\n\nAnd then when he has the opportunity to stand up for himself he hides behind his producer and runs away (ironically wearing a \"fight like hell\" shirt) crying like a little kid. Apparently the prospect of a *conversation* with, according to Stephen, just some nobody, is, and I quote, \"a fucking nightmare\".\n\nI just don't know how his reputation can survive that or how chuds like you are still stanning for him. Like do you see how pathetic he came off?? He's so fucking weak and sensitive lol. Sam was 100% the alpha in that situation and it really just showed what a beta Stephen is overall -- no joke, if you wanna think in that frame of reference.",

He knows his audience is all far-right Trump supporters so he caters to his audience.

Which would you choose to obtain? Obviously, you\u2019d choose the chair. That\u2019s because there are many types of chair, produced by scores of different companies and widely distributed. You could buy a $15 folding chair or a $1,000 antique without the slightest difficulty. By contrast, to obtain an X-ray you\u2019d have to work with your insurance company, wait for an appointment, and then haggle over price. Why? Because the medical market is far more regulated \u2014 thanks to the widespread perception that health care is a \u201cright\u201d \u2014 than the chair market.*\n\n\n*Does that sound soulless? True soullessness is depriving people of the choices they require because you\u2019re more interested in patting yourself on the back by inventing rights than by incentivizing the creation of goods and services. In health care, we could use a lot less virtue signaling and a lot less government. Or we could just read Senator Sanders\u2019s tweets while we wait in line for a government-sponsored surgery \u2014 dying, presumably, in a decrepit chair.*\n\n\n -Ben Shapiro\n\n\n*****\n\n^(I'm a bot.

It doesn't matter if it's true as long as it *feels* true.\n\nPerson A makes some post about how Joe Biden eats babies. Person B provides some sort of proof that definitively shows that Joe Biden has never eaten a baby, or never even *thought* about eating a baby. Person A sees the definitive proof and disregards it. Because even though Joe Biden doesn't actually eat babies, it *feels* right, it *feels* like something he would do, so they don't care if it's actually wrong.\n\nSame thing applies here. Steven Crowder has been proven wrong.... But he doesn't care. His fanbase won't care either. You could show them this tweet, you could find the entire history of No Bra Day, you could find a video of the founder of No Bra Day explicitly saying they started it to raise awareness for breast cancer... They won't care. Because even though he's wrong, it *feels* right. It *feels* like something feminism would do to stick it to the patriarchy, and that's good enough for him.\n\n----\n\nI also remember seeing posts on the Donald Trump subreddit back in 2015, they were talking about making memes to sway people to his side. And it was all ridiculous, the only one I remember was \"Hilary Clinton is going to send all your daughters to war!\" And someone in the comments said, \"None of this is actually true, isn't Clinton bad enough as it is? Do we really need to lie to get our point across?\" Which was a pretty good point.... And he was downvoted, and somebody replied with, \"It doesn't matter if it's true or not, the ends justify the means. We need to win this!\"\n\nSo, they're also fine with telling lies. They don't give a shit, as long as they win! \n\nKinda makes you wonder though, doesn't it? If you have to constantly tell lies to get people on your side, maybe your side isn't really as strong as you think it is?",

Why is it not worth it to try? Why is the possibility that a new effort in education may reach some people, even if it eventually joins the noise? Why is that detrimental?\n\nWhy object, assuming one isn't doing so on a basis of general apathy? \n\n> do we need another one when there are other prevalent diseases whose outcomes could be made better by awareness regularly given to breast cancer?\n\nGiven that again one doesn't come at the cost of the other, why not?",

And that same compassion fatigue and apathy is the reason why yet another breast cancer awareness event does come at the detriment of awareness for other diseases, because that\u2019s just another thing we\u2019re being told to care about among everything else. I don\u2019t have a perfect solution, and while I applaud people who put goodwill initiatives together, I don\u2019t believe another breast cancer awareness event is as helpful to preventing breast cancer as an event bringing awareness to a less popular disease would be to preventing that disease.  \n  \nAs an aside, I have enjoyed our conversation.

I don't think you're solving _that_ particular problem by limiting attempts at awareness and education. You tackle that particular bugbear elsewhere - the cost of doing so _here_ is not worth the loss to health and safety or education.\n\nYou might eat when you're sick to keep your strength up, but if you don't take medicine to treat your illness you won't recover fully or easily. Maybe limiting the 'noise' will have short term benefits, but it does nothing to address any long term, big issues like like society and discourse.",

You can detect if something is off just by feeling your own breast tissue, then you get a couple of doctors to feel it, then you go into the MRI, and from there you either recieve more treatments or you're told it's nothing to worry about. I'm supposed to do that every six months until I finally get a double mastectomy to prevent cancer.\n\nI have been having complications with my uterus for well over a year and they even cut me open to look, and they're still not sure what's actually wrong with my uterus. They assume it's endometriosis, but it technically could be ovarian/uterine/cervical cancer. They found no cancer, they found no cysts, they found no endometrial tissue growing where it isn't supposed to. They've done several ultrasounds, they've done blood draws to get counts of markers (which indicates either ovarian cancer or endometriosis, and I did have markers for them), they've done pelvic exams, they've physically cut me open to look at the uterus and surrounding areas, and they still don't know what the problem is. They just ASSUME the problem is endometriosis and that it's growing inside something they can't see, such as inside muscle tissue or inside another organ. So typically, by the time they can recognize cancer in that area, it's typically too late; partially because it's very hard to find apparently, and partially because the symptoms don't typically manifest in a noticeable way until it's either almost too late to do anything, or until it is too late. \n\nSo... for a cancer that is much more uncommon, whose symptoms take a very long time to manifest, which is a difficult disease to even find and diagnose.... I'm not sure what awareness can be brought to it? \"Here's this silent killer! By the time it's found, it'll probably be too late for you!\"",

I couldn't tell you how hard I had to fight just to get a doctor to start trying to diagnose me. They wanted to just put me on birth control, hope it helped, and send me on my way without ever even confirming if I had a gynecological problem in the first place. After my surgery, the doctor told me (while I was still suffering the effects of anesthesia) that the problem MIGHT still be gynecological, but it probably isn't and to go find someone else because it's no longer his area of expertise.\n\nEven if we brought awareness to the problem, we would still be fighting doctors just to be taken seriously. Endometriosis and other feminine health issues such as cancer are some of the hardest to get diagnosed, and I've heard of women fighting for years to get a proper diagnosis of their issues. \n\nI suppose the entire point I'm trying to make is that awareness, while it's cool to do, seems almost like a hollow gesture in a way. Teaching people what to look for is good, reminding people that they're not immune is good, and raising money for either researching how to fight the disease or to help those suffering from it is good... but at the end of the day, are those people going to listen? Is the money being raised actually going to go where it's advertised to go, or is it going to line someone else's pockets? And is all of the awareness going to get doctors to take people seriously, or are they still going to be dismissive and make you fight for your own health? Is awareness actually accomplishing anything at all?",

They can also go for the bumper sticker and tshirt crowd with some extremely diluted \u201cgirl power\u201d (or \u201clol boobs\u201d) messaging for additional $. When backlash inevitably comes for monetizing and trivializing literal cancer, they have some nice PR written up to claim to have been responsible for making people \u201caware\u201d of a common disease. \n\n\u201cMommy, what is a prostate?\u201d and stigma about causes of type 2 diabetes are holding those back for now. And it\u2019s too depressing to watch a parent suffer dementia to put a joke on a mug about. But as soon as someone comes up with a way to make some other condition just as cute and sexy, I\u2019m sure breast cancer will begin to fade off the shelves.\n\ntldr: Individuals care about breast cancer for sincere human reasons.

These are just examples off the top of my head. So again, do we need several breast cancer awareness initiatives a year, or can some of them not raise awareness for other diseases? Bearing in mind, of course, that the human capacity for attention and caring is finite in terms of how many things, realistically, a person cares about, meaning that simply adding more and more awareness and fundraising efforts and expecting people to actually give a shit about them is unrealistic.",

Hopefully some people will be convinced to conduct regular checks, and if so, that\u2019s great. It may prompt some people to check today, and even if it doesn\u2019t become a habit, that\u2019s better than nothing. It may also convince some people to donate to research charities, and again, that\u2019s great. But for an overwhelming majority of people participating, it\u2019s performative. I\u2019m not denying the potential good this event can have, but to say that it is only about that and ignoring the cultural and tribal aspect is deliberately equivocal.",

What I can think might be the reason is the rumor that wearing a wired bra increases the chances of breastcancer. While there is no [evidence](https://www.cancer.org.au/iheard/can-wearing-a-bra-to-bed-increase-your-risk-of-breast-cancer), as a wearer of bras I can very well imagine why anyone would believe it. \n\nIt could be that they are just trying to get awareness for boobs by being braless and with that get attention for cancer? I'm also confused. \n\nBut anyway: free the boob, free the nipple! (just saying).",

Instead, get angry at people who don't manage to know about it by telepathy or osmosis because somehow that makes sense.\n\nWhen you behave this way, it's not about the issue at hand.  It's about your ego and your desire to generate an out-group.  Those of you who get angry at people for not already knowing about this are worse than the guy in the OP because you actually know what it's about and still choose to undermine it.\n\nAnd again, thank you Kassy Dillon for having enough common sense and basic decency to clarify.

Sentiment better\n\nTL;DR excess funding of breat cancer literally comes at the expense of other cancer victims.\n\nAlso at lease one reason breat cancer gets more attention is the better survivability which leads to more living proponents.\n\nBut yup any funding is good funding. \n\nBreast cancer received the most funding by far, at $460 million, accounting for a third of all cancer-specific nonprofit revenue. Next in line\u2014with less than half the funding of breast cancer\u2014were leukemia ($201 million; 15% of total revenue), childhood cancers ($177 million; 13%) and lymphoma ($145 million; 11%). These cancers all received a greater share of funding relative to their proportion of total new cancer cases, mortality and years of life lost.\n\nIn contrast, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver and bile duct cancers, brain cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, sarcoma, melanoma and gynecologic cancers, including ovarian, cervical and endometrial cancers, were underfunded relative to the number of new cases, deaths and years of life lost.\n\nThe researchers found that cancers associated with stigma were poorly funded. These include cancers associated with stigmatized behavior, such as smoking, drinking or sex, as well as those that involve \u201cembarrassing\u201d body parts, like the colon or reproductive organs.\n\n\u201cShame and discomfort with talking about our bowels and \u2019private parts\u2019 may be reducing funding for diseases like colon or endometrial cancer,\u201d according to Kamath.\n\nThe most obvious example was lung cancer, which accounts for the most cancer deaths by far\u2014almost more than the other types combined\u2014but received less than $100 million in funding. Liver cancer\u2014associated with heavy alcohol use and hepatitis B and C, which are frequently transmitted through injection drug use\u2014received hardly any funding.\n\nThe researchers noted that cancers that are \ncommon but typically progress slowly or have a relatively low mortality rate, like breast cancer, have more survivors who can become advocates for the cause and attract more donors. A factor not mentioned by the researchers is the fact that breast cancer affects mostly women, so it receives attention and funding from organizations and political entities that support women\u2019s issues\u2014much as HIV/AIDS has received attention and funding from groups that support the LGBT community.\n\nhttps://www.cancerhealth.com/article/cancers-better-funded-others",
