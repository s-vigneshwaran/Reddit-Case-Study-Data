  "text": "TIFU by eating the hottest peppers I could find while having no sense of taste or smell due to COVID.\nMy FU happened 3 days ago and I\u2019ve just now recovered enough to relive it. \n\nI got COVID for the second time over the weekend and by Monday I had lost all sensation of taste and smell. At the peak of the pandemic I\u2019d joked with my brother in law about running a hot pepper gauntlet if I ever lost my sense of taste and smell from COVID because I *heard* you could handle spicy things. \n\nMind you, I\u2019ve always loved spicy things, but habaneros are usually the hottest I can go. So I started with those, because why not?  And nothing. So I thought, let\u2019s just jump right into one called the Death Spiral, which is hotter than a ghost pepper but not as hot as a Carolina Reaper. \n\nThis is the moment where I think I can pinpoint where my fuck up happened. Nothing. No taste, no spice. So I IMMEDIATELY threw two Carolina reaper peppers down followed by about 10-15 pieces of habaneros and death spiral peppers. About halfway through, my body started to retaliate. I was sweating. I was numb, I felt like I was going to die. But the burn wasn\u2019t there. Until it was. It\u2019s hard to describe. \n\nAnyway, I suffered through the night with awful indigestion and took antacids to try to calm it.  I was miserable. \n\nI didn\u2019t think it could get any worse, but then the moment came where I had to evacuate them. And my god, the pure fire and rage that my sphincter had was unbearable. It felt like satan himself was trying to claw his way out of my rectum. I swore I\u2019d shat blood, but there was none. For hours afterwards I swear the fire feeling that came from my exit hatch could have made s\u2019mores for the entire family. I\u2019m still in pain days later. \n\nTL;dr - lost taste and smell due to COVID, thought it was a good idea to eat the hottest peppers I could find. Paid the price when satan escaped from my ass. 0/10, would not recommend.\n\nEdited typo.",

The fact is if only one reaper had been consumed then as it got diluted going through the intestines the result would be twice as diluted as if two reapers had been consumed. But in this instance perhaps the habaneros actually helped by providing more material in the intestines for the highest concentrations of capsaicin to spread through e.g. extra dilution.",

All the boys ended up getting detention because nobody would snitch. To this day, not adding my mark is one of my only regerts in life (I mean i got punished for it anyway, so why not? FWIW, i take dumps so big its medically significant [i never *don't* clog the toilet, it sucks] so i REALLY could have helped).\n\nAnyway, that's not really battleshits, but i do feel like we won regardless. You should have seen it.. that shit was genuinely impressive given our small size relative to the content of the toilet. And i guess if anyone needed any more evidence that catholic grade school boys are the worst people on earth, well.. there ya go!",

Took 2 bathroom trips in the airport on the way outta baggage claim and couldn't ride the bus home cuz there was no bathroom. I made myself puke to rid my body of said poisonous nuts but just the Jack Daniel's/Ginger Ales came out my nose.\n\nI ended up taking a taxi to the local crack motel and waiting it out. In the morning I walked to the pharmacy chugged half a bottle of Pepto. Then i pack my crack with tissue and rode the sad bus with all my luggage an hour back home. Praying I didn't need to test my prophylactic.\n\n\nMy mom was worried, but I never told her what I ate. And I've never eaten Macadamian nuts ever again.",

It is dead skin.\n\nSo you would, for instance, feel pressure from the nerves UNDER the surface, but you would not feel anything that touched the surface. No taste, no heat, no cold... no chili.\n\nFortunately most people heal from this very quickly. I am one of the statistical percentage that didn't.",

I think that amount of nerve damage in the people that lost both was more severe and that is why it takes longer.   \n\nNerves grow back, but at a shockingly slow rate.

You said its not the mouth pain that gets you but bro yesterday ON MY MOMMA I was finna die from my mouth burning. My internal organs felt fine I think or maybe it was just so unbearably hot in my mouth that I disregarded the lesser pain. Anyhow drinking water/ soda/ carbonated water/ milk did shit... I saw some people snap their fingers to distract the pain, that was a no go... What did help was swooshing water in my mouth followed by placing an ice cube on my tongue and just letting it sit (repeatedly). So idk if its a per pepper basis but I most definitely nearly died from mouth pain",

If anything it should conclude that in lower scoville sauces the flavor as well as the capsaicin content plays a role in the perception of the spice but beyond a certain scoville rating taste becomes irrelevant to capsaicin burn perception.  \n\n(Keep in mind OP is eating reapers which aren't as hot as pepper X, which is the current hottest pepper in the world and is exclusively used in the last dab.  However both peppers are 2M+ scoville. Basically there's no evidence from the Twitter thread a 2M+ scoville experience is muted from covid)\n\nThe paper you linked is a hypothesis, not a replicatabe study, and theorizes that TRPV1 activation can help reduce morbidity in covid patients.  It's based on the low morbidity rate of Covid in India, where spicy foods are regularly eaten.  It never says people with covid become immune to capsaicin as the OP is claiming.",

                      "text": "That thread was written by a scientist btw. Yes, it's a case report with an N of 1, but the point of sharing that thread was to point out that OP isn't the only one claiming to have lost the ability to sense pungency. I've had a number of patients make the same anecdotal claim. It also appears to affect patients differently, which suggests that loss of chemesthesis induced by COVID may be variable. There is also evidence of inter-individual variability in pain perception induced by capsaicin ([Lotsch et al., 2015](https://journals.lww.com/pain/Fulltext/2015/03000/Pattern_of_neuropathic_pain_induced_by_topical.10.aspx)).  \n\nAnyway, it has been shown that calcium channel blockers inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, suggesting that COVID relies on calcium permeability to gain entry into host cells ([Straus, 2021](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.1c00023)). Calcium has also been shown to promote fusion of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV ([Lai et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283617304990); [Straus et al., 2020](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/JVI.00426-20)). TRP channels are also calcium ion channels and we know that COVID attacks tissues on which TRP channels are expressed ([Berlansky et al., 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8773957/)). It follows that TRPV1 expression may be downregulated as a result. Therefore, there may be a loss of chemesthesis leading to a reduced ability to sense pungency. In fact, [Parma et al. (2020)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7337664/) found a link between COVID infection and impaired chemesthesis in addition to smell and taste. Peppers on the far end of the Scoville scale have a greater concentration of capsaicinoid content, so these more pungent substances may overcome the downregulation of TRPV1 in some. Others like OP who may be unable to sense the pungency of reapers, for example, may also have inflammatory damage to the C and A-delta nerve fibers on which TRPV1 is expressed.",

                          "text": "I feel like it's being danced around that there is nothing definitive showing that capsaicin effects are completely negated by Covid as the OP claims.  Even within the explanation that TRPV1 expression may be downregulated, that doesn't mean the impacted person would be immune to the effects which is what OP is claiming.  They don't claim to have a diminished ability to detect the effects, but literal immunity to the impact.  \n\n>No taste, **no spice**. So I IMMEDIATELY threw two Carolina reaper peppers down followed by about 10-15 pieces of habaneros and death spiral peppers\n\nSo in that statement they claim to have absolutely NO ability to detect the capsaicin and claim to have eaten more than a dozen peppers with a good portion of them being over 1M scoville and the others being in the hundreds of thousands.  There are no accounts of that level of complete immunity to capsaicin in the studies you are linking.  I would be willing to accept that it could potentially have the ability under a certain scoville rating to impact your ability to detect capsaicin, but over a certain value (which appears to be in the hundreds of thousands at most) every example I can find including the tweet you linked acknowledges there is no relief from the burn because it is overwhelming and the reaction spans from areas well beyond those impacted by Covid.  Conjecturing that it *could* be possible for the OP while there is no credible scientific evidence to that effect, no case studies to that effect, and all available information claims it's at best a downregulation and not an immunity/inability to detect the effects is a reach imho.  \n\nThere is also the contradiction in the OP's own statement, claiming they had no effect from the heat but then also claiming their body reacted to the capsaicin. \n\n>my body started to retaliate. I was sweating. I was numb, I felt like I was going to die\n\n So the OP is claiming their receptors are working well enough to evoke a visceral response but somehow those same channels are not available to pass the signal to the brain from the heat of the pepper?  The much more likely scenario is that the OP is making this up.  I would have a much easier time believing OP is trying to fool other people into trying to eat absurdly hot peppers while they have Covid, similar to the hoax that saw people placing their iPhones into the microwave to \"wireless charge\" them.  \n\nAnecdotally, if you research the effects of these types of peppers on the human body you would see that somebody like the OP who normally doesn't ingest these peppers and has a low tolerance (which OP admits to in a comment where he says a bit of a carolina reaper in a pot of chili \"sent him over the edge\") would have catastrophic consequences from ingesting this volume of peppers in this short of a period of time.  It wouldn't just be indigestion and sweating.  Their body would be trying to evacuate itself in any way possible because the body treats this like a poison since the capsaicin tricks the body into having that type of reaction.  They would be puking, have diarrhea, severe stomach cramping, etc.  You can watch some of the impact on professional pepper eaters through the entertainment documentary \"We are the Champions\" and even at that level of tolerance those people throw up from eating multiple reapers in a single sitting.  These are people with an insanely high natural ability to withstand capsaicin, and they still have that kind of reaction to anything hotter than a scotch bonnet.  I find it basically impossible to believe OP would be telling the truth about the volume of the peppers they ate and the complete immunity to the effects when it comes to feeling the burn from them.\n\n\n\nEdit: If you want further evidence, OP is already starting to walk back their story\n \n*in relation to their claim to have eaten 15 habeneros*\n\n>[Oh not 15 full ones. I sliced two up into about 15 pieces. I don\u2019t want to think about what would have happened with that many.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/uyh8uc/tifu_by_eating_the_hottest_peppers_i_could_find/ia4e85r/)\n\nSo now it's already went from \"I ate 15\" to \"I ate 2\"",

I add several habaneros to my woks, chicken dishes etc. I was NOT prepared for how the stomach feels though. Mouth was stinging a bit, but very manageable, but stomach started hurting unlike ever before.\n\nThat doesn't really help the shit 12 hours later though, BUT what does help is a caloric deficit. If you keep your calories down, the pepper will stay inside of you longer and break down fully. You can eat mega spicy this way and barely feel a tickle when you shoot it out, but if you eat like an American and fat yourself up, it's gonna sting like a mf.",

The thing is, it never did.  I thought maybe it's just got traffic ahead and it'll come next time around, except it didn't and it hasn't.  And I'm pretty sure my butthole hasn't gone numb.\n\nSo made me wonder: can other foods neutralize the capsaicin while in the gut or if it just hangs out long enough it will be 'denatured' or just spread out amongst all the stuff to a point where it's not noticeable?  Typically hot foods help speed things up but hmm.",

Habanero is a whole different level. Even for people that can eat hotter things than habanero, they wouldn't deny that habanero is \"spicy\" (where you might physically not really be able to detect spiciness in sriracha). Habanero products (ie hot sauces) can also range depending on amount of habanero used. Personally, if you consider yourself to be a \"spicy food lover\", a habanero heat level would kind of be the minimum standard, and for people that don't have high tolerances and are trying to build their tolerance, habanero is around the level that people start having the goal of working toward. It's a great reasonable level to be at, whereas the things above habanero ,many people would seem to be unreasonable or too extreme. So like the dude in this post eating reapers - that's definitely on a very extreme level, and it is much hotter than a habanero, and involves indigestion, sweating, it's just a brutal thing.\n\nIf you are STARTING at habanero level already, and didn't have to \"work\" or intentionally build tolerance to get there, then imo you are a great candidate for learning to tolerate the highest levels of heat, such as what OP has posted. \n\nHere is a chart if you are interested in learning more!

Worst part was that it was aggrevating on top as soon I started to counter it with bread, a yoghurt or whatelse. Hell I even was so dumb to enjoy a beer to the 2 mil thing cause I easily handled all the other sauces. (EDIT: Strangely this sauce plus the beer also fucked over my tastebuds big times - took me a week or so to regain my normal sense of taste).\n\nBiggest FU on our side: We had our toddler with us doing the Gold Edition. Oh boy, we took turns on the playground afterwards moaning in pain and living through this questionable decision. \n\nBut hey! We are now immortalized with a photo on his wall.",

So while your digestive tract has fewer nerves that interact with your brain, it still has some. \n\nSpicy food is also kind of like alcohol in the sense that you have to know your limit (in terms of capsaicin; also known as scoville units)- and if you go over your limit you\u2019re gonna have a bad time later on.",

Particiants would sign a waiver, get a tiny glob on their tongue, and often puke and chug milk. Then they'd throw the videos on YouTube. On the way to the andouille festival south on I-10 I got the bright idea to try it. Indeed, it was a brutal experience for about 30 minutes, but I was proud of myself because I didn't vomit. Once the agony subsided we headed down the road to explore the local world of andouille. \n\nAbout 10 minutes out I was doubled over in agony and had to pull over to let the spouse drive. It came in waves of pain on-par with wisdom teeth extraction, but in the bowels, and about every 5 minutes. I was unable to stay for andouille and gumbo so we left to go home with me crumpled up in the back seat. \n\nIt took about 20mg of vicodin to get it under control, but I survived it. Oddly, I don't recall having anything unusual with the next BM or even the one after that, but I tell ya I've rarely experienced that kind of abdominal pain. Like someone was shooting me in the guts every 5-10 minutes with a Glock.",

      "text": "Here's some fun capsaicin facts and some biology facts both relevant and irrelevant to capsaicin.\n\nPeppers are \"hot\" because capsaicin is a \"poison\" specifically evolved to bind to specific receptors sensitive to physical heat, so your brain is being told that everything from the air to your saliva to any food or drinks you consume is practically lava. Otherwise, capsaicin isn't even acidic/basic and doesn't cause damage by itself, it's your body that, in some people, reacts to those misinterpretations of being burned. This is why flesh that isn't exposed to the air, like on your hands, doesn't burn when handling peppers since there is no physical heat to transfer through your protective outer skin to those receptors, but an open wound or your eyes will definitely burn when exposed to capsaicin. It's also why birds aren't affected by capsaicin, as there's nothing inherently physically harming them and their biology lacks the receptors the capsaicin was meant to activate.\n\n\"Taste bud\" is a term we use because the distinctive cells that react to molecules in their specific ways exist abundantly on the tongue, which of course is wired to your sense of taste, but those cells also exist in other parts of the body that react the exact same way to those molecules but aren't wired to your sense of taste, namely your stomach and rectum. This is why capsaicin produces warm sensations in the stomach and burns coming out the other end; for some people those warm sensations in the stomach signal the brain to induce vomiting when paired with enough stress hormone. In other words, not everyone will vomit when eating extremely hot peppers, and the people who are prone to won't react similarly when drinking warm fluids or eating physically hot foods because they aren't panicking and producing stress hormone like they do while experiencing the pain produced by peppers. This is also why peppers were thought to produce stomach ulcers for the longest time, and is still sometimes erroneously taught as such to  doctors today, when instead capsaicin actually aids in the healing of stomach ulcers (though, like most home remedies, these aren't claims supported by western medicine or entities like the US FDA) when consumed in smaller amounts that don't trigger stomach acid/bile responses in those people (which is what is actually producing and exacerbating the ulcers).\n\n(This is irrelevant to capsaicin but that \"taste bud\" cells exist in and are used in the stomach is believed to be why artificial sweeteners are not necessarily better alternatives for diabetics and other sugar sensitive people; although the sweeteners do not increase blood sugar levels that typically cause the detriment, the \"taste bud\" cells in the stomach react to the sweetness, triggering an insulin response that now has no actual sugar to bind to!)\n\nWhy then and for what purpose does the body produce these taste bud cells in the rectum? Well, for one, I don't actually know. But! Not everything that exists on or in your body has an important or beneficial function. Some things just exist where they do as a result of the growing process. The pathway from the mouth to the rectum is effectively a singular tunnel, and when you're an unformed embryo the same cells are initially involved in forming that tunnel before becoming specialized for their specific functions, so from beginning to end throughout that tunnel it is unsurprising that the same kind of specialized cells would exist even though as a fully formed organism the effective functions on either end couldn't be more different.\n\nLastly (and I guess this could be considered a very long **TL;DR**), here's some tips for eating spicy peppers. 1.) Drinking water will intensify the burn of spicy foods because the oils that carry the capsaicin do not mix with water, allowing those oils to reach your soft palate and other nooks and crannies in the mouth they otherwise wouldn't have reached. 2.) Eating spicy peppers with other oily foods will reduce the intensity of the burn and reduce how long you feel the burn as the oils that carry the capsaicin bind readily to other lipids, which reduces the amount of capsaicin available to bind to those temperature receptors in your mouth; try eating a spicy pepper sandwiched between two fried plain potato chips, the neutral flavor of the chips doesn't compromise the flavor of the pepper and you will find the burn to be dramatically more tolerable,  3.) While people swear up and down on vastly different ways to stop the burn of spicy peppers, in general after capsaicin is bound to those receptors there's nothing that will deactivate them except time. Those remedies aren't totally useless though as they distract you from the pain either (or both!) a.) physically by stimulating other nerves and receptors, effectively drowning out the false heat signals with other competing nerve signals firing simultaneously and/or b.) mentally by shifting your focus away from every second of the pain, usually by  focusing on the other flavors and textures involved in the remedy and actively focusing on comparing the pain levels before and after the remedy. Every second you spend distracted is one less second you spend totally immersed in pain.\n\nIf I think of something else later I'll add a 4th. Thanks for reading!",

Your cousine might be different form me so Iam not suggesting dishes but keep in mind that hot peppers or spice in general is not supposed to taste good on their own, like with any other food if you cook them appropriately or have them as sides(salsa or chutney) they make much more sense and actually enhance the taste.",

You aren't getting a cold again if you had it last week until a variant unknown to your body passes through and replicates before detection. I don't know why you continue to push a false narrative, Covid isn't some new intergalactic alien, and neither is the treatment being used in the vaccine. That being said, new data is replacing old and you're clinging to misinformation.\n\nAgain, you can't get the same variant of Covid twice. That much is obvious, as if proven by the fact that waves of Covid weren't reinfecting the care homes while the government was struggling to get them vaccinated. All the while none of them could be quarantined, locked in, or kept safe in any way. Dementia patients don't play ball, we can't keep a mask on them or lock them in their rooms. \n\nWhy is it so hard to look the facts in the face, there are thousands of care homes across the UK and the story is the same everywhere, nobody was ready and many died, but after the initial wave there was no reinfection. Those that survived Covid are still alive and still haven't gotten it again, even though Covid positive staff HAVE to interact with them due to staff shortages, and their care is absolutely most important.\n\nSo if you think that Covid doesn't have any problems with defeating the immune system over and over again and its always like your body doesn't recognise it, then explain the literally non existing reinfection. \n\nIf you're healthy and you had Covid even 8 months ago, you just wont get it again. You wont. And if you think you have it, it's not what you had before.",

              "text": "I'm sorry but that's not the case, it could be a different variant or the flu, since the flu also gives a positive test result with a covid test, and remember asymptomatic testing is only throwing a wrench in to the works since 97% of positives are false-positive on an asymptomatic result. It's a major reason why China is having so much trouble making a determination on Year 2 from their data, because they test everybody every at least every 2 weeks, my girlfriend even got a call from the governor himself after she forgot to test herself by day 13. But again, asymptomatic testing is shooting yourself in the foot, though I suppose they have to appear as if they're doing something while Covid still exists.",
