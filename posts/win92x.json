Eve, as the one who \"led Adam into sin,\" was afflicted with painful childbirth (Genesis 2:16-17). Women are \"saved through childbearing\" (1 Timothy 2:15) in the New Testament however. Since both of these examples cite men as being \"the head\" over women, it's easy to conclude that women must be married to a man as Eve was deceived first (1 Timothy 2:13-14). So a woman giving birth to children with a man who is her head/husband is acceptable and beautiful but a woman who is promiscuous is disgusting. \n\nHowever this isn't in line with Jesus' multiple declarations against judging your neighbor and being like the Pharisees.",

By that logic, any person who is the product of rape could be killed regardless of age, because its all the same as aborting a fetus (which they see as killing a baby).\n\nThis distinction is how we know all of the biggest voices are full of shit. They don't think a fetus is a baby. They don't think abortion is murder. Ask them some time if they know anyone who had an abortion--half of them have a friend or loved one who they say has had an abortion and that it's a mistake, but that they still love the person. Weigh that against how they would act if they found out their friend had murdered a baby with a knife or something. It's complete bullshit. They KNOW they're full of shit. They just want other people to suffer because they're personally ashamed about having sexual desire. It's fucking BONKERS",

              "text": "I think people actually have this one wrong, because it's counterintuitive.\n\nThe people who want to allow rape and incest exceptions are the ones who are demonstrating that they want abortion to be about not escaping a consequence of what they consider bad behavior. If you had dirty sinful sex, and you get pregnant, that's your punishment, and abortion is a way to get out of that punishment, so we have to ban it. That's how those people think.\n\nSo they also think that if you were raped, then it wasn't your fault you got an unwanted pregnancy, so you don't have to suffer the consequences - you get an exception under the rape clause.\n\nOn the other hand, people who oppose abortion because they genuinely believe it's the murder of a human being - and there are at least some of them - believe that it doesn't matter how the baby was conceived, that the life must be protected. Why should, in their view, a child be allowed to be killed because it was the result of rape? If you're protecting the kid, that doesn't matter.\n\nSo, obviously, it feels as though no rape/incest exception seems like a more extremist position, but I think we're actually making a mistake when we conclude that. Advocating a rape/incest exception means that the person is thinking about an unplanned pregnancy as a punishment for sinful behavior, not because they genuinely believe that the fetus is a human life that must be protected. \n\nAs counterintuitive as it may be, the people who do not want to allow the exception have a more consistent, more purely motivated position than those who want no exception. Even though the latter are taking the less \"extreme\" position, it demonstrates that their position is rooted in desire to punish/control rather than actually being \"pro-life\", and as such, it is actually less evil.",

The \"no rape/incest\" camp is more extreme because of what you just said: Protect the fetus at all cost. The mother can live with PTSD according to that camp but the fetus is what matters.\n\n2. That same camp has no comprehensive answers for what is to be done with the offspring. Most likely, the victim of incest/rape has to raise the child like [an 11 year old boy](https://cafemom.com/news/222229-marissa-mowry-ex-nanny-sentenced-abuse-boy) and a [13 year old boy](https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/18/babysitter-who-seduced-boy-13-baby-jailed-30-months-12723025/) had to. I use boys as the example because men can be raped and this is further evidence of the lack of comprehensive answers.\n\n3. There is no \"actually less evil\" when it comes to dictating how someone else should govern their reproductive abilities. That violates any implicit right of bodily autonomy.",

No one is expected to know everything there is to know about a prospective partner before going in to a relationship. \n\nNow, if he had kept seeing her after being made aware of what she allegedly was, that would be a legitimate concern.  As it stands, the intelligence community has said theres no evidence that he was the source of any leaks and he cut ties as soon as he was made aware of her possible motives.\n\nPerhaps of you explained just how you expected him or anyone else to avoid being in that situation, I would understand. \n\nAs is, it comes across as you just lobbing that muck at him and hoping it will eventually stick because you don't like the guy.",

If the opposing spy is that good and the friendly is truly unaware and didn't give up anything important, they aren't automatically going to lose their job. Spy agencies know this is a possibility, and they aren't going to burn otherwise good people for a mistake anyone could make, especially someone who isn't trained to spot a spy. If this were the case, government officials could only be in relationships with people of the same race and nationality, and that is too unrealistic of a requirement to enforce.\n\nIt's like an average person dating and marrying a well disciplined serial killer. Do you blame the person who had no idea what was going on behind their back? Are they dumb as a box of feathers for not knowing the person was a serial killer if they hid it so we'll? Everyone - and I mean everyone, including you and I - has been duped by other people. It doesn't make you dumb; it doesn't make you a risk. It just means you need to be more careful in the future, and in this specific case, you need to immediately be debriefed and tell the authorities absolutely everything you know and did.",

My only point of contention is the people claiming they'd never fall for a spy. If the spy is good at what they do, most people - especially anyone in this thread - isn't going to be figuring that out as quickly as they think they would. Look up the history of spycraft and see how many otherwise good spies were caught in honeypots and actually gave up sensitive information. At least Swawell didn't spill any beans and reported himself as soon as he found out. Many others ended up becoming double agents instead of admitting their mistake.\n\nIt's not just this scenario either. So many arm chair experts on Reddit think they'd never have the wool pulled over there eyes when it comes to anything. They're all experts on every subject, and have never been tricked or fooled or mislead.\n\nTL;DR: he's not dumb because he fell for something that many professional spies have also fallen far with worse consequences.",

On the flip side, Pete will not be president, IMO, because he is branded as \"can't draw Black votes\".\n\nFor Salwell, there was a viable path for him to make a name for himself as a Rep (like he is doing in this video). His campaign in 2020 branded him as too soft and green, and I don't really see how the campaign benefited his political future. Then again, what the hell do I know.\n\nI wish him all the best for 2024.",

What is incredibly common, is ripped flesh (or a nasty deep cut to avoid ripping) as a baby (much like a parasite!) doesn\u2019t care about the host\u2019s comfort as it exits the host body. Mothers have a higher risk of osteoporosis (brittle bones) as the baby takes the calcium it needs to form it\u2019s bones from the mother\u2019s bones. The growing foetus takes everything it needs from the mother\u2019s body and the food she eats. Cravings are common in pregnancy as the foetus tells the host body what it needs, which creates the craving. The foetus takes over inside the host body, rearranging the internal organs of the host during the later months to such an extent that it takes on average 5 years for the internal organs to return to their original places. That is, as long as the mother survives the process - not 100% guaranteed, especially in less medically advanced locations and in the past. \n\n\nSo yeah, while there have been very few, very rare cases of the foetus sending stem cells to treat an issue in the mother, but a baby is very much like a parasite which completely takes over the host body, takes everything it wants to the detriment of the host before it exits the host body in a drawn out, painful, gruesome way. Did you know that in pregnancy, the body had to release a hormone to stop the immune system attacking and killing the foetus as it is a foreign body and recognised as a threat by our immune systems? \n\n\nI write all this as a mother of two, very much wanted and very much loved children. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that a foetus is very much like a parasite! It\u2019s just one that we like, as opposed to tape worms, and the like.",

One wife dies in child birth you get a poorer, younger and more desperate in her place. \n\nWhen women are at risk of being prosecuted for crossing state lines to have an abortion, how easy do you think it would be to up and leave the state? That's the whole point of forcing birth: people stay poor for generations. It costs money to leave and a lot of times, some sort of job opportunity. For that you likely need access to a good education. Guess which states also rank poorly in education and teacher retention? \n\nBy forcing people to give birth we are forcing people into cycles of poverty. When we rank lowest in education, healthcare, and refuse to raise the minimum wage we KEEP people in cycles of poverty. \n\nAnd who'll work for cheap for generations to come and not put up a fuss not bc they don't want to but bc they lack support, resources, and basically have a boot on their neck? \n\nBut I digress...\n\nWho made these mo' fo's the coochie boss?",

It's completely unethical to value the fetus as equal to or more important than the mother.        \n\nAnd these are our *rights*, as soon as you let authoritarian regressives start taking a little they'll start trying to take the whole pie, and they might get it too because of general ambivalence.

It is stupid and doesn't make any sense. That is why we have speed limits and road rules that save our lives. We ban the specific thing we know is harmful, like driving on the opposite side of road.\n\nI understand that this entire law is nonsensical, and the goal is to just be dicks to women, because some people are apparently scared of em, but this is other take on the stupidity behind the law.

Like any other policy, to enact it you need political allies. Abortion is pretty well-supported in general. In order to restrict it, you need to appeal to religious extremists that *also* oppose contraceptives and sexual education. That is in fact what is happening on the ground now in the US. That is also what happened in Ireland and Romania.\n\n>I don't support contraceptive restrictions.\n\nTOO FUCKING BAD. **When you advocate and legislate against abortion, you *get* restrictions on contraceptives, too. That is the political bargain you make to effect the policy you desire.**",

I hear so many people mimic it, too (which is hilarious because thinking about it for even one second reveals how stupid it is). \n\nRow V Wade never said a woman HAD to get an abortion. It wasn't mandating anything other than saying the individual has the right to choose. I understand the thought of 'less federal mandates' (where the gov says this MUST happen) but all Row V Wade's precedent was saying was that it was a choice the individual had the right to make and the states ruling wouldn't affect that. \n\nSo getting rid of Row V Wade now makes it a state concern. Which, no matter what the state says is 100% a state mandate. They are either saying you can or cannot get an abortion. And some state governments will say you cannot get an abortion. Oh yeah so much freedom... \n\nIt should be up to the individual. My only thoughts now is that Row V Wade should have been done away with a long time ago so a new constitutional amendment could have been put in place. The right to abortion. Meaning it is completely your choice what you want to do with your pregnancy.",

Okay so how is it being up to the state any better? Row V Wade gave the individual the right to decide which is absolute freedom. Fuck the conservatives saying that this is about people having autonomy from the federal gov meanwhile the local gov gets to decide what they do with their bodies. It's LESS individual freedom. It's so contradictory to what they're saying this is about. The truth is they hate women and they want to control them.  \n\nI'm 100% on board with getting rid of Row V Wade if the right to abortion becomes a constitutional right and thus was up that individual. Any circumstance and for any reason that should be up to the mother of the child. That's it. Simple as that.",

Matters of health and public safety are reserved to the states; the federal government has no authority to regulate those things.  \n\n*Roe* was always a garbage decision based on hand waving and smoke screens.  It was just a matter of time until it was reversed and the power to regulate abortion was returned to the states, where it should have always remained.",

If I wanna turn into a fucking dolphin via plastic surgery and a surgeon is willing to do it that's my right. The state cannot mandate what I do or don't do medically. Plus again Row V Wade was a precedent for the 14th amendment that allowed one to choose. The federal gov never mandated anything. \n\n And why would you want it to? Jesus you guys couldn't handle the gov saying 'hey there's an epidemic it's a good idea to get a vaccine' My body my fucking rights... except when its someone elses body who you want to control. \n\nThere are some very niche exceptions to this but ultimately that argument is nonsense. \n\nYou're right for the wrong reasons that Row V Wade should have been overturned. It should have been overturned and became an amendment to protect personal freedoms so shit like this cannot happen and cannot disrupt millions of lives. I know you guys want to build a fascist state where the government controls everything that you do while you go 'tehehehe I hate public services and gov control'.",

Adding any types of exception doesn't change that the clinics themselves shut-down after the scotus ruling, and if you misinform people that the lack of exceptions is the issue, then they think the solution just becomes as simple as adding one or few lines.\n\nSo, I'm not defending putting a 10 year old at risk.

Yall will be back to religion one day, and then abortion will become fully illegal again. Rn, life is too hard and complicated so we allow sins everywhere as a lesser of two evils(or realistically lesser of two efforts). Probably in like 200 yrs tho things will be different and human life will be valued again.\n\nAnd ur Christ votes dem thing is such a fucking joke because u cannot be christian and pro-choice.

And two so that anti-abortion women would actually seek care so they wouldn't fucking die. \n\nNow anyone with eyes, ears, and three working brain cells would ask what the difference to rights is when removing a fetus from a fallopian tube vs a uterus...

I grew up very religious, so was automatically pro-life by osmosis. \n\nLaws specifically to punish women who have sex seem inherently barbaric and theocratic to most people. So they make it about the *baby*. If, in fact, a fetus is a baby deserving of the same rights as babies not in a womb, then the circumstances of conception *don\u2019t matter*. Do we treat people (who have already been born) like second class citizens because they\u2019re the product of rape or incest? Of course not. So, if a fetus is genuinely, truly a baby deserving of the same rights as everyone else, then there can\u2019t be exceptions for rape or incest. The thought of forcing a child to carry her uncle\u2019s child to term is so absolutely revolting to me, it flipped my pro-life all the way to pro-choice. Now, you can still think that exceptions are fine for rape/incest, but not for the consensual sex-havers. You have a right to an opinion, but you should at least be honest. It\u2019s not about the baby. It\u2019s about punishment. Or, at a minimum, some lives are inherently worth less because of how they were conceived. Which some people are fine with, but in a secular society, is a pretty unpalatable message for most people. And yeah, there\u2019s the whole \u201cthere are different kinds of killings in law, so why not with abortion?\u201d debate, which has some merit. But, by the same token, you\u2019re killing an innocent third party because of what someone did.

The law shouldn't make that decision for people. This is the so-called land of the free, after all. \n\nIf someone doesn't want an abortion, no one was forcing them to have one before, but now they're forcing others to not have abortions even if they would like to have one or actually need to have one, and that's not ok. It's control and it's evil.\n\nThe common argument I hear for this is \"I was forced to wear a mask for 2 years and then get a vaccine I didn't want to get. Why doesn't 'my body, my choice' apply to that?\" And the simple answer is: Because it's not just your body. And sure, you could make that argument with a fetus too, but it wouldn't be accurate. A living, breathing person is more alive than something that hasn't even developed enough yet to exist outside of its mother's womb yet! With covid, you'd get other people sick, with an abortion, the thing you're \"killing\" hasn't even been capable of hearing that word yet! Unless you're putting some weird things through headphones around the stomach, which I'd say would be fucking disgusting, but knowing these people, it honestly wouldn't surprise me! \n\n\"You know what we should have our unborn baby listen to through the womb?\" \n\n\"What?\" \n\n\"True crime podcasts!\" \n\n\"Hell yeah!\"\n\nLike, if they're really \"pro-life\" they wouldn't force living people to give up their lives or make their lives harder to have a chance of bringing a child into this world! That doesn't make sense! \n\nI and many others have said it multiple times before and I'll say it again: \"pro-lifers\" aren't pro-life, they're pro-suffering. They want to force women and even children to bring children into this life that, by the way, they haven't even made any safer for them, (All those shootings could probably have been minimized by now if only we had thought of some solution! Oh, wait, WE DID!!!), and then when those kids become old enough to bear children of their own (I would say \"when those kids grow up\", but we know that's not the case), they'll force them to do it too!\n\nIt's sick and I fucking hate all of these dumbasses who think this is in any way ok.",

An abortion is when the fetus is terminated before 20 weeks, this does not mean doctors removing the fetus which is a misnomer, the stories you hear about women going to the bathroom and they see the clump of cells taking the shape of the fetus fall out, that's by definition an abortion, other manners of the mothers body attacking or making the pre20 week gestation fetus nonviable is an abortion. A miscarriage is whenever the baby could have been viable from 20 weeks up to second stage of birth but due to varying circumstances, the baby did not survive. As much as this does confuse/infuriate patients and other people, in my medical classes i was instructed that I have to document the mother as having an abortion when the fetus was\"self terminated\"",

Many people think a D&C is something that is done only after a miscarriage, but that is incorrect.",

I put \"Doctor\" in scare quotes because he claimed that during the entire time he was an OB/GYN he never once, not one single time, ever saw a medically necessary abortion nor any pregnancy that threatened the life or health of the pregnant person.\n\nThis means that \"Doctor\" Ron Paul was either a) lying about being a doctor, or b) lying about never seeing a medically necessary abortion.\n\nRoughly 1 in 50 pregnancies is ectopic. The mortality rate for people suffering an ectopic pregnancy is about 99.999%. The mortality rate for a fetus that is ectopic is 100%. There has never, not one single time in all medical history, been an ectopic pregnancy that resulted in a live baby. And the number of people who have survived having an ectopic pregnancy is so tiny it's pretty close to zero.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is impossible for a person to graduate as an OB/GYN and be unaware of ectopic pregnancies. It's close enough to statistically impossible that during his claimed decades of practice that \"Doctor\" Ron Paul never once saw an ectopic pregnancy you might as well just say it's impossible. \n\nPresumably, like this person, \"Doctor\" Ron Paul is using an unspoken definition of abortion that does not include abortion for an ectopic pregnancy.  Or he's just a filthy fucking liar.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFun fact! Catholic dogma prohibits abortion in all cases and makes no exception for the life or health of the pregnant person.\n\nBut sometimes, if the administration isn't entirely evil, Catholic hospitals permit ectopic pregnancies to be terminated as long as its done in a surgically invasive manner that decreases the person's fertility and requires weeks of recovery afterward!\n\nHow?\n\nWell, per Catholic dogma God is really stupid. So they trick God using what they call the Doctrine of Double Effect. They say \"gee, this person's FALLOPIAN TUBE is really a problem to their health, see that God? It's the FALLOPIAN TUBE that's the problem. Totally not the fetus growing there. So we're going to remove the FALLOPIAN TUBE and, oopsie, that also just happened by pure coincidence to abort the fetus. But since we only intended to remove that pesky FALLOPIAN TUBE you can't say we performed an abortion, right God?\"\n\nAnd God, being very stupid, says \"dur, yeah that makes sense Mr. Dr. Priest Person! No abortion here! You get your extra special heaven pass!\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMind you, if the administrator of a Catholic hospital is feeling more evil they won't permit the Doctrine of Double Effect and instead will insist that a person suffering an ectopic pregnancy wait until their fallopian tube ruptures, causing internal bleeding, sepsis, and toxic shock, and then they will permit the doctors to attempt to save that person's life. Sometimes the doctors can't and the person with the ectopic pregnancy dies.",

As if I must have been trying to trick you about what you just wrote... when your words are right there on your screen and mine. Like there's no way I was in fact paraphrasing your ass-backwards moon logic, and when you called that a strawman, you were mistaken. \n\nAt this point you are quoting the dictionary definition of irony while ignoring how you've repeatedly done exactly what you're complaining about. Like there's no reason to ask about it, in a link to your own prior comments, where you prove yourself a hypocrite. (And in vain hope of preventing further moon-logic accusations, no, I'm not doing the same thing. We both know you're not quoting me directly. The issue is that you were completely wrong about what I meant.) \n\nAnd in all likelihood you're going to quote the first sentence of this reply, and then feign offense as though this length explanation doesn't exist, and I'm just dismissing you by declaring you incapable of argument. Like I haven't spent twenty-four hours patiently spoon-feeding you direct explanations of why I say the things I do. I can't even summarize that into an illustrative vignette because apparently you can't handle anything short of absolute literalism... from other people. You, the protagonist of reality, are doing something completely different. \n\nIf this isn't just trolling then you have my sincere pity. \n\nBut either way - you're demonstrating how someone capable of reasonable debate can utterly fail to have one.

You seem to think the previous sentence means I'm claiming to be a super genius. I have repeatedly explained what you're visibly fucking up, and you just loop right back to \"But why male models?\" \n\nAnd you still think ignoring my reasoning means there isn't any. No philosophical arguments about facades also being a performance we can judge. No highlighting how you are doing everything you claim I am wrong for doing. All you have to do is pretend the counterargument is \"trust me bro,\" and poof, there is no counterargument. \n\nYou are a perfect specimen. You have been wrong in every way it is possible to be wrong, on this topic, and you have zero self-awareness about it. \n\nBut if I don't have a simple plan that's guaranteed to unfuck your brain, I'm supposed to pretend you're right, and just keep arguing at you. Even though this whole stupid tangent began with you, quoting Sartre, saying that sometimes arguing with people is utterly fucking pointless, because they're only pretending to be reasonable. \n\nPass.",

You're reading every comment as an attack on you when that's not what's happening.\n\nSecond, no one thought you meant \"started slavery in the US\" because that's just as wrong and not what a figure of speech is. Also, when a conversation is about historical accuracy, don't exaggerate to the point of being wrong. \n\nThe Founders didn't start slavery. They didn't start it in the States either. It had been going on for centuries in the Colonies and simply continued when the Colonies became the States. \n\nWhat they did do is purposely ignore it in the Constitution in order to allow it to continue without fully endorsing it, setting the groundwork for it to grow. What (most of them) did do was own slaves, which is the most direct way of perpetuating slavery. Only a few were on the right side of the slavery issue, and even fewer still actually tried to do anything about it and even then only barely. \n\nYou can pick almost anything else about what most of the Founders did with regards to slavery and attack them on it, but in no way, no matter the amount of exaggeration, did they start slavery nor pass the 13th amendment as a way to perpetuate it. \n\nTo understand why we're taking issue with what you've said, imagine if you said \"Fuck Stalin for invading Ukraine.\" Someone obviously takes issue with this and tells you you're wrong and Stalin didn't invade Ukraine. You then say \"Well obviously I meant it's his fault because he started Russia invading countries and that's where Putin got the idea.\" So someone points out that Stalin didn't start Russian expansionist policies, that that's been going on for centuries, and blaming him for everything that came after is dumb and removes blame from Putin. \n\nNow, could you build an argument that Stalin's policies inspired Putin? Probably, but you'd need to bring supporting evidence and build an actual argument. Could you build an argument that the Founders' opinions on slavery inspired the men who passed the 13th amendment to enshrine slavery in the Constitution? Again, probably. But again, you'd need to bring evidence and construct an actual argument.",

They don't *like* that abortion is used to save women's lives, or to let children escape the horrifying results of being raped, so they INSIST it's just not *called* an abortion to make themselves feel better. \n\nBut when a doctor has a pregnant patient bleeding out on their table, with a miscarriage that's failing to psss and giving her a life-threatening infection, the doctor is going to look at the *MEDICAL DEFINITION* of the life saving treatment, see the term \"abortion\" and then look at the laws. If \"abortion\" with no exceptions are banned, this doctor would be *legally prevented from saving the dying woman's life.*\n\nSo pro life!!!! They don't care, they're not trying to make sure the laws include reasonable exceptions. They're encouraging politicians to make the most extreme pro life laws imaginable.",

This issue affects all of society for a number of reasons but whom it affects most is women and girls from poor communities and no matter the laws, the women at the top in high positions or being family members to people like some of these politicians, they will never lose access to medically safe abortions and they shouldn't. But some of them and their male family members are railing against abortion the loudest and they won't hesitate to quietly go to another state or even another country for an abortion while simultaneously blocking others. It's disgusting.\n\nI hate that poor folks are always getting caught up in the crossfire. I hate that they use issues like this as a distraction to cover even more despicable acts. I really hate people sometimes.",

They believe there is a god who loves babies and hates abortions. My point is simply that if there is such a god, the only evidence we have is the opposite: in fact, he loves abortions. That's the world we live in. \n\nIf you want to argue that God only aborts non-viable fetuses, fine: he loves making non-viable fetuses and then aborting those ones. If you want to argue abortions must be voluntary, I submit that everything is voluntary for a god - otherwise he would not be a god.",

One is a medical procedure to remove a non-viable fetus for maternal health. The other is the voluntary killing & removal of a viable infant. Sometimes it's done for maternal health, but generally it is not.\n\nLike I said, I'm completely pro-choice, but I also believe correct terminology & definition is imperative for understanding.\n\nNo one in their right mind would call the procedure a woman has to go through to remove her dead baby an abortion.

I absolutely do not identify as a mother and never will because I will never carry a pregnancy to term.\n\nAlso, calling pregnant people who are seeking abortion 'mothers' is language forced-birthers use for emotional reactions and as a way to guilt trip women and pregnant persons seeking abortion, by trying to force an emotional connection with the ZEF regardless of how they feel about it.\n\nSo please, let's not continue to use emotionally charged anti-choice language against pregnant people who are simply trying to make the right choice for themselves.",

And I will try to use pregnant person instead of mother more often but I think that\u2019s the exact same as the forced birth side telling us not to use abortion because that\u2019s not the same thing\u2026..\n\n[Medical Definition of Mother](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/mother)\n\u201cmoth\u00b7er (m\u016dth'er),\n1. The female parent.\n2. Any cell or other structure from which other similar bodies are formed.\u201d\n\nI get the first part, \u201cfemale parent\u201d can be an issue for many, but when we look at the second definition\u2026Biologically speaking, they are a mother.  This is exactly the same type of word play forced-birthers do ignoring the fact that medically speaking, an abortion is the same procedure no matter the intent.\n\nI don\u2019t feel like we can change scientific terms to justify one opinion and then turn around and refuse to do it for another.  \n\n I feel like you are picking and choosing what \u201cinflammatory\u201d language you choose\u2026since many would say abortion is inflammatory when describing a miscarriage. No. It\u2019s just the scientific word for it.\n\nGender aside, genetically the link will always be associated with the maternal genes.  Maternal genes get passed differently than paternal genes.\n\nYes, pregnant person can be used, but just as many people will be offended you didn\u2019t call them \u201cmother\u201d as those that would be if you did.  Which is why science terms are important.\n\nGender and sex are not the same. We have so many words that are gendered and scientific. Gender is a sociality construct. Sex is scientific.  \n\nThe problem is people don\u2019t want to accept that on both ends of the spectrum. Transphobia doesn\u2019t want to accept that gender is fluid and if people aren\u2019t the gender that matches their sex, so what?  \n\nSome trans activists don\u2019t want biology and science to say genetics and genes are male(XY)/female(XX) with a few exceptions of XXY and XYY. It\u2019s just scientific fact. Science cannot dictate your gender, it does however, say \u201cthese are your genes, no matter what they are and how you present on the gender spectrum\u201d\n\nThis reads like I\u2019m against trans rights, and that is as far from the truth as possible. But I am a scientist, and therefore tend to go with scientific terms that I am familiar with.",

I think it\u2019s ridiculous that we care who uses what bathroom based on what genitalia you were born with. I feel that the definition of a man and woman is vastly different than males and females. Some of this is science-based some of this is your opinion. But biologically speaking of acid already people either have XX chromosomes which are biologically female or XY which are biologically male. I don\u2019t feel that that makes a trans person any less man or woman depending on which way they\u2019ve transition. Because again\u2026 Gender is a societal construct of what a man and or woman is \u201csupposed to\u201c be like\n\nI am not trans so obviously I have the luxury of speaking on this without knowing it personally however I do have trans friends. I think the issue is so many people have such gender dysphoria about the idea of their DNA being XX or XY because people can\u2019t except the fact that gender is different and therefore are super trans phobic. So the people who are trans want to eradicate anything that can link them to the wrong gender that they are\u2026 But you can\u2019t change your DNA. If you find a way to change your sex chromosomes to XX from XY I will eat my words and serve humble pie\u2026. and maybe in the future will be able to do something like that but right now we can\u2019t inhumane. I think it\u2019s like saying you don\u2019t want to be a certain blood type. Although I will concede that there has been a rare instance where blood type has changed after a blood transfusion\u2026 But again see my last statement that as far as I know no one\u2018s been able to change their DNA from XX to XY or vice versa.\n\nHonestly I feel that trans people do a disservice to themselves with the conservatives if they refuse to accept that they are either biologically through DNA male or female rather than focusing on the gender issue.\n\n\nI have no idea whyso many people care what genitalia someone was born with. If they wanna live their lives as a woman or they wanna live their lives as a man who cares? It affects no one but them and any romantic partner that they choose to try to procreate with. It doesn\u2019t affect even affect romantic partners that they don\u2019t intend to procreate with if everyone is cool with what happens between the sheets\n\nEdit for typos..and I\u2019m sure I missed more",

One side is talking about the medical definition of abortion, the other side is talking about the moral side of abortion. Just like how one side talks about the biological side of sex and the other side talks about the cultural side of gender. Everyone is yelling, no one is listening.",

Because that\u2019s what it\u2019s is\u2026and that\u2019s what is on my medical chart.\n\nYou go ahead and ask your mom what they put on the chart for a miscarriage and if it\u2019s not spontaneous abortion, she\u2019s either lying, or is NOT a labor and delivery nurse.\n\nRead the dozens of response threads throughout my comment, including nurses and other medical people, who agree with me.\n\nPeople like you who refuse to accept facts and call it fear mongering drive me freaking crazy.

It's important to understand if they hold that same belief for 10 year old pregnancies not due to rape.\n\nIs it not an abortion if a 10 year old is pregnant due to rape, so we'll allow it, but an abortion if it was a consenting 10 year old, so she can get locked up?",

I have not been molested or sexually assaulted or anything like that but I had stirrings. I had seen sex on tv and was a little interested but not overly. At the age of ten (when puberty started for me) I got more curious. Took out some books from the library, did some learnin, asked a female friend if I could take a look. Bit of show and tell. If we had the time and place im sure we would have had sex. I ate her out. Admittedly it was because she asked what it tasted like and that was as far as it went because we were interrupted.  But long short, you can have those thoughts at an early age regardless of weather or not youve been diddled. Also later in life a friend of mines neice was being weird and doing inappropriate things at 6 years of age. I confronted her mother about it and the reasoning was they co-slept with her when she was smaller and had seen them having sex at some point. So regardless of what you think, people have that particular light turned on for them at different times or (like myself) pull the cord to illuminate on their own.",

Noteworthy that only one of the parties was brought up on the statutory rape charge here.\n\nSo nah, there are all sorts of exceptions so speaking in such an aloof and generalizing manner doesn't help the case here. \n\nAgain, for all we know she WAS considering that a pregnancy could be the result of a consenting child in whatever jurisdiction allows it. \n\nTo pretend that two children could have sex (consensual to each other, for whatever that's worth) and result in pregnancy and \"it is ALWAYS rape\" doesn't feel useful to me.

A sentence in the form of \"If A because of B\" can be understood either as implying that A can happen because of other things than B, *or also* as that B may cause A but not always.\n\nSo, looking at \"If a ten year old gets pregnant because of rape\", that statement can either imply that the ten year old can get pregnant from other things than rape, but it can also imply that a rape may not always cause a pregnancy.\n\nLike compare it to \"If a man dies because he was stabbed\". It can imply that a man can die from other causes than stabbing, but at the same time it can imply that a stab may not always kill someone.\n\nSo I don't think attacking that specific sentence structure is really warranted. *Especially* when you take into account the fact that she wasn't the one who came up with it. The guy was. He asked her directly if it would not be an abortion if a child got pregnant because of rape. She answered that if a child got pregnant because of rape, it would not be an abortion. \n\nShe is utterly full of shit, but lets at least have decent reading comprehension while talking shit about her.",

You can't believe in both the justice system and whatever criminals in prison deem right because those two exclude each other. If you believe that prisoners should put themselves above the law so you can feel good about yourself then say so instead of peddling this lie of believing in justice.

The fact that you think prisoners lynching each other is okay since they have to deal with the justice system after just makes this whole argument even more absurd.\n\nPunishment is a part of justice, not something separate. And the just punishment is the sentence invoked by the court, nothing more and nothing less. Anything else is not justice.

The argument goes that abortion is wrong because murder is wrong and abortion is murder because it's killing a person.\n\nThe trick being that the definition of murder is *wrongful* killing of a person, not just killing, so to prove abortion is murder you also have to prove it's wrong without relying on it being murder.

Young girls get sexualised from a young age, they get told over and over that once they have their period they're \"real women now\" and \"mature\" when in fact they're emotionally and physically not ready for pregnancy and motherhood at such a young age. \n\nAnti-abortion laws hurt **all** people who can get pregnant.

She did not agree to the story that was spread, but she wanted support from her parents and went along with it. \n\nThat was long ago, and they are fine now.

Unfortunately my degree wasn't \"useful\" or rare enough to secure me a job and work visa. \n\nI don't know about the UK specifically, but most countries require an employer sponsoring someone for a visa to prove they couldn't find a qualified applicant among actual citizens. If you have a degree and some experience in a profession that is more in demand, this requirement is usually waived, so you are given the work visa and ability to live in the country without having a job secured first. \n\nIf you're worried about the cost of education (and you should be) getting educated in Florida with a scholarship first is definitely a good plan. Though I'm not well versed on the specifics, *some* European countries (like Germany) do offer free tuition even for foreigners.",

Also, he said to go to the Captiol peacefully.\n\n>He built a wall that cost a lot of tax payer's money\n\nIf you read recent news, Biden is now going to finish the wall.\n\n> he is against abortion\n\nA lot of people are including me.

              "text": "That doesn't explain anything.\n\nYou have to ask yourself why so many Americans vote for a party that is not only openly against any progress but actively trying to take the country backwards. It's not like the Republican party hides it. They are publicly, loudly hateful of teachers and higher education. They want to defund education every chance they get. They are loudly against \"experts\" like doctors, scientists. They talk about how we need to cut taxes for rich people to \"create jobs.\" They hate government in healthcare. Are any of these secrets? Hell no. \n\nBut ~45% of the country votes for them every cycle like clockwork and thanks to our trash constitution that's enough to always be within spitting distance of the presidency and the senate which gives them plenty of opportunities to control the supreme court. \n\nWho votes for Republicans and why? Rank and file Republican voters don't actually like most Republican policies. Ask them about anything without attaching labels to them and they love it. They vote for Republicans because they're white and it's a white grievance party. Yes, some minorities vote Republican but it's simply not significant. Their support comes overwhelmingly from white people. \n\nIt's the Southern Strategy. Southern and rural whites have been voting their spiteful racial bigotry for generations. They started a civil war over it, the bloodiest war in American history. They lynched black folks, made them third class citizens, denied them any respect even as black folks fought and died for the country they all lived in together. They resisted even basic civil rights progress. When segregation was ended we needed to send in *soldiers* in many places to force southerners to abide by that new reality. White people did what they could anyway. They shut down public pools and public parks. Share with the coloreds? Hell no if we can't have it all to ourselves then we're going to make sure *no one* can enjoy it. Even abortion comes from this intense racism. Evangelicals didn't give a shit about abortion until they could no longer make an issue of segregation. They made a very intentional decision to pivot to abortion. One of the most successful third party presidential candidates of the modern era was an open segregationist named George Wallace who won 5 states, all in the South, running on \"segregation now, segregation forever.\" This is why they elected the most unqualified, unfit, inexperienced dipshit to ever run for the presidency in Donald Trump. The Republican party didn't force it on them, there were plenty of other candidates and it was clear the GOP leadership wanted *anyone* but Trump. Their voters picked him anyway. They didn't care about anything other than the fact that he was the most racist piece of shit to run in decades. \n\nThere's no getting around this fact. You can try to say it's about class all fucking day but that's not what's motivating voters to vote the way they do. It's racism. Do not confuse what you think it *should* be about with what it actually *is* about.",

Or even worse, some of these people think that 10 year old *should* be prosecuted for having an abortion done.\n\nThe worst part is, if you believe the former, then you're supporting the latter. Saying the Supreme Court decision doesn't mean people won't be prosecuted if they go to another state for an abortion is foolishness. The people that vote with that idea in mind are going to allow the people they voted for to do the very thing they said wouldn't happen.\n\nReligion is ruining this country. I always laugh when people ask why the younger generations aren't going to church. It's obvious the extremists are driving them away!\n\nJust to clarify, I'm not at all against religion, poor wording on my part. But the religious dogma that's allowing people to be so easily brainwashed has got to stop. Religion doesn't allow for independent thought, at least not the religion I grew up in. I'm sure most of them are the same, so I hope these un-taxed cults die off...",

It seems like religion is unfortunately mostly used as a weapon to justify evil behaviour by people in power, and its so easy to sing along to the tune and people just buy it in spades. (Long sentences sorry). But also an inability to see things beyond their face value is a huge issue as well, and then of course greed. But that's not anything new, I'm not massively well versed in the political world, but as an Aussie these are the things I've noticed in my own country as well, albeit no where near the same scale- *yet.* \nIt makes me so sad to see quality of living in the supposed beat times is so low, and nothing is being done about it. Feels like we've been pushed into this twisted and hate mongering system with the expectation that we should be grateful for it, just because we are forced to be at their mercy and we have a few malls and toys to buy to make sure we can feel like a good little boy. We honestly need to do a flat wipe, and start a new system literally from the ground up",

Other commonly-accepted reasons are preserving physical (72%) or mental health (69%), in cases of rape or incest (61%), and in cases of fetal impairment (61%). Performing an abortion because of economic or social reasons is accepted in 37% of countries.

Instead they have preconceived notions of what ideas or words mean and then twist their morals and actions around those preconceived ideas to fit their reality. \n\nExample (according to this republican\u2019s logic): abortions are bad, but I believe that forcing a ten year old being to have a baby is also bad. I cannot support bad things so therefore allowing the ten year old to terminate her pregnancy is NOT an \u201cabortion.\u201d \n\nAnother example: I got into an argument with my dad about Dr. Laura after I called her a homophobe. He said she\u2019s not a homophobe what do you mean. So I did one minute of research and found her homophobic statements, her apology for her homophobic statements, her using Yom Kippur to atone for her homophobic statements, and more. He said, yeah but that\u2019s not homophobia. \n\nHe already had a preconceived notion of what \u201chomophobia\u201d is and because Dr. Laura\u2019s behavior did not fit exactly into his idea, it isn\u2019t that. This is (one of the reasons) why people believe that racism is saying the n-word and nothing else. It\u2019s just plain arrogance and a lack of intellectual curiosity.

He must marry the young woman, for he has violated her. He can never divorce her as long as he lives.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's a pro-rape stance from the bible and nothing at all about a death penalty.

Believing other than they do doesn't make you different, it makes you *wrong*. \n\nExtrapolate that out, and it very quickly explains why they're willing to go to the absurd lengths seen here. The assumptions they base their life on wholeheartedly are as follows- \n\n1. The Bible is God's only word, wholly and completely infallible, and the lessons it teaches and directives it gives us are not up for debate or discussion.\n\n2. My pastor is God's appointed teacher for me on this earth, and what he preaches is divinely inspired by God to be what I need to hear and follow. Questioning him is questioning God.\n\n3. My pastor taught me that the Bible says abortion is absolutely murder in any circumstance. *(It doesn't, but they're pretty medieval about trusting the pastor and the passages he preaches from as he interprets then.)* \n\n4. Abortion is murder. This cannot be wrong, because if it is wrong then my pastor is wrong. He cannot be wrong because he was teaching from the Bible and the Bible is never wrong.\n\n5. If the Bible is wrong then *everything I believe is false, and everything I've done in my life since conversion has been for nothing.*\n\nPresented with an existential abyss of this magnitude, I'd suspect a lot of people would have a hard time. It's something very natural, very human. To realize that such a significant part of your self identity might not be what you believed, and at the same time to be faced then with the existential dread that comes with thinking about the afterlife, most evangelicals will resort to some pretty wild mental gymnastics to avoid *that* particular gut punch. \n\nAdd to that the fact that like 80% of their whole schtick is \"do you know where you'll go when you die?\", and you can see why tugging on any thread is so terrifying. Because as soon as you start to unravel the centuries of lies and bullshit, you're faced with the reminder that none of us knows what happens after we die and that's the big scary thing we all like to avoid thinking about. \n\nNot that any of this excuses her bullshit, because it doesn't. Anyone defending the idea that a 10 year old rape victim should be forced to carry the product of that rape to term is an utterly vile human being, and her acting like she wouldn't doesn't hide the fact that she very much would. I don't know her particular religious affiliation, but I grew up around evangelicals and I know *exactly* the line of thinking they would use to force a 10 year old rape victim to suffer through pregnancy and the trauma of child birth - \"god has a plan for everyone.\"\n\nIf you think that a 10 year old rape victim should be forced to have a baby resulting from that rape, you are a piece of garbage and are invited to fuck yourself with a rusty spoon. Full stop.",

Even with a really concerned effort by millions to convince everyone to do this, it still wouldnt be everyone.\n\nMore importantly, even if the first half of what you said DID occur, it's not going to change the minds of any of the GOP. If you have been paying attention, they do not change their stances just because they are given an ultimatum. In the unlikely event this occurs, it just means new job opportunities for heavily underqualified people. \"Oh you were a middle school nurse? And you are a Christian and believe abortion is wrong? You have now been promoted to head of surgery at X Hospital\". And while this is a ridiculous concept, it's only in response to that equally ridiculous proposal.\n\nNow before you get mad/downvotey/etc, Im not trying to be insulting. I actually like your idea in principle. I just know it wont work. There are only 2 ways that abortion will become nationally legal (or rather that anti-abortion will be nationally illegal):\n\n1. A minimum of 2 of the 6 right wing judges die during a Democrat presidency, and are replaced with 2 liberal judges, and then they are presented with an anti-abortion case and once again rule for the pro-abortion side and declare that women cannot be denied abortions  in any state.  This is the longer method.\n\n2. During upcoming elections in the next few years, there is a concentrated effort to remove current GOP members, especially ones in the Senate, and replace them with Democrats that will remove the filibuster, and then pass a national anti-abortion ban; one that overrides state law, and guarantees abortion to all women. This would also require you to keep the effort of voting up because if the GOP ever comes into power again they will overturn it. This is also the solution to a number of other bills and issues the the Democrats want to pass, is the quicker option, and probably the easiest one to achieve.\n\nI dont hate your out of the box thinking, I just know that the GOP has learned that they dont need to play by the rules because for the most part there is no authority higher than them and they dont have to answer to anyone. They have shown that they would rather let the building burn to the ground while inside of it than put it out with liberal water. There used to be a level of compromise, but the age of social media has killed that and everyone now just takes a hard stance on everything.",

Any time fetal tissue is removed from a person, whether it's an ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage, nonviable pregnancy, or elective termination it's going to be coded as an abortion. Anytime we make abortion dependent on a legal proceeding, like for a rape, any doctor or patient who doesn't wait for the trial, runs the risk if being in violation of anti abortion laws.\n\nThe actual legal and medical landscape doesn't reflect the magical fairytale that anti-choice folks created to feel better about the harm these laws can cause.",

There are different shades of grey that result when black and white lines of society meld which require specific solutions to problems that don't fit the mold. Exceptional cases require exceptions and even though I feel that the sanctity of life should be respected, there should be clauses in abortion laws that allow victims of rape to decide whether or not they want to bear the child as it was developed not of their own volition but against their will and is a stigmatic reminder of the trauma and scars they have to bear. In these cases, the child would be the subject of scorn from the mother as they would represent the shame, weakness, and trauma of that harrowing moment, not recieving the love and care that each child deserves. The father would be selfish and uncaring and the child would be an insult to the family forced to support their development and carry on the progeny of the criminal. The aim of laws is to carry out justice and to protect the rights of people so they can live with dignity. There is no dignity in forcing people to carry a stigma that was of no fault of their own but more of an undeserved and misplaced punishment.",

In addition, if the states keep these unfair and biased laws against females they should, in fairness, also pass laws against men that have indiscriminate sex as they are the true problem.

And also so that people stop complaining about minimum wage because there will be more than enough people with no choices willing to work for barely anything? I just find it hard to believe that 'concern for unborn foetuses' is the reason why they're doing this. We don't live in utopia- there are a lot more pressing issues to tackle yet they've decided to waste time on this meaning there's probably another agenda. Crime rates will rise though because of this.  \nIdk just random thoughts.",

The whole focus is on quantity of life and none on quality of life. It's cruel to force someone to carry out a pregnancy they don't want to carry. It's cruel to make a 10 year old run to other states in shame so she can 'murder a child'. Its cruel to kill women over unborn children. And most of all, it's cruel to make a child be born in the worst of conditions and then forget all about it. And society does forget about them whether you agree with it or not. And to answer your question yes, i would still support abortion, just like you are still pro-life despite women literally dying because of non-viable pregnancies even though it's completely preventable.

And another thing, medical abortions have been a thing since the 1800s but prostitution is considered one of the oldest professions so all 'banning abortions' is going to do is increase the casualties.

Really racking up an All-Star line-up.\n \n  I'm not saying I support that. About 75% of US citizens support abortion in some form and none of those exclude when a raped child becomes pregnant. What I don't support is attacking people of religion because these republican trolls popped their heads up and used religion as a scapegoat. TBH, these people are still mad women and minorities have a right to vote and they played the system to attack an issue Democrats care about. Abortion is a gray area in every faith, some are more accepting of it. Even in Catholicism until 1917 abortion was \"permitted\" until quickening, or when the mother can feel the baby move because that was when they believed a soul entered the child.",

Gay people were in the closet for thousands of years in some places, and that did nothing to stop the stigmatization of homosexuality. It wasn't until they had the opportunity to march and be out in the open that people began to accept them more. Like it or not, those gay parades that you probably feel are \"pushing their sexuality on me\" have served and still serve an important function.\n\nThe fear of the \"stranger\" is the root cause of hating those that are different from us. The fear that comes from not knowing exactly what another person is thinking, which is amplified in the presence of those who look different, or come from different cultures/religions. You can probably guess that it is also deeply related to our fear of death, making it even harder to overcome.\n\nExposure to those that are different, finding common cause with them, becoming friends, becoming familar with their customs, their languages, etc is the best possible way to stop that.",

It\u2019s when any said religion pushes a self-righteous and dogmatic agenda, THEN there becomes a problem.\n\n(So far)\u2026 YOU get to choose/can choose YOUR religion. So why is it that once YOU make YOUR choice about what religion is right for YOU, do YOU start imposing it on OTHERS? THAT\u2019s when it all starts to go downhill.\n\n- - - - - \nAmendment due to \u201cyou can\u2019t choose your religion\u201d comments: Yes. I feel I chose my religion. My immediate family was basically nondenominational when I was a small child. Not atheists but seldom if ever spoke of anything religious. I occasionally went to my grandparents church (father\u2019s side/Southern Baptist) when visiting them, as well as occasionally attending my mother\u2019s parents church (Methodist) when visiting that side of my family. Segregation started up when I was in my very early teens and there were terrible upheavals in my city. My parents decided that they wanted my brother and I to attend private school and that meant becoming Catholic. We went through all of the pomp and circumstance of making that happen and so I finished high school. In college I attended a Unitarian church nearby, more out of curiosity than anything else. That didn\u2019t click so I started studying Buddhism. I actually found that to be the most grounding and logical and stuck with that for many years. Dropped that because of (surprise) in-fighting amongst the members of the Sangha. Currently (on paper and if a hospital should ask me), I put down Catholic, BUT I disagree with nearly everything that the church stands for, esp now. I would classify myself as \u201cspiritual\u201d and I don\u2019t rule out anyone else\u2019s \u201cbeliefs\u201d. Why? Because they are just that \u201cbeliefs\u201d. I DO NOT think abortion is a first line solution, I DO NOT believe anyone has the right to kill another individual, but I DO NOT feel that you can impose your will on to others. Every one of us has this life right now. Who knows what happens after. (I believe we will ALL find out) \ud83d\ude09 But to say you can\u2019t choose your religion holds NO water with me. You have a free will. People change their beliefs and faith all the time. Hell\u2026 I\u2019m still shopping. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

This is a reasonable assumption, in my opinion\u2014the law has widely been interpreted by doctors to mean that pregnancies can\u2019t be terminated until the mother\u2019s vital signs start to fail. \n\nAt that point, whether they asked for one for her and were denied or went out of state because they didn\u2019t think they could get one and were probably correct is a distinction without a difference. In constitutional law, this is called a \u201cchilling effect\u201d\u2014if the law is so vague that people restrict their actions because they\u2019re reasonably afraid of falling afoul of the law, even if the law was written to allow those actions, it\u2019s still restrictive. It\u2019s not a 1:1 comparison because abortion is no longer considered a right protected by the constitution\u2014but to me it\u2019s a helpful way of framing the importance of how the law will be read and interpreted by people. If no doctors will offer abortions in this case because of the law, the law restricts abortions in this case even if you could argue that it doesn\u2019t.\n\nIn conclusion, fuck this law and fuck anyone who was involved in getting it instituted.",

This means that some dude comes and says \"I want to gift this dude my house and he will gift me his company\" and you don't say stuff like \"You must be an idiot. That's a textbook barter contract and you should know better\" and instead you say \"Of course, that can be done but keep in mind the law requires you to pay barter taxes in this kind of cases\".\n\nThe woman is actually right. You can have exceptions in law, and being real, most laws are just giant exception packages.\n\nYou can't steal. But it's not considered stealing if you need the item in a store to survive and you pay back for the item and all damages done to obtain it later (as an example).\n\nStatistically, disregarding your position on the matter, only about 1 in 100,000 cases of abortion are a result of rape (as per 2012 statistics, I haven't checked in a while) so it's just as invalid to say abortions should be allowed because of that just as saying that murder should be allowed because murderous self-defense is actually murder (and in that case we just make self-defense not be considered murder).\n\nEvery single person I have asked is ok with abortions when you're raped. Or if they're not, they quickly change their mind when you ask them if they would do it if it happened to their sister/wife/mother etc. so that should be a legal exception as literally nobody is really against it.",

This makes it so doctors just won\u2019t perform the abortion for fear of losing their license. So now, regardless of exceptions, abortions are less possible.\n\nEssentially, you have to go on trial before you can get an abortion. If a doctor performs an abortion, they have to break the law, put their license on the line, and essentially ask the forgiveness of the court.\n\nSo, no, the exception isn\u2019t really an exception at all.",

Regardless of the mental and emotional trauma of reporting assault, it is always going to be on the the person receiving the report to determine if it was in fact rape. If a woman is raped by her partner, how does she prove that to the officer taking the report? Enough to get the report. To get the abortion. What if it was coercive rape. Not all rape is violent. What if she had consensual sex but he didn\u2019t pull out like they talked about.  Or the condom broke. Or he didn\u2019t wear a condom like he said he would. What if he told he had had a vasectomy but hadn\u2019t. These are all examples of rape that likely would be questioned upon reporting. In an ideal world your plan would work.

Congress tells judges what is and what is not allowed.

Anything beyond this matter seems extremely subjective and beyond objective reasoning.\n\nI simply do not understand why we are not treating this as the people of each of our states in the US, deciding to legalize 'medically necessitated abortions' vs 'elective abortions'. Tbh I do no see any reason for not allowing 'medically necessitated abortions', however, more reasonable, and unreasonable I'm certain, debates are sure to follow.\n\nWhat we are talking about,no matter how you slice it (no pun intended), is the 'freedom of choice in how a woman chooses to manage their body' versus the 'destruction of an organism in the early stages developing into sentient life'. \n\nAs a sentient species we need to begin asking ourselves these tough questions without fear of reproach, from the most intellectual, most empathetic,  most moralistic, to the least intellectual, least empathetic, least moralistic if us all ; such as how productive are we to limit how a woman conducts their choices and yet whom are we to determine the destruction of any sentient-bound lifeforms.\n\nTime to prepare for a paradigm shift in societal mores and norms on a global scale people.",

No doctor can say with certainty at 6 weeks that a pregnancy is going to put even a 10 year at danger of dying. They would have to wait and see how the pregnancy develops before such a determination could be made with certainty.  And therefore no doctor is going to be willing to risk criminal charges for performing an abortion which the pro-life extremists who are clearly in charge of the Ohio state government might determine was not justified.\n\nHere is the specific quote from the law for the only allowable exception to the abortion ban in question:\n\n>A physician who performs a medical procedure as described in this division shall declare, in a written document, that the medical procedure is necessary, to the best of the physician's reasonable medical judgment, to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or to prevent a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman.\n\nNo doctor can know with certainty that an abortion is necessary, even for a 10 year old, \"to prevent the death of the pregnant woman or to prevent a serious risk of the substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman\" at 6 weeks.

So functionally the law as written prevented any doctors from being willing to perform an abortion simply based on the fact that her being 10 increased the risk above the normal level for all pregnant women.  No doctor is going to perform an abortion on the hope that lawsuits would rule in their favor to keep them out of jail.\n\nIf amendments are made to the law to clear this issue up, fine, you will then have a point.

It needs to be *legally* a danger to the mother's health.\n\n*Technically* thousands of girls age 10-14 give birth *in the US* every year. And even more worldwide. And *most* of them don't die.\n\nIn fact, the legal explainer by the AG that **you provided** states that it must be a \"*medical emergency*\" that necessitates the \"*immediate performance*\" of an abortion. Since the girl was still in the early stages of pregnancy, the abortion was technically *not* an emergency and did not necessitate the *immediate* performance of an abortion. She could have gone several months before the pregnancy began to affect her health. Therefore, according to the explainer by the AG that you linked, the 10 year old's abortion does *not* fall under a legal abortion and any medical professional in Ohio who performed it would be risking their license and their freedom\n\nIt doesn't matter if a majority of doctors would not support this child carrying a pregnancy because we're not talking about medicine or morals. We're talking about the problems with the law, and according to the law, the abortion would not necessarily be legal until the moment it was an **immediate** threat to the girl's health\n\n*You* stated \"the mother lied that the child\u2019s abortion went against state law\". You are wrong, according to your own source",

This case should never be used for the abortion debate for multiple reasons. \n\n1) The doctor who performed this procedure broke HIPPAA reporting on it for the Pro-Choice argument and immediately clammed up because she knew she broke laws doing so as the story took off and actual investigative reporting started.\n\n2) The mother lied about multiple factors to multiple STATE MANDATED reporters. This made the investigation necessary and makes corroborating the mother\u2019s story hard.\n\n3) The information prior to the actual abortion is limited as the mother was trying to hide this event and the event was only revealed by the doctor using it for a political tool. Everything else has been an issue for investigators.\n\n4) The abortion actually happened out of state. This negates a lot of the argument. The actual attempt for the abortion in state has zero evidence as the mother\u2019s effort to cover up everything has muddied the waters. This fight is a hypothetical study because by the time this case WAS known, the abortion was already performed and the actual effort made for an abortion in Ohio was clearly minimal. This case was never reviewed for qualification by the actual law\u2019s process. \n\nThus this case should only be an example of piss poor parenting. Honestly, I do not even care that the man who did it was an illegal. I care that the mother wanted to protect the scum who raped her daughter because he was the mother\u2019s boyfriend.",

The fact is that the way the law is written makes it risky for doctors to perform the procedure at all and could force people to travel out of state. It doesn't negate the argument, it is the argument.\n\nThe **fact** is that you claimed that the Ohio law would allow this abortion, but the way the law is written it *would not*. That's the problem. It is specifically written such that the doctor must provide a medically diagnosed condition that necessitated an immediate abortion. And several Ohio doctors have confirmed that based on how the law is written, they would *not* have performed the abortion and would have recommended that she go out of state\n\nAlso you're being a hypocrite, because you keep talking about HIPAA being violated, but then you demand evidence that the girl's abortion was denied in Ohio. We do not need this information in order for this case to draw attention to the problems at hand.\n\nWe do NOT NEED a perfect victim to start the discussion \n\nYou're getting caught up in trying to probe this family in order to poke holes in the story and missing the entire fucking point.",

People do not feel the sympathy when you talk about a woman who is well into her adulthood, gets accidentally pregnant, and WANTS an abortion because she does not want the kid. What are the THREE outliers that are ALWAYS used by the Pro-Choice extremists? Medical emergency, incest, and RAPE. This case had the rape of a child which truly manipulated the emotions. Except by statistics rape and incest make up less than 1% of all abortions and medical necessity makes up around 15%, which means the majority of abortion is about convenience, which is not as emotionally motivating. The only reason you would include THIS case is if you need the emotional manipulation, which is why the Indianapolis doctor even leaked this story. \n\nDisregarding the lying mother means we have almost no information on what the mother actually did between finding out her daughter was pregnant by her boyfriend and getting rid of the evidence of her boyfriend raping her daughter. You seem to think this does not matter but it does. Why do you want to make a case with a woman who lies at the core of abortion? You should want women who are GOOD examples! You should want ACTUALLY sympathetic women. This case is disgusting and it makes anyone who abuses it look disingenuous and immoral.\n\nThe abortion law that restricts abortion was never tested, so by getting the abortion in Indianapolis and blaming Ohio, the abortion was never DENIED and the abortion happened. By never pushing for the abortion to happen in Ohio the whole argument is a hypothetical because the law was never tested. This is exactly why all the Pro-Choice extremists are screaming \u201cthe Ohio law doesn\u2019t work\u201d and why all the Pro-Life extremists are screaming \u201cThe law works\u201d because in the truth this case is hypothetical. The girl\u2019s pregnancy was never presented to the Ohio doctors to approve or disapprove so the law was never tried in this case. The abortion was done in another state with it never pushed for in Ohio. \n\nThe fact you say you want a perfect \u201cvictim\u201d is fucking sick. Most abortions are because a woman accidentally got pregnant. You make it sound like you need a rape victim, an incest victim, or a victim of medical emergency. If you want to make a case for abortion, make a case for the AVERAGE abortion because a LOT of abortion restrictions do not apply to rape, incest, or medical emergency. You want victims to be abortion exemplars but the truth is you need to stop parading VICTIMS and start showing that abortion is not JUST for victims!",

The majority of women who get abortions are NOT VICTIMS. Stop using victims for emotional manipulation. I used the word EXAMPLE for a DEBATE. You want victims. You say it multiple times\n\nlol I literally never said that the majority of women who get abortions are victims OR that we need a victim at all for this discussion. I think you need to work on your reading comprehension because you are *absolutely failing* to read my comment correctly. Multiple times now you've claimed I said something that I didn't. Stop arguing against a straw man\n\nNot all women who *get* abortions are victims, but victims ARE ALSO VALID recipients of abortions and it **is important** to discuss how anti-abortion laws affect victims\n\nAdditionally, all women who want an abortion and are forced to carry the baby to term or are otherwise *harmed* by this law **are victims [by definition ](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/victim)**. The definition of victim does not require a crime, only that someone is harmed by an action, and forcing someone to carry a baby to term *is harm*. So even if we were discussing an adult woman who willingly had sex and was unable to get an abortion due to this law, *we would be talking about a victim of this law* because she was *subjected to oppression, hardship, or mistreatment*.\n\nThe entire **point** is to discuss the issues with this law, which means we are talking about **the people that are subjected to harm due to this law**, who *literally by definition* are victims. You are the one who is apparently only willing to discuss the \"perfect\" one with no complications, and I am saying that every one (including this one) is valid\n\n> If you cannot make an argument for abortion with average women, the majority of people who actually get abortions, and have to use women who are VICTIMS of outlier events, then you are using victims and their experience for a debate argument. That is emotional manipulation. \n\nThis is ridiculous. You're saying that if a law does not account for outliers, we just can't talk about it? That's nonsensical. It would be fucking absurd to apply that logic to literally any other law, and it's fucking absurd now\n\nThe law, as written, does not account for people like this girl, and that's a PROBLEM that we need to *talk about*. You are just obstructing for absolutely no reason.\n\nEven for people who support an anti-abortion law, most do NOT support a law written as this one is. And that is a reason to discuss these outliers. Even *beyond* the debate of banning other abortions, we *also* need to make sure that *other* people who have exceptional situations (\"outliers\") are not harmed in the process.\n\n> This child is an example of why the CPS system needs an overhaul. That mother should be in jail with her pedo boyfriend and never allowed to see any of her children again.\n\nAnd it is ALSO an example of how poorly the Ohio abortion law is written and the harm it causes which is what we're talking about right now.  \n\nPlease explain how any of that is relevant to whether or not the law should explicitly allow her to get an abortion. Focus for two seconds on the person who was actually pregnant and not the people around her.",

I know you want so desperately for the \u201cbad guy\u201d to be the state and the laws, but you are willfully ignoring the facts. This child is the victim of a disgusting man who forced his penis into her ten year old vagina. This child is the victim of a neglectful and abusive mother who allowed her boyfriend to shove his penis in her ten year daughter. This child is the victim of a doctor who did not FIRST alert authorities immediately to the sexual abuse but instead wanted to make a Pro-Choice shocking argument to laws she personally disagreed with. \n\nI don\u2019t like to insult people or use harsh language because it gets us nowhere but I am going to need to end that. I have to question how do you confuse LYING  about the mother\u2019s GROWN BOYFRIEND shoving his fucking dick INTO a ten year old with a MISTAKE? That fucking woman let a grown man FUCK her daughter and LIED to PROTECT the fucking pedophile. Please do me a favor and you tell me how that is a FUCKING MISTAKE?! That woman is a MONSTER second only to that FUCKING PEDOPHILE! How DARE you try to excuse her LIES for a FUCKING MISTAKE!!!! You sound like a fucking pedophile defender! \n\nI never fucking said that child\u2019s case wasn\u2019t fucking legal you asshole. I said her case is not good for pointing out flaws for the Ohio abortion law. Her case IS VALID for why abortion SHOULD NOT BE BANNED. It is NOT A FUCKING REASON AGAINST THE OHIO LAW! I know I was polite before but you seem fucking insistent to ignore the facts. That fucking bitch LIED to protect the bastard who FUCKED HER CHILD!!! You seem to think the mother was some innocent angel who made sure her daughter aborted a pregnancy that was dangerous for her because she was worried about her daughter\u2019s health. She didn\u2019t fucking care about her fucking daughter! She cared about protecting her fucking pedophile boyfriend!!! Do you trust she pushed for her ten year old to get the abortion IN HER STATE? Are you stupid? That lying bitch went to the next fucking state because she NEEDED that child to get an abortion so her boyfriend wouldn\u2019t get caught for FUCKING SAID CHILD! She knew she would have to face the Ohio board of review, she needed that abortion fast and ran to the next state to get it. It also shakes the CPS report.  \n\nThen you, you disgusting pedophile ignoring PRICK, say that I am asking for victims. I never said that you asshole. \n\nTLDR: This child was a victim to her mother\u2019s pedophile boyfriend and her mother got the abortion out of state to help hide the rape of her own daughter by the mother\u2019s own boyfriend. The child represents why abortion should not be banned and how they can be medically necessary but never challenged the Ohio law because the mother ran across state lines to hide the sexual abuse of her own child by her own boyfriend.",

Who do you think SUGGESTED those restrictions?! \ud83d\ude02 Thank you for thinking I am so intelligent I would worry about doctor certifications and hospitals for emergency response. There are doctors who are arguing that abortions should only be completed by doctors and in hospitals and some are concerned about emergency situations and others are concerned about quality of care and others are concerned about expertise. Oh, and not all doctors are in agreement for these issues. I formed my opinions based on the doctors worried about safety. I agree with their arguments. If you are okay with a Nurse practitioner dilating your cervix and jamming utensils into your uterus to disarticulate a third trimester fetus risking uterine scarring and potential infection or sterilization that is on you. But when I vote, I am voting for safety for people who might be as ignorant as you are about the medical concerns.

It would be like if I got a speeding ticket and I argued that the appeal process was corrupt and unfair when I just paid the fine. If I never made an appeal, I cannot argue the process is bad. You want this case to prove the law is bad, this case never tested the process the law made. So you are Pro-Abortion because Pro-Choice people want examples that PROVE that the law is bad, which means the process the law makes needs to be enacted for the process to be challenged. I truly believe this law will be changed. One of the first things should be the date when an abortion is allowed. Because even if you claim there are no providers abortion is still legal for six weeks of pregnancy. Six weeks is super early and many women do not know they are pregnant at six weeks unless they are vigilant or very regular. Once enough women need to make appeals and the data shows it OR the population of Ohio votes, this will change. I note you never did answer me if you live in Ohio, I assume you skipped that part of my response. \n\nI also love how you changed your response from \u201cmedical professionals\u201d to  \u201cmedical groups and licensing boards.\u201d You think by changing your wording you can cover up that you are wrong. You actually think the doctors I listen to are random nut jobs and not groups. There are many doctors who do support regulating abortion and many are parts of medical groups and licensing boards. Oh, and a bigger point, these are PRO-CHOICE DOCTORS! How are you going to perform YOUR gymnastics around that fact? You keep claiming regulations are bad and that abortion clinics are safe, but you are making that up. You don\u2019t care about learning about any of these regulations or why they are being recommended and you have no idea about the quality of all abortion clinics around this country. Abortion does have a mortality rate, thankfully it is fairly low, abortion does have a complication rate, and while it is low, it is nowhere near as low as the mortality rate. The recommendations of these doctors is to just not have abortions in clinics which will not have the equipment necessary for emergencies, for example, blood transfusions. Clinics only have specific materials and that means that if an emergency arises they literally have to call an ambulance to take patients to the nearest hospital. And no, the answer to this is not to put things like blood transfusions INTO clinics, it is to perform abortions in hospitals where if an emergency happens the patient is run down a hall to the ER instead of waiting for an ambulance, travel, and then to the ER. You seem to think these regulations will make GETTING an abortion HARDER, and you have no idea it is to make getting an abortion SAFER.",

The worst part is you are dying to disclaim my points by your own poor reading of what you bothered to read. \n\nI mentioned that some doctors want abortions limited to professionals, those professionals range based on the group of doctors from doctors only, which I prefer, to midwifes and other OBGYB certifications which are not doctors. You however act like I said \u201cDoctors ONLY recommend doctors perform abortion.\u201d I said \u201csome doctors recommend.\u201d YOU keep trying to twist my words but I refuse to let you. Check some of the regulations. The WHO has standards for who should perform abortions, classifications for types of abortions, equipment that should be in separate abortion clinics. Not every doctor agrees but YOU claim that people should let professionals make the decisions. The professionals are NOT in AGREEMENT. I listen to the more safety concerned professionals but you accuse them of DENYING. You are not a reliable source because your statements are in absolutes and broad strokes when you clearly hav no idea to the plethora of opinions that fall into the Pro-Choice label. But you are more than willing to call anyone who does not hold your reckless dedication to \u201cabortions at anytime without any regulation\u201d as not Pro-Choice.",

I have told you numerous times I think the Ohio bill is not perfect and I do think voting will get it changed. Also, you want to ignore it, but a large portion of Pro-Choice people do agree with certain restrictions because of the MEDICAL advice from doctors. Example, abortions of convenience should be done prior to 20 weeks.",

I have a problem with THIS SPECIFIC case being used in any abortion argument. This case was a narrative from the moment the mother took the daughter across state lines. That woman made up a story and it was made into a narrative for the anti any regulation Pro-Choice, because the truth is, many people who are Pro-Choice support various forms of regulations. Be it doctors being the only ones to perform abortions, abortions needed to be performed at locations where emergencies can be handled, etc. My issue is using this case where the mother is a criminal and most of this case was a lie. As for this clip, my issue is that an abortion is the termination of a pregnancy, the woman who says it was not an abortion is just wrong.",

But that is because I am a high science person and with modern technology and medicine, abortion seems like an unnecessary savagery that should only be necessary when shit hits the fan. Ie, rape, incest, medical emergencies. I fall into the viability argument because I have a cousin who works in the NICU. My cousin fights to keep premature babies alive so, while Pro-Choice, she can no longer support abortion post viability and I agree. Once a fetus could be a premature birth I find it impossible to excuse an abortion at that point. \n\nI also have been enthralled by the research behind [artificial wombs](https://amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/27/parents-can-look-foetus-real-time-artificial-wombs-future) that would allow for women mid miscarriage to have their fetuses removed and implanted in artificial wombs, thus saving the fetus, but because of my cousin I am aware of a potential conundrum. If this technology becomes available it would mean that previous viability will be forever altered. \n\nI however do not think abortion should be banned due to the shit hitting the fan scenarios. I do however think abortion should be regulated similar to how it is in Europe. The funny thing is many European countries regulate abortion more than most US states. I find the European regulations acceptable for the reasoning behind them. Sadly many people think regulation is the same as banning so my alignment is often mistaken.",

Regulation is NOT the same as banning and people think if anyone is okay with regulation they must be pro-life. No. Many regulations are things that people do not realize, example, an abortion is safer for the mother prior to the 20 week mark. Many people have a morality issue with viability. Example, my cousin is a nurse, she works in the NICU, and while she is Pro-choice, she fully supports banning abortions after 20 weeks unless medically necessary because she deals with premature births and she finds it upsetting to hear about post 24-week abortions. Regulations are not always bad.",

She told me that she cannot defend 24-week abortions or later because she has fought to keep 24-week and later babies alive. To allow abortion of fetuses that are identical to the premature babies she fought to keep alive seems hypocritical. I agree. When it is an outlier case, I agree things should be case by case, but for a basic convenience abortion, I cannot excuse why some women can wait until the fetus is viable outside the womb. Viability SHOULD be a regulating point. I also think women\u2019s safety is more important than you pretend. Abortions should be performed only by doctors. Abortions should be performed in hospitals just in case of abnormal accidents.",

Most doctors agree that the ten year old would have been granted one by Ohio standards, but the mother did not want that so she took her daughter out of state for one. That was why I kept saying review. If you actually want an abortion post heartbeat in Ohio, the case is reviewed. Because the girl\u2019s case was never reviewed, the Ohio law was not tested so we cannot use her case for an example of why the Ohio law is bad. That has been my point. I NEVER said she should not have had the abortion. I never said she should have been risked.

Because you never looked at the article you have no idea what I was referencing when I said \u201creport.\u201d You are so blindly obsessed with abortion than you have zero idea what I am actually saying that you are literally making up an argument with me. \n\nI never said the doctors NEVER reported. I said that the Indianapolis doctor broke the story to REPORTERS. She eventually did report to police but she is currently under investigation because she leaked this story to media. You like to pretend you know the facts here but you are like a person who uses the Spark Notes instead of reading the book. You are missing so many facts. \n\nYou also seem to think healthcare is something you can just do. You can speak, you can pray, you can make a weapon. Unless you are a trained medical profession you cannot heal yourself. Look at the Constitutional rights. Not one guarantees the labor and skill of other people. In fact, our Constitution makes it so people who would demand the labor of other people cannot do that. Slavery is illegal. Demanding anyone just heal you is not a right. \n\nYou seem really ignorant of how the Ohio law works. Abortions are legal, HOWEVER, and you never asked me this because you blindly assume I support the Ohio bill, the law is imperfect. The heartbeat clause is really narrow and it does limit the window of opportunity. The review board reviewing the cases is NOT a barrier. It is a check. Using the dishonest misnomer of \u201cbarrier\u201d makes it sound like there is no way pass. You are either ignorant or you are outright lying. A review board is not an automatic \u201cno\u201d but you are spreading misinformation by acting like it is. You ASSUME every abortion will be rejected but the review is done by DOCTORS and we will NEVER know what a review board would have said with this case because a woman who wanted to protect her child\u2019s rapist took her child across state lines to make sure the rapist was protected. The Ohio bill did nothing to this girl. Her mother\u2019s boyfriend raped this poor child. Her mother dragged her across state lines as fast as she could to protect her boyfriend. The state of Ohio investigated the report of a pregnant ten year old and arrested the girl\u2019s rapist. Looks like the state of Ohio did MORE for this girl than her mother. Because let us make this clear. If you ignore HOW THAT CHILD WAS RAPED AND IMPREGNANTED  and you IGNORE THE ABORTION HAPPENED, you are not here for that child. You are not arguing for that child. You are USING that child as an ABORTION PROP! You are no different than Pro-Life people who make posters of the fetal remains post abortion. \n\nBy the way, because I know you barely read, I don\u2019t support the Ohio bill, but I find it disgusting for people to attempt to lie and use a case that does not apply to argue the bill. This case is not a case against the Ohio bill because the mother was in a rush and went across state lines to avoid the review because the doctors would have to question her daughter extensively for the medical review and the mother did not want that. You are a bad faith actor in this regard and if you REALLY wanted to change the law you would not use this case.",

The law never forced the girl out of state. You can deny the this all you want but you look like a toddler having a tantrum screaming with your hands over your head ears. The ONLY person who made this girl cross state lines for an ABORTION was HER MOTHER. An abortion SHOULD never be needed for a ten year old. Stop saying this was healthcare, this was an evidence destroying mission for the mother because if she actually wanted healthcare for her daughter, she would have put the abortion before the Ohio board. She did not. \n\nYou keep denying my actual stance but you are gaslighting. This child did need an abortion but not for healthcare. Healthcare for a ten year old is a check up. Healthcare for a ten year old is routine vaccinations. Healthcare for a ten year old SHOULD NEVER INCLUDE an abortion...because no ten year old should be raped by their mother\u2019s boyfriend. You want an outlying procedure to count as healthcare so you use that word again and again but you are playing a semantics game to make yourself look good. You care more about the ability to get an abortion than the ten year old girl. You are standing on her to boost your Pro-Abortion stand point. You are not Pro-Choice at this point and you shame the actual Pro-Choice movement with how you further abuse this child. \n\nYou want the story to match yours but the truth is that you are HELPING a pedophile and a pedophile sympathizer because you want to focus on abortion instead of child rape. Nothing you say here admonished the criminals, instead YOU think the AG is the bad guy. To me, the bad guy is the fucking pervert who shoved his cock into a ten year old girl. Every time you comment and you ignore how this child was TRAFFICKED by her mother across state lines to hide a crime of CHILD RAPE you disgust me. You are standing on a child who was raped to hold up a \u201cunrestricted abortion is a right\u201d sign in my eyes. People like you who use victims of sex crimes as excuses for abortion when in actuality over 80% of abortions are voluntary by women who freely choose not to have babies...you make all Pro-Choice people look as disgusting as you.",

(This is the ONLY step the rape hiding mother did in Ohio.) \n\nNow this is important, if there is no heartbeat, a woman CAN GET AN ABORTION IN OHIO IMMEDIATELY.\n\nStep 2 (only if there is a heartbeat in Step 1)- Ask a doctor to recommend the case for abortion review. (The rape hiding mother in Ohio NEVER did this.)\n\nStep 3 - Multiple doctors review the case and either deny the abortion or approve it. (This never happened in Ohio because the rape hiding mother did not have the case recommended.)\n\nStep 4 - The abortion is completed or the person leaves the state to go to another state for an abortion. (This was done because the rape hiding mother skipped Steps 2 and 3).\n\nYou should understand such simple steps. If you do you will respond appropriately.",

The mother never started the process to get an abortion for her post six week pregnant raped daughter. Your  argument that the Ohio law failed this girl is inaccurate and you do know that. You cannot be posting in programming subs and ignoring the simple fact the process was not enacted. You just do not like having an additional step or restriction. However the point that this case does not serve as evidence for your dislike for this law is valid. You mistake me arguing this point as defending the law. The law has flaws, but until Ohio residents vote to change it, it is their law and you can hate it, but unless you are a resident and you vote to change it this is the law.",

The female of the two was initially willing, but then not willing, but was threatened to continue so was willing under duress. So it was a forcible rape law that was under statuatory rape probably because the prosecutor thought it was easier. Just as I said it would. Now the actual defense against the rape case was about how the law only made the male in the case a criminal, the court upheld the ruling, but the law was changed to become gender-neutral to make such an issue not happen again. So your 10 seconds of Googling was wrong. So you look even more like a fool now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, my langauge was slightly ambigous with the \"where that law has been used when two people of a reasonable age have had sexsuch as a 17 year old and another 17 tear old\" phrase. I meant consensual sex. Apparentally everything needs to be spelled out for you. When I was used the example of 16 yr-old and 10- year-old the problem there is the consent, it is why sex with a minor is wrong. Because of consent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd another aspect. If you eventually find a case which is a blatant abuse of the law to just convict a minor who had sex with another, the case will then probably garner the publicity and attention needed to change it. Just like what happened with the gendered language of statuatory rape law relevant to the case you found. You still got a lot more to learn about Americans. Also about your reading your sources.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for Americans, I had an oppurtunity to learn about Slovenia. Given recent elections, about 22.4% of Americans are idiots who voted for Trump. For Slovenia, 13.3% voted for the party of whose leader is described as similar to Trump who also regards Trump as the winner of the 2020 election. So considering what you do, I am going to do the same and say that you are an idiot since you live in a country where people vote for the Slovenian Democratic Party and since 13.3% of your country vote for them, you're all idiots. See how stupid you're being.\n\nedits are grammar and spelling",

Hence why in the posted clip the state in question is trying to pass an abortion law that bans every abortion and leaves no room for edge cases like this 10 year old girl.\n\nPro-choice arguments are in favor of allowing women to chose the rights for their own bodies. Most women don\u2019t want an abortion, it is generally sought out as a last case scenario. However if the decision is left to states and taken from the women hands then there is no option for these women if they are raped etc. Of course they might be able to go to a different state but that puts up economic barriers and disproportionately impacts the poor and underprivileged.\n\nThe pro-choice movement also advocates for better brith control and better sex education to remove the need for abortions. Pro-life tends to try to ban and hamper birth control and planned parenthood meaning that often the number of unplanned pregnancies increases.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to explain this to you in a hopefully strait forward way instead of just downvoting you like everyone else.

No I don\u2019t think people should get the death penalty for aborting a healthy fetus from an accidental pregnancy but it is very serious.

I agree that past a certain point an abortion should no longer be an option and we can debate about the exact time that the point is reached later.\n\nWhat I am trying to say though is that your stance is actually traditionally a pro-choice stance. Pro-life advocates usually allow almost no exceptions to the established abortion rules as demonstrated by the clip shown here. Even including exceptions in your argument pretty much lands you squarely in the pro-choice court. I\u2019m not saying that by allowing abortions we should give absolute free reign but I don\u2019t want to impose my morals and values on someone especially if by doing so I take away a persons right to decide. Like I said there are too many edge cases.\n\nMost pro-life laws are vague when an \u201cacceptable circumstance\u201d comes up in which an abortion would be allowed which only muddies the water more. I personally don\u2019t trust the states government to chose what is ok and what isn\u2019t when it comes to these situations. There are so many edge cases that taking away the ability to chose with blanket abortion bans will cause more harm than good. For example, banning abortions make doctors hesitant to help people in need, who might die without their assistance, because by doing so the doctor risks their own lives and careers. Furthermore the group that seeks to ban abortion also often prevents people from accessing other ways of preventing pregnancy, especially underprivileged people which are the people who need it most.",

If there's no clarification, doctors have to wait until the mother is literally on the cusp of death so they don't get smacked with a murder charge for prophylactically aborting a 8-week pregnancy in a 10 year old.  \n\nWhat's the permissible level of risk for the doctor to make the call to perform an abortion?  If a woman with a severe heart condition comes in with a positive pregnancy test, and the doctor is worried her heart may not be strong enough to carry to term, can they perform an abortion?  What's the level of risk required to keep the doctor legally in the clear?  A 10% risk of death?  25%?  50%?  100%?  \n\nAnd what if the threat isn't death of the mother, but severe and permanent injury?  What's the threshold there?  At what point is preventing permanent disability able to be prioritized over the fetus?   Is the mother allowed to have an abortion so she can continue taking her autoimmune medication or bipolar meds?  Or will she be forced to quit them cold turkey to keep the fetus safe, while she suffers the physical and mental fallout of her unmedicated disorders?  She probably won't die from not taking her meds, so an abortion wouldn't be saving her life, but she's going to be grievously harmed - possibly irreversibly - without them for 9 months. \n\nThese aren't outliers.  These aren't fringe edge-cases.  Situations like these happen every single day.  \n\nThis is the problem with your position.  You *don't even fucking know* what you're trying to advocate for or how to carve out exceptions. And no matter how many exceptions you try to add in, you're **guaranteed** to miss more, invariably causing death and serious injury.   Politicians and lobbyists aren't doctors, how can they write an exception for conditions and situations they don't even know exist?  \n\nAnd I can already foresee your proposed solution: \"Just leave it up to the doctor's discretion, and maybe have a second doctor sign off that they agree.\"  That sounds fine and dandy doesn't it?  Well **we already fucking tried that** with third-trimester abortions, leaving it up to the mother's doctor to decide if a late-term abortion is medically necessary to protect her life or health.  But then the absolute goblins on your side started building up these bullshit strawman scenarios of doctors performing 39-week abortions on healthy pregnancies because \"mom will be kinda sad if she has a baby, this protects her mental health.\"  Despite the fact that *that doesn't actually happen,* it was enough for you to rip away any kind of decision-making capability from doctors and put it in the hands of ignorant politicians instead.  \n\nThe goons on your side of the debate think leaving any kind of exception for \"health of the mother\" means doctors will just lie and abort babies in the birth canal or whatever nonsense propaganda you guys concoct.  You think you're being gracious and compassionate by leaving in a vague \"life of the mother\" clause, but spare no mental bandwidth about what that even means.",

Politicians and lobbyists aren't doctors, how can they write an exception for conditions and situations they don't even know exist? \n\nYes, human judgement and foresight is often imperfect. However this doesn't mean we shouldn't generally create and enforce law just because some individuals will fall victim to its oversights. It is a process of trial and error whereby we attempt to perfect legislation to fairly serve everyone as time goes on.\n\nAnd you're right, we *should* include the experts onto the matter, I'm not against that. Just like with this situation in Ohio - it's ugly, but I do believe this 10 year old girl should have been entitled to an abortion instead of getting tangled up in bureaucracy. Hopefully this occurrence will be a teaching moment for Ohio's legislature and possibly the legislature of other states with regulate abortion to such a degree.\n\n> \"Just leave it up to the doctor's discretion, and maybe have a second doctor sign off that they agree.\" That sounds fine and dandy doesn't it?\n\nYa, that does seem dandy. \n\n> Well we already fucking tried that with third-trimester abortions, leaving it up to the mother's doctor to decide if a late-term abortion is medically necessary to protect her life or health.

Lithium for example can be used to treat bipolar disorder while at the same time posing a minute risk (0.1% - 0.2%) to fetal development.\n\nThat doesn't do her any good if there isn't any other option, either because it literally doesn't exist, or it contraindicates other medication/conditions she has, or those drugs haven't been effective treatment for her in the past.  But fuck anyone who needs Leflunomide for rheumatoid arthritis, or Ribavirin for hepatitis, or Valproate for their bipolar, or Bosentan for their pulmonary artery hypertension, amirite?  They'll probably *survive* without those drugs for 9 months, so who cares what permanent damage in inflicted eh?  My guess is you've never even heard of those drugs, so how would you know you need to carve out an exception for them?  \n\nYou're dancing around the question asked here.

We don't believe it's moral to kill human life just because it's unwanted, especially when the person doing the killing is the one solely responsible for that life. \n\nAnd like it or not, you pro-abortionists *do not* have the final say on the matter.

There's the fact that most birth control messes with a womans body to unbelievable levels, and abstinence never works because guess what women are allowed to have sex. \n\nNot to mention abortions are extremely invasive and painful and no one enjoys getting them.

People talk about what the child could grow up to be but not about what their childhood is going to be like.\n\nI'm not even sure what's worse - a poor family struggling to support a child or the child going into the foster care system.",

She wasn\u2019t, according to her doctor that 10 year old could have gone on to have a healthy pregnancy. That\u2019s my problem. We should have never put these laws into place. You take my correction of her saying the child would fit into an exemption that she never did.  You can be mad, you all can downvote me to oblivion I don\u2019t care, the real outrage is that these laws are set up to cause undue suffering for every fertile uterus owner regardless of age.\n\n\nAnd that needs to be more widely known",

I would put it maybe as you have, an infringing of women rights. An idiocy in general. As of the enslaving, I agree that enslaving was many times a consequence of war many years ago. Now I never said that the terminology was something extremely important or important at all, I simply said that saying it is a war sounds intense. I don\u2019t care if you want to call it a war or not because it is absurd either way.

If you don\u2019t remove it, eventually the penis explodes, not to mention the severe pain & trauma carrying that fetus in the wrong for months place can do to the rest of the body.\nI\u2019m being ridiculous but this actually happens inside a woman\u2019s body sometimes & these laws don\u2019t protect those cases. I\u2019m not a human medical doctor but I\u2019ve seen, over &over again, the damage from that type of pregnancy has on other organs in people\u2019s pets. These women will die if/when their Fallopian tube explodes in the inside of their body. That\u2019s absolutely insane to me. And no hospital will help, they\u2019ll be afraid of being sued.\nDon\u2019t even get me started on what pregnancy & birth do to immature mammals.

Which is why we have people charged with murder and people that get charged with manslaughter. Killing a life is not necessarily murder if we are using the legal definition. Which we should since we're talking about abortion being legal or not.\n\nNow, you might FEEL like it's murder, and that's fine. But we shouldn't be able to dictate other people's actions based on how you feel.\n\n>For the second question\u2026 no because the mother didn\u2019t cause the death. \n\nHer body absolutely did. Women's bodies keep fetuses alive. If a fetus dies, then the woman's body did not keep it alive. That would be manslaughter if we are calling abortion murder. If you or I kill someone and didn't mean to, you still get charged.",

We don't force people to have their body used to support another life. If a 3 year old needs a kidney, we don't force anyone (even the parents) to donate a kidney. That's because bodily autonomy is important.",

Do we have evidence that people weren't thinking twice about it? And the states that have banned abortion aren't making people think twice, they're scaring people with the threat of criminal charges for deciding something about their own body. And they're just going elsewhere, either another state or some black market way, to get the abortion. Having someone tell you what you can and can't do isn't some preventative masure, it's a fear tactic and that's really fucked up.",

Swalwell said in a statement to Axios this week that he provided information to the FBI about her and that he hasn\u2019t interacted with her in six years.

Therefore, an operation like an abortion that is done with the intent to save the life of the would-be mother is ok as the termination of the pregnancy is no longer the main intent, but rather a side effect of the procedure. The main intent is to save the life of the person carrying the pregnancy.\n\nAFAIK this is considered okay in some religious circles, but feel free to correct me.",
