You pedos are just really loud about it for some reason.\n\nedit: the fact that I'm downvoted proves that the early voters on 4chan threads have mostly pedophiles. I've noticed that a lot of times I tend to go negative early on and then bounce back up into positive once the heterosexuals wake up and start browsing.\n\nAlso, I used to date a cam girl. She only had A cups originally and was a skinny azn girl. Pedos flocked to her because she was a barely legal skinny azn that was somewhat flat. Then she got fake tits. She looked 10x hotter. Her income went from a $80/hr average to a $130/hr average almost overnight. Her audience doubled or tripled. BUT OH BOY DID THE PEDOS SEETHE. Random haters would join her chat just to talk shit and try to hurt her feelings for getting fake tits. What a bunch of assholes.",

(2) silicone implants feel natural and are completely soft in most cases. The implant itself is never hard, the hardness comes from the woman developing excessive scar tissue to encapsulate the implant, which does not happen in most cases.

Answer: I don't think consistency is the point. Man contains multitudes. Parables are meant to be considered, meditated upon, not taken literally.\n\nI went to a church for half a year (gf's church). It was such a joke, there was literally a band that played Christian rock covers to pad out the service. I joined because it's something to do and it forced me to learn a few songs every week, also to impress gf. Glad I'm not a teenager anymore...\n\nAnyway, a member of the church found a pedalboard at a pawn shop and the pastor literally thanked God that they had the opportunity to waste over a hundred dollars in church donations so I could have a more accurate guitar tone. To play shitty corporate Christian rock. So the pastor didn't have to do a full hour sermon.\n\nThat fucking pastor, man. Watching the guy deliver his sermon twice really shows you how fake it is. I ended up reading most of the New Testament during his sermons because I'd rather get it from the source than from a con man with a fancy car. (Obligatory: plenty of pastors are legit.)\n\nI'm an atheist btw. I never talk about it but it seems relevant here.",

The morality should still be there and we should be able to see if it is good or not. As I understand it, this is basically the idea of Natural Law. Humans have certain rights and morals that sort of emerge by themselves in the general way we resolve conflicts and decide what is right and just. We may get it wrong on occasion - look at the atrocity of slavery and things like the Holocaust - but as a whole we tend towards finding those things that are moral.\n\nThe people who scream about needing it to be tied directly to Christianity usually are talking about their version of Christianity and are pushing an agenda. I feel like it isn't a huge stretch to see that parts of Christianity are run by very flawed humans and I personally fucking hate this idea of anyone who preaches can't be challenged because they're preaching with some magical authority. Even the parts of my faith I like, I am willing to acknowledge may be wrong and my own interpretation may just be an attempt at a dumbass ape to comfort himself and not go insane.\n\nI just said it very poorly.",

Greek philosophers addressed morality before Christianity existed, and many present moral theories/systems owe nothing to Christianity. Someone could twist the gospel into Utilitarianism, but I wouldn't buy it. They could argue \"the true morality is based on Christ\" but that's just an assertion.\n\nAs for the conclusion...\n\n>all law should be based on their interpretation of the bible\n\nThere are worse systems. I'm not for it, but if they want to set up Christopia and not force it on the rest of us, more power to them.",
