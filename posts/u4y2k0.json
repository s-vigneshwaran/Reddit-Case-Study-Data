  "text": "TIFU by discovering a dark secret from a sex tape I made\nSo about 2 years ago, I was still living in my strict religious parents' house and the only way for me to find a place to have sex was to use my dad's office. My dad owns a small advertising business so on some weekends, I'll use the excuse of needing better network and needing to concentrate to get the keys to the office and have the girl meet me there. I know he and his staff never come to work on the weekend.  \nSo I was with this girl at the time and she was freaky af and asked if I had ever made a sex tape. I had, but as a gee, I knew the correct answer at that point was no, and once I said that, she pulled out my phone and placed it somewhere and we started to get freaky. I jerked off to it a couple of times after that at home (still my parent's house) before it became stale and I hid it and never really got back to it.  \n\n\n2 years later and I'm now living in my own house and I have a girlfriend who's out of town for a few months. I was telling her about the sex tape and she didn't like that I still had it and told me to delete it. I decided to give it one last jerk off before deleting it, so I hit a blunt, plugged in my headphones and started watching like I had done a couple of times years before. It was late at night. I started to beat myself off, listening to this girl moan over the background noise of a movie we were playing to mask our noise... till I heard a deep voice (we'll pretend my name is Manny) in my head say clear as day \"Manny why? Why??\"  \nI jumped out of my chair. My door was locked. No one was in the house with me. I was panicking. Was this my conscience talking??? Is my girlfriend a witch??? Is this because I'm watching a video she doesn't want me to watch?? I'm panicking as hell becuase it fucking scared me how clear the voice was. I wanted to watch the video again, but I honestly was too scared so I walked around the house for a bit, just to let the highness fade, in case that was what was responsible for me hearing voices.  \nOnce I was a little sober (still very shaken up) I decided to start the video from the beginning but to focus this time. So I sat in my chair, dick in my pants (it definitely had no interest in rising again), headphones on, studying this video like it's my finals. While listening, I noticed that while I was blowing her back out, there was a little ruckus in the background separate from the direction the movie sound was coming from. My ears perked up. It was a conversation in the background. Someone had opened the office door\n\n\"Oh the lights are on. Is Manny in the office.\"  \n\"I think so, the TV is on.\"  \n\\*some silence  \n\"Oh my God! Manny! Oh my God, why?\"   \n\"Why? Manny? Why??\"\n\nFrom the voices, I could tell one of them was my dad. I can only imagine the other person was my mum but I can't confirm because it was a bit further back. I have no idea what they were doing in the office that day but they definitely walked in on me, their good little boy, fucking a girl like an animal. And from the audio, they seemed to have stuck around a while after that (weird). This girl and I were absolutely lost in our oxytocin world, completely clueless that we had spectators.   \nI must have missed it all those times I jerked off to it because I never jerked off with both earphones on in my parent's house (always gotta be alert) and the TV noise just drowned the background sound then.   \nThe coincidence is still baffling to me because I would have never found out if this girl hadn't suggested we make a sex tape. My parents definitely never mentioned anything to me about it. A lot of shit started to make sense because that was around the period where they clamped down on my freedom (which eventually led to me leaving the house) and started becoming hostile to me.   \nThe hardest part was explaining to my girlfriend the discovery I had just made. \"Hey babe, you won't believe what I found in the sex tape you told me to delete\".  \n\n\nTL;DR: Watched a sex tape years after making it only to discover that my parents had walked in on me having sex while I was making it.\n\nEdit 1: Thanks to Reddit, I now have the image of my dad being there with someone who wasn\u2019t my mum to do the same thing. Unlikely though because the person would have to be very familiar with me to have the kind of conversation she was having with my dad. No such person. \n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m a trash person for watching it again while with my girl. For context though, I\u2019m a sex addict who hadn\u2019t gone two days without sex in about a year till I quit cold turkey to start a relationship with someone who I wouldn\u2019t be able to see for about 4 months. It didn\u2019t seem like a smart decision seeing I was bound to fail, but I made it because I lucked out with someone who truly truly understands me. Sorry to disappoint the few of you hoping she left me. She didn\u2019t. And when she sees this, I hope she knows I\u2019m forever grateful to have her.",

He said on weekends he would use the excuse of needing better network in  order to get the keys to the office. That gives the impression he didn't have a key that he could use to access the office anytime he wanted, but rather when he wanted to go in he had to ask his Dad and then when he is finished he had to return the key. You may be right but OP's wording sounds like once the key had not been returned his parents would know he was likely still at the office.",

OP jacking off to said tape is clearly in the wrong. I don't think there's any other way to see this. \n\nIf my gf told me that me having nudes of my ex on my phone made her uncomfortable and I said \"ok you're right I'll delete it\", I'm clearly in the wrong if I immediately go and jack off to those pics. That's a clear violation of trust and just outright being dishonest to your partner. If that doesn't make you a shitty partner, idk what would. Unless we have some wild evidence that OP's girlfriend likes being lied to and having her wishes explicitly betrayed, OP is kinda a bad boyfriend in this post.\n\nI won't even get into the fact that jacking off to your ex is textbook emotional cheating.",

I find it interesting that it was so downvoted when it was a comment on maintaining a level of individuality in a relationship. \n\nI really can't even see anything in what I said that's so wrong. Yes relationships are about merging into a cohesive team, but a team is only as strong as its weakest member. Maintaining individual strength is a key in team strength. \n\nWhen you enter a relationship, it's a pact to love each other and be a team. Both people agree to say \"hey, you're my bread and butter\". That doesn't mean that you can't cherish the memory of the pasta salad you ate 3 years ago that's nothing more than a bit of extra happiness to you. It crosses the line when it goes from cherishing to indulging. That is assuming your relationship even defines that as a line. \n\nCrazy man, not everything is 2D.",

But watching a sex tape you made with an ex while in another relationship (with a person who has explicitely asked you not to) is immoral... It's different from watching porn with people you don't know. Immoral means \"not conforming to accepted standards of morality.\" and Morality means \"principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior.\" Most people view the behavior mentioned in this post as unnaceptable and wrong, even if it is something that commonly happens. So it is, by definition, immoral. It is WRONG to do this. Obviously watching yourself have sex with your ex isn't on the same level as having sex with your ex, but it's in the same realm. It's fucked to do that when you are in a relationship with someone else (again, especially a person who has explicitely told you that they aren't okay with that.) If you want to watch videos of yourself haveing sex with an ex, get in a relationship with someone who is okay with that. But doing it while in a relationship with someone who has explicitely said they aren't okay with that is wrong.",

(although the fact he was using it \"one last time\" is wrong, sure. I'd certainly never do it) But everything you said didn't really relate to anything that actually happened. He didn't \"frequently\" do anything while with his current gf, he literally says he only viewed the tape twice in his whole life (years ago) before this one time.\n\nAnd talking about issues of disrespect, you say \"telling them\" like it would be better if he was dishonest and didn't tell her about it at all... Wtf (you don't know her preference, some people want to be told...). People in relationships make mistakes, and different people view those mistakes with different intensities based on what they agree is and isn't okay. His girlfriend was obviously understanding enough to know it wasn't that big of a deal (to them, in their relationship. not that it isn't a big deal to other people in different relationships. Again, everyone has different and varying degrees of right/wrong specific to their relationship). But your whole comment kinda blew the original post out of proportion, based on what the OP actually wrote. \ud83d\ude02",

Firstly, do you understand how many people in those videos who were mentally ill, addicts, raped, underage, or otherwise were not even in a position to consent in the first place? Platforms like pornhub refuse to take down videos of people being assaulted. That's insane. There's always going to be people down to make porn and keep it up, it's not like suddenly porn is going to fall of the face of the planet, but it's an industry that in its current form is highly unethical, and giving the people whose bodies are in the videos power over those videos would go a long way to make sure the porn you consume is entirely ethically made and isn't exploitation. \n\nYour second point is completely offhand. People's autonomy is more important than the pleasure of someone else, but people's safety is the most important thing. Just because people are mining your data, (which is also unethical and there's a huge push to make it more ethical by requiring consent that's fully understood and being able to revoke consent at any time and remove your data) doesn't mean that it justifies exploiting people's bodies for gain or pleasure.",

On top of that, I kind of feel like the girlfriend would be the one to cross the line in that situation. If you are being respected when you ask him to throw it out and he agrees to, but wants to watch it one last time. Well, relationships should have compromises and getting upset about something he made or did before he knew her when he\u2019s throwing it out as she asked seems disrespectful and immature on her side.

For example, being able to see the other person's face during doggy is great.  I would say my friend is also naturally talented as a porn cinematographer.  When your intention is to make a great sex tape, you're allowed to discuss things like what kind of lighting you want to use in detail beforehand, when all my prior sextapes that just wasn't something that was going to be discussed.  \n\nWe also took the kink questionaire together in the past and sent it to each other.  This allowed us to play up several aspects for the other person that normally either of us would hesitate to bring up during sex.\n\nYour favorite video probably involves your own kinks, so I can't imagine it's going to be as great for any random, but for us, personally, my friend and I went straight to intentionally being performative for the other person who we knew exceptionally well and that made all the difference.  E.g., when they asked me \"can I come yet please?\", I knew without guessing that the answer was \"no, you're not allowed to come until I tell you\".  And of course there's little details like getting to use a sex toy on them that I bought for them on their birthday after their old one broke or me recognizing they're using a technique they described for me long ago.  For me, it was an unprecedented amount of intimacy while still being exciting and new because we had only had sex a handful of times prior.\n\nNo, we are not together, and we are both happily in relationships with our respective SOs and have not made any sexual overtures to each other in years.  It remains a valued friendship, if necessarily a little less close when we are both in good relationships.",

That\u2019s a whole separate issue.\n\nMy partner and I both keep nudes and sex tapes from our previous relationships. I\u2019ve never seen a reason to delete them.

I suppose there's gotta be some people who truly don't, but I just don't see any difference really. What's the difference between looking at some old photos, and remembering the encounter in vivid detail?\n\nI personally would never even ask my partner what she thinks about while masturbating, that's her business and we're in a very healthy relationship. That said, I definitely have pulled up some old pictures on occasion. I don't find it odd and it doesn't affect my feelings for her at all. \n\nI find 'gun to your head' monogamy concerning. It's like thought-policing, which leads to resentment. \"You better not find that other woman attractive, or else!\" There should be trust in a relationship, and to me, part of that trust is believing in the commitment to one another.",

You're also completely dead wrong.  No guy watches videos of their ex because they want to remember \"how good they were in bed\"...they just want to remember how it made THEM feel.  If the guy still has feelings for the ex, yes, that's a real problem.  Having pictures/videos, etc. from the time that you were together?  Hardly a problem, unless they would rather look at those than have a healthy sex life with their current partner.  \n\nIf you don't want to use a diary as an example (although I believe holding onto a diary is honestly worse depending on the content), let's just use regular photos (not nude).  Do you feel it would be acceptable to ask a SO to delete photos of their ex?  Because I can tell you for sure that seeing regular photos of an ex can be just as, if not more effective at making you miss them and the times you shared than a sex video, the function of which is to get off.\n\nWhat if there was the technology to remove specific memories?  Would it be acceptable to ask your SO to remove all memories of their ex?  I would hope everyone would say no, but this is the point I'm trying to prove...holding onto photos/videos, etc. should be at the discretion of that individual.  It's perfectly appropriate for an SO to say they don't feel comfortable with it, but having essentially an ultimatum of \"delete this or else\" is pretty messed up.  More so than having one last wank before you dispose of the media.",

With several other sibling doing sports I had times where I could bring someone over alone, and have no interruptions. That was until the night came around that my dad walked in the room and saw me mid thrust into my girlfriend, both very naked, but not sure how to react. He just stood there for like a split second, and we both froze. His only words were: I\u2019m going to get your mom, I\u2019ll be back in fifteen minutes. Then he walked out to the car, and drove off. Dad never called me gay, ever again",

Now when they do stiff currently and should know better after I have addressed things with them, that is a different story.\n\nHere is a good example. I found out in college I had adhd. My parents never got me checked out as a kid and I am not mad about that(I am and my school didn't do anything because I showed symptoms they did notice, but I was a girl with good grades so they didn't care). I am pretty sure 90% of my extended family has undiagnosed adhd so nothing seemed different or off about me to them. However, freshman year of college a therapist mentioned to me I might have adhd and I should find a psychiatrist to diagnose me. I brought this up to my mom because I didn't understand how it all worked and asked her help to find one. She flipped out, told me I wasn't trying hard enough, don't you dare ever take medicine for it, it will ruin your life having a diagnosis. But I was literally failing out of college. I behind her back with the help of friends got myself diagnosed, started seeing a therapist and psychiatrist regularly, and gasp I started taking meds. I also got accommodations for taking tests. If I didn't get the diagnosis I would have dropped out of college.\nSo like I said I am not mad about them not catching it in me as a kid, but I am mad and not forgiving them for the fact that they tried to prevent me seeking help as an adult after a professional said I should.",

You don't know OP, you don't know his history when it comes to his ex and the weight of deleting an irreplaceable video of her.  Fundamentally if you feel like this is such a huge offense, you should be against couples making sex tapes ever.\n\nNow, I will grant you that it's more than a little fucked up that his reaction to being asked to delete it was to smoke a blunt, put headphones on, and jerk off to it in a ritualistic kind of way.  Sure.  But I have an issue with the reaction to that being, he's trash, his new gf should be disgusted and dump him on the spot.\n\nThe people who are saying this must view relationships as an expendable, replaceable thing, and that the value of any artifacts relating to the ex as diminishing to zero value the moment you meet the next person.  That's not how it works.\n\nWhat if he dated his ex for 10 years, they were in love and the relationship ended in heartbreak, and new gf has been in the picture 3 months.  I might agree that she has the right to ask him to delete the video.  But knowing that the new gf might be out of the picture in weeks--because who the fuck knows, it's too early to tell--can you really not find it in you to forgiving him for feeling some sort of sentimentality towards the video?\n\nI think there's degrees to this sort of thing that make it so his behavior is forgivable in some circumstances.  If you really think this is always a breakup-able offense, then you should probably just marry the first person you meet or exclusively date people where you're that person's first.",

The wife decides to drive so I decide to run back upstairs to our apartment to hit the dab rig one more time. Apartment is empty. Everything is off because we were about to be gone for a couple of days. I hit the dab rig and then go to head out of the bedroom and as Im leaving a hear a womens voice say something. Not sure what she said but it was clearly a womens voice speaking some kind of warning to me, I fucking jump like WTF. Like I know I heard a voice. It was so clear. Look around like ok im just too stoned dunno WTF that was but ya I just had some kind of otherworldly experience. Goosebumps, realize I left my sunglass in the room. Nope not going back in there, lock the door and leave.\n\nSpend the next 2 days sleepless in hotel bed out of sheer terror. Return home and I still havent said a word about this to my wife but ya im tweeking out going back in there...We get home and nothing happens. I dont ever hear the voice again and I move on wife my life until my kids birthday rolls around an my wife pulls out a bluetooth cat speaker that she had bought at some point as a gift. She tells me to plug it in to charge it so its good when she unwraps it and when I plug it in it says \"Warning battery low\" \n\nSo ya months later my ghost is a cat speaker...",
