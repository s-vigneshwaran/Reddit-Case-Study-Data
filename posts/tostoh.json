It would be like telling someone that you don't like the way their face looks.  \n\nI'm not insecure about my height, but it's very easy to feel unattractive and unwanted after comments like that.",

If I have sons with a woman closer to my mom's height, the odds of me having short sons who struggle to get dates is extremely high.  I struggle already for a whole host of other reasons as it is haha.  Imagine if this is actually a selection pressure that leads us to dividing into two different species hundreds of thousands of years from now; girls on Tinder don't give guys below six feet a chance :p",

I only responded to confirm what was written in the comment I replied to, and that was the language used so I also used it, because that\u2019s what you do if you want someone to really hear you. He said misogynist so I did too. Look, I\u2019m not conducting therapy or an evaluation, I\u2019m on Reddit during personal time and I have zero clinical responsibility for this person. I am also a human with opinions who sees bullshit and calls it out, albeit with a whole lot of knowledge about the human condition. I actually thought my reply might nudge the commenter to do a little introspection that could lead to growth and it seems to have made a positive difference given the way the comments evolved (at least after I was told to shut the fuck up). It may have been harsh, sure, but sometimes that\u2019s what it takes to dismantle the patriarchy.",

To echo my previous statement, there is a reason why domestic violence against women garners more attention - the average man is capable of killing the average woman with his bare hands.\n\nYou're right to worry for her.

They just see 6\u2019 online and assume that\u2019s normal tall.\n\nI know some 6\u20192\u201d+ people and they freak me out because they\u2019re the only people that can actually see over me like I see over everyone else",

We like to think we\u2019re so evolved but when it comes to sex and reproduction, we\u2019re still pretty damn primitive. It\u2019s the 80/20 rule, men are hardwired to want to fuck 80% of the female population and woman are hard wired to want to fuck the top 20% of the male population. It only takes one male to impregnate a lot of women. There\u2019s been lots of psychology studies to back it up. Not saying there aren\u2019t lots of other factors today in picking a mate and partner but dating apps have enabled people to be ultra selective on the pure carnal side of mating which has further exemplified how we haven\u2019t come as far as we think when it comes to certain base biological functions.",

The height difference may not have been enough of a problem were that the case. Who knows!\n\nYeah. I\u2019d date a guy who was 5\u20197\u201d without any issue. The men that I did date who were shorter than me, even when it was just one inch or we were the same height, it seemed like a bigger problem for them. Probably due to being rejected over height and told it over and over again, making them feel like they *should* be insecure. And that blows my mind. I just never understood why that was so important to some women. MEN CAN HAVE TIP TOE, MOVIE KISSES TOO DAMN IT. :D haha\n\nNot sure if you\u2019ve had to deal with it or not but if you ever do, just keep in mind that someone who is going to immediately reject a date based on height and use it against you in conversation as though it\u2019s abhorrent prrrrobably isn\u2019t someone you want to spend any time or effort on anyways.",

You cannot just decide to be born with genes that make you taller.

Your position, to me, is ass-backwards from how it should be.\n\nLook, a fat person can lose weight, 99.9999999999% of the time. Short people cannot grow taller.

It's just an asshole move.\n\nNot quite the same situation but consider the Mitch Hedberg joke \"I used to do drugs.

But, not everything is rational.\n\nI remember this distinction back in my former Christian days. I'd see people saying that the Bible has \"no logic,\" and I always thought, \"what the heck, it's full of logic.\" Then I'd have to argue that it has logic. Eventually, the atheist would finally be like \"okay chill it has logic, fine. But, it's shit logic and isn't rational.\" And I'd pull my hair out and say, \"why didn't you just say that then!? That's not the same claim!\"\n\nI realize now that the two words are colloquially used interchangeably. But, they're not actually synonyms. Also see: \"hypothesis\" vs \"theory,\" where this same dynamic occurs.",

That was what I argued as well, so I'm confused by your \"you can't apply that\" claim. \"You must be at least 6 ft\" doesn't imply that she necessarily *will* date you if you are at least 6 ft tall, only that she *won't* date you if you are under that height.\n\nOther additional requirements unrelated to height that she didn't specify initially wouldn't conflict with the \"You must be at least 6 ft\" requirement either, such as \"you must not be ugly.\" The only thing she could do that would be logically inconsistent with \"You must be at least 6 ft\" would be to date someone under 6 ft. If she also required that your height also be *under* 6 ft in order to date her, that would just imply that the set of people she was willing to date is the empty set.",

In normal human conversation, it would be natural to assume that 6 ft is tall enough to date her. But by strict application of logic, all her statement implies is that she will not date anyone shorter. No more, no less. Other possible restrictions, whether they relate to height or not, are allowable, but we are not aware of any at this point.\n* She states that 6'2\" is not tall enough to date her, an additional requirement that constrains the set of potential suitors even further. It was misleading not to mention this before, but further restrictions not previously mentioned are allowable.\n* We can then conclude that if there are any people she is willing to date, those people must be over 6'2. A person who is over 6'2 is necessarily also at least 6 ft tall, so her initial condition would also be satisfied by such a person. But we still don't have enough information to determine the minimum height she would find acceptable.

They know that every guy wants them, so they can afford to only talk to the top 3 percent and will be kept busy with that. The supply of those guys seems inexhaustible. \n\nBut at the same time they aren't looking for attributes that really matter, just what you can measure on a profile, and those guys understand their power so no commitment is likely a key part of any relationship with them.",

He was also really nice and funny. However, the whole time at the dance and hanging out after, all I could notice was that my head was at his chest level and I had to look up to talk. When doing that, I felt like literally having to look up to someone to interact get too much like talking to a parent or authority figure and absolutely hated it, so it never went anywhere. I always preferred people \u2018at my level\u2019 so to speak. Some of the super tiny girl plus giant guy idolization I see strikes me as borderline creepy.",

But honestly, I got a weird vibe that she really only likes tall guys. It kind of pissed me off for some reason but I'm over it now. I guess it's her preference, but it really rubbed me the wrong way tbh",

If you have specific preferences, it's better to be honest about them up front. Because the alternatives are to have to say no to people later (awkward for both of you) or date people you aren't really attracted to (bad for both of you).\n\nOnline dating is very much a meat market. If you have requirements, put them out there so you weed out the no-goes early instead of having to lie to them or insult them to their faces later. \n\nBut also be smart and brave enough to put your own statistics out there, accompanied by some figure-revealing pictures. \"If you choose me, this is what you get.\"",

Dude was like 5ft 10 (178 cm) in shoes at best.  So many people are lying about their height because of this kind of insecurity.  I have even seen guys who were lucky to be 5ft 7 (171 cm) claiming 6ft status.  A lot of the times I'm the tallest or one of the tallest people in a room and I am not 6ft tall.\n\nMy question why are all these people chasing unicorns?  It's like asking for a 8 in (20 cm) dick.  That's like 1 in 1000 men right there.  So many good people out there who are not a part of these quite exclusive cohort.\n\nI think these are young, vain people, who don't want an actual relationship with another human but an adornment that hang off their arm like a purse. It's kind of pathetic to me.  I will never understand it.  I hope they grow up. \n\nNo, I have never been rejected because of my height.  Even if I was I don't give shit about things I cannot change about myself.  I am not 6ft but I bet the average women who is like 5ft 4 (163 cm) thinks that I am tall and absolutely indistinguishable from someone who is 6ft.\n\nIt is such a stupid, dumb as fuck arbitrary designatory and men seeking women to date should use it to filter out the assholes to whom height is an extreme filter.\n\nYou can have preferences I don't give a shit, but realise that you are limiting your self to a very small amount of men based on an immutable characteristic.",

I'm not as tall as her though, I'm about 5'8 - 5'9. Doctors have measured me differently, so in between somewhere. lol. Girls did pick on me in school for being taller than all of them. They said awful stuff to me. But then, guys never treated me like that. At the end of the day, many would be taller, and most just a little shorter.\n\nWhen I left school, that all stopped. High school/Scecondary school girls can be horrible, horrible people. College age kids are less bothered about finding people to systematically tear down every day. And besides, there were lots of girls close to my height in my uni class. It was very different.\n\nAnd a uni friend who was like 6'4 said he preferred girls over 5'10. His gf was 6 foot, and gorgeous. What guy wouldn't want to date her. Hahah! I was short to him. So it is definitely a personal preference thing, and my experience has been very different to what you're saying here. Very short guys asked me out too.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|table) Because of how badly society treats couples who have a significant height difference if the man is shorter, I didn't date anyone more than a couple inches shorter.",

People don't care about their personal preferences?? Height is a deal breaker for lots of people.\n\nYour logic is basically \"why post a real photo of you when you could edit it to hide your qualities until you can get them to like your personality more\" or \"just never show pictures of yourself because you're insecure\". Because it's fucking omitting critical information that everyone judges on, deceptive, and people will judge you and reject you to your face when they find out. If a dude doesn't like fat chicks, he likes you, then finds out your 300lbs, he's gonna walk. Same with height. That's the whole point of telling people about yourself on a dating website with pictures and text lol.\n\nIt's so people **who like those qualities** and thus who you are, will find you.\n\nLike, you literally don't understand the concept of tinder or dating websites in general. You don't hide your height out of *shame*, you find someone who is ok with who you are. How tf are people this clueless fr?",

Not why.\n\nWhat exactly are you trying to prove with this article? I am not denying that women have an easier time getting a date. My point is why they have an easier time. \n\nThis article states tinder has less female users than male. Why? Because men generally are willing to take more risk than women. Women are less likely to meet up with a stranger. Why? Because they are more vulnerable. Smaller size (probably can\u2019t win the fight if dude gets aggressive), higher risk for receiving STDs, social backlash (being called a slut for hooking up with someone for example), they are unlikely to orgasm during a hook up, and have to deal with the consequences of accidental pregnancy. \n\nSo now you are left with a pool of women who are somewhat willing to take the risk. They typically try to get to know their dates as much as possible. Which means spending a lot of time talking, meeting in a public place to feel them out, and investing a lot of time and emotional energy (also running background checks). So they filter out everyone except the ones they think they might be willing to gamble on. \n\nIdk why y\u2019all are so heated about it anyways. What are you losing by not matching with them? A good chunk of tinder are bots and sex worker anyways. I matched with and met a couple of different dudes but ended up in relationships with people I knew from college and a guy from my dnd group.

I can't even use a standard BBQ grill - I'm too short to safely reach the lid when it's up, I risk my chest going right onto grill. Back of the stove is a no go if I have something on the front. All my stuff is on the bottom shelves - 2nd shelf is reachable with a single step stool. I also have to use a step stool to retrieve laundry from the bottom of the washer. I retrieve packages from a mailroom and I have to carry a stool with me because sometimes a package is in the top row of lockers and it's just impossible for me to get it (but I can't close it and go back for a stool because that will reset the locker and won't open without the mailman.)\n\nSome things are easier for me because of the height (like dishes, as you mentioned being a pain for you) but there is a scary amount of the world that wasn't built for adults my height or shorter. Cars for example - I sit right up against the steering wheel. My car is small (prius c) but I'm still so short for it. In the event of an accident triggering the steering airbag... it's not gonna be pretty. And the seat belt, even though it's lowered, still goes a little across my neck.\n\nEdit: other thing I remember, because it doesn't happen often, but people either tend to expect me to move out of the way, or they straight up don't see me. I was once whacked and bruised on the face by a very energetic gesturer. I've been walked into a lot too.",

I think you're misunderstanding my point.  \n\nThere are things all of us do without much questioning, because that's just what we do, like a habit.  I grew up taught old gender roles, which are rooted in sexism obviously, but some habits persist. I open doors, I pay on the first date, e.t.c. \n\nMany women habitually don't offer because they grew up taught not to... not because they're entitled. \n\nMy gf didn't offer on the first date. Yet,  now she offers all the time and has never once acted entitled. Not offering to go Dutch on the first date isn't necessarily entitlement.\n\nFor some of us, we just always do it that way. \n\nYes, you should watch for entitled people, but don't assume that someone not offering is entitlement.",

My impersonal \"preferences\" just became \"whatever she is.\" Because she was the person I wanted to be with, not her height, ratios, even hobbies or whatever. Frankly, she had a similar journey in her feelings toward me. \n\nWe've been (very) happily married over a decade. She's my favorite human being. \n\nI think internet dating has some real value, but I also think it has a tendency to make people forget that they are ultimately looking for a person, not a list of statistical attributes.",

We chatted as we played and talked on Steam and Skype for a long time. I got to know him and was attracted to his personality and honesty before I saw him in person many months later. We are also happily married with a cute kiddo.\n\nI think long distance relationships can force people to come closer, because all you can do it talk and communicate. \n\nDating apps are completely different though. It's like, you only pick someone based completely on looks and a bio. It would be cool if there was a dating site with no photos, and it got people together somewhat randomly or based on certain preferences. Maybe after talking for a certain amount of time, you can then send pictures. That would be neat.\n\nIf someone makes an app like that, I'll take 5% of the profits please and thank you.",

The reason men have larger penises versus other primates, by a huge margin, is the same reason. Women prefer it. Does that mean there aren't guys with small penises? No, of course not.\n\nIf you think women have only preferred taller men since social media, then you must be like 18 or something. Ever heard of the term \"tall, dark, and handsome\"? That didn't start with Instagram. Didn't start with Facebook. Didn't start with Myspace or Friendster. Didn't even start with TV.\n\nWomen prefer tall men because it's hardwired from a survival standpoint. Men that are stronger and taller are more likely to survive, especially in the past.\n\nAnd you're not understanding what the word \"prefer\" means here, it seems like. Even if most women prefer it, it doesn't mean that they always end up with it. A guy can prefer really petite women and end up with someone taller or larger. Because they love them and like them as a person. \n\nYour whole point is some confidently incorrect material. And then going all condescending in the end? Come on. This isn't some secret about humanity. Your theory that women just started preferring taller men in the past decade or two is ridiculous.",

I leave you a crumb of thought that will nourish your thoughts for times to come. \nSocio economic status is and was more important than any evolutionary attribute, however, social media and the changing social landscape, paired with certain expectations that follow such an changing environment, change the way humans behave. Humans and their behavior are more complex than genitalia and body composition. You claim that all women are more or less the same with the same preference, thus defeating yourself in this argument. \n\nPlease don't make the \"effort\" and respond because I know that I don't have anything to gain from that and won't therefore answer.",

There is a definite undercurrent of racism in dating, but most guys (and most people) don't sincerely believe that there is no one belonging to particular races that they would never have chemistry with or would never get along with compared to the way many women seem to discount everyone beneath a certain height.",

In my personal experience it actually never helps because it's difficult to hold back without something there to physically prevent them going in too far.\n\nAs for making her cum, most women don't cum during normal penetration sex, anyway. Considering a single finger can be enough, small dicks don't have to be a problem. It's all in how it's used. Too small doesn't dry it up, but pain sure does!",

It's more of a supply and advertising issue.\n\n>being more attracted to your partner will make you feel better.\n\nYeah there are like 10-20 more important criteria for attraction then the size of your dick though. It's very far down on the list.\n\n>You should become more attracted to someone when they take their clothes off.\n\nIdeally yeah, your dick has very little impact on how much more or less attractive you are. She won't even really get to see your erect dick until it's already been inside of her and she's in love with it by that point ;).",

They support me in that you could only find gay subs that represent a fetish.\n\n>Having a bigger dick would make penetrative sex better, how important PiV sex is has no effect on that.\n\nOne, that's speculation, there's even a point where a dick makes you sore if it's too big. You have not established that the bigger the dick is the more pleasurable it is.\n\nTwo, if PIV can't make a woman cum, that means it's of lesser importance in sexual pleasure to other things because cumming is the ultimate height of pleasure. If dick size is only a factor in PIV, then it also shares the unimportance.\n\nSo if non-PIV elements make women cum alone, that means they are significantly more important than PIV to the point where PIV is not even required to make them cum.\n\n>Do you seriously not think foreplay is important?\n\nYou think she's going to get this ideal measure of your dick during foreplay and then go running for the hills when it doesn't add up in her database lol?\n\nThere are many studies showing women, even when dating a man for many years, are **wildy** inaccurate at guessing dick size. Yet you seem to think they could sus it out easily with just their hands in the dark lol.\n\n>No women would love a small penis, your own sources state this.\n\nMy first link was literally a woman gushing over small penises lol.",

Btw, you're dumb.\n\nSomething being far outside the average is the definition of abnormal lmao. Dumpass. So you calling them \"properly sized genitals\" is dumb, since they are by definition, larger than normal.\n\n>Nope, It's from your source.\n\nNa that source agrees with me, your sources agree with me too.\n\n>Women beg to differ, but I guess that leaves more \"men\" with micros for you.\n\nYes women, aka your average r/massivecock user lmfaooooooo. I'm dying \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.\n\n>In every comment, as none of them have mentioned measuring.\n\nMaybe it was yer mum who mentioned it. Sorry was texting her and I might've gotten it mixed up. She was talking about how she could measure my dick in units of your dick. I think she  came to the conversion ratio of 1 MD = 3.4 YT give or take 0.1 YT error tolerance.\n\n>I could tell you if it's big or not. I would definitely have an opinion on whether it was too big or small.\n\nWait so are you saying you've taken enough dicks up your ass to be able to tell the difference between a small and big dick? Just how many dicks have you put up there?\n\n>Source?\n\nWomen.",

There are studies now showing that the majority of women rarely ever cum from penetrative sex, regardless of dick size. There's some \"objective\" evidence right there that dick size is not a huge variable.\n\nNever mind that most women report it not being a big deal and anecdotally it's very easy to see if you go out and actually have sex. You're putting way too much emphasis on the super low level mechanics of sex too. Most women don't give a shit about it, that's the reality.",

We're talking specifically about dick size right now not \"do women care about physical traits\". Women don't care about *all* physical traits and some physical traits they'll care about more than others. I thought this was common sense.\n\n>How so?\n\nI'm not sure how else to explain it my man. To put it as plainly as possible; people care about the experience of reading a book, not the cover, so caring about the cover is a mistake because it is not correlated with a good book. Similar to how caring about how dick size is not correlated strongly with having a good sexual experience.\n\nYou may *think* it matters to your enjoyment and goals, but it does not. You are mistaken.\n\n>There's would still be a difference in pleasure even if you don't cum.\n\nYou're responding to a study with pure speculation. Idk what to tell you.\n\n>There's also the factor of being more attracted to your partner would make the sex better.\n\nNo shit lol, how is that relevant to dick size? Stay on topic holy.",

Why do you think your opinions are fact and that other people can't possibly actually care about dick size because of the difference it makes?\n\nBack to me saying the majority of women don't care about dick size.

More than likely it was the Cosmo magazines that regurgitated in every issue what was and what was not sexy.  They told us short men were jokes. I'm 5'4 wtf am I going to do with someone over a foot taller than me? My partner is 3 inches taller than me and guess what, that's tall enough, he's perfect. Shut down the women that only want you for your height, you're all kings and you deserve love at any height, period.",

She almost didn't date him cause he was so much taller.  My sister and I are 5'5\" and 5'3\" and we grew up looking up at all his relatives.  During that time (60's and 70's) hotel beds were a problem.  Heck, even home beds were way too short. My dad hung over every recliner at mid-calf, so we bought chairs with ottomans instead.  Clothes were hard to find and expensive.  Buying unfinished and hemming yourself was often the best you could do.  He couldn't ride rides at the fair and was too tall even to walk through the haunted house or hall of mirrors. I wonder if life were still making tall people have to go out of their way to even clothe themselves (thank goodness for Big & Tall and Lewis Bryant coming along in the 70s) if women would be so eager to marry a tall man?",

When I was younger I invited this chick over and the first thing she said was \"Jesus are you short\" I'm 5'7 but kinda rude to say first thing.

Told me after ofc. luckily it was female only variant or whatever and I didn't get it. I like plump women anyways but it's truly about personality. I learned that with her the hard way. Not worth it with people who are assholes and think they are somehow better than the rest if they have a tight stomach or a firm ass. That stuff doesn't matter in the long run. She was a hairdresser so maybe it's kinda her job to value superficial things more. After we decided to be just platonic friends I was out with someone else and the hairdresser called if she could join because no friends. I told sure but only if she wouldn't mention our brief romance to my date. Guess what happened? Yeah... she was not fun.\n\nWow that story made me sound like a playboy. That was when I was younger. Been alone 7 years now and quite content being alone.",
